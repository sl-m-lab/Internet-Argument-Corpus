   "Welp, my evil little brain is pretty done computing and I'm *gasp* leaning towards supporting Obama this time.\n \n Let me explain how an evil mind works.\n \n 1) Everything Bush has presided over was intentional. While he thinks it's paving the way for the 2nd coming (dominionist attitudes) the actual fact of the matter is that he's just a sock puppet for the Illuminati.\n We all are but, that's beside the point.\n \n 2) The next president will be a 1 term only president.\n McCain, sorry to say, will be too old to run a 2nd term and Palin won't be a valid candidate for pres...ever.\n That means there will be another shift in 4 years to the opposite side.\n If McCain wins now, a democrat will win in 4 years and visa versa.\n If it's McCain, Clinton may run again in 2012.\n \n But, if Obama wins, it'll be the Anti-Christ (code name for the guy the Illuminati wants to get the world population levels reduced to managable levels) who replaces him.\n And Obama won't be a 2 termer (he'd be lucky to live through 1) because the shat has really hit the fan and will only get worse...prissy boys don't have the fortitude to clean up this level of guano. He'll just spread it around and make more of a mess as prissy boys are wont to do.\n \n 3) Thus, I'm lead to either accept McCain now...or go for gold and get a president who actually knows how to break eggs to make an omlett in 4 years(Bush just sort of set the kitchen up for the great event).\n \n So, since I'm a patient man, know that things won't be cleaned up regardless of who's elected, I think it prudent to awaite the AC.\n Well, actually I'm not thinking at all.\n I'm just regurgitating what my masters told me will be a fact.\n \n I know you all will be wishing you had sponsorship too when the time comes...but, do you really want to have to spend as much time as I do kissing butt? Groveling and engaging in petty wet-work on such subtle level that most people are unaware of the editing going on?\n And this microchip thing iches like a mofo!\n \n And why would I sell out my fellow man?\n \n 'Cause I'm souless!\n Heartless too!\n Oh, and the constant supply of virgins on this world is a pretty good deal.\n Much better than the promise of only 70-something in the mythical afterlife that some are promised for more extreme behavior.\n emoticon_xgood\n Okay...it's not 'constant'. I'm on 6 right now. But, that's because I can be a little sentimental at times. But, 1st sign of a wrinkle and she's outta here.",
