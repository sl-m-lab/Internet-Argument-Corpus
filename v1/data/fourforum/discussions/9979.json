And God, because he is God, can punish his creatures for not obeying those rules. This is not semantics. It simply is not possible for God to commit murder. God is subject to no law, and therefore cannot kill a person in violation of any law.\n \n And it is a gross misunderstanding to suggest that God kills innocent people. There are no innocent people according to Scripture (which appears to be the standard established in this thread). And I don't worship fetuses, as doing so would be idolatry.\n \n \nSecondly, I see you are falling into the usual O.P. of your ilk: when without an argument, attack the opponent on a simple spelling error (especially when the one letter is right next to the one intended on the keyboard \"n\" is right next to \"b\" last time I checked). Really Phyllis, get an actual argument instead of attacking your opponent on spelling errors.\n\n \n No, that was not an argument. It was an illustration of a point. The point was this: that in order to stand in moral judgment of God, you would have to be of higher moral character than God. In other words, you would have to be God in order to judge God. Now, the point I made is that this is highly unlikely, as any being claiming to be God would not misspell words, no matter how closely the letters are on the keyboard.\n \n To be clear, I was not attacking you (at least I didn't intend to) by calling out your spelling mistake. I was trying to illustrate a point. And the point was this: you are not perfect, and therefore, you are not God. And if you are not God, then you really cannot stand in moral judgment of God.\n \n \nActually, no, they do NOT. The first three ALL describe God causing them - are you saying the bible is describing God's actions negatively? Or are you saying that killing your precious foetuses is just fine as long as the persons carrying them are \"wicked\". Sorry, but you need to get an argument, Phyllis.\n\n \n I think you have missed the point. The verses you cited all describe the actions as a judgment. That is to say, it is a punishment. Punishments carry with them a negative connotation. The Jews would not have understood those verses to be positive. In other words, the abortions (as you call them) were a bad thing to and not a good thing. They were a negative and not a positive.",

It just goes beyond the text, and to form a conclusion based upon a biased assumption is, well, biased.\n \n I say, and maintain, that this passage does not speak to abortion at all, and to say that it does, to quote you, \"goes beyond the 'text.'\" It goes beyond the facts that are given.\n \n \n \nAs I said, semantics (just as when your ilk claims abortion is murder and when we say no, it really is not and then you guys bitch and moan about us getting into semantics)\n\n \n I doubt you know very much about me or my ilk. I am not playing semantics, though I will always maintain that words have meaning. And in this case the being we call \"God\" simply cannot murder because of the nature of God and the nature of murder are wholly inconsistent.\n \n \nActually, foetuses, which your ilk claims are living humans, have done nothing that can possibly be sinful. And you might not worship them, but it sure looks like it to everyone else.\n\n \n There you go talking about my ilk again. More conclusions that are not based in fact. But I will say this: you seem to have an interesting view of what it is to worship something.\n \n \nYes, I said that it wasn't an argument - it was an attack on my person, on my misspelling a word. And no, I am not God, and neither are you, and neither were the writers of the Bible (which, only through Circular Logic is \"God's Word\")\n\n \n You can continue to distort if you want. But that doesn't make the distortion correct.\n \n \nAnd yet, you and your ilk are the first to moan about not killing a foetus that is the result of a rape/incest case - now, since it is \"God\" doing it, the poor little foetuses (in the women who are being \"punished\") don't matter.\n\n \n There you go again talking about things of which you cannot possibly know.

So I went back and checked out the Hosea passage in context and notice that he did it again. Chapters 8 and 9 are Gods judgement on Israel for their lack of faithfulness and Idolatry as the people of God.Here is what SP posted.\n \n Hsa 9:11 \n As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird--\n No birth, no pregnancy, and no conception!\n Hsa 9:12 \n Though they bring up their children,\n Yet I will bereave them to the last man.\n Yes, woe to them when I depart from them!\n Hsa 9:13 \n Just as I saw Ephraim like Tyre, planted in a pleasant place,\n So Ephraim will bring out his children to the murderer.\"\n \n Hsa 9:14 \n Give them, O LORD--\n What will You give?\n Give them a miscarrying womb\n And dry breasts!\n \n Hsa 9:15 \n \"All their wickedness is in Gilgal,\n For there I hated them.\n Because of the evil of their deeds\n I will drive them from My house;\n I will love them no more.\n All their princes are rebellious.\n Hsa 9:16 \n Ephraim is stricken,\n Their root is dried up;\n They shall bear no fruit.\n Yes, were they to bear children,\n I would kill the darlings of their womb.\"\n \n Hsa 9:17 \n My God will cast them away,\n Because they did not obey Him;\n And they shall be wanderers among the nations.\n \n Note the prophecy regarding the loss of their homeland in the bolded.\n \n Now here in Chapter 11 we see the Lords Fatherly Love, or as Paul Harvey would say, the rest of the story.\n \n Hsa 11:1 \n \"WHEN Israe was a child, I loved him,\n \n And out of Egypt I called My son.\n Hsa 11:2 \n As they called them,[fn1]\n So they went from them;[fn2]\n They sacrificed to the Baals,\n And burned incense to carved images.\n \n Hsa 11:3 \n \"I taught Ephraim to walk,\n Taking them by their arms;[fn3]\n But they did not know that I healed them.\n Hsa 11:4 \n I drew them with gentle cords,[fn4]\n With bands of love,\n And I was to them as those who take the yoke from their neck.[fn5]\n I stooped and fed them.\n \n Hsa 11:5 \n \"He shall not return to the land of Egypt;\n But the Assyrian shall be his king,\n Because they refused to repent.\n Hsa 11:6 \n And the sword shall slash in his cities,\n Devour his districts,\n And consume them,\n Because of their own counsels.\n Hsa 11:7 \n My people are bent on backsliding from Me.\n Though they call to the Most High,[fn6]\n None at all exalt Him.\n \n Hsa 11:8 \n \"How can I give you up, Ephraim?\n How can I hand you over, Israel?\n How can I make you like Admah?\n How can I set you like Zeboiim?\n My heart churns within Me;\n My sympathy is stirred.\n Hsa 11:9 \n I will not execute the fierceness of My anger;\n I will not again destroy Ephraim.\n For I am God, and not man,\n The Holy One in your midst;\n And I will not come with terror.[fn7]\n \n Hsa 11:10 \n \"They shall walk after the LORD.\n He will roar like a lion.\n When He roars,\n Then His sons shall come trembling from the west;\n Hsa 11:11 \n They shall come trembling like a bird from Egypt,\n Like a dove from the land of Assyria.\n And I will let them dwell in their houses,\"\n Says the LORD.\n \n Hsa 11:12 \n \"Ephraim has encircled Me with lies,\n And the house of Israel with deceit;\n But Judah still walks with God,\n Even with the Holy One[fn8] who is faithful.\n \n So you see Phyllis, SP is solid evidence that if one picks and chooses out of context, they can make the bible appear to say anything they want to. But God is not pro-abortion and neither does He condone murdering babies. But you would never get that from what SP posts. And what is most amazing is that this guy actually has the audacity to call himself a christian as if the label carries some weight with the living God.",

It discusses the \"prebirth contract\" between an expectant mother and her baby, which is completely amazing!

Is it that a Christian has to decide Darwin had no credibility yet answer every doctors question regarding family history? If there where any faith, a man would simply say; \"Oh, so thats how God did it!\". \n \n Personally, I believe if God where actually going to talk to man, he wouldn't give law.

   "A woman is born with over 1/2 million eggs in their reproductive system. 1/2 million of something that singularly has the potential of taking their life.\n \n A woman can become impregnated at nearly a yearly rate. Breast feeding does not slow this process.\n \n Any female that gets a disease that harms her immune system or requires a treatment that stuns said system has a high potential of losing her life if a fetus is gestating in her. How many women while pregnant discover they have cancer?\n \n Age is a factor in a woman being able to carry a fetus to term. 15 years and younger have physical issues that can do harm to them. Women over 50 or in Menopause can actually become pregnant and their bodies would have a tuff time carrying to term.\n \n Abortions happen in Mexico, where it is all but outlawed. The Mexican legislators who voted to decriminalize abortion cited the brutal effects of this gap between theory and practice: an estimated 5,000 women die in Mexico every year from botched back-street or self-administered abortions; a further 150,000 have to be treated in hospital every year and 1.5 million abortions happen every year. The penalty for a woman seeking an abortion is 1 to 5 years in prison.\n \n Everywhere on the earth where abortion is outlawed it still happens. The penalty in Saudi Arabia for performing an abortion is death, yet there are doctors that do it and get this penalty. Why?\n \n Nearly every picture you have ever seen regarding an abortion has been a lie. I know, the end justifies the means I guess. But most pictures are of donated fetuses preserved from a college. Most where still born. A Fetus just to the second trimester is only 3.5 inches long. And the brain has just over enough neurons to cause a heart to beat which happens 17 weeks into a pregnancy. Not enough brains for even a heart beat for 3 months.\n \n The Mortality rate on births before birth control was over 20%. This means the baby died and or the mother every five births.\n \n You don't want life. Pro-life is far from being for life. You want to make the choice of who should die. And if the fetus can not come to term then both should die. Because that is what Pro-life means; it means you take the choice from the woman and her medical staff. NO ONE is pro-abortion...That is sick. People are pro-choice, meaning they can not determine who should live or die. That is the choice of the host and her medical professionals who are sworn by oath to do something you can not seem to do. Defend life.\n \n A Fetus can not live without a host. It is parasitic in nature and requires service from a host. One thing any child should be guarantied in life is it gestated in a host that cared about its birth. Of the last five serial killers in the U.S. they had one thing in common among themselves; Just one common thing. They where adopted. Really really..\n \n Fetal gestation requires a person to care for themselves. The fetus has a thin membrane between it and a slow death. Anyone can cause a failure in gestation; the path is as simple to follow as a double yellow line down a highway. Abortion can not be stopped. It has been here even before GOD talked to Moses. Mary whom Jesus defended was a prostitute that had no children. You tell me, how on earth does that happen??\n \n As for the Bibles punishment for aborting a fetus?? Well, I am pro-choice but I think the bibles penalty for causing an abortion on a woman that actually wants the fetus to become a child to be pretty weak. \n \n Exodus 21[22] If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.\n \n The guy that causes a woman to abort?? Oh he is fined...Loses some cash. That will teach him. Funny thing though Pro-life people...I thought the fetus was a human??? Oh and Exodus is the mouth of God stuff, burning bush stuff.\n \n Funny, Pro-choice people would have a cow over this. I think prison should be required for the potential that was lost alone. But that's just me...Good old pro-choice guy.",

I was merely trying to point out that the part of a human that is responsible for thought, emotion, reasoning, and memory is the brain, not a soul.\n\n \n synapses are in a constant state of flux holding what we call a memory and in so doing keeping the individual, individual. We can extend the memory by addressing it and restoring it.\n \n If I disrupt the synapses with electromechanical means or chemical means the memory is lost and I distorted the individual. I changed him, yet no physical damage occurred (I have heard of a scientific group that said they can indeed erase memory).\n \n The real question is: Did I kill him?\n \n My answer is: If I erase his mind I did kill him. The person left behind is completely different than the one before the alteration of energy in the mind.\n \n The mind is like a computer without a hard drive. The energy running the synapses can never be removed without the loss of everything that makes the man who he is. \n \n Some brains can have different independent loops running in it, each operating off the same memories yet having different personalities. This can happen under long periods of stress or failures in development. Currently, we believe this to be incurable for now and we use drugs to suppress the issue. \n \n Many fascinating questions will come up when we are able to stun the other loops and basically kill them. Should we be selective? Determine good and bad souls and such?",

A fish has little emotional baggage. \n \n Some animals though; I would agree, have a soul and it can be troubled. Elephants even visit graves. Water Buffalo remember attack strategies of their enemies and counter them; clearly for the benefit of the herd. \n \n Any animal that feel for another and remember has the chain of a soul. A soul can provide pain without fiscal damage. The pain from a soul can incapacitate an animal as completely as a bullet into the brain. A Dog can be shaped by the memories an owner provides it. A Dog can be a very friendly or a monster.\n \n All souls can be shaped by outside forces and this is the chief reason why man must care for more than himself. In the end, it all affects him.

Pesonally (by revelation not evidence) I think they must go to heaven also since I am sure there must be fishing there else it would not be paradise to fishermen. I assume however that they are released after being caught and somehow the process is made enjoyable to them. And then lets look at cows - they most certainly do cry and given the hard evidence that there are steaks in heaven (Defending Your Life - scene 6) there have to be cows also. Why are we discussing these issues - there is no heaven, no hell, no GOD. Should we not check the basic premise BEFORE getting into the details????",

The host has to cooperate for a viable child to come into being. The path to the fetus is so simple to follow a child could do an abortion. Only a thin membrane protects the fetus.\n \n In Mexico there where nearly a million abortions when it was illegal. 800,000 hospitalized women with 8000 deaths. \n \n If you see a baby, you see the evidence that a mother cared enough to take care of herself and carry it to term.

Meaning that clearly Jesus was talking about a small needle.\n\n [/quote]\n I am naturally suspicious of people that quote someone elese's work word for word but don't ascribe authorship to it, leaving people to ASSume that it was an original thought. Here's the real author of the above.\n http://www.biblicalhebrew.com/nt/camelneedle.htm\n \n Now, adding to the disengenuous nature of the post, it continues on to show how a rich man CAN attain Heaven.\n \n\n Makes sense in Aramaic\n An alternative linguistic explanation is taken from George M Lamsa's Syriac-Aramaic Peshitta translation2 which has the word 'rope' in the main text but a footnote on Matthew 19:24 which states that the Aramaic word gamla means rope and camel, possibly because the ropes were made from camel hair. Evidence for this also comes from the 10th century Aramaic lexicographer Mar Bahlul who gives the meaning as a \"a large rope used to bind ships\". (cf. http://www.aramaicnt.org/HTML/LUKE/evidences/Camel.html)\n \n Some have even suggested a pun in Aramaic between camel and gnat or louse from the Aramaic kalma 'vermin, louse'.\n \n Just as the apocryphal Acts of Peter and Andrew3 refers the saying to a literal camel and needle, so we are not meant to reason away the apparent difficulty of getting a camel through a needle's eye. For the difficulty is not apparent it is real, and not be solved by textual trickery but by taking the ludicrous language at face value.\n \n What we have instead then, I believe, is a beautiful Hebrew hyperbole, as in the tree sticking out of one's eye whilst one is removing a speck in another's eye! Indeed, Jewish Talmudic literature uses a similar aphorism about an elephant passing through the eye of a needle as a figure of speech implying the unlikely or impossible:\n \n \"They do not show a man a palm tree of gold, nor an elephant going through the eye of a needle.\"4 \n \n This first instance concerned dreams and their interpretation and suggested that men only dream that which is natural or possible, not that which is unlikely ever to have occurred to them.\n \n \"... who can make an elephant pass through the eye of a needle.\"5 \n \n In this case, the illustration concerns a dispute between two rabbis, one of whom suggests that the other is speaking \"things which are impossible\".\n \n The camel was the largest animal seen regularly in Israel, whereas in regions where the Babylonian Talmud was written, the elephant was the biggest animal. Thus the aphorism is culturally translated from a camel to an elephant in regions outside of Israel.\n \n The aim is not, then, to explain away the paradox and make the needle a huge carpet needle for, elsewhere, the Jewish writings use the \"eye of the needle\" as a picture of a very small place, \"A needle's eye is not too narrow for two friends, but the world is not wide enough for two enemies.\"6 . The ludicrous contrast between the small size of the needle's eye and the largest indigenous animal is to be preserved for its very improbability.\n \n Jesus' hearers believed that wealth and prosperity were a sign of God's blessing (cf. Leviticus and Deuteronomy). So their incredulity is more along the lines that, \"if the rich, who must be seen as righteous by God by dint of their evident blessing, can't be saved, who can be?\". Later Christians have turned this around to portray wealth as a hindrance to salvation, which it can be - but no more so than many other things, when the message is that salvation is impossible for all men for it comes from God alone.\n \n But beyond impossibility is possibility with God for, elsewhere, a Jewish midrash records:\n \n \"The Holy One said, open for me a door as big as a needle's eye and I will open for you a door through which may enter tents and [camels?]\"7\n \n In other words God only needs the sinner to open up just a crack for him and God will come pouring in and set up room for an oasis. God only needs a 'foot in the door', so to speak.\n \n This is similar to the Talmudic use of two Hebrew letters, one which represents God holiness ('Q' Qoph, as in qad\u00f4sh 'holy') and another representing evil ('R' Resh, as in ra' 'evil'), in a story told for the purpose of teaching the Hebrew alphabet and Jewish morals. It is said that 'q' has a separated opening in order that should 'r' repent he may enter into God's holiness through the small opening.\n \n A brief survey of sermons or search on the Internet reveals how many perpetuate the myth of the small gate in Jerusalem. Victorian travellers to the Holy Land even claim to have been shown it. The inaccuracy may appear harmless but it is neither good scholarship nor good exposition. The exaggerated and contrasted size is deliberate and is not an overt judgement on riches or poverty. Jesus reflects on how hard it often is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God. The riches are a distraction and hard to share if one is too attached to them. The disciples' incredulity is that if even the rich cannot be saved, who can? But the verdict is that even the rich, not only the rich, will find it impossible to save themselves - but with God all things are possible.\n http://www.biblicalhebrew.com/nt/camelneedle.htm\n \n",

Children are killed for punishment. Women are killed for simply looking the wrong direction (turned to salt). God has ordered the deaths all family members and cities of peoples many times.\n \n In reality; Human life is momentary. All living organisms die, and you will die. There is no way to prevent a person from dieing. \n \n The question is what makes a being, thats the real question. Your bones will be replaced cell for cell four times. Your skin is in constant death throws. Sperm, eggs, blood cells give up life and have no function or reason for being more than not. \n \n Your personality has a lot to do with the chemistry of your brain, and a drug can alter your aggression level, conscientiousness and mood. \n \n The question can never be the value of life, because no life is saved. All life is doomed and this allows many religions to toy with life after death concepts. Logically if life is after death, then the question of taking life would never even be raised. One could not take life. \n \n All religions understand life is lost and in placing value on life, seek to preserve their own. No one joins a religion to lose their lives, they seek to preserve it. \n \n All faiths provide promises of a better and longer life with the sacrifice of living out their current lives in worship and ceremony. I would ask a religious person if they have considered the real value of the current life they lead? Is it reasonable to sacrifice treasure and time to a faith when that time could have been used for the benefit of their offspring? Its a reasonable question.\n \n To argue life can be taken is to understand life is fragile and easily disturbed. The higher the value placed on life requires the understanding that life indeed ends. The Wright brothers plane will still fly, its just over 100 years old (very young considering its the first) and no human can match that longevity. Humans live on average 80 years. Very short period of time for life and with that knowledge its value is limited because it can't be kept. Sparks are pretty and have value simply from producing light though they last a very short period of time. You will not last much longer as I will not. 80 is a very small number. \n \n All peoples place value on beings. When we determine life has lost its ability to be called a being; I.E. brain dead, we lose the desire to preserve it unless we find value is using for the benefit of beings. We use parts of whole humans for other humans. We do this when a human has lost its being.\n \n Man places higher values on higher levels of conscientiousness. A dolphin has a higher value to us that an ant. We tend to eat cows because they have very small minds and are unaware of loss even when a sibling's life is taken right in front of them.\n \n Nature allows and has mechanisms for abortion. Women have to care for them selfs or these mechanisms will undermine the gestation process. Clearly if there is God the mechanisms for abortion are authored there.",

All life is doomed and this allows many religions to toy with life after death concepts. Logically if life is after death, then the question of taking life would never even be raised. One could not take life. \n\n \n I disagree. If the question was \"what makes us a being\" then logically, brain dead people, those who cannot communicate, and people with various other disorders would make them life unworthy of life. \n \n For instance, a feral child is not a human as it cannot communicate or feel empathy for other humans.\n A brain dead person is not a human as it cannot think or communicate.\n A fetus is not a human as it is incapable of doing any of the above.\n \n The question to be asked is \"What is the value of human life?\" \n A fetus serves the greatest purpose of all. Regardless of whether it is life or not, it has the potential to become a living, conscious being. new flesh and blood. \n \n\n To argue life can be taken is to understand life is fragile and easily disturbed.

Yes, every organism dies, but is that a justification for killing? \"It's going to die anyways in fifty years or so, let's kill it now.\" Doesn't sound like it constitutes a valid argument, Imho. \n \n\n All peoples place value on beings. When we determine life has lost its ability to be called a being; I.E. brain dead, we lose the desire to preserve it unless we find value is using for the benefit of beings. We use parts of whole humans for other humans. We do this when a human has lost its being.\n \n Man places higher values on higher levels of conscientiousness. A dolphin has a higher value to us that an ant. We tend to eat cows because they have very small minds and are unaware of loss even when a sibling's life is taken right in front of them.\n\n Very true, but that value is entirely subjective. A lot of people eat cows and not cats and dogs because of the utility of doing so, despite cows and dogs being nearly identical cognitively. Can you substantiate your claim that a cow will be unaware of their calf's life is taken right in from of them? \n \n Cows are not stupid animals and even if they were, the intelligence of the animal should not matter. It is still a living, conscious being. \n \n\n Nature allows and has mechanisms for abortion. Women have to care for them selfs or these mechanisms will undermine the gestation process. Clearly if there is God the mechanisms for abortion are authored there.\n\n I have read briefly about natural abortion processes such as miscarriage. I'm not saying that abortion is wrong because it is done unnaturally, but that it is wrong because of the value of life inside the woman.",

   "I understand why you included statements of God and religions in your paragraphs, that is afterall what this thread is about, but I'm not going to respond to them because I honestly couldn't care less what orthodox religions have to say on the matter of abortion. \n \n \n I disagree. If the question was \"what makes us a being\" then logically, brain dead people, those who cannot communicate, and people with various other disorders would make them life unworthy of life. \n \n For instance, a feral child is not a human as it cannot communicate or feel empathy for other humans.\n A brain dead person is not a human as it cannot think or communicate.\n A fetus is not a human as it is incapable of doing any of the above.\n \n The question to be asked is \"What is the value of human life?\" \n A fetus serves the greatest purpose of all. Regardless of whether it is life or not, it has the potential to become a living, conscious being. new flesh and blood. \n I don't understand the relevance of life-span and death of humans in this discussion.

I think what we're seeking is an experience of being alive, so that our life experiences on the purely physical plane will have resonances within our own innermost being and reality, so that we actually feel the rapture of being alive.\n \n \n Why should anyone listen to the Gibranlike bleatings of that anti-Semite?;)",

Your believes should call you into action today tdkocher, your female family members can save these lives right now. All they have to do is gestate them. Let the embros gestate in their bodies and go to term. By your own moral code, if you don't, your allowing their deaths because its very clear your females can save them today. Don't you dare ask them or give them a choice tdocher, you force them by your moral law.\n \n Prove to me and the world they are living humans tdocher. You can do that very simply by saving what you can. You can save a boat load of them by simply using all your females over and over again. If you don't do this your a lier or the lifes of these embros has no meaning to any of your females.\n \n I am very interested in how many you save.

I believe that you shouldn't die just because you were concived during rape. Because someone decided to give there egg up dosen't mean that someone else should have to bear the child.
