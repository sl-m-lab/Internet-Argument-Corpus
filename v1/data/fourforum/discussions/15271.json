Chimps that kill an infant chimp are torn apart by their troop. I would argue that the harsh punishment is due to the fact that the group considers that more than a sin. They view it as actually evil and respond harshly. \n \n Our own (human) history supports this. Just like definitions of morality and sin have shifted over the years, so have definitions of evil. Jefferson kept slaves and routinely raped at least one...impregnating her 6 times...then sold the offspring. \n \n Today if you kept a sex slave and sold off your half children that were the result of your serial rape, most people would say you are EVIL. Then it was just part of life. \n \n Whether all sinners are evil is a subjective judgement because \"evil\" is a subjective term.",

   "Jesus told people that unless they believed he was who he claimed to be (God and the Messiah) that they would indeed die in their sins (John 8:24). I don't think the meaning of that was lost on very many. And in my book, that's as good as telling people they're going to hell if they don't repent and believe in him.\n\n \n So, jesus standing up in front of a group of people and saying \"Believe in me or you will die in your sins\" is the same as you saying to an individual \"REPENT for having gay sex or YOU WILL BURN IN HELL\".\n \n If that is the same \"in your book\", you need to get a new book because the one you are reading is just plain stupid...and dont come back and claim it is the bible because NOWHERE in the bible does jesus tell an individual they are going to hell and NOWHERE in the bible does he in ANY WAY instruct his followers to do so. \n \n What you miss in your prideful ignorance, which reminds me you have one HELL of a lot of repenting to do starting with apologies to about 20 people here because your posts are just DRIPPING with sinful pride, but what you MISS is that what you preach here is exactly the OPPOSITE of what jesus preached. What jesus preached, and what made his message revolutionary at the time, was that god is not a petty, wrathful god. He is a god of infinite love, compassion, and mercy. THAT is why you are supposed to go to god...because he loves you. Because he is the only guy out there who, no matter what you have done, offers you mercy and compassion. \n \n THAT is why you are supposed to repent your sins....not because you fear hell. If you repent because you fear hell, it is going to get you nowhere. God is not a cosmic vending machine where you insert 50 repentant credits and he kicks out a salvation bar. \n \n If you actually care about what jesus taught outside of hating gay people, you should recognize that repentance was not the goal. It was a step along the way to a relationship with god. You were supposed to repent your sins to god because you love him and the idea that you have done something displeasing to him and it tears at your conscience. \n \n Jesus said that you should love god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind. Nobody is going to love god like that if the person trying to explain god portrays him as some kind of dick who is just waiting to toss you into a fiery pit the minute you step out of line, and you have to perform silly tasks to make him happy again. Nobody is going to love a god like that, Easy, because he is obviously a freaking psychopath. He would be no better than a mugger who puts a gun to your head, steals your wallet, and makes you do jumping jacks to amuse himself. Sure, you would do it, but not because you love the mugger, you would do it because he is a nut job with a gun. \n \n You were warned specifically against this in the bible. Do not judge others and you will not be judged....specks of sawdust and plank in eyes and all that. At the same time, we are warned to beware of evildoers and false prophets, which obviously requires that we judge the actions of others. \n \n The strange thing is that the first one...about judging others....is from Matthew (IIRC Matthew 7). Also in Matthew 7, not too far down, is where he warns about false prophets and evildoers, and says that you can identify these people by their actions just like you can identify a tree by its fruit. \n \n Between those 2 is the whole sawdust and plank thing. Now, there are some christians that claim that the sawdust and plank thing is strictly a prohibition against judging people hypocritically. The problem with this is that according to jesus we are ALL sinners and are ALL in need of gods love and mercy ALL the time, so we are ALL walking around with planks in our eyes. \n \n So is jesus retarded?? Is that really your explanation, Easy? That jesus was so mentally retarded that he could not keep a train of thought long enough for matthew to write even one page that was full of contradiction? \n \n What jesus is saying in matthew, and a point he makes throughout the new testament, is that we should look at the actions and beliefs of others...judge them...in deciding who we associate with and who we take guidance from. At the same time, we are supposed to KEEP THOSE JUDGEMENTS TO OURSELVES. \n \n Nobody has EVER been brought to the lord because somebody told them that god was a psychopath who is just waiting for the chance to toss them into a lake of fire. You cannot annoy somebody into a relationship with god by harping on them about how sinful they are. \n \n Repentance or worship based on fear is nothing but theater. That may be good enough for you. It is nowhere near good enough for god. \n \n You come here and preach damnation and drive people away from god because of pride. Because you arrogantly and pridefully believe that YOU know the mind of god. All the while what you preach is in direct contradiction to the word and teaching of jesus christ. \n \n Not a day goes by without you demanding that somebody to repent their sins to avoid the fires of hell. I call on YOU to repent. There is no greater sin than driving people away from the love and mercy of god and you have done it in thousands of posts here to hundreds of people. There is NOBODY here who has confessed a bigger sin than you commit every time you post your ignorant, satan inspired GARBAGE. \n \n \n\n \"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles?' Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!\"\n\n \n He is talking about you, Easy, and those like you. \n \n I know you will probably answer this with 20 out of context bible quotes with no logic stringing them together, so I will go ahead and respond to your next post right here by saying even the devil can quote scripture to his own end.",

   "So, jesus standing up in front of a group of people and saying \"Believe in me or you will die in your sins\" is the same as you saying to an individual \"REPENT for having gay sex or YOU WILL BURN IN HELL\".\n \n If that is the same \"in your book\", you need to get a new book because the one you are reading is just plain stupid...and dont come back and claim it is the bible because NOWHERE in the bible does jesus tell an individual they are going to hell and NOWHERE in the bible does he in ANY WAY instruct his followers to do so. \n\n \n Go sell your manure on down the road.

But if you do warn the wicked person to turn from their ways and they do not do so, they will die for their sin, though you yourself will be saved. \n \n How's that for infinite love? Your fairy tale of \"God won't ever send anyone to Hell\" is a doctrine of Satan himself. So I'm not surprised it's coming from you.\n \n \n\n Nobody is going to love god like that if the person trying to explain god portrays him as some kind of dick who is just waiting to toss you into a fiery pit the minute you step out of line, and you have to perform silly tasks to make him happy again.

I've got news for you, Easy, the god of the old testament was a petty, wrathful, cruel god. He was almost unrecognizable from the God portrayed by jesus. That was kind of the point of sending Jesus, easy, and what all that \"Nobody comes to the father but through me\" thing was. He said on several occasions that HIS teachings were the ones that were important. He came to earth to bring us a new understanding of God. If the old testament was \"good enough\" he would not really have needed to come and spend a bunch of time walking around in the freaking desert preaching. He came to straighten us out. \n \n If you see the old testament as the over riding authority here, you need to quit claiming to be a christian and just go ahead and convert to Judaism. Then you can surround yourself with people who think like you. If you are a christian, the words of jesus are pretty much the ultimate authority.\n \n This is an interesting, but slimy, dodge. Who is likely to be the better authority on what god wants.....Jesus, who you point out IS god....or Ezekiel?

Wise up.\n\n \n \n Yes. I get it. You STILL have not managed to find even ONE PLACE in the bible where Jesus points at somebody and tells them that they are going to hell. There are plenty of places where he says \"DONT DO THAT\", and he obviously did not do it himself. \n \n I would suggest that YOU wise up and do it quickly, because if I was making a list of folks here who are likely to burn in the pit, you would be number 1 on that list. \n \n While you obviously have a disturbing and unnatural preoccupation with homosexual sex...particularly gay sex....most people do not. Jesus obviously did not spend nearly as much time thinking about gay sex as you. He never, ever, in the entire bible, says a single word about it. NOT ONCE. And he probably had a LOT more contact with it than you do. He was wandering around where there were a bunch of Romans, and these were not the early republic Romans who put people do death for homosexuality....nor are they the late republic Romans (3rd century) who decided to really start pushing morals. These were the decadent Romans...the ones who held orgies and did not have a separate term for homosexual sex, it was just sex. Boy slave taken by the Roman Legions during that time were passed around as whores, and it had not been that long since the romans rolled into the region.\n \n So, Jesus was XXX deep in homosexuality. It was common among the Romans...the folks who ran things...and there were romans all over the place. And he never bothered to say even one word about it. The romans at the time pretty much classed it with beating off. Cheating on your wife with another woman was considered a bad thing to do, but with a man was pretty much like getting caught stroking your willy. \n \n Obviously he did not consider it to be one of the more pressing matters out there. Yes...homosexual sex is probably a sin....just like premarital sex. It is not an especially heinous sin or Jesus would have talked about it at least a little. \n \n Unless you jump back to leviticus, there is really nothing in the bible to indicate that homosexual sex is anything more than a garden variety sin. Of course if we jump back to leviticus and you shave, eat shellfish, wear clothes made out of 2 different kinds of thread, or eat your meat medium rare, you are just as much a sinner as the gayest guy you can find. Lets just agree that leviticus is full of a bunch of silly XXXX that we dont want to bring back and leave it at that.\n \n Please....please....quote paul now so I can can go a little further in demonstrating how ignorant you are about the religion you claim to adhere to and the god you think you follow.",

And the Bible says unless people repent of their sins and receive Christ as their Lord and Savior for the remission of their sins, then they're lost.\n \n As for God being a supposed meanie in the OT, did you miss the Judgments by Jesus in the Book of Revelation? Same God, more Judgments. Liberals can't stand to be held accountable, so they always try to make God out to be the bad guy. So beware, sport, what you're telling people.\n \n John 8:24",

   "Jesus and Hell\n \n In many of His parables Jesus speaks of the judgment of fire.\n \n In explaining the meaning of the parable of the weeds among the grain, Jesus says: \"The enemy who sowed them is the devil, the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are the angels. Therefore as the tares are gathered and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of this age. The Son of Man will send out His angels, and they will gather out of His kingdom all things that offend, and those who practice lawlessness, and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth\" (Matthew 13:39-42).\n \n Notice that according to the teaching of Jesus there are just two possibilities. Either one is saved and inherits the kingdom of heaven, or one goes to eternal punishment.\n \n In the parable of the dragnet, the fishermen would simply throw the bad fish away, but when Jesus explains the meaning, this is intensified to eternal punishment: \"So it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come forth, separate the wicked from among the just, and cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth\" (Matthew 13:47-50).\n \n In the parable of the wedding guests, even though one man had been admitted into the banquet hall by the grace of the king, because he had failed to wear a wedding garment, he was thrown out. The description of his punishment switches from the parable to a description of the judgment of the wicked: \"Then the king said to the servants, 'Bind him hand and foot, take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.' For many are called, but few are chosen\" (Matthew 22:11-14).\n \n We can understand why the scribes and Pharisees wanted to kill Jesus, when we read the \"woes\" that He pronounces over them. They refuse to enter the kingdom, and prevent others from entering. They devour widows' houses while saying long hypocritical prayers. They travel land and sea to make a proselyte whom they then make twice as much a son of hell as they are! He calls them \"Blind fools\" because of their silly excuses for not obeying the law. He says they observe all kinds of details but neglect \"justice and mercy and faith.\" They are full of \"extortion and self- indulgence.\" They are like whitewashed tombs, full of rottenness on the inside. After these scathing denouncements, He is not unclear about their destiny. \"Serpents, brood of vipers! How can you escape the condemnation of hell?\" (Matthew 23:13-33).\n \n People to whom responsibility is entrusted by God are punished if they are unfaithful or unprofitable. Of the evil servant who gets drunk and beats his fellow servants it is said: \"The master of that servant will come on a day when he is not looking for him and at an hour that he is not aware of, and will cut him in two and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth\" (Matthew 24:48-51). Of the man who buried his talent in the ground, it is said: \"And cast the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth\" (Matthew 25:30).\n \n After the above two parables, Jesus tells of the separation of the \"sheep\" from the \"goats\" on the day of judgment. Again there are only two possibilities. The reward is great and the punishment is severe. \"Then He will also say to those on the left hand, 'Depart from Me, you cursed, into the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels'\" (Matthew 25:41). \"And these will go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into eternal life\" (Matthew 25:46).\n \n Many want to believe that most people will be saved, except for those who are 'really bad'. Some have even deluded themselves into thinking that everyone will be saved. Jesus teaches that most people will be lost.\n \n \"Then one said to Him, 'Lord, are there few who are saved?' And He said to them, 'Strive to enter through the narrow gate, for many, I say to you, will seek to enter and will not be able\" (Luke 13:23,24). To those who have not entered when the Master has shut the door, the message will be: \"Depart from Me, all you workers of iniquity.\" \"There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and yourselves thrust out\" (Luke 13:25-28).\n \n The punishment suffered by the wicked after this life is graphically described in the account of the rich man and Lazarus.\n \n \"So it was that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels to Abraham's bosom. The rich man also died and was buried. And being in torments in Hades, he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. Then he cried and said, 'Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.' But Abraham said, 'Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things; but now he is comforted and you are tormented'\" (Luke 16:22-25).\n \n When the rich man realized that there was no way his own suffering could be diminished, he expressed his concern for his brothers who were evidently headed for the same judgment: \"Then he said, 'I beg you therefore, father, that you would send him to my father's house, for I have five brothers, that he may testify to them, lest they also come to this place of torment'\" (Luke 16:27,28).\n \n Reference to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah is also made in Jude: \"...as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities around them in a similar manner to these, having given themselves over to sexual immorality and gone after strange flesh, are set forth as an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire\" (Jude 7). Notice that although the physical cities were destroyed never to be rebuilt, the residents continue to suffer the vengeance of eternal fire.\n In the Revelation we are warned that those who serve the devil and his comrades will also share in their eternal punishment.\n \n \"Then a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, 'If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives his mark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His indignation. And he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; and they have no rest day or night, who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name'\" (Revelation 14:9-11).\n \"Then the beast was captured, and with him the false prophet who worked signs in his presence, by which he deceived those who received the mark of the beast and those who worshipped his image. These two were cast alive into the lake of fire burning with brimstone\" (Revelation 19:20).\n \n \"And the devil, who deceived them, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are. And they will be tormented day and night forever and ever\" (Revelation 20:10).\n \n \"The sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hades delivered up the dead who were in them. And they were judged, each one according to his works. Then Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And anyone not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire\" (Revelation 20:13-15).\n \n Eternal Punishment in Hell",

You alienate those that don't which leaves you with those that do. \n \n Notice how anyone commenting on your posts did so with regards to how you were coming off.

I am also pretty sure that those who do spew forth such nonsense generally get the same treatment.\n \n I look forward to having an intelligent discussion with you at some point that is based on facts more than speculation.\n \n Also the woman who cuts my hair prefers to be called a hair stylist which out of respect for her I do the same.",

   "So which is it, and who is going to Hell?\n \n Is Hitler going to heaven?\n \n See my next post for more on Jesus and Hell.\n \n\n \n If hitler accepted jesus and repented his sins then YES, he is in heaven. Granted he would have to have done it very close to the end of his life (since he continued to sin, meaning there was no real repentance), but if in those final hours he did accept christ and repent, he is in heaven. IF not, you will be room mates with him in the burning lake when you die. \n \n \n \nHe did.\n \n Jesus is God (many scriptures). As God, Jesus is the one who gave Moses the Levitical law against gay sex to begin with; and he's the one who inspires all Scripture (2 Timothy 3:16), including prohibitions against gay sex in Romans 1:26-27 and I Corinthians 6:9-10, etc. \n\n \n Jesus specifically preached that the law or moses (in leviticus) was WRONG. That is why Christians dont just assume that anybody who tosses back an oyster or shaves is going to burn in hell. That is why christians do not have to avoid cotton/polyester blended T shirts. It is because when asked about the old \"laws of moses\" he pretty much came back screaming \"BULLHOCKEY\". \n \n \n \n Frankly your answer here is a pathetic dodge. In all his years of teaching JESUS NEVER TOOK UP THE ISSUE OF HOMOSEXUALITY. You have to jump to the \"well....these people did, and the scriptures were inspired by god....\" BS. And it IS BS. We know for an absolute FACT that a lot of the scripture was written long after jesus was dead. We know that parts of it were CHANGED for political purposes. We know that, in fact, the books of the bible as we know it today were specifically CHOSEN for political purposes. \n \n Knowing that all of that is absolutely, without doubt TRUE, you expect us to take somebody elses word for what jesus thought?? Are you INSANE?? \n \n Frankly the passages you quote support my position on this. First, the one in Romans....well....we can more or less disregard the one in Romans because in context it means something completely different. When Paul wrote to the Romans, he did so in response to a greek practice that was starting to catch on in rome. The greeks would go to church (yes...christian churches) but with a twist. At the end of the service, they would have a good old fashioned, no holds barred orgy fueled by religious fervor. When I say no holds barred, I mean NO HOLDS BARRED. Incest, gay sex, beastiality. It was all there. This was starting to catch on in Rome, and the entire point of Pauls letter was to tell them to NO hold perverted orgies at the end of their church services. \n \n That is why I Corinthians contains so much about sexual morality. BUT....it does not say that homosexual sex is any kind of special or particularly grievous sin. It literally lists it along with all sexual immorality, and lists it right before being a drunkard when it comes to who will not be inheriting the kingdom of heaven. \n \n \n\n At least you admit gay sex is a sin. The Bible says the wages of sin is death. And if you've broken one point in the law you've broken the entire law. And the Bible says unless people repent of their sins and receive Christ as their Lord and Savior for the remission of their sins, then they're lost.\n\n \n All premarital sex is a sin. Gay sex is nothing special...no better or worse than having sex with a woman you are not married to...and no better or worse than being a drunkard, according to I Corinthians. \n \n That is why I find your unnatural preoccupation with it to be so bizarre and unhealthy. You clearly have some issues to work through. \n \n \nAs for God being a supposed meanie in the OT, did you miss the Judgments by Jesus in the Book of Revelation? Same God, more Judgments. Liberals can't stand to be held accountable, so they always try to make God out to be the bad guy. So beware, sport, what you're telling people.\n\n \n ROTFLMAO. This is just plain pathetic, easy. \n \n As far as your next post, I am not going to waste time responding to something you just cut and pasted off another site...especially since it does not counter anything I have said AT ALL. \n \n I know jesus talked about hell. He described it rather vividly. I have not suggested that he did not.\n \n What I said, as you FULL WELL KNOW and are dishonestly trying to avoid having to deal with, is that nowhere did jesus EVER point at an individual and tell them that they are going to hell. Even surrounded with prostitutes and thieves, he did not do it. He went out of his way to tell us NOT TO DO THAT. He explained WHY WE SHOULD NOT DO THAT. And you continually DO IT. \n \n This is not hard to understand, Easy. I have laid it out as simply and as logically as I possibly can. Nobody else seems to have trouble understanding it. Why it is so hard for you??",

You don't know me (except by the few postings here....so, in other words, \"you don't know me\"). I have no problem with intelligent, respectful, reasonable people, be they white, green or polka-dotted. My many white friends and relations will attest to that. For you to be so narrow-minded as to think that, me, bucking the status quo, and not \"rolling over\" at the slightest suggestion of outrage from your \"camp\", is a sign that I have zero tolerance for all white people is beyond the pale. Nothing is ever cut and dried, black or white, or absolute. It's so much easier for you to succumb to your stereotype of who you think I am, than it would be to exercise your brain cells and employ your synapses to \"think\".

Something that is flat out said to be an abomination before god??\n \n \n\n Gay sex is identified as a sin in both Testaments. And these directives come from God, as I documented in a previous post.\n\n \n So...no quote from Jesus. Gotcha. You are relying ENTIRELY on second hand material for this. \n \n \nWell, go tell it to the heathens, because I'm not buying it. \n\n \n Not something you can buy or not buy. It is just the facts. There are not 2 different versions to consider...that is just the way it is. \n \n \n \n \nMake you a deal, sport. You and your gay friends shut up about it and never mention it again and so will I. Deal? Put your money where your mouths are. We don't need to be reminded about which way people perform sex.\n\n \n You are ALWAYS the one to bring it up, Easy. There has not been a single thread started here about gay sex. For Christs sake, the other day somebody posted a thread about gay children killing themselves and you immediately jump to \"They are going to burn in a lake of fire if they dont repent for having gay sex\". Back in the real world, these were CHILDREN...they were just figuring out they were gay. The odds are VERY, VERY good that they were virgins. The article said nothing about gay sex. Nobody else brought it up. You just immediately jump from dead children to gay sex all by yourself. \n \n You pollute virtually every thread with this idiocy, Easy. You hear \"gay\" and immediately start fantasizing about gay men pounding away on each other. Arguing about gay rights has NOTHING to do with gay sex...they have the right to have gay sex already. That is settled. It is the OTHER rights that people are actually interested in...and the OTHER rights that people actually debate. No matter what the topic, though, gay rights, gays in the military, gays giving blood, you immediately want to jump to an in depth conversation about gay sex and what God thinks about it. \n \n Put my money where my mouth is? I have NEVER ONCE brought up the issue of gay sex. NEVER. \n \n You spend more time thinking about gay sex than anybody I have ever known, with the possible exception of Fred Phelps. You spend more time thinking about and talking about gay sex than I spend thinking about straight sex. \n \n I would just as soon not discuss sex AT ALL here. You just cant seem to keep from interjecting it into and making it the center of every topic. \n \n \nThis is a dumb straw man on your part. We know Hell exists - you admit Jesus taught about it, and we know people are going there, so are you trying to say he won't cast anyone into it? He called Judas a 'son of perdition,' strongly inferring Judas is going to the Pit, and we know Jesus is the one who will Judge him and send him there. Besides, he may well have told someone they're going to Hell, but no one wrote about it. Yours is an argument from silence. Get a new dog. That one has fleas.\n\n \n No, this is a dumb strawman on YOUR part. The entire topic here was the fact that jesus never once told an individual that they were going to hell, and told us NOT to do it, either. You do it repeatedly, and in doing so drive people away from Jesus Christ, which is a MUCH greater sin than anything the alleged sinners you are commenting to have committed. \n \n The idea that I am trying to sell a \"nobody goes to hell\" theory is just a bit of stupidity that you have come up with to get around the fact that you have no defense whatsoever against my charges here. The FACT is that you continually engage in behavior that jesus told us specifically NOT to engage in. The FACT is that in his entire life, he never engaged in that behavior. The FACT is that you are guilty of both the sin of pride, and you are guilty of driving people away from god, which is perhaps the greatest sin of all. That literally puts you in with Satan himself. \n \n Those are the facts, easy. That is why even other Christians here do not associate with you. That is why I dont debate you more often. Jesus warned us about false prophets, evildoers, and those trees that bear bad fruit. He is talking about YOU, easy, and his advice was to AVOID THEM.\n \n Whoever you CLAIM to be worshiping, when you are doing Satans work, you are serving satan, and that is who you are worshiping. The fact that you give lip service to god and then go out and serve satan does not make you a child of god. It makes you a deceiver. I would bet you can probably dig up some good bible verses on deceivers.",

There is nothing AT ALL anywhere in the bible to suggest that homosexuality is a sin. It says that homosexual sex is a sin (probably). Even Easy seems to understand the difference between the 2. He does not call on people to repent for being gay, he calls on them to repent for gay sex. He differentiates between the 2 in this thread:\n \n \nGay sex is identified as a sin in both Testaments. And these directives come from God, as I documented in a previous post.\n\n \n That is Easy just a few posts back. Obviously he understands and differentiates between homosexuality in general and gay sex. \n \n In all my time here I have seen ONE thread that was actually about gay sex. ONE. I have been posting here for years. That thread was deleted....myself and Steeeve reported it because it was explicate and inappropriate. \n \n So we have Easy CONSTANTLY interjecting the subject of gay sex into threads that have nothing at all to do with gay sex. If he wants to start a thread entitled \"Gay sex is a sin\" he can do so. If he wants to have conversations about gay sex, he can start threads about it. Constantly interjecting his opinion on gay sex into threads that have NOTHING AT ALL to do with gay sex is disruptive and off topic.\n \n Dont say he is a christian, though. A christian is somebody who follows the teachings of christ, and I think it has been shown quite clearly that easy does NOT. He instead goes directly against the teachings of christ.

So there can be no conclusion as to whether homosexual acts are all outside of marriage, and therefore immoral. This is where your argument fails.\n \n However, if we continue with your argument (which I fully understand, and this is why I recognise that it is flawed), and somehow conclude that homosexual acts are immoral because they are sex outside of marriage (the crux of your argument), we must also conclude that other acts of sex outside of marriage are also immoral.\n \n You may feel that other immoral acts that occur in the bible are irrelevant, but if those acts are committed by characters in the bible that are highly thought of by your god, this brings into question the character of your god, and thus the validity of his morality.\n\n \n If the bible recognises homosexuality and condemns homosexual sex in a few verses then makes no provision that homosexuals can marry then we can conclude that God does not recognise gay marriage.\n The fact that you think this a 'flawed argument' does not make it one.\n \n Yes some characters in the Bible do commit immoral acts but the character of 'my' God and the validity of his morality is not being discussed..by me anyway.",

King David had a Gay lover , Jonathan, the son of Saul. It's mentioned in the Bible. Noah's own son supposedly raped his father while he was passed out drunk, and in Leviticus it does say that Laying with a man as if a woman is an abomination. \n Jesus however never condemned homosexuality. In fact there are some scholars who believe that Jesus was himself Gay. Paul condemns Homosexuals in the new testament, and he is also the only one to mention Lesbian sex as well.

I'm speaking from a pure humanist point of view and taking God and Jesus out of the Equation denying Gay people their rights is wrong. \n \n I personally don't believe God exists.. so When someone brings up the Bible as if I am expected to follow some ancient man made Drivel then I am forced to speak up .

Ignore common sense.\n \n Theology 101 Webinar - Xcaliber on Shellfish\n \n emoticon_xbouncer\n\n \n Leviticus was for the Jews in antiquity. It doesn't apply to Christians, now does it? Duh. \n Steps To Recovery From Bible Abuse\n \n Leviticus was written to Old Testament Jews, NOT to New Testament Christians.\n \n That's Crystal Clear! According To The Bible, Leviticus Is Written To Israel\n Not To Christians\n \n \n \n \n Leviticus is written specifically for the children of Israel, containing laws and rules for Israel to obey as they prepare to occupy the land of Canaan.\n \n \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Moses with the Ten Commandments.\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Does God tell us, in the Bible, to whom the laws in Leviticus apply? \n \n Yes, God states precisely, to whom Leviticus and the Law applied. Moses writes under inspiration, II Timothy 3:16-17. \n \n \n \"The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us, [the Jewish nation] who are all of us here alive this day.\" Deu 5:3.\n \n \"This day\" was around 1450 BC, when Moses originally wrote the Law that God gave him on Mt. Sinai for the nation of Israel. \n \n \n Notice Two Important Things\n \n First, the law of Moses did not apply to anyone before God gave it to Moses. \n \n Read Deuteronomy 5:3 again and let it sink into your heart. Adam and Eve, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were not under the law of Moses. \n \n Second, God made His covenant of law, as given in Leviticus, in approximately 1450 BC, with Moses and the Jewish people who were getting ready to possess the land of Canaan, what we today call Israel.\n \n \n The Holiness Code was not given to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. They lived hundreds of years before Moses.\n \n The Holiness Code was not made with everyone living on earth. It was a specific covenant with a specific people, the Jews, at a specific time in history, for specific purposes related to the specific situation in Palestine at that time.\n \n \n \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n The Molech idol, where pagans sacrificed their children to a false god.\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n The Holiness Code of Leviticus did not apply to anyone anywhere, until God gave it to Moses, for Israel to obey, in the land of Israel, Deuteronomy 4:5, 14, 5:31, 6:1. \n \n Throughout Leviticus, Moses is speaking to the children of Israel, giving instructions for living in the land, under the Law. Moses is not setting down rules and regulations for Christians, in the twenty first century. The Holiness Code was intended to outlaw the pagan practices of fertility goddess cults in ancient Canaan.\n \n \n It is important to distinguish between Jews and Christians as we interpret the Bible. \n \n Christians do not show up in scripture until Acts 11:26, some fifteen hundred years after the Holiness Code was given.\n \n Some of the Bible is written to Jews but not written to Christians. For example, we have demonstrated above, that Leviticus is written to Jews (the children of Israel). \n \n The New Testament never instructs us that Christians must live under Jewish Law or that Christians must observe Jewish rituals practiced by Old Testament Jews.\n \n \n The Law Of Moses went out of force when Jesus died on the Cross.\n \n \n \n \n If you don't understand that, you'll have difficulty understanding law and grace.\n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Jesus on the Cross\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n God, through Moses, addressed Himself to a particular people in a particular cultural situation at a particular time in history for a particular purpose under particular Jewish Laws which went out of force the moment Jesus died on the Cross. \n \n \"But Jesus, again crying out loudly, breathed his last.\" Matthew 27:50. The Message. \n \n \"Like a will that takes effect when someone dies, the new covenant [the New Testament] was put into action at Jesus' death.\" Hebrews 9:16, The Message.\n \n \n \n The New Testament went into force when Jesus died on the Cross.\n The New Covenant, what we call the New Testament, went into effect when Jesus died on the Cross. The Old Covenant, what we call the Old Testament, went out of force when Jesus died on the Cross.\n \n \n \"For where a testament [covenant] is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator [the person making the covenant]. \n \n For a testament [covenant] is of force after men are dead...\" Hebrews 9:16-17.\n \n \n The Law was in effect from the time God gave it to Moses on Mt. Sinai, around 1450 BC until Jesus died on the Cross, around AD 30. \n \n When Jesus died on the Cross, even the Jews who did not believe in Him knew that something had changed because the veil of the temple, which separated the Holy of Holies, was torn from top to bottom.\n \n \n \"And behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain [torn in two pieces] from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent [were torn]. Matthew 27:51.\n \n As we noted above, Leviticus is not addressed to people who lived before the Law, Deuteronomy 5:3, and it is not addressed to people who live after the Law ended. \n \n \n This Is Easy to Understand Because The Bible Is So Clear And Specific.\n \n \n \n \n \n Matthew 11:13 tells us \"For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John [the Baptist].\"\n \n That word until is important.\n \n If I'm going on vacation and I ask you to watch my house until I get back, does that mean you have to watch my house forever or only until I get back?\n \n Well obviously, you would be watching my house only until I get back. Until indicates an ending point.\n \n Just so, when the Bible says \"For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John\" God is telling us that the Law is not in force forever. According to Jesus, the Law was only in force until John the Baptist.\n \n \n The Old Testament Law Had An Ending Point.\n \n The Law ended when the Jewish Messiah, Jesus Christ, died for the sins of the world.\n \n \n God never intended that Leviticus 18:22 & 20:13 should be applied to Christians in the twenty first century.\n \n \n \n In Leviticus 18:1-3, Moses speaks to Jews, the twelve tribes of Israel, under the Law. \n \n \n \n \n \"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, \n \n Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am the LORD your God. \n \n After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in their ordinances.\" \n \n \n \n \u0095Important Fact Number One: In Leviticus, God and Moses are not laying down laws for Christians in the twenty first century. \n \n \n \u0095Important Fact Number Two: In Leviticus, God and Moses are not laying down rules to prohibit two men who love God and each other and want to live together and serve God, from doing that.\n \n \n \u0095Important Fact Number Three: God and Moses are not laying down rules to prohibit two women who love God and each other and want to live together and serve God, from doing that.\n \n In Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13, God intends to prohibit shrine prostitution or Molech worship, that is, men having sex with men in worship of Ashtoreth, Molech's Canaanite fertility goddess consort.\n \n \n We know that by the context.\n \n Leviticus 18:3 and 18:21 set the context for Leviticus 18:22. God warns Israel against the pagan gods and pagan practices of Egypt and Canaan, specifically mentioning Molech (which includes Molech's fertility goddess consort, Ashtoreth).\n \n Leviticus 20:2-5 & 23 set the context for Leviticus 20:13. God makes the same warning against the pagan practices of Egypt and Canaan, specifically mentioning Molech. \n \n The rules God gives in Leviticus specifically target the children of Israel. They are God's rules for Israel, living under the Law, in the land of Palestine, at a particular time in history.\n \n \n 1.We know these rules do not apply universally because God never told us they apply universally. \n \n \n 2.God Himself never applied these rules universally.\n \n \n 3.God never states in the New Testament that Christians must obey the Levitical Holiness Code to be in right relationship with Him.\n \n God only applied these rules to Jews living in the land of Palestine, under the Law of Moses.\n \n \n \n Christians are commanded to study the Bible, rightly dividing the word of truth, II Timothy 2:15.\n \n \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Behold the Man!\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n \"Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.\" II Tim 2:15.\n \n \"Rightly dividing\" means to apply the scripture in its proper context. II Timothy 2:15 is God's warning that we must not take scripture out of context.\n \n All scripture is written for us but all scripture is not written to us to practice. \n \n For example, Old Testament Law required Jews to bring a ram or a lamb to the Tabernacle and give it to the priests as an offering for sin. Jesus became our passover Lamb. \n \n \n \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\" John 1:29.\n \n For even Christ our passover [Lamb] is sacrificed for us.\" I Corinthians 5:7.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n The Cross of Christ\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n \n The Cross Is The Great Dividing Point\n \n Since Jesus died on the Cross, God requires no one, including Jews, to offer blood sacrifices at the Jewish Temple because Jesus has shed His sinless blood on Calvary. The sinless blood of Jesus satisfies all the demands of God's justice and never needs to be offered again, Hebrews 10:10, 12, 14. \n \n God no longer requires us to offer a blood sacrifice or to keep the Law in order to be right with God or to get saved. God requires us to accept Jesus' blood as the offering for our sins, a transaction that took place nearly two thousand years ago.\n \n \n Scriptural Conclusions Based On What The Bible Actually Says\n \n \n 1.Christians are not under Levitical Law.\n \n \n 2.The New Testament never tells Christians they must keep the Jewish Law. The Bible says we are not required to keep the Law, Acts 15:24, 21:24-25.\n \n \n 3.The New Testament specifically tells us we are not under law but under grace, Romans 6:14.\n \n \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n The Open Bible\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Why Christians do NOT keep the Saturday Sabbath.\n \n There is no logical analogy between ancient cult prostitutes who worshiped the fertility goddess and modern homosexuals.\n \n \n \n Discover why readers LOVE our NEW Book!\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Gay Christian 101\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Click here to return to the Gay Christian 101 Home Page..\n \n The Hebrew word towebhah, which we translate as abomination never refers to homosexuality in the Bible.\n \n Our new book, Gay Christian 101 - Spiritual Self-Defense For Gay Christians, contains a wealth of information about gay Christian morality.\n \n I am saying that the Holiness Code was aimed at Israel, in a specific place, the land of Israel, in a specific time period, while Israel was in the land, living under the Law. And what some Christians wrongly interpret as a universal prohibition of all gay relationships is, in reality, a prohibition of shrine prostitution in worship of the Canaanite fertility goddess.\n \n What was a sodomite in the Bible? Was it a homosexual, as many conservative preachers insist or was a sodomite in the Bible always a shrine prostitute who worshipped the Canaanite fertility goddess? \n \n In Gay Christian 101: Spiritual Self-Defense For Gay Christians, I list 18 possible ways to interpret the Levitical Holiness Code, where it is alleged to deal with homosexuality.\n \n Family Values in the Bible are so different from Traditional family values as taught by Focus On The Family that modern Christians would totally reject the \"family values\" practiced by Abraham and Sarah, Ruth and Boaz and many of the heroes of faith in the Old Testament.\n \n Did you know that Christians are not required to keep the Old Testament Law to get saved, stay saved or to be in right relationship with God?\n \n The consistent Christian teaching for 2000 years is that we do NOT keep Torah Law.",

   "Where your argument is flawed is the fact that the Bible was not written by GOD. Many of the original scriptures were not included in the Bible. The Bible you know was arranged in a specific order by men who were building a religion they would use to control the weak and delusional. I'll forget for a moment that I don't believe God exists and speak from the view of someone who believes...\n \n According to the Religious belief and according to the BIBLE the only deity with the Power to create is \"GOD\" Satan does not have the power to create. God created us all, white, black, gay, straight... In essence he CREATED homosexuality. Also according to the delusional christian faith being Gay is not normal, so this would constitute an Imperfect human. Hmmm.. Now tell me How YOUR god can create imperfection?. \n It's impossible for a Perfect \"GOD\" to create Imperfect beings. Perfection CANNOT breed imperfection... \n \n So your entire argument is rubbish. Just because Homosexuality is not Condoned in the Bible (which was written by Homophobic men) does not mean that your imaginary GOD doesn't like it.\n\n \n Thank you so much.

The Bible is not the Final authority on all things.. the sooner you realize that the better off you will be.\n\n \n No, he really is that dense. \n I offer up the following links:\n This Site\n \n \n Excerpt:\n THE BATTLE LINES\n \n The battle lines between abusive religion and all marginalized minority people have been drawn for a long time. We have become a \"nation of sheep\" and allowed ourselves to be seduced into believing many obviously ludicrous religious teachings about God, the Bible, Jesus, and especially ourselves. Accurate information is readily available. Ignorance is no longer a valid excuse for cooperating with your own destruction by terrorism religion!\n \n My web site and book are just a small part of the vast wealth of fresh factual information offered by many web sites, writers, professional medical and legal associations, organizations, and institutions.\n \n Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transsexual people have been required by religious terrorists to dig their own spiritual graves and then like deer in the headlights stand paralyzed while they are shot to death by legalistic judgmental cannons of abusive religious warfare. Our transition from victims to combat troops has already begun.\n \n Abuse can be defined as the use of power by the strong to control and destroy the weak. We cannot allow ourselves to be made weak by submission to unrealistic illogical impractical teachings and demands of abusive religion.\n \n LEARN THE TRUTH\n \n The truth really does set you free. Knowing and believing in your own personal truth is liberating. Acting on your own truth by \"coming out\" to yourself and to others is a giant step into freedom and a transition from victim to freedom fighter. The self-defeating contradictions of \"living in the closet\" weaken all of us and make us ineffective in recognizing and defeating terrorism in the many forms that attack us.\n \n You know that there is great risk in coming out and being yourself, whoever you are. Yet greater risk looms ahead for you if you deny who you are and try to hide from yourself and the reality of who you are. Internal confusions and contradictions sap our energy make us ineffective as persons and useless as warriors in any cause, even our own survival.\n \n WAR TERMINOLOGY\n \n A lot of you are uncomfortable with using war and fighting terminology to describe your situation and your way of dealing with terrorism from religion and culture. You cannot, however, ignore the reality of religious terrorism's threats to your self-esteem, self-acceptance, and your capacity to enjoy a full and meaningful life. You are not garbage; so don't let anybody treat you like garbage! If you believe you really are garbage, you will act like garbage, and that is a steep downhill ride to a very hard landing.\n \n People who have become convinced that their basic nature is somehow flawed and even evil in the sight of God have a hard time developing objective personal insight into their self and into their real life situation. Challenge the threatening and demeaning assumptions that have been dumped on you by others. Take a good look at what you believe about yourself. Dispute the negative assumptions about yourself that sick abusive religion has inflicted upon you.\n \n Spiritual warfare is a reality, and your greatest problem in dealing with spiritual warfare often is the presence within you of many opposing sides. Remember, however, that you are not alone! Whatever you are struggling to resolve within yourself is also happening in millions of other people.\n \n Meditation, small group study and dialogue, reading accurate information, writing a daily journal, getting physical exercise, taking time to rest and relax, and a lot of other avenues of reflection and renewal are open to you. If you cannot find a small group to join, start your own group. Do whatever fits you.\n \n LET'S ROLL!\n \n Rembert Truluck\n February 1, 2002\n \n YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE GAY \n TO BE ABUSED BY RELIGION\n \n In December, 1989, I received the following letter. It reminded me that many people besides homosexuals have been abused and hurt by legalistic judgmental religion. \n \n \"I wanted to tell you how much I enjoy your web site and just how helpful the information it contains has been for me and my husband.\n \n \"We are just beginning to recover from a horrific experience in a legalistic, fundamental, extremist church. Neither of us is homosexual, however my husband was molested as a child. He never ever told anyone what had happened or how it had affected him. He just finally told me a few months ago. He struggled all his life with bi-sexual feeling and couldn't talk to anyone about them. I understand why he couldn't.\n \n \"We were fundamentalists to the core. We home schooled our children and loved and listened to all the \"religious right\" tv and radio programs, magazines, books and organizations. It got to the point I was wearing only homemade dresses, wearing a head covering...My family thought I was nuts. I was raised in a non-religious home. They thought we had gone off the deep end, which we had!\n \n \"To make a REALLY long story short, I ended up with a serious depression and almost committed suicide because of all the legalism. As a woman, I was treated like XXXX by the church, other men, as well as my husband. So I threw off all the legalist garbage and went on my own search for God, for the real Jesus. Found Him too. And He isn't anything at all like the one we had been lead to believe in.\n \n \"But living right smack in the middle of the bible belt, USA, isn't easy. The computer is my lifeline for now. At least until we can find somewhere we fit in, which isn't gonna be too easy. I'm thinking and praying about placing a small ad in a local paper and see if there are any others, straight or not, who would like to start a support group. I have to admit that the possibility of the backlash from the local \"fundies\" scares the hell outta me.\n \n \"This has gotten really long. Better go. Thanks for the site! Keep up the good work!\"\n \n I have received many similar letters from non-gay people who have suffered abuse and oppression from religion. This web site is here to inform, encourage, and help anyone who finds it. Religious abuse and oppression of homosexuals, women, racial minorities, children, scientists, divorced people, mentally ill and retarded people, prisoners, the homeless, many other minorities, and anybody who is \"different\" are the result of ignorance and a distorted and twisted use of the Bible. Use this web site in any way that helps you and pass it on to others. \n \n MY BACKGROUND FOR THIS WEB SITE\n \n When I was a Southern Baptist Pastor and Professor, I wrote Adult Sunday School materials for the Southern Baptist Sunday School Board. This web site and my book are my attempt to build on what I learned there and to provide quality gay positive spiritual materials for Gays, Lesbians, Bisexuals, Transsexuals and all other people abused and wounded by sick and oppressive religion. Steps To Recovery From Bible Abuse was developed during my years of teaching, writing and preaching in Metropolitan Community Church (\"MCC\") Atlanta and when I was Senior Pastor of Golden Gate MCC, San Francisco, and MCC Nashville. \n \n My own personal experience with \"steps to recovery\" began when I admitted in 1989 that I had lost control of my drinking and was an alcoholic. I finally went to an AA meeting in Atlanta with my friend Daniel on August 8, 1989, took a \"white chip\" and began the road to recovery that continues to the present. I learned that the key for me was to live \"one day at a time\" and to turn my life over to God to help me keep my promise to myself to get sober and stay sober.\n \n As I continued to teach the Bible at First MCC in Atlanta and then became Pastor of Golden Gate MCC in San Francisco, I began to realize that addiction to abusive religion was an underlying basic problem for many gay and lesbian Christians. When I became Pastor of MCC Nashville, I began to work out the \"steps to recovery\" that are given in this web site and in my book, Steps to Recovery from Bible Abuse. \n \n I led Bible Study groups and Spiritual Recovery and Growth groups at each of the churches I served. For over two years, I led a weekly Spiritual Recovery and Support group in my home while I was Senior Pastor of MCC Nashville. Our average attendance varied from 10 to 35 people. We learned from each other. We developed an accepting and nonjudgmental atmosphere where people felt safe to be themselves and to deal with their own personal and spiritual issues. We learned to help each other by accepting and listening to each other. This web site will help you start such a group yourself. \n \n The material in my forthcoming book, Steps To Recovery From Bible Abuse, published by Chi Rho Press, consists of 52 chapters that were developed from these weekly home group meetings and that provide information and guidance for following the Twelve Steps To Recovery outlined in this web site. \n \n The following updates relate to \n why this web site is here:\n \n The main purpose of \"Steps to Recovery from Bible Abuse\" web site is to give encouragement and hope to people who have been denied encouragement and hope by the abusive use of the Bible and religion against them.\n \n See May 14, 2001, update on \"FOLLOWING THE WRONG JESUS\"\n \n The following Update was added on September 10, 2001:\n \"SPIRITUAL LIBERATION\"\n \n What destructive force most compromises your freedom? Is it a person? A habit? Inner conflict? Abusive religion? What?\n \n Jesus came declaring his purpose to be a liberator. His liberation ministry was set forth clearly in his keynote speech given in Luke 4:18-19: \"The Spirit of God is upon me; Because God has anointed (\"messiah\") me to announce good news to the poor (the \"outcasts\"). God has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and the recovery of sight to those who cannot see and to set free those who are downtrodden (\"kicked\" and \"stepped on\"); to announce the time of God's acceptance of all people.\"\n \n Elsewhere Jesus made it clear that his mission was to liberate the people from sick religion and to open their eyes to the hypocrisy and lies of abusive legalistic religion. All of the Gospel of Luke demonstrates how Jesus accepted and liberated people who were \"kicked and stepped on\" by religion.\n \n The religion that Jesus faced, like religion today, defined itself primarily by who was left out, who was unclean, who was a \"sinner\" and who was considered to be righteous by keeping every detail of the Law. The mysterious final statement that Jesus came to \"proclaim the acceptable (or \"favorable\") year of the Lord\" seems to me to say that Jesus was showing how exclusive rejecting religion was being replaced in the present time (\"year\") of God's acceptance (of all people).\n \n SICK RELIGION IS NOT NEW\n \n This is not just speculation. The clear application that Jesus made about these announcements was to remind the people that God had always accepted outsiders and aliens as when Elijah and Elisha ministered to non-Jews. The reaction of the people was to turn against Jesus and attempt to kill him in defense of their exclusive misinformed abusive religion!\n \n This incident at the beginning of the public ministry of Jesus demonstrates several very significant features of the religious situation we face today. Sick religion is hard to challenge and change. Sick religion is possessive and controlling and refuses willingly to give up power. Sick religion holds people captive, blinds them to the truth, and turns them against each other and against anyone who challenges their legalistic abusive teachings.\n \n People who are victims of sick abusive religion are \"downtrodden, \"stepped on\" and \"kicked around.\" Does this sound familiar in the experiences of GLBT people today, including you and me? GLBT people obviously are not the only victims of abusive religion.\n \n YOUR \"HOUR OF DECISION\"\n \n From the beginning, Billy Graham called his radio and later television broadcasts \"The Hour of Decision.\" I listened to these programs on radio long before I saw any television. You and I also face a clear hour of decision now. You have to decide to accept, affirm and define yourself as God has created you in God's image or else allow misinformed abusive religion to judge you and define who you are.\n \n Life-long confusion and conflict about your true identity as a GLBT person distracts you from living your life to the fullest and diminishes your sense of well being for a lifetime. You cannot be healthy and happy trying to build your own self-esteem and trying to please abusive religion at the same time. You face a necessary \"hour of decision\" even as you read this.\n \n In the Gospels, Jesus constantly called for an immediate decision: \"Follow me.\" This always meant and still means letting go of sick abusive religion in order to enter into freedom, love, joy and peace.\n \n LIBERATION MEANS CHANGE\n \n Freedom can be ours, but are we there yet? The path of abusive religion leads to conflict, contradictions and confusion, not to freedom. Traditional abusive religion is not a road to freedom. It is a detour around freedom. Liberation means a change in the way you see yourself.\n \n Freedom in Christ is based on recognizing and entering into the humanity of Jesus. To deny the humanity of Jesus is to deny your own humanity and cast yourself in the impossible role of trying to play God both by abandoning your own relationship with God as Creator and Sovereign and by assuming the hypocritical role of telling other people how to think and run their lives.\n \n To identify with and follow Jesus is to accept and celebrate your own humanity just as Jesus did his. You are not superman or superwoman. You are blessed with the image of God in human form. You can relate to God and to yourself and to others with freedom and confidence, because Jesus has demonstrated and taught how to do it.\n \n The religious crust that has accumulated over Jesus for 2,000 years has obscured the truth and made Jesus into an unbelievable magician and an object of superstition that hinders our freedom to be real and honest to God, to ourselves and to others. True spiritual freedom means rescuing Jesus from the fundamentalists and from every other form of abusive sick religion .\n \n WHAT IS THE WAY TO LIBERATION?\n \n What can you do to replace the abusive legalism in your life that you have been conditioned to believe and accept as truth? No religion at all is better than sick abusive legalism! Jesus came to offer himself as a clear alternative to sick religion.\n \n Conflict over who you really are is not limited to LGBT people. Abusive religion hurts everybody. Parents cooperate with sick religion and use it to control and invalidate their children. Politicians, rulers and empires have used abusive religion to keep multitudes of people in subjection. History has shown that true liberation is never easy.\n \n I receive abusive letters from committed legalists almost every day telling me how hateful and mean I am to offer the kind of hope and acceptance that is found for GLBT people on my web site and in my book. Judgmental legalistic fundamentalists always seem to be personally threatened by facts that challenge their systems. I am an easy target, because I can be attacked anonymously in e-mail. \n \n One result of the steady stream of attack e-mail that I get is to convince me of the absolute necessity of keeping my web site on the Internet to help LGBT people deal with ignorance and religious abuse. I am amazed at the level of blatant ignorance about the Bible that is demonstrated by people who feel that it is their calling to defend the honor of God against heretics like me. I shudder to realize the hold that ignorance has on millions of religious people.\n \n Ignorance is never healthy or redemptive. Most real liberation is freedom from some form of ignorance. God's truth will set you free to be yourself and to realize your potential as a fully functioning human being.\n \n Homosexuality: Challenging the Church to Grow",

There are perhaps half a dozen brief references to it in all of Scripture. In terms of emphasis, it is a minor concern-in contrast, for example, to economic injustice.\n \n .......\n In I Corinthians 6, Paul, exasperated with the Corinthians, some of whom apparently believe themselves to have entered a spiritually exalted state in which the moral rules of their old existence no longer apply to them (cf. I Cor. 4:8, 5:1-2, 8:1-9), confronts them with a blunt rhetorical question: \"Do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God?\" He then gives an illustrative list of the sorts of persons he means: \"fornicators, idolaters, adulterers, malakoi, arsenokoitai, thieves, the greedy, drunkards, revilers, robbers.\" \n I have left the terms pertinent to the present issue untranslated, because their translation has been disputed. The word malakoi is not a technical term meaning \"homosexuals\" (no such term existed either in Greek or in Hebrew), but it appears often in Hellenistic Greek as pejorative slang to describe the \"passive\" partners-often young boys-in homosexual activity. The word, arsenokoitai., is not found in any extant Greek text earlier than I Corinthians. Some scholars have suggested that its meaning is uncertain, but Robin Scroggs has shown that the word is a translation of the Hebrew mishkav zakur (\"lying with the male), derived directly from Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 and used in rabbinic texts to refer to homosexual intercourse. The Septuagint (Greek Old Testament) of Leviticus 20:13 reads, \"Whoever lies with a man as with a woman [meta arsenos koiten gynaikos], they have both done an abomination.\" This is almost certainly the idiom from which the noun arsenokoitai was coined. Thus, Paul's use of the term presupposes and reaffirms the holiness code's condemnation of homosexual acts. This is not a controversial point in Paul's argument; the letter gives no evidence that anyone at Corinth was arguing for the acceptance of same-sex erotic activity. Paul simply assumes that his readers will share his conviction that those who indulge in homosexual activity are \"wrongdoers\" (adikoi, literally \"unrighteous\"), along with other sorts of offenders in his list.\n \n \n \n The genius of Paul's analysis lies in his refusal to posit a catalog of sins as the cause of human alienation from God. Instead, he delves to the root: all other depravities follow from the radical rebellion of the creature against the Creator (1:24-31). In order to make his accusation stick, Paul has to claim that these human beings are actually in rebellion against God, not merely ignorant of him. The way in which the argument is framed here is crucial: ignorance is the consequence of humanity's primal rebellion. Because human beings did not acknowledge God, \"they became futile in their thinking, and their senseless minds were darkened.\" The passage is not merely a polemical denunciation of selected pagan vices; it is a diagnosis of the human condition. The diseased behavior detailed in verses 24-31 is symptomatic of the one sickness of humanity as a whole. Because they have turned away from God, \"all, both Jews and Greeks, are under the power of sin.\" The aim of Romans 1 is not to teach a code of sexual ethics; nor is the passage a warning of God's judgment against those who are guilty of particular sins. Rather, Paul is offering a diagnosis of the disordered human condition: he adduces the fact of widespread homosexual behavior as evidence that human beings are indeed in rebellion against their creator. Homosexuality, then, is not a provocation of \"the wrath of God\" (Rom. 1:18); rather, it is a consequence of God's decision to \"give up\" rebellious creatures to follow their own futile thinking and desires. \n \n \n \n Food for thought.",

I'm not into \"bathhouses\". I'm in the 10th year of a monogamous, committed relationship, that, in my estimation, could not have happened if God had not intervened. \n \n I don't subscribe to your distorted view of Biblical Scripture, which you interpret to mean what you would have it mean...so that you have a sense of self-righteousness, and willfully judge others, as Christ specifically instructed us not to do. http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=122\n What does Scripture have to say about homosexuality? The Christian community now possesses for the first time some excellent scholarly works on the treatment of homosexuality in Scripture, such as Robin Scroggs's The New Testament and Homosexuality (Fortress, 1984) and George Edwards's Gay/Lesbian Liberation: A Biblical Perspective (Pilgrim, 1984). We also have an excellent study of the development of Christian tradition regarding homosexuality: John Boswell's Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality: Gay People in Western Europe from the Beginning of the Christian Era to the Fourteenth Century (University of Chicago Press, 1980). And there are some very good theological reflections on human sexuality in the light of Christian revelation; see James Nelson's, Embodiment: An Approach to Sexuality, and Christian Theology (Pilgrim, 1978) and Between Two Gardens: Reflections on Sexuality and Religious Experience. (Pilgrim, 1983).\n \n These scholars conclude that nowhere in Scripture is there a clear condemnation of a loving sexual relationship between two gay persons. Homosexuality is never mentioned in the Four Gospels' accounts of the ministry of Jesus -- a silence that would be inexplicable if this were the \"most heinous crime,\" as tradition claims. Scriptural authors never deal with homosexual orientation, and when they do treat homosexual activity, they never do so in the context of a loving relationship. They presuppose that they are dealing with lustful activity freely chosen by heterosexuals (as in Romans 1), or they deal with a humanly destructive activity in the context of idolatry, prostitution, promiscuity, violent rape, seduction of children or violation of guests' rights. \n \n \n All in all, this is a great moment to be gay and Christian. This is the age when the Holy Spirit is fulfilling the promise made in Isaiah (56: 2-8) that after the Messiah comes and the new covenant is established, those who are sexually different, who were formerly excluded from the community of God, will have a special place in the house of the Lord and \"an everlasting name which shall not be cut off.\" The fulfillment of this prophecy was foreshadowed when the Holy Spirit led the apostle Philip to encounter the eunuch, who was reading Isaiah (Acts 8:26-40). The author of Acts intended to show how under the new covenant the church, led by the Holy Spirit, would reach out to include all those who were excluded by the Old Testament's procreational covenant. The eunuch symbolizes all those excluded from the Old Testament community because they were sexually different. The eunuch believed in Christ as the Messiah, was baptized, received the Spirit and went off \"full of joy.\"\n \n \"My house,\" God says through Isaiah, \"shall be called a house of prayer for all people.\" The gay Christian movement is continuing this initiative of the Holy Spirit, offering the Christian churches a challenge and an opportunity to grow to the full stature of the human family. \n \n \n Liberal interpretation of Romans 1:26-27\n \n Romans 1:26-27\n \n The passage is unrelated to homosexuality: \n The complete passage describes how a group of Christians left the church, converted to Paganism, and engaged in orgiastic, presumably heterosexual sexual activities. This type of behavior was common among Pagan fertility religions in Rome during Paul's time. Paul writes that, later, God \"gave them over\" to something new: homosexual behavior. This implies that they had a heterosexual orientation and had engaged only in heterosexual sex throughout their lifetime. God influenced them in some way to engage in homosexual orgies. This was, for them, an unnatural, and thus sinful, activity. \n \n Paul criticized them because they were engaged in sexual activity which was unnatural for them. For a person with a heterosexual orientation, homosexual behavior is \"shameful,\" \"unnatural,\" \"indecent,\" and a \"perversion.\" The passage in Romans is not a condemnation of homosexual behavior. Rather, it disapproves of sexual behavior that is against a person's basic nature (i.e. homosexual behaviors by people whose orientation is heterosexual). 2 \n \n For the vast majority of adults, those who are heterosexual, it is indecent for them to engage in homosexual activities. One can interpret Paul's writing as stating that, for the small minority of humans who are homosexual, it would be indecent for them to engage in heterosexual activities. \n \n As C. Ann Shepherd writes: \"When the scripture is understood correctly, it seems to imply that it would be unnatural for heterosexuals to live as homosexuals, and for homosexuals to live as heterosexuals.\" 3\n \n Bruce Hahne writes, in point form: \n \n \"Verses 26-27 exploit Jewish cultural prejudices. \n Good rhetorical strategy: begin with assumptions of audience, build on them to make your point. \n So Romans 1:26-27 speaks only of heterosexual people who act 'contrary to their nature.' \n The text provides neither ethical nor behavioral guidance to lesbian, bay or bisexual people.\" 4 \n \n \n \n The passage is not related to committed same-sex relationships:\n Some question whether the word \"perversion\" in Verse 27, and \"such things\" in Verse 30 are related to only certain types of gay and lesbian behavior. e.g.: \n \n Homosexual orgies, or \n Group same-gender sexual practices in a religious setting. This was a common practice among Pagans at the time; e.g. in the temples dedicated to the Goddess Aphrodite. \n Casual homosexual activities outside of a committed, monogamous two person relationship, or \n Homosexual molestation between a man and a child. In Paul's day, the child victim was often a slave. \n \n These probably were the only forms of same-sex activity that Paul was familiar with. Paul may well have not been thinking of gays and lesbians in committed relationships when he wrote this passage. He never referred to such couples in his writings, and probably never encountered any during his lifetime. He might simply have been condemning homosexual orgies and other sexual activities outside of a monogamous same-sex relationship.\n \n \n \n The passage's homosexual implications of minor importance: \n Many English translations render the end of Verse 27 as \"due penalty of their error.\" Their basic error was not homosexuality. It was for former Pagans who converted to Pauline Christianity to leave the faith, return to Paganism, and engage in idolatry. That is the main theme of the argument. From the idolatry flowed sexual orgies, sexual behavior against their nature, wickedness, greed, murder, etc. The intent of the passage is to show how idolatry leads to complete degeneration of their behavior: to evil, envy, treachery, spite, gossiping, etc. The reference to what was, for them, unnatural homosexual behavior seems almost incidental, to the story. It was merely one symptom of the results of Pagan idolatry. \n \n Arland J. Hultgren writes:\n \n \"Paul is not speaking here of homosexual orientation. Instead, he is talking about the gentile world, a world of idolaters, who long ago rejected the worship of God and became a culture of abuse, in which power and conquest were established and displayed in sexual acts.\" 5\n \n \n \n Passage refers to bisexuals not homosexuals: \n In Greek and Roman society of the time, bisexuality was regarded as quite natural; people in some walks of society were expected to engage in bisexual relations. Since most of them were heterosexual, bisexual activity would be against their personal nature. Romans 1 discusses such individuals first engaging in opposite-sex orgies, and then migrating to same-sex orgies. That is, by engaging in both opposite-sex and same-sex behavior, they were attempting to behave as bisexuals; this would be against their heterosexual nature. \n \n The Apostolic Restoration Mission, a Pentecostal organization, states \n \n \"...God created each of us with a sexual orientation. To attempt to change it is, in effect, telling God that He created us wrong. The creation (us) does not have the right to 're-create' itself.\" \n \n \n I'm sorry if your panties are in a bunch because I refuse to subscribe to or acknowledge your interpretation of Scripture (and it is \"your interpretation\" as I have provided the interpretations of others, who represent the opposite POV.)\n I have no idea what faith you are...but I'll bet you're evangelical, and they have a history of being religious fanatics. I grew up Episcopalian. The Episcopal Church has opposing points of view. One is very traditional and stoic, the other, more tolerant of the gay community and women. \n I attended a church for 4 years where the hate of gays and lesbians was tolerated and encouraged. Never again. That church was not of Christ. You're not \"of Christ\"..but you're free to go your own way, and believe whatever you choose to believe. Afford me the same courtesy.",

For a person with a heterosexual orientation, homosexual behavior is \"shameful,\" \"unnatural,\" \"indecent,\" and a \"perversion.\" The passage in Romans is not a condemnation of homosexual behavior. Rather, it disapproves of sexual behavior that is against a person's basic nature (i.e. homosexual behaviors by people whose orientation is heterosexual). 2 \n\n \n Nope. That's your gay spin cycle working overtime. No one is buying it except the pro gay sinner's club.\n \n \nI'm sorry if your panties are in a bunch...\n\n \n That's your gig. Are you the man or the woman in your illicit, pro gay affair?\n \n \nI have no idea what faith you are...but I'll bet you're evangelical, and they have a history of being religious fanatics.\n\n \n As opposed to pro gay sex fanatics who sue the Boy scouts and try to cram their ungodly agenda down the throats of school children? \n \n \n\n \n I attended a church for 4 years where the hate of gays and lesbians was tolerated and encouraged. Never again. That church was not of Christ. You're not \"of Christ\"..but you're free to go your own way, and believe whatever you choose to believe. Afford me the same courtesy.\n\n \n Any church that embraces sin, such as illicit gay sex relationships, and encourages that behavior, is more a synagogue of Satan than a Church of Jesus Christ. Jesus warned about those wolves in sheep's clothing.",

You can't go out and willfully murder and butcher a million people and expect to get into heaven. You can't reject God and expect to be accepted with open arms because it doesn't work that way.

It's been said that no man can get into heaven on his own, and you're going to be a shining example of that. You're going to burn unless you accept God and abide by His rules. But since you likely won't be doing that all we can say is that we hope you enjoy hell.\n\n \n Thank you for your concern..but I don't buy it, because I don't have to. \n Sodom and Gomorrah is a fable.

He preached against homosexuality. Then, five years ago, his middle son, Micah, told him that he is gay. Mr. Meredith and his wife began to read liberal theologians like Mr. Gomes and to look at Scripture again. What matters most in the Bible, Mr. Meredith said, was Jesus' injunction to love God and to love your neighbor as yourself, and that includes gay men and lesbians. -Source\n \n It's called \"enlightenment\", EZ.",

The Bible is the Liar .. Ever read the Old testament?.. Ever read the Messianic Prophesies?.. You do realize that JESUS was not the Messiah According to the Bible? \n \n Matthew 1:23 says that the Messiah would be called ( Immanuel) Which means \"God with us\" . No one in the Bible , not even his parents, ever call Jesus Immanuel. ( Failed Prophecy #1..\n \n Romans 1:3 and Acts 2:30 State that the Messiah MUST be a descendant of David. Jesus does not meet this requirement since his Genealogies in Matthew 1 and Luke 3 Show he descended from David through Joseph, who was not his Natural father , therefore Failed Prophecy #2....\n \n Isaiah 7:16 Implies that before the Messiah reaches the age of Maturity, both Jewish countries will be destroyed. Hmmm.. no mention of this prophecy being fulfilled in the New Testament with the coming of Jebus... Failed Prophecy #3...\n \n Zechariah 9:10-13 referred to the Messiah as being a Military King who would rule from sea to sea... Sorry, Jebus had no Army, and he had no Kingdom... Failed Prophecy #4\n \n John 19:33 says that during Jesus' crucifixion, the soldiers didn't break his legs because he was already dead. Verse John 19:36 claims that this fulfilled a prophecy: \"Not a bone of him shall be broken.\" But there is no such prophecy. It is sometimes said that the prophecy appears in Exodus 12:46, Numbers 9:12 & Psalm 34:20. This is not correct. Exodus 12:46 & Numbers 9:12 are not prophecies, they are commandments. The Israelites are told not to break the bones of the Passover lamb, and this is all it is about. And Psalm 34:20 seems to refer to righteous people in general (see verse Psalm 34:19, where a plural is used), not to make a prophecy about a specific person... Failed Prophecy #5\n \n \n \"When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.\" Hosea 11:1. Matthew (Matthew 2:15) claims that the flight of Jesus' family to Egypt is a fulfillment of this verse. But Hosea 11:1 is not a prophecy at all. It is a reference to the Hebrew exodus from Egypt and has nothing to do with Jesus. Matthew tries to hide this fact by quoting only the last part of the verse (\"Out of Egypt I have called my son\")... So Matthew is the Liar here... Failed Prophecy #6\n \n \n \n Now let's see who the Real Liar is...\n \n In John 14:13-14 Jesus stated: \"And whatsoever ye ask in my name I do, that the Father may be glorified in the son. If ye ask any thing in my name, I will do it.\" \n \n Now I know you have asked in Jesus Name for us Evil Liberals to be wiped off the face of the planet.. Yet here we are..\n Parents all over the world ask in Jesus name that he save their dying Children yet their children Die anyway...\n Jesus Lied.. He does not do as he said he would do... \n \n So now we see who the REAL Liars are. The Bible would be the Number one Biggest Liar .. followed by you Christian Literalist whackjobs who continue to spread the Bible and it's Lies....",

It doesn't really matter though since In my View none of it is real anyway, I was only pointing out how Ignorant EZ really is.\n \n 13 Then Isaiah said, \"Hear now, you house of David! Is it not enough to try the patience of humans? Will you try the patience of my God also? 14 Therefore the Lord himself will give you[c] a sign: The virgin[d] will conceive and give birth to a son, and[e] will call him Immanuel.[f] 15 He will be eating curds and honey when he knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right, 16 for before the boy knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right, the land of the two kings you dread will be laid waste. 17 The LORD will bring on you and on your people and on the house of your father a time unlike any since Ephraim broke away from Judah-he will bring the king of Assyria.\" ",

That happens all the time. How is that special and noteworthy? \n \n Only if she were a virgin would that be unusual.\n[/QUOTE]\n \n Who said it had to be big deal? What kind of signs are bad weather and signs of war? They are both everyday occurrences, yet are touted as de facto signs that we are in the end times.\n \n With reference to the scriptures, it says that a child will be born eating butter (meaning cheese curds) and honey. I've seen that this meant that times in Judah would be hard (Barren fields would mean lots of flowers, and thus lots of honey, and a lack of young goats and cattle would mean less young to drink their mothers' milk, leading to an abundance of milk, making curds very common). This is what a commentary says on the subject, although I always assumed that it simply referred to 'pure' or natural foods. The commentary's answer makes much more sense, though.\n \n So lets see... a kid will be born and called Immanuel during tough times for Judah, and before he reaches the age of reason, the two kingdoms giving Ahaz trouble would fall. Sounds like a pretty normal biblical prophesy to me.\n \n \n \nNot necessarily. See above. Plus, who was the big, important Immanuel in Ahaz's day? Nobody I've seen.\n\n \n There wasn't one that I know of. It's a failed prophecy (like many others)... This is the problem with you literalists. If a \"prophesy\" isn't fulfilled, you will try and twist something unrelated around to attempt to match it. Just because there is no mention of an Immanuel doesn't change the meaning of the original text.\n \n As for the \"not necessarily during Ahaz' life\"... you're busted. Again, you ignore the context. \n \n This is God speaking to Isaiah, telling him to speak to Ahaz and let him know not to worry, since these kings, who are enemies to Ahaz, will fail and their kingdoms will fall soon:\n \n \n8For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people.\n \n 9And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established.\n\n \n Ahaz died around 715 BC. Ahaz was obviously alive when this was happening, and it was to come to pass within 65 years. \n \n This is exactly what the prophesy is referring to in verses 14-16. The sign was to tell of the destruction of the kingdoms. Look at verse 16:\n \n \n16For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings.\n\n \n Even if you believed that this prophesy could be fulfilled after Ahaz' death, the latest it could happen would be around 650 years before Jesus. How is this even disputable?\n \n \nNIV - \"called\" Immanuel. Jesus is called Immanuel today.\n\n \n We've had this discussion before, and your answer is as weak of an argument now as it was then. Every other time in the bible that the word \"called\" is used in reference to a name, the person is NAMED whatever it is that is said, and is referred to by that name in the scripture. There is also no evidence that Jesus was called Immanuel at all when he was alive (which is all that matters since the verse says that the mother \"shall call him Immanuel.\" v14. If it hadn't been specific, it would simply be a self fulfilling prophecy since anybody could call him anything after the fact). \n \n \nA young woman in that day and culture was considered a virgin. Rebekah was an almah and she was identified as a virgin. Plus, nowhere in scripture is an almah seen as one who was defrocked. So your initial premise is false.\n\n \n An almah can, and in most cases would, be a virgin, but it doesn't specifically mean 'virgin.' There is a separate word in Hebrew that means virgin, and you would think that if this was supposed to be such a big deal, they would want to highlight that she was a virgin, instead of highlighting that she was a young lady. \n \n I'm not just making stuff up with the word 'almah,'... this is the accepted view of bible believin' scholars. \n \n Almah: Virgin or Young Maiden? - http://www.jewsforjesus.org/publications/issues/9_1/almah/\n \n \nYou blew it. Nice try, though.\n\n \n Ha.",

   "You err because you are ignorant of the proper scriptures, and are spiritually blinded.\n \n The Messiah was supposed to be the son of God. From Isaiah 9:\n \n 6 For to us a child is born, \n to us a son is given, \n and the government will be on his shoulders. \n And he will be called \n Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, \n Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. \n 7 Of the greatness of his government and peace \n there will be no end. \n He will reign on David's throne \n and over his kingdom, \n establishing and upholding it \n with justice and righteousness \n from that time on and forever.\n \n If he's to be the son of God, how can he be the blood son of Joseph? \n \n That's why Jesus was conceived by God the Holy Ghost.\n \n If you want to talk Isaiah, learn what's going on.\n\n \n Son of God doesn't necessarily mean that someone is the divine, literal, son of God. In Jewish texts, the Hebrew people and the Hebrew kings were often referred to as \"sons of God.\" This is why many scholars take the viewpoint that Jesus never claimed to be God or be divine in any of the Synoptic Gospels.\n \n For an example of this, look at 2 Samuel 7:14. To really get the gist, you will need to read the whole chapter in context, which I know you don't like to do, but I won't put all of it here and will just show you verse 14 which has God speaking:\n \n \n14I will be his father, and he will be my son. When he does wrong, I will punish him with the rod of men, with floggings inflicted by men.\n\n \n \n You also need to ask yourself... why is it that no Jew expected the Messiah to be divine or really anything like Jesus? The Jews expected the Messiah to be a powerful political and military leader from the lineage of David who would retake the throne to lead Israel and cast out all the Romans and sinners and remake Israel into a power like they once were. (See Psalms 2:1-9... an actual Messianic prophesy that uses the term 'anointed one,' AKA 'Messiah'.)\n \n The idea that Jesus, a poor, meek little apocalyptic preacher from a little one horse, po-dunk town, who was easily arrested and put to death without a fight, was the Messiah was laughable and blasphemous to most Jews. The Jews expected the real Messiah to conquer the Romans, not the other way around.",

From the text, it isn't so much about the child, but about the timespan. You keep begging the question by assuming that this child had to be like Jesus and be ultra-famous and important, when the actual words of the bible don't prophesy that at all. \n \n It never says whether the child is the son of Isaiah. Some scholars think it was Ahaz' son, Hezekiah (who was famous, was a king, and was born from an almah). Per wiki:\n \n \nSome writers[1] consider that Abijah is the almah or virgin (at the time of the prophecy) in the Immanuel prophecy in Isaiah 7:14, and that the child who will be an infant when Rezin and Pekah are defeated by Tiglath Pileser III may be the future heir, Hezekiah.\n\n \n \n I don't pretend to know the ins and outs of Hebrew, but I do know that a lot of the language in the Old Testament (with names especially) is metaphorical (like Abraham meaning 'father of many,' and he was told to have as many descendents as the stars of the sky, Moses meaning 'deliver,' Adam meaning 'earth,' etc). In Chapter 8, the term Immanuel/\"God is with us\" is used twice. I don't particularly know exactly what or who those terms are supposed to be referencing, or if they are related to the child, but the references to Immanuel are present. Whether the Immanuel thing was meant to be a name, or simply metaphor... I don't know. The wording leads me to believe it was a name. \n \n And even if it wasn't Maher-...-baz or a Hezekiah (or an unmentioned son of Ahaz), it doesn't change the fact that Jesus doesn't fulfill the prophesy. Those kingdoms and kings fell 700+ years before Jesus was born. Again, are you denying that the child's early life as described in chapter 7 is the sign that foretells the fall of kings Rezin and Pekah, as is clearly stated?\n \n I'm more than okay chalking it up as another failed biblical prophesy if there wasn't a child born to fit the description of the prophesy, but come on; you aren't even trying to be objective or rational.",

The son will not share the guilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the son. The righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him.\n\n \n Although I wouldn't at all be surprised if there were other verses contradicting that one.\n \n \nPerhaps there's a dual fulfillment, as in Hosea 11:1 and elsewhere. Google \"Bible dual fulfillment in prophecy.\"\n\n \n Oh, how nice. A Christian invention to help their beliefs fit in with the Old Testament views. I read about this earlier when reading about Isaiah 7:14, but didn't think you would bring it up since it's such a flimsy argument. \n \n It's like the people that try to say Judas hung himself, then fell and burst open to reconcile the contradictory accounts, or those who try to reconcile the contradiction of Peter denying Jesus three times (one gospel says the XXXX crowed twice, the others only once) by saying that Peter must have denied Jesus six times. It's nothing more than twisting words to make them fit your view (hence the name, the Big Book of Multiple Choice).\n \n Even then, I don't see how it is a dual fulfillment when Jesus' life didn't foretell the fall of the two kingdoms. If I prophesied that a meteorite would strike earth and take out Kim Jong Il, and it came to pass, then 700 years later a meteorite hits in the middle of Kansas, it's an unrelated event.

Where does logic say the two accounts have to be exclusionary instead of complementary?\n \n How did Judas die, by hanging or falling down?\n Matthew 27:3-8 and Acts 1:16-19\n \n \n By hanging (Matthew 27:3-8) - \"Then when Judas, who had betrayed Him, saw that He had been condemned, he felt remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, 4saying, \"I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.\" But they said, \"What is that to us? See to that yourself!\" 5And he threw the pieces of silver into the sanctuary and departed; and he went away and hanged himself. 6And the chief priests took the pieces of silver and said, \"It is not lawful to put them into the temple treasury, since it is the price of blood.\" 7And they counseled together and with the money bought the Potter&#8217;s Field as a burial place for strangers. 8For this reason that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.\"\n \n By falling (Acts 1:16-19) - \"Brethren, the Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit foretold by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus. 17\"For he was counted among us, and received his portion in this ministry.\" 18(Now this man acquired a field with the price of his wickedness; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his bowels gushed out. 19And it became known to all who were living in Jerusalem; so that in their own language that field was called Hakeldama, that is, Field of Blood.)\"\n \n There is no contradiction here at all because both are true. A contradiction occurs when one statement excludes the possibility of another. The Second Law of Logic, the Law of Non Contradition, (LNC) says that something cannot be both true and false at the same time and in the same sense. It is not a contradiction to describe something differently: Judas was hung and Judas fell down. Both are possible since neither negates the possibility of the other. A contradiction occurs when one statement makes another statement impossible but both are said to be true. So, what happened here is that Judas went and hung himself and then his body later fell down and split open. In other words, the rope or branch of the tree probably broke due to the weight and his body fell down and his bowels spilled out.\n \n Also, notice that Matt. 27:3-8 tells us specifically how Judas died, by hanging. Acts 1:16-19 merely tells us that he fell headlong and his bowels gushed out. Acts does not tell us that this is the means of his death where Matthew does.\n \n \n You're busted.",

Why is the field called 'the field of blood'?\n\n \n There's no contradictions. Never was.\n \n \"I suppose if common sense and unbiased reasoning were omitted from this discussion, then one might conclude that these differences represent a legitimate contradiction. If one believes it is wrong to say a father bought a car for his son, when in actuality the son purchased the car with $5,000 his father gave him, then I suppose that Acts 1:18 and Matthew 27:5-6 are contradictory. If one believes that it is wrong to say an employer purchased a meal for his staff, when it really was one of the employees who handed the money to the waiter, then the events recorded in Acts 1:18 could be considered fictitious. But what reasonable person would reach such conclusions as these?\n \n Acts 1:18 simply informs us that Judas furnished the means of purchasing the field. One is not forced to conclude that Judas personally bought the potter&#8217;s field. As in modern-day writings and speeches, it is very common for the Scriptures to represent a man as doing a thing when, in fact, he merely supplies the means for doing it. For example, Joseph spoke of his brothers as selling him into Egypt (Genesis 45:4-5; cf. Acts 7:9), when actually they sold him to the Ishmaelites (who then sold him into Egypt). John mentions that &#8220;the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John (though Jesus Himself did not baptize, but His disciples)&#8221; (John 4:1-3). And when the Bible says, &#8220;Pilate took Jesus and scourged Him&#8221; (John 19:1), most people understand that he simply ordered Jesus to be scourged, not that he actually did the scourging himself. The same principle is recognized in law in the well-known Latin maxim, &#8220;Qui facit per alium, facit per se&#8221; (&#8220;he who acts through another is deemed in law to do it himself&#8221;).\n \n Whether one says that Judas &#8220;purchased a field with the wages of iniquity&#8221; (Acts 1:18), or that the chief priests &#8220;bought with them the potter&#8217;s field&#8221; (Matthew 27:7), he has stated the same truth, only in different ways.\"\n \n Apologetics Press - Who Bought the Potter&#8217;s Field?\n \n Why is it called the \"field of blood\"?\n \n The Bible answers that in Matthew 27:\n \n 3 When Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he was seized with remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders. 4 &#8220;I have sinned,&#8221; he said, &#8220;for I have betrayed innocent blood.&#8221;\n \n &#8220;What is that to us?&#8221; they replied. &#8220;That&#8217;s your responsibility.&#8221;\n \n 5 So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.\n \n 6 The chief priests picked up the coins and said, &#8220;It is against the law to put this into the treasury, since it is blood money.&#8221; 7 So they decided to use the money to buy the potter&#8217;s field as a burial place for foreigners. 8 That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day.\n \n These are tired old canards. Like I said previously, the internet is full of these rejoinders. I recommend you look these responses up before posting your alleged discrepancies in the fora.",

If one believes that it is wrong to say an employer purchased a meal for his staff, when it really was one of the employees who handed the money to the waiter, then the events recorded in Acts 1:18 could be considered fictitious. But what reasonable person would reach such conclusions as these?\n \n Acts 1:18 simply informs us that Judas furnished the means of purchasing the field. One is not forced to conclude that Judas personally bought the potter's field. As in modern-day writings and speeches, it is very common for the Scriptures to represent a man as doing a thing when, in fact, he merely supplies the means for doing it. For example, Joseph spoke of his brothers as selling him into Egypt (Genesis 45:4-5; cf. Acts 7:9), when actually they sold him to the Ishmaelites (who then sold him into Egypt). John mentions that \"the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John (though Jesus Himself did not baptize, but His disciples)\" (John 4:1-3). And when the Bible says, \"Pilate took Jesus and scourged Him\" (John 19:1), most people understand that he simply ordered Jesus to be scourged, not that he actually did the scourging himself. The same principle is recognized in law in the well-known Latin maxim, \"Qui facit per alium, facit per se\" (\"he who acts through another is deemed in law to do it himself\").\n \n Whether one says that Judas \"purchased a field with the wages of iniquity\" (Acts 1:18), or that the chief priests \"bought with them the potter's field\" (Matthew 27:7), he has stated the same truth, only in different ways.\"\n \n Apologetics Press - Who Bought the Potter's Field?\n \n Why is it called the \"field of blood\"?\n \n The Bible answers that in Matthew 27:\n \n 3 When Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he was seized with remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders. 4 \"I have sinned,\" he said, \"for I have betrayed innocent blood.\"\n \n \"What is that to us?\" they replied. \"That's your responsibility.\"\n \n 5 So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.\n \n 6 The chief priests picked up the coins and said, \"It is against the law to put this into the treasury, since it is blood money.\" 7 So they decided to use the money to buy the potter's field as a burial place for foreigners. 8 That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day.\n \n These are tired old canards. Like I said previously, the internet is full of these rejoinders. I recommend you look these responses up before posting your alleged discrepancies in the fora.\n\n \n And they are bad explanations. \n \n You say it's just a way of saying that Judas gave the money to the priests who then bought the field, but that doesn't make any sense in context. It says \n \n \nJudas bought a field; there he fell headlong\n\n \n Judas had to have been the one to actually purchase the field, because that is where he fell. If it was the priests who bought the field, Judas wouldn't have been there to die. \n \n This is in direct contradiction with Matthew:\n \n \nSo Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself. \n\n \n Judas threw the money down and left to go hang himself. It wasn't until he had left that the priests made the decision of what to do with the money. Judas was gone... it says he threw the money down and left to hang himself. Not 'Judas threw the money down, waited around until the priests decided to leave, followed them to the field and hanged himself.'\n \n And about why the field got that name, you are ignoring the Acts explanation:\n \n \n18 (With the payment he received for his wickedness, Judas bought a field; there he fell headlong, his body burst open and all his intestines spilled out. 19 Everyone in Jerusalem heard about this, so they called that field in their language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.\n\n \n That\\'s a completely different explanation... let me guess... both things led to the same nickname. Very weak.",
