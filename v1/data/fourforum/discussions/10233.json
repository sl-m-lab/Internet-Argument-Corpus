   "For anyone believing that over-political-correctness is not a real thing, here is a story that demonstrates that it really can and does get out of hand sometimes. \n \n \"A British clown has had the smile wiped off his face after being told he couldn't use balloons in his act because children might be allergic to latex. Barney Baloney said he was told by bosses at a supermarket where he was booked to appear that he should leave his balloons at home because of the potential for allergic reactions. The 47-year-old entertainer, also known as Tony Turner, has previously had to ditch his bubble-making machine because he could not get public liability insurance as companies assessed that youngsters might slip and hurt themselves. He said he was also told by one venue he could not twist balloons into the shape of guns for fear of encouraging youngsters to commit violence, although swords were deemed acceptable. \n \n \"At this rate I will have no act left. Things are going from crazy to ridiculous,\" Baloney, from Sheffield, northern England, was quoted as saying by the Yorkshire Post regional newspaper. \n \n \"This country is going crazy with its political correctness and health and safety issues and it's making us a laughing stock.\" \n \n A spokesman for the Tesco supermarket in Leeds where he was due to appear refused to back down: \"This is a health and safety issue. \"We have banned balloons because latex is used in the manufacture of them and this can trigger an allergic reaction in some children. We always have the welfare of children at heart.\"\n http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=070814122358.iyblgf2i&show_article=1",

   "To me this does not touch so much on political correctness as it does on what I call \"nannyism\". When I think \"political correctness\" I think of things like when we all pretend that the white teenager in a suit and ties is just as likely to be the perpetrator of an armed robbery as the black gang banger from the projects...or when we take knitting needles away from 85 yr old women while we ignore the guy with the turban and the tattoo on his forehead that says \"Born to martyr\". Basically, political correctness is when we will ourselves retarded when it comes to our interpersonal relationships.\n \n Nannyism is different, because in nannyism we assume that EVERYBODY else is retarded, and we have to lower everything to the lowest possible common denominator in order to keep all those XXXXXX breathing. Nannyism is the reason that we have to put anti natural selection labels on everything...because there may well be people out there who are so stupid that they would not realize that the fire from a blowtorch is HOT if there was not a notice that says \"Warning: flame is very HOT. Avoid contact with skin or flammable materials.\" Yep. It really says that on the side of my Benz-o-matic blowtorch.\n \n Nannyism is not particularly dangerous in and of itself. Where it gets dangerous is when we get to the point (where we are now) that people expect to be treated like XXXXXX, and feel like they should be compensated if somebody expects them to show even the tiniest bit of common sense. That is where we are at now, and where the problems in the article seem to stem from. Obviously a bubble machine is out of the question because people are too stupid to realize that bubbles are pretty much made of soap, and soap on the floor is slippery. Just putting up a sign would not be enough, because even if you warn people of the dangers, they cannot possibly be expected to be bright enough to react in a rational manner. Basically what it boils down to is trying to function within a society where people believe that they should be looked after and protected from all dangers from the cradle to the grave and courts that have been willing to legitimize this viewpoint. \n \n I bought a new hunting vest the other day for dove season because it looks like it is going to be HOT this year at the beginning of the season, and the only other hunting vests I have are pretty heavy (for upland bird season). The vest I got has a lightweight cotton back, and the front and the sides are cotton and nylon webbing. The tag inside says \"WARNING VEST WILL NOT STOP BULLETS\". In all caps, in bright red. Nannyism at its finest. \n \n As an aside...Personally I don't think that anybody who believes that a lightweight cotton and nylon mesh vest is going to stop bullets should be corrected. Not only do I not think they should be corrected, I think they should be encouraged to try it out. A little chlorine in the gene pool can be a good thing.\n \n Another thought...maybe this is the creationists fault. After all, if you really do not believe in the concept of natural selection, maybe you cannot see the disadvantage to breeding entire generations of XXXXXX.",

   "The problem daewoo is that people see the young black guy in baggy genes and an open shirt and automatically assume he is a gangster or other criminal. Likewise people assume that someone wearing a shirt with arabic writing on it is a terrorist, and generally can't tell the difference between a sikh turban and an arab headdress. Is it any wonder people get ###### off when they get stopped and searched by police 20 times in a year because of the colour of their skin (happens a lot in London)?",
