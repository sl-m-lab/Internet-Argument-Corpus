   "Study Finds Gay Men Earn Less\n http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15707842\n \n Weekend Edition Sunday, October 28, 2007 \u00b7 New research finds that gay men make less money than straight men. The same research shows that lesbians do not suffer similar job discrimination. Professor Bruce Elmslie of the University of New Hampshire's Whittemore School of Business and Economics speaks with Liane Hansen about the study.

   "If you can't access the audio link to the NPR interview, there's this article from Reuters: http://uk.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUKN2450662120071024 \nGay men can earn 23 pct less than married men: study\n \n NEW YORK (Reuters Life!) - Gay men, but not lesbians, face discrimination at work, earning up to 23 percent less than married men in some jobs, according to a new study.\n \n Researchers at the University of New Hampshire (UNH) Whittemore School of Business and Economics spent two years analyzing labor and wage data from 91,000 heterosexual and homosexual couples collected by a 2004 U.S. census.\n \n They found that gay men working in management and blue-collar jobs make less money than straight men due to discrimination by their employers\n \n \"It was surprising to see how consistent it was that gay men tended to be more discriminated against in traditionally heterosexual male dominated professions -- blue collar, labor, and management too,\" researcher Bruce Elmslie, professor of economics at UNH, told Reuters.\n \n The study found that gay men who live together earn 23 percent less than married men, and 9 percent less than unmarried heterosexual men who live with a woman.\n \n They looked at the top 10 occupations that gay men and lesbians tend to be in and found this discrimination showed up most clearly in management and blue-collar, male-dominated occupations such as building and grounds cleaning, maintenance, and construction.\n \n But Elmslie and co-author Edinaldo Tebaldi, who is now at Bryant University in Rhode Island, found that lesbians are not discriminated against when compared with heterosexual women.\n \n He said although negative attitudes toward lesbians could affect them, lesbians may actually benefit from the perception that they are more career-focused and less likely to leave the labor market to raise children than heterosexual women.\n \n According to the study \"Sexual Orientation and Labor Market Discrimination,\" which appears in the Journal of Labor Research, 18.1 percent of lesbians have children, compared with 49.4 percent of straight women. \n \n \"Employers could reasonably infer that a lesbian applicant or current employee will have a stronger attachment to the labor force than will a heterosexual woman,\" said Elmslie.\n \n The researchers cited a number of possible factors as to why gay men faced labor discrimination and lower wages in some industries.\n \n These included employers disapproving of gay lifestyles so not hiring gay men, concern that customers would not want to interact with gay men, and discrimination associated with AIDS and misunderstanding as to how HIV is transmitted or the loss of productivity if a worker became infected with HIV/AIDS.\n \n \"If employers perceive one group to be generally less productive or more costly than other groups, individual members of the negatively perceived group will receive lower wage offers regardless of their true characteristics,\" they said.\nAs to the frequency of the complaint, we used to hear it frequently on the old CNN and NYT boards, and it still crops up now and again. I believe it's #14 in the Lies You Can Spread About Gays Manual.",

Inquiring minds want to know!\n \n And was the \"gays make more\" myth really that common? I'd never heard that one until fairly recently on this forum.\n\n \n Yeah, this one has been floating around for years. I remember the religous reich always commeting on many news programs about the deep pockets of the gay community. Also, many marketing companies specifically target gay dollars because of their alleged \"disposeable income.\"\n \n Now, if we could figure out just who the \"closeted\" gays are, then perhaps we might be able to ask them. But since the word \"closet\" means someone is hiding, I think it's only logical that they would be a group that is impossible to survey, no?\n \n Maybe since more people are coming out now, there is a bit more realistic financial picture of homosexuals. Just a theory, but many homosexuals, in the past, have come out a little later in life when their lives were more established. Now, with the gay-friendly MTV generation making up a bigger part of the work population, we're starting to see a bit more of the whole picture. Just a theory.",

   "\"The study found that gay men who live together earn 23 percent less than married men, and 9 percent less than unmarried heterosexual men who live with a woman.\"\n \n Now that's interesting. From this we have to infer that unmarried heterosexuals who are living with their partner are also discriminated against, although not as badly as against gays. I'm wondering how much of this is anti-gay discimination per-se, as opposed to more of a pro-stability bias. Employers want their employees to lead stable lives, since drama at home tends to have a negative impact on work. I guess \"married\" = \"stable\" in many people's minds, reality to the contrary. :) Of course the fact that \"gay\" != \"stable\" to many people is anti-gay discrimination, I'm just surprised that unmarried straights didn't fare much better.",

Certainly if coming out runs the risk of getting fired then you're alot less likely to come out if you don't have a good chunk of change in the bank.",

   "You could also theorize that a reason lesbians are less discriminated against than gay men in the workplace--in addition to the theories mentioned in the article--is that the \"ick factor\" is so much less intense with lesbians. \n \n Certainly most of the anti-gay posters on this board seem fixated only on gay men and their alleged \"practices,\" while the total absence of complaint or even mention of what lesbiants do, along with the high frequency of lesbian sex scenes in hetero porn, suggests that few straight men have a problem with it.",

I believe it's #14 in the Lies You Can Spread About Gays Manual.\n\n \n I'm glad you posted this, because people regularly claim, as justification for continuing anti-gay discrimination, that gays are not discriminated against!\n \n One thing I would like to point out is that while lesbians may not be discriminated against in the workplace to the extent that gay men are, women still earn, on average, signicantly less than men do. The income of lesbians is compared in this study to the income of heterosexual women, and on average, that income is lower than that of men. Lesbians may still earn significantly less than heterosexual or even gay men do, on average. Also, many working heterosexual women have a male income contributing to their family's income, while lesbians do not. Lesbians often have another woman's income contributing to their family's income, and women's incomes are, on average, lower than men's. Lesbians may not be discriminated against in terms of pay for being lesbians, but they may be discriminated against, or receive lower pay than men, for being women. \n \n One factor in employment that may explain the higher pay of heterosexal married men is the \"just like me\" factor. It's an often unconscious rather than a conscious preference on the part of employers to hire and promote people who are \"just like me.\" We hire people regularly at my workplace, and I see this subtle form of discrimination, or preference, in operation all the time. Since most employers are married men, they may tend to hire and promote other married men, people who are just like them. This is probably unconscious. As different kinds of people become employers, they may still hire people who are \"just like me,\" but the people who are \"just like me\" may be women or minorities or gay people rather than heterosexual married men.",

   "As I recall, the original \"gays are wealthier than average\" meme came from a study some travel magazine that catered to the gay community made of its readership for its advertisers. Needless to say, gays who can afford to travel extensively are more likely to be wealthy and to read travel magazines.\n \n Duh! It's no surprise to find that gays on average might be poorer than straights on average. It's what I would expect.",
