   "Hey everybody, I've been away for almost a year now, but I've decided to come back here. I was watching the news alot lately, especially media coverage of the war in Iraq, democrats and republicans attakcing each other over the war in congress every day, and talking to a friend of mine at work who leans to the extreme left. And with July 4th being just yesterday, I was thinking about how this all is effecting America, where we're going, etc. I heard my friend talk about how we're mistreating detainees in Guantanamo Bay and torturing them and we're no better than the 'bad guys,' I've seen all the riots and such on the evening news, and I was thinking about the frenzy in the country when the Abu-Graib pictures came out, and I came to a sudden realization:\n \n If this is where our country is, where we tear ourselves apart for prosecuting a war (despite the fact that we are the most humane military ever to wage war), where we criticize our own people for making detainees and POWs uncomfortable while not seeeming to care about the barbarity inflicted upon our own soldiers...we deserve to lose. We deserve to be beaten, taken over, and assimilated. If this is where we are, we're a weak, sick nation, and we're soon to crumble into dust.\n \n But you know what? I had another epiphany: This isn't (yet) where our country is. Any time they interview a soldier from Iraq and Afghanistan and they speak with pride about what they're doing, it makes me feel good. Personally, I don't really care if Bush 'hyped the intel' or whatever prior to the war. Hey, he probably did. But the point is, we have hundreds of thousands of soldiers, marines, sailors, and airmen overseas, and whether people like it or not, they're doing good, and they're making a difference. And there are some people, thank god, who are genuinely ****** off about how we're treated around the world and don't think everything is our fault.\n \n Really, I don't know why I wrote this. I think I just wanted to let some thoughts out, maybe see what other people think, whatever. Have a nice day.",

Here's another question; where is your hatred for the people INTENTIONALLY killing innocents, huh? All I hear is you b*tching about the US.\n\n \n Nobody is targeting civilians. Both sides have adopted targets that have harmed civilains. The US has bombed in residential neiborghoods. We ahve used cluster bombs with penetrating, presssure sensitive munitions (basically land miones, though we pretend they are not). The Us has through the entire campaign used strategy tat kept US soldiers as safe as possible at the expense of the Iraqi civilain population. This was a politcal decision that was made at the begining of the war. Fewer flag draped coffins and grieving widows for the evening news means more support for the war state side. \n \n \nHow was the invasion of Iraq or Afghanistan illegal? The UN itself authorized the use of force against Saddam Husseins government. Can you tell me what international law was broken in the act of invading either of them?\n\n \n Read the UN charter. The war against Afghanistan was not illegal the war against Iraq was. The only time the UN approved of force against Saddam was during gulf 1. Following Gulf 1, a cease fire was signed. The cease fire was NOT with the US, it was with the UN, and the US did not, and does not, have the authority to declare Iraq in breach of it. The last resolution from the UNSC on IRaq warned of severe consequences for failing to comply. The iraqi governmetn provided thousands of pages, literally 25 truckloads, of documents to the UN. They also allowed unfettered access for the inspection team (which had mroe todo witht he fact that Blix promised saddam that if they finished inspections, he would not allow the US to add a bunch of other sites later).\n \n That final resolution was worded as it was specifically because the majority of security counil members were not comfortable with a resolution requiring military force. When the US decided to go to war, they drafted a new resolution that authorised use of force. When it became apparent that not only were some fo the permanent members ready to veto it, but that it was not even goign to be close to getting a majority vote, we withdrew the resolution and declared that we were going to war anyway.\n \n Under current international law, the only waty you can wage a war of agression is with approvl from the UNSC. We did not have that approval, and frankly any arguments to the contrary are both idiotic and delusional. I have heard it argued that the original resolution still gave us the authority to go to war. I ahve heard it argued thatt he sever consequences in the last resolution gave us the authority to go to war. If either of these was true, we would not have drafted and tried to pass the last resolution. \n \n Even the Bush administration quite arguing that we had any legal authority to go to war, instead arguing that we have a right, despite international law, to perform pre-emptive strikes against a nation that poses a clear and present danger to the US. First, they are wrong, and unfder international law, you specifically do NOT have such a right. Second, you would have to be an absolute XXXXX to believe that Iraq posed a clear and present danger to the US.\n \n \nThe problem is you have emotionally invested yourself in the ruling regime, in the American government, which makes it nearly impossible to make an objective assessment of the situation. The insurgents in Iraq are attacking \"us\", when a soldier talks about how he is doing good, you feel good. Like a fan of a soccer team, any attack on the US govt feels like an attack against you personally, and you feel compelled to defend them, whether they are right or not.\n\n \n absolutly correct.

They hide behind civilians, they use them as human shields. Read ANYTHING that has been written about the combat in Iraq and I will guarantee you it will talk about this.\n \n\n \n Everything I read about Iraqi resistance to US occupation has to do with just that. Suicide bombings are directed at Iraqis considered to be US collaborators; Iraqi police and police recruits are a primary target as are Iraqi army recruits, government officials and other civilians known to be sympathetic to the new, US constructed government. US troops are purposely kept away from most unsecured cities unless in the Green Zone or on a defined mission as their conventional war methodology makes them sitting ducks for unconventional warfare and US body counts are politically negative. \n \n If you remove emotion from your viewpoint and look at France during the German occupation during WW2, you'll recognize many of the same actions practiced by French resistance against an occupying military as you're seeing in Iraq. When the German military force occupying France tired of its conventional troops being killed almost at will by the French resistance, it announced it would kill ten randomly selected French citizens for each German soldier killed by the resistance. After discovering the Germans were serious, the resistance switched to killing members and supporters of the Vichy Government, all collaborators with the German occupation and mostly all civilians. But, as allies with France during that period, we cheered those actions.\n \n If you remove the 'right and wrong' context of your dislike for national resistance to military occupation in Iraq, you'll understand it's (resistance) nothing new in the world. If emotion is used to 'chose sides', then condemning Iraq resistance becomes no different than selecting a favored football team in that 'your' team can do no wrong while the opposition can be faulted for every action. Not very rational, but a common public reaction. \n \n Until Iraq is forced to deal with internal resistance on its own, for better or worse, nothing is going to change, including civilian 'soft target' deaths. We've assumed the role of nation builder and like parents preparing a child to enter society, only so much can be accomplished before that child is on its own. Iraq is similar to raising a child with identified multiple, conflicting personalities; good luck society in being able to cope with it on its own.",

Let me givce you and example.\n \n During the initial invasion, we accidentally bombed a convoy of refugees. Several busloads of Iraqis were killed. There were an estimated 600 civiklian casualties in 30 seconds. \n \n In bombing runs during the invasion, we bombed residentialk neiborghoods in Baghdad where military unit were expected to be hiding (turned out they were not). We killed over 1000 civilians in a single night there. \n \n How many car bombs that take out 20 civlians does it take to equal 1600 dead? A LOT, and those were just 2 examples.

The only exception is given in article 51:\n \n \nNothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.\n\n \n \n \n \n Besides, part of the cease fire resolution from the 1990-91 Gulf War specified that no Iraqi military unit was to engage any UN sanctioned force in the area pursuing the enforcement of the treaty. However, American and British warplanes over the no-fly zones were both targeted and fired at dozens of times in the 12 years between wars.\n\n \n Two problems with this. One, the US did not, and does not, have the authoruty to declare any nation in breach of any agreement with the UN or with a UNSC resolution. Only the security council may do that. Two, the no fly zones were not part fo the cease fire, nor were they approved by the UNSC. They were illegal projections of force by the US and the british. That is what he could get away with shooting at the planes. Strictly speaking, the planes were not part of the UN action, they were warplanes illegally in Iraqs airspace. We pushed for the UNSC to do something abotu him shooting at the planes once before and they were unwilling (in fact only the US and British were willing to support it at all) becuse the no fly zones were not UN mandates.\n \n \n Saddam kicked weapons inspectors out, more than once I believe.

He kicked the american members of the inspection team out becuase they were not inspecting for weapons, they were spying. Even the head of inspections at the time complained that it was difficult to get any inspections done because the staff ws so busy spying that they were not doing any inspecting. In the last report that Blix wrote tot he UN, his only complaint as far as Iraqs cooperation went was that they were having a disagreement about who should pay to erect a couple of radio towers, and who should provide air transport to different sites.",
