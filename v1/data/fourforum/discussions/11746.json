   "As I understand, the Second Amendment was written as a protection against political tyranny. The Founding Fathers knew that the King of England had used a standing army to oppress the people in the past. The solution was a well regulated militia and to not limit arms ownership to those in the military. However, because of big advances in military technology it's difficult to see how the kinds of arms typically owned by modern American gun owners would be very effective against the type of arms used by those in the armed forces. What use would a handgun be against a tank or F-16 Fighter plane? \n I think a lot of people are uncomfortable dealing with this issue so they choose to focus a lot on personal self defense against criminals instead of what the Second Amendment is mainly or solely about. We saw this in the recent Supreme Court decision. They chose to focus a lot on the role handguns could play in defending house and home against criminals, but seemed to have no problem with a ban on machine guns- the kind of guns that would logically seem to be most protected by the Second Amendment because of their usefulness in military conflicts which would make them a better deterrent against tyranny than other types of firearms.

   "This is a subject that is not very well understood by many people. While a prolonged conflict between the U.S. Military and the citizens would likely end in favor of the Government, There is a lot to be said for guerrilla warfare tactics. Our military is currently engaged in a war in which we are losing soldiers pretty much every day. This war is being fought in a country with a population of less than 28 million, and only a small percentage of this population is actively fighting our troops. This is partly due to the Rules of Engagement, in that we do not wish to simply carpet bomb the entire country or utilize CBR weapons that would cause the ruin of the entire land, as well as kill millions not engaged in the fighting. But it is also because of the tactics being employed by the enemy.\n \n Often, the goal of guerrilla tactics is not to be victorious in a large scale battle, but to slowly and constantly chip away at a force that is superior in number. It is very hard to defeat an enemy that you can neither identify or target effectively. Our country has millions of veterans that hold a great amount of knowledge with regard to military tactics, troop movement, communications, small unit planning and and a host of other topics. This knowledge, coupled with a proficiency in small arms can and has shown itself to be a very powerful weapon of war. \n \n It must also be considered that there will be a certain percentage of the military that would refuse to take action against their own people. While it is impossible to determine how many, I think it is likely that the number would be fairly large. \n \n A small group, armed with rifles commonly used for such things as hunting deer, possessing the knowledge above, can reek havoc on platoon strength units by engaging from distances that give the ballistic advantage to the guerrilla fighters, sniping if you will. Scavenging of equipment follows any engagement where it is possible, and then the turning of there own weapons against them on a small scale. By always shooting from cover, moving after no more than two shots and staying in cover, small groups have decimated larger military units many times. This is a tactic that our military teaches, yet seldom employs itself, and is similar to the tactics that were used by the Viet Cong, which proved to be very effective against our larger, better equipped forces.\n \n As I said at the outset of this post, it is likely that the US citizenry would not be victorious, however, the losses to the military are likely to be larger than many would anticipate, just as they have been in Iraq. The arming of the people can act as a deterrent to such instances though, and this is the true power held by the people as a result of the second amendment. An armed citizenry holds this single advantage over an unarmed citizenry. While it may be a small advantage, it is not one to be taken too lightly, nor is it one that should be relinquished at the whim of those in political office.\n \n Justin",

   "Well there were a number of thoughts I had when I first read through this thread. I admit I was tempted to immediately get into the argument over misconstruing the militia preamble policy statement so that it becomes the sole reason for the RKBA, for I feel this argument has become the tail attempting to wag the dog. I also thought about responding to the alleged futility of armed resistance, but I will limit myself to note my disbelief that a bunch of citizens armed with rifles and shotguns will march out into a field, form square like they are about to receive cavalry at Waterloo, and patiently await the B-52 strike. I am instead going to address the first thought that crossed my mind when I read the argument for the RKBA&#8217;s &#8220;irrelevance.&#8221; \n \n My first thought was that this argument on the alleged &#8220;irrelevance&#8221; of the individual RKBA is nothing more than a paraphrase of the very situation our founding fathers had sought to avoid&#8212;the creation of a standing army capable of threatening our liberties. Now I believe the intention of the militia clause of the 2nd. Amendment was to make the following very clear public policy statement: To preserve liberty we should rely upon militias and avoid standing armies. Many state constitutions already contained this public policy goal. See, for example, the Constitution of Virginia: \"that standing armies, in time of peace, should be avoided, as dangerous to liberty.\" This is why the militia preference preamble of the 2nd. Amendment reads militias as &#8220;being necessary to the defense of a free state&#8221;&#8212;that is, a state which need not fear the ambitions of a tyrant. \n \n And now we see the issue come full circle. The argument which starts this thread suggests that we can no longer defend ourselves should our professional armed forces turn upon us. You could paraphrase Patrick Henry and argue &#8220;the attempt would be madness,&#8221; and now suggest that the safety hazard outweighs any usefulness of the RKBA (based upon what I believe to be a mistaken assumption that the militia preamble is the sole justification for the right). I believe I understand the argument, even if I disagree with it. \n \n I disagree with the principle of this argument because I think it promotes encroachment on all our civil liberties. I trust everyone agrees that the Bill of Rights was drafted and ratified as a check on the power of the federal government. I think we have to look at the &#8220;irrelevant&#8221; proposal with this in mind, particularly if we accept the underlying premise of the argument. To re-paraphrase the argument as I understand it: The government has created&#8212;however contrary to the intent of and against all advice of the nation&#8217;s founders&#8212;the very instrument of potential tyranny they sought to avoid, and that it has now made that instrument so powerful that the citizen can no longer defend against its ability to oppress him. In short, we now live in freedom at the discretion of our military, and therefore we need to abolish the 2nd. Amendment since it is no longer probable that through its protection we could save ourselves. \n \n You know, this is a far better argument for reigning in our military establishment than one intended to support a total surrender to its potential power to tyrannize. \n \n But here is my fundamental problem with this argument. It does not limit itself to a claim that the government has already made an end-run around one of the rights intended to protect us. It also asks that we be meekly complicit in that act. To put it another way, it suggests we should not only allow the federal government to seek out opportunities to side-step restrictions on its power by creating situations in which it can claim the right restricting it is no longer relevant or safe. It goes further to suggest we should endorse this action&#8212;that our response should be to reward the government for this behavior by surrendering the right it now claims to have made irrelevant. \n \n How would such a reaction not encourage further encroachments upon our civil liberties? For me this is a dangerous argument to make at a time when we already see a government straining to justify holding people for years without trial or access to our courts. I for one am not in favor of encouraging the government to look for rights it thinks it can now avoid by declaring them irrelevant or too much of a safety hazard. \n \n ---\n \n \"False is the idea of utility that sacrifices a thousand real advantages for one imaginary or trifling inconvenience; that would take fire from men because it burns, and water because one may drown in it; that has no remedy for evils, except destruction. The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature. They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity, the most important of the code, will respect the less important and arbitrary ones, which can be violated with ease and impunity, and which, if strictly obeyed, would put an end to personal liberty--so dear to men, so dear to the enlightened legislator--and subject innocent persons to all the vexations that the guilty alone ought to suffer? Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man. The ought to be designated as laws not preventative but fearful of crimes, produced by the tumultuous impression of a few isolated facts, and not by thoughtful consideration of the inconveniences and advantages of a universal decree.\"--Thomas Jefferson, Commonplace Book, 1774-1776, quoting with approval 18th century criminologist Cesare Beccaria from his work, On Crimes and Punishment, 1764.",

It does not limit itself to a claim that the government has already made an end-run around one of the rights intended to protect us. It also asks that we be meekly complicit in that act. To put it another way, it suggests we should not only allow the federal government to seek out opportunities to side-step restrictions on its power by creating situations in which it can claim the right restricting it is no longer relevant or safe. It goes further to suggest we should endorse this action-that our response should be to reward the government for this behavior by surrendering the right it now claims to have made irrelevant. \n \n How would such a reaction not encourage further encroachments upon our civil liberties? For me this is a dangerous argument to make at a time when we already see a government straining to justify holding people for years without trial or access to our courts. I for one am not in favor of encouraging the government to look for rights it thinks it can now avoid by declaring them irrelevant or too much of a safety hazard. \n \n ---\n \n \"False is the idea of utility that sacrifices a thousand real advantages for one imaginary or trifling inconvenience; that would take fire from men because it burns, and water because one may drown in it; that has no remedy for evils, except destruction. The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature. They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity, the most important of the code, will respect the less important and arbitrary ones, which can be violated with ease and impunity, and which, if strictly obeyed, would put an end to personal liberty--so dear to men, so dear to the enlightened legislator--and subject innocent persons to all the vexations that the guilty alone ought to suffer? Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man. The ought to be designated as laws not preventative but fearful of crimes, produced by the tumultuous impression of a few isolated facts, and not by thoughtful consideration of the inconveniences and advantages of a universal decree.\"--Thomas Jefferson, Commonplace Book, 1774-1776, quoting with approval 18th century criminologist Cesare Beccaria from his work, On Crimes and Punishment, 1764.\n\n \n You made some sense until the part about abolishing the second amendment, and at that point you bagan to sound like the anti-gun side saying just turn in your guns, they are useless anyhow. I still believe a group of very inteligent armed citizens could defeat a standing army, yes there would probably be heavy casualties, and Im sure mistakes would happen, but the mistakes would happen on both sides. And as I posted earlier, capturing a modern tank would not be that difficult. The fact is that anything one man can concieve, another man can figure out how to get around it. Odds are just that, but they are not written in stone.",

   "As I understand, the Second Amendment was written as a protection against political tyranny. The Founding Fathers knew that the King of England had used a standing army to oppress the people in the past. The solution was a well regulated militia and to not limit arms ownership to those in the military. However, because of big advances in military technology it's difficult to see how the kinds of arms typically owned by modern American gun owners would be very effective against the type of arms used by those in the armed forces. What use would a handgun be against a tank or F-16 Fighter plane? \n I think a lot of people are uncomfortable dealing with this issue so they choose to focus a lot on personal self defense against criminals instead of what the Second Amendment is mainly or solely about. We saw this in the recent Supreme Court decision. They chose to focus a lot on the role handguns could play in defending house and home against criminals, but seemed to have no problem with a ban on machine guns- the kind of guns that would logically seem to be most protected by the Second Amendment because of their usefulness in military conflicts which would make them a better deterrent against tyranny than other types of firearms. Thus, the Supreme Court chose to \"strain at a gnat and swallow a camel\" to use a Biblical idiom in their treatment of the Second Amendment.\n\n \n First, you wouldn't use a handgun against an F-16 fighter plane. It's stupid and useless, but there are a lot of ingenious people out there that can probably prop up something to shoot one down, that's for sure. The second amendment is about self defense regardless of how big or small the threat is. I would think you would appreciate the ban on machine guns, since they are acknowledging that there is line to draw when it comes to it (like you can't own a fighter jet with military armament and just like the 1st Amendment you can't yell fire in a crowd.) Isn't this what most \"living document\" people say? Oh, I get it now? It's not about that is it? The fact of the matter is, you are dissatisfied that the line wasn't drawn to limit even more of it, i.e. a complete ban on firearms, only the national guard or armed forces should have them. Sorry, but if you were to do that, it would open up another can of worms in which would mean that all other confirmed rights could be limited even more. The SCOTUS did the right thing in this instance because they acknowledged there is a line to be drawn, but not the one that prohibits all law abiding citizens from owning firearm.",
