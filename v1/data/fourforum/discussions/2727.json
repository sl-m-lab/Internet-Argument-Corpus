   "(Disclaimer: This is for debate purposes only. It's not intended to offend. I did not see the movie \"Bowling for Columbine\" but I saw a review of it where this question was brought up, and I am bringing it up here. This issue may have already come up on this board while \"Bowling\" was still out.)\n -------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Apparently, in the movie Bowling for Columbine, Michael Moore paints the picture that the murder rates in the U.S. are the direct result of private gun ownership. If we controlled guns or outlawed their private ownership, the crime rates would drop to the average value of per capita murders among the nations of the world, according to what I read about the movie.\n \n Here was the question brought up by someone else:\n \n Black people make up ~12% of the total population of the U.S.\n http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/00000.html\n \n But, comprise <50% of murderers:\n http://www.murdervictims.com/murder_statistics.htm (1997 stats)\n \n If we removed these murders from the total number of murders, the number of murders in the U.S. would fall well below the average of per capita murders.\n \n What conclusions can we draw from this information?\n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Other stuff:\n Per capita murders: http://www.nationmaster.com/graph-T/cri_mur_cap\n GC in South Africa: http://www.codoh.com/newsdesk/9712002.HTML\n http://www.amadoo.com/eng/article.php?ama_prefix=ENG&aid=284\n http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3857163.stm\n some essay: http://www.lewrockwell.com/edmonds/edmonds39.html",

   "What MM fails to realize is that his opinions are not a documentary, but if you watch the movie there is a great cartoon that will show you the truth. All members of the NRA are members of the KKK. \n He danced around the issue of why there are \"so many\" murders, never dropping the blame anywhere, lots of maybes. watch the movie, it has reached cable, then you will know what he said..",

   "Moores implication that private ownership of firearms cause murder is not founded in any kind of reality. If that was actually the case, the areas of teh country that have the highest levels of firearms ownership would have the highest number of murders. This is not the case. You find the highest concentration of gun owners in rural America. You find the highest murder rate in urban america. \n \n Blackk commit not only the highest percentage of murders in the US of any single ethnic group, they commit the highest percentage of violent crimes overall. Whites, though, own porportionally more guns. \n \n I personally think that the problem of violent crime has a lot more to do with poverty and the steady decline we have seen in the black community over the last several years. Even under segregation, we saw a stronger black community that was not nearly so crime ridden (and no, I am not suggesting we should bring back segregation). The black community has simply self destructed. \n \n Instead of trying to help the black community to rebuild, we have made excuses for them and tried to make them feel better about themselves without having to actually be better. Instead of pushing for proper english, we started teaching Ebonics in schools. This is nice, but you get some kid who, his whole life, has not ever learned to speak proper english and send him out to find a job, and you will quickly find that you have done him a major disservice. \n \n Instead of targeting the black community for drug intervention programs, since they have a major drug problem in the black community, we have been certain not to make it appear that we are targeting the blacks for fear that it will portray them as crack heads. \n \n Basically, we have done an EXCELLENT job of turning an ethic minority into a bunch of criminals. \n \n This is just my opinion. Others feel taht it is becasue blacks are genetically inferior. Personally I don't believe this.",
