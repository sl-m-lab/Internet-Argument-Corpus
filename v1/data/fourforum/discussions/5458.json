   "Cuba has many problems, like that was news. Cuba is broke, again, duh! The flipside is that despite embargoes, and constant pressure from the US, Cuba has (just) enough food, good healthcare and education. Compared to other societies that lived under embargoes for less time, such as Iraq, it does amazingly well. Cuba has also exported trained docters to help all over latin america. Cuba would be better off under a democratic government and without the US constantly on its back, but the current communist dictator is better than the old right wing one, or alternatives from South America like Pinochet.",
