I don't know you, I've never crossed paths with you (I hope anyway), and I haven't been on another forum. I also have never said that \"Republicans are for gay people.\" I know they often don't view gay people's relationships as moral, and that's one reason I identify with them. Your statements about not being able to find a single post where I don't deride gay people is so ridiculous and over the top, it's ludicrous.

   "To be honest this is the first time I've really thought that much about gay adoption. It's not that I'm afraid to say I support it or not--it's just that I haven't ever debated that particular issue (maybe a comment or two, I don't know). It's something I'll have to look at both sides and think through.\n\n \n I believe we got turned onto the subject because so many anti's claim that marriage is about families and raising children. The fact still remains that gays/lesbians do raise families, whether adopted, foster or biological. \n As I pointed out, with a link to back up my assertation, gays and lesbians have been adopting and fostering for many years. Whether closeted to themselves, the foster agencies or adoption agencies. I happen to agree that the reason why it's only come up resently (which also must be pointed out that recently includes the whole \"Rosie O'Donnell\" fight to save a well adjusted family situation in Florida...) is because of the whole \"gay marriage\" issue. \n \n \n \nI don't know what's hypocritical about wanting to protect the institution of marriage. Apparently you'd rather me be completely against you than acknowledge the need of gay people for couples' benefits.\n\n \n Again, and again, and again, it has been pointed out to you, to no avail, that the \"institution\" of marraige is in fact a governmental construct. Not to mention that what really is the downfall of marriage is DIVORCE, not MORE MARRIAGE! That's just backwards thinking.",
