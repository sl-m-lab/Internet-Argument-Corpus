   "Obama (as usual) will surrender; the entire Bush tax cuts will be extended.\n \n The U.S. OMB advises the President and the U.S. CBO advises the congress. The function if those government offices are to perform research and analysis with regard to the federal budget. Despite supply-siders' contrary opinions, federal tax reductions without accompanying spending reductions generally increase our federal budget deficit more than otherwise.\n \n I advocate the president determine how much increase, (based upon the OMB's estimate regarding any tax reduction bill passed through congress), of federal deficit he's willing to accept due to a tax reduction bill. He should announce that he will not sign a bill that exceeds that finite amount. The president should not budge from that position. The entire Bush tax cuts will then remain expired until the Republicans agree to compromise or until 2013.\n \n After the Democrats failed to bring the tax bill onto the floor of both houses prior to the 2010 elections, I voted for the Green Party. If all available candidates for federal office had been unacceptable, (i.e. Democratic or right wingers), I would have abstained from voting.\n \n I won't vote for Democrats until they find and retain their courage.\n \n Respectfully, Supposn",
