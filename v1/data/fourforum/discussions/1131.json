   "The debate on homosexual rights is one that is continuous in our lives. One sees it in advertisements, on the newspaper, and often taking place in our own homes. However, we never get a clear understanding on the issue, and because of this many of us become very closed-minded on the issue and fail to address it correctly. It isn't just Christians who address it incorrectly; the homosexuals themselves often misunderstand their very own lifestyle! Because of these misunderstandings, I felt that I should address the issue. I have learned a great deal in Psychology, most likely because both of my parents are Psychologists, although my mother is not practicing. I also have been exposed to homosexuals- after all, I live in the most populated gay city in the nation, San Francisco. I have several issues I feel compelled to point out, mostly correcting misconceptions and errors people make.\n \n The more difficult people to address are Christians. Devout Christians generally do not accept the gay community. One could understand the reason- their religion prohibits it. It is not uncommon to find a Christian fundamentalist on the streets of the Castro District* preaching to the homosexuals to repent from their sinful lives. Why are Christians so intolerant to homosexuals? Why aren't they intolerant to Hindus or polygamists? The reason is, homosexuals live a very vocal life. Christians do their best to not have their children be exposed to such a life they call sinful. I can certainly understand this- children are often way to young to understand sexuality. When I was anywhere from six to ten I was forced to listen to homosexuals talk about their sexuality and persecutions at school. I learned about the terms \"faggot\" and \"dike\". Further, I was almost brainwashed. I understand that this wasn't of all of the homosexual's faults- it was obviously the faults of some homosexuals who were closed minded. I know many homosexuals who are not like this. The Christians in return to exposing their children to this life of \"sin\" do what they do best; preach, and force it down your throat until you vomit it all out. Christians must be compassionate towards homosexuals; they must be forgiving. As a Catholic, I understand that homosexual behavior is a sin. However, this doesn't compel me to preach and persecute them, this more compels me to do what Christ did- I ask, \"What can I do to help them?\". \n \n First, we must understand the origins of homosexuality. Homosexuals have probably been around since early humans, though we don't have a lot of concrete evidence for it. We assume there have been homosexuals for all ages as the psychology of the human brain has only changed through changing times, but homosexual psychology (which I will shortly explain) has not. The most common misconception is that homosexuals are born gay. This is not so. Nobody's conceived gay, and further, nobody is born straight. An infant isn't going to look at another infant and feel sexual attraction for it, an infant honestly only feel attraction for his mother's breasts (no, not sexually). Sexuality doesn't pick up until shortly after the first adolescence. We can all remember our childhood crushes. I remember when I was five having a crush on this girl named Jamie. This is shortly after the second adolescence (there are three- the first takes place when you are two, the second when you are three or four, and the third when you're around 12, also known as puberty). I wouldn't say my attraction toward Jamie was sexual- I honestly didn't know anything about sex at that age. To me, sex was French kissing. It is not until the third adolescence that you begin to have sexual attractions. At this age, you understand a bit more about sex, and many times want to partake in it. Hence, homosexuality probably begins at the childhood, but doesn't clearly develop until puberty.\n \n How does homosexuality develop? There are many theories, and it is still not known. The most likely is that the child develops it from lack of balance of the parents. This can be anything- the father or mother could be gone a lot, or there can be a lack of a parental figure. Many times it doesn't even seem like there's a lack. The truth is there often is, but nobody knows it. For instance, if a male child spends a lot of time with his female mother, he will develop a lot of characteristics that his mother has, sexually and not. For instance, when I was young I spent a lot of time with my father. My father absolutely loved muffins, and I soon grew to love muffins as well. I may have not liked them at first, but seeing that my parental figure liked it compelled me to eat the food as well and soon I grew into liking it. A more direct example that compares to homosexuality is if a child spends too much time with one parental figure, and not enough with the other. Let's use Emily for an example, who is a typical case of a child's development of homosexuality. Emily is a seven-year-old American. She loves her dad. During the time she gets off from school, her mother leaves to work, so Emily gets to spend time with her father. Emily copies her father (as most children do), and does everything he does. Soon Emily realizes that spending time with men could be a lot more fun then spending time with other girls. So, she becomes a tom-boy, in that she spends a lot of time with boys. But boys do boy things, and as they get older have sexual attraction towards girls. Emily doesn't know what to make of it, and since her mother is busy with work she only can speak to her father about it, which she doesn't want to do. So she ignores it, but soon she feels the same attraction for females as her male friends do, and thus becomes homosexual. Although this is not always the case, this is a case that happens most often. Often, homosexuals come from a perfect family background. Other times, they are molested and are confused about their sexuality. Homosexuality, hence, is not a disease, is not a mental illness, but is simply a child living in a different childhood. \n \n What is a Christian to do? Obviously, homosexual behavior is a sin. We must be compassionate. The Catholic Church has a group called Courage, where they do not use the terms \"straight\", \"gay', \"lesbian\", or even \"homosexual\" as they are distractions and discriminating. They believe that since we are all people, that is the only importance that we must discuss. Further, they believe that if homosexuals want to live a pure life they can in Christianity. I think that many times homosexuality is a gift. I believe that many saints were homosexual. It's a gift that God gives to his children so that they could love him more. Everyone is called to be saints, and if you must struggle with homosexuality, so be it!\n \n *The Castro District is a heavily populated homosexual community in San Francisco. During Vietnam and the Gulf War, many homosexuals tried to join the military but were denied because they were open about their sexuality, and were denied to join and were kicked out at the Alameda base (for good reasons! The military tries to seperate men and women so that nobody is distracted!). The homosexuals moved to San Francisco's Castro disctrict because it was all they could afford.",

   "Oh, Parcum. Really, you can't do any better than this?\n \n If this theory were the case, there would not exist a single homosexual whose family did not follow this pattern. Therefore, suffice to find one single homosexual with present, het, opposite-gendered straighter than straight parents to completely disprove this theory. Unlucky for you, scores of such people exist. Not to mention the number of families that have both gay and straight kids. Also, generally speaking, before a psychological theory should get any degree of acceptance or recognition, it must be tested. Do you have any competent studies to back up this theory? All evidence I've seen points to the contrary:\n \nSuffice it here to note that there are severe problems with these theories in their own right (for instance, they cannot explain many cases of homosexuals without dominant mothers and absent fathers, they cannot explain why many children of dominant mothers and absent fathers are heterosexual, and they ignore the logical problem of causality, which states that a real possibility, for the cases where dominant mothers and absent father are a reality, that homosexuality - or some characteristic correlated with homosexuality, such as, possibly, effeminacy - precedes that situation and actually causes it). But in addition, they do not incorporate the recent scientific findings that imply that there is a genetic element to homosexuality (see The Gay Gene and the book XXXXX Science: The Use and Abuse of Research into Homosexuality by Dr. Simon LeVay (Boston: The MIT Press, 1996)). What determines someone's sexual orientation is thus a very complex issue, and only to base one's analysis of this phenomenon on a subset of the theories must be considered highly irresponsible and unscientific. \nwhole article here \n \n The problem with getting your info from people like ALL, is that it isn't accurate or current information.\n \n \nThe Catholic Church has a group called Courage\n\n \n Aww, I know so many people who met girlfriends/boyfriends in groups like those... ;) They're cute.

WAAAAY off topic, but may have some sense.... \n \n \n This will be slightly off subject too, but I will try to relate it back for you. You know that thing about getting sick walking around outside with too little clothing on in the winter, or catching a cold if you don't dress warm enough...it is complete XXXX. You don't catch colds from being outside in cold weather, walking around in bare feet, getting wet in the cold...etc. You catch colds from viruses and bacteria. The reason that you will find far more sick people when the weather is cold is due to the fact that everyone stays indoors, windows and doors stay closed, and bacteria and viruses proliferate in these environments. The old \"you'll catch a cold if you don't put that coat on\" argument that my mother gave to me for years came about because people did not know any better. They said \"hmm, it's getting cold outside and now everyone seems to be getting sick...therefore...cold weather must cause people to get sick. \n \n Why do I mention this. Well, it seems fundamental to the homosexual argument. People have an overall lack of education on the subject, so a lot of misinformation is out there, and a lot of misconceptions. At present there is no definative answer whether or not homosexuality is genetic, learned, or a combination of both. Instead of attempting to make the arguments one way or another, we should strive to educate ourselves, and perhaps in the process we will learn the answer and throw the misconceptions aside. You can see that it is easy for someone to think something true just because that is what they have always heard or been told. Knowing the facts and truely educating yourself is the best way to truely understand something. I in no way intend to insult anyone on this board, but ignorance and misconception about homosexuality is rampant, and the majority of people should seek to educate themselves prior to perpetuating these misconceptions.

   "Being a homosexual I feel qualified to speak on the topic. My sister and I were raised by my mother, a very feminine heterosexual woman. I was raised in a middle class Baptist family and I had a great example of a loving, traditional marriage in my grandparents who provided nurturing and support to my mother my sister and myself. I never met a homosexual until I was an adult. I wasn't even even aware of what the word meant or that it had a negative connotation until long after I felt my first inklings of attraction towards females. I am very feminine, and started wearing makeup in the 5th grade at least 3 years after I began feeling drawn towards girls. I took ballet for 8 years and I love to shop. I do not play sports nor am I particularly interested traditionally masculine pursuits. I have always had both male and female friends. My sister is married to pastor. \n My partner of 10 years was raised by her mother and father in a very loving traditional home. Her parents are still completely in love and devoted to each other. Both of her parents are marriage and family therapists. She is very feminine, wears makeup and designer clothes although she does enjoy watching football whenever possible.

   "didnt he say its *most likely* parental imbalance, and that there are many causes?\n\n \n In Parcum's opinion it is the most likely, unproven theory. The example of Emily may be that of a \"tomboy\" lesbian, who preferred to be with dad and males, but there are plenty of feminine and \"lipstick\" lesbians around. They learned to do \"girly\" things, probably by being with their mother, and with other women and girls, and they are still lesbians. There are gay men I know who are really into fixing up cars, which they probably learned from being around dad and males. Perhaps Emily enjoyed doing \"manly\" things and to be around men, by forces which had nothing to do with her sexual orientation. Not all the variables have been examined.

   "2 Spike\n \nYou don't have to be Christian to understand right and wrong. \n \n I wasn't saying that. Actually I do believe that everyone can determine what's write and wrong because it's already a built-in feature of every person. So I guess you misunderstood my point.\n \n \nNo, it is wrong. Judgement is for God, not for a sinner. There's a reason Jesus commanded you not to judge. So if you're just going to defy Jesus's commands to blatantly, I think you're in the wrong religion. \n \n There is a difference between judging individuals (such as, condemtning them to punishment, like judges in a court) and judging about wrongs these individuals do. You mean judging in a way that I say \"You are a homosexual, you are worthy of a death penalty\". I mean it in the way \"Homosexuality as a social phenomenon, and as a problem of an individuals life is wrong and not acceptable\".\n \n \nYou can't love a person, and hate who they are. \n \n You can't like a person and hate who he or she is. But you can still love this person. Like you love yourself. You don't nessessarily like yourself at times, and sometimes you even hate yourself, but you still care for yourself, and don't just let yourself starve to death just because you feel guilty of something or feel that you are a bad person. This is C.S. Lewis' argument. I think it applies here.\n \n \nTreatment?! Homosexuality isn't some disease that you just take a pill for and BOOM, all better. It's a part of you. It's no more treatable, or \"cureable\" than heterosexuality. \n \n I agree. But do you agree something must be done about it? Or you just let is spread?\n \n \nSee it however you want, but the fact is, it's not like those illnesses you listed. Homosexuality hurts no one. AIDs and high blood pressure tend to kill you.\n \n If it's not a problem and does not hurt anyone, then why is it still considered anti-social in most countries? Why is it an issue anyway, and why are we discussing this, if we all believe it's all right? And not only christians are against homosexuality, most normal people are. Would you teach your son to become a gay? No, I don't think so. Because inside everyone knows it's wrong. But if you are one, you just want to protect yourself and find excuses for yourself, and justify yourself. It's like smoking - you probably know it's not good for you, but you can't quit smoking, so you find good reasons to do it in order to feel better about doing something wrong.\n \n \nDefine natural.\n\n Natural comes from a root word \"nature\". What do you see in the nature? Under normal circumstances you don't see homosexuality as a part of a nature, like, in lives of animals, etc.\n \n \nA. Homosexuality doesn't hurt anyone, hence your comparison is tragically flawed. \n \n B. You don't \"catch\" homosexuality...\n\n My argument is that the number of homosexuals is growing, and their influence on the society is also growing. So it does spread. And that means also that you can, in a way, catch it. Not like flu or HIV, but if you are exposed to this phenomenon and if you are brainwashed about how \"normal\" it is, you are more likely to \"catch\" it.\n \n \nYou're the type of person Parcum was talking about. You really need to go learn the facts about homosexuality.\n\n You sound like you want to prove to me that I have to do it and explore it as another life form or something. No, I don't agree with it. I don't need to learn facts. These facts sound like self-justification to me.\n \n \nGays are people too, ya know. They're not lepers, they don't pose a threat to society. And there is no good reason why we should discriminate against them. \n \n Well, not \"discriminate\", but not let them affect and influence others. Surely I am not saying they are lepers. I didn't mean literal \"reservation\" or \"concentration camp\" for them, but you don't have to let them spread the idea of this lifestyle on to others. And do it massively and openly.\n \n \nJesus was about love, and peace, and forgiveness, yet all you seem capable of is hatered and ignorance. \n \n Please, don't take me wrong. I don't hate people like that. As well as I don't hate people who have cancer. I'm just saying that we have to address it as a Abnormal vs Normal.\n \n \nHow is it corrupting society? I mean really, drop your paranoid dilusions for a minute, and actually look at the facts.\n\n What are the facts? Also, prove to me how this actually helps the society.",

Here we are talking about an active promotion of the homosexual lifestyle, and it's promoted by mainstream channels, celebrities, etc. So we ARE talking about a constant growth. \n \n \nWhy are we debating if there is a general agreement that homosexuality is wrong?\n\n Well truth has always been debated. Peoples minds are now twisted more then ever, so it won't be a surprise if homosexuality will be allowed and encouraged in more and more countries.\n \n \nHow would one do this?\n\n By saying, \"Son, it's okay if you like boys instead of girls, you are just the way God made you\", by teaching him that it's alright. Help me think here, there definitely are many more ways.\n \n \nNo, everyone does not know it is wrong.\n\n Usually when it comes to you, when you are an object of wrong words or actions, you do know they are wrong, to you.

How can you make generalizations that an entire class of people who are different than you are just trying to make excuses for themselves or justify themselves, simply because they belong to a particular class of people?\n \n Well, there are different types of being \"different\". (Please don't take the following comparison personally, I use it to prove my point). Child malesters, rapers, maniacs are also three different groups of people. But we do have another attitude to them. We don't justify their actions. And in this case, there's no discrimination to them, simply justice.\n \n \nI don't know that homosexuality is bad for me.

It the Bible it's listed among other sins which are generally agreed to be wrong, which I believe you also agree with according to the above quote. It's just that you select to not put homosexuality on the same list with other wrong stuff, because then you's have to say no to it.\n \n \nNo, I can't say I know everything. I can learn by others through their good arguments. So far, I haven't heard any good arguments from you about why you believe homosexuality is wrong or harmful. Do you believe you know everything?\n\n Well, that's too easy to turn my question against myself. No, I don't know everything. So well, if none of us does not know everything, then we don't we say \"End\" to this instead of writing in this forum? See, you are here probably because you are still looking. Or at least wanting to protect your kind. I am here but I'm not seeking. Neither I am here to attack you or fight with you. I just want to share my conviction. \n Now tell me. You say that so far you haven't found here any good arguments against homosexuality. My question is now - if you will find these arguments, what will you do? Repent? I am not kidding. I am asking you about your attitude. Are you now humble enough to sincerely quit it once you know it's wrong?\n \n \nIt is not just homosexuals who are not against homosexuality.\n\n Others (the ones who are not homosexuals and are not against homosexuality) just don't care. If you ask them, they'll probably tell you that they never thought about it. It's really common: \"Well, if it works for you then it's good\". \n \n \nAgain, you use the term normal without defining it. \n \n Okay, first of all, I use this term \"normal\" for the majority of people. They are not homosexuals.\n \n \nDo you have scientific research that proves t.v. or computer games make a person, already secure with heterosexual identity, gay? There are many things presented on TV. I watched Sister Act, but it didn't make me a nun. \n \n I don't have data on hands. And I wasn't talking exclusively about homosexuality issue. My point was that TV does affect how people think and act. Did you hear about cartoons in Japan, how kids became crazy after watching some of them? Ask any psychiatrist and he will tell you that television does affect people's thinking.\n \n \nWe are not talking about \"facts\" here. It is possible that the number of open gay people is growing.\n\n I believe so.\n That's why it's an issue and that's why we are discussing it.\n \n \nI've not been convinced that in itself, being gay or lesbian or bi-sexual, or simply acting on those orientations, is a problem.\n\n So give me a reason to belive that it's perfectly normal.",

   "Actually you know, the majority thinks the same. So \"all those\" are not the majority.\n\n Well, we all know that the \"majority\" are always right! emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nWell I agree, there is not one. \n You know what, if I wasn't a believer, I wouldn't care as long as my children are not exposed to homosexuality and not influenced by their lifestyle.\n\n Thank goodness that despite you, your children will be exposed to messages that being gay is ok, even fabulous!\n \n I hope you mature enough as a person to be able to love your children for who they are, not who you want them to be... \n \n \nBut because of being a believer, I hold on to the truth of the Bible, which names homosexuality a sin. \n\n Better burn a clean animal, because the smell makes the Lord happy! You don't read the Bible much, do you?\n \n \nNow tell me. You say that so far you haven't found here any good arguments against homosexuality. My question is now - if you will find these arguments, what will you do? Repent? I am not kidding. I am asking you about your attitude. Are you now humble enough to sincerely quit it once you know it's wrong?\n\n I think I would. Of course, I can say that because I know that it isn't wrong, so I'm in no danger of having to change at all. ;)\n \n \nOkay, first of all, I use this term \"normal\" for the majority of people. They are not homosexuals.\n\n And the majority of people don't regularly attend church, or have red hair. I suppose \"abnormal\" people who are churchgoers or have red hair should be chastised as well, for being so \"abnormal\". \n \n There's no churches in nature, either. So, I guess to bring back JakeCBJ's point, people who are married are unnatural, and people who attend church are abnormal. White people are a minority, and redheads are abnormal as well. \n \n Words like \"abnormal\" and \"unnatural\" are completely meaningless- they're just a way to insult things or people you don't like but have no substancial or reasonable argument against.\n \n \nDid you hear about cartoons in Japan, how kids became crazy after watching some of them?\n\n Lol... \n \n \nSo give me a reason to belive that it's perfectly normal.\n\n Burden of evidence is on you. You're the one who says it's a problem. Aside from Biblical point-and-quote, do you have a specific argument which can demonstrate any problem with homosexuality or any other non-het behavior?",
