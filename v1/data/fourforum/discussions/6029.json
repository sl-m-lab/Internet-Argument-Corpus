   "Self induced delusions. It's a lifelong challenge within one's self to convince one's self of the obviously impossible. The resulting product is called faith. I think the dopamine theory isn't far off either. Some people get extreme emotional highs from religion, especially within the charismatic movements.\n \n It's also group therapy. It's an oppertunity for believers to gather and reinforce their delusional fantasies with each other. It's a crutch to overcome the fear of death as well. For the most part it's harmless unless taken to the extreme. However, it can be rather obnoxious. But the purpose it serves in some people makes it a valuable commodity I suppose.\n \n Myself, I do not require the religious masquerade. Truth and reality suit me just fine. emoticon_idea",
