   "From the Spain Herald \n \n Bono: Eliminate \"war\" from Spanish constitution\n Defense minister Jose Bono yesterday backed the possibility of removing the three references to the word \"war\" from the Spanish constitution before Parliament's defense committee. The first reference, in article 15, says, \"The death penalty is abolished except under military law during wartime.\" Bono said that this question is already dealt with in the military criminal code. The second reference is in article 63.3; it reads, \"The King has power, under previous authorization from the Cortes (both houses of Parliament), to declare war and make peace.\" Bono's reply was that since Spain belongs to the United Nations, the King cannot declare war and the Cortes cannot authorize it. According to the UN, \"resorting to war to resolve conflicts is prohibited.\" Bono emphasized that \"this has more to do with literature than legality.\" He also mentioned the UN and the San Francisco charter when he referred to article 169, which states, \"Constitutional reform cannot be initiated during wartime.\" Bono supported these modifications by declaring, \"What is not useful and besides is against international law, it might be a good idea for us to modify. This is only my opinion, and it might be overruled.\" This particular proposal is not part of those suggested in the plan to modify the constitution sent by the Council of State to the administration. \n \n \n so this is how Spain's sovereignty is to die? not a shot to be fired. \n if this happen, they've outdone the French ;)\n \n what kind of idiot defense minister would say such a thing?",
