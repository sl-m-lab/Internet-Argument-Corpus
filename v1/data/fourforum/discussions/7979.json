   "That religion has been responsible for a great deal of suffering in this world is pretty much a commonplace observation. And people say that religious beliefs have done more harm than good, but there's no way of proving it.\n \n But let's focus on Christianity.\n \n It can't be denied that the history of Christianity is sometimes a shocking record of persecution, torture, and massacre. However, the intellectual enlightenment and the advance of science have made it possible to believe that secular rationalism could depose religious authority, and perhaps confine Christianity to the margins of society or to the private sphere where it could not harm the public interest.\n \n So let's suppose that a secular program of humane enlightenment succeeded in eliminating the Christian religion from the public domain and in reducing it to the status of a mere hobby, would the world (meaning Western society) then be a 'better place'? \n \n For the following reasons, I'm not sure that it would.\n \n First; we have to remember that religious wars, persecution of heretics, oppression of minorities, etc., which have been directed in the name of Christianity could be attributed to the pitiless cruelty that is in the nature of man and which religious precepts have been unable to mitigate.\n \n Second; it could be argued that the injustice and wickedness for which Christian zealots are to blame, is in defiance of Christian moral restraints and persuasions. And that in the absence of those restraints and persuasions, the history of the last 2000 years would have been an even worse chronicle of horrors. \n \n If we imagine a de-Christianized society without the moral teaching of Jesus and the restraints of the Ten Commandments - to which a large number of people still pay some attention - would it really be a safer, happier, and more tolerant community?",

And people say that religious beliefs have done more harm than good, but there's no way of proving it.\n\n \n From an anthropological, or perhaps sociobiological, perspective, religious belief has been a key part of human culture for as far back as we can see. From that point of view, the argument that religion has 'done more harm than good' is a futile one. Humankind would simply not, I suspect, have got where it is today without it. It was never necessary that religious beliefs had any foundation in reality: the benefits they conferred on societies were independent of what their practitioners actually believed or worshipped. There can be little doubt that emerging societies were greatly strengthened by the unity of purpose that a tribal religion gave them, and by the sanctification it conferred upon rules and customs that increased the group's fitness. The Old Testament is witness enough to that.\n \n The question now is whether it is still a useful and adaptive component of culture, or whether its usefulness is over.\n \n \nBut let's focus on Christianity ...

   "Georgia OKs Bible Classes, Commandments \n By SHANNON McCAFFREY, Associated Press Writer \n \n ATLANTA - Georgia became what is believed to be the first state to offer government-sanctioned elective classes on the Bible, with Gov. Sonny Perdue signing a bill into law Thursday. \n \n The governor also signed a bill permitting the display of the Ten Commandments at courthouses, an issue that has raised thorny constitutional questions.\n \n Critics say the measures blur the line between church and state. National civil rights groups said they want to see how the laws are implemented before deciding whether to challenge them in court.\n \n The Bible is already incorporated into classes in Georgia and other states, and some local school districts have passed measures permitting classes devoted solely to the Bible. But education analysts say the law in Georgia is the first time a state government has endorsed such courses.\n \n The new law allows elective classes on the Bible to be taught to high school students. Local school systems will decide whether to teach the courses.\n \n The state Education Department has until February to craft curriculums. The law requires that the courses be taught \"in an objective and nondevotional manner with no attempt made to indoctrinate students.\"\n \n The state's new Ten Commandments law was prompted by controversy over the posting of the commandments at the Barrow County Courthouse. A federal judge ordered the display removed in July.\n \n Backers of the law made clear they were trying to craft a statute that would survive any constitutional challenges.\n \n In a split decision last June, the U.S. Supreme Court declared exhibits of the Ten Commandments constitutional if their main purpose was to honor the nation's legal, rather than religious, traditions, and if they didn't promote one religious sect over another.\n \n Both bills passed the state Legislature by comfortable margins.\n \n (Yahoo News)\n \n Gotta love it!",

His thesis is that unless institutional Christianity rethinks and reforms some of its traditional doctrines to fit 21st century sensibilities, it will become increasingly irrelevant, especially within the developed world. It goes without saying that many conservative/fundamentalist Christians do not like this guy. \n \n Were this to occur (a gradual reduction of Christianity to the level of irrelevancy), would society be better off? Interesting question. I'll offer one perspective based upon my own observations: more than a few conservative/fundamentalist Christians with whom I've interacted are of the opinion that there is no point in preserving-protecting the earth's environment, given that the 'end times' are just around the corner. They will go to considerable length to explain that \"all the signs are in place\", and that efforts at environmental protection are therefore pointless.

Religion diminishes into a matter of personal salvation - important perhaps to the individual, but of little consequence to society at large.\n\n \n This is very much the nub of the matter, I think. The aspect of religion that has most obviously declined in secular societies like much of western Europe is precisely that associated with public display/declaration of conformity and shared values - going to church. A far greater proportion of our compatriots, I suspect, would if asked claim to 'believe in god' than would claim regular church attendance. Religion as repository of common values does seem to be giving way to religion as personal set of pick'n'mix preferences.",

   "Ret. Episcopal Bishop John Shelby Spong has written a number of books on the subject of contemporary Christianity, and you can get an idea as to where he's coming from by simply reading some of the titles, as in Rescuing The Bible From Fundamentalism or Why Christianity Must Change Or Die. His thesis is that unless institutional Christianity rethinks and reforms some of its traditional doctrines to fit 21st century sensibilities, it will become increasingly irrelevant, especially within the developed world. It goes without saying that many conservative/fundamentalist Christians do not like this guy.\n\n \n I wonder why?\n \n http://www.christian-apologetics.org/html/Whats_wrong_Spong.htm\n \n Spong the (ahem) Greek \"scholar\"\n \n Spong boasts that he spends hours studying the Bible and professes an acquaintance with Koine Greek, the language the NT was first written in. Therefore it is not surprising that in RMR, where he denies Jesus' bodily resurrection, that he turns to an analysis of the Greek text to see what the Bible really means.\n \n In RMR p. 53-55, Spong draws our attention to Gal. 1:15-16a which says:\n \n v15 But when He who had set me apart, even from my mother's womb, called me through His grace, was pleased v16 to reveal His son in me ...\n \n From v. 16, \"to reveal His son in me\", Spong claims:\n \n This was not a physical body recalled from the grave. The word for \"reveal\" in this text is ophthe, the same word used in the Greek Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Scriptures to describe the appearances of God (theophanies) or angels of God (angelophanies).... What was the nature of a theophany? Was it really \"physical\"? What was the means of hearing God's voice speak? Was it audible to any ear? Was it capable of being recorded or objectified?\n \n At first, we were impressed by this depth. But on checking a computerised concordance, we found that ophthe is sometimes used of ordinary physical \"seeing\" (Acts 7:26, 1 Tim. 3:16). A logician would also note that Spong commits the fallacy of false alternatives, because he overlooks the possibility that seeing could be both physical and supra-physical, rather that either/or. We thought that it was strange that Spong should ignore this point. However, we decided to check a Greek NT to see if Spong had at least analysed the word correctly in this passage. But we could not find ophthe in the passage. To give Spong a second shot, we checked a NT Greek Interlinear. The word was not there either. Instead, the Greek word for \"reveal\" in Gal. 1:16 is actually apokalupsai, not ophthe! Apokalupsai is often used in the NT in an objective sense.\n \n It is shocking to see that Spong was trying to attack traditional Christian belief by appealing to a mis-translation of a Greek word which is not even in the passage he is explaining. Prof. O'Collins is undoubtedly referring to this blunder when he wrote: \"What is said about a key verb St. Paul uses in Gal. 1:15f. shows that the bishop [Spong] has forgotten any Greek that he knew.\" Spong should heed O'Collins' kindly \"advice for his next book [which] is to let some real experts check it before publication.\"\n \n God-Lite Doesn't Cut It\n \n The most recent \"Religious Congregations and Membership\" study, published in 2000 (the study is conducted each decade) by the Glenmary Research Center, tells the statistical story. Progressive (liberal) churches are progressing, it seems, ever closer to oblivion. The Presbyterian Church U.S.A. (11,106 churches) has experienced a decline of 11.6 percent over the previous ten years; the United Methodist Church (35,721 churches) was down 6.7 percent; and the Episcopal Church (7,314 churches) lost 5.3 percent of its membership. Also, the United Churches of Christ (5,863 churches) declined 14.8 percent while the American Baptist Churches USA were down 5.7 percent.\n \n The denominations showing growth included the deeply conservative Southern Baptist Convention, a collection of 41,514 churches, whose overall growth rate was 5 percent. The traditionalist Presbyterian Church in America (as opposed the mainline Presbyterian Church U.S.A.) experienced an impressive 42.4 percent increase, while the Christian and Missionary Alliance rose 21.8 percent. Meanwhile, the Evangelical Free Church was up 57.2 percent, and Pentecostal denominations also boomed. The Assemblies of God, with 11,880 churches, saw 18.5 percent growth, while the Church of God, with 5,612 churches, saw growth of 40.2 percent. \n \n What is behind this traditionalist rise and progressive decline? The New York Times, in its summary of the survey, noted, \"Socially conservative churches that demand high commitment from their members grew faster than other religious denominations in the last decade....\" Glenmary director Ken Sanchagrin told the paper he was \"astounded to see that by and large the growing churches are those that we ordinarily call conservative. And when I looked at those that were declining, most were moderate or liberal churches. And the more liberal the denomination, by most people's definition, the more they were losing.\" \n \n http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/shiflett200506070747.asp\n \n Looks to me like it's Spong and his boys who are becoming \"increasingly irrelevant!\" Maybe he's the one who needs to trade in his God-Lite for the real thing before he becomes a dinosaur! <chuckle<",

But this consensus has been damaged by attacks from rational sceptics for the last couple of centuries. There is some evidence that the Christian moral centre is falling apart in our society. (Yeats' poem, The Second Coming, seems an increasingly relevant commentary on the spirit of the times). \n \n For those of us who bother thinking about the basis of a moral life, why can't we say that a religion of humanity can fill our sails as well as, or better than, the old wind of Christianity that is dying away?\n \n (Excuse me butting in when your response is to Jo Bennett).",
