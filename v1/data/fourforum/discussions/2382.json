(To both questions)\n \n Discuss.\n\n \n Yes Iraq can become a democracy. Infact I think that the Iraqi's have taken so well to freedom that they would put up a much stronger fight against a would be dictator than they are against us. The Iraqi people are clearly taking advantage of the fact that they are now able to say whatever they want to say and do whatever they want to do. I think many are already taking it for granted which is why they are using their new freedoms to stand up to those who helped them achieve these freedoms.\n \n As for whether it will succeed or not, it is just a matter of time in my opinion. They will have a democratic government put into place made up of Iraqi's. There will possibly be attempts on the lives of those Iraqi's and I think that will influence the nation even more to stand together with their new leaders and against those who would try to break the democracy. I think when it is finally set into place things will begin to calm down. The democracy will take years to finally stabilize but it will succeed and the rest of the Middle East will stand in the shadows of it. After that others in the region will begin to follow the democratic model.",

   "If we view Iraq as a sovereign nation (which it is), then the dominant religion will overcome any government that is installed. Sure, it may last awhile, but after the &#8220;aliens&#8221; walk away the dominant religion will slowly seep back in, replacing democratic rule with rituals.\n However, if you fuse democracy with military might (24/7 presence) then, yes, of course a democratic government can be installed and run the country. But, this will not be the democracy that we enjoy. If you take a so-called leader, prop him up in a chair, call him President, diktat his actions &#8211; would he be a leader? Or a puppet?\n I have no doubt that our intentions to free all people are pure and wholesome, but to force a government on a populous that have a rigid life support rooted in religion is futile &#8211; IMHO.\n On the other hand it is hard for me to believe that the present administration went into Iraq simply to control Iraq&#8217;s oil, privatize the economy, establish a permanent military presence, and dominate it&#8217;s foreign and defense policies.\n \n I could be blinded by the fact that I have trusted our own foreign policies far too long&#8230;but I hope not. \n \n At any rate, despite my own beliefs in what we (US) can and cannot do, installing a democracy in Iraq that is stable and is capable of self-sustenance is a waste of life.",

   "IMO the general populace of Iraq has not reached a point of examining the differences between freedom from being governed by a repressive dictatorship and the somewhat nebulous (when compared to Islamic Law) Western style of democracy. When that occurs, I'm in agreement with Ron, sinjin and others in that birthright culture and belief systems will dominate any future Iraq without our military presence being at a full control level. They need to get the inevitable internal power struggle over with and determine how the 'new' Iraq(s?) will fit into the Middle East and under what geographical boundaries. We're just wasting American lives and money by prolonging that. \n \n I do believe Ron's definition of our administration's Iraq intent is right on the money, especially after yesterday with Rummy defending our methods of interrogation in Iraq.",

The EU is forging ahead with heir trade deal with Syria, and the US only did about $250 million in business with them anyway. Most of what the US was providing is oil field equipment. France will be happy to take that business. Besides, I have heard the \"WMD's and supporting terrorists\" song and dance before.\n \n \n \n \nOf course in such a crackdown we would take a significant amount of casualties at one time. Perhaps twice as much as we did in Falluja. \n But in the long run it would help our mission and may even suffer less casualties than if we did nothing and continued to have our soldiers blown up one by one day after day.\n \n At this rate our soldier will continue to die with no end in sight if we continue to put up little opposition to their own.\n\n \n They would stop dying if we would pull back and admit we cannot storm the city.

While it is true that there are those in Iraq who would aid the insurgents there are also those who would not. \n Armored vehicles, tanks and air support could be used in opposition to the insurgents. For instance we would need helicopters / airplanes to take on relativley small air strikes in buildings and areas where our soldiers are fighting on the ground. The air support alone leaves the US army far superior. Not to mention our number of tanks and heavy armored vehicles we can use, even in towns.\n\n \n By the time you get a helicopter in close enough to perform, they are well inside RPG range, and bombing from aircraft is a poor solution because of the rate of civilian casualties you are likely to get. Besides, they have Grail SA-7b missiles. While the guidance system on the Grail is unsuitable for long range engagement (passive IR and easily fooled) it is deadly inside 1500 meters because at that kind of range you get a good solid lock, and flight time is only about 3.5 seconds (the Grail travels at mach 1.75, or about 500 meters per second, the extra half second is for acceleration). With the passive IR guidance, a helicopter pilot would not even get an alert for at least 2 seconds, because the onboard systems would not register the missile until it cleared ground clutter and made speed. Even if the pilot/gunner managed to deploy flares (or the system was set to do it automatically) 1.5 seconds is not long enough to ignite and deploy a flare. Even if, by some miracle, they did manage to pop one off, and the missile broke guidance to go after it, the detonation of the Grails HE warhead would still take out the chopper.\n \n Using armor in a city is a poor idea because vehicles are too easy to trap in a street. 2 trucks will generally do it, one in front and one behind. Then you just sit and launch grenades at it until you penetrate the armor. Alternatively, you get a 2-man fire crew and wait until the tank rolls up even with them. One fires to detonate the reactive armor that protects the treads on some US battle tanks, the other fires 2 seconds later to take out the tread. You then have a mostly immobile tank, which you destroy at your leisure from the elevated firing positions that are so abundant in a city, or you have a guy run up and set a home made thermite charge on the hatch and smoke a cigarette while you listen to the guys inside scream as the burn to death. Not a good way to die.\n \n \nAlso our men are far better trained. They have gone through at least 6 months of basic training, while the average insurgent has probably had no prior experience. The US forces and coalition are far better equipped with weaponry.\n\n \n They have gone through 6 months of basic training, where they received ONE day of urban combat instruction. Don't underestimate the experience of the insurgents. Remember, we managed to loose 400,000 member of the Iraqi army. Once you take the advantage of air support and armored vehicles away, a rifle is a rifle (though the AK is more maneuverable and fires a heavier round, as well as being more reliable, all good traits for a rifle in such a situation) and a grenade is a grenade.\n \n \nWe have far beyond maps at our disposal. Believe it or not but there is a significant number of Iraqis who wish to help the coalition and often do so. Such Iraqis would be useful in military planning and strategy.\n\n \n Yes, and they take that information and use it to improve their maps. \n \n \nAs far as fighting house to house, our army is still in better shape at this than the inexperienced insurgent and we also have special OPs who specialize in this field of fighting. \n \n \n We do have a limited number of special ops troops trained in such situations. Some of them even have experience in urban combat. I would imagine it is these guys who have been smart enough to look at the situation and say \"not a good idea\".\n \n \n \nNumber one I would like a credible source showing the story of this demonstration. \n \n \n Al-Quds is running the story on their web page with pictures. You might also tune into Al-Jazeera, they have shown the story a couple of times, with ground level video.\n \n \nNobody went hungry? People were not randomly imprisoned?\n \n Excuse my bluntless but both of these statements are complete BS.\n\n \n Really? and how would you know this. The answer....you wouldn't. You have never been there. You have heard the stories, many of which are designed to dehumanize the enemy as opposed to actually conveying facts. In Iraq, there were peoples aid centers in every city. They would feed anybody, even foreigners. The food was not good (having eaten it before, I would actually say the food was very bad) but you did not starve. Once our sanctions kicked in, many of the aid stations were closed, and people did indeed starve to death. \n \n And under Saddam, no, people were not randomly imprisoned. People were imprisoned without charges at times, people were imprisoned for conspiring against the government, or being an enemy of the party, but people were not imprisoned because some random person grabbed a cop on the street and said \"joe schmo is a terrorist\" \n \n \nAre you actaully saying that the Iraqi people are better off with Saddam in power?\n\n \n Right now, I would have to say it is too close to call. I know from the Iraqi perspective, nothing has changed except the uniforms, and now people are starving, and without water, and without power part of the time, and the phones don't work, and people are randomly imprisoned and the cost of gas has quadrupled, the cost of building materials has tripled (due to the US buying them all up to build our new bases). \n \n If we actually pull things ff the way it is planned, life will most likely be much better for the Iraqi people. As it stands now, it is probably worse for the guy on the street.\n \n \nDo you know about the mass graves?\n\n \n Yes, I also know that there are not a lot of graveyards in the Middle East. Unless you have quite a bit of money to be buried, there is a better than average chance you will end up in a mass grave or in an unmarked grave in the desert somewhere. You will note that the majority of mass graves we have found were fairly recent, like from the last ten years, when people were starving to death in Iraq and the adult death rate more than quadrupled due to our sanctions (infants and children were hit even harder). Very few people in Iraq had money for a decent burial during the sanctions, thus they ended up in mass graves. I have yet to see even an American channel report that the residents of these graves appear to have been executed (and I am certain that if they could actually show this they would).\n \n The big \"mass graves\" thing is an example of Americans not understanding Arabs. Mass graves are not that uncommon in the Middle East. You have a bunch of dead people, you have a bulldozer, and they see a solution to this problem. When we hear \"mass graves\" we think of massacres being covered up. Several places in Africa they also use mass graves, or will bury people where they are almost touching without benefit of a coffin (it is not unusual in Rwanda to hit another body with your shovel while digging a grave in a burial spot (I hesitate to call it a cemetery)\n \n I also know that there have been several mass graves created by the Americans. Civilian casualties (And some military) who were unclaimed were stacked in truck, taken out in the desert, and dumped in a pit. Apparently Americans are also able to look at a pile of dead bodies and a bulldozer and see a solution to the problem.\n \n \nDo you know of the raping sprees of Saddams sons and the hundreds of political prisoners?\n\n \n Have heard the rumors. Have not seen anything to confirm it, and frankly think it is a bunch of bunk. Saddam and his sons were the most powerful men in Iraq. They could have pulled any woman in off the street, done what they wanted, and tossed her out the door. Why would they decide instead to run down to the local prison and rape some smelly, unwashed, already defiled prisoner instead?\n \n I can certainly believe that some members of the prison staff were involved in raping prisoners, but I seriously doubt that Saddam and his sons would have done it. It just doesn't make sense, especially when it was widely known in Iraq hat Saddam maintained a virtual harem of some of the most beautiful women in Iraq. So, on the one hand, you can go down and drop into bed with a beautiful, well kept woman who is willing to fulfill your every desire, OR, you can head down and rape some woman who has been living in the squalor of an Iraqi prison, where they were only allowed to bathe every 2 weeks (water is precious in the desert) and even then they bathe in unfiltered water from the river. I know which I would choose. Even if you DID wake up in the mood to do some raping, why would you do that? You could just send somebody from your secret police out to grab you a nice, washed woman from the street. Then you also have the satisfaction of knowing you will turn her out dishonored and defiled.\n \n \nDo you know about the oil for food program scandal? \n Do you know why it was called \"oil for food\"? Because the people NEEDED food.\n\n \n Yes, they NEEDED food because of the harsh sanctions against Iraq. Those people knew why there was not enough food or medicine in Iraq, and they knew it was because of the sanctions.\n \n \nAre you not aware of the Saddam's torture chambers?\n\n \n Yes, and apparently the US has put them back into action. I am also aware that the torture chambers were reserved for especially foul people. Americans seem to have this idea that people were just being randomly pulled in off the street and tortured to death. Not the case.\n \n \nOf how his regime is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of his own people as well as Kurds?\n\n \n The kurds were rebelling. Maybe it was an overreaction, maybe not (considering the political situation in Iraq). As far as Saddam being responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people, prove it. \n \n \nwise up, don't be so ignorant \n \n \n I don't think I am the one displaying ignorance here. Your reply shows a general ignorance in military tactics. You have demonstrated that you do not question things objectively, you just buy into whatever you are told. several of the things in your post defy logic and show a complete lack of understanding of the cultural differences between the middle east and the western world, which are significant in these circumstances.\n \n I realize that in order to accept the invasion and occupation of Iraq, absent the existence of terrorist ties and WMD's, it is necessary to transform Saddam Hussein into a monster. This is not how he was generally viewed by his people, or by other people in the region. Many in the Middle East saw saddam as a good leader. He seized the oil wells for the people when he first took power, and while he obviously kept a lot of the wealth generated for himself, some of it actually did make it down to the people and was used to help the people. This is not the case in other middle eastern nations, where a handful of fabulously wealthy sheiks own everything and treat the average Joe like something he found on his shoe after walking through a camel pen. \n \n Even the kurds were arguably treated well. They were treated better than the Israelis treat the Palestinians. Saddam more or less left the kurds alone, they set up their own local governments and lived their own lives (while taking aid from the Iraqi government). It was not until they decided they would carve out their own country that Saddam attacked them. And we are not talking about a few bombings here, we are talking about a military mobilization involving heavy weapons and in a few cases even armor. He put the smack down hard after that.",
