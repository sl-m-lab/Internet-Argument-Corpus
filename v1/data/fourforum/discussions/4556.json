His kids are all worthless.\n\n I really enjoyed reading Sam Walton's biography and his journey from one small town store to an empire. \n In my town there was a hardware store on the square that had been there, ran by the same family, as long as I could remember. I used to drive the extra miles to buy there because I liked the idea of buying one quality bolt or fifty, depending on my need. I also enjoyed the GENUINE greeting at the door from someone who knew where every item in the old store was located. I recall when it was announced that they were closing, I asked if WalMart was a reason. The owner replied, \"WalMart does not close stores, customers do\". I really miss that old store.\n Dono",

   "I really enjoyed reading Sam Walton's biography and his journey from one small town store to an empire. \n \n\n \n You'd equally enjoy Richard Sears' biography I would guess. I have a hunch Sam was familiar with many of the reasons behind Sears Roebucks' phenomenal success in the early 20th century, due largely to Sears' personality. It seems to me as though Walton copied a page out right of Richard's book on how to sell anything. I see many parallels in their public faces: the folksy manner in which they both could convey trust to buy anything they had for sale, determination to be the lowest-priced retailer, along with an ironclad money back guarantee if one wasn't completely satisfied. \n \n Sears had a tougher job of selling, IMO. He had to convince people to mail him their hard-earned money for an unseen product. He proved to be a master at it, describing items for sale in his early catalogs with a disarming aw-shucks charm, and standing firmly behind each and every gew-gaw. The orders rolled in, and the legend was born. The company enjoyed a sterling reputation with the public for decades--one of only a handful of U.S. companies that attained that privilege--due in large part to its founder, until it squandered its good name in the critical years of the 1970's and '80's.\n \n I collect Sears memorabilia, and enjoy watching the secretive company to this day. I'm fascinated by retailing, by those who do it well, and you've reminded me to pick up a copy of Walton's biography.",
