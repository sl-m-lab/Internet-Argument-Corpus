Fox where he \"quotes\": If you...examined [The 16th Amendment] carefully, you would find that a significant number of states never ratified that amendment.)\n \n is utter bull$hit.\n \n \n The specific court case, which is Sullivan v. United States, is a case in which the plaintiffs attempted, unsuccessfully, to prevent the deployment of troops to Iraq. \n \n The comments with respect to the Sixteenth Amendment did not constitute a ruling in the case - Stare decisis - and were mentioned only in passing in the decision - Obiter dictum. The transcript reads:\n \n \"I will say I think, you know, colonel, I have to tell you that there are cases where a long course of history in fact does change the Constitution, and I can think of one instance. I believe I'm correct on this. I think if you were to go back and try to find and review the ratification of the 16th amendment, which was the internal revenue, income tax, I think if you went back and examined that carefully, you would find that a sufficient number of states never ratified that amendment...And nonetheless, I think it's fair to say that it is part of the Constitution of the United States, and I don't think any court would ever...set it aside.\"\n \n \n He also quotes Rothschild as sayng: Give me control of a nation's money supply, and I care not who makes its laws.\n \n The narrator in the film then states \"[Rothschild] knew that he and the other bankers would now control the laws of the nation,\" thus implying that Rothschild was part of the passing of the Act. This is particularly deceitful attempt as Rothschild died in 1812, and the act was passed in 1913.\n \n Also couldn't find that Woodrow Wilson quote anywhere.\n \n \n All that being said, just in the first five minutes I've seen that they are full of shite.\n \n But, I will watch it, not only to see what other lies they come up with, but also because it is fascinating - fascinating in the same way as watching a train wreck in front of you.",

   "The problem is that no one wants to mention the elephant in the room-- just wring their hands at all the elephant-dung appearing out of nowhere. \n No one wants to talk about the issue of state sovereignty, since that opens up a can of ad-hominem personal attacks from the Church of Lincoln, and all the the \"anti-union\" and \"pro-slavery\" stigma attached to it-- along with being called a neo-confederate, fringe-lunacy extremist.... and the ever-classic \"that was settled by the Civil War, you're just revising history\" etc.\n \n Just look at the typical histrionics flung like monkey-mess against the very mention of the subject, in the Civil War debate-thread here:\n \n \nI refuse to deal any longer with this type of blatant historical revisionism.\n \n The traitorous South made war on the United States, and it received a very mild chastisement for its impudence.\n \n To be a proper chastisement for its arrogance, I might think about removing armed military United States troops from the conquered territory just about now.emoticon_xbye\n\n \n So everyone wants to remove the Devil, but no one wants to mention his name-- but just whine at all the hellfire polluting the world.\n \n Likewise, everyone wants to whine about all the violations of the Constitution, but not recognize that state sovereignty is the only means to PREVENT such; as for the rest, how's that working out for ya?\n \n This therefore requires defining the nature of the states themselves, which current history denies: in reality, each state was founded as a free and sovereign nation via its People, as Jefferson expressly declared each \"Free and Independent States... and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do.\" He likewise clearly stated that their governments derived their just powers by consent of the governed, who likewise held the right to alter or abolish that government-- ie. that the People of each state were its ruling sovereigns, and that governments were simply delegated authority thereby. \n \n This was likewise retained in 1781 under the Articles of Confederation, against British contest; and once Britain acknowledged this sovereignty, it was never officially altered to the contrary by the Constitution or otherwise. Hence, the term \"The People\" as used in the Constitution, referred not simply to individuals, but to the People of each state respectively.\n \n Naturally, this was suppressed in the Civil War, when the federal government likewise surpressed the turth regarding the sovereignty of every state-- but again, never officially altered the sovereign status of the individual states, via their people. And hence the Supreme Court-- along with the other branches of the federal government-- has since been living that lie, attempting to play fast-and-loose with the facts, playing lip-service to due process while wielding omnipotent and final authority-- as James Madison predicted over 208 years ago in his Report on the Virginia Resolutions:\n \n \"However true, therefore, it may be, that the judicial department is, in all questions submitted to it by the forms of the Constitution, to decide in the last resort, this resort must necessarily be deemed the last in relation to the authorities of the other departments of the government; not in relation to the rights of the parties to the constitutional compact, from which the judicial, as well as the other departments, hold their delegated trusts. On any other hypothesis, the delegation of judicial power would annul the authority delegating it; and the concurrence of this department with the others in usurped powers, might subvert forever, and beyond the possible reach of any rightful remedy, the very Constitution which all were instituted to preserve.\"\n \n \n And so it has.",

   "My issue is that the so called \"Federal\" Reserve Bank is actually privately owned, and that Presidents who opposed its creation were assassinated. It stinks of conspiracy in that we were forewarned that he who controls the money, controls the people. Any errors in facts apart from that are irrelevant to the issue. President Wilson, who signed the bill into law 1 hour after it was passed, later regretted his decision and felt he betrayed the American people in favor of a small group of unelected men.\n The Federal Reserve Act of 1913, also called the Glass-Owen Bill, established the Federal Reserve System in the United States. The bill was proposed as a result of hearings held by a Congressional committee, headed by Representative Ars\u00e8ne Pujo of Louisiana, charged with investigating the control of the U.S. economy by influential bankers. The bill was passed by the Senate on the evening of December 23, 1913 by a vote of 43-25, with 27 Senators absent or abstaining. President Wilson signed the bill into law an hour after its passing.\n \n President Wilson later came to regret signing the bill: \"I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men. We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated Governments in the civilized world no longer a Government by free opinion, no longer a Government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a Government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men.\"Federal Reserve Act United States System President Bill",

When a person can't bank and trade their money as they wish, that's slavery. When a person is drafted, that's slavery.\n All these things happened started under Lincoln, continued under Wilson, and exploded under FDR; however they are all inevitable under statism.\n \n \nThe \"road to serfdom\", as Hayek highlights, is largely self-sustaining, it doesn't require an architect to plot it out in advance.\n\n It does in a democracy; that's why people are indoctrinated to the Pledge of Allegiance, which is simply an imperial loyalty-oath force-fed to children to claim that the USA is \"one nation, indivisible--\" when in reality it isn't, any more than than the UN.",
