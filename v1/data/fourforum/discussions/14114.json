   "Corporations rather than human beings...\n \nPublished on Tuesday, April 6, 2010 by CommonDreams.org\n Who Killed the Miners? Profits Over Safety?\n by Jeff Biggers\n All coal mining safety laws have been written in miners' blood. \n .... As our prayers and condolences go out to the many coal mining families in Raleigh County, West Virginia, I think about the needless safety violations and subsequent disasters that have taken place over the past century.\n \n Over 104,000 Americans and immigrants have died in our coal mines. According to one inspector, many, if not a majority of those \"accidents\" should not be considered mishaps, but acts of negligent homicide.\n \n As a coal miner's widow from Raleigh County, West Virginia told me on the phone last night, every time she sees a miner just off his shift, draped in coal dust, standing at the convenience market, she knows that mine is rife with violations. ...\n\n Who Killed the Miners? Profits Over Safety? | CommonDreams.org\n \n But satisfying greed and hunger for more and more money and profit, that's so much more important than mere human life.\n \n Human life is so cheap in the eyes of Don Blankenship of Massey Energy, owner of two mines where horrific mine disasters have occurred, Upper Big Branch South and Sago... John Murray CEO of Murray Energy, owner of Crandall Canyon mine in Utah where the bodies of six miners will never be recovered from the disaster of 2007:\n \n.... The family of John Jones now shares a tragic bond with the families of six Crandall Canyon mine disaster victims.\n \n None will have the opportunity to lay their loved ones to rest, a void that greatly pained family members of the six coal miners buried by an implosion of the Crandall Canyon mine's walls on Aug. 6, 2007. A second violent outburst at the mine killed three would-be rescuers 10 days later, but their bodies were recovered and given traditional burials.\n \n As an attorney for the survivors of many Crandall Canyon victims, Salt Lake City attorney Ed Havas learned the importance of body recovery and burial to the human grieving process.\n \n \"Being able to offer that last gesture of love and respect furthers the process of acceptance and closure,\" he said, extending his condolences to the Jones family. \"It's important to have a place that is sanctified and hallowed, separate from any other, at which to pay respects.\n \n \"The [six] Crandall Canyon families, and now the Jones family, are deprived of having that closure, that special place reserved for them and no others. Though the mine, or in this case the cave, becomes a tomb, it's not the same. Memorials, markers, placards or other recognition, important and meaningful as they are, are no substitute,\" he added. \n\n Cave death: Again grief, but without 'closure' - Salt Lake Tribune\n \n Oh! Tiskey! Tiskey! These feeble and sentimental human feelings about stupid stuff like \"closure\" and being able to lay the bodies of loved ones to rest. Such stuff and nonsense about mere human life interferes with corporate profit and growth and it must not be allowed!",

I must ask my Pittsburgh daughter to vet your school.\n \n And, here's how filthy-rich mine owners avoid complying with U.S. safety regulations:\n \nArmed with tougher federal mining laws passed in 2006, federal investigators had new powers to crack down on mines with persistent violations.\n \n But mining companies have been able to fend off this tougher regulatory approach by challenging more of the citations filed against them.\n \n As recently as March, for example, federal mine inspectors found dangerous coal dust accumulations during two separate inspections at the Massey Energy Company&#8217;s Upper Big Branch mine, the site of an explosion on Monday that killed at least 25 miners.\n \n And throughout last year, the mine, in Montcoal, W.Va., was cited for failing to conduct inspections that would have spotted dangerous piles of coal dust and other unsafe conditions.\n \n Massey appealed at least 37 of the 50 citations for serious safety violations that it received last year.\n \n At a hearing in February, Representative George Miller, Democrat of California, complained that the growing number of appeals by coal companies threatened to &#8220;render the federal efforts to hold mine operators accountable meaningless.&#8221; Mining safety experts have expressed similar concerns. \n\n Mines Fight Strict Laws by Filing More Appeals - NYTimes.com\n \n Also, if it's not too difficult for you, you might give a read to:\n \n Reckoning at Eagle Creek: The Secret Legacy of Coal in the Heartland by Jeff Biggers, Pub.

   "Yeah, as I've gotten older and wiser I've learned that you shouldn't just jump to a conclusion if you have no basis for understanding the situation. For example, I have no knowledge of the mining industry, at all. I do not know how inspections work, what various citations mean, what the industry average is..etc. Most people don't. \n\n \n I do. I know ALL about it. In fact, there is a piece of paper sitting on my desk that says \n \n US Department of Labor\n Mine Safety and Health Administration\n Office of Assessments\n PROPOSED ASSESSMENT\n \n \n What is it? It is a big, big fine from MSHA. They inspected a site I own about 2 months ago and wrote me 8 separate citations for 8 separate safety violations. \n \n You know how many of them I intend to contest? All of them but one. Is it because I am a greedy jerk who is putting profits ahead of safety? No. It is because of the 8 citations I got only one of them is not completely and totally retarded. \n \n The inspection took place in Feb. The mine was CLOSED in Feb. There were no workers assigned to work there. There was no activity going on. I happened to stop by there to pick up some paperwork. 10 minutes earlier or later and I would not have even seen the MSHA jerk. Instead he happened to show up at the exact right time and decided they were inspecting even though the location was closed.\n \n I immediately got a citation for not filling out a mine inspection form for the day before....despite the fact that there was nobody there to inspect the day before. Then I got a citation because a wheel loader that had JUST been delivered (that morning) and was STILL ON THE TRAILER did not have a working backup alarm or brake lights. (it turned out that the backup alarm DID work but was activated by rearward motion, not just the lever).\n \n It is idiotic citations like that which lead to operators lodging a bunch of protests and contesting their citations. \n \n MSHA fines can be HUGE. You can LITERALLY get a $20,000.00 ticket for having an extension cord on site with worn insulation. It does not have to be worn through, or present any kind of hazard, it just has to be worn. A scuff can literally cost you 20 grand. It does not even have to be in use. It does not even have to be YOURS. It can be an extension cord that an employee has in the back of his pickup in the parking area!!!\n \n The truth is that MSHA does not save lives. If anything MSHA kills people. Backup alarms are a good example of this. It used to be that backup alarms were required on any equipment with an obstructed view to the rear. They were a good idea and almost certainly saved lives because when you heard one you sat up and took notice because you knew that somebody was backing up a machine weighing tens of tons and they did not have any idea what was behind them....they were going on faith. \n \n Now they have changed the scope of \"obstructed view to the rear\" to the point that the riding lawn mower they use out there to mow around the office has a back up alarm on it. I am not even kidding.\n \n You go out there and all you hear is BEEP....BEEP....BEEP....BEEP...BEEP...BEEP...BEEP....BEEP\n It takes new employees about 2 days to learn to tune out the backup alarms completely. I have literally come within inches of being backed over by a wheel loader with a fully functional backup alarm because I just dont hear them anymore. \n \n We have a very expensive and resource intensive program in place to combat safety related deaths. MSHA sets up training programs that hammer the guys to the point that they dont THINK about safety, they just coast through it. They have been so inundated with safety garbage that they turn off. \n \n Why put an expensive and resource intensive program in place to combat the federally mandated safety garbage? Because the truth of the matter is that MSHA is worthless when it comes to preventing fatalities. The market and worker compensation laws pretty much did away with the \"lives for profits\" thing. \n \n Reality is that if one of my people were to die, it would wipe out several years profits if not put that mine under completely. Workmans comp insurance is SO expensive if you have any past claims at all that employers are MORE than willing to put forth whatever they need to in order to assure worker safety. Granted there are jobs that are just plain dangerous and that is just the nature of the job, but employers do try their best.\n \n What is going to come out of this is the same thing that came out of the Sago disaster. People who know NOTHING AT ALL about mining like simone and who have an image in their head right out of the 1920s when it comes to mine owners and safety will freak out and a bunch of nonsensical new laws and regulations will be passed that make life even MORE dangerous for miners because these well intentioned people think they know more about mine safety than the guys who actually work in the mine. \n \n So, Simone, should I be allowed to contest the citations from MSHA or for some reason should I not have the right that every other american has to face my accuser in court and have my case heard?\n \n The truth is that it does not matter as far as safety is concerned how many citations you contest. Here is why:\n \n When an MSHA inspector issues a safety citation you have a given period of time to get that citation vacated. For example, on my wheel loader citation he gave me 24 hours to fix the problem. If I had not fixed the problem within 24 hours he would have issued a B order, which is an order that states that the piece of equipment can not be used until the MSHA inspector has verified that the defect has been fixed. \n \n In the case of that wheel loader, I removed the wheel loader from the site. He drove by the next day, saw it was gone, and terminated the citation.\n \n Now I am contesting the violation. It will probably be 2 years before there is a resolution but from a safety standpoint it does not matter because the underlying safety issue (if you want to pretend that is actually a safety issue) has already been fixed. \n \n The other thing worth considering because the media has talked a lot about it is that the fines issued by MSHA are typically reduced by over 40% if you contest the violation and get it in front of an administrative judge. A lot of media outlets have implied that this is somehow improper and that the laxness of the judges is leading to unsafe conditions.\n \n Sorry. That is WRONG and ILLOGICAL. In truth, fines are typically reduced by over 40% because they were WRONG to begin with. MSHA bases fines on a point system that includes points for history of violations, size of company, gravity of the offense, and implied level of negligence. Size of the company and violation history are pretty simple. The gravity of the offense and level of negligence are not simple and they are, in large part, a judgment call. \n \n A year ago an MSHA inspector checking my mine walked around behind a rock crusher and found (not even kidding) a guy smoking a joint. He decided that the gravity of the offense was as high as it could possibly be and so was MY negligence. I agree that the gravity of the offense was high as far as the EMPLOYEE goes, but I did not feel like I had even COMMITTED an offense. The ticket I got was HUGE.\n \n I contested the ticket and the judge decided (correctly in my opinion) that we did not have an environment at the mine that encouraged drug use...in fact we have random drug testing in place and a zero tolerance policy when it comes to drug use. He agreed with me that I had committed NO offense. We had good programs in place, we took steps to ensure that people did not use drugs, and there is no LEGAL way (not legal in kansas to strip search your employees on their way into work) for us to ensure that the event did not take place.\n \n HE also found that even if I HAD committed an offense there would have been NO negligence because the employee had gone out of their way to hide their actions from us (by hiding behind the crusher).",

I was traveling and was notified and immediately called and chartered a flight back, including helicopter transportation from the airport to the mine site. \n \n In the mean time, the injured party refused to be strapped to a stretcher for transport to the local hospital. Instead he put some neosporin on the cut and put a band aid on it from one of the 11 first aid kits that we keep on the site. \n \n Completely and utterly retarded, but it is what federal law currently requires.
