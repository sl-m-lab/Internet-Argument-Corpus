   "I've seen some of the posts from some of the more close minded persons on this board and I would like to clarify in detail what really happened since I was there. Basically I arrived there mid afternoon with a close friend and saw that the intersection of Santa Monica and San Vicente was empty because BHPD was preventing the main body of protesters from moving any further.\n \n So Me and my friend walked the three miles to the Mormon church. We arrived just as the people were finally being escorted by police to march back to where we were. I got right in front and marched with a No on 8 sign and my pride wristband, along with over 3000 other people. It was electrifying! People were shouting \"Gay strait black white marriage is a civil right!\" The leader of the rally named Joi or known as \"Mother Joi\" was leading the movement with her bullhorn and had been rallying since 12pm that afternoon. Keep in mind it was around 9pm that this took place.\n \n So to my surprise she gave me the bullhorn! And I continued to shout and rally everyone. People from shops and restaurants poured out into the streets to watch us pass. Some even formed up with us and marched! I can't begin to describe the energy and the emotion everyone felt. \n \n Eventually we reached West Hollywood and was greeted by other protesters and the city council including the mayor who had just gotten married to his husband 2 weeks ago. Then we heard that other protesters were being spat on by Mormons inside the gates of their church and even 4 young teenage girls were assaulted! I can confirm this cause I saw the footage on the local news when I visited my friends Ken and Michael after the rally.\n \n More protests are planned including a huge one in silver lake tonight in an hour an a half. I would go but I have to play at a gig at a local restaurant tonight otherwise I'd be down there. I do however plan on attending a candle light vigil in Redlands tomorrow. \n \n So to all you people who think that gays are going to just lie down and take this or think that the fight is over your sadly mistaken. Instead of silencing equality and civil rights you have sparked a flame in the hearts of thousands all over this country who will not rest until this injustice is righted.",

James Dobson spoke. NOT the people who were fed fear, lies, and spin from these religious nuts. And the constitution and the bill of rights will prevail. Sorry to say it but you awoke a monster. And its about damn time!",
