   "Shocking excerpts of confidential recordings recently released under the Freedom of Information Act feature former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld talking with top military analysts about how a flagging Neo-Con political agenda could be successfully restored with the aid of another terrorist attack on America. \n \n The tape also includes a conversation where Rumsfeld and the military analysts agree on the possible necessity of installing a brutal dictator in Iraq to oversee U.S. interests. \n \n The tapes were released as part of the investigation into the Pentagon's \"message force multipliers\" program in which top military analysts were hired to propagandize for the Iraq war in the corporate media. \n \n In attendance at the valedictory luncheon Rumsfeld hosted on December 12, 2006 were David L. Grange, Donald W. Sheppard, James Marks, Rick Francona, Wayne Downing, and Robert H. Scales, Jr. among others. \n \n The most extraordinary exchange takes place when Lt. Gen. Michael DeLong bemoans shrinking political support for Neo-Con war plans on Capitol Hill and suggests that sympathy for the Bush administration's agenda will only be achieved after a new terror attack. \n \n Rumsfeld agrees that the psychological impact of 9/11 is wearing off and the \"behavior pattern\" of citizens in both the U.S. and Europe suggests that they are unconcerned about the threat of terror. \n DELONG: Politically, what are the challenges because you're not going to have a lot of sympathetic ears up there until it [a terror attack] happens. \n \n RUMSFELD: That's what I was just going to say. This President's pretty much a victim of success. We haven't had an attack in five years. The perception of the threat is so low in this society that it's not surprising that the behavior pattern reflects a low threat assessment. The same thing's in Europe, there's a low threat perception. The correction for that, I suppose, is an attack. And when that happens, then everyone gets energized for another [inaudible] and it's a shame we don't have the maturity to recognize the seriousness of the threats...the lethality, the carnage, that can be imposed on our society is so real and so present and so serious that you'd think we'd be able to understand it, but as a society, the longer you get away from 9/11, the less...the less...\n In another exchange, after assuring that comments are \"off the record,\" Rumsfeld and one of the military analysts agree that Iraq could use a \"Syngman Rhee\" to take control of Iraq. Syngman Rhee was the ruthless authoritarian dictator of South Korea from after World War II through the Korean War to 1960. If the invasion of Iraq was about liberating the Iraqis from a tyrant in the form of Saddam Hussein why is Rumsfeld talking about installing an even more brutal dictator?\n Rumsfeld On Tape: Terror Attack Could Restore Neo-Con Agenda\n \n Audio clips are available at the web-site.\n \n In retrospect, I can't help but think that it was a \"terror attack\" which took the Bush administration from being abjectly uninterested in bin Laden and the issue (it even took him a little while to get torn away from the children's story he was hearing when the attack occurred), to a hyper-sensitive state where we attack countries for non-existent WMDs.\n \n And now they are talking about more terror attacks inducing more activism?",

   "I don't see what the big deal here is about his terror attack comments. He didn't say he hopes there's an attack or that we should try to be attacked. He was clearly talking about the fact people get complacent the longer they get from 9/11 and aren't attacked. I agree with his sentiments--we should try to be more vigilant even in the absence of attack. It's the same thing that happens to people who live in earthquake-prone areas. If an earthquake hasn't happened in 100 years in a fault zone people tend to think it will never happen and get complacent.",
