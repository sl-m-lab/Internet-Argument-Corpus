In the strictest technical sense, people do not have \"free speech rights when they are standing on private property...or working for a private employer, because those rights are between them and the government.

The law in such a case would control the rights of the employer and it is his or her First Amendment rights that would be violated or not. The employee's First Amendment rights cannot be \"enforced\" on the employer unless that employer happens to be the government.\n \n \nSo if an employer tried to restrict an employee's religious freedoms they would be violating laws meant to uphold religious freedom, based on the first amendment.\n\n \n No, not at all. The First Amendment does not apply to the employer-employee relationship, period. This is a well established principle, if not very well known outside of law schools and courtrooms. Other laws may apply, just not the First Amendment, and if they apply to the employer then it is the employer's 1A rights that are implicated.\n \n \nBascially, any time two private entities are in disagreement it's generally the government that arbitrates, and the state's arbitration must then follow first amendment guidelines.

Dorks like me live for this stuff.\n \n *Then there's the interesting questions of whether these laws violate the 1A rights of the people they regulate, like landlords.

Chaplain leading a prayer for the whole division before they board the plane for Iraq: OK as long as attendance and/or participation is voluntary, probably should make it sect-neutral (could say \"God\" but probably not \"Allah\" or \"Jesus\").

Ironically a prohibition against this would be more a violation of the participant's free exercise rights than that of the chaplain himself/herself.

They are specifically allowed to use the name in chapel serrvices, which you've been under the mistaken belief was a right they were being denied.

   "George Washington on the First American Chaplains, etc.\n \n On July 9, 1776, the Continental Congress authorized the Continental Army to provide chaplains for their troops. General George Washington then issued the order and appointed chaplains to every regiment. On the same day, he issued the general order to his troops, stating:\n \n \"The General hopes and trusts that every officer and man, will endeavor so to live, and act, as becomes a Christian Soldier defending the dearest Rights and Liberties of his country.\"\n \n On May 12, 1779, General George Washington was visited at his Middle Brook military encampment by the Chiefs of the Delaware Indian tribe. They had brought three youths to be trained in the American schools. Washington assured them commenting:\n \n \"Congress will look upon them as their own Children ... You do well to wish to learn our arts and ways of life, and above all, the religion of Jesus Christ. These will make you a greater and happier people than you are. Congress will do everything they can to assist you in this wise intention.\"\n \n In writing to the Hebrew Congregations of the City of Savannah, Georgia, President George Washington petitioned:\n \n \"May the same wonder-working Deity, who long since delivering the Hebrews fro their Egyptian Oppressors planted them in the promised land -- whose providential agency has lately been conspicuous in establishing these United States as an independent Nation -- still continue to water them with the dews of Heaven and to make the inhabitants of every denomination participate in the temporal and spiritual blessings of that people whose God is Jehovah.\"\n \n http://members.aol.com/rcorron/washington.html",

   "Nonsense. NAMBLA is a criminal organization. \n\n \n Talking about something that is illegal, short of a conspiracy, is not illegal and should damn well not be illegal. That was the point of the ACLU being in the case - a point you either ignore or do not understand, obviously. NAMBLA, despite their rather disgusting agenda, is no more a criminal organization than NORML, or for that matter, the NRA. The principle is the same - the subject matter is incidental.\n \n \nAt various times they've had articles on their website on how to seduce (illegally rape) young boys. And you and the ACLU want to protect that kind of morally and legally reprehensible \"speech\"? Anyone with half a sense of decency wouldn't touch them with a 10 foot pole. Only the radical left thinks that's a good cause.\n\n \n Once again - this is not a right/left issue. It has been cast as that by those that do not understand the issue at stake, or who would prefer to bleat and make noise rather than actually understand the nature of the case and the reasons why the ACLU got involved. It takes a lot less brainpower to say \"Oooooh...it's a case about pedophilia! The ACLU likes peverts!\" than to actually undertand the right under threat in the case. People like O'Reilly make a living out of providing thoughtless (and often misleading) drivel to those that would rather parrot a talking point than actually think.\n \n ACLU Statement on Defending Free Speech of Unpopular Organizations (8/31/2000)\n \n \n FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n \n \n NEW YORK--In the United States Supreme Court over the past few years, the American Civil Liberties Union has taken the side of a fundamentalist Christian church, a Santerian church, and the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. In celebrated cases, the ACLU has stood up for everyone from Oliver North to the National Socialist Party. In spite of all that, the ACLU has never advocated Christianity, ritual animal sacrifice, trading arms for hostages or genocide. In representing NAMBLA today, our Massachusetts affiliate does not advocate sexual relationships between adults and children.\n \n What the ACLU does advocate is robust freedom of speech for everyone. The lawsuit involved here, were it to succeed, would strike at the heart of freedom of speech. The case is based on a shocking murder. But the lawsuit says the crime is the responsibility not of those who committed the murder, but of someone who posted vile material on the Internet. The principle is as simple as it is central to true freedom of speech: those who do wrong are responsible for what they do; those who speak about it are not.\n \n It is easy to defend freedom of speech when the message is something many people find at least reasonable. But the defense of freedom of speech is most critical when the message is one most people find repulsive. That was true when the Nazis marched in Skokie. It remains true today. \n \n From http://www.aclu.org\n \n Some people just don't get it, others just don't want to get it. Which are you?",

The precedent that might have been set by prosecuting someone for talking about a crime would have been in direct violation of our most sacred law. Have you read the case? If you can't separate the legal principles from the subject matter, you aren't really qualified to comment, IMHO.\n \n \nIf the ACLU truly wants to defend free speech, why would they not put those efforts into the many groups, individuals, organizations, etc. that truly need it for a non-harmful message?\n\n \n Because those people aren't being targeted by the government, overzealous PC school board people, or the local cops.
