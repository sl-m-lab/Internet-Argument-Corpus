Are severely mentally handicapped \"people\" not really people? I would say that 'person' or \"people\" really includes lots of things (such as a God is referred to sometimes as a person) but while persons can be many things one of them is human. So if one is a human then they are a person (as all humans are persons in any dictionary you look at). The basic logic and understanding would lead one to say that all humans are person but not all persons are humans. So since a fetus is a human it is a person. The fetus's ability to make a choice is irrelevant just like the ability of a 1 second old baby who can't make a choice is irrelevant. They should both be afforded the ability be alive until they can make a choice for themselves. Pro-choice really means limited choice. The choice comes down to making a choice for another.",

   "How is this inconsistent? If you are pro-life you would rather not see someone murdered because it is an injustice. The death-penalty can be seen as a type of justice. Many catholics are against the death-penalty though. As for military affairs, the same standard applies. The Nazis received justice for their actions of being unjust.\nOf course, people who are against the death penalty also are against people being murdered. They just do not believe in using death as a penalty. You may claim it is justice to kill the murderer (and I'll admit that if someone I loved were killed, I might be emotionally distraught enough to believe so too) but it is really no different than state-sanctioned vengeance. Is that really what we want as our sense of justice? As for military solutions, even the most ardent liberal (which I am not, being a left-of-center moderate) would concede that there are some situations where war is necessary. Unfortunately, most people who are politicially pro-life also tend to jump to military solutions far earlier than those who are politically pro-choice.\n \nDoes having a mind that makes you able to choose make you a person? Doubtful this is the only criteria or even the main portion of it. If this is the case then people can go in and out of being people all the time. Are severely mentally handicapped \"people\" not really people? I would say that 'person' or \"people\" really includes lots of things (such as a God is referred to sometimes as a person) but while persons can be many things one of them is human. So if one is a human then they are a person (as all humans are persons in any dictionary you look at). The basic logic and understanding would lead one to say that all humans are person but not all persons are humans. So since a fetus is a human it is a person. The fetus's ability to make a choice is irrelevant just like the ability of a 1 second old baby who can't make a choice is irrelevant. They should both be afforded the ability be alive until they can make a choice for themselves. Pro-choice really means limited choice. The choice comes down to making a choice for another.\nHuman is the broadest category (including all the cells of our body being human cells). Next comes \"person\" which implies that there is \"someone home\" - a mental existance - in the common useage of the term person. People who are conscious and able to make any decisions are a subcategory of person. So, a newly fertilized egg is human but not a person. In my view, a very late term fetus is a person but not yet capable of making decisions (but still having rights as a person). Severelly mentally handicapped people are people, but simply not people who are able to make decisions well.",

   "In case you haven't noticed, your opinion of me means squat to me. IMO, you're \"Chicken Little\" running around telling people that having a baby is some great risk so that you can justify \"in your mind\" being pro-abortion when, in fact, the risks of death to the mother are slight. The risk to an aborted fetus is, however, ~100%. \n I've posted the reasons that women seeking an abortion have given and I promise you that their health was at the bottom of the list. Your argument is, therefore, a red herring. The statistics show that the overwhelming majority of women getting abortions do so for reasons OTHER THAN health. Do I need to repost the link to you or do you recall the several times that I quoted them? emoticon_frazzled\n\n \n However if you back track through this latest argument, I am not going rounds with you about being pro-life. Nor am I talking about what is or is not justificiation for abortion. I just wanted to know why you need to trivialize pregnancy.\n \n Phantos is pro-life and gets what I am saying.\n \n I know why you are pro-life, you know why I am not. I have no interest in going round the table with you on the subject again, we aren't changing each other's minds.\n \n I was 100% responding to a single statement you made that implied women go through very little in being pregnant. You alone brought up fatality stats. Something doesn't have to be killing you for it be a big deal and I just don't understand why you trivialize what women go through. It's as though any kind of acknowledgment or help to a pregnant woman (unless she be your wife) is a threat to your point of view. I really am baffled by it.",
