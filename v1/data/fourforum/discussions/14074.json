It is kind of a moot point though...if you can't afford the $5,000 (for the sake of argument) per employee for health care offered to big business then who cares if small business has $6,000. Small businesses just earn less, give smaller salaries, and have smaller margins or less profits.

Is Daewoo really the only other one on this forum capable of thinking outside what they read on Huffington Post/Drudge Report?\n \n In any event, Obama talked about how the exchanges were a Heritage Foundation idea. It was fact checked below. I generally agree with what Politifact says although Obama did make it misleading for someone that just heard it in passing. \n PolitiFact | Obama says Heritage Foundation is source of health exchange idea\n Heritage responded as well:\n Heritage President Ed Feulner Responds to President Obama?s Claims | The Foundry: Conservative Policy News.\n \n As many of you know Exchanges were used in Massachusetts. I haven't studied too much about what happened in Massachusetts but they do have ridiculous premium prices. Some say it is the highest in the country but according to this it is about the same as states around it..or a little higher:\n http://www.ahipresearch.org/pdfs/2009IndividualMarketSurveyFinalReport.pdf\n Still one of the highest in the country.\n \n Of course in Massachusetts almost everyone is covered but that also means everyone covered doesn't mean reduced share by those already paying insurance.\n \n So it gets back to the real problem which is we have exchanges but this does nothing to reduce costs and exchanges don't appear to have any effect on anything!\n \n Feel free to care about whats in the bill everyone.",

   "IMO, we should have a program analogous to the assigned risk pool for auto insurance.

You might have some arguments for risk pools and exchanges that would remove the huge spike in premiums should you get something that isn't treatable over one year (such as cancer) and thus your premiums would be too much to pay but overall it seems to miss you boat on costs. It doesn't appear that Massachusetts benefited from any \"exchanges\" other than have most people covered. There is also some evidence that it hurt small businesses and stunted growth (granted it hasn't been that long so I'm not totally convinced)",

   "I have been lambasted in the past over this issue, but I still don't believe insurance companies have any business in National Health Care and that drug manufacturing should be allowed to sell drugs anywhere in the world less than offered in the U.S. The health of the citizens in this country is to important to let special interest dictate policy. I am among the fortunate in that I'm retired, and for those that imply and write how bad government is about getting your Social Security checks to you, or, Medicare fighting over a procedure your doctors recommends, and how bad the USPS is.... I have never received my check late, had a medical procedure refused or not paid for, and last but not least, never not received a bill from the USPS. If any of you take the time to Google countries that offer some sort of a National Health Care to their citizens, you will find we are the only \"civilized country\" to not offer it, yet we want to dictate morals and values to the rest of the world. In realty, if we had a National Health Care program, you would probable find half those over 60 years of age would have just retired in this economic downturn, (this would decrease the unemployment rate by more then a percent or two) but with the cost of even hanging onto Cobra plans, it's out of reach when no money is coming in.
