Genesis creation/Noah if read litterally conflicts its self. You have to define first what you think Genesis is saying then compare it. Otherwise even natural selection and micro evolution is wrong too. \n \n Some religions cut genesis up to make it work, but even that is frowned on. The general stance of my religion is that genesis really didn't happen even thought we talk about it like it did. It soundsweird, but when you constantly say this was \"not a literal\" you are saying that is a metaphor that did not happen, for if it was literal it actually did happen. Other religions should take note of that.",

As for Genesis and evolution, the two are not necessarily in conflict. It depends on how one defines evolution. It depends on how you read Genesis. I believe in a specific creation by God. I also think the process of natural selection occurs, although I don't see the creation of new species and new lineages as a result of it. Others do, but in rare and special cases.\n \n The jury is out for me right now. I will have to research more and come back.",
