   "[quote]To what extent do you believe Church and State should be separated?[quote]\n \n The \"separation of church and state\" within the US does not exist in our constitution. The constitution was written tosay that the government shall make no law abridging the freedom of religion or establishing a religion. \n \n The intention was to keep government out of religion. There was no intention to keep religion out of government. Had that been the case the constituion would have read \"none of the three branches of government may entertain religious ideals from any faction.\" The constitution was very clearly written in a one sided fashion. It was meant to protect peoples religious freedom, not the government from religion.\n \n No the government should not invest itself in the machinations of religion. However, religious entities, of all faiths, (including christian by the way) have much to contribute to the governmental processes. \n \n I think had an actual \"separation\" been the intent this country would have not lasted long.",

   "The laws that govern this land have been modified and streched so far that the true intention is clouded. Atesis say the founding fathers mean this and christians say they ment the opposite. I think if we were to remove all the subscript to the consitition we may see things in a new light. To Mr. letgo I would say there is no morality outside of the law. The legislators job is to define morality, and the judical job is to enforce morality. The entirety of government is to decide what is right and wrong. As for your own home the Bill of rights amendment 4 dicates your security to privacy. The government has no right to enter your home without evidence of your wrong doing. This law also has been abused but lets stick to one at a time. The legislators repersent the people in the states they govern. If the people who elected them believe god to dicate morality they have a duty to bring that judgement of the people before the floor in laws and votes for or against laws. Therefore the masses decide which religion the government will hold. If christian elcet christians to vote as christian then the sway of the country will be christian, as it was very early. Recently false christians have taken power elected by false christians or humanists, and the sway of our country is moving away from it's christian roots.\n \n \n As for seperation of Church and State. there is no statement of such law found in any document of the laws. It was referd to brefily in an address to congress, but thrown out because it can be to easily mis understud, as it is now. As a Christian I don't recomend this but as an American I must say - If you don't want christian morality in your laws then don't elect christians to office.",

   "I think the modern idea of separation of church and state goes back to the dissenters of England and Scotland in the 1600s\n \n The Stewart monarchs James I, and Charles I used the pulpit to promote government... the Church of England being established as the church of the state. And when Charles I attempted to impose this sort of structure on Scotland it lead to the Bishops War (which itself lead to the Civil Wars).*\n \n In some societies past and present the Church is the State.\n \n The Vatican City being the most notable (it being descendant from the medieval Papal States).\n \n Iran has attempted to be a theistic state. So has Afghanistan and to a lesser degree Pakistan. In the 600s Muhammed was both leader of his people politically and spiritually.\n \n Bhutan, and Tibet** are other cases.\n \n *As far as politics is concerned, the Bible can be used to support two opposing systems:\n \n William Allan (i.e. Edward Sexby) writing in 1657 (\"Killing Noe Murder. Briefly Discourst in Three Quaestions\" -this is the correct spelling for this title) argued that as God was immediately above a man, in spiritual life, so should it be in politics; he then went so far as to suggest that it was therefore okay to kill 'tyrants'. (Such an attitude should be familiar to most American gun-owners).\n \n Thus you can use religion to justify a political system\n \n **Not since 1950 when China invaded",
