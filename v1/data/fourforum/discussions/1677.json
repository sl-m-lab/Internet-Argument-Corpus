   "by Dave Chandler \n \n Let us 'remember' .... \n \n Less than one year ago, George W. Bush knew the truth: Iraq posed no weapons of mass destruction threat. He knew because that is what the United Nations weapons inspectors were telling him and the whole world. Yet Bush clung to what he knew was a lie. He was not misled by American intelligence -- he decided to use the lie and start a war. \n \n Since the beginning of the year, there have been momentous developments in the tale about why George Bush ordered the unprovoked attack, invasion, and occupation of Iraq. These days may be remembered as the point when the American people started to come to the realization that when Bush was confronted with the decision to choose war or peace -- he, and he alone, by virtue of his office -- betrayed the republic on what is the gravest action a nation can take, to make war. \n \n In this month, January 2004, has come the insightful report of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace that meticulously compared the \"pre-war intelligence, the official presentation of that intelligence, and what is now known about Iraq's programs.\" There has been the release of Ron Susskind's book \"The Price of Loyalty\" about former Bush administration Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and his contention that: \"From the very beginning, there was a conviction that Saddam Hussein was a bad person and that he needed to go.\" And, we have heard the astonishing revelation by resigned chief US weapons searcher in Iraq, David Kay, that: \"I don't think they existed ... What everyone was talking about is stockpiles produced after the end of the last (1991) Gulf War, and I don't think there was a large-scale production program in the nineties.\" \n \n Yet in light of these reports and disclosures, when now asked about whether he believes the weapons of mass destruction (WMD) will be found, the very casus belli for the war, Bush does not answer the question. His reply references only his mental state at the time he launched his \"shock and awe\" attack: \"There is no doubt in my mind that Saddam Hussein was a gathering threat to America and others.\" \n \n But what was in Bush's mind and the facts on the ground in Iraq were not the same thing. The question around the world and in the United Nations in March 2003, was did Bush really have concrete, substantial, and significant information on which to start a war? \n \n The answer to that life and death question, and what ultimately exposes the lie that Bush used to begin the killing, can be found in the simple act of ... 'remembering'. \n \n 'Remembering' is something that Bush is going to increasingly not want Americans to do. Two weeks before Bush ordered the unprovoked attack on Iraq, he held a press conference to set out his justifications for the use of force. Here are a couple of particularly salient Bush remarks to 'remember': \n \n \"If the Iraqi regime were disarming, we would know it because we would see it. Iraq's weapons would be presented to inspectors and the world would witness their destruction.\" \n \n \"There's a lot of talk about inspectors. It would have taken a handful of inspectors to determine whether he was disarming. They could've showed up at a parking lot and he could've brought his weapons and destroyed them.\" \n \n \n http://www.earthside.com/remember.html \n \n When George W. Bush started the war with Iraq, in defiance of the truth at hand, he betrayed America and what had been our unique special place in history ... and he betrayed the cause of decent humanity on the planet Earth. \n \n On election day, this, you must 'remember'.",

The Iraqi regime didn't eliminate its production capability. They didn't eliminate their seed strains. They didn't destroy they dispersal capability. Etc, etc, etc, etc.\n\n \n You will note that they dropped off on the whole drone issue. This is because they found that with the additional weight added, the drones were well inside the restraints of the restrictions. Additionally, the control systems installed for the drones did not allow for weapons deployment. \n \n ??ricin??\n \n WMD research should read \"possible WMD research facilities\". My garage is a possible WMD research facility. My basement might be considered a \"hidden laboratory (I have an old centerfuge down there and some glassware).\n \n Nuclear testing facilities=not banned. Nuclear weapons research=banned. If you have a quote/link from an authorative source that claimes the nuke testing/research they found was not energy related, please provide it. Nuke testing facilities are not hard to find, they can even be tracked by satelite. The UN inspection team cleared all known nuke facilities.\n \n No centrifuges. Some arguments about certain components. Scintific analysis showed they were not suitable for use. Plans can be downloaded from internet. It is also interesting to note that when asked to provide the seized plans for inspection, it was not done.\n \n WMD seed strains.....You are talking about anthrax cultures and some other disease cultures. It is not suprising that the found some of these. They would find the same in many/most medical research facilities. Also, not banned. Pull a copy of the UN weapons inspectors report, they touch on the topic briefly.\n \n I have a bioreactor in my barn. It is used for distilling methanol from wood pulp. Every pharmaceutical company in the world owns hundreds of them, most universities also have several. You can also find them in many hospitals.\n \n Empty chemical shells, contents presumably destroyed (at least according to the several truckloads of documents provided to the UN before the war). in accordance to the security council resolution.\n \n At one time I believed, just like you, that the stuff was there and we would find it. If the stuff was really there, don't you think that difinitive proof would have been provided by now, with the entire world looking on and calling the US warmongering liars?\n \n When you consider the facts, it doesn't add up. IMHO, the US figured out very early on that we were wrong about the WMD's. This is why we decided to have our people do the inspections without international oversight. This is also why we don't see \"secret labs\" and WMD production facilities ont he news. They are stretching the truth like a 500 lb woman trying to get into a spandex loetard.\n \n It just doesn't add up. I especially liked the way they classified the initial report fromt he inspection team. It was not that they classified it that set off alarm bells in my head, it was the fact that they classified it to the point that even those who wrote it were not allowed to see it. I have worked on enough goverment projects to know that this means they plan to re-write it, and they don't want the original authors going \"that's not what I said\". Even corporate America knows this trick. I have done it myself. This is why the international community was sceptical of the report. Every government in the world is privy to that trick.",
