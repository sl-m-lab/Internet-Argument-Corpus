We just think that people should pay for their use of the commonwealth -\n\n \n Then why do so few welfare recipients pay taxes? The neighbor that I used to have and whom I have described in another thread has not worked more than 3 weeks in the whole 5 years that I have known her. She has no taxable income. But she allows her siblings to claim her 3 children as dependents so they can get the child income tax deduction. They in turn give her part of what the government rebates to them for her children- which may mean she has taxable income that she is not reporting to the government.\n \n Back when my mother owned her neighborhood grocery store a lot of people who lived in the area and who did not work for a living would beg her to hire them for a few days so they could get the earned-income child credit, i.e., an income tax refund on income taxes they never paid to begin with.\n \n So don't tell me that welfare recipients pay their fair share of taxes. \n \n \nand obviously the rich have benefited the most so they are obligated to pay their share.\n\n \n How so?\n \n \nI think that history revealed that Bill Clinton cut governmental spending and balanced the budget. \n\n \n Only with Republican majorities in both Houses of Congress- and only after allowing the government to be shut down because he wanted to play politics.\n \n \nGeorge W. Bush and Dick Cheney are the fellows who hiked governmental spending and pushed us into huge deficits.\n\n \n Except for the few years when the Republicans in Congress balanced the budget, deficit spending has been a way of life since at least the early 1970s.\n \n \nBush/Cheney also managed to weaken our military by sending them into unnecessary wars that were not properly planned and failing to give our military the material support they needed in warfare.\n\n \n The wars were necessary, but unfortunately GWB and Co. didn't have the political will to win them.\n \n \nAbortion should be a matter of privacy and making private choices, not having the state and church dictate one's destiny to women only.\n\n \n Abortion is a moral issue in that it always results in the loss of human life.\n \n My mother had a deformed uterus and was unable to carry a baby to term. But she was pregnant at age 16 anyway. She was told to expect a stillbirth. I was born 10 weeks premature in 1968- weighing less 3 pounds, 6 ounces and had to spend the first 2 months of my life (almost to the hour) before I weighed the 5 pounds minimum to be allowed to go home. In another place or time I could have been legally killed in the womb.\n \n \nMarriage for sodomites? Does that mean that heterosexual couples who engage in sodomy should have their marriages dissolved?\n\n \n The act of Sodomy is against nature, thus society has a right to ban it.\n \n \nI am not convinced that conservatives are opposed to the UN.\n\n \n I didn't say they are, but if you had read my post, you'd know this. \n \n \nLiberals do not believe in governmental control over production. Markets need to be regulated in order to provide a fair playing field with no market manipulation.\n\n \n Funny, this is the conservative position.\n \n \nLiberals are opposed to corporations that are \"too big to fail,\" which means that taxpayer dollars are going to be spent by so-called conservatives to keep these \"too big to fail\" corporations afloat.\n\n \n Again, you are describing the conservative position.\n \n All-in-all you are just giving me a shopping list of your preferred policies.

   "I agree that the individual has an obligation to society, but that doesn't equate to society having a right to regulate personal morality. Society has a right to take steps to limit the harm an individual does to others, or to themselves if they are incapable of making sound judgements. Drugs cause significant harm to individuals and to those around them, so it is reasonable for society to take steps to limit that harm, particularly as addiction affects one's ability to reason. Sex, between consenting adults, is not objectively harmful, and society's ability to limit sex should be restricted to areas where there is demonstrable harm, e.g. where minors are involved, pornography, prostitution and rape. I believe that adultery and fornication, and divorce, are wrong, and I don't engage in them. That is a matter of personal morality, however, not a matter for society to regulate. Whether somebody chooses to practice \"sodomy\" is likewise a matter of personal morality, not objective societal harm. Let's not forget that oral and anal sex, along with pretty much anything except missionary vaginal sex, were covered by anti-sodomy laws in US states.
