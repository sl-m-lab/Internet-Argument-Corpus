   "Our resident denier posted This Link from Conservapedia, \"The Trustworthy Encyclopedia\" to show that \"the scientific theory of evolution and all of the supporting material that endorses it ... not one aspect of it have, or ever will be proven by its proponents.\"\n \n I just took a quick glance at it, and plan to rip it to shreds in the next couple days, but this is just apalling all around. For example, from the link:\n \n \nSince World War II a majority of the most prominent and vocal defenders of the theory of evolution which employs methodological naturalism have been atheists.[2][3]\n\n See the little 2 and 3 at the end? Yeah, those are footnotes. This apparent factoid is based on articles by Don Batten (he lists 11 atheists over the past 50 years who were/are pretty vocal about promoting evolution), and Chapter 1 of a book by Jonathon Safarti, where he claims that evolution only makes sense if viewed through an atheist bias. If viewed with the proper (ie creationist) bias, then the truth (Creationism is Troo!) is revealed.\n \n And my favorite line so far (only read the first paragraph so far) is this:\n \nthere are many who are against the theory of evolution and state there are many problems with the theory of evolution.\n\n No biggie, right? Typical creationist \"teach the controversy\" stuff. But wait! The \"encyclopedia\" follows this up with it's damning evidence to show the many holes in the ToE! Read on evolutionists, and despair!!\n \nFor example, an article by CBS News begins with the observation that, \"Americans do not believe that humans evolved, and the vast majority says that even if they evolved, God guided the process. Just 13 percent say that God was not involved.\"[4]\n\n Yup, that's the best shot they got apparently. With an introduction like that, I was expecting a boatload of arguments to follow. but no, instead we get \"CBS news had a poll that said only 13% of people believed god was not involved. Yeah, this is the introduction, but really, an example of the problems in the ToE is the results of a CBS poll?!?\n \n Oy... and people complain about wikipedia?\n \n So, anyone want to take a section and address it?",

   "First section:\n \n Mutations and the Life Sciences in General\n \n Pierre Grasse's quotes look pretty damning - until you return them to the context from which they have been abstracted. He was passing commentary on the dangers of complacently believing that we had all the answers regarding the process of evolution. In the same book he also states:\n \n \nZoologists and botanists are nearly unanimous in considering evolution as a fact and not a hypothesis. I agree with this position and base it primarily on documents provided by paleontology, i.e., the history of the living world ... [Also,] Embryogenesis provides valuable data [concerning evolutionary relationships] ... Chemistry, through its analytical data, directs biologists and provides guidance in their search for affinities between groups of animals or plants, and ... plays an important part in the approach to genuine evolution.\n\n \n Then there's Ernst Mayr, speaking in 1942 about how the improvement of complex structures like the eye via random mutation strained credulity. This quote predates a great deal of our modern understanding of how such structures may evolve gradually via intermediate forms - forms which can still be seen in a variety of creatures today, as illustrated here. It would be remarkable, to say the least, if the correlation between these progressively more complex eye-forms and the genetically implied shared ancestry of the creatures that bear them were to be a product of pure chance.\n \n Then there's this nugget:\n \nCreation scientists assert that the homology argument is not a valid argument.\n\n with a link to a page explaining why genetic homologies between creatures with physical homologies is equally well explained by creation as by evolution. Unsurprisingly, no mention is made of the broken and non-functional genetic homologies between species, which cannot be explained by a creation hypothesis, only by shared ancestry.\n \n \n What a thoroughly depressing site.\n \n There's a great bit on another page about continental drift, and how YECs are successfully challenging the idea that it took place over hundreds of millions of years - completely glossing over the fact that for years and years YECs insisted that there was no continental drift. \n \n But it gets better. The evidence cited for continental 'sprinting' is that the magnetic striping evident in rock strata, indicative of reversals of the earth's magnetic field, is being wrongly dated. Again, no mention is made of the fact that YEC's once fought tooth and nail to deny that magnetic reversals occurred at all, because at the time they were basing their 10,000 year estimate on an arbitrary exponential decay estimate of the earth's magnetic field strength since creation - which of course reversals totally scupper.\n \n So now that denying reversals is no longer an option, they say they happen quickly rather than the thousands of years the evidence seems to suggest. They cite scientifically confirmed evidence of a reversal occurring within just 15 days!\n \n Of course, when you actually look at the evidence, what it describes is not a rapid reversal, but a rapid variation of the field within a reversal. Asked if creationists were misusing his work, one of the authors replied:\n \n \n\"Yes, that is unfortunate because the rapid-field-change hypothesis offers no basis for any of their stuff. Insofar as there is any evidence for the duration of the Steens polarity transition, from estimates of rates of SV, it is several thousand years. The question we examine is whether the systematic streaking of directions of samples as a function of height in a single flow could have been caused by an EPISODE of rapid movement of field direction while that flow was cooling through its blocking temperatures. We state as much in everything we have written, but they ignore that.\"\n\n \n So what we have here is a lie, based on a distortion, which is itself a fallback position from a fallback position from a fallback position from an evidence-free made-up graph about the magnetic age of the earth. And creationists say the truth is constant... ;)",

   "It's fascinating stuff. I have to watch myself, though: it's easy to fall into the same trap as Archangel and start inventing conspiracies, start demonising 'the enemy'. I've done it already in this thread:\n \nSo what we have here is a lie, based on a distortion, which is itself a fallback position from a fallback position from a fallback position from an evidence-free made-up graph about the magnetic age of the earth. And creationists say the truth is constant... \n\n It's so darn easy and tempting to think like that, to take the end result of many stages of investigation, interpretation, communication - and treat it as the product of one consciousness, some coherent unit labelled 'creationists'. But that's excessive and unfair.\n \n What permits these notions to thrive and solidify are the little things: the counterargument not mentioned when relating a debate to a friend, the detail omitted by someone who does not appreciate its significance - even the speed at which 'acceptable' interpretations diffuse through a community compared to less acceptable ones. The extended creationist community - and I stress extended, loose, casual, informal, happenstance - is really just a big filter.\n \n The creationist 'side' does have one major inherent advantage over science: it has no real need to filter obsolete arguments out of the system. The 'truth' they have to preserve lies outside the shifting justifications used to shore it up, whereas most of the accumulated value of science lies in the theories, not the conclusions. It's hard to think of a single creationist justification, no matter how hackneyed, or how thoroughly and repeatedly debunked, or even disowned by sites like AiG, that isn't still in circulation, clogging up minds and forums alike. Continents don't move. The earth wouldn't still be magnetic if it was as old as they say. They've found dinosaur bones with soft tissue inside.\n \n Science has to work with what it has, regardless of whether it's counterintuitive, difficult to follow, or requires a bit of lateral thinking. Creationism on the other hand gets all the good soundbites: \"What use is half an eye?\" \"If we're descended from chimps, why are there still chimps?\" \"You can't have a watch without a watchmaker, and a living thing is much more complicated than a watch\". You don't have to think to agree with rhetoric like that, and if all you need to do to carry on believing exactly what mummy and daddy and the big serious man in church taught you is not think, well... it's certainly tempting. It's encouraging, though, how few creationists choose to remain satisfied with that level of rationalisation.\n \n The more I think about it, the more remarkable it seems that reason prevails as often as it does. Perhaps it's because science produces all the results. Creationism doesn't really achieve anything; it's a strident and vigorous engine devoted to the principle of staying where you are. Adherents get a continual payoff, the reaffirmation that they're right, but not much else. Science gets all the cool new toys, makes sick people better - and predicts things correctly, which is something we get an instinctive buzz out of. Watch any baby learning 'boo' and you can see it.",
