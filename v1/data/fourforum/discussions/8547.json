The dealer removes a cup that doesn't have the coin behind it (and not the cup that the player has chosen.)

And you got 50-50 because when you make the second choice there are only two cups left?

Instead of three cups and the dealer takes away one, let's have 100 cups and the dealer takes away 98. You still end up with two cups at the end, so it looks just like the previous case.

The more cups there are the more likely you are to be wrong, as the above example illustrates. You know you're probably wrong, and then the dealer gives you more info by saying \"the ball wasn't under this cup\". Your first choice is probably wrong, and the deal then eliminates all the other cups but one. Therefore, you're most likely to win if you switch.

And of course, it is EF who is correct and the dozen or so programmers who programmed the problem, many of whom had taken statistics courses and some of whom were engineers and math majors, are all wrong, at least in his mind.\n \n Try again, EF. Check the Wikipedia link above. Maybe you will be able to pay attention long enough to understand the explanation there. I quote, \"Many people incorrectly assume since there are only two doors left after the host opens one, that the remaining doors must have equal probability. However, assuming the host knows what is behind each door, always opens a door revealing a goat, and always makes the offer to switch, the host's actions do not affect the probability of the player initially choosing the car (1/3). This means the answer is yes - switching results in the chances of winning the car improving from 1/3 to 2/3.\"\n \n and later in the explanation, \"The answer to the problem is yes; the chance of winning the car is doubled when the player switches to another door rather sticking with the original choice.\"\n \n But of course, EF ignores the initial choice, and ignores the opening of one door and begins the problem with a choice between two doors.\n \n By the way, EF. It isn't really a big deal to program such a problem. There aren't any dependant events. The program randomly picks a target door, reseeds the random number generator and then randomly picks one of the three doors. After that, all you have to do is count the hits. Some of us even reseeded the random number generator to begin, selected the first door, then reseeded the random number generator to get a random time delay before reseeding the random number generator for the second selection.",
