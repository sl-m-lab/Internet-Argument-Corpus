There is no practical difference between one 30-round magazine and three 10-round magazines because it&#8217;s easy to reload quickly.

   "Have you forgotten the Mumbai massacre already? The killing of German school students? Any killing at any gun free zone in the country? The Mexican drug cartel acquiring machine guns despite the 1986 ban on them in this country?\n\n Cherry picking won't cover up the fact that in general developed nations with strict levels of gun control have much lower gun crime rates than the US. You're missing the big picture. Besides, the shooter of German school students got the gun from his father's legally owned gun collection.\n \n \n\n Cars are a privilege, your gun isn't. Show me evidence that would support the registration of your first amendment rights being constitutional.\n\n There is a right to own property and to travel as recognized by the US Supreme Court.\n \n \n\n Germany, Africa, China, Japan, Australia, United Kingdom, Turkey, etc.\n\n Huh?\n \n \n\n I think it's fair. The pro-gun side has a consistent history of being in favor of protecting individual rights against collective entities like government and big businesses.\n The gun-ban side has a consistent history of being in favor of the removal of individual rights and trying to criminalize lawful behavior because they don't like it.\n \n If you can't stand the heat then stay out of the furnace!\n\n The pro gun-control side tries to protect individual rights from being violated by criminals. In contrast, the pro-gun side is more interested in protecting the profits of the gun industry. \n \n \n \n \n\n Even if the number of defensive uses is only 800,000 a year, that's still a rate of more than 53 to 1 when compared to the number of homicides committed with a firearm.\n \n \n \n Kleck was a supporter of the anti-gun position. But then he decided to go and commit the ultimate sin that a liberal could: he began to think in a logical and questioning manner. If he could learn the error of his ways, why can't you?\n \n Even if the number of defensive uses is only 100,000 that's still more than 6 to 1 when compared to the number of people murdered every year.\n\n Bad comparisons. A fair comparison would be comparing the total number of defensive gun uses to the total number of gun crimes (not just limiting it to gun homicides).\n \n \n\n Anyone can acquire arms from the black market, but we choose not to because we have legal alternatives. Take those legal alternatives away and it'll be nothing more than a nation of several hundred million criminals.\n\n Yes, just like banning marijuana in the 1930s has turned this nation into a nation of several hundred million criminals. \n \n \n\n I'm sure they're concerned about the intended victim with the shotgun or the rifle just as much.\n\n You're just guessing and it's not very good guessing either. \n \n \n\n Sarah Brady is a straw purchaser then. She knowingly broke the law by buying a gun for somebody else instead of letting them go through the NICS check system. Who knows what else she's done and who she's supplied guns to.\n\n She didn't buy a gun for a criminal. \n \n \n\n Not everyone agrees with policy. Afterall look at the Brady Campaign, one of their long time members was leaking classified information to the NRA and other pro-gun groups on purpose.\n\n So? The point was that people who support gun control are not necessarily communists.\n \n \n \n\n Evidence please.\n\n I found this:\n \"Public opinion polls show that Americans strongly support licensing laws. A nationwide poll conducted in May of 2001 found that 85% of respondents- including 73% of gun owners- favored laws requiring handgun purchasers to obtain a permit before buying a handgun.\"\n http://www.lcav.org/content/licensing_gun_owners_purchasers.pdf\n \n \n\n Plague ships weren't protected under the Second Amendment during colonial days. This was the closest thing there was to a WMD, Americans could've used them do devastate Britain and kill everyone. So why wasn't the possession of plague infested ships protected?\n\n Evidence of plague infested ships being used as weapons?\n \n \n \n \n\n You can put whatever spin on this that you want. But no matter how much you try, the number of rounds discharged is always the same. Trying to limit it to multiple magazines instead of just one serves no practical purpose.\n\n So you agree that it's not necessary to have high capacity magazines because gun owners can reload quickly when defending themselves against a criminals. Good we can agree on at least one thing. \n \n \n \n\n And then we point to Israel, where armed teachers have been responsible for a considerable drop in school shootings\n\n Evidence?\n \n \n\n Maybe all public speakers and blog owners should be required to undertake federally mandated remedial speaking and typing courses, even if they have a college education, and pass an extensive testing program to prove that they won't get their words wrong...like the Illinois reverend who publicly and vocally advocated the killing of gun store owners and politicians who didn't support gun control.\n\n LOL! By that logic children entering a school with substandard English skills are just as much a threat to others as armed children entering a school with no training in firearms. \n \n \n\n BBC NEWS | UK | England | Wear | Second Pc held in gun sale probe\n \n MoD has 'lost' 165 pistols, rifles and machine guns... and 27,000 rounds of ammunition | Mail Online\n \n LiveLeak.com - Buying an Uzi in the UK- No Problem!\n\n Once again, cherry picking and ignoring the big picture which is that the UK's gun crime rate is much lower.\n \n \n \n\n So now we're embracing the concept that the victims of brutal stabbings are less important than those who've been shot to death?\n\n Diversionary tactic. The point is that it's harder to kill with the other weapons mentioned.\n \n \n \n\n Felony possession of a firearm is five years in prison. Gun trafficking is ten years per gun. Murder brings the death penalty. None of these punishments are handed down for the crimes that get committed.\n \n It's a matter of quantity over quality.\n\n And yet the US still has a much higher gun crime rate despite having a very high incarceration rate compared to other developed nations with a lot less gun violence. Get a clue. \n \n \n \n\n There is no evidence to support the claim that the entire Iraq population was at any point heavily armed and capable of overthrowing a dictator.\n\n \"Iraq, one of the most heavily armed countries in the world, is believed to harbor enough guns to arm every one of its 24 million citizens. Iraqi civilians also have access to other light weapons, such as rocket- propelled grenades, mortars, and bombs - making their arsenals potentially more deadly.\n \n \"In the absence of a governing force in Iraq, some Iraqis are looking to increase their personal weapons caches in order to protect themselves from looters and roving armed gangs; others want small arms to conduct illegal activities and gain political power. Reports have surfaced that gun merchants have set up shop on the streets of Baghdad, selling AK-47s for as little as $10.\"\n War ends, but Iraq battle over small arms just begins | csmonitor.com\n \n In this thread I was told that handguns were useful in combating tyranny-\n http://www.4forums.com/political/gun-control-debates/11746-second-amendment-no-longer-relevant.html\n \n So I'm supposed to believe that handguns are useful in battling tyranny but not having numerous amounts of the above weapons? Shows how inconsistent people can be when it serves their agenda. \n \n \n\n Criminals continually inform the public that their greatest fear is a victim capable of fighting back against them and possibly killing them.\n\n And that fear could motivate the criminals to be armed themselves- thus putting the public in more danger. Such a fear could start an arms race. Try looking at the big picture.\n \n \n \n\n There is no room for sellouts.\n\n In other words, you think there is no room for moderates. But the real world is not so black and white and compromise is often necessary. \n \n \n\n Many of the gun hating crowd also own guns. It's the elitism belief, that they're superior to all humans and thus deserve to be armed, while everyone else in the world should be unarmed and bow before them as if they're gods.\n \n\n Makes about as much sense as saying many of the car hating crowd (people who support such laws as car registration) also own cars. More evidence that your handlers have trained you to see the world in black and white. \n \n \n\n We aren't defending guns. We're defending the right to be armed.\n\n So having guns is not part of being armed?",

   "by mischaracterizing and equating a clearly stated RIGHT by equating it with a political position or a choice. The Second Amendment is NOT a choice in this Republic where the Rule of Law, the Constitution is the Supreme Law of the Land. It is deemed a pre-existing right and stated as such in the preamble of the Bill of Rights and the absolute bar against any government infringement. It is not open to amendment as the first 10 Amendments are part of the Constitution itself and a compact with the people, and States who would never have adopted it without those safeguards.\n \n Pro rights means that you accept this law. Anti rights is the correct term for those who do not and simply want to pick and choose their idea of what should be in the fantasy 'living Constitution'. Even Roe v. Wade used \"rights as those found in the first 8 Amendments\", specifically mentioning the right to keep and bear arms to try to justify abortion which is, as they declared, \"an unalienable right on par with other rights not enumerated\"... in Justice Sandra Day O'Conner's synopsis.\n \n Trying to diminish the enumerated RIGHT in the Second Amendment by the trivilizing term, \"pro gunner\" is demeaning to the Rule of Law and to the audience. It assumes that this is a Democracy and not a Republic and demonstrates yet another fallacy which must be assumed to exist before the claim can be made. Right thinking people should be embarrassed to equate such symbolism in public places. I do not accept the thesis of \"pro gunner\"! I stand on the thesis, PRO RIGHTS.\n \n Now can you giggle at that?",

   "Cherry picking won't cover up the fact that in general developed nations with strict levels of gun control have much lower gun crime rates than the US. You're missing the big picture. Besides, the shooter of German school students got the gun from his father's legally owned gun collection.\n\n \n Don't you dare try and give me a lecture about cherry picking! All you ever do is cherry pick! You come around about once a month, scour the news to find a crime committed with a gun, and you use that single incident as if it's evidence that there's a serious problem that threatens the entire nation. If that's not cherry picking then I don't know what is.\n \n \nThere is a right to own property and to travel as recognized by the US Supreme Court.\n\n \n As a gun owner I'm also a property owner. Or are you denying that guns are property?\n \n \nHuh?\n\n \n All of these nations have had one gun ban after another, after enacting registration schemes. Do you have the nerve to deny this fact?\n \n \nThe pro gun-control side tries to protect individual rights from being violated by criminals.\n\n \n Really? I haven't seen you post your support for any law or proposal that would punish criminals in the most severe ways possible. All I've ever seen you post support for is more laws that criminalize things that aren't crimes and do nothing to harm others.\n \n \nIn contrast, the pro-gun side is more interested in protecting the profits of the gun industry.\n\n \n Then maybe you can present some evidence to support this argument of yours. If we're protecting the profits of big companies, then where are our kickbacks? Where are our millions in bribes from companies like Glock or Smith & Wesson?\n \n \nBad comparisons. A fair comparison would be comparing the total number of defensive gun uses to the total number of gun crimes (not just limiting it to gun homicides).\n\n \n Kellerman wasn't fair when he did the comparisons for his study, don't get upset when I use the same standard of review against you.\n \n \nYes, just like banning marijuana in the 1930s has turned this nation into a nation of several hundred million criminals.\n\n \n I always find it amazing when an argument like this comes up. People like you have continually argued that the war on drugs was a mistake, that it was a waste, that it's produced no benefit and that it should be done away with so people can smoke pot and do crack to their heart's content.\n \n Yet when it comes to gun ownership, somehow the same standards and tactics are supposed to magically work and produce great benefits that we simply can't live without.\n \n \nYou're just guessing and it's not very good guessing either.\n\n \n Then why aren't police armed exclusively with handguns?\n \n \nShe didn't buy a gun for a criminal.\n\n \n Strawman argument. Under the anti-gun standard of review, a straw purchase involves buying a gun for anyone other than yourself, with no exceptions.\n \n \nI found this:\n \"Public opinion polls show that Americans strongly support licensing laws. A nationwide poll conducted in May of 2001 found that 85% of respondents- including 73% of gun owners- favored laws requiring handgun purchasers to obtain a permit before buying a handgun.\"\n http://www.lcav.org/content/licensing_gun_owners_purchasers.pdf\n\n \n I see no evidence that this is reliable. Where's the proof that this isn't just another cherry picked article, made up from the polling of people who live in states like California, New York, New Jersey, Illinois and other such communist territories?\n \n Furthermore, where's the proof that these people are true and genuine gun owners?\n \n \nSo you agree that it's not necessary to have high capacity magazines because gun owners can reload quickly when defending themselves against a criminals. Good we can agree on at least one thing.\n\n \n This isn't my position. I'm arguing that your attempts to demonize magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds is foolish. Furthermore, if no honest citizen needs a 15 round magazine, then no police officer needs them either. If we can reload them quickly enough for it to not matter, then the police can do it too.\n \n \nEvidence?\n\n \n In time of war: The Israeli answer to terrorism by Massad Ayoob Issue #81\n \n \"Israel began the program of armed citizen guards in the schools after the Maalot massacre in the 1970s, when a large number of children were slain in a terrorist incident. The volunteer parents work in plain clothes, armed with concealed semi-automatic pistols, and are trained by Israel&#8217;s home guard. It is significant that in the more than a quarter century between Maalot and the incident mentioned above when the citizen guards shot down the terrorist in the school in 2002, not a single child was murdered in an Israeli school!\"\n \n \nLOL! By that logic children entering a school with substandard English skills are just as much a threat to others as armed children entering a school with no training in firearms.\n\n \n The last time I checked it was a mandatory requirement for a CCW applicant to pass a certified training course.\n \n \nOnce again, cherry picking and ignoring the big picture which is that the UK's gun crime rate is much lower.\n\n \n Now look here, boy, I'm tired of you spreading this ignorant bull****. I came from the UK, I lived there most of my life, I saw the truth that you choose to ignore because it's inconvenient for you.\n \n The police have been caught intentionally miscounting the number of crimes reported by the people, they've been doing it for years. The people of the UK also don't report every instance of when they've been victimized. These two facts mean that any evidence you use to support your flawed position is untrustworthy and doctored to reflect whatever you want it to. You might as well be citing yourself!\n \n Even one of the biggest advocates of the post-Dunblane handgun ban admitted that the ban was a huge failure, because even school children were able to get access to guns and kill their classmates.\n \n Don't you ever spread this lie again, we know that there's no ounce of truth to it! And that's coming from a former subject of the UK, somebody who saw it first hand!\n \n \nDiversionary tactic. The point is that it's harder to kill with the other weapons mentioned.\n\n \n Diversionary tactic? Is that what you call it when somebody posts something you can't otherwise refute?\n \n The fact remains that someone can just as easily be killed with a knife or a bat or a hammer, as they can be with a gun. It doesn't matter if you're shot in the head, or stabbed in the heart, death is all the same.\n \n Your continued ignoring of those who've been stabbed and bludgeoned to death is disgraceful and you should be ashamed of yourself. You don't care about saving even a single life, all you care about is furthering your agenda! You're glad when you read about somebody being killed, it makes you happy because you can dance in their spilled blood and exploit a family's tragedy to further your own goals, come hell or high water!\n \n \nAnd yet the US still has a much higher gun crime rate despite having a very high incarceration rate compared to other developed nations with a lot less gun violence. Get a clue.\n\n \n 80% of all crimes are caused by one million violent gang members. Why are we allowing them to roam the streets freely?\n \n \n\"Iraq, one of the most heavily armed countries in the world\n\n \n SNIP\n \n This isn't evidence, this is an opinion piece made by someone with an agenda. Come back when you have something of substance.\n \n \nSo I'm supposed to believe that handguns are useful in battling tyranny but not having numerous amounts of the above weapons? Shows how inconsistent people can be when it serves their agenda.\n\n \n Your argument is moot. The Iraq population wasn't heavily armed, only the Taliban and soldiers.\n \n \nAnd that fear could motivate the criminals to be armed themselves- thus putting the public in more danger. Such a fear could start an arms race. Try looking at the big picture.\n\n \n Stop telling me to look at the big picture when you've had both of your eyes gouged out!\n \n Your entire statement here is beyond stupid. If the criminals felt that the only time to be armed was when their intended victims could fight back, then the criminals in DC would never be armed and the police wouldn't have needed to introduce gun shot sensors in the city. But since DC was the murder capital of the United States, that says an absence of hard targets isn't a guarantee that the abusers will play fair and not use weapons.\n \n \nIn other words, you think there is no room for moderates. But the real world is not so black and white and compromise is often necessary.\n\n \n No, there's no room for traitors. We don't need presidents of firearms manufacturing companies that made campaign contributions to Obama, or those who will immediately sign onto pointless programs just to avoid a lawsuit.\n \n \nMakes about as much sense as saying many of the car hating crowd (people who support such laws as car registration) also own cars. More evidence that your handlers have trained you to see the world in black and white. \n\n \n Rosie O'Donnell publicly stated that she felt anyone who owned a gun should be sent to prison. However she has armed bodyguards to protect herself and her children. Talk about a hypocritical sow.\n \n \nSo having guns is not part of being armed?\n\n \n Simply having them isn't the point. It's about being able to use them.",

One former NRA employee writes about the NRA's obsession with money and about why the NRA has powerful financial incentives not to compromise with gun control advocates:\n \n \"In 1984, I landed my dream job as Northeast regional representative of the NRA. I was a young lawyer, keen on politics and the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. This post promised to indulge both passions, and for a time it did. But soon enough, I was watching with growing dismay as the NRA morphed from a reasonable, responsible voice of sportsmen and firearms owners into a giant money machine that provides more benefits to its insiders than to its 3 million-plus members....\n \n \"In the NRA's lexicon, 'compromise' is a dirty word, code for gun owners' surrendering their rights while getting nothing in return from gun-control advocates. Compromise is all give and no get. That definition echoes and re-echoes in the NRA's fundraising letters, which whip the membership into the check-writing frenzy that built the association into the impressive grass-roots political juggernaut it is today....\n \n \"That's when I did the unforgivable, at least in the NRA's eyes: I found a workable solution to the problematic issue of child-safety locks on guns.\n \n \"I shortstopped proposed gun-lock legislation predicted to be another slam dunk for the anti-gun movement by offering an option that made everyone happy. Well, almost everyone. In the White House Rose Garden -- standing before the NRA's bete noire, President Bill Clinton -- I announced that the firearms industry was instituting a voluntary program to include a gun lock with every handgun sold. As the television news cameras rolled, Clinton announced that he was satisfied and that no mandatory gun-lock law was needed. But NRA commanders were up in arms. They denounced me as a traitor to the sacred cause of the Second Amendment. Compromise was not good for fundraising, the NRA's lifeblood.\n The NRA's Main Target? Its Members' Checkbooks\n \n \n\n Kellerman wasn't fair when he did the comparisons for his study, don't get upset when I use the same standard of review against you. I always find it amazing when an argument like this comes up. People like you have continually argued that the war on drugs was a mistake, that it was a waste, that it's produced no benefit and that it should be done away with so people can smoke pot and do crack to their heart's content. Yet when it comes to gun ownership, somehow the same standards and tactics are supposed to magically work and produce great benefits that we simply can't live without.\n\n Kellermann, in one of his studies, compared criminal homicides to legally justifiable homicides. He compared homicides to homicides (FBI data does the same) which seems more fair than your comparison- comparing only gun homicides to all types of crime supposedly prevented by crime according to one very controversial study. And I never said the war on drugs was a mistake.",

   "\n Then why aren't police armed exclusively with handguns?\n\n No continuity of thought here. The original point was- \"Through this elusive 'black market', criminals can acquire any types of weapons they desire, including fully automatic weapons, grenades, and rocket launchers. But despite having access to such powerful weaponry, they'll still be deterred from committing a crime by the possibility of confronting a victim who is carrying a concealed .38 snub-nose or sub-compact Glock.\"\n \n \n \nI see no evidence that this is reliable.

That's your example? Money given to the Eddie the Eagle Gun Safety program?\n \n The Eddie the Eagle Gun Safety program comes into your school and ONLY teaches kids what to do if they see a gun! The program does Just these four things. They do and teach absolutely NOTHING ELSE! Stop! Don't touch! Leave the area! Tell an adult! Sounds like the gun industry is contributing to do a good thing, but apparently not to the Anti-gun mind!\n Link    Experiment Tests Children's Knowledge of Gun Safety  \n ...... That's why children need to know what to do if they ever find one. We put some kids to the test. \n \n We put it in a chair. Two hidden .... \"I t's a gun, don't touch it, I know what is all about, do not touch it, its dangerous,\" screams little Natasha Fanning. .... But not one of them touches the gun. \n \n After watching the video of their children's reactions, the parents are relieved. .......Even if you don't own a gun, teach your children to steer clear of guns at friends' homes, or wherever they come across them. \n\n Here in my city, one of our local News stations tested all of the Child safety programs like Eddie the Eagle about 6 or 7 years ago and only the NRA's Eddie the Eagle produced the same 100% results like the experiment above. \n \n Here is something explaining Eddie the Eagle. \n   Today's Gun Accident Rates Lowest On Record \n And what a success the program has been. Thanks to NRA safety training, fewer children are involved in fatal firearm accidents today than did 90 years ago, and America's accidental firearm fatality rates have fallen steadily for decades. But now, with the help of Eddie Eagle, that safety record is improving faster than ever before. Studies from the National Center for Health Statistics indicate a 56% drop in fatal firearm accidents among children since 1988, the year that Eddie Eagle began. \n\n  Awards \n The National Sheriffs' Association formally endorsed the Eddie Eagle GunSafe\u00ae Program. (March 2002)\n \n A study published in the Journal of Emergency Nursing Online named Eddie Eagle the best of more than 80 gun safety programs evaluated. (October 2001) \n \n The American Legion passed a resolution encouraging its Posts and Departments to introduce Eddie Eagle to elementary schools and law enforcement agencies in their communities. (May 1995) \n \n The American Legion Child Welfare Foundation awarded a $25,000 grant to The Eddie Eagle Program. (October 1995) \n \n The Youth Activities Division of the National Safety Council awarded its silver Award of Merit to The Eddie Eagle Program for its efforts to \"promote safety and health, save lives, lessen injury and reduce economic loss.\" (October 1996) \n \n National Safety Council presented its Citation for Outstanding Community Service Award to program creator and NRA President Marion P. Hammer. (October 1993) \n \n The National School Public Relations Association presented its Golden Achievement Award to the program. (April 1994)\n \n Link   2000 Annual Meeting Transcripts  \nWithin the past five years the NRA Members have donated 20 MILLION dollars to teach gun safety to 13 million children through the Eddie the Eagle gun Safety program. \n \n \n The NRA membership says: It is our gift from we grateful Law-abiding citizens, to our fellow citizens of this Great Nation.\n \n They call Eddie the Eagle, Joe Camel with wings.\n \n   Eddie Eagle teaches students about gun safety  \n PIERCE TWP. -- Thanks to Officer Ed Dye and Eddie Eagle, primary students at three Pierce Township schools know what they should do if they ever find a gun.\n \n \"It's a simple message,\" he said, \"and they take it home and remember it.\" During the presentation, students watch a video about Eddie Eagle and learn his motto: \"Stop, don't touch, leave the area and tell an adult.\" After the video, there is an appearance by Eddie Eagle himself. \n",

   "Well if your position isn't that \"it's not necessary to have high capacity magazines because gun owners can reload quickly when defending themselves against criminals\" then logically your position must be that such high capacity magazines are necessary for self defense. But if such magazines would benefit law abiding citizens in an armed conflict then why couldn't they also benefit criminals? \n\n Maybe you could ban them from criminals! That should solve the problem! We all know how Criminals obey the law! \n \n England went down the road you wish to take us, but we still read this! \n   Weapons sell for just \u00a350 as suspects and victims grow ever younger \n Senior police officers have been warning for several months that a growing number of teenagers in big cities are becoming involved in gun crime. \n \n The age of victims and suspects has fallen over the past three years as the availability of firearms in some cities has risen. \n \n \"Illegal firearms have become increasingly accessible to younger offenders who appear more likely to use these firearms recklessly,\" a report on gun crime commissioned by the Home Office cautioned last year.\n\n \n   Shotguns for \u00a350: study reveals weapons culture  \n Sawn-off shotguns are still the weapon of choice for the more serious armed criminal and can now be bought illegally for between \u00a350 and \u00a3200, according to Home Office research. A purpose-built 9mm handgun, which is easier to conceal than a shotgun, is available for \u00a31,000-\u00a31,400 on the back streets of Britain while those wanting \"a gangster image\" can buy a  machine gun  for \u00a3800.\n\n So if taking guns away from civilians works to take guns from criminals, shouldn't there be less gun crime?
