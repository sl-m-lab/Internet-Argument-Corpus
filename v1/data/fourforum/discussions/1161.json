The Supreme court said the 1954 insertion of \"under God\" was made \"to recognize a Supreme Being\" and advance religion at a time \"when the government was publicly against atheistic communism\" -- a fact that the federal government did not dispute.\n The use of that little phrase is against the personal beliefs of some people. When children are \"forced\" to say the pledge (it is mandatory in the state where I live) in school those kids have a choice to honor their beliefs or to be subject to ridicule for not being \"part of the group\".",

This is actually new this school year! I was astounded by this. I think what it boils down to is that most politicians are terrified of seeming \"unpatriotic\" and pushed this law through with no resistance. The policy at the school my 8th grader attends (and all across Texas) is, that if a child has not been \"offically\" excused, and she/he does not say the pledge, parents are called in an effort to coerce the child into submitting to the \"rule\". I gave my 8th grader permission to keep respectfully quiet during the pledges, however I will not \"send a note\" to the school. If the school calls me complaining about this, they will just have to see me in court. emoticon_angry",

   "1) Charities are not socialism. If you were a libertarian, then you'd support charities based on the theory of subsidiarity. Libertarianism doesnt equal individualism. Certainly in a libertarian world people can freely choose to give their property to others, yes? Socialism involves compulsion, charities are not coercive.\n \n 2) First of all, being forced to say the pledge is clearly unconstitutional, and has been since 1943 (West Virginia v. Barnette). However, with respect to \"under God\" i dont think merely making the pledge voluntary solves the issue. I oppose having the words contained for three reasons\n a) Political Issues: Having \"under God\" in the pledge is an endorsement of religious belief (specifically, that of monotheism over atheism, agnostism, or polythism). Justice Sandra Day O'Conner in Lynch v. Donnelly points out the harms of such endorsement, saying \"Endorsement sends a message to nonadherants that they are outsiders, not favored members of the political community, and an accompanying message to adherants that they are insiders, favored members of the political community.\" The harms of removing a select group from the political process, either overtly or implicitly are too great to be risked. Having the pledge divides society into an \"us vs. them\" situation, where atheists are seen as outside social spheres and rejecting social norms. This harms the sense of community and the mistrust deprieves them the right to participate in the process.\n b) Psychological Coercion: The court has consistantly held that just because an action is voluntary doesn't mean it isn't coercive. In Lee v. Weissman, the court recognized as much by striking down non-mandatory prayers in Engel v. Vitale, Lee, and Santa Fe Ind. School Dist. v. Doe. The psychologically coercive effects of not wanting to be an outsider or face stigma (see above) puts people in an uncomfortable situation that in effect forces them to put their religious beliefs on display. In Lee, Justice Kennedy aptly labels this predictment \"participate or protest.\" There is no middle ground, and for more timid students the choice is hardly one at all.\n c) demeaning to religion: what religious supporters often forget is that the establishment clause is as intended to protect religion as it is to shield people from it. Justice Hugo Black noted in Engel v. Vitale that \"A union of government and religion tends to destroy government and degrade religion. The establishment clause thus stands as a testament from the founders that religion is too important, too sacred, too holy, to prevent its unhallowed perversion by a civil magistrate.\" Religion is something deeply personal, but by turning it into a one size fits all program, we strip religion of its individual essence and instead commoditize it. At the point where religion is removed from the individual sphere and becomes faith not by choice but by government mandate, it isn't faith at all. Religious people should support the removal of \"under god\" as an assertion that their religious beliefs are strong enough to not need a government crutch. Every moment that religion is supported by government is a moment where it is implicitly granted that religion NEEDS to be supported by government. As a religious person, I cannot accept that.",
