   "If Larry Craig was a Democrat, we'd be hearing a lot from liberals in the media about how he was bravely exploring his sexual identity. We would hear indignant objections to this policeman who, obviously having nothing better to do with his time, was doing surveillance in airport bathrooms in search of innocent people to harass and victimize. The ACLU would be right in there, asking about Craig's right to privacy and wondering why such ambiguous evidence (he placed his bag in front of the door, he tapped his foot) was enough to warrant arrest and prosecution. Even Craig's guilty plea would be employed in his favor: look, the man is at least being honest about what he did, and why should he be ashamed of being who he is? If Larry Craig was a Democrat, the system, not Craig, would be on trial.\n \n Unfortunately for Larry Craig, he is a Republican and a conservative to boot. We've been hearing a lot about conservative hypocrisy in the past several days: turning on CNN, I saw anchor Soledad O' Brien, correspondent Candy Crowley and legal pundit Jeff Toobin all having a great time with the subject. None of them saw fit to comment on the Himalayan hypocrisy of the liberals, undoubtedly because they embodied it.\n \n So where is the liberal hypocrisy? Consider: the cardinal values of today's liberalism are the right to personal freedom, the right of consenting adults to do what they want as long as they do not trespass on the rights of others, and the right to privacy. Larry Craig's conduct may have been unseemly, but he did not violate any of the liberal values. He wasn't assaulting the man in the other stall, he was approaching him to seek his consent. Whatever he was doing, he wasn't doing it in the Oval Office like Clinton but in a men's room stall. Notwithstanding the obscure \"signaling\" that was apparently going on, Craig didn't actually engage in any kind of sexual activity. No cigars were inserted into any private orifices. Craig's home, in contrast with Barney Frank's apartment, was not used as a full-service prostitution venue. Craig hasn't figured out, like Gerry Studds, that you don't have to forage in airport restrooms when there are pages to be turned over on Capitol Hill itself.\n \n In all those cases--Barney Frank, Gerry Studds, Bill Clinton--liberals rushed to the defense of their guys and proceeded to attack their critics as the real threat to civil liberties and social freedom. (Bill Clinton's approval ratings on the left actually rose when his sexual misconduct came to public light.) Therefore in the Larry Craig case, liberal indignation stands exposed as largely opportunistic. Here is a chance to hoist the conservatives on their own petard, to hang another scandal on the necks of the GOP, and to undermine the case for moral standards in society under the pretext of upholding them.\" - by Dinesh D'Souza\n http://news.aol.com/newsbloggers/2007/09/04/if-larry-craig-was-a-democrat/",

The reason that Democrats would not want this man in their ranks is not because he is or isn't gay. (There is no way to even prove whether or not he is or isn't gay--Craig himself emphatically say he isn't.) It's because he now carries political baggage than can be a liability.

They want nothing to do with this issue, or with Craig, which is why they've been pretty silent overall on the matter.\n\n \n Well, your whole scenario of \"what would the Democrats do with Craig\" is imaginary, as Craig is not a Democrat and he doesn't appear to want to become a Democrat. If Craig were a Democrat to begin with, he would have less reason to be closeted, since the Democrats don't try to appeal to a base that demands that gay people be repudiated and excluded. I'm not saying there are no closeted gay Democratic political leaders living double lives. Look at James McGreevey. However, that's beside the point, because Craig is a Republican and not a Democrat. Craig is a Republican probably because he believes in most of the values and positions of that party. And there is just about no place within the Republican Party for an aspiring politician who believes in most Republican values and positions and who happens to be gay, other than deep in the closet. The Democrats have at least opened the closet door a bit, and openly gay people do run as Democratic candidates with the blessing of party leaders. \n \n Politically it's smart for Democratic leaders to be silent about Larry Craig, to let the Republicans target each other over this. It certainly benefits the Democratic Party. Whether it's moral to be silent is another question. I think we as ordinary gay citizens and heterosexual citizens should speak out against the kind of police entrapment that Larry Craig endured, and we should speak out against the way Craig is being treated by leaders in his own party, with a few exceptions like Arlen Specter. I admire Arlen Specter for standing up for and with Craig on this.",

What we've been missing, though, is an on-the-record account from a source willing to come forward and tell what it's like to have an actual romantic liaison with the Idaho Republican. Meet David Phillips, a local IT geek and bear-about-town.\n \n Phillips was recently in a bar minding his own business when he heard Craig's voice on the television. \"I went pale and nearly vomited,\" Phillips says. It was the man he remembered from one of his creepiest sexual encounters twenty years earlier. \"After a truncated meal I went back to my hotel room and began unwinding and jotting down the memories that the voice had opened. I recalled The Follies, the furtive groping and pawing there, the odd following of this man in my car..... ####!\"\n http://wonkette.com/politics/larry-craig-scandal/exclusive-i-had-sex-with-larry-craig-314897.php",
