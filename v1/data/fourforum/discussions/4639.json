   "I'm surprised no ones written on this. When you walk into a school what do you see? Brick buildings, a mascott, trees, underwear, picknick tables......wait! Somethings wrong here....... Every time I walk around school every boy has his pants to his nees and shoes practically falling off. I've heard that this is an affiliation torward jails, not only gangs. The pants fall down because in a jail they take away your belt so not to hang yourself, and that goes the same to shoelaces,hence, the clonking shoes on the ground. Why hasn't anyone made a rule or something to stop this? Why asn't anyone interfeared yet?",

Like it or not the school can say just about whatever the heck they want when it comes to dress code. This doesn't relate to whether this is really inappropriate or not, but the fact is, the school can make and enforce the rules here. If they feel that something is detracting from the learning environment of the school, they have every right to stop it.\n I'm not saying that a school can just lay down arbitrary rules, but they aren't in these situations. I'm not some conservative whacko here.
