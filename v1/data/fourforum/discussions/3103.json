   "The Chechen separatists have more innocent blood on their hands. But who knows that they sided with the Nazis in WWII? Moslems and the Nazis have had a strong link.\n \n Bosnia's Muslims were recruited by the Nazis\n http://www.answering-islam.org/Walid/israel.htm#THENAZIISLAMCONNECTION\n \"The Nazis managed to recruit some Moslems directly. Several Moslem SS divisions were raised: the Skanderbeg Division from Albania, the Handschar Division from Bosnia, and smaller units from throughout the Moslem world from Chechnya to Uzbekistan were incorporated into the German armed forces in one capacity or another. This was only taking the first step in Heinrich Himmler?s planned grand alliance between Nazi Germany and the Islamic world. One of his closest aides, Obergruppenf\u00fchrer Gottlob Berger, boasted that\n \"a link is created between Islam and National-Socialism on an open, honest basis. It will be directed in terms of blood and race from the North, and in the ideological-spiritual sphere from the East.\"\n http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=4934\n \n And the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem planned (should the Nazis have won in North Afrrica) to hand the Jews of Palestine over to the Nazis.\n \"History shows Al Husseini to be a brutal man with aspirations to rule a pan-Arabic empire in the Middle East. He rose to prominence by actively eliminating those Jews and Arabs he considered a threat to his control of Jerusalem's Arab population, and he heavily utilized anti-Jewish propaganda to polarize the two communities\"\n http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/816232/posts\n \n The planned burning of bodies in specially made ovens was a Turkish method in their attacks on Armenians. It was a dialectic relationship, with many anti-Semetic practices adopted in turn by Moslems, from the Nazis\n \"Obviously, many of their actions as well as the rhetoric and the slogans used in this anti-Semitic campaign were clearly taken over from Nazi Germany. The Brotherhood, however, included Islamic roots of hatred against Jews as well\"\n http://pnews.org/art/10art/ROOT.shtml\n \n And the relationship continues today\n http://emperors-clothes.com/gilwhite/baker.htm\n and\n http://www.meforum.org/article/pipes/1431\n \n It is a natural alliance as both ideologies seek world domination. Both hate the Jews. Both employ ethnic cleansing.",

I said the site was. If you are going to re-word what I say, I will point it out.\n \n I am not Catholic and I know of many instances of Catholic persecution of my church, the Orthodox Church. It is irrelevant though to this debate. The links between Moslems and the Nazis exist, you can argue against this. That you can find other links between the Nazis and other groups seems to suggest that you're applying the two wrongs make a right argument. I had hoped one of the resident Moslems might argue against my statement, based on the facts I presented. Instead you enter the debate with grand and sweeping statements. However if you are interested in debate on reasoned grounds it would help if you give citations for your statements - as you did, but only after prompting.\n \n I can see that there are Catholics who helped the Nazis. Nazi Germany had a sizeable Catholic population and some predominantly Catholic nations; Croatia comes to mind, had very pro-Nazi leanings. I am aware particularly of this as they were the enemies of Serbia - my co-religionists. However the essence of your argument is \"Don't say anything about Islam, because a Christian Church had connections with the Nazis\" and you made this statement with no apparent desire to support this with facts (until prompted). This is in fact a sense that I get from most people I debate. No one can question Islam, it seems to have a special immunity. Most people I know, know of the Crusades, the Pope's apology to the Jews etc. But it seems only anti-Christian episodes of history are allowed to be re-run.\n \n Regardless of this the facts presented by me still remain unchallenged. Even you didn't argue against them; you started a new argument.\n \n You did ask though 'what was the point?'\n \n Islam is essentially a totalitarian faith. Inbuilt into it is intolerance of other religions; this is what I wish to state - hopefully to inspire a debate. That you can draw upon other people who are intolerant (and no doubt you or someone else will), will be another debate.\n \n I should have called this post \"How to Argue\".
