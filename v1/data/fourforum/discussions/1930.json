   "This is what I've always heard as to the collapse of the USSR:\n \n The Cold War was a war to gain military superiority, although both countries involved (the US and USSR) both knew that war would never happen.\n \n Communism was the biggest reason for the collapse of the USSR. Many political scientists and economists thought that state control of most industries would result in being able to produce things more efficiently at a lower cost. However, with no incentive to keep costs down, and no incentive to begin research, the USSR fell behind the capitalist West.\n \n The USSR collapsed when it did mainly because of the United States. The US continued to take the lead in weapons, with the USSR following us. Then, Reagan announced that the US was going to begin development of several new systems (such as the \"Star Wars\" satelite system). The US never had any real intentions of doing so, but we made the USSR think that we were serious, and they threw money and personel on development of similar systems. However, they were unable to finance these systems and provide for everything else at the same time.\n \n I believe what Close_slave_can said. It was mainly flaws in the communist sytem that led to the collapse of the USSR. However, they happened at the time that they did because of actions the US took.",

   "I agree with the whole economics point of view. What people usually use to describe that is \"guns vs. butter\" meaning that you cannot keep a strong military through high spending and expect to fully fund all of your domestic policies. However, I think the US is better at manipulating this concept than other countries, especially the now-defunct USSR. Somehow (usually by accumulating an amazingly high national debt) we are able to maintain a high level of technology while still funding welfare, school systems, social security, etc. The Soviets couldn't do this, and I think that their downfall also came from a string of bad wheat harvests. I'm not sure the exact reason for them, if it was just a bad harvest or if too many peasants were drafted into the military, but the Soviets had to start buying grain from us during the Nixon years.\n \n Once they saw that they were losing the \"butter\" side of the equation, it was only a matter of time before we showed them that they could not win the \"guns\" side either. That came with Reagan. When he unveiled his idea for a missile defense that would stop the Soviets' missiles, they saw that if, in a nuclear war, they could launch missiles at our country, the missiles would be destroyed before they reached their targets. By offering that same sheild to the Soviets, Ron created a world in which the offensive power of a nation was pointless, eliminating the programs that the USSR was pouring all of its \"guns\" money into.",

   "The fall of the Soviets was almost inevitable. Almost. The reason that communism failed is because capitalism was not only a better alternative, but it was also has a solid foundation and wasn't going anywhere without a fight. If this were not the case then the Soviets could have actually won the Cold War themselves by spreading communism around the globe and weakening the strength of capitalism. I remember hearing the phrase that communism can only survive when the whole world is communist. I think this is essentially true and is partially the reason that I would say the US did help win a battle here if only politically. The US was the main supporter of capitalism and the largest enemy of communism in the world. They did fight in Korea and Vietnam and put pressure on many European and other swing nations to go capitalist in order to preserve our capitalist society. Capitalism needs a strong following in order to survive just as communism does so it was essential to maintain a core group of strong capitalist nations as the US helped to do.\n \n I don't see where someone can say there was no wars during the Cold War. The Cold War didn't just involve the US and the USSR. It involved all capitalist, communist, and undecided nations. Wars were fought by the US and the USSR in order to push forward their goals and ideals. There is no doubt that if this same war played out 100 times the US would probably win 99 times because the likelihood of victory was very much in their favor but it was not without a fight that communism and the USSR failed. This is the reason I understand why some people say that the Cold War was in actuality WWIII and the US and her allies did defeat the communists.",

   "Nobody really expresses surprise that the Soviet system collapsed. What is puzzling is that it collapsed so quickly, in the space of two to five years, and that it collapsed when it did, in 1991, and not in 1933, 1953, or 2003. The fundamentally flawed nature of the Soviet system means that it had multiple weaknesses, any of which could have caused or contributed to its collapse. It is as if Hercule Poirot was given a case in which the victim had been poisoned, shot, bludgeoned, drowned, and frozen by different persons at different times. (Such was the unfortunate fate of Grigorii Rasputin, but in his case the various methods were serially applied by a known group of assassins.) \n \n Factors in the Soviet collapse include military, economic, and political dimensions, and can be grouped into long-term and proximate causes. In reality, despite the vituperation of some of their exchanges, Sovietologists do not substantially disagree about the factual record of what happened. The disagreement lies in the relative weight placed on them in explaining the Soviet collapse, particularly when it comes to the personal role of the top leadership. Historically, most empires collapse due to defeat in war, and the Soviet Union was no exception. Its troops were defeated on the ground in Afghanistan (withdrawing in 1989), but more seriously its military-industrial complex was defeated in the Cold War arms race. The Star Wars program, begun as a \"scam\" to bring the Soviets to the negotiating table, worked even better than expected, since Ronald Reagan sincerely believed it might work. The Soviet military knew that their economy could not afford to create a new generation of weapons, and opted for compromise-paving the way for arms reductions and, more importantly, eventual withdrawal from Eastern Europe. The fact that the military had already given up on winning the Cold War meant that they did not go to the mat to maintain the Soviet hold over the East that no longer had strategic value.\n \n Nobody denies that Star Wars gave the Soviet leaders a fright and helped tip the balance in favor of reform. The disagreement comes when one raises some counter-issues. For example: could Gorbachev's conservative rivals in the Politburo have negotiated military downsizing without triggering the Soviet collapse?\n \n On the economic front, the consensus has shifted since 1991. At first glance, most observers, noting the mounting shortages and runaway inflation of 1989*1991, are inclined to believe that economic inefficiency was the smoking gun that killed the Soviet system. Work by Vladimir Kontorovich and Michael Ellman, however, has shown that although the Soviet economy entered a period of flat growth in the early 1980s, there are no grounds for believing that the economy could not have stumbled on for many more years. They argue that it was the half-hearted reform program launched by Gorbachev after 1985 that disrupted the creaky functioning of the planned economy and triggered the dire economic conditions that led to the collapse. No one has come forward with any serious analysis to challenge the Kontorovich-Ellman view that the Soviet economy was still good for a few more decades (had Yuri Andropov's kidney not given out on him). \n \n Few scholars see social mobilization as a decisive cause in the Soviet collapse. In Russia there was no social revolution in 1991, on a par say with the revolutions of 1789 and 1917, or Iran in 1979. Mass mobilization was largely limited to Moscow and other major cities and was of short duration. The \"democratic movement\" did not produce a lasting political organization (such as Poland's Solidarity trade union). American scholars rushed to Russia after 1991 to find and document the rise of civil society, on the assumption that the emergence of grass-roots organizations had played a vital role in the collapse. They came back largely empty-handed, and the work they produced documents the frustrations and limitations of civil society in Russia. On the ideology front, glasnost and democratization revealed that the ideological underpinnings of Soviet socialism had eroded, such that a vocal democratic minority was able to win a foothold in the elections of 1989 and 1990 and propel the reformer Boris Yeltsin to the Russian presidency in June 1991. The strength of communist and nationalist candidates in post-1991 elections suggests that pro-Soviet values continue to hold sway in at least one-third of the population. The social divisions are usually explained in generational terms, with the young opting for perestroika and democracy and the old remaining nostalgic for the past. It is not clear, however, how much direct causal power one can attribute to this process of ideological erosion, since it began back in the 1960s or even the 1950s.\n\n a czech site \n \n There have been many theories of how this happened. The first of the two strongest theories is that the democratic reforms that were instituted in Gorbachev\u00c2's perestroika and glasnost policies opened the empire up to many western sources of information and ideals that brought about the end of the Soviet Union. The second theory, the one I believe the most responsible for the collapse of the Soviet Union, was the public and secret policies that the Reagan administration implemented against the Soviets that caused their economy to be shattered and forced the leadership to implement democratic reforms.\n\n source \n \nThe post-war encirclement of the former socialist bloc by imperialism, exemplified by the Cold War, meant that the USSR was forced to sustain a massive arms expenditure. \n \n By 1981-1985 the growth rate of the Soviet economy, obviously on a larger total economic base, was 3.3% compared with 11.2% in 1951-55. (Samary, 1988, P.13) In order to increase the level of consumer goods and spend money on arms the Soviets withdrew capital from long-term investment: in 1978/79 it was only 1%; in 1980 - 0.5%. Estimates on the amount of the Soviet budget allocated to military expenditure vary considerably from 11% of GNP in the 1976-80 10th year plan, (Shaw and Pryce, 1990, p.144), to CIA estimates of 15% of GNP. (Shaw and Pryce, 1990, p.89) \n \n If many ostensibly civilian projects, (e.g. space research), which have considerable military implications are included in the calculations then the percentage of the Soviet economy devoted to military spending of one kind or another may have been much higher. The low productivity of Soviet labour did not allow the Soviet Union to compete with the world economy on favourable terms. This low productivity, and this is where a profound connection between the internal and external life of the Soviet Union existed, could only have been boosted by the energy and initiative of the masses. Such an input was not forthcoming.\n \n This was fatal because the limits of the Soviet economy as regards growth via extensive surplus value had been reached, and a move to the intensive accumulation of surplus value was necessary. In the absence of relying on the masses the leadership of the USSR was forced to look to advanced technology as a short-term palliative. (Hence, the importance of Western attempts, led by the US, to prevent the export of advanced technologies to the Soviet Union.). This could have been partly offset by internal technological innovations but, as noted above, these tended to be stifled. \n\n a communist site",

   "I`m going to cut and paste a reply I made on this topic in a different forum. Here goes;\n \n I think there is some confusion between the fall of the soviet union and the end of the cold war. While both always where intertwined and ultimatly shared the same fate, I think it is wrong to not make a disticntion between them.\n \n The (victory of the) cold war was definatly something that could be atributed to the US and its allies. And it also argueably had important effects on the soviet union domestic politics (most noteworthy escalating military expenditures and trade embargos). But I would be hesitant to attribute the fall of the soviet union to the effects of the cold war.\n \n I would attribute the fall of the soviet union to the social movements in eastern europe and the Soviet reactions to them. And while Peter Rutland (the author of the first text supplied by Fracas ) is right when stating that Russia did not have any prominent social movements during this time, this does not mean that The Soviet Union and the member states of the warsaw pact didn`t.... Poland, the baltic republics, Tcheckoslovakia, Hungary and East Germany broke away from the Soviet Union through democratic revolutions that where made possible by the actions- and led by, the various social and democratic movements in eastern europe. And while it could be argued that The soviet union did not fall until Gorbatjov was disposed and the Soviet union was formally disbanded, I think its safe to say that the revolution is eastern europe made the union and its leader powerless and impopular which in turn was the number one reason why the Sovet Union collapsed \n \n The fate of Russia was a different story though. Lacking the same social movements, it instead became a game of power politics. Where state politicans where battling control with the federal politicians. When Jeltsin won the \"elections\" (still one party elections) for Chairman of the Russian Supreme Soviet, he began negotiating a new form of federal government with Gorbatjov, a government that would be much less centralized and the lion share of the political power would be placed in the state governments. This proved to be too much for the old communist guard who overthrew Gorbatjov with a coup. But now, even the Russian public reacted, crowds shouting for democracy gathering in thousands in Moscow and Leningrad (St: Petersburg). The coup only lasted three days before Gorbatjov was released, but this hadn`t stopped Jeltsin from strengthening the state government at the expense of the federal government. When Gorbatjov resumed his office, he found out that he had become \"a president without a country\" and he formaly resigned and turned over his powers to Jeltisin, christmas morning 1991.\n \n To summarise. The fall of the Soviet Union should IMO be attributed to the eastern european social movements and the Soviet reaction to those (doing nothing). I`m sure economics where an important reason for the implementation of Glasnost and Perestrojka. And I`m sure that the US and the Cold war played an important part in escalating the economic problems of the Soviet Union, I think it would be very pretentious and ethno-centric to claim credit for the fall of the Soviet Union. That would be a spit in the face of all those Poles, Tjecko-slovakians, East Germans, Russians, Hungarians, Balts, Ukrainians, Belarussians who risked their lives to make sure that their children would be born in free and democratic countries... \n \n Phew... That`s my explanation, and I`m sticking with it!\n \n Edit: Made a distinction between the soviet unon and the members of the warsaw pact.",
