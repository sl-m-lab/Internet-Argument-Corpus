   "[SIZE=7][SIZE=7]Not many people close to me know my story but for once I'm actually ready to share with other people. Maybe I can reach out and help somebody or help people see the reality. When I was 16 I was curious about sex because a couple of my friends had done it and I (for some dumb reason) wanted to see what it was like for myself (peer pressure, I guess). So it happens that my period doesn't come. I find out that during this most unpleasurable experience he decided to take the condom off. I knew I was pregnant. And I knew that my mom would kill me if she found out so I kept it to myself. After a few weeks my mom started to get bad feelings and confronted me, had me take a pregnancy test, and as I said was ready to kill me. She was ashamed and really didn't give me much of an option as to whether or not I wanted to keep the baby. I also knew deep down that I was not ready to have a baby nor did I have the financial means to take care of one (unless I wanted to live off of welfare). The father was not going to play an active role in this baby's life, as far as he was concerned this was all a big joke to him. So I went to the clinic ( passed through all the pro-life activists) and had the procedure done. I was scared but you know, I knew it was the right thing to do. I'm 27 now and still think back and ask myself if I have any regrets. I would have a child that would be around 11 years old. I wonder what kind if life the 2 of us would be living.

   "\n as a matter of fact I can. www.l4l.org\n \n\n Thank you for that reference, which says:\n \"Libertarians for Life was founded in 1976 to show why abortion is a wrong, not a right. Our reasoning is expressly scientific and philosophical rather than either pragmatic or religious, or merely political or emotional. Politically, of course, our perspective is libertarian. Libertarianism's basic principle is that, under justice, each of us has the obligation not to aggress against (violate the rights of) anyone else -- for any reason (personal, social, or political), however worthy.\n \n The Libertarian Case Against Abortion\n \n To explain and defend our case, LFL argues that:\n 1. Human offspring are human beings, persons from fertilization.\n \n 2. Abortion is homicide -- the killing of one person by another.\n \n 3. There is never a right to kill an innocent person. Prenatally, we are all innocent persons.\n \n 4. A prenatal child has the right to be in the mother's body. Parents have no right to evict their children from the crib or from the womb and let them die. Instead both parents, the father as well as the mother, owe them support and protection from harm.\n \n 5. No government, nor any individual, has a just power to legally depersonify any one of us, born or preborn.\n \n 6. The proper purpose of the law is to side with the innocent, not against them.\"\n \n Well said! :) \n \n Annie",

   "I disagree with your decision. It would have been better if you sucked it up and kept the kid. Even if you ended up on the street at least you wouldn't have killed anyone. I dont mean to be judgemental, and I'm not calling you a bad person, but what you did was wrong.\n\n \n Clearly you have never lived on the streets, and clearly you have never done any kind of study into the social ramifications of being homeless and/or living in constant poverty.\n \n Sure, not every kid that grows up impovrished is going to fall into a cycle of poverty, substance use, low self-esteem, and abuse (physical, emotional, sexual). A lot of them will. Too many of them will. \n \n It is naive and ignorant to tell someone that that kind of life is acceptable simply because they still have the \"privilege\" of existing.",
