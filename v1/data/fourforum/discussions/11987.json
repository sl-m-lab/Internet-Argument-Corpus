   "Yankee are continuing to kill civil Afghanis! Quite recently US soldiers killed 14 men who served armed guard in some private company, Americans said that they were looking like terrorists! Look, it's clear that Yankees are coward and shoot at anyone who moves! They shot the weddings even because they don't understand our traditions! I think that if thing keep going this way they could soon shoot boys just playing war game!\n The situation in Afghanistan could end by American soldiers punished one day by Afghanistan population due to lack of such on part of US command and Afghanistan officials who don't bother to investigate such accidents! More interesting is that 'error' shootings take place with American contingent mostly but not with their colleagues from the British or German contingents!",
