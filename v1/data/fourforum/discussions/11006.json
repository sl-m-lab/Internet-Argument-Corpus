   "Evidently I can't even challenge myself to prove my own claim of \"lying\" in the \"Liar's Corner\".\n \n So be it. On recommendation from admin, I put this under the \"Challenger's Corner\".\n ===================================================\n \n Lumping me in with posters who \"NEVER\" provide substantiation of their claims is a blatant lie.\n http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?p=303721#post303721\n \n I have repeatedly offered substantiation of my statements.\n \n A few examples:\n Opening post here:\n http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=10996\n \n Sprinkled throughout the thread here are repeated examples of posting evidence of my claim:\n http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=10724\n \n Another example:\n http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=10251\n \n And this thread involves a conversation between myself and steeeeve on the 9th amendment, in which I provided plenty of \"real data to back my claim\".\n http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=8299&highlight=steeeeve\n \n His assessment of me is blatantly false. On that, I see no real dispute.\n He has SEEN ME post substantiation of my claims before, on numerous occasions.\n I see only the inevitable conclusion of \"lying\", with the possible exception of some mental condition which caused him to \"forget\".\n \n \n Steeeeve, I challenge you to refute my assessment.",
