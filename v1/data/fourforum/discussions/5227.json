   "Let's play a game. This should hopefully clarify the other thread on information.\n \n Grab a dictionary. Make sure it is not one already being used. Look up the word \"information.\" Post the dictionary name and the definitions it provides. If your dictionary states the information MUST be non-material, not simply can or might, select \"non-material\" in the poll. Otherwise, select \"no.\" This way, we can see what the \"common-sense\" definition of information is.\n \n Ill start it off:\n \n Merriam-Webster.com:\n \n Information:\n 1 : the communication or reception of knowledge or intelligence\n 2 a (1) : knowledge obtained from investigation, study, or instruction (2) : INTELLIGENCE, NEWS (3) : FACTS, DATA b : the attribute inherent in and communicated by one of two or more alternative sequences or arrangements of something (as nucleotides in DNA or binary digits in a computer program) that produce specific effects c (1) : a signal or character (as in a communication system or computer) representing data (2) : something (as a message, experimental data, or a picture) which justifies change in a construct (as a plan or theory) that represents physical or mental experience or another construct d : a quantitative measure of the content of information; specifically : a numerical quantity that measures the uncertainty in the outcome of an experiment to be performed\n 3 : the act of informing against a person\n 4 : a formal accusation of a crime made by a prosecuting officer as distinguished from an indictment presented by a grand jury",

   "However, I do feel compelled to add the dictionary definitions are not what we are talking about. We are talking about a information theory, first developed and defined as part of communication theory, primarily at Bell Labs (now Lucent Technology). People like Peddler don't understand (and I believe are incapable of understanding) what the word means in that context. He has picked up a few buzz words but clearly doesn't know what he is talking about since he can't define information in a meaningful way. Peddler is limited to listing attributes that he feels are part of information and thinks that he has given a definition. He didn't eve recognize Shannon's definition of information when I gave it. And he further displays his ignorance by his inability to explain how a mutation followed by a reversal of that mutation can both reduce information.",

We investigated whether the perception of edge orientation, a fundamental visual feature, can be decoded from human brain activity measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Using statistical algorithms to classify brain states, we found that ensemble fMRI signals in early visual areas could reliably predict on individual trials which of eight stimulus orientations the subject was seeing. Moreover, when subjects had to attend to one of two overlapping orthogonal gratings, feature-based attention strongly biased ensemble activity toward the attended orientation. These results demonstrate that fMRI activity patterns in early visual areas, including primary visual cortex (V1), contain detailed orientation information that can reliably predict subjective perception. Our approach provides a framework for the readout of fine-tuned representations in the human brain and their subjective contents.\n\n \n http://www.psy.vanderbilt.edu/tonglab/decoding.html\n http://www.vanderbilt.edu/register/articles?id=19725\n \n \n\"Depending on what they focus their mental resources on, we can read out the content of their visual experience,\" Tong said. \"This is an important step toward eventually being able to read out the details of what a person is thinking by measuring their brain activity.

   "In re: log(base 2)\n \n Ralph V.L. Hartley was the first to use log(base 2) in relation to information in 1928 while working for Western Electric (later Bell Labs). Hartley was working on voice and carrier transmission and formulated the law of information transmission. Shannon continued the use of log(base 2) in his work formulation of information theory, also working at Bell Labs.\n \n Here's how it works. An information source is a stystem that outputs from a fixed set of M symbols. For purposes of discussion assume that each symbol in the set is equaly likely. The probability that symbol i will be produced is p(sub)i = P = 1/M. Any observer is uncertain which symbol is will be produced. The uncertainty is reduced once a given symbol is produced. The amount of information (I) obtained can be measured because the number of possible symbols is known.\n \n I = log(base 2)M\n \n The use of log(base 2) is a measurement of information in bits. Thus, if M= 16, then when any symbol is produced by the system uncertainty is reduced by 4 bits. Compare this to the ASCII code, the 128 character binary representation used in computer communication. If M = 128 then I = 7 bits. In fact, each of the ASCII symbols is represented by 7 bits.\n \n However, log(base 2)M = -log(base 2)1/M = -log(base 2)P\n \n Dembski calls -log(base 2)P a measure of complexity in an effort to define complex information. Dembski's problem is that the above equation has applications to both Classical Information Theory and Algorithmic Information Theory, and Dembski conflates the two.\n \n But peddler hasn't read Dembski. peddler failed to recognize the definition of information that I gave in another thread which is an extension of the above equation. peddler prefers Gitt, probably because Gitt operates in a similar manner to peddler. Gitt makes assertions with no evidence for any of them. Gitt defines 8 \"empirical principles\" and offers no data to back them up. He is essentially defining the conclusions he wants to reach. Similarly, Gitt offers 14 theorems and fails to demonstrate any of them beyond an apeal to his already asserted \"principles.\" Meaning is important to Gitt, yet he fails to define that. Essentially, Gitt's work on information theory is nothing more than assertion and handwaving. In neither Classical nor Algorithmic Informaion Theory is meaning defined - nor is it necessary.\n \n But it's easy to see why peddler prefers Gitt - peddler is also fond of handwaving and assertion without supporting any of it with evidence. However, I suspect that peddler didn't understand Gitt either. He sure has trouble understanding what he has been taught here.",
