This verse demonstrates three truths:\n a) The unborn's life is equivalent in value to an adult's life in God's sight\n b) This also outlines God's Law against criminal feticide.\n c) The killing of the unborn is murder \n\n I'd quite like to see the original translation of this, because that verse is one of the (many) more ambiguous ones in the bible. \n \n Firstly, the most literal translation I can find of the first half says this: \n \"22 And when men strive, and have smitten a pregnant woman, and her children have come out, and there is no mischief,\".\n The KJV has similar wording: \n \"22 If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow:\".\n Several further translations of this verse take this to mean 'gives birth prematurely', as you have, but several others (1, 2, 3, 4) all have variants on the theme of \"if a pregnant woman is hit so that she miscarries\". This drastically changes your implied meaning of the passage.\n \n Secondly (and related to the first point), the verses don't specify to whom they are applying - is it the baby who must be injured for 'an eye for an eye' to apply, or is it the mother? There are several things here which imply that it is the mother. \n 1. Several of the various translations refer specifically to the mother being injured - eg \n \"When there's a fight and in the fight a pregnant woman is hit so that she miscarries but is not otherwise hurt\"\n or \n \"Suppose a pregnant woman suffers a miscarriage as the result of an injury caused by someone who is fighting. If she isn't badly hurt, the one who injured her must pay whatever fine her husband demands and the judges approve. 23But if she is seriously injured, the payment will be life for life\". \n No translations that I could find referred specifically to the baby in this way.\n 2. Judging by the 'miscarriage' translations, it makes no sense to refer to the infant; it has already miscarried. The only alternative is that it refers to the woman.\n 3. The verse later specifically mentions 'tooth for tooth'. Seeing as a newborn baby (especially a premature one!) doesn't have any visible teeth, this makes no sense to apply it to the infant. Again, the only alternative is the woman.\n \n You have one interpretation. I have another. The two interpretation vastly change the implications of the passage.\n Your turn.",

See the difference? If the bible actually endorsed abortion, I would be the staunchest defender of it on this forum.\nThe problem here is that you have looked at the bible, decided that it supports the pro-life stance and are now searching for all the biblical evidence you can find which supports that conclusion. Your mind is now shut firmly to all other possibilities, regardless of how open it may once have been. Why else would you dismiss out of hand arguments which disagree with you, despite the fact that they are based directly on translations of the bible that are currently (presumably) in circulation? \n \n You need to show arguments to prove why your translations are the ones which should be used, and not mine. You must have had those arguments internally yourself at one point when you were deciding which stance to take - what convinced you at that point to go pro-life rather than pro-choice; to believe in the 'premature birth' translation rather than the 'miscarries' translation?\n \n Furthermore, I have less of an agenda that you are implying. I'm throwing problems at your arguments (or rather, at the website you linked to's arguments) not to prove my arguments on abortion, but to test how strong yours are. Personally, I don't consider the bible to be at all relevant as a guiding point for the start of 'life', wherever it may claim it to be - but I'm interested in finding out why you think it is, and forcing you to expound upon your initial arguments helps me to do so. Speaking honestly, I have always thought that the exodus verse was a prime example of the potential errors in translation that the bible can suffer from; I believe I've referenced it before (if not in this forum, then certainly in others).\n \n \nSEE ANSWER ABOVE\nThat's not really a response. The intentions behind an argument don't affect the validity of the argument itself - for example, 2+2=4, and just if I bet you that this is the case doesn't suddenly mean that my reasons why 2+2=4 are suddenly less true.\n \n To put it another way - let's pretend we were arguing about what colour your new iphone is. You (correctly, for the sake of the analogy) claim that it's mostly black, whereas I claim that it's mostly bright orange. It would be a silly argument for me to make that \"of course you'd say it's black, black is your favourite colour - your agenda is that it's black, so all your arguments that it's not orange are automatically invalid\". However, in this thread that's exactly what you've done. You've just said the equivalent of \"of course you'd say it supports abortion, you support abortion - your agenda is that it supports abortion, so all your arguments that it's not pro-life are automatically invalid\".\n \n Why are my arguments - for example, that the Exodus passage can and as been interpreted to say \"if a woman is caused to miscarry but is not further harmed, her attacker need only pay a fine\" - invalid? You have yet to answer this question.\n \n \nAnd no I don't say that life in the process of forming is not yet life. I say that once the egg and the seed are fertilized and it begins to grow, that is the most fundamental evidence of life we could possibly imagine.

That's pretty darn close.\n Forming life is not life. You have not presented any evidence that this is not the case - all you've done is re-enforce your first part, that it becomes life.\n \n \nBut when it comes to the life of human beings, you insist that the unborn think or breathe before admitting they are actually alive.

And you have never answered my repeated question of how this fertilized egg grows at all if it isn't actually alive.\n\n ...Uh, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't this the first time in this thread that you have asked this question?\n You're going the way of Chuz here, and assuming somehow that because a zygote is alive as a cell it means that it is alive as a person. However, a zygote is a living cell - but it isn't an alive person. The distinction is a key one - for example your skin cells are alive cells, but they aren't alive as 'people'; if you cut yourself you aren't arrested for multiple manslaughter, despite the fact that you are killing living human cells.\n The argument here is that at some point during pregnancy an alive foetus becomes an alive person. The emergence of the mind is a handy place to draw the line - personally, I'd go for that or for the point where the foetus can viably survive outside the womb, as the two are fairly closely linked.",

   "Obvious child, I think we've gathered enough info and opinions to conclusively answer your question. God doesn't endorse abortions. In fact, as a rule God commands against murder of all kinds. \n \n However, as Matt pointed out, the verses you use to bring forward your point can't really be compared to or considered as abortion. When you rip open the bellies of pregnant women, particularly in the violent way described in the scripture, you indeed kill the unborn baby, but you also kill the mother in the process. Even though God was commanding this fate upon the samarians, it doesn't imply that he is ok with his people killing the unborn baby and leaving the mother intact. Apples and oranges really. \n \n The bottom line is that God is against all forms of murder, killing and violence. This is an absolute and eternal truth, since it is written in the bible, which is the unfallible word of God. In addition, God loves us and only wants what's in our best interest. God is not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance. That's why we have so few examples of God unleashing his wrath on people, especially in the old testament. God is a merciful and gracious God, obviously. \n \n However, as steeeeve so clearly pointed out his teacher's rules analogy, God reserves the right override his absolute and eternal truths by doing the contrary, since he is the author of the rules. Since God is several levels above our human interpretation of absolute and unchangeable, he can change his mind about his absolute morality, make exceptions to his rules, and still be morally consistent. But bear in mind that this distinction only applies to God. Even though the teacher in our analogy was both illogical and hypocritical, that teacher isn't God, so she can't be inconsistent with her rules and consistent with her rules at the same time. Only God can pull that off. \n \n So, to answer your question: was God wrong when he commanded the israelites to perform abortions? (Abortions in this case included the peril of the mother as well.) The answer is no. \n \n And for future reference, whenever you're wondering what the answer is to a question hat begins with the phrase \"was God wrong...\" the answer is always no.

The employee has done two very different things: made a gift with the boss's knowledge and permission, and a gift without the boss's knowledge or permission. That difference explains why the second case is theft, but the first is not. No reason to find any hypocrisy on the part of the employee, just two different actions on two different occasions.\n \n Nor has the owner been hypocritical. He hasn't taken a rule and applied it differently to himself than to others. Now, if he routinely gives away sweatshirts to friends for any whim that strikes him, but never lets the employees do so even when they ask him if they may do so for a special occasion (like a birthday, say) -- that would be hypocrtical. It wouldn't be illegal, nor should it be. But it would be hypocritical. I wouldn't take such a person as a paragon of generosity.\n \n To return to the substantive point.

   "Is a pot or a building sentient? When you find me one that is, even before it is created, then your analogies will be half-valid.\n \n People, however, are sentient. And while I accept that (from your POV) you can't morally judge God, you should be able to look at Him for examples of good moral behaviour - at all times. That's what you have been arguing for half of the time anyway - that God is absolutely moral in everything that He does, which conflicts nicely with the other half of your argument that 'we can't judge if God is being immoral (or not)'. But I digress.\n \n Going by this line, murder is perfectly justified - if you believe that God commands it. So is deliberately killing innocents if they are part of a community which has been deemed by God as 'wicked'.\n \n Incidentally, I was intrigued by this notion. Would God punish the many for the acts of the few - or even for the acts of the majority? Clearly this is your fear, but on what basis does God seek to harm the innocent?\n \n \nThe difference between you and I is that you think what they and God did was wrong. That's ONE of the reasons why your thinking is so screwed up on the Bible.\nRight and wrong aside for a minute... how does the opinion of the person writing the words affect the meaning of the words themselves? Unker was quite right - what he said and what you said were remarkably identical, but you disagreed with his version. This implies either that you didn't read it properly, or that - somewhere - you're being inconsistent.\n \n Looking back at the 'right and wrong' issue - the morality of the Old Testament peoples (God included) is definitely questionable. Take Genesis 34 for example - Jacobs daughter is raped in the fields then her rapist (Shechem) falls in love with her and asks for her hand in marriage, so his father meets Jacob to propose a bonding between the tribes. Jacob agrees - on the condition that every man in Shechem's city be circumcised. The city agrees. Three days later \"while all of them were still in pain, two of Jacob's sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, took their swords and attacked the unsuspecting city, killing every male. 26 They put Hamor and his son Shechem to the sword and took Dinah from Shechem's house and left. 27 The sons of Jacob came upon the dead bodies and looted the city where [d] their sister had been defiled. 28 They seized their flocks and herds and donkeys and everything else of theirs in the city and out in the fields. 29 They carried off all their wealth and all their women and children, taking as plunder everything in the houses.\"\n \n Another example, concerning a prophet of God - Elisha. It kinda speaks for itself.\n \" 23 From there Elisha went up to Bethel. As he was walking along the road, some youths came out of the town and jeered at him. \"Go on up, you baldhead!\" they said. \"Go on up, you baldhead!\" 24 He turned around, looked at them and called down a curse on them in the name of the LORD. Then two bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the youths.\"",

The passage is speaking to the consequences to a man who's actions cause the death of an unborn child.\n\n \n It is in the first place unclear to whom the \"further harm\" is done. But even granting that the fetus dies, it is not clear how the situation is analogous to abortion, because the intentions of not only the man but even more importantly of the pregnant woman are completely different.\n \n \nAnd the proscribed consequence is death according to OT Law. So although the passage isn't speaking to abortion at all, it is making a very clear statement regarding the value of the unborn, as it is requiring a life for a life just as for any other sentient being according to the OT Law.\n\n \n But of course, the laws of the Old Testament neither are nor should be the laws of 21st-century America. We are a religiously pluralistic society, and our political laws need to reflect that. If you note my earlier comments today on Roe, I think the decision is brilliant on this score: the court did not step in and decide a metaphysical question (When does life begin?) that neither it nor any other branch of governnment is qualified to do.\n \n \nSo these arguments I get from the likes of you and Iangb which argue that until a child shows mental awareness, it isn't actually a person deserving of human rights is a bogus and shortsighted position according to the scriptural point of view.

And yet, we are to make our choices, without any reasoned explanation whatsoever to demonstrate that one choice is \"really\" the one more likely to win the reward and avoid the punishment. Which leaves us in rather a pickle.\n \n Of course, strictly speaking, this isn't quite how it works, since -- as any good Augustinian or Lutheran or Calvinist can tell you -- nothing you do, no matter how good, can compel God to reward you, nor can anything you do, no matter how bad, compel God to punish you. God makes his choices about whom to reward and whom to punish, and we cannot influence his will.\n \n Which, as I see it, throws two strikes at traditional notions of the afterlife. We are in the dark, forced to make arbitrary choices on the basis of a faith that is, under that circumstance, truly blind -- and that wouldn't have any impact on the outcomes anyway, despite what pop theology says. Worse, God is rendered completely arbitrary as well, choosing the saved and the damned for allegedly inscrutable \"reasons,\" which we therefore have no reason (!) to describe as \"reasons\" at all.

I merely request that if we conceive of God as a supreme being we recognize that for him to act in such authoritarian ways -- \"I owe you nothing! Do what I tell you!\" -- is a mockery of his supremacy. Theologians have recognized this since the days of the Church Fathers, which is why they ever bothered to attempt rational explanations of theistic metaphysical and moral concepts in the first place.\n \n \nI'm not arguing this point.

Maybe reading it in context will help you understand the arguments being made. Bible and abortion : The Biblical case against abortion\n \n \nBut of course, the laws of the Old Testament neither are nor should be the laws of 21st-century America. We are a religiously pluralistic society, and our political laws need to reflect that. If you note my earlier comments today on Roe, I think the decision is brilliant on this score: the court did not step in and decide a metaphysical question (When does life begin?) that neither it nor any other branch of governnment is qualified to do.\n\n \n Here's the rub Matthew, I only made the statement to show the moral standing of Gods position. It is constantly argued by your side that God had no special concern for the unborn. This verse shows that God does value the life of the unborn according to OT Law just as He valued the life of any sentient being.\n \n If you, as a declared christian as you claim to be care about living up to Gods moral standards and principles, then how can you say that our 21st century laws shouldn't reflect Gods values since He clearly says throughout His word that He is the same yesterday, today and forever. In other words, if God valued the unborn 4,000 years ago, do you actually believe He values them any less today? \n \n Of course He doesn't. So how can you defend abortion on demand when it is snuffing out the life of an innocent healthy child which has done absolutely nothing to deserve the death penalty before he has even had a chance to live? It makes no sense for someone who claims to have a consistent spiritual perspective on life. \n \n \nActually, there is a great deal in question, even in the passage at issue. It continues to amaze me how little you distinguish \"the scriptural point of view\" from your view of scripture.\n\n \n I don't understand your confusion at all.

   "\n \n Looking back at the 'right and wrong' issue - the morality of the Old Testament peoples (God included) is definitely questionable. Take Genesis 34 for example - Jacobs daughter is raped in the fields then her rapist (Shechem) falls in love with her and asks for her hand in marriage, so his father meets Jacob to propose a bonding between the tribes. Jacob agrees - on the condition that every man in Shechem's city be circumcised. The city agrees. Three days later \"while all of them were still in pain, two of Jacob's sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, took their swords and attacked the unsuspecting city, killing every male. 26 They put Hamor and his son Shechem to the sword and took Dinah from Shechem's house and left. 27 The sons of Jacob came upon the dead bodies and looted the city where [d] their sister had been defiled. 28 They seized their flocks and herds and donkeys and everything else of theirs in the city and out in the fields. 29 They carried off all their wealth and all their women and children, taking as plunder everything in the houses.\"\n \n Another example, concerning a prophet of God - Elisha.

So of what value is your statement that the situation isn't analogous to abortion?\n\n \n My first point was that it's not clear whether harm to the mother or to the prematurely delivered fetus is what's at issue. The text is ambiguous.\n \n But my larger point is that the statement is not nearly as general as you're making it out to be. It is, in fact, a specific legal recommendation about what to do in a very specific situation of wrongdoing, similar to what we might describe as involuntary manslaughter of a fetus.\n \n I have no doubt that a more general moral principle of value for prenatal life animates this specific law. But what you're trying to do is take the specific punishment recommended here and then apply it back to anything that falls within the scope of that general principle. And that's what I object to.\n \n Suppose that theft of an automobile is punishable by ten years in prison. Suppose that we say the general principle animating this law is respect for private property. It would be absurd to infer from this that other forms of disrespect for private property --stealing a t-shirt or embezzling a million dollars or even perpetrating an arson -- should also receive the same punishment. Cases could clearly be made for different punishments, despite the same animating principle.\n \n Meanwhile, my point about the irrelevance of the passage to abortion still stands. Even the Bible does not place an absolute prohibition on killing: we are commanded not to murder, and per the Bible, not all instances of killing are ipso facto \"murder.\" The question then becomes, when is killing murder? The passage certainly indicates that when two people fighting cause the death of a pregnant woman or her unborn child (like I said, ambiguity), the penalty would be death according to Old Testament law: it is essentially murder. But since the passage in question does not refer to abortion at all, the passage does not establish that abortion is murder. That is what I've been getting at.\n \n \nHere is the link I posted earlier in this debate which has been largely ignored thus far. Maybe reading it in context will help you understand the arguments being made.\n\n \n For what it's worth, the Exodus passage simply does not establish the author's entirely overgenal point \"c) The killing of the unborn is murder.\" Even assuming that the \"serious harm\" or \"further harm\" in the passage refers to the fetus rather than or in addition to the mother (there's that ambiguity again), all that the passage shows is that this sort of killing of the unborn is murder. But since that sort of killing of the unborn is, as you yourself have acknowledged more than once, not an abortion, it does not establish that abortion is murder. He is making the same mistake you do, as I described above.\n \n The rest of the passages are likewise irrelevant. Just to take the next couple sets, the passages about God creating us in the womb merely establish that the general principle, not anything specific. And the passages about life beginning at conception are flimsy inferences at best. Read that full Psalm or that portion of the story in Judges and tell me that what we're supposed to take away from either is that life begins at conception. Preposterous.\n \n This is what I hate about so-called fundamentalist \"systematic theology,\" a la Grudem: it starts with a concept, and then looks for a passage to support it, no matter how ridiculous it is to lift that passage from its context.\n \n \nI only made the statement to show the moral standing of Gods position. It is constantly argued by your side that God had no special concern for the unborn.\n\n \n I have claimed more than once on this thread that God does care about prenatal life. So this point in your argument is simply not relevant to me.\n \n \nIf you, as a declared christian as you claim to be care about living up to Gods moral standards and principles, then how can you say that our 21st century laws shouldn't reflect Gods values since He clearly says throughout His word that He is the same yesterday, today and forever.\n\n \n Love the \"as you claim to be!\" Still think I'm not really a Christian, because I disagree with you, eh?\n \n Anyway, the reason why I don't think our civil laws should coincide with my religious views is that not everybody thinks about religion as I do. There are Jews and Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists, atheists and agnostics -- even other Christians who don't interpret scripture the way I do, like you. I have no right to force them to do things as I would.\n \n I do my best to live my life according to Christian principles. I encourage others to do the same by example (and some of the principles are generalizable beyond Christianity, of course). Sometimes I even invite a non-religious friend to worship, and sometimes they take me up on the offer.\n \n But what I will not do is use the force of government to impose Christian principles on those who are not Christians. At best, this would compel nothing more than outward behavior, not a change of heart. At worst, it displays more will to control than to love.\n \n \n In other words, if God valued the unborn 4,000 years ago, do you actually believe He values them any less today?\n \n Of course He doesn't.\n\n \n No doubt true. But as the passage doesn't state what God thinks about abortion, it's not relevant to the specific point at hand.\n \n Once again, you are confusing the general point (God cares for all prenatal life) with a specific point (abortion is murder).\n \n \nSo how can you defend abortion on demand--\n\n \n Now you're just pretending I said something I didn't say. I did not defend abortion on demand. Nor will I.\n \n Nor, as far as I can tell, will anyone. I think that \"abortion on demand\" is a phrase without a referent. No pregnant decides to abort her pregnancy lightly, nor should she. Treating the situation as if women get abortions like they buy a cup of coffee or go for a jog is a ridiculous distortion.\n \n In any event, to reiterate, I do not support abortion on demand. For what it's worth, I also oppose late-term abortions. Although... If a woman finds out in the third trimester that her baby has a lethal birth defect, then I don't think she should be compelled to carry her pregnancy to term.\n \n I would generally counsel against abortion even in earlier terms, except in cases where the baby will never survive (e.g. anencephaly), the mother's life is in danger, or where her long-term health will be jeopardized. Barring such circumstances, I don't think abortion is a moral way to go.\n \n But the fact is, just because I think something is immoral, that doesn't mean it should be illegal for everyone. I would counsel against abortion, but I would not legally prohibit it -- not until the third trimester, and with a reasonable exception made for the safety of the mother.\n \n On the other hand, I also support improved adoption practices; improved prenatal care; improved sex education; and childcare assistance for poor, unwed, or teenaged mothers. It shouldn't always be illegal to abort, but we should do everything we can to make the decision not to abort more manageable. That's pretty consistent with my moral view, I think.\n \n \n...when it is snuffing out the life of an innocent healthy child which has done absolutely nothing to deserve the death penalty before he has even had a chance to live?\n\n \n And of course, the question is, Is it \"snuffing out a life?\" You might think so, even I might think so, and we might cite our religious views in support of this -- but this is ultimately a metaphysical question. It is a matter of conscience about which none of us can be absolutely certain.\n \n Which is probably why even the official views change over time. In the middle ages, believers who were far more theologically conservative than most theological conservatives today believed that abortion prior to quickening was acceptable -- 40 days for a male fetus, 80 for a female. The Catholic Church adopted its present position in the early 20th century.\n \n Edit: I'd be very interested in knowing what were the ancient Jewish practices concerning abortion. I haven't been able to find much.\n \n \nIt makes no sense for someone who claims to have a consistent spiritual perspective on life.\n\n \n Sure it does. If you make a distinction between your own religiously based moral principles and governmentally enforced laws that will apply to everyone, whether they share your views or not. And if you recognize that it's possible for you to be mistaken about those very principles.\n \n It's called humility. And it's quite consistent with an active spiritual life.\n \n \nI don't understand your confusion at all. How am I to distinguish the scriptural point of view from my view of scripture?\n\n \n By acknowledging that your view of scripture could be wrong, and someone else's could be right. Again, humility.\n \n You believe that the scriptures prohibit abortion. But you could be wrong about that. I certainly think you are. But I could be wrong about that: maybe they do prohibit abortion, and you're right after all.\n \n What we need to do is look at what the scriptures say, and try to understand them. And we should acknowledge from the outset that we might still disagree even after that examination, that neither of us has a direct hotline into the mind of God, and we should proceed accordingly.\n \n \n \nThat statement sounds redundant to me, as if you're saying the same thing 2 different ways. So please clarify what you mean by this statement if you can.\n\n \n It's like the difference between saying \"God exists\" and \"I believe that God exists.\" One of them incorporates the subjectivity of the agent making the statement into the statement itself.\n \n When you understand this point, then you will finally understand my religious outlook, Archie!",

Authoritarianism was.\n \n Frankly, whenever I hear someone demand adherence to one of God's laws, even though the demander himself can't explain it, the voice I hear is authoritarian -- and it belongs to the person demanding, not to God.\n \n \nand my point is that there is no contradiction if God doesn't want to follow rules He creates for others.\n\n \n Nope, no contradiction. Just hypocrisy.\n \n I refuse to accept that God creates a lawful universe and then violates those laws whenever he sees fit. It seems to run directly counter to his power, his foresight, and his goodness.\n \n Of course, I also don't regard Biblical narratives as literally true. When I see a passage that depicts God doing or advocating horribly immoral things, I tend to see that as an all-too-human moment. Hence I don't try to explain away the alleged immorality as really being moral since God can do whatever he wants. Instead, I try to use a bit of discernment to see what spiritual insights the text reveals in spite of the human failings that are also expressed. A story for another time perhaps.",

   "That's not true. Israel as a whole was under God's protection, weren't they? But when they screwed up, one judgment after another befell them. Just read the book of Judges and the remainder of the OT to see that.\nUh, kinda. From the very next chapter after Jacob's boys did their pillaging: \" 9 After Jacob returned from Paddan Aram, [c] God appeared to him again and blessed him. 10 God said to him, \"Your name is Jacob, [d] but you will no longer be called Jacob; your name will be Israel. [e] \" So he named him Israel.\n \n 11 And God said to him, \"I am God Almighty [f] ; be fruitful and increase in number. A nation and a community of nations will come from you, and kings will come from your body. 12 The land I gave to Abraham and Isaac I also give to you, and I will give this land to your descendants after you.\"\"\n \n Things, as you say, changed later on as the tribe went their separate ways.

I was rather hoping that you would argue against it because you didn't believe it - and both wanted and was able to try and convince others that they shouldn't believe it either. However, if you are unwilling and/or unable to show that God is entirely moral in His behaviour, that's your call to make.\n \n Just to clarify here, my question is - how was God:[*]Turning Lot's wife into a pillar of salt [*]Causing bears to kill ('maim') 42 youths[*]Commanding His people to kill pregnant women and children[*]Protecting His people from the repercussions of deviously attacking and plundering a village[*]Sending the Angel of Death to kill the firstborn in every house in Egypt (new one, although I think I've mentioned it before in this thread)not examples of God acting immorally?\n \n In-post edit: Come to that, if you are going to deny that God has murdered etc at all (even where a case could be half-made that it was justified), what about Sodom, Gommorah, the Flood and countless others? You may call them justified atrocities, but they were atrocities, none the less.\n \n \nYou assume morality exists and God follows it but ultimately this means you feel God show follow what you say morality is. I'm of a different opinion.\nI think if you assume both that morality exists and that God follows it, the question then becomes - looking at the Old Testament, what examples from God can we take as good moral examples? The answer to that question clashes horribly with or perceived notions of today's morality - so either we must be wrong, God must be wrong, God is a moral relativist as civilisation changes (or, indeed, on a 'human morality vs Gods morality' level) or the Old Testament is not an accurate portrayal of God.\n \n Personally, I'd prefer a mixture of the last two of those options (as the Christian side of my agnosticism). There's an excellent Pratchett quote: \"The New Testament is basically about what happened when God found religion\".\n \n \nsaiah 55:8-9 (New International Version)\n \n 8 \"For my thoughts are not your thoughts,\n neither are your ways my ways,\"\n declares the LORD.\n \n 9 \"As the heavens are higher than the earth,\n so are my ways higher than your ways\n and my thoughts than your thoughts. \n\n True - however, the preceding verses adds a little context.\n \n 6 Seek the LORD while he may be found;\n call on him while he is near.\n \n 7 Let the wicked forsake his way\n and the evil man his thoughts.\n Let him turn to the LORD, and he will have mercy on him,\n and to our God, for he will freely pardon.\n \n Here is God saying that he will be kind to those who turn to him even if they are wicked people, because He is not wicked.

My point based on this was that, using the Old Testament to gain a viewpoint of God's morality (by assuming that everything God does is moral), you get a massive disconnect between 'Gods morality' (that is, everything God considers to be moral) and 'my morality' (everything that I and most of the population consider to be moral). For example, God orders the killing of pregnant woman and children, and protects mass murderers from the repercussions of their actions, both of which are highly counter to 'morality' as most people today would describe it.\n \n This results in one of the conclusions as listed in my previous post. From the looks of the rest of your post, it looks like you've gone with what I put as 'we must be wrong' - that is, man's current moral standards are incorrect. However, this has repercussions...\n \n \nIf all men have sinned and fallen short of the Glory of God, and if the wages of sin is death, as the Bible says, then no more need be said.\n \n Recommend you read Deuteronomy chapter 28 (The blessings of obedience and the curses of disobedience) to get a feel for God's sense of accountability.\nThis implies that every single non-Christian who dies by whatever circumstances 'had it coming to them'. It rationalises, excuses and practically encourages suicide bombers, jihads, lynch mobs, sites like God Hates The World (looks like Fred Phelps has set his targets a little higher...) and vigilante killings against people like George Tiller - heck, vigilante killings against all non-Christians. After all, God did it - why shouldn't you be just as moral as Him?\n \n If you start to think that it is moral to kill people on Gods orders, or that people deserve death for such arbitrary reasons as mocking prophets or living in a 'sinful' country... you're starting to sound remarkably like the more violent sort of Muslim fundamentalist. \n \n I read the Deuteronomy. There were a lot of unfulfilled threats in there, considering the number of people who have broken the rules - they are set up in the previous chapter, and include \"Cursed is the man who moves his neighbor's boundary stone\", \"Cursed is the man who carves an image or casts an idol-a thing detestable to the LORD, the work of the craftsman's hands-and sets it up in secret\" and \"Cursed is the man who dishonors his father or his mother.\" \n \n The other issue with this stance is also probably the reason why the Deuteronomy curse is less present today (assuming it was real in the first place, that is). God's behaviour in the Old Testament is immoral by 'todays standards', but it is also almost directly contradicted by Jesus. No more 'eye for an eye', but more 'turn the other cheek'. No more 'live by the sword', but more 'love thy neighbour'. Forgiveness and reconciliation became the main theme - understandably, given the bigger picture - hence my quote above, \"the New Testament is basically about what happened when god found religion\".\n \n If you're looking for a God to emulate, I'd pick Jesus over his more vengeful father. However, this returns us to the problem of opposing moral values - do you forgive the sinner, or attack him with bears; and how can the bible be consistent with both?\n \n \nOne other thing. It's not necessarily what you agree with that's going to determine your eternal place of abode. If this Biblical God is real, then you have to pick heaven or hell, Jesus or political correctness; life or death. That's reality. Don't blow it.\nIndeed. However - it still isn't clear, once you do believe, of what the morals you should live your life actually are.\n \n Re-reading this looks like I've rambled a fair amount. Oh well. I hope I've said what I meant to say.",

According to the author of Matthew, who was not an eyewitness to the life of Jesus, who wrote these words approximately fift years after Jesus' death, and who seems to have had liturgical purposes in mind as the Christian movement began to break away from Judaism and sought non-Jewish ways of understanding and expressing traditional Jewish ideas.\n \n \nAs I stated earlier about your use of words and your ability to argue, I don't have the time nor the patience the play word games or play with symatics.\n\n \n Who's playing word games or semantics?

I suppose it's because Jesus made no bones about taking names and pointing fingers.\n\n \n Tell me, why is it then that the disdain is against interpretations like Archie's? Why it is against views that make God look incredibly evil? Why is it always in the context of someone else's interpretation? \n \n Furthermore, you ignore how we bash Muslims as well. \n \n Just because we reject your interpretation doesn't mean that we hate Christanity. Or you're a dishonest POS who thinks only your interpretation is correct.",

   "Sure you are.\n\n \n Gee, thanks!\n \n \nSure you do.\n\n \n On this board? Absolutely. Off it? Well, I'm curious as to how you know.\n \n \nThat's weird, since I follow Jesus and His word --\n\n \n Your loveless and contemptful treatment of those with whom you disagree on this board renders that an open question, as I see it.\n \n (Have my \"rebukes\" convinced you yet? Aren't they effective?)\n \n \n-- I find myself disagreeing with secular humanists on every major issue discussed. Isn't it strange that you agree with them on all of the important issues? I guess you're just an open minded and tolerant believer, huh!\n\n \n I don't agree with them on all the important issues. Perhaps most obviously, on the issue of whether God exists or not, I disagree with every atheist on these boards. I just don't feel like arguing the point with them here.\n \n On the other hand, when I consider the political activity of the Christian right -- economically, socially, militarily -- I worry that there's a fair amount of \"practical atheism\" at work in the contemporary church. So for what it's worth, feel free to construe what I'm doing on this very board as fighting atheism after all.\n \n \nHow consistent of you Matthew, you consider our standing up for and defending the literal and traditional values which the bible espouses to be harmful to our society.\n\n \n Which values are those, exactly? Because I will defend Christian love with my life.\n \n \nThat fits right in line with your defense of all of the secular humanist principles you defend around here as you claim to be a believer.\n\n \n Most of those principles are far broader than \"secular humanism\" and can in fact be found at work in all the world's major religions. So I really don't have a problem defending them at all.\n \n On the other hand, a great deal that is narrow and chauvinistic can also be found in all the world's major religions, as well. And I think those of us who are religious would do a lot more for religion if we devoted ourselves to cleaning up those stains instead of hopelessly trying to explain why they aren't stains in the first place, let alone elevating those stains into sacred principles.\n \n \nI know you are Matt. That's exactly what I said above. You may claim to be a believer but you DO in fact defend exactly what you believe which is a complete and total secular humanist world view.\n\n \n Please. I'm a theist. I'm just not a theocrat, as you seem to think a \"true\" Christian must be.\n \n \nThat's why I said you defend the exact opposite of what you claim to believe. Get it now? I'm calling you a hypocrite.\n\n \n Oh, yeah. I've got it. emoticon_xgood\n \n \nOh I've got you figured out, and apparently Steamroller pegged you for the hypocrite you are in short order also.\n\n \n No, you don't. Nor does he. In fact, I would say your misunderstanding of me is near total. Sadly, you don't seem even slightly interested in correcting it, preferring instead to declare me a hypocrite so you don't have to take me seriously.\n \n In the perfect prison, the prisoner thinks he's free.\n \n \nYou can't claim to love the Lord and then reject Him at every turn when dealing with true believers...\n\n \n Where does it come from, this need to think of oneself as a \"true believer?\" I think it's all part of the same primordial tribal psychology that leads this or that group to think of itself as \"chosen by God\" or \"favored by the Gods.\"\n \n Not every culture has had a religion like this, of course. But I don't think it's a coincidence that no culture has ever had a religion in which some other culture ranks higher in the celestial hierarchy than their own.\n \n \n...and expect to con us, it just doesn't work that way Matthew.\n\n \n No con involved, Arch. I have never been anything but honest on this forum. And your only reason for thinking otherwise is that I don't agree with your view of religion, whereas obviously any \"true\" believer would.",

I gave you numerous examples and none of which are hypocritical.\n \n I can give others...For example, do you have to follow the same rules you give to your dog? \n \n \nI'm just saying that God should at least follow its own word. \nNo, you are implying you are above God.",
