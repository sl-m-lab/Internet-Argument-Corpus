To make the most out of the life we have now. If you want to waste your life searching for a purpose that is your choice. I've got better things to do.\n \n BTW, Christianity teaches that the purpose to life is to give praise to god. Anything which gets in the way of this is considered to be evil, or sin. Sounds like an empty life to me and also like the hell Christians believe in.",

I would like an answer, besides religion.\n \n Thanks,\n \n Ninjita con Ganjita\n\n \n Well, I'm not an atheist, technically, but I will try to keep my beliefs out of this.\n I definitely don't think that all of us share the same purpose, some universal goal. \n Sometimes I think maybe the point is to have questions like this. It sure does make your day a lot more interesting to have something kinda deep to ponder.\n Why do we continue living? Yeah, mostly instinct. (that- and these darn involuntary reflexes, like breathing.)\n Is there more? Well, that is something each person has to figure out for themselves. Some might think that their purpose is political, others religious, others medical... some might think there is nothing else, that when we die, we die and \"that's all she wrote\"\n \n It is my opinion that the highest goal one can aspire to is understanding the nature of the universe. Not just some simplistic idea about the creation of it, but the whys and wherefores of everything the universe contains. Not only being able to categorize form and function, but to figure out whys and wherefores. \n \n This is why I think that philosophers have made the greatest contributions to society. While I have a great respect for the strides people have made in medicine and politics etc... It is philosophy that explains to me whether any of that matters.",

If we don't and our possessions are taken away and we eventually end up on the street, isn't that just as acceptable a life as leading one full of cars, money, and family?\n\n \n We are led to believe such things as possessions and family are important by pretty basic needs. Fulfilling those needs creates happiness which is the ultimate goal and therefore fulfilling those needs are our purpose. Of course in the long run it is all meaningless but nothing in the long run matters. I think you could even debate that if there is a God he really has no purpose either.

That would explain the disillusioned people that search for money, thinking it will bring them happiness.\n\n \n Of course the ultimate purpose is to find happiness and of course money is not happiness although it does fulfill the security and luxury needs rather well and in turn raises the bar on what is necessary to make you happy.\n \n \nI guess our happiness is completely relative and its meaningless to mostly everyone but ourselves. We will be forgotten in 100 years (a fraction of a millimeter on the evolutionary timeline) along with our happiness and the few people it touched, so I ask again...purpose?\n\n \n I ask only that you tell me of one thing that does have purpose. Even God doesn't really serve any good and meaningful purpose. He is the creator of a pointless system that is ultimately there to bring him happiness which is of course of no concern to anyone but him.
