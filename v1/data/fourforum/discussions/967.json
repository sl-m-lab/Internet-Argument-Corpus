   "In light of the thread 'Evolution - A great theory' I decided to write something on Christianity. There are many readers here who are not Christian. Are you aware that the basis of modern western laws and morality is based on Christian principles?\n \n Why should we be moral?\n \n \"I cannot fancy to myself what the law of nature means, but the law of God. How should I know I ought not to steal, I ought not to commit adultery, unless somebody told me, or why are these things against nature? Surely, 'tis because I have been told so. 'Tis not because I think I ought not to do them, nor where you think I ought not. If so, our minds might change. Whence then comes the restraint? From a higher power. Nothing else can bind. I cannot bind myself, for I may untie myself again; nor an equal cannot bind me: we may untie one another. It must be a superior, even God Almighty. If two of us make a bargain, why should either of us stand to it? What need you care what you say, or what need I care what I say? Certainly because there is something above me, tells me fides est sevanda [contracts are to be kept]. And if we after alter our minds and make a new bargain, there's fides sevanda there too.\"\n John Seldon in \"Table Talk\" (c.1689)\n \n Writing a little more than a century earlier, Michel de Montaigne (1533-1592) said \"It is not perhaps without good reason that we attribute to simple-mindedness a readiness to believe anything and to ignorance the readiness to be convinced, for I think I was once taught hat a belief is like an impression stamped on our soul: the softer and less resisting the soul, the easier it is to print anything on it...On the other hand there is a silly arrogance in continuing to disdain something and to condemn it as false just because it seems unlikely to us. That is a common vice among those who think their capacities are above the ordinary\". \n \"That it is madness to judge the true and the false from our own capacities\", Michel de Montaigne (1993), \"The Essays: A Selection\", Penguin Classics, p74.\n \n Christianity gives a basis for morality that is not arbitrary; that is it is not based on fads and the whims of people (though they of course interact by acting as interpreters of divine wishes).\n \n The ideals founded in Christianity, that all men are of God, and therefore are equal is an idea that is the basis of modern democracy. The 'rule of law' rather than the arbitrary rule of a strong man, is also part of this legacy... that of authority above the individual.\n \n If we apply 'evolution' to these ideals, we get the materialistic break-down of the modern era.",
