   "The Qu'ran suggests that its followers wear attire that is modest in nature. In fact, there are laws established by Islamic countries to ensure that this suggestion is followed closely. However, nothing in Islam makes this an absolute requirement. This practice is merely suggested by the Islamic creed.\n \n This type of religious distortion is not isolated to Islam. For example, many Mormons believe that drinking caffeine is a violation of scripture, when it is recommended that followers of this religion simply avoid this and other substances. Nothing in the scripture actually suggests that it is one of God's laws. The general public's misunderstanding of what these religions entail is elevated by the distortions that many of the very followers of these religions have created.\n \n In Islam the reason it is suggested that women wear modest clothing is so they can be recognized as followers of the Qu'ran, and will not be confused as loose women, or prostitutes. Of course, this recommendation must be put into historical context. It was written in the 7th century, when the oldest profession in the world operated in a different manner. These days prostitutes are generally not picked up on the streets, but rather they are delivered like a pizza pie. Although times were different, the need for modesty still applies today, and on the surface this guideline is not a sinister one.\n \n The rise of political Islam has been marked by a remarkable mistreatment of women. In short, many of the radical Muslim sects have not only set out to establish theocratic states, which practice a convoluted version of Islam, but they have also effectively reduced the role of women to that of second class citizens. Saudi Arabia's Wahabi sect is just one example of this type of perversion of religion. The main symbol that depicts the plight of women in these unjust societies is the niqaab, the chador, or simply put the veiling of women.\n \n Women in these societies are treated as chattel. It is not uncommon in Saudi to see women sitting in the bed of a pickup truck, while the newly purchased camel sits comfortably in the cab protected from the elements. This is testament to the value that Wahabi sects place on the lives of their women. To them women are less important than cattle. In addition, rape victims may be stoned to death in what is called an honor killing.\n \n That being said; why then do we allow people to immigrate to our free and democratic societies and continue this practice of slavery and repression? Western cultures have made advances in the treatment of women in our own societies? We believe that both men and women are equal under the law, and are endowed with all of the same unalienable rights.\n \n Recently, a Florida case has put the issue of how western culture deals with fundamentalist Islamic practitioners out in the open. Before September 11th, Sultaana Freeman was allowed to take her drivers license photo under the veil. This was probably due to the politically correct environment that reigned during the Clinton years. However, somebody at the Florida DMV noticed this divergence from Florida law, and sent a notice to the women threatening to revoke her drivers license if she did not come in and take her photo unveiled. Now she has found an ACLU lawyer who is championing her case. The argument is that this violates her constitutionally protected freedom of religion. The state suggests that the face is an important biometric tool for identification, and 9-11 has changed the political environment. She lost round one, and plans to appeal this one 'all the way up'. \n \n I have a suggestion to the legislatures of the United States of America. Outlaw the veil, altogether. The Qu'ran does not require that the niqaab be worn by women. This is a tool of oppression that runs anti to the freethinking ideals that we subscribe to. In fact, we are at war with those Islamists who wish to establish a worldwide Islamic state. Terrorist organizations are being funded by those theocratic states already existing in the Middle East. The veil is the symbol of their insanity, and wish for absolute dominion over the world's people. We should not allow this practice, any more than we should allow Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), or polygamy, within our borders. Slavery was put to rest with the announcement of the Emancipation Proclamation of 1862, and later finalized with the bloodshed of approximately 650,000 Americans. To allow this goes against the result of an issue that once sharply divided this nation, and against the principles that established our democracy.\n \n It is no coincidence that moderate; democratic, Arab nations do not require this sinister style of dress, as the women in those nations wear the hijab. The hijab covers only the neck and hair, and is more in line with the actual teachings of Islam. Furthermore, it is no coincidence that the human rights in those countries are significantly higher.\n \n It is interesting to note that the French are currently discussing a ban of the niqaab in public areas. Not only is it philosophically consistent with western ideology, but it has practical national security implications. A ban of this Draconian practice is most definitely a step in the right direction in this war on terror.\n \n Sources: \n A brief exploration of the complex topic of hijab and face-veiling in Islam\n \n Is Hijab Compulsory? - \"The Qu'ran does not suggest that women should be veiled or they should be kept apart from the world of men. On the contrary, the Qu'ran is insistent on the full participation of women in society and in the religious practices.\"",
