It banned any and all forms of legal recognition for same-sex relationships, including domestic partnerships and other basic protections. \n \n In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Joseph Bataillon said the ban \"imposes significant burdens on both the expressive and intimate associational rights\" of gays and lesbians and \"creates a significant barrier to the plaintiffs' right to petition or to participate in the political process.\"\n\n \n And so it begins...",

The Constitution and all of its amendments are here, and I see nothing at all about marriage or privacy. If there is confusion over what rights are protected, the people may need to pass another amendment to clarify their intent.\n\n \n \n I went to the site you had linked and am pasting this\n \n Article III. - The Judicial Branch Note\n \n Section 1 - Judicial powers\n \n The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behavior, and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services a Compensation which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office.\n \n Section 2 - Trial by Jury, Original Jurisdiction, Jury Trials\n \n (The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority; to all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls; to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction; to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party; to Controversies between two or more States; between a State and Citizens of another State; between Citizens of different States; between Citizens of the same State claiming Lands under Grants of different States, and between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects.) (This section in parentheses is modified by Amendment XI.)\n \n \n This quite clearly states that it is the courts jurisdiction to rule on the constitutionallity of suits brought before them. They are also backed up by the 9th admendment that states\n \n Amendment IX - Construction of Constitution. Ratified 12/15/1791.\n \n The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\n \n Which means marriage and privacy are implied as 2 of those \"others retained by the people.\"",

That's the way civil rights issues have been dealt with for most of American history. One only needs to review the amendments to see that.\n\n \n Lets review the amendments, shall we? Ever legal expert who has commented on the issue claims that gay marriage cannot be banned due to the equal protection caluse fo the 14th amendment. Here it is:\n \n \nSection 1.\n All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n\n \n Sorry, it appears you are wrong. By passing a prhibition on gay marriage, there is no question that they are making or enfocing laws that abridge the privelages or immunities of citizens of the united states. Additionally, there is little question that they are denying them equal protection under the law.\n \n The other amendmant that exeperts seem to think that these statues violate is the 19th:\n \n \nThe right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.\n \n Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.\n\n \n To me this is a little less clear, since it specifically mentions voting. the supreme court has ruled though that coupled with the 14th amendment, there is absolutly no question that our constitution strictly prohibits discrimination based on sex. \n \n The qurestion of gay marriage is not a novel one, nor does it require a seperate amendment to deal with it. There have been over 30 million constitutional cases brought before the courts since this countries creation. You do not need a seperate amendment for each one (the constitution would fill several shelves if this was the case).\n \n There is only one quesiton here. Do you have the rigth to get married int he united states? The answer is certainly YES. Gay folks have the same rights as the rest of us.",

The problem is that you want to broaden the institution of marriage to include other sorts of arrangements.\n\n \n Oh dear. It is not a problem at all. Courts are able to determine what marriage is under the common law. The court in Mass. determined that the right to marry is an important right. It is also a private choice, that means nothing if one cannot marry a partner of one's choice.\n \n \nYou keep approaching this as if the idea that what you are trying to get should be considered a \"civil right,\" when in fact that jury is still out.\n\n \n I think JustineCredible explained what a civil right is very well.",

   "So if someone is from England, and says it \"doesn't work for me\" to drive on the right side of road and wants to drive on the left side, or claims that we should make special roads for them so they can drive the way that feels natural to them or that they are oriented toward, claiming discrimination, you'd be for them getting drivers' licenses to drive that way, or give them special roads?\n No. I think you may be misunderstanding how I was trying to relate the analogy to the issue of same-sex marriage. What I was trying to point out is that trying to treat people equally appears to demand that we account for salient differences. As handedness is salient in the use of can-openers, so is sexual orientation salient in the use of a marriage institution, the analogy was supposed to go. \n \n Now if your English driver had to drive a vehicle radically different in its configuration to your average North American automobile such that its use contravened American traffic laws, then I think that your reductio of the analogy might work. It might work because then your reductio would posit a salient difference - a vehicle whose regulation is not well provided for in existing American traffic law - of the same formal characteristics as handedness or sexual orientation. \n \n \nEveryone has the same right to marry. Just because some want to engage in sex acts with people of the same gender doesn't mean we should allow marriage to be used to validate or legitimize that behavior.\n How exactly same-sex marriage validates or legitimizes \"sex acts with people of the same gender\" I don't know. I'm talking about marriage, not \"sex acts\". If it was just about the \"sex acts\", then we (gays) would cheerfully flip you lot the bird and get on with it. Like you we have no interest in trying to validate or legitimize our sexual behaviour to people who don't share our sexual orientation, culture, or beliefs. \n \n Whatever sex acts we feel like performing are tangential to the partnership relationships we have. And like everyone else interested in marriage and families, we are interested in validating and legitimizing our relationships to our communities. \n \n What we do want is official recognition of our marriage relationships and legal protection for our families and partners. Well, that's what american gays want. Us Canadian XXXXXX get that already. :) \n \nI AM left handed and have dealt with right-handed things my whole life. I can deal with it, and have learned to do many things right-handed. I know better than to complain and whine that right-handed people get benefits that I don't, or that \"I'm not getting my rights!\"\n Okay, so it looks like the analogy does trivialize the issue. Do you think that, in the absurd situation that suddenly the vast majority of people were homosexual, you would be willing and able to adapt to homosexual behaviour like you adapted to right-handed behaviour?\n \n Handedness makes a poor analogy for your side because it is not that hard to do things in a way that is different from the handedness one starts with and learn to feel comfortable and normal with it after awhile.\n It's certainly a poor analogy if we extend it too far, I agree. \n \nI've always thought it was funny that gay rights people use the handedness analogy so often, because if we take handedness as a true and completely accurate analogy across the board, we would have to surmise that gay people could learn to have straight relationships and it be completely comfortable after awhile.

Which, of course, leads to accusations that whoever brought it up trivializes whatever it is being formally compared to. That's also why analogous reasoning succumbs so easily to reductio ad absurdem rebuttals - they're intended to cover limited cases.\n \n All that aside, is it clear to you what point I'm trying to make by bringing up that analogy?",

It's not been used to push for marriage as you like to claim, as someone else has said, you're disingenuous in that. \n Also, just because someone becomes comfortable with something doesn't necessarily mean it's right or even good for them. \n Smokers are \"comfortable\" with smoking, but it's dangerous for them and others around them. An Englishman driving on the left side of the road in England is fine and they become comfortable with it, but bring that left hand driver to the USA if he drives on the left hand side of the road he's now become DANGEROUS to himself and others! \n \n \n I've always thought it was funny that gay rights people use the handedness analogy so often, because if we take handedness as a true and completely accurate analogy across the board, we would have to surmise that gay people could learn to have straight relationships and it be completely comfortable after awhile. (something gay lobbyists insist, at all costs, can't be done.)\n\n \n Again, as I have said, just because someone becomes comfortable with a behavior does not mean that the behavior is right or even safe for that person. Especially when it effects so many aspects of their lives, their families, their interpersonal relationships...etc.",

   "When we've gotten to the point of saying anything-goes regarding marriage, why not? I can't say I'm surprised. Essentially what you are describing is a polygamous gay (or bisexual) marriage situation.\n I'm sorry, obviously I wasn't being clear enough. \n \n The situation is that some gays and lesbians, desiring the protection of marriage for their children, decide on an arrangement wherein two friends, one man and one woman, get married for the sake of the children - a marriage of legal convenience. \n \n These friends are legally married, but maintain their relationships with their respective partners.\n \nI am not sure what Nurglitch means, reading it again, especially considering the last sentence.\n I'm talking about how some gays and lesbians are dealing with the unfair situation in which they can't marry their partners to protect their children - instead they marry a friend.\n \n \nAt any rate, if this is happening, why are not gay people just marrying their close same-sex partners, instead of keeping them \"on ths side\"?\n For the obvious reason that gays cannot legally marry their same-sex partners in the US (except Massachusets, which is a poor 2nd place to full equality). In the absence of marrying your partner, a close friend of the opposite sex fills the requirements of the law and the necessary social relationship to maintain such a legal relationship.\n \nWas Nurglitch describing the affects of not legalizing same-sex marriage and closets?\n No, I was describing how some gays and lesbians deal with the current legal situation of marriage.\n \nHe or she was not saying all the partners should be married.\n Quite correct. The law only allows for two people of opposite sexes. Fortunately participating in a legal marriage doesn't prevent you from participating in a real marriage to your partner - hence the two extra people involved, which is a bonus when sharing out child-care duties. \n \nIf Nurglitch was merely describing a sort of polyamourous(if I am applying the correct term) situation, this could occur with an all-heterosexual situation, and regardless of whether or not same-sex marriage is legalized.\n It's not polyamourous because there are two pairs of partners friendly enough to raise a family together, rather than four partners.\n \nAgain, as I have said, just because someone becomes comfortable with a behavior does not mean that the behavior is right or even safe for that person. Especially when it effects so many aspects of their lives, their families, their interpersonal relationships...etc.\n Yup, the closet is a bad place for anyone to be in for any reason, especially in a free society.",
