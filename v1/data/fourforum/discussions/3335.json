   "Subject: HAVING FUN\n \n WORKING PEOPLE FREQUENTLY ASK RETIRED PEOPLE WHAT THEY DO TO MAKE THEIR DAYS INTERESTING:\n \n I WENT TO THE STORE THE OTHER DAY. I WAS ONLY IN THERE FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES. WHEN I CAME OUT, THERE WAS A CITY COP WRITING OUT A PARKING TICKET.\n \n I WENT UP TO HIM AND SAID, \"COME ON, BUDDY, HOW ABOUT GIVING A SENIOR A BREAK?\"\n \n HE IGNORED ME AND CONTINUED WRITING THE TICKET.\n \n I CALLED HIM A NAME. HE GLARED AT ME AND STARTED WRITING ANOTHER TICKET FOR HAVING WORN TIRES. SO I CALLED HIM A WORSE NAME. HE FINISHED THE SECOND TICKET AND PUT IT ON THE WINDSHIELD WITH THE FIRST. THEN HE STARTED WRITING A THIRD TICKET.\n \n THIS WENT ON FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES. THE MORE I ABUSED HIM THE MORE TICKETS HE WROTE.\n \n I DIDN'T CARE. MY CAR WAS PARKED AROUND THE CORNER, AND THIS ONE HAD AN \"ELECT JOHN KERRY\" BUMPER STICKER ON IT.\n \n I TRY TO HAVE A LITTLE FUN EACH DAY NOW THAT I'M RETIRED.\n \n IT'S IMPORTANT AT OUR AGE.",
