I have heard a few bad comments about them, especially when they first came out, but for the most part everything I have heard over the last 2 years seem to be great. I ask because I am really considering getting one when our 99 Cav goes. (yes, we still have a 99 Cav, and it gets close to 34mpg with a few simple and cheap one time modifications that have more than payed for themselves over the life of the car). I'm not ashamed to admit that I am a real miser when it comes to forking out my dough, and with present gas prices as is and the prospect of $4 gas this summer, I just can't stop thinking about 50mpg. I do have a large SUV that we use for long trips (we have 2 large dogs and a child), and it used to be my car to use all the time. But over the last year, days when I work and she does not, I have started to take the Cav for the better mileage. I have already realized a significant savings between 15mpg and 34mpg. \n \n Can anyone break this vehicle down to good points and bad points?",

According to a study by CNW Marketing, the total combined energy to produce a Prius (consisting of electrical, fuel, transportation, materials and hundreds of other factors over the expected lifetime), is greater than what it takes to produce a Hummer:\n \n The Prius costs an average of $3.25 per mile driven over a lifetime of 100,000 miles -- the expected lifespan of the Hybrid.\n The Hummer, on the other hand, costs a more fiscal $1.95 per mile to put on the road over an expected lifetime of 300,000 miles.\n That means the Hummer will last three times longer than a Prius and use almost 50 percent less combined energy doing it.\n Source: Chris Demorro, \"Prius Outdoes Hummer in Environ\n Here's the link to the original story in the Recorder by Chris Demorro.\n \n http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geu5OqTu5HYioAsxZXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTBybnZlZnRlBHNlYwNzcgRwb3MDMQRjb2xvA2FjMgR2dGlkAw--/SIG=12sb95m4r/EXP=1206886442/**http%3a//clubs.ccsu.edu/recorder/editorial/editorial_item.asp%3fNewsID=188",

The most obvious manipulation of data is the company&#8217;s choice of total vehicle lifetime miles for each vehicle.

While the majority of the price in Europe is tax related, the increases at the pump in the US are dollar related.

And if you got a raise to deal with it, along with everyone else, god knows how much more it would cost due to the general rise in inflation.

   "On the contrary, there is a substitute for cubic inches: technical know-how. Latest Dodge Viper: 8.4 litre v10 putting out 600 horsepower and 560 lb/ft torque. Latest Koenigsegg: 4.7 litre V8 putting out 1,018 bhp and 1,060 lb/ft torque. Even a Mitsubishi Evo 10, a four-door saloon with a two litre engine, beats the Viper around a track. A 1.8 litre Lotus Exige S will do it even quicker, and an Ariel Atom...\n \n You get the idea. It baffles Europeans how so many American cars manage to get so little power out of so much engine.\n\n \n As far as the viper is concearned, it has massive cubic inches. As far as the little toy cars you mentioned, you left out ptwr and track size, which would explain how these lower powered cars can turn better lap times. On a tight track, a car with less power has an advantage over a car with a lot of power, if the car with more power is not set up for a tight track and the lower powered car is. But road racing is not really my thing, I know a little about it but not much, my thing is the 1/4 mile, and horse power rules as does cubic inch displacement. I will admit that some modified foreign cars run respectable times at the strip, but in classes such as outlaw, pro modofied, pro stock, top sportsman, and pro gas, American cars rule hands down. And American made v-8 power plants dominate top fuel, 7,500 horse power, 0-320 mph in just over 4 seconds. Show me any import that could even come close to those figures.",

Even the 'toy' Atom is a second quicker.\n \nI will admit that some modified foreign cars run respectable times at the strip, but in classes such as outlaw, pro modofied, pro stock, top sportsman, and pro gas, American cars rule hands down.

You probably have also never heard the old saying that there is no substitution for cubic inches.\n\n What makes a 1/4 mile strip car with the turning circle of a 747 more 'real' than anything else? :) You like drag racing, and you want a car that gives you a flavour of that out on the road. Great! Speaking for myself, I'd take a Nissan GTR.",
