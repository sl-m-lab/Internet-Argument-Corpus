   "Mini nuclear plants to power 20,000 homes | Environment | The Observer\n \n I think I'd be more comfortable with something of this nature than with a conventional nuclear power station. There are still waste issues (persumably), but in terms of security, safety, and the risk of catastrophic accident it seems like a better bet. If one goes up in smoke then the area affected will be far smaller than that from Chernobyl, 3 Mile Island or Windscale.",

   "This seems to be a good idea. I am a little concerned though about hundreds of thousands of these reactors around. The thought of someone putting explosives near one and basically having a ready-made dirty bomb is a possibility. I would think security would also be an expensive proposition. The Chernobyl type disaster can't happen with plants made in the US since ours have very robust containment buildings housing them and are better made with over design and site specific design engineered in to them. 3 mile island there was no radiation leakage and the accident was compleatly contained. I think it would be better to have the larger plants since it would be easier to secure a couple thousand large plants than to try to secure hundreds of thousands of small ones. And security for refueling of these small plants and transport of the fuel would be a logistical nightmare. On any one day you could have many dozens of these refueling transports and waste transports on our roadways.",

   "And the Titanic can't sink...\n I always get worried when people start making these sort of statements, It tempts fate and betrays a potentially cavalier attitude to hazards.\n\n \n I always get worried when people with no knowledge on a subject try to discuss it. The reason that Chernobyl can't happen here is for a number of reasons the US containment design is a complete hand calc. of the entire building it has 20' thick concrete walls with an 8\" thick internal welded steel shell the rebar is over 2 inch's in diameter and completely welded together (not butt welded) set on 6\" centers and the mats are run on 4 axis (horizontal, vertical and criss crossed) the concrete is a monolithic pore at 7000 psi strength. To breach containment on a US plant it would take multiple hits (10-20) by a fully fueled 747 at steep decent in the exact same spot to breach containment. Containment for Chernobyl was a space metal building. Another reason is the control rods in Chernobyl were sodium filled rods they are not in the US plants. Do you know what happens when sodium is exposed to water? Another reason is in the US the systems have a triple redundancy. In the US plants public safety is the number one concern in the USSR it came last. The only similarities between the plants built in the US and the USSR is that they use the same fuel.\n \n I believe it is you with the cavalier attitude for the real facts and making statements on a subject that you know nothing about.",

   "The China syndrome was the common theory as to what would happen in the event of a melt down. Since 3-mile island it has been determined that the reaction would stop long before it could burn through the containment floor. Up until 3 mile island a test of the China syndrome theory was considered to be too dangerous and costly to attempt. The data gathered from the 3-mile island accident revealed that it would be physically impossible for the reaction to be sustained long enough to burn its way through the containment floor. There also was a design flaw found in the fuel rod assembly that was discovered, it was found that the tolerances were too tight and that under high temperatures would accelerate the reaction. It was found that by loosening up the tolerances the reaction in high temperatures would slow or stop with out any outside influence. The accident at 3-mile island actually was a good thing since it gave us invaluable information that other wise would have gone unknown.\n \n Actualy the reason that Chernobyl didn't go through a complete melt down is the reason I stated before the reaction is unsustainable. The containment breach at Chernobyl was caused by the explosion from when the control rods melted and exposed the sodium inside to the coolant water. The insueing shock wave from the explosion caused the partial colapse of the containment building.",
