They are in one of the most polluted parts of the world, they are forced to live with Africa to their South, Middle East to their Southeast, and big old Russia to their East.QUOTE]\n \n I don`t realy know if this is a big problem. First of all, the enviromental problems in europe is largely due to a concentrated population and old industries in eastern europe. I think that once the focus has been directed towards consumer pollution (rather than producer pollution) in western europe, the enviromental problems will slowly but surely decrease (as western europes population isn`t exactly exploding). The enviromental problems in eastern europe are being quite rapidly fixed. After the fall of the Soviet Union there have been large strides in cleaning up the pollution in eastern europe.\n \n As for neighbours. I don`t really see how those are a threat? I mean, sure Russia produces some unwanted international crime organisations, and those are quite troublesome, but other than that I don`t really see how sitting besides one of the larger markets in the world, filled with natural resources can be negative.\n \n \nI Their population growth is sputtering and their governments are reverting to socialism.\n \n\n \n The slow (or negtive) population growth is a problem for europe, but the trend is slowly reversing in the northern parts of europe (estimated to be followed by central europe and then lastly by southern europe). Eastern europe is also experiencing a slow growth (or decline), but this will hopefully be remedied by stabilizing their economies. \n \n As for socialism. Well, european socialism doesn`t seem to be such a bad idea. I don`t see how this would play an important part?\n \n \nI'm fairly worried that the EU is going to have to endure another collapse of Russia, the continued troubles of Africa, the terrorists of the Middle East, and a government whose basing itself on historically bad ideas over the next few decades and it will wear on them enough to make them fall from where they currently are.\n \n\n \n I don`t think Russia will collapse. It will have to go through some serious changes and there will be problems arising from this. But hardly on the scale of Chinas troubles. Nor do I realy see how African troubles or middle easter terrorism will affect europe to any greater degree than any other modern nation?\n \n As for the historicly bad ideas. What are those?\n \n \n\n I read a site recently that tried to predict what would happen in the next 30 years based on what was happening today and current trends. Their estimates were similar to mine showing that Europe will be third in line as far as economic powers go to the US and China. This of course assumes that China and the US don't have any type of political cold war or being another world war. Anyways, here is a link to the site if you want a good read.\n http://www.freeworldacademy.com/globalleader/trends.htm\n\n \n It was a good link, allthough the issue about Africa and Middle east puzzles me. I also wonder how they calculated the future economic growth for the new (and future) EU members and how they will change by joining EU. I`m a bit surprised that they mentioned nothing of europes unemployment figures. To me it seems like this is the most important challange for all of europe. If the larger countries i EU are succesful in their fight against high unemployment, I think Europe stands a chance of increasing its economic importance in the world. If not, I fear that europe will countinue to suffer from slow economic progress. \n \n Another issue I think that the authors has neglected about europe is the fact that europe is far from having common interests in general. The expansion of EU (both in terms of members and in common issues) creates a common interest in general. Europe stopped being an important player at the end of world war II, but by uniting under the same organisation, europe will have more influence.\n \n But all in all, I think that the US will continue its economic and military supremacy. But I am quite sceptical to China outgrowing USA anytime in the near future. Chinese economy still suffers from some heavy structural problems and its export fueled economy has been moving towards a ballance of imports and exports. Nor do I believe that China will become democratic anytime soon...",

Anyways, here is a link to the site if you want a good read.http://www.freeworldacademy.com/globalleader/trends.htm\n\n \n Good link. I do feel their opinions are somewhat generous regarding US economic growth. We're currently keeping our GDP (a crummy financial health measure to begin with) in a growth position with 75-80% consumer and government spending, primarily through debt in both sectors. Most economists (other than government and brokerage houses) feel 65% is an outside maximum for contemporary developed nations as it restricts real growth through trade, no new money. We still have to eventually finance all the debt we're accumulating at reasonable market rates, so I don't see our economy holding up with present rates of military expenditures combined with other government expansion (28% with this administration) based on debt, a declining industrial sector, unbalanced foreign trade (no new wealth) and the social expenses we face in the very near future. There's no balance or plan. In that respect, we're not unlike the former USSR. \n \n Africa is a write-off for as far out as I can think. That continent does have substantial natural resources, which will be consumed by developed nations, but proceeds will stop at the governing level without benefit to the populace. The Four Horsemen are also having quite a ride in all of Africa. \n \n I do see continued growth in the EU, nothing spectacular, but most member nations are far ahead of the rest of the world in redistribution of wealth to contain social ills and develop export income without incurring massive public debt. Those features alone have the potential of providing a solid base for an international currency not rocked by foreign policy and a declining industrial base as the dollar is currently experiencing. If oil producing nations do begin to accept the Euro as payment for goods, as is rumored in their quest to balance their income and investment portfolios, that alone could promote the EC's stability to a point of long-term financial health. \n \n The Western hemisphere is destined to become one entity even as individual nations retain their sovereignty by becoming suppliers to the US for basic goods. Mexico and other S. American nations are experiencing positive trade, especially with perishable foods, with the US, which will continue to increase in value as the US completes the change from industrial to service level economy. As a supplier of low-cost labor with diminishing birthrates and an aging population in the US, Mexico and S. America will keep their heads above water. Canada, with an abundance of natural resources to feed US consumption, is at the mercy of the US Economy. \n \n I don't see Russia collapsing, but I haven't taken a close enough look at all of the former USSR States to determine what their economies will do to support the former Mother Country without enlarging their problems with civil war.\n \n China. If one wanted a text-book economic model of central government control utilizing capitalism to grow the standard of living, that's China. With few indigent natural resources, China has accomplished the task of supplying adequate natural resources to fuel their rapidly growing industrial machine now and in the future through trade, without firing a shot. Long-range plans that are adhered to make China a subject worthy of discussion. As there are no plans beyond 2020 available to the public, I can't help but wonder what China sees beyond that point. \n \n I agree that Japan, like the US, is a declining power. They have the same problem we do; their standard of living has reached a high point where growth is limited by their high cost of goods sold and operating expenses. They'll eventually be competing with China for the vast potential Chinese consumer market and China isn't about to forget and forgive their treatment by the Japanese Empire during WWII.",

It seems plausible that we will see with China what we saw with Japan 100 years ago--a very rapid and successful modernization. But there is one major difference. Japan has 125 million people; China has 1.3 billion. So maybe in the future, we'll see the U.S., like European countries and the Soviets did, pull back on their excessively expensive imperialist ambitions, and possibly China may start to get the same kind of ambitions.

With the beginning of the computer age there were businesses springing up all over the place in the US. This is because of how widely this technology was to be used in our country and how it affected the ability of the workers to do high tech jobs long before other countries like Mexico or China could build a large work force in the area. Technology will have to continue to power our economy as we will still hold a strong technological advantage over lesser world economies for a long time.\n \n One of the best things to ever happen to the US was the Japanise economy. It helped us become more efficient in order to compete. We haven't had a challenge like them for a long time and have become far less efficient because of it. Perhaps the rise of a Chinese economic threat will again boost our own economy as we will have to become more efficient to compete.\n \n As for China becoming a military threat, I doubt this will happen. They are a growing economy and depend on that growth increasing in a controlled mannor in order to maintain their stability. If they were to attack Russia they would be attacking a major member of the UN. They would issolate themselves from the rest of the modern world who they depend on for imports and exports for their growing economy. They also depend on companies from all around the world operating within their borders which would get shut down in an event like this.

For years it was necessary for them to use Taiwan and Hong Kong as export facilities due to US paranoia regarding communism. The '70s changed all that, attracting investment capital and allowing China to undertake the modernization of their industrial infrastructure with the goal of removing the Taiwan/Hong Kong bottlenecks. Needless to say, they've succeeded to a point envied by many economies. I agree, I don't see China attacking anyone unless it's pure self-defense. Why spend the money and resources if you can get what you need through world markets. China plans way out there and looks at increasing costs of oil as just another a cost of doing business, as versus our political oriented cheap gasoline being a birthright to drive consumer sales of inefficient vehicles that drive a consumer/government dominated GDP based on debt. \n \n IMO the US, with regard to our military expenditures, is facing the same dilemma experienced by the former USSR, dwindling revenues and ever-increasing expenditures. There's a big difference between the two, that being our vast and increasing social program expenses and current ability to use debt as a means of continuing our binge. The USSR didn't have those issues. Greenspan's recent stern warning on our out-of-control deficit spending, a first in an election year, merely underscores our complete lack of long-range planning and the fact that sooner or later the piper will be there for payback, big time. We're performing a horrible disservice to our youth and future generations; they're going to have debt and government to service that will be crushing as our population ages and the work force shrinks. \n \n We're good at technology, but it doesn't create jobs, it reduces them and/or sends any manufacturing expansion based on technology to countries with lower costs of doing business. Technology is a two-edged sword in that it benefits many US companies but pushes us even faster into our two-tiered society of haves and have-nots, greatly increasing social costs and producing increased tax requirements.",

In addition, improved productivity results in higher wagers for workers. \n \n Couldn't we use protectionist measures to reduce the trend toward the two-tiered society?\n\n \n It also reduces the number of workers required to produce those same goods, effectively shrinking the potential market for the goods. To improve your standard of living with new technology, that means you have to have the ability to purchase those goods, difficult if new and improved gizmos have replaced your job or moved it to a country with lower production costs. \n \n Isolationist policies are ideal if you control virtually all world markets as we did following WWII. During that era we produced every component going into our products with the entire world as a market. Now, we don't even produce tool steel, a basic component for virtually all manufacturing processes. Any tariff we enact to protect middle class jobs, the recent steel and textile issues being excellent examples, increases the cost of those products to suppliers, distributors, construction firms and ultimately the consumer. All you're doing is raising the cost of imports to the level of domestic cost of production in unionized facilities, guaranteed to increase again each year with COLAs, merit, benefit and compliance costs not available as income increases to the general consumer. That will actually accelerate the demise of your society as antagonism develops towards your tariffs and your suppliers escalate prices on other products you're unable to produce on an internal basis while curtailing your credit as your exports are eventually non-existent due to price, meaning you have no new wealth entering your country. \n \n The former USSR and affiliated Iron Curtain countries are probably one of the best recent examples of what eventually happens with economic isolation in contemporary society. They eventually had to curtail ownership of Western products because there was no money or credit to import them or the necessary industrial items they couldn't produce on an internal basis but were required to run their basic industrial needs. Towards the end, black markets, with no tax revenue, began to flourish with used Western Levis bring over $50/pair while farm equipment couldn't harvest crops due to a lack of parts and military flights were reduced far below even minimum pilot qualifying hours due to the shortages of fuel. \n \n Our next financial crisis in the US outside the federal level is the galloping increases in cost of local government. Last time I looked, 46% of all government positions were unionized, with more climbing on the bandwagon all the time. The unions now play city/state against each other in their bargaining efforts, resulting in many public entities facing over 50% of their budgets going for salaries, benefits (retirement programs that would make a crooked CEO envious) and guaranteed increases each year from generally declining tax bases. That may eventually become the straw that breaks the camel's back. When in Rome......",

   "What you could do is to increase the capital invested in the workers and raise the individual productivity in that way. The problem is then how this should be accomplished and if the profit is worth the cost. One way could perhaps be re-structuring the educational system to facilitate abilities that are used in the production process.\n \n Another way could be to cut the societal costs by making consumption more efficient by correcting market failiures on particular goods that cause external costs on the society, like enviromentally harmful-, unhealthy- or socially harmful products. Another type of consumption you could try to make more efficient is goods that generate external profits, such as public transports or recycling. \n \n As for the unionization.\n \n I think US could benefit from a more centrally controlled bargaining process. By allowing central union organisations and employers organisation negotiate wage increases for the whole country you could avoid the situations of workers playing city/state against each other during periods of shortages and vice versa when there is high unemployment in particular labour sectors",
