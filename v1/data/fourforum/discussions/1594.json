   "It has come to my attention that America is hypocritical. When the heat was on, and the Japanese were preparing for the long-haul in world war 2, america decided it would kill women and children instead of offering peace. America could have detonated its two Atomic Bombs off the coast of Japan, or on military targets, and that would have ended the war. but America dropped two atomic bombs on civilian cities knowing full well the death they would cause. America has never even issued an apology. \n \n The terriorsts who want to presrve the sanctity of Islam have been trying to fight off materialisum and curroption, but the enemy they fight, america, has infinte resources, infinte power and infinite influence. The Islamic radicalists don't want there most holy day, to become like our Christmas, bloated and based soully on tradition with little or no regard to the actual spiritual imporantce of the day. Eventually the Islamic radicalists decided america can only be stopped through terror. And embarked on a mission to stopped the death of their religion through any means nessesary.\n \n Now my question is, should a nation who killed hundreds of thousands of civilians just so they could strike fear into the hearts of the japanese be able to call the murder of several thousand of its citizens an atrocity? Is the thing that seperates acceptable casualties and Mass-murder simply who is doing the killing? Tell me what you think, and please, none of those American Patriot Christians with their all to stupid answers that make absoultly no sense.",

We probably saved a million American lives by doing it, and millions of Japanese lives too, ironically enough.\n \n It is in no way comparable to terrorism.\n\n \n \n Terrorism was really spawned in France's Reign of Terror, or when the term became familiarized with people all around. Terrorism is a tactic used to conjure up great fear and throw a nation in disarray. This is exactly what the Hiroshima/Nagasaki bombs were dropped for. There's also evidence that points toward Japan willing to surrender in April 1945 as long as the Americas didn't harm their emperor, but they were denied this grant. Thus, the war went on and on. \n The Japanese also had practically no oil, no airpower and their navy had been crippled and essentially annihilated by the Americans and we also had a plethora of sea blockades that really kept them at bay, so to speak. American planes flew quite casually and freely over cities like Tokyo, because Tokyo was a shambles. It had been blown to XXXX earlier in 1945, killing 120,000 civilians and creating 3,100,000 refugees. This sounds like a terror tactic to me. A way in which we attempted to force them in to acquiescence by shattering their empire through vast destruction. These things occurred in Germany, too, they were employed to and aimed to lower German morale, but instead it just bolstered it. The destruction of densely populated civilian cities and the deaths of hundreds of thousands of civilians certainly can correlate with terrorism.\n \n I don't believe this coincides directly with the Jihadists and political terrorists, but psychologically it does have similarities to contemporary terrorism. I'm not an advocate of either, as I think attempting to grip a nation with fear and force their capitulation is a method that will give rise to belligerence and a slew of other things that will increase deaths.\n Truman endeavored to drop both bombs at the climax of this war. There are those who believe it was necessary for \"peace\" - peace through violence - and there are those who think it was unnecessary. Each side will remain adamant and very vehement on this and will not be swayed.\n \n Now, I'm certainly not an advocate of the tactics implemented by terrorists modern-day, but I'm also against terror tactics in warfare and they will do nothing but increase what they set out to terminate: violence.\n And I'm not in agreement with this Draconis bloke at all as Islam is a vast religion that lives abroad and is not being \"corrupted\" or stymied by American intervention. Unless he's referring to the suicide bombers that have been increasing in the past few decades. But I doubt that problem can be ascribed to American influence anymore than it can be to technology and the proliferation of weapons.",

   "You think the Japanese knew what we had? The nation was stunned after we dropped the first bomb. The reason we dropped it where we did was because there was a massive Japanese naval facility there. That was the target.\n \n\n \n So because there was a military base in proximity to a city it makes it justifiable to drop a weapon that can potentially, and did, kill over one-hundred thousand people? Please, that's totally irrelevant. In wartime Japan there was rarely one large civilian city that didn't possess some sort of military factory or arms manufacturer.\n Americans were desensitized to the Japanese people. They were characterized as being treacherous and remorseless beings whose goals were to domineer the globe whilst raping, pillaging and murdering our allies. Which was true for a great deal of their military as was shown in Manchuria, but one can't generalize against the people on the military's behalf. I suggest you read \"Baa Baa Black Sheep\" by Pappy Boyington to learn a bit about the Japanese during World War II.\n We also held them in our own \"concentration camps\" as to avoid espionage and to keep them from corresponding with their apparent overseas allies that they were assisting in some conspiracy against the United States.\n \n \nWe waited several days to drop the second bomb. Japan was still refusing to surrender, so we went ahead and dropped it.

Although some contend that a groundwar was inevitable without the atomic bombs, I'll have to disagree. I find this dubious at best.\n A groundwar was very unlikely, and they had no oil-supply to make their navy mobile or effective. \n \n \nA lot of people were killed. Even more were spared as a result. How many Japanese civillians would have been killed if we had had to invade Japan?\n\n \n Again, there are many historians who agree that a Japanese groundwar was unlikely because at the moment the war was a stalemate and the Japanese were going nowhere. We had already usurped all the islands they had previously controlled and the Russians were pushing them out of Manchuria. They were beaten. Forcing them into submission with atomic bombs was not necessary. It was more or less a display of power to stun and astonish the soviets.

This is simply not true.\n As for the article I'll see if I can't locate it. I read a while back and it was pretty convincing to me.

A lot of Japanese officers committed suicide instead of surrendering to the US... so....\n\n \n You're having trouble distinguishing the government from the people. There's a big difference, and just because the government is in favor of certain things doesn't mean the people in general are. \n There were Japanese officers and soliders who did this, but there were also many who gave in, hence the fact there were many deserters and people who fled to homeland Japan. Probably a stout number, too. However, I'm having trouble locating the statistics for the Japanese on Google. Seems it's a bit American biased. You also must realize that because of propaganda many of these soldiers' perceptions on things were distorted. A great many were told the Americans would show them no mercy and would shoot them rather than take them PoW because of the Bataan Deathmarch and because of Pearl Harbor, and even perhaps for the slaughter at Nanking. Everyone they had been told was repugnantly distorted and warped. It really help to alter their beliefs.\n You are generalizing and only viewing things from one perspective, which is completely and utterly improper. Yes, there were extremists, but you can't assume that every Japanese civilian was under the almighty Emperor's sceptre and was willing to throw down their lives without thought to better their emperor's wishes. There were also many men who were moderate, many who led normal lives and enlisted in the military for other reasons. You're accusing the Japanese of all being bloodthirsty drones with no real drive or incentive other than to kill mercilessly for the emperor's name.\n This is as indecent as maligning all German members of their military as brutal, ruthless anti-semites and slayers of children and wives. This is only true for the SS, Gestapo and some divisons of the Panzer regiment. \n \n \nIn Imperial Japan the Emperor was not just a leader, he was a God on Earth. The people of Japan had never even seen or heard the Emperor, so when he comes on over the radio and tells you to surrender to the Americans you can bet that you're going to do it.\n\n \n Sure, that's your perception and the general American public - who know nothing about Japan and their culture - will attest to that. Not everyone agrees with the leader, and it's no different in a monarchy.\n Of course there were die-hards, but after the strenuous firebombings in Japan they were totally demoralized and most of them had lost faith in their \"God-like\" emperor because of the refugees and deaths. I'm sure the 15,000,000 refugees following the Tokyo firebombing were still die-hard supporters of their emperor, right? Because you've polled them and the general consensus was this, right? Have you read anything about wartime Japan before? If not, I suggest you do to open your mind up a bit. It seems to be clogged terribly. The evil things are all documented and perverted, whereas normality is a bit hard to find when you're discussing World War II Japan. You also realize immediately after Pearl Harbor a group of Americans captured some Japanese naval men who had been stranded on the shores of Pearl Harbor after their five-man submarine had been sunk? By your logic, they wouldn't have lived on to become PoW's because all of the Japanese were loons and they were all die-hard victims of idolatry. I've scrutinized Google up and down and can't locate any records on Japanese PoW's. But I assure you I won't relent and when I locate some records I will be happy to post them.\n I'm tired of seeing the Japanese people of that era demonized and dehumanized because of the actions their military took, and the fact that there were some nuts who were manipulated by propaganda. You probably also believe all the Germans in World War II were Nazis and Hitler-supporters, but I don't want to get into that.\n I'm sure you're not even aware of the real impetus behind World War II as far as the Japanese declaring war on the Americans. Knowing the Americans were people of retribution, in that instance, I would've opted for suicide as well. Americans were spawned from the Anglos and other european nations, all know for their impetuousity.\n \n here's an article on whether or not Hiroshima was a necessity:\n http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v16/v16n3p-4_Weber.html\n \n It's quite eye-opening, I think, and it's supported by many great historians and strategists.",

One was meant to end a war, one was meant to start a war. While dropping the bomb killed a large amount of people, it undoubtably saved lives in the long run. The 9/11 attacks killed a comparatively small amount of people, however the death toll is still rising as a result of their actions. Remember, America had been attacked by Japan first, and after years of war America brought the war to a close. True terrorism would have been taking the bomb and dropping it on Brazil just to scare the XXXX out of them. Regardless of your ethical view of dropping the bomb, it was not unprovoked.",

It's very nice for us to say 'they hate us because we are so great', it allows us to feel superior and justified, it allows us to continue without looking at the destruction we cause them and just feel sorry for ourselves.\n \n The fact is that many Arabs see that the US had long ago declared war upon them.

All of these things are more than enough reason to feel rightful resentment towards the US, it is so much more than jealousy.\n\n \n why do you think that the arabs think US has declared war on them? or is it that the US has abandoned them despite talks of freedom and democracy while allying with their despotic leaders. truth is the US has done more for them than anyone else. when france-UK wanted the canal vs egypt, the US intervened on egypt's side. when kuwait was taken, it was the US lead coalition. \n \n Jordan now has a freetrade agreement with the US for over 3 years and their export to the US has grown more than 30%. Morocco just signed a similar agreement. the US \"aggressive\" economic policies have only improved their export to the US and grown the trade deficit for the US. not much of a win for the US trade wise and yet we continue to pursue it.\n i think the misperception of the US activities is rampant.\n \n \nJordan suffers from an important trade deficit, with imports twice as high as exports. Iraq has remained Jordan's most important trade partner over the past years despite the embargo and most Jordanian exports go to the Gulf region. Trade links between the EU and Jordan are stable: in 2001 and 2002 less than 5% of the country's exports went to the EU (EUR 160 million) while around one third of its imports came from the EU (EUR 1 800 million). *On imports, six partners account for more than 60% of total imports (EU 28%, Iraq 13%, USA 10%, Japan 5%, and Turkey 4%, and Saudi Arabia 4%). The difference between export destinations and the origin of imports means that Jordan has a trade surplus with countries in the region, but has a trade deficit with the other main trading partners. This trade deficit is partially offset by a surplus in services, mostly through tourism and remittances from Jordanians working abroad. The US is, however, rapidly increasing its importance as export destination of Jordan, accounting for around 20% of total exports due to the success of exports of products from the Qualifying Industrial Zones. \n\n Link \n quick calculation of a 2:1 trade deficit with 10% US import and 20% US export suggest things are pretty even and with continued growth of export to the US, it will likely become a surplus.\n \n curiously enough, the war in iraq has ended the sanctions against iraq, making it a economic player in the region again for all.\n \n no, certainly i don't think jealousy or resentment is the sole reason. and i didn't listed it as a sole reason.",

   "why do you think that the arabs think US has declared war on them?\n\n \n For reasons listed before. I do not think that they are justified to feel this in all cases, nor to the extent that the do. But I do really think that the 'jealousy' theory is just a cop out, an easy way to inflate our egos and explain away people not liking us.\n \n The Africa Growth and Opportunity Act encourages African countries to export items to the US... As long as they are not items that will negatively affect US producers, to a limit of 3.5% of all US imports, some items must still contain US raw materials (forcing Africa to import US materials over their own before production, only to export them back afterwards) and the US can cancel this at any time without notice or penalty. In return it insists that all trade and investment barriers must be eliminated from US firms in Africa, US firms must be treated as equals to African firms in Africa, they must remove African government subsidies and enforce further privatisation of government public services. How very kind of America.\n \n I will not deny that the US does not help some counties, but only when it can be guaranteed not to loose out in anyway, and only in return for stringent concessions. \n \n And those are the lucky ones who have deals, the US has numerous restrictions on import, both financial and psychological (the 'buy American' propaganda) especially financial on items that developing countries supply (eg rice, coffee and sugar). Simultaneously it puts pressure on the WTO and IMF to bully the same countries into higher imports, often so high that it has destroyed the country's economic and agricultural base as farmers find themselves unable to compete with these imports.\n \n And as for doing more than anyone else: the US gives in foreign aid proportionally less than almost every other foreign nation. And the country that receives the most is unsurprisingly Israel. On top of that the US Agency for International Development admits that almost 80% of USAID contracts 'go directly to American firms'.\n \n I'm a bit worried I'm appearing a ranting lefty here, I'm not. I do really believe in free trade, but what we have is not that. What we have is a system for the US to exploit the poorer countries for it's own benefit, and not a system that allows free and fair international trade for the benefit of all.",

He only says \"WMDs\" because its alot easier to explain to a crowd of people, who have an average IQ three points higher then a rattle-snake, that \"Saddam is gonna kill ya unless we blouss him up\", rather then \"the U.S. has made some mistakes and we need to show the Arab community, and the Middle-East in general, that a democracy is not only a good choice, but a profitable and better one then religious-fanatical rule\". And of course Mr. Bush went into Iraq to get Oil\n \n The main reason for the need of a stable democracy was that before 9/11 the U.S. thought it could mess with people and have dictators and radicalists ruling countries and be fine, but as shown, they will come back and bite the U.S. in the butt. So Mr. Bush thought it time to end the threat of rouge, religious-ruled countries by giving an example to all of them.

   "Your ignorance suprises me...\n \nIt has come to my attention that America is hypocritical. When the heat was on, and the Japanese were preparing for the long-haul in world war 2, america decided it would kill women and children instead of offering peace. America could have detonated its two Atomic Bombs off the coast of Japan, or on military targets, and that would have ended the war. but America dropped two atomic bombs on civilian cities knowing full well the death they would cause. America has never even issued an apology. \n \n The terriorsts who want to presrve the sanctity of Islam have been trying to fight off materialisum and curroption, but the enemy they fight, america, has infinte resources, infinte power and infinite influence. The Islamic radicalists don't want there most holy day, to become like our Christmas, bloated and based soully on tradition with little or no regard to the actual spiritual imporantce of the day. Eventually the Islamic radicalists decided america can only be stopped through terror. And embarked on a mission to stopped the death of their religion through any means nessesary.\n \n Now my question is, should a nation who killed hundreds of thousands of civilians just so they could strike fear into the hearts of the japanese be able to call the murder of several thousand of its citizens an atrocity? Is the thing that seperates acceptable casualties and Mass-murder simply who is doing the killing? Tell me what you think, and please, none of those American Patriot Christians with their all to stupid answers that make absoultly no sense.\n\n \n Are you American? If so, would you like to be without your grandpa's, your uncles, your older male relatives? Because that's exactly what the case would be, had the war continued with Japan. As previously stated, an invasion was the only other means necessary to win the war. Millions of our troops would have died to make sure Americans keep their freedom, which Japan threatened.\n \n Terrorism you say? The Japanese themselves sneak attacked Pearl Harbor, killing thousands of our military men. They started a WAR. They knew what the implications would be. \n \n We were attacked by cowards who are not brave enough to bare the military garb of a soldier. Instead, they crashed planes into a building killing thousands. They started a WAR too. And we have finished one war and are working on the other. But the terrorists dare not to fight in combat versus our troops. Instead they are indoctrined with how \"Allah\" will be proud of them if they sacrifice themselves to kill \"infidels\". What have we done wrong? Because we are rich that makes us evil? I admit America is losing its morals, but is that reason for attack? Thats like saying becuase the Muslim morals are different from Christian ones, the Crusades were justified.\n \n please respond I would love to continue.",

   "So it is far better for millions of Japanese civilians to die than millions of American troops?\n\n \n Well you have to measure the odds. Japanese would have been killed either way. Millions more would have been killed in a full scale invasion (including millions of Japanese and millions of US troops). And by the way, not even 500,000 Japanese died, although many suffer from adverse affects of the bombs. The Japanese civilians were prepared to fight to the very last, at the order of their god-emporer. \n \n And about \"no warning\". American officials DID issue a warning to Japan about a very dangerous and extremely deadly weapon the United States had and would use if Japan did not surrender.\n \n \n \nThis is not the reason. Rightly or wrongly these extremists percieve a very real act of aggression from the west in general and the US in particular. Until Americans realise this thi conflict can never be properly resolved.\n\n What have we done again? They falsely think we were hostile towards them? Oh I'm sorry and HOW exactly do we correct that? We spend extremely large sums of money, more than most other countries, to fund the UN and support groups for countries which need help. This is because we can, and for the most part, want to help. They percieve help as hatred? Wow, I'm sorry. Guess we should just nuke them, that'd make them real happy then wouldn't it. I feel that Islam is at the core of the problems. (I know I will be blasted about how this is not true but...) The Qu' ran preaches as much hatred, violence, and murder as it does peace and loving. It does not preach acceptance, but to kill \"infidels\", which is anyone who does not practice Islam. Mohammed and his followers killed thousands. Modern terrorists derive their inspiration from Mohammed and carry out their despicable atrocities in the name of his god. Modern day disciples of Mohammed respond to the terrorist attacks by cheering in the streets. Many Muslims are peaceful and peace-loving because they do not strictly follow the teachings of their founder. Mohammed allowed that a Mullah, Imam, or Mufti of Islam can be a terrorist. Mohammed ordered death to the Jews (see A. Guillaume, The Life of Muhammad, Oxford University Press [1975], p. 369). The Koran says, \"Fight in the cause of Allah\" (Qu'ran 2.244). The Koran says, \"Fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them\" (Qu'ran 9.5). The Koran says, \"I will inspire terror into the hearts of unbelievers\" (Qu'ran 8.12). The Koran (Qu'ran) is a terrorist manual which condones fighting, conflict, terror, slaughter, and genocide against those who do not accept Islam. Mohammed's Mission was to conquer the world for Allah. Terrorism is defined as \"The unlawful use or threatened use of force or violence by a person or an organized group against people or property with the intention of intimidating or coercing societies or governments, often for ideological or political reasons.\" A terrorist is defined as one who partakes in terror. While a soldier is one that USUALLY fights honorably and always for a reason.",

   "Christianity is as much soaked in blood as Islam. The Crusades, the Inquisition, the Missions. All spread Christianity by conquest and oppression.\n\n \n The point I was trying to make is that in the beginning of Christianity it was not spread through the spilling of blood, as was Islam. Jesus and his immediate followers never spilt blood in the name of the Lord, but instead took much torture in his name. But in the name of Allah, Muhammed, killed many and went through numerous conquests. After that his immediate followers then killed many, many more, as instructed by Allah in the Koran (Qu' ran), written by Muhammed. My point is, that no one or thing is innocent. Here is something on the Crusades. The quoted work is a book by Philip Jenkins...\n \n \"In recent years, a powerful social movement has demanded that the West, and specifically the churches, apologize for the medieval crusading movement. In this view, the Crusades represented aggression, pure and simple, against the Muslim world, and nobody can deny the resulting wars involved their share of atrocities. Underlying the movement for apology, though, is the assumption that religious frontiers are somehow carved in stone, and that Muslim states of the Near East must always and infallibly have been destined to be part of the world of Islam. An equally good case can be made that the medieval Middle East was no more inevitably Muslim than other regions conquered by Islam and subsequently liberated, like Spain and Hungry.\n \n \"Nor, curiously, do Westerners suggest that Muslims apologize for the aggressive acts that gave them power over those various lands in the first place. Westerners have simply forgotten the [brutalization and conquest of these] once great Christian communities of the Eastern World.\" \n \n (Ed. Note: Muslims never apologize for anything. They claim all their acts are by Allah's will and direction through Muhammad as recorded in the Qur'an/Koran. So, for them, no apologies are due for the 9/11World Trade Center bombing or anything else.)\n \n The fact is that the Crusades were a \"jihad\" in reverse is easily proved by early Christian History. Muslims insist that Christians willingly converted to Islam. Three indisputable facts contradict that claim.\n \n 1. For the first 300 years of Christianity. the followers of Jesus would accept torture and death from the Roman Empire rather than forsake their commitment to Jesus. They believed any revocation of their declared faith would earn them a ticket into Hell. There is no reason they would have willingly changed their faith from Jesus to Muhammad except by force. Islam does not promise paradise for believers, as does Christianity. Even Muhammad said he did not know his final reward. That would only be determined on his judgment day.\n \n 2. Next, Islam had conquered Spain in addition to North Africa and the Middle East. When the Moors attempted to extend their empire into Europe, they were met at Tours by Charles Martel and were soundly defeated. From that point forward, Islam was pushed out of Spain. So, if Christians willingly converted to Islam, why did they resist it at Tours and push it out of Europe?\n \n 3. Christians never would have willingly given up their \"holy\" cities of Jerusalem and Alexandria.\n \n \n Here is something from Crisis Magazine:\n \n \"So what is the truth about the Crusades? Scholars are still working some of that out. But much can already be said with certainty. For starters, the Crusades to the East were in every way defensive wars. They were a direct response to Muslim aggression--an attempt to turn back or defend against Muslim conquests of Christian lands. \n \n \"Christians in the eleventh century were not paranoid fanatics. Muslims really were gunning for them. While Muslims can be peaceful, Islam was born in war and grew the same way. From the time of Mohammed, the means of Muslim expansion was always the sword. Muslim thought divides the world into two spheres, the Abode of Islam and the Abode of War. Christianity--and for that matter any other non-Muslim religion--has no abode. Christians and Jews can be tolerated within a Muslim state under Muslim rule. But, in traditional Islam, Christian and Jewish states must be destroyed and their lands conquered. When Mohammed was waging war against Mecca in the seventh century, Christianity was the dominant religion of power and wealth. As the faith of the Roman Empire, it spanned the entire Mediterranean, including the Middle East, where it was born. The Christian world, therefore, was a prime target for the earliest caliphs, and it would remain so for Muslim leaders for the next thousand years.\n \n \"With enormous energy, the warriors of Islam struck out against the Christians shortly after Mohammed's death. They were extremely successful. Palestine, Syria, and Egypt--once the most heavily Christian areas in the world--quickly succumbed. By the eighth century, Muslim armies had conquered all of Christian North Africa and Spain. In the eleventh century, the Seljuk Turks conquered Asia Minor (modern Turkey), which had been Christian since the time of St. Paul. The old Roman Empire, known to modern historians as the Byzantine Empire, was reduced to little more than Greece. In desperation, the emperor in Constantinople sent word to the Christians of Western Europe asking them to aid their brothers and sisters in the East.\n \n \"That is what gave birth to the Crusades. They were not the brainchild of an ambitious pope or rapacious knights but a response to more than four centuries of conquests in which Muslims had already captured two-thirds of the old Christian world. At some point, Christianity as a faith and a culture had to defend itself or be consumed by Islam. The Crusades were that defense.\n \n \"Pope Urban II called upon the knights of Christendom to push back the conquests of Islam at the Council of Clermont in 1095. The response was tremendous. Many thousands of warriors took the vow of the cross and prepared for war. Why did they do it? The answer to that question has been badly misunderstood. In the wake of the Enlightenment, it was usually asserted that Crusaders were merely lacklands and ne'er-do-wells who took advantage of an opportunity to rob and pillage in a faraway land. The Crusaders' expressed sentiments of piety, self-sacrifice, and love for God were obviously not to be taken seriously. They were not just a front for darker designs. \n \n \"During the past two decades, computer-assisted charter studies have demolished that contrivance. Scholars have discovered that crusading knights were generally wealthy men with plenty of their own land in Europe. Nevertheless, they willingly gave up everything to undertake the holy mission. Crusading was not cheap. Even wealthy lords could easily impoverish themselves and their families by joining a Crusade. They did so not because they expected material wealth (which many of them had already) but because they hoped to \"store up treasure where rust and moth could not corrupt.\" They were keenly aware of their sinfulness and eager to undertake the hardships of the Crusade as a penitential act of charity and love. \n \n \"Europe is littered with thousands of medieval charters attesting to these sentiments, charters in which these men still speak to us today if we will listen. Of course, they were not opposed to capturing booty if it could be had. But the truth is that the Crusades were notoriously bad for plunder. A few people got rich, but the vast majority returned with nothing.\" \n \n \n \n \n Crisis Magazine published and copyrighted this in April 2002. The full text of this article by Thomas F. Madden is at:\n \n http://www.crisismagazine.com/april2002/cover.htm/\n \n Here is an excerpt from the articel located at:\n \n http://www.ewtn.com/library/CHISTORY/ZCRUSADE.HTM\n \n \n A ZENIT DAILY DISPATCH\n \n Crusades: Truth and Black Legend\n \n Italian Writer Vittorio Messori Joins Debate\n ROME, 27 JUL 1999 (ZENIT).\n \n Debate over the nature of the Crusades has not abated in this 900th anniversary year of the first Crusade. At the end of the millennium it might well be exacerbated by lack of understanding between the West and Islam.\n \n According to Italian Catholic writer Vittorio Messori, the Enlightenment cast a \"black legend\" shadow on the Crusades, and used it as a weapon in its psychological war against the Roman Catholic Church. In an article in \"Corriere della Sera,\" Italy's most important newspaper, Messori wrote, \"In order to complete the work of the Reformation, it was 18th century Europe that began the chain of 'Roman infamies' that have become dogma.\"\n \n \"In connection with the Crusades, it was anti-Catholic propaganda that invented the name, just as it invented the term Middle Ages, chosen by 'enlightened' historiography to describe the parenthesis of darkness and fanaticism between the splendors of Antiquity and the Renaissance. It goes without saying that those who attacked Jerusalem 900 years ago would have been very surprised had they been told that they were engaged in what eventually would be known as the 'first Crusade.' For them it was an itinerary, a 'pilgrimage,' a route, a passage. Those same 'armed pilgrims' would have been even more surprised had they foreseen the accusations leveled against them of trying to convert the 'infidel,' of securing commercial routes to the West, of creating European 'colonies' in the Middle East...\"\n \n Sadly, Messori said, \"the dark invention of the 'Crusade' has ended by instilling a feeling of guilt in the West, including among some members of the Church, who are ignorant of what really happened.\" In addition, \"in the East, the legend has turned against the entire West: we all pay -- and will continue to pay, the consequences of the Islamic masses' desire for revenge, of their call for vengeance against the 'Great Satan,' which, by the way, is not just the United States, but the whole of Christianity, the very one responsible for the 'Crusades.' After all, is it not Westerners themselves who insist on saying that it was a terrible, unforgivable aggression against the pious, devout and meek followers of the Koran?\"\n \n \"But there is a question we must ask ourselves. In the context of more than a thousand years of Christian-Islamic relations, who has been the victim and who the aggressor?\" asked the journalist who interviewed the Pope in \"Crossing the Threshold of Hope.\" When Caliph Omar conquered Jerusalem in 638, the city had been Christian for over three centuries. Soon after, the Prophet's disciples invaded and destroyed the glorious churches of Egypt, first, and then of North Africa, causing the extinction of Christianity in places that had had Bishops like St. Augustine. Later it was the turn of Spain, Sicily and Greece, and the land that would eventually become Turkey, where the communities founded by St. Paul himself were turned into ruins. In 1453, after seven centuries of siege, Constantinople, the second Rome, capitulated and became Islamic. The Islamic threat reached the Balkans but, miraculously, the onslaught was stopped and forced to turn back at Vienna's walls. If the Jerusalem massacre of 1099 is execrated, Mohammed II's action in Otranto [Italy] in 1480 must not be forgotten, a raw example of a bloody funeral procession of sufferings,\" Messori stated.\n \n Messori concluded by asking a number of questions: \"At present, what Moslem country respects the civil rights and freedom of worship of any other than their own? Who is angered by the genocide of Armenians in the past, and of Sudanese Christians at present? According to the devotees of the Koran, is the world not divided between the 'Islamic territory' and the 'war territory' -- all those areas that must be converted to Islam, whether they like it or not?\"\n \n The Italian journalist provided his answers to these questions in his final remarks. \"A simple review of history, along very general lines, confirms an obvious truth: Christianity is constantly on the defensive when it comes to Moslem aggression; this has been the case from the beginning until now. For example, in Africa at present there is a bloody offensive by the Moslems to convert ethnic groups that the heroic sacrifices of generations of missionaries had succeeded in baptizing. Admittedly, some in the course of history need to ask for forgiveness. But, in this instance, must it be Catholics who ask for forgiveness for actions in self-defense, and for keeping the road open for pilgrimage to Jesus' places, which was the reason for the Crusades?\" ZE99072705",

(and bordering on jingoistic) Furthermore, why should \"all Muslims\" apologize for 9/11?? Were \"all Muslims\" involved? I do not think that those not involved should to have to make amends or take responsibility for the actions of a few....otherwise \"all Americans\" would be guilty of some pretty heinous deeds. \n \n As to the later claim in the essay that the Crusaders were altruistic and devoted in their invasion... rubbish. Those historians seemed to conveniently forget about the sacking/rape/destruction of Constantinople (which was the central and most advanced Christian culture at the time) by the Crusaders!!\n \n In addition, Islam has been the only religion which has historically allowed freedom of religion in a religious State. Take Spain (or Andalucia, as it was called by Muslims) for example. There Christians, Muslims, and Jews all lived and worked in harmony. In fact, they re-introduced Europe to the \"Classics\" (of Greece and Rome) in addition to the advanced works of Muslim scholars from the Mid-East (Algebra, Medicine, etc.). This continued until the Reconquista, after which the Catholics embarked on a campaign of terror and religious persecution.\n \n In summation, as Phunting said, all 3 of the \"great\" religions are soaked in blood and their holy texts all have references which encourage such behaviour. However, I do have to say that their general message is one of peace, understanding, and community.",
