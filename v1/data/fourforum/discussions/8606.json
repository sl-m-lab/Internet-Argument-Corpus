   "But Me Ye Have Not Always. John 12:8\n \n OK, Christ, I take it, lingers not amongst the poor in the parks of Las Vegas?\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/28/us/28homeless.html\n \n July 28, 2006\n Las Vegas Makes It Illegal to Feed Homeless in Parks \n By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD\n LAS VEGAS, July 21 - Gail Sacco pulled green grapes, bread, lunch meat and, of course in this blazing heat, bottles of water from a cardboard box. A dozen homeless people rose from shady spots in the surrounding city park and snatched the handouts from her.\n \n Ms. Sacco, an advocate for the homeless, scoffed at a city ordinance that goes into effect Friday making it illegal to offer so much as a biscuit to a poor person in a city park.\n \n Las Vegas, whose homeless population has doubled in the past decade to about 12,000 people in and around the city, joins several other cities across the country that have adopted or considered ordinances limiting the distribution of charitable meals in parks. Most have restricted the time and place of such handouts, hoping to discourage homeless people from congregating and, in the view of officials, ruining efforts to beautify downtowns and neighborhoods.\n \n But the Las Vegas ordinance is believed to be the first to explicitly make it an offense to feed \"the indigent.\"\n \n The ordinance does not apply to the famous Las Vegas Strip, which lies mostly in unincorporated Clark County, but it demonstrates both the growing pains the city has endured as tourism has boomed, and the steps Las Vegas is taking to regulate where entrenched populations of homeless people can gather. And eat.\n \n \"The government here doesn't care about anybody,\" said one homeless woman, Linda Norman, 55, taking a bottle of water and already perspiring in morning heat approaching 100 degrees at Huntridge Circle Park, a manicured, well-watered three-acre patch of green in a residential area near downtown. \"We just want to eat.\"\n \n Las Vegas officials said the ordinance was not aimed at casual handouts from good Samaritans. Instead, they said it would be enforced against people like Ms. Sacco, whose regular offerings, they said, have lured the homeless to parks and have led to complaints by residents about crime, public drunkenness and litter.\n \n \"Families are scared to go to the park,\" said Gary Reese, the mayor pro tem and a City Council member who represents the area around Huntridge Circle Park. The city, Mr. Reese added, had just spent $1.7 million in landscaping and other improvements there.\n \n \"I don't think anybody in America wants people to starve to death,\" Mr. Reese said. \"But if you want to help somebody, people can go to McDonald's or Kentucky Fried Chicken and give them a meal.\"\n \n He said that the police would ignore \"isolated cases\" of violating the ordinance, and predicted that the law would ultimately help the homeless because they would be forced to seek meals at soup kitchens run by social service organizations that could provide other assistance as well.\n \n But Maria Foscarinis, director of the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty in Washington, said the prohibition would do more harm than good. \"Nobody wants the poor and homeless living in public spaces,'' Ms. Foscarinis said, \"but this kind of response is terribly misguided.\" \n \n The American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada, which opposed the ordinance, said it was preparing a legal challenge. The group's general counsel, Allen Lichtenstein, called the measure absurd and said it was an unconstitutional infringement on free assembly and other rights. \n \n Mr. Lichtenstein accused Mayor Oscar B. Goodman, who supports the new restriction, of waging a campaign against homeless people, whom the mayor has openly criticized. At a June meeting of the City Council, Mr. Goodman suggested that panhandlers with signs asking for food be sued for \"false advertising\" because soup kitchens provide free meals. \"Some people say I'm the mean mayor,'' Mr. Goodman acknowledged, but he defended the ordinance as part of the effort to steer the homeless to social service groups, and said the city was taking part in a regional initiative to end homelessness in 10 years.\n \n The ordinance, an amendment to an existing parks statute approved by the Council on July 19, bans the \"the providing of food or meals to the indigent for free or for a nominal fee.\" It goes on to say that \"an indigent person is a person whom a reasonable ordinary person would believe to be entitled to apply for or receive\" public assistance. . . .",

   "A small number ? Once the parks become another a food serving center for them, do you honestly think the homeless will be in the parks in small numbers ? \n \n I have empathy for the homeless, it is one of our country's greatest shames. Our nation sends billions of dollars a year to third world countries, yet I pass homeless people with their stolen shopping carts filled with their ragged clothes and aluminum cans daily, on the street. They have always been a part of our nations society, and always will be. For a human being to not have the basic needs of a roof over their head and hot water for a bath is unthinkable to most. To these people it is a way of life for them. ...\n \n But one needs to look at the whole picture of what makes up the homeless populace in my country. The homeless population is not made up wholly of stock market players, that took a hit on the market and lost everything. We have mostly mentally incapacitated ( only the insured get to stay in the institutions, the uninsured get put on back on the streets) , substance abusers that have given up on living, and those that will not do any type of menial labor for food , but will take the good will freely of others. ...\n \n With my description of our homeless, would you take your two year old child and picnic with them at the park and not be ticked off from having to walk around the human feces in the grass, the vomit, the stench of a body that has not been bathed in a month ? Sounds like a terrible way to describe the life of a human being doesnt it ? But that is the way they live in my city. Shameful indeed, especially for the mentally handicapped. Those street people that started out in life with workable mental and physical capabilities made a choice in life. Those, I am not so emphatic to. If I had chosen not to get at least a basic education, chosen to do drugs or had become a drunk, not chosen to work my fingers so hard for the last forty years that I now have arthritic knots on them , then I could have been living out of a grocery cart too.",

The Gaon rose to leave the meeting. \"But Rabbi,\" said a Councilmember, \"we need your comment on this proposed new legislation!\"\n \n \"What new legislation?\" said the Gaon. \"This was already the law of Sodom, long ago!\" And he left.\n \n The proposal was dropped.\n \n",

   "which is obvious for anyone to see, the most obvious manifestation being in housing, where in almost every town and city you will get wealthier and poorer areas.\n\n \n Well that is down to ecconomics not class, obviously those with money will be able to afford better housing than the poor, that does not make them a higher class of people, it just makes them richer, that is not class, thats money, class is when one regards themselves superior to others because of the amount of money they have or the bloodline they were born into even if they have no money at all, that is class. Your talking about ecconomics not class.\n \n As for ecconomics I am also very left wing on that issue one would almost call me communist but obviously I am not I am infact totally against communism. You see I believe that all people should have the same wage as each other, a man with two cows should give a man with no cows, one of his cows, to destroy poverty one needs to destroy wealth.\n \n Although I am not a communist I hate Capitalisim much more\n \n Capitalism is much more dangerous than communism, because communism sets the state as supreme authority, all citizens work for the good of the state,and in turn the state takes care of its people, but of course the weakness of men means they usually fall into corruption but it is very much based on Christianity in that Christians work for the Good of Christ and the Church, only difference is no one forces non christians to work for the church or Christ, but each man is called by Christ to submit of his own free will, obviously men in the church fall into corruption too, but the church is also very liberal, it has confession and absolution.\n \n Capitalisim, now that is some scary stuff, it sets money as the supreme authority by its very nature it breeds greed and corruption not only within the leadership but also within the whole of society, those who hold the money hold the power and hord the money to themselves, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer eventually money means virtually nothing to the rich and those who are not super rich end up being nothing but slaves....so they invent a class system where the rich are the superior but an ordinary man can feel better about himself because although he is a slave, he can think himself better than another slave because he is paid more.\n \n IT IS CAPITALISM, NOT COMMUNISIM THAT SAYS WE SHOULD DESTROY OUR EXCESS FOOD INSTEAD OF GIVING IT TO THE STARVING",

In other words, they were not being charitable to the poor. This was the sin of S&G. Gaon basically pointed that out to them, that they were repeating the sin of S&G.\n \n Las Vegas is discouraging the poor from being in the parks by making it illegal to give them some of the basic nessesities (food). That is the sin of S&G.\n \n So, I was comparing Las Vegas to S&G... and the attitude of the lack of charity to the people who lived in S&G.",
