   "Jo Bennett has created/parroted an interesting argument in his push for pacifism. Does God or the Bible specifically forbid self-defense, or use of force to protect another?\n \n Personally I say that no such prohibition can be found within any version of the bible or God's teachings. But that's just me.\n \n Your thoughts?\n\n \n Jo Bennett is deluded, as usual.\n \n The Bible and self-defense\n \n By Joseph Farah\n \u00a9 2010 WorldNetDaily.com \n \n After my plea to Americans last week to buy firearms as a first step to fighting terrorism, a number of Christians wrote challenging my prescription as unbiblical, unscriptural and ungodly. \n \n Wrong. \n \n The Bible couldn't be clearer on the right - even the duty - we have as believers to self-defense. \n \n Let's start in the Old Testament. \n \n \"If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die, there shall no blood be shed for him,\" we are told in Exodus 22:2. The next verse says, \"If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be blood shed for him; for he should make full restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.\" \n \n In other words, it was perfectly OK to kill a thief breaking into your house. That's the ultimate expression of self-defense. It doesn't matter whether the thief is threatening your life or not. You have the right to protect your home, your family and your property, the Bible says. \n \n The Israelites were expected to have their own personal weapons. Every man would be summoned to arms when the nation confronted an enemy. They didn't send in the Marines. The people defended themselves. \n \n In 1 Samuel 25:13, we read: \"And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the stuff.\" \n \n Every man had a sword and every man picked it up when it was required. \n \n Judges 5:8 reminds us of what happens to a foolish nation that chooses to disarm: \"They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?\" \n \n The answer to the rhetorical question is clear: No. The people had rebelled against God and put away their weapons of self-defense. \n \n \"Blessed be the LORD my strength which teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight,\" David writes in Psalms 144:1. \n \n Clearly, this is not a pacifist God we serve. It's God who teaches our hands to war and our fingers to fight. Over and over again throughout the Old Testament, His people are commanded to fight with the best weapons available to them at that time. \n \n And what were those weapons? Swords. \n \n They didn't have firearms, but they had sidearms. In fact, in the New Testament, Jesus commanded His disciples to buy them and strap them on. Don't believe me? Check it out. \n \n Luke 22:36: \"Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.\" \n \n I know. I know. You biblically literate skeptics are going to cite Matthew 26:52-54 - how Jesus responded when Peter used his sword to cut off the ear of a servant of the high priest: \"Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels? But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?\" \n \n Read those verses in context and they support my position. Jesus told Peter he would be committing suicide to choose a fight in this situation - as well as undermining God's plan to allow Jesus' death on the cross and resurrection. \n \n Jesus told Peter to put his sword in its place - at his side. He didn't say throw it away. After all, He had just ordered the disciples to arm themselves. The reason for the arms was obviously to protect the lives of the disciples, not the life of the Son of God. What Jesus was saying was: \"Peter, this is not the right time for a fight.\" \n \n In the context of America's current battle - as we make plans to rebuild after the devastation of Sept. 11 and defend ourselves at the same time - we should recall Nehemiah, who rebuilt the walls of Jerusalem. \n \n \"They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with those that laded, every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon,\" we're told in Nehemiah 4:17-18. \"For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and so builded.\" \n \n The Bible and self-defense\n \n Love does not allow your family to be slaughtered.",

If someone takes your cloak, do not stop him from taking your tunic. 30Give to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what belongs to you, do not demand it back. 31Do to others as you would have them do to you.\n 21&#8220;You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, &#8216;Do not murder,a and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.&#8217; 22But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to his brother, &#8216;Raca,' is answerable to the Sanhedrin. But anyone who says, &#8216;You fool!&#8217; will be in danger of the fire of hell.\n 38\"You have heard that it was said, 'Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.'g 39But I tell you, Do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. 40And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. 41If someone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles. 42Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.\n 43\"You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' 44But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, 45that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. 46If you love those who love you, what reward will you get?

   "Actually, Isaiah 9:6 is referring to Hezekiah , not Jesus.That was one of Hezekiah's royal titles.\n\n \n Jewish interpreters such as Bar Kapparah write Hezekiah fell far short. ( See b. Sanhedrin 94a). \n \n Objections to Isaiah 7:14 and Isaiah 9:6-7\n \n Isaiah 9:6, 7 Cannot Be About Hezekiah \n \n Judaism claims that Isaiah 9:6 was written in order to encourage King Hezekiah, who at that time was being threatened by the powerful armies of Sennacherib, king of Assyria . During the reign of Hezekiah, the Assyrians came to destroy the cities of Judah and capture Jerusalem . It was a very bleak time because Assyria was a world empire. \n \n Because of the events recorded in the Bible, it is possible to determine Hezekiah&#8217;s age when this attack occurred. According to 2 Kings 18:1-2, Hezekiah was twenty-five years old when he began to reign. The Bible establishes that Sennacherib&#8217;s army attacked the cities of Judah during the fourteenth year of Hezekiah&#8217;s reign (2 Kings 18:13). Hezekiah was 39 years old (25+14) at the time, this took place: \n \n 2 Kings 18:1 \"Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign. (2) Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem . &#8230;\" \n \n 2 Kings 18:13 \"Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took them.\" \n \n Hezekiah was 39 years old during the Assyrian invasion. Could the phrase \"for unto us a child is born\" apply to a 39 year old man who was the king of Judah for 14 years? It is insulting to apply this verse to a 39-year-old king! The age factor alone eliminates Hezekiah as the subject of Isaiah 9:6,7. \n \n Additionally, Judaism claims that Isaiah wrote verse 7 to encourage Hezekiah that the throne of David would remain secure in the face of this Assyrian invasion, and that through Hezekiah, God would establish the throne of David for evermore. This cannot be the case. \n \n In Isaiah chapter 39, the LORD was furious with Hezekiah for being proud of the wealth of Judah and opening his palace to show all of its treasures to the pagan Babylonians. This is found in Isaiah 39:1-4. This pride infuriated the LORD God of Israel and resulted in Isaiah notifying Hezekiah of God&#8217;s severe punishment, a punishment that would fall on Hezekiah&#8217;s descendants: \n \n Isaiah 39:5 \"Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD of hosts: (6) Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the LORD. \n \n (7) And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon .\" \n \n The combinations of the curse on King Jeconiah&#8217;s seed, all of King Hezekiah&#8217;s descendant made eunuchs, and all of King Zedekiah&#8217;s sons killed at Riblah, the Hebrew Scriptures do not allow anyone to continue the throne of David through Hezekiah. Therefore, how can Isaiah 9:7 apply to Hezekiah? \n \n In summary, King Hezekiah&#8217;s line ended with a curse on King Jeconiah&#8217;s seed, with the death of all of King Zedekiah&#8217;s sons and whoever remained of Hezekiah&#8217;s seed was taken to Babylon and made a eunuch. The Bible is very clear that the kingly line of Hezekiah ended and did not remain forever as Isaiah 9:7 requires. \n \n Isaiah 9:7 also indicates that the subject of the passage would bring peace forever. With Hezekiah, this was certainly not the case. History records that after Hezekiah&#8217;s death, Israel was taken captive twice. The first was for seventy years by the king of Babylon and the second for almost 2000 years. Israel has experienced anything but peace up until this very moment in time. Quite obviously, Hezekiah did not establish peace forever. \n \n Isaiah 9:7 states that the subject of the verse would establish the earth \"with judgment and with justice from henceforth even forever.\" Hezekiah never accomplished this. This responsibility is set aside for the Messiah, the Branch, as Jeremiah 23:5 so clearly indicates: \n \n Jeremiah 23:5 \"Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.\" \n \n For all the reasons shown above Isaiah 9:6, 7 cannot be describing King Hezekiah. These verses are about King Messiah, God&#8217;s Righteous Servant. These verses are yet to be fulfilled. They will be fulfilled at the awesome Second Coming of the Lord Jesus, God&#8217;s Righteous Servant. \n \n Isaiah 9:6, 7 Cannot Be About Hezekiah",

As for your verse above it's really uncharcteristic of him so I would question that verse. Below is commentary\n \n Geneva Study Bible\n \n {m} Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.\n \n (m) He says all this using an allegory, as if he said, O my friends and fellow soldiers, you have lived until now in relative peace: but now there is at hand a most severe battle to be fought, and you must therefore lay all other things aside and think about dressing yourselves in armour. And what this armour is, is shown by his own example, when he prayed afterward in the garden and reproved Peter for striking with the sword.\n \n People's New Testament\n \n 22:36 But now. Now has come a time of trial when all will be against you.\n \n He that hath no sword, let him... buy one. Not to be taken literally, but a striking way of saying that enemies upon every side will assail them.\n \n Wesley's Notes\n \n 22:36 But now - You will be quite in another situation. You will want every thing. He that hath no sword, let him sell his garment and buy one - It is plain, this is not to be taken literally. It only means, This will be a time of extreme danger.\n \n Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary\n \n 22:21-38 How unbecoming is the worldly ambition of being the greatest, to the character of a follower of Jesus, who took upon him the form of a servant, and humbled himself to the death of the cross! In the way to eternal happiness, we must expect to be assaulted and sifted by Satan. If he cannot destroy, he will try to disgrace or distress us. Nothing more certainly forebodes a fall, in a professed follower of Christ, than self-confidence, with disregard to warnings, and contempt of danger. Unless we watch and pray always, we may be drawn in the course of the day into those sins which we were in the morning most resolved against. If believers were left to themselves, they would fall; but they are kept by the power of God, and the prayer of Christ. Our Lord gave notice of a very great change of circumstances now approaching. The disciples must not expect that their friends would be kind to them as they had been. Therefore, he that has a purse, let him take it, for he may need it. They must now expect that their enemies would be more fierce than they had been, and they would need weapons. At the time the apostles understood Christ to mean real weapons, but he spake only of the weapons of the spiritual warfare. The sword of the Spirit is the sword with which the disciples of Christ must furnish themselves.",

Why should the criminal -IE the wicked person- get more consideration for their well being, than the person they seek to victimize and exploit for their own gain?\n\n \n You should have asked a different question. If you want to stay on topic stop debating about what a person would do, the question was about the biblical basis for self defense. \n \n Most people will and have historically defended themselves with and without deadly force and done so on actual and/or perceived threat. So to the question not asked you have your answer, in that the majority of people the majority of times will defend themselves.\n \n As to the question actually asked, there isn't anything that specifically addresses it and while there are a few verses that could be viewed as supporting there are more that don't. If you look at the actions of Jesus and disciples in almost every single instance the actions taken are non-violent and passive even with occurrence of physical violence and/or impending death.\n \n Religion is not about you and your wants, needs and desires or at best those are secondary to those of God. Your here to please him and as long as it doesn't interfere with that finding happiness on your own time is OK. Now killing off God's glory givers interferes with his glory getting. That isn't good in the eyes of God. \n \n If you notice the Bible never explains how government is supposed to be. Merely that the people are to obey it. Which implies that we are to manage ourselves based on what we feel appropriate within certain boundaries given in the Bible. So the closest I think you will get is that if the government says it's OK and nothing biblically contradicts it your good to go in the eyes of God",
