   "The UK newspaper Daily Mirror published last week an article that can lace our boots on the true sources of ammo of Iraqi insurgents. It is said in the article, Czech-made rounds Sellier and Bellot can be freely bought at every illegal market in Iraq. \n But how did they get there? Daily Mirror writes that the ammo was resold to Iraqi arms dealers from Georgia where it had been delivered to from countries of Eastern Europe at the suggestion and under the auspices of Washington. \n I hope that this last wasn't in the plans of Washington when it decided to uphold Georgian armed forces with ammo from its European feudatories. \n Anyway, rounds meant for a protege of Washington are being sold to Iraq (I'm sure this being done not behind the back of Georgian authorities - especially president Saakashvili, Interior Minister and Defense Minister -these three being most suspicious characters) where America's worst enemies use them to ambush American patrol units, attack US bases and kidnap diplomatic missions from other states. \n Damn, how unwise it is! That's probably for the hundredth time since the start of Iraq operation that I find G. Bush and his team's mental abilities not to be corresponding their work status.",

   "As far as I know, eastern europe exists soley to provide weapons and ammo to the rest of the world, regardless of race, creed, or political beliefs. The only exception to this is Prague, which also supplies underage hookers, drugs, and a convenient meeting place to contract with mercenaries. Get blown by a 15 yr old, get high, hire and army, and equip them all in the same night. Bottom dollar, no questions asked. \n \n They do need to do something about the nightclubs, though. The last time I was there it was pretty apparent that the number of drunk and high American and Western European tourists wandering around was probably cutting down on the underaged hooker market. Why pay for it when you can nail some smashed British chick for free?\n \n Sellier and Bellot has never been particularly concerned with where their products end up.\n \n Realistically, Georgia is a poor little nothing country. I would just about bet that the rounds are being imported and paid for, then stolen and shipped back out. Maybe without ever actually leaving the ship.",
