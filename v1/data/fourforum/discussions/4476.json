Most university departments are now saturated with feminist studies, XXXXX theory, multicultural studies and other leftist pop ideology masquerading as intellectual theory.

   "The new straw man argument of the \"chosen lifestyle\" crew appears to be that unless it can be proven that homosexuality can be attributed to a single \"gay gene,\" it's not innate and therefore a voluntarily chosen preference that can be wilfully altered.\n \n Forget the fact that almost no researchers that have found evidence of a biological component to the orientation--and certainly none of the most recent ones--claim or personally believe there is a single gene responsible for homosexuality.

But whether refer to religious teachings or not, I was speaking only on reparative therapy as described in the article you linked: therapy which seeks to change someone's sexual orientation.\n \n \nA lot of these groups are not so much pushing the idea that one should \"change\" his or her orientation, but rather that it's not end of the world as we know it to actually think about the possibility of abiding by the religious absolute truth one might believe in and do what he or she thinks is right REGARDLESS of what always feels right.\n\n \n Sexual orientation is an interesting concept, in truth; scientifically it describes who you have a sexual attraction to, but this usually extends to who you fall in love with. Certainly it is not the end of the world to act against one's sexual orienation; if I were a homosexual with a moral view that homosexuality is wrong, then I would probably not engage in homosexuality. There should be nothing wrong with that; I am sure I would have a troubled life doing what I feel is immoral, though I am sure I would be equally troubled denying the one I love. Yet although I might choose to not engage in homosexuality in that situation, I would not deny others the right unless they were harming someone by doing it.\n \n \nIt's not a matter of changing one's orientation, but of not being a slave to it.\n \n And for that matter, the concept of orientation is overblown anyway--it simply means being oriented toward something. It's to the gay lobby's political advantage to push the idea that orientation is some impossible monster to overcome and that the only reasonable option is to accept their recommendations to be openly gay and proud about it. Despite the fact that numerous gay people say they live happy successful lives not being gay any more, you'll never hear that from the gay lobby. Instead people like Bennett are subject to character assasination and are vilified as \"doing it for the money.\"\n\n \n Certainly it is possible to not act on sexual attraction to someone of the same-sex, should you feel there a reason to not act on it, but to deny love is far more difficult.\n \n Gay rights activists do tend to put a lot of emphasis on homosexuality being natural and impossible to change, but they do this because they let opponents of gay rights control the argument when those opponents claim that if homosexuality can be changed, homosexuals do not deserve equal rights. It seems to me that most people here understand that whether homosexuality is a choice or not has no relevance to whether homosexuals deserve equal rights and benefits. As a free society, we don't deny people benefits because they choose to live one way instead of another.\n \n I don't doubt that Bennett is not doing it for the money. He is likely doing it because he feels it is a good thing to do, though in reality, I imagine he has hurt many people.\n \n \nIn reality they just see through the left's push toward \"diversity\" as the hypocrisy that it is.\n\n \n I'm not certain about that. Looking at the article linked to, it seems to me that the author is fighting diversity directly. He is supporting denial of gay rights based on the claim that people can change. He is rather directly claiming that we should not grant rights to gays because it is possible for them to conform, to live how we want them to live. He is claiming that we should only grant benefits for conformity. I must feel that such a direct attack on diversity shows that it is their opponents who are actually supporting diversity. So why do you think that the left does not support diversity?\n \n \nOnly an arrogant fool would make such a claim.\n\n \n Nah, well not exactly. Plenty of people have believe that religion holds absolute truth who have not been fools. And plenty have believed such who have not been arrogant. Although it may be an inaccurate or foolish claim to make, even the most intelligent and humble among us are wrong sometimes.",

The people who shell out big bucks for \"reparative therapy\" (their term, not ours) are highly motivated  to rid themselves of their same-sex desires.\n \n Yet even in the highly-touted (by anti-gay groups) Spitzer study, a pathetic few of these highly-motivated gays and bisexuals said they no longer felt same-sex attraction. They didn't even win over all the admitted bi-sexuals, for Chrissake! (Oh, yeah... that's  real proof of change, when you can't even get the bisexuals to quit feeling that way!)\n \n See here for a good impartial analysis: http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_spit.htm\n \n Look, right off the bat, the very existence of \"reparative therapy\" outfits knocks the \"chosen lifestyle\" claim into a cocked hat.

It is just my opinion on the origins of sexual orientation.\n \n The QueerByChoice members seem like a set of people that make for some interesting conversation in my mind. They believe that by psychologically manipulating themselves, they have been able to mold their sexual attraction to apply to members of the same sex. Some seem to believe that they can change to heterosexual, some do not. Some believe anyone can change, some do not. Some think that everyone is naturally bisexual. May apparently chose to be gay or bisexual because they believe that heterosexuality is unhealthy. All very interesting, and some of this reasoning goes along with the way that I think sexuality.\n \n Some of it seems to be completely illogical, for example one of their FAQ points suggests that if you have a positive relationship with someone with a green mohawk, you will become more sexually attracted to people with green mohawks. It also implies that as your partner grows older, you tend to find older people more attractive to compensate. Both of these are invalid statements in my opinion because they are not really changes in sexual attraction.\n \n My hypothesis about sexual orientation is that each person is naturally attracted to a set of physical attributes, personalities, and situations. The more this set of attractions can be associated to females, the more they tend to be attracted to females. The more it can be associated to males, the more they tend to be attracted to males. I believe that this set of attractions is similar to other preferences. Most people like sweet foods, but there are many exceptions. Most people probably hold a set of attractions more common in the opposite sex, but there are likely exceptions. \n \n Now this would imply that sexual orientation is hard-coded at birth, and I think birth genetics do have the most to do with it, though when one understands what his or her own set of attractions is, it may be possible to apply that set of attractions in a manner that had not originally been considered. This lack of consideration could be caused by ignorance or social pressures, or perhaps it requires a twist to one's attractions to notice it. Regardless, I would imagine that some, though probably not very many, people are able to expand their sexual attraction simply by changing the way they look at something.\n \n I think that closing a sexual attraction, however, is a very dangerous thing. This is because in order to do this, one would need to stop looking at things in a way he already knows is possible. The only way for an individual to do this would be to convince himself to ignore that which he or she currently understands as reality or to associate that understanding with something less pleasant, both of which are forced alterations of reality. This is why I feel that attempts to remove one's attraction to members of the same sex can be very harmful.\n \n None of this necessarily completely applies to sexual orientation, for even if one can change his or her sexual attractions, it is a very different thing to change one's desire to spend his or her life with a member of a certain gender. It seems very difficult to change that desire; to describe this, I should point to anyone who thinks they can choose to change his or her sexual orientation and ask that person why they do not. It is the desire to spend one's life with someone of a specific sex that stops those people from changing who they are sexually attracted to. Just as the QBC people might choose to be with a member of the same sex, unkerpaulie might choose to be with a member of the opposite sex. The origins of that desire are probably extremely complex.",

   "The QueerByChoice members seem like a set of people that make for some interesting conversation in my mind. They believe that by psychologically manipulating themselves, they have been able to mold their sexual attraction to apply to members of the same sex. Some seem to believe that they can change to heterosexual, some do not. Some believe anyone can change, some do not. Some think that everyone is naturally bisexual. May apparently chose to be gay or bisexual because they believe that heterosexuality is unhealthy. All very interesting, and some of this reasoning goes along with the way that I think sexuality.\n\n i would just interject by saying i think people that choose homosexuality or bisexuality because it is an exciting or interesting twist to \"common\" sex relations. bisexuality opens the door to lots of variety. from a strictly healthwise point of view, homosexuality/bisexuality is more risky than heterosexuality\n \n \nSome of it seems to be completely illogical, for example one of their FAQ points suggests that if you have a positive relationship with someone with a green mohawk, you will become more sexually attracted to people with green mohawks. It also implies that as your partner grows older, you tend to find older people more attractive to compensate. Both of these are invalid statements in my opinion because they are not really changes in sexual attraction.\n\n in a way, this is sexual preference. some men prefer thick women over skinny. some like short women, while others the sexual attraction isnt there. certain personality traits or physical features may turn off one particular guy and attract another, and vice versa in the opposite scenario. isnt this related to sexual preference?\n \n \nMy hypothesis about sexual orientation is that each person is naturally attracted to a set of physical attributes, personalities, and situations. The more this set of attractions can be associated to females, the more they tend to be attracted to females. The more it can be associated to males, the more they tend to be attracted to males. I believe that this set of attractions is similar to other preferences. Most people like sweet foods, but there are many exceptions. Most people probably hold a set of attractions more common in the opposite sex, but there are likely exceptions. \n\n i disagree. any \"natural attraction\" seems to be adaptable, and sometimes totally undetectable. some men can fantasize about virtually every woman they see. others are extremely picky, as though his \"right\" woman doesnt even exist. how can the \"natural attraction\" of people like tese be categorized?\n \n \nNow this would imply that sexual orientation is hard-coded at birth, and I think birth genetics do have the most to do with it, though when one understands what his or her own set of attractions is, it may be possible to apply that set of attractions in a manner that had not originally been considered. This lack of consideration could be caused by ignorance or social pressures, or perhaps it requires a twist to one's attractions to notice it. Regardless, I would imagine that some, though probably not very many, people are able to expand their sexual attraction simply by changing the way they look at something.\n\n then again, it could very well be that the attraction to certain qualities is acquired as the child learns and develops. everything a child experiences is absorbed, and decision making skills are encoded at a very early age. children develop likes and dislikes in infancy which sometimes turn around completely in adolecence\n \n \nI think that closing a sexual attraction, however, is a very dangerous thing. This is because in order to do this, one would need to stop looking at things in a way he already knows is possible. The only way for an individual to do this would be to convince himself to ignore that which he or she currently understands as reality or to associate that understanding with something less pleasant, both of which are forced alterations of reality. This is why I feel that attempts to remove one's attraction to members of the same sex can be very harmful.\n\n and what exactly is dangerous about looking at things in a different way from what is normal or familiar? something that is less pleasant or less comfortable is not necessariy less realistic. there are many people comfortably settled in beliefs about themselves and the world around them that is totally conflicting with reality. familiarity is acheived through repetition, not necessarily truth\n \n \nNone of this necessarily completely applies to sexual orientation, for even if one can change his or her sexual attractions, it is a very different thing to change one's desire to spend his or her life with a member of a certain gender. It seems very difficult to change that desire; to describe this, I should point to anyone who thinks they can choose to change his or her sexual orientation and ask that person why they do not.

Just as the QBC people might choose to be with a member of the same sex, unkerpaulie might choose to be with a member of the opposite sex. The origins of that desire are probably extremely complex.\n\n how is this different? what would prevent one from changing their mind about what gender they want to have sex with, and not what gender they want long term intamacy with?",

   "interesting, considering that joe said: \"Personally, after reading your posts I think you may be bisexual. I myself have never had fantasies about women, ever. I have been with women, and almost married, but I was sort of playing the part. You are actually having fantasies about both sexes.\"\n \n why is the fantasy any different from the sexual attraction? people on this very board have repeatedly stated that homosexuality is about the attraction, not the action. a fantasy is a mental manifestation of an attraction. you seem to think otherwise...\n\n \n True! Most mental health professionals will tell you that your sexual fantasies do have something to do with your attractions. If someone only has fantasies about one sex, it can be guessed that they are only attracted to that sex.",

   "Yeah, but that's less fun.\n\n let's make it more fun then. what exactly are the \"things about yourself and the way you think that cannot be changed\"?\n \n \nAlthough we cannot like or dislike anything without comparing it to something else, we are genetically bred to prefer some things over others. For example, it is the result of genetics, not the teachings of society or state of mind which causes us to prefer no pain over pain. It is the result of genetics which causes us to prefer sexual pleasure over no sexual pleasure. It is the result of genetics that someone has a learning disability. It is the result of genetics, I argue, that people think sugar tastes sweet and pizza tastes delicious. Although we may be able to overcome some of these natural preferences by psychologically altering our real perceptions of these things into something false, such is likely to be psychologically damaging.\n\n yes, we all dislike pain, although even this can and does change. would you say that masochism is also genetic? and yes, sugar is sweet, scented candles are relaxing, rhythmic music encourages movement, sex is pleasureable. all these things are common among us, but it has nothing to do with built-in preference, because all are susceptible to change. some people dislike any and all these things based entirely on psychological conditioning. in other words, their preferences were LEARNED\n \n \nSince one of the factors is the learned process of what is taboo and what is acceptable, it seems likely that two identical twins could have a different set of sexual attractions. Also, one twin may have taken the time to learn to apply his or her natural set of attractions to something that the other has not. Furthermore, if I am to merely hypothesize, diet, drugs, or intake of specific hormones may also affect sexual attraction.\n\n then what grounds do we have to assume that genetics play any role in sexual identity? if there was any genetic influence to begin with, it could have been completely overridden by psychological conditioning. therefore, whether the twins were both born with the \"gay gene\" or \"straight gene\", the presence of this genetic factor has absolutely no bearing whatsoever on the sexual identity of the individuals\n \n \nCertainly, or at least the underlying sexual preferences of that child. However there are enough aspects of sexual preferences that it should likely be very confusing to attempt to make such a detection. Such a determination would likely end up in attempting to combine a hundred different aspects of sexual preference in order to try to determine whether they best apply to males or females.\n\n apparently, these \"underlying preferences\" are of absolutely no effect, since the psychological conditioning of the individual overrides any other \"built-in\" trait factor. therefore these \"built-in\" trait factors are useless in practicality, because nothing about the individual's identity is influenced by them. so why should we even entertain the idea that they exist?",

I'm sure every parent would love to raise their child to feel that vegetables are sweet and delicious, but they simply are not able to overcome the built in preferences. This certainly doesn't mean that enough psychological manipulation couldn't cause a person to believe that candy tastes bitter, but that would have to occur through what is likely a very harmful and difficult psychological sensitization process or through hypnotism and suggestion. Both of those processes cause an individual to ignore or distort reality.\n \n It may be possible for an individual to change sexual orientation without such harm if that person holds an attraction to a set of traits that can be applied to both genders, albiet perhaps not equally. But for most, I would imagine that this cannot be done without strong psychological manipulation. This manipulation would be on an equivalent level to training someone to think that feces smells nice or pain is better than no pain. There is no way an individual can teach these things to himself, nor is there any way for society to teach them.\n \n As for masochism, I'd say it's genetic. It isn't that the individual likes to be in pain; it is that the individual is sexually attracted to the situation in which he is being put in pain by another.\n \n \nthen what grounds do we have to assume that genetics play any role in sexual identity? if there was any genetic influence to begin with, it could have been completely overridden by psychological conditioning. therefore, whether the twins were both born with the \"gay gene\" or \"straight gene\", the presence of this genetic factor has absolutely no bearing whatsoever on the sexual identity of the individuals\n\n \n I don't believe that society is likely to cause immense psychological manipulation; it is more likely to merely instate a particular taboo on a certain attraction.

Furthermore, when an individual realizes his natural attractions, it is very difficult for society or even for the individual himself to create taboos against those attractions. If a society creates taboos against the most important sexual attractions to an individual, that individual is probably more likely to ignore those taboos. Even though psychological factors can affect the sexual attractions of an individual, I would say they usually do not.

   "no psychological conditioning can convince anyone that sugar tastes bitter. sugar tastes sweet, and nothing can change that. our like or dislike of sugar is the behavior.\n \n now i agree that there are default behaviors and reflexes that we are born with. we would reflexively spew out a sour substance from our mouths because the body automatically associates this taste with something corrosive. its a mechanism that protects us and helps us to survive. other behaviors such as shyness, tantrums, thumb-sucking, etc, can be considered default behaviors. they also help us as infants/toddlers to survive. however, in almost all these instances, our \"built-in\" behaviors must be \"unlearned\", and replacement behaviors are adopted. therefore, we reinforce our child's habit of being polite rather than kicking in fits of rage. we reinforce our child's resistance to thumb-sucking. we reinforce (sometimes) or child's curiosity. sometimes other behaviors are learned at this period, such as being destructive or persistent. as parents, we fine tune our child's set of behaviors to suit us as best as we can. there is nothing damaging about this. in fact, left to the default behaviors, a child will much more likely be a social failure.\n\n \n I think that a big difference here is that I do not consider sexual attraction a behavior at all; I consider it a preference or sensation, and that is far different from a behavior. Take the example of a sour substance. Many people are born with the sensation, the preference that sour materials taste bad. They cannot change this. The behavior associated with this sensation is spewing the material out of your mouth. The preference is natural, is present on birth; the behavior could be changed. Shyness, tantrums, and thumb-sucking are all behaviors, not preferences, so it is no surprise that they can be unlearned. But if you think your thumb tastes good, yet you break the behavior of thumb-sucking, you will still think that your thumb tastes good even though you do not engage in the behavior of thumb-sucking.\n \n When considering sugar, it either tastes good or tastes bad. Although these preferences may change over time, it is not a psychological change which causes this. Like or dislike of sugar is not a behavior, it is a preference, a sensation. Although one can change his behavior so that he does not eat sugar, it is far more difficult to change one's preferences. As I had stated before, it is very difficult for someone to change his preferences so that he likes vegetables and healthy food as much as he likes unhealthy foods. We are born with a preference for unhealthy food. If anything, society teaches us to scorn and hate unhealthy food, yet it is still incredibly popular because it simply tastes good; it appeals to the natural preferences of people which they cannot change.\n \n \nwhether these behaviors are genetic or not has no bearing, because they are always reprogrammed out of the child's personality\n\n \n Yes, behaviors can be reprogrammed, and you did speak of behaviors, but sexual attraction cannot be considered a behavior. Acting on one's sexual attraction is a different story. Certainly one can learn not to act on his or her preferences, yet those preferences remain.\n \n \ni dont know about your application of the term \"psycological manipulation\", but society in most cases has everything to do with what habits we should teach and which we should discourage. society will severely reprimand someone that adhered to his \"natural behavior\" of defecating in his underwear, for example. so we train our children to use the bathroom. its almost always about society and whats \"acceptable behavior\"\n\n \n Certainly society teaches us important behaviors. But society has a far more difficult time changing our preferences. Society may institute taboos on our preferences; these taboos can cause us to deny that we hold a certain preference, to deny that we like a certain thing because liking that is taboo in this society. But that does not change the fact that we hold that we naturally hold that preference, and once we realize that we hold it, it would take drastic psychological manipulation to remove it. It is the equivalent of teaching someone that vegetables taste better than ice cream, and I don't feel it can be done without a form of psychological sensitization or hypnotism/suggestion.\n \n \nof course they would. and we'd all be the equivalent of aging babies. civilization probably wouldnt get too far\n \n consider certain species of animals, like lions, that are taught to hunt steathily by mimicing their parents and practicing on smaller animals/insects. the default habit of a young lion cub would be to wander around looking for food. yes he would be born with retractable claws, and reflexes to help him survive, but many of the behaviors must be taught\n\n \n This is again speaking specifically of behaviors, not preferences. When talking about sexual orientation, I feel that most people are talking about sexual attraction, which is the measure of sexual arousal an individual's body produces when a specific feature, behavior, or situation is encountered. It is a preference, not a behavior; although a straight man may choose to engage in homosexual activities, it is unlikely that such a man would be able to change his preference toward females.",

Well, I guess I did say that it can change over time, though that would refer back up to the genetic reasons for change in preferences over time, such as change in hormone production as a person matures. Preferences can certainly change over time; I don't think anyone would doubt that, but I do think that individuals are not able to choose to change their preferences nor do I think society can really change a person's underlying preferences.\n \n \nthumb-sucking is not about how the finger tastes. its about the sense of comfort the child gets from sucking on something. the first thing a child suckles is a nipple, and the satisfication he gets from that suck seems to last beyond him staisfying his hunger. thats why children will suck they thumb or pacifier when they are not even hungry.\n \n would you consider the satisfaction a child gets from sucking on a soft nipple-like object as a preference? is this something children are born with?\n\n \n It is certainly a preference, though one that likely changes as the child gets older, not because the child is somehow taught not to suck on nipples but because the genetics of that child have stopped the preference.\n \n \nlets say we discover a small child (say 6 years old) with an expressed preference for picking his nose and eating his boogers. there is obviously nothing \"wrong\" with this preference, except that it is widely unacceptable in society. is it possible to cause this child to change this preference without hypnosis or psycological manipulation?\n\n \n No, however such a preference would likely conflict with the more dominant preference of being accepted by one's immediate peers, and when a child realizes that he is not accepted by his peers when performing such an action, he would likely stop the action. Such is how society is able to place taboos upon certain preferences. It may also be that the individual learns not to spread germs or engage in activities which disgust others because of a desire to treat others well. Whether such a desire is learned or not is a matter of debate, I'm sure.\n \n \nand what if he does change his preference. it may be statistically unlikely, but not impossible, is it?\n\n \n I don't think individuals can just decide to hold a different preference. Although preferences may change over time, I think the standard preference change you are referring to is a matter of looking at one's underlying preferences in a different fashion. Using sexual orientation as an example, if one figures out a way to apply his or her sexual attractions to members of the same sex, he or she may be able to become bisexual. It should be far more difficult for an individual to cut off attractions to the sex he or she was initially attracted to, and it would probably require that individual to ignore real sexual attraction or associate that sex with something sexually unpleasant, both of which are forms of psychological manipulation.",

In 1998, Bad Subjects founded a small educational nonprofit corporation, also called Bad Subjects, which promotes the progressive use of new media and print publications. Donations to the nonprofit go toward funding printed copies of the magazine Bad Subjects (distributed for free), and other related projects, such as Bad Subjects books. Bad Subjects seeks to revitalize progressive politics in retreat. We think too many people on the left have taken their convictions for granted. So we challenge progressive dogma  by encouraging readers to think about the political dimension to all aspects of everyday life. We also seek to broaden the audience for leftist and progressive writing, through a commitment to accessibility and contemporary relevance.\n Bad Subjects was founded in September 1992, at UC Berkeley. Since then it has circulated widely, and today we actually have about 120,000 readers from around the world per month. You can use our online facilities to find articles on any topic, or browse our current or recent issues.\n Feel free to join in!

Hmm, I suppose one might have a natural preference toward a specific type of food which he has never tasted and therefore is not aware he holds a preference toward.\n \n The difference between a natual preference and a behavioral preference should be that natural preferences are created by the body. The underlying specifics of what an individual thinks tastes good and that which he thinks tastes bad cannot be changed by mere will alone. I feel you would be very hard-pressed to change your taste to prefer dirty rocks over pizza, for example. Only incredible psychological manipulation could cause this; your body naturally doesn't like the taste of dirty rocks. In the same fashion, an individual cannot control that which his body causes him to be sexually attracted to. Again, you cannot change yourself to be sexually aroused by a dirty rock.\n \n That being said, it may be possible for some people to manage to teach themselves to be of a different orientation. Just as an individual might not realize that he enjoys the taste of a food he has never eaten, an individual might not realize that he is sexually attracted to something, and it might even require a little innovation. \n \n To create a simple example, an individual might have a natural sexual attraction to thin people with no facial hair or body hair. This person might initially attribute those things to females, but through greater understanding of his or her sexual orientation, learn that these things can also apply to males. Upon realizing this, that person might also realize a set of additional, less prominant attractions to males specifically, and that person may therefore change his or her sexual orientation accordingly. Yet this does not mean that an individual could not have a set of attractions that simply do not apply to males or do not apply to females. I think that most people will tell you that they are simply not attracted to the features of one particular sex, and I don't think there is reason to believe that all of them can change, even though some may be able to.\n \n \n2 conflicting prefernces cannot exist at the same time. you can get up early, or you can rest longer, but you can only prefer one. you also mentioned that you feel there is a possibility that our jogger thinks it is more important to look more sexually attractive. this is a decision based motive, and the jogger's value system is at work here.\n\n \n Certainly two conflicting prefrences can exist. One might have a preference both to live and a preference toward eating unhealthy foods. The individual begins his life eating unhealthy foods, but when he begins to understand that this will not cause him to live, he realizes that the two natural preferences are conflicting, and he chooses the one more important. Although the individual still prefers the taste of unhealthy food, he may stop eating that in favor of the preference toward life over death.\n \n As for our jogger, certainly his decisions play a part in the process. I do not doubt that. It is true that society teaches the individual which decisions to make, but his decisions are based on what he learns is best condusive toward reaching his natural desire. His decisions do not change his natural desire. An individual is not taught that candy tastes good or that sex feels good, an individual is taught how to obtain the candy and how to obtain the sex, both of which are his natural desires.\n \n \nbut even IF your theory is right, and there are varioius conflicting preferences existing within our jogger, the preference that our jogger submits to is based on his choice. ultimately, choice is what overrules\n\n \n Choice does not determine natural preferences, but choice can overrule natural preferences when it comes to behavior. However, individual's choice is generally not arbitrary, it is generally fueled by his natural desires. Certainly an individual can choose not to engage in homosexuality even though he has natural attractions toward members of the same sex. Though an individual usually does that based on the desire to satisfy some different natural desire, such as social acceptance, or positive self-image. The individual's choice cannot change his natural desires, though it can cause his behavior to go against those desires.\n \n \nagain, sexual attraction, like any other preference, is evidenced in behavior, even if that behavior is merely the undetectable thoughts of sexual arousal or fantasizing. and like other preferences that are manifested by behavior, some are clearly changeable. the fact that preferences are changeable, and that corresponding behavior is also changeable (not to mention the testimony of some gays that homosexuality is changeable), supports the idea that people can and do learn their preferences, along with the other aspects that make up their identity\n\n \n Behavioral preferences are changable; natural preferences are not. If someone thinks that crying is the best way to obtain candy, that person may cry. But if you show that person that taking candy from the bin is the best way to obtain candy, that person may instead prefer the behavior of taking the candy himself. But the natural preference to taste candy remains the same.\n \n Again, it should not be surprising that some people feel they have chosen to be gay or straight, but I would be very surprised if most people could choose to be gay or straight.",

   "Are there any natural preferences which don't manifest in some sort of behavior? Hmm, I suppose one might have a natural preference toward a specific type of food which he has never tasted and therefore is not aware he holds a preference toward.\n\n 2 problems. firsty, since this preference is completely undetectable, both internally and externally, we have no case to suppose that such a preference exists. second, once the specific type of food is tasted, and your like for it is manifested, it becomes behavioral and we're back to square one\n \n it can be probably more logical to assume that a preference for tis type of food cannot be manifested because you have no KNOWLEDGE of that food. once you gain knowledge about how the food tastes, only then can any preference about it be established\n \n \nThe difference between a natual preference and a behavioral preference should be that natural preferences are created by the body. The underlying specifics of what an individual thinks tastes good and that which he thinks tastes bad cannot be changed by mere will alone. I feel you would be very hard-pressed to change your taste to prefer dirty rocks over pizza, for example. Only incredible psychological manipulation could cause this; your body naturally doesn't like the taste of dirty rocks. In the same fashion, an individual cannot control that which his body causes him to be sexually attracted to. Again, you cannot change yourself to be sexually aroused by a dirty rock.\n\n probably even more logical is the notion that based on our knowledge about how dirty rocks taste (or feel sexually), we decide that we will not develop a habit of eating (or having sex with) rocks. in that case it would still be a choice based preference\n \n \nThat being said, it may be possible for some people to manage to teach themselves to be of a different orientation. Just as an individual might not realize that he enjoys the taste of a food he has never eaten, an individual might not realize that he is sexually attracted to something, and it might even require a little innovation. \n\n again, this complicates the differentiation between the preferences created \"in the body\", since it can be argued that any taste acquired is generated internally\n \n \nTo create a simple example, an individual might have a natural sexual attraction to thin people with no facial hair or body hair.

I think that most people will tell you that they are simply not attracted to the features of one particular sex, and I don't think there is reason to believe that all of them can change, even though some may be able to.\n\n this \"underlying preference\" can never be detected then. it is hardly logical to assume that it even exists. a person in this scenario that went from being hetero to homo is merely looking for any common denominator and claiming that to be his \"natural preference\". this is so subjective i cant think of a single practical use for this idea. you could virtually come up with any justification for a preference change. wht makes it useless is that it can only be \"determined\" after the fact. if such natural preferences existed, i should be determinable even before a major preference change occurs.\n \n \nCertainly two conflicting prefrences can exist. One might have a preference both to live and a preference toward eating unhealthy foods. The individual begins his life eating unhealthy foods, but when he begins to understand that this will not cause him to live, he realizes that the two natural preferences are conflicting, and he chooses the one more important. Although the individual still prefers the taste of unhealthy food, he may stop eating that in favor of the preference toward life over death.\n\n then there is a prefernce conflict. only one can be prefered. obviously, prefernces can change. its like a to-do list. if they are listed by priority,m only one can be the most important at any time. yes, you can rearrange your priorities as the situation changes, but only one can be the most important. and even the order of your priorities are based on your knowledge of what is taking place, and your decsion about what is important based on your internal value system. this is all choice based\n \n \nAs for our jogger, certainly his decisions play a part in the process. I do not doubt that. It is true that society teaches the individual which decisions to make, but his decisions are based on what he learns is best condusive toward reaching his natural desire. His decisions do not change his natural desire. An individual is not taught that candy tastes good or that sex feels good, an individual is taught how to obtain the candy and how to obtain the sex, both of which are his natural desires.\n\n i disagree. the jogger's natural desire, if it even exists, would be independent of society's influence. the jogger's physical appearance only is relevant based on social standards, otherwise he'd rest as long as he could. therefore there would be no \"natural desire\" to look physically attractive. this desire is purely society-driven\n \n \nChoice does not determine natural preferences, but choice can overrule natural preferences when it comes to behavior. However, individual's choice is generally not arbitrary, it is generally fueled by his natural desires. Certainly an individual can choose not to engage in homosexuality even though he has natural attractions toward members of the same sex. Though an individual usually does that based on the desire to satisfy some different natural desire, such as social acceptance, or positive self-image. The individual's choice cannot change his natural desires, though it can cause his behavior to go against those desires.\n\n my view is that an individual's choices are fuelled by his internal value system, which accumulates throughout his lifetime based on his experiences. this value system, while very deep-rooted mentally, is subject to change through learning and conviction. decisions based on these convictions can form habits, which can develop into overriding preferences. you dont not object to the idea that decision based preferences can and do override whatever may be considered \"natural\", but now the problem is, how do we determine which preferences are natural and which are decision based (i will provide some links about some studies done pertaining to knowledge, neural paths and how they influence decisions)\n \n \nBehavioral preferences are changable; natural preferences are not.

But if you show that person that taking candy from the bin is the best way to obtain candy, that person may instead prefer the behavior of taking the candy himself.

   "Transcript of an excellent talk on \"reparative therapy\":\n http://www.mlp.org/resources/evanstalk.html\n \nPersonally I think another study done by Lee Beckstead, also reported in the book Sexual Conversion Therapy, is even more evidential than Shidlo and Schroeder's research. Beckstead interviewed 50 members of the Mormon Church in Utah who had been through conversion therapy, 30 who saw themselves as failures and 20 who claimed to have changed sexual orientation. Now gay and lesbian Mormons have even more motivation to change than do fundamentalist Protestants. Even the strictest Protestant theology normally says that a celibate and repentant gay or lesbian can be saved, and once we get to heaven we're all equal. In Mormon theology, we aren't all equal in heaven. Only heterosexually married parents receive \"everlasting joy\" and \"exaltation to Godhood.\" So I'm not surprised Beckstead found 20 Mormons who said they had changed from homosexual to heterosexual. Beckstead's data on these people was much more extensive than Schroeder and Shidlo's. He had individual interviews, journal writings, and focus group discussion data on each. These 20 people had been through typical cognitive reframing sorts of reparative therapy, where they were taught to identify same-sex attractions as indicating non-sexual needs. Many reported feeling more peace, contentment, and self-acceptance. However, Beckstead himself places in italics the following statement: No substantial or generalized heterosexual arousal was reported, and participants were not able to modify their tendency to be attracted to the same sex. Yet, these same participants continued to identify as heterosexual.\" I don't think we have a better statement of what reparative therapy does: it changes your cognitive interpretations, identity, and behavior, but not your sexual orientation. \n",

   "2 problems. firsty, since this preference is completely undetectable, both internally and externally, we have no case to suppose that such a preference exists. second, once the specific type of food is tasted, and your like for it is manifested, it becomes behavioral and we're back to square one\n\n \n Natural preferences are certainly not undetectable, we can see behavioral patterns revolve around them. Some people have a preference toward a particular type of food, so they organize their behavior in a fashion that helps them get that food. Others from exactly the same society and culture have preferences toward a completely different food, so they organize their behavior in a fashion that helps them get that food. We are unable to teach an individual that a specific food does not taste good.\n \n Once the food I spoke of is tasted, the preference does not become behavioral; the preference is still natural. However, the individual will try to learn how to obtain more of this food, and the chosen method of obtaining it is the behavioral preference.\n \n \nit can be probably more logical to assume that a preference for tis type of food cannot be manifested because you have no KNOWLEDGE of that food. once you gain knowledge about how the food tastes, only then can any preference about it be established\n\n \n Although a behavioral preference cannot be manifested, and the individual may have no knowledge of the natural preference, the natural preference still exists. If you have never tasted orange juice, and someone asks whether you like orange juice, you do not respond with \"no\", you respond with \"I don't know yet.\" Whether you like or dislike it does not depend on the way the question was phrased to you or what has been taught to you, it depends on your natural preference.\n \n \nprobably even more logical is the notion that based on our knowledge about how dirty rocks taste (or feel sexually), we decide that we will not develop a habit of eating (or having sex with) rocks. in that case it would still be a choice based preference\n\n \n You are right about tasting rocks, but our knowledge about how dirty rocks taste is only obtained by tasting a dirty rock, and when we taste that rock, we realize how naturally appealing it is to us. One could say that society tells us we don't eat rocks, so we learn that they taste bad, but society also tells us not to eat unhealthy foods, yet we love them.\n \n As sexual appeal, well you're right, we decide that a rock does not look or feel good sexually, so we are not attracted to it. But how do we know that it does not look good? It isn't that we were taught it; it is natural our ability to apply our natural sexual attractions to the rock.\n \n \nagain, this complicates the differentiation between the preferences created \"in the body\", since it can be argued that any taste acquired is generated internally\n\n \n I'm not certain what you mean here; though it is certainly a more complex view of preferences that I am presenting, yes.\n \n \nthis \"underlying preference\" can never be detected then. it is hardly logical to assume that it even exists. a person in this scenario that went from being hetero to homo is merely looking for any common denominator and claiming that to be his \"natural preference\". this is so subjective i cant think of a single practical use for this idea. you could virtually come up with any justification for a preference change. wht makes it useless is that it can only be \"determined\" after the fact. if such natural preferences existed, i should be determinable even before a major preference change occurs.\n\n \n What makes you think that these preferences are not determinable before a preference change? I would be very willing to bet that these natural preferences could be listed. Ask a straight person what he is attracted to about females, he'll list out body parts and features. Show a picture of a woman's chest, the curves of her body, and some men will find these things sexually attractive. Show a man a picture of a hairy woman and a hairless woman, and see which one he considers attractive. Watch whether a man hits on thin or heavyset women. The natural attractions of an individual should be very determinable. Consider even your own sexual attractions.\n \n \nthen there is a prefernce conflict. only one can be prefered. obviously, prefernces can change. its like a to-do list. if they are listed by priority,m only one can be the most important at any time. yes, you can rearrange your priorities as the situation changes, but only one can be the most important. and even the order of your priorities are based on your knowledge of what is taking place, and your decsion about what is important based on your internal value system. this is all choice based\n\n \n Sure, even preferences have an order of preference. The order of this preference can certainly change based on your value system, but your value system is determined by how someone has taught you to best achieve your natural preferences. If this seems circular, it certainly is; an individual is only able to rearrange his natural preferences when he is taught the cost of achieving those preferences.\n \n \ni disagree. the jogger's natural desire, if it even exists, would be independent of society's influence. the jogger's physical appearance only is relevant based on social standards, otherwise he'd rest as long as he could. therefore there would be no \"natural desire\" to look physically attractive. this desire is purely society-driven\n\n \n But the jogger's natural desire is certainly not to look physically attractive, it is to be appealing to the opposite sex, or to have a positive self-image, or to live a long, productive life, or maybe even to look attractive to himself. Looking in a specific fashion is only important because it helps him satisfy a natural desire.\n \n \nmy view is that an individual's choices are fuelled by his internal value system, which accumulates throughout his lifetime based on his experiences. this value system, while very deep-rooted mentally, is subject to change through learning and conviction. decisions based on these convictions can form habits, which can develop into overriding preferences. you dont not object to the idea that decision based preferences can and do override whatever may be considered \"natural\", but now the problem is, how do we determine which preferences are natural and which are decision based (i will provide some links about some studies done pertaining to knowledge, neural paths and how they influence decisions)\n\n \n I agree that this value system exists, yet I feel that it is determined for each individual uniquely, and it depends wholly on how that individual believes he or she can best accomplish his or her natural desires. As for which desires are natural, well that is a good quesiton. Stimulation which results in an uncontrollable sensation, such as a pleasurable taste or sexual arousal, seem to me most likely stimulating natural desires. Yet what about something like doing good unto others; is that a natural desire, or is it based on what may be a desire for a positive self-image, or a desire to be socially accepted?\n \n \nwhat is that person's natural preference to obtaining the candy?\n\n \n That is not a natural preference. The individual must learn how to obtain candy, and as he or she does, what appears to be the most effective and least costly method becomes the preferred way of satisfying that natural desire.\n \n \nif some people claim that they can and do choose to be gay, and some people claim that they cannot choose to be gay, how do we conclude that sexuality is a natural preference?\n\n \n The hypothesis is that sexual attraction is a natural desire which varies for everyone. While some may have natural desires for individuals of both sexes, they may move those natural desires up or down in priority based on the most effective method of achieving other natural desires. To test this, we could examine test the individual attractions of an unbiased individual, to try to determine which sexual features the individual is attracted to. We could also look for individuals with sexual attractions that would not have been taught by society. It may also be possible to study isolated individuals to see whether they hold a set of common attactions. If they do, it would be unlikely that these attractions are learned or taught by society.",

   "Natural preferences are certainly not undetectable, we can see behavioral patterns revolve around them. Some people have a preference toward a particular type of food, so they organize their behavior in a fashion that helps them get that food. Others from exactly the same society and culture have preferences toward a completely different food, so they organize their behavior in a fashion that helps them get that food. We are unable to teach an individual that a specific food does not taste good.\n \n Once the food I spoke of is tasted, the preference does not become behavioral; the preference is still natural. However, the individual will try to learn how to obtain more of this food, and the chosen method of obtaining it is the behavioral preference.\n\n this would mean that all preferences have behavioral manifestations. it would be impossible to detect a preference about a thing if that thing is never experienced. since all preferences are behavioral (ie., they have an associated behavior) how do we distinguish \"behavioral\" preferences from \"natural\" ones? are all preferences natural?\n \n \nAlthough a behavioral preference cannot be manifested, and the individual may have no knowledge of the natural preference, the natural preference still exists. If you have never tasted orange juice, and someone asks whether you like orange juice, you do not respond with \"no\", you respond with \"I don't know yet.\" Whether you like or dislike it does not depend on the way the question was phrased to you or what has been taught to you, it depends on your natural preference.\n\n the response \"i dont know\" tells us nothing about any \"natural\" preference the individual would have to orange juice. therefore it remains undetectable until orange juice is experience and a reaction occurs. there is absolutely no way of gaining any information about any underlying preference about orange juice, since the preference is only realized at the time the orange juice is experienced, and even this can change as well. the initial reaction of orange juice may be very different from the reaction after the person has tried orange juice several times\n \n \nYou are right about tasting rocks, but our knowledge about how dirty rocks taste is only obtained by tasting a dirty rock, and when we taste that rock, we realize how naturally appealing it is to us. One could say that society tells us we don't eat rocks, so we learn that they taste bad, but society also tells us not to eat unhealthy foods, yet we love them.\n\n its the opposite way around. rocks taste bad, have no nutritional value, and could seriously mess up your internal organs if eaten. as a survival mechanism, we dont eat rocks. this is a function of our bodies, not a preference\n \n \nAs sexual appeal, well you're right, we decide that a rock does not look or feel good sexually, so we are not attracted to it. But how do we know that it does not look good? It isn't that we were taught it; it is natural our ability to apply our natural sexual attractions to the rock.\n \n What makes you think that these preferences are not determinable before a preference change? I would be very willing to bet that these natural preferences could be listed. Ask a straight person what he is attracted to about females, he'll list out body parts and features. Show a picture of a woman's chest, the curves of her body, and some men will find these things sexually attractive. Show a man a picture of a hairy woman and a hairless woman, and see which one he considers attractive. Watch whether a man hits on thin or heavyset women. The natural attractions of an individual should be very determinable. Consider even your own sexual attractions.\n\n as far as sexual preference, a person can only list based on his current knowledge. if you ask a youth from india who has never encountered hispanic women if he has a preference about them, he'd say \"i dont know\". it would be impossible for him to determine his preference about anything he has no knowledge of.\n \n \nSure, even preferences have an order of preference. The order of this preference can certainly change based on your value system, but your value system is determined by how someone has taught you to best achieve your natural preferences. If this seems circular, it certainly is; an individual is only able to rearrange his natural preferences when he is taught the cost of achieving those preferences.\n\n my point is, only one can be the preference. \n \n \nBut the jogger's natural desire is certainly not to look physically attractive, it is to be appealing to the opposite sex, or to have a positive self-image, or to live a long, productive life, or maybe even to look attractive to himself. Looking in a specific fashion is only important because it helps him satisfy a natural desire.\n\n things like self-image and visual appeal cannot exist without a society to compare with. you cannot feel superior or inferior without a comparison of others. since these things are dependent on society, how can they be considered as inherently \"natural\"?\n \n \nI agree that this value system exists, yet I feel that it is determined for each individual uniquely, and it depends wholly on how that individual believes he or she can best accomplish his or her natural desires. As for which desires are natural, well that is a good quesiton. Stimulation which results in an uncontrollable sensation, such as a pleasurable taste or sexual arousal, seem to me most likely stimulating natural desires. Yet what about something like doing good unto others; is that a natural desire, or is it based on what may be a desire for a positive self-image, or a desire to be socially accepted?\n\n all this is decision based. i'll go into the difference between taste and preference in the next post, since they are not equivalent.\n \n \nThat is not a natural preference. The individual must learn how to obtain candy, and as he or she does, what appears to be the most effective and least costly method becomes the preferred way of satisfying that natural desire.\n\n can an individual have a preference about their method of obtaining the candy?\n \n \nThe hypothesis is that sexual attraction is a natural desire which varies for everyone. While some may have natural desires for individuals of both sexes, they may move those natural desires up or down in priority based on the most effective method of achieving other natural desires. To test this, we could examine test the individual attractions of an unbiased individual, to try to determine which sexual features the individual is attracted to. We could also look for individuals with sexual attractions that would not have been taught by society. It may also be possible to study isolated individuals to see whether they hold a set of common attactions. If they do, it would be unlikely that these attractions are learned or taught by society.\n\n im not saying that sexual orientation (or any preference) is taught by society. society sets what are the statistical norms. as individuals, we can decide if conforming to the norm is best for us or not. in any event, sexual preference apparently can and does change. it still boils down to one group saying they can change their sexual orientation, and one group saying they cannot. we cannot make any conclusion about how possible a sexuality switch is based on these claims alone",

   "jaxian, you made a good point about taste that i didnt really consider as i should. we naturally like sweet things. we naturally like sexual pleasure. we naturally dislike pain. these are what can be considered default preferences. you can also call them instincts\n\n \n Instincts, natural preferences... Yes, I think those can be considered the same thing.\n \n \nbut these instincts directly corelate to our survival. we naturally prefer sweet foods because our body recognizes sweet as nutritional (carbs and sugars). we dislike pain because our body recognizes it as something that could damage or kill us. orgasms in men marks the release of sperm, and sex is pleasureable up to that point probably to ensure that coitus continues until the sperm is released. all these default preferences are linked to survival\n\n \n Ah, but instincts do not necessarily correlate to our survival for a variety of reasons, all revolving around the idea that we are not built to survive individually, we are built to survive as a species. For example, each individual is not built with exactly the same natural preferences, even though there is likely one most suitable to survival. The reason for this is that variety helps us adapt as a species and allows us to survive in changing environments. So one individual may have an instinct which is not designed for survival, for we are built in a fashion that allows us to have a wide variety of traits. Furthermore, that which benefits our own survival might be different from that which is benefits the survival of the species as a whole. Sexual orientation, a rather relevant example, might allow for male-male or female-female child-raising families to arise in populations where there is an unbalanced number of males and females available to raise children.\n \n \nhowever, preferences can change. lets take the masochist as an example. being pricked with pins is painful. the body's reflex is to pull away from the source of pain. however, the masochist can overcome this reflex to the point where he doesnt even flinch. its not that the pin is less painful, its just that his reaction can change from that of repulsion to welcome. he feels pleasure, but the pain still exists. a preference for pain as sexual foreplay has developed in him\n\n \n Well, first I should say that a reflex is not the same as an instinct, or at least it certainly is not the same as a natural preference. The reflex to jerk away from pain can certainly be overcome, but this does not change the fact that the individual prefers no pain over pain. However, the individual also prefers sexual pleasure, and he has a natural attraction to the situation of being dominated or hurt during sexual encounters. So the individual here is only choosing one natural preference (his sexual attraction) over another (his preference of no pain over pain). Perhaps it would be possible for an individual to choose hurt himself willingly without reason, yet I'm not even so certain about this; the individual cannot change himself to prefer pain to no pain. Even if you hurt yourself now, upon reading this, you are not doing so simply because you prefer pain to no pain, you would be doing so in order to prove a point, to satisfy a different natural preference.\n \n \nsimilarly, there are people that refuse meat, even though it tastes good, and even though the body requires the nutrients we get from meat. vegetarian have no desire at all for meat, although most of them at some point were meat eaters (unless they grew up in a vegetarian household). meat still would taste the same to them, but their preference has changed\n\n \n Again, one natural preference has been chosen over another. The vegetarian, although preferring the taste of meat to the taste of no meat, has no desire to actually eat meat because he is overwhelmed by the more important desire to preserve animal life and/or to live a healthy life, both of which are rooted in natural desires. The important thing is that the vegetarian has not changed the fact that he or she prefers the taste of meat. One only needs look at the variety of meat-imitation products available to prove this point. I do eat meat, but I dated a vegan (no meat, no dairy, no animal products). Because of this, I tried a lot of imitation meats which my significant other liked. Frankly, they did taste like meat; the vegetarian does not change his preference for the taste of meat.\n \n \nthat is why i said that taste and preference are not always interchangeable. i just wanted to clarify that\n\n \n I see what you're saying; yet what you mean when saying \"preference\" is not what I mean when I say \"natural preference.\" I think that your \"preference\" is the resulting action after taking all \"natural preferences\" and learned knowledge about how to achieve those preferences into consideration.",

   "what about gays that claimed that they changed their sexual orientation from straight to gay and havent reverted? apparently, these are examples of successful sexual orientation changes\n\n \n As requested:\n \n http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_spit.htm\n \n \nANALYSIS OF DR. SPITZER'S STUDY OF REPARATIVE THERAPY\n \n Professional organizations and conversion therapy:\n \n Various professional organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Psychiatric Association, American Psychological Association, and the National Association of Social Workers have stated that a person's sexual orientation cannot be changed by reparative therapy. 1,2\n \n The one exception is the very small group: National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality (NARTH).  NARTH was founded in 1992 as a \"non-profit, educational organization dedicated to the research, therapy and prevention of homosexuality.\" It currently consists of \"more than 1,000 mental-health professionals.\" -- fewer than 1% of the therapists who belong to either of the APA's. 3,4 NARTH strongly advocates the use of reparative therapy, believing it to be very effective and safe. They regard homosexual behavior as a treatable disorder.\n The American Academy of Pediatrics, American Counseling Association, American Association of School Administrators, American Federation of Teachers, American Psychological Association, American School Health Association, Interfaith Alliance Foundation, National Association of School Psychologists, National Association of Social Workers, and National Education Association have formed the \"Just the Facts Coalition.\" In 1999, they developed and endorsed \"Just the Facts About Sexual Orientation & Youth: A Primer for Principals, Educators and School Personnel.\" It includes a number of quotations from major professional organizations expressing concern about reparative therapy and other methods of attempting to change an individual's sexual orientation. One example is the American Academy of Pediatrics, which stated: \"Therapy directed specifically at changing sexual orientation is contraindicated, since it can provoke guilt and anxiety while having little or no potential for achieving changes in orientation.\" 5\n \n \n Background of Dr. Spitzer's study:\n \n Dr. Robert Spitzer is a Professor of Psychiatry at Columbia University. During his three decades of psychiatric research, he has specialized in the topic of human sexual orientation. In 1973, he was one of the members of the American Psychiatric Association who was instrumental in removing homosexuality from their list of mental illnesses. The APA was the first major mental-health agency to do so. \n \n For their annual conference in 2000-MAY, the American Psychiatric Association had scheduled a panel discussion to debate whether there is any hard evidence that an adult's sexual orientation can be altered through reparative therapy. Dr. Robert Spitzer was scheduled to be the moderator. Two psychiatrists withdrew from the panel, stating that the topic is too politically charged to permit scientific discussion. The debate was then cancelled. According to the APA: \"The doctors who were to debate on the topic decided there was not enough scientific information to have a proper debate. They felt that any debate would turn into a political debate and not a true scientific debate. While there is information on reorientation therapy, there have been no controlled research studies.\" 6 Dr. Spitzer said: \"I think we ought to be able to talk about anything in a dispassionate way.\" Referring to the speakers who dropped out, he said, \"I think they [the psychiatrists who withdrew] felt that to even debate it was to legitimize the topic and they felt that since the groups that they regard as their enemy were kind of salivating over having the debate, they didn't want it.\"\n \n Exodus International, a Fundamentalist Christian group who tries to help gays and lesbians change their sexual behavior, protested the cancellation. Their national board chairman, John Paulk of Colorado Springs, CO, said: \"I'm here as one representative for a virtually unseen but sizable population. I once lived as a gay man, but now I'm heterosexual, something the American Psychiatric Association says does not exist.\" 10 It is notable that he did not say that he was once gay; he said that he \"lived as a gay man.\" We suspect that he has had a bisexual orientation during all of his adult life, engaging first in homosexual behavior, and more recently in heterosexual behavior.\n \n At the time of the proposed debate, Dr. Spitzer suspected that an adult's sexual orientation is fixed. He said: \"There is no documentary evidence showing someone's sexual preference can be changed by therapy.\n \n The term \"sexual preference\" is normally only meaningful when used to refer to persons with a bisexual orientation  -- adults who are attracted to both men and women. Bisexuals are often attracted to one gender more that the other. They can thus be described as having a \"preference.\" who The vast majority of adults have either a heterosexual or homoosexual orientation. They are attracted to only one gender, and thus cannot accurately be said to have a \"preference.\" Dr. Spitzer appears to have used the term here in place of the more generally used term \"sexual orientation.\"  \n He continued: \"There is only anecdotal evidence, mostly from the therapists themselves, claiming that what they do works. That's not very scientific. On the other hand, there's no scientific evidence to show that this is impossible...It hasn't been studied.\"\n \n Before the scheduled debate, Dr. Spitzer had decided to conduct a study of \"ex-gays\" and \"ex-lesbians,\" These are individuals who:\n - Had once identified themselves as homosexuals.\n - Had attempted to change their sexual orientation by:\n - either engaging in reparative therapy with a therapist, or\n - transformational ministry.\n - Now consider themselves to be heterosexual.\n \n Almost all are Evangelical Christians.\n \n Definitions of terms:\n \n Since essentially all \"ex-gays\" and \"ex-lesbians\" are conservative Christians, they generally use the same definitions of words as do Fundamentalist and other Evangelical Christians. That is:\n - They regard a homosexual as a person who has sex with others of the same gender. That is, their definition is based on a person's behavior. This differs from the definition of \"homosexual\" by most therapists, human sexuality researchers, religious liberals, gays and lesbians. These latter groups define a homosexual as a person who is sexually attracted  only to members of the same gender -- whether these feelings are acted upon or not.\n - They rarely refer to bisexuals -- persons who are attracted to both men and women. They generally lump them together with gays and lesbians or with heterosexuals, depending upon their behavior  at the time.\n - A person with a bisexual orientation who enters therapy and makes a decision to confine their sexual relationship(s) to members of the opposite gender are considered to have \"left the homosexual lifestyle,\" to have become \"ex-gays\" or \"ex-lesbians,\" and to have become heterosexual. They are counted as success stories by reparative therapists or transformational ministries. Non-Evangelicals would suggest that the individuals are still bisexual; their orientation has remained unchanged.\n - A person with a homosexual orientation who decides to become celibate is also considered a victory for reparative therapy or a transformation ministry; they have become an \"ex.\" Again, non-Evangelicals would suggest that the individuals have not changed their orientation, which remains homosexual. They are simply celibate homosexuals.\n \n -\n About the study:\n \n According to Parul Varnell of the Chicago Free Press, \"Spitzer admits that he had 'great difficulty' finding people who claimed to have changed their orientation from gay to straight. Ex-gay groups regularly claim to know of 'thousands' of people who have 'changed' or 'left homosexuality.' But after searching for nearly a year and a half, Spitzer could only find 274 possibilities.\" 8\n Dr. Robert Spitzer finally studied 143 \"ex-gays\" and 57 \"ex-lesbians\" who had reported that they had become \"straight.\" During 45 minute telephone interviews with each subject, they were asked 60 questions about their \"feelings and behavior before and after their efforts to change orientation. They discussed their motives for change; their strategies, which included counseling, support groups, prayer and mentoring; and their current relationships with the opposite sex\". 7\n \n Dr. Spitzer reported:\n - \"Some people can and do change. Like most psychiatrists, I thought that homosexual behavior could only be resisted, and that no one could really change their sexual orientation. I now believe this to be false.\" 17\n - That 86% of the men and 63% of the subjects emerged from therapy still having feelings of attraction to persons of the same-sex. That is, after therapy they are bisexuals, not heterosexuals.\n - That sixteen (11%) of the men and 21 (37%) of the women report that they now have a heterosexual orientation. It is not known how many of these had entered therapy as bisexuals and how many had been homosexuals.\n - That 66% of the males and 44% of the females had arrived at \"good heterosexual functioning.\" According to Cnn.com, that term is defined as having been \"in a sustained, loving heterosexual relationship within the past year, getting enough satisfaction from the emotional relationship with their partner to rate at least seven on a 10-point scale, having satisfying heterosexual sex at least monthly and never or rarely thinking of somebody of the same sex during heterosexual sex.\" \n bullet \n \n \"Of the 112 men (out of the total 143) who acknowledged that they masturbated, more than half (56 percent) said they used homosexual fantasies some of the time and about one-third (31 percent) said they seldom had opposite-sex masturbation fantasies.\"  8\n \n Of the 200 subjects, 86 had been referred to Dr. Spitzer by conservative Christian groups specializing in converting homosexuals. NARTH referred 46 subjects. Some other sources provided 68. It is apparent that the individuals that Dr. Spitzer interviewed were hand-selected from a very large group of persons who had either a homosexual or a bisexual orientation. Those who had been unable to change their sexual behavior would not have become subjects in the study.\n \n There are more than 1,000 professional therapists who belong to NARTH. Assume that the average member has treated 50 clients a year for the past five years. That means that there are over 250,000 clients from which NARTH could select subjects for this study. Assuming that reparative therapy had a \"cure\" rate of 0.02% then NARTH would have been able to provide the approximately 50 \"successful\" clients to this study. But a cure rate of 0.02% can be expressed as a failure rate of 99.98% -- not a promising form of therapy! If one considers the anecdotal accounts of gays and lesbians who have committed suicide after failed reparative therapy, then it becomes even less attractive.\n \n Dr. Spitzer reported his findings at a meeting of the American Psychiatric Association on 2001-MAY-9.\n \n In later interviews, Dr. Spitzer said:\n - \"Our sample was self-selected from people who already claimed they had made some change. We don't know how common that kind of change is. . . . I'm not saying that this can be easily done, or that most homosexuals who want to change can make this kind of change. I suspect it's quite unusual.\" 13\n - \"I suspect the vast majority of gay people would be unable to alter by much a firmly established homosexual orientation.\" 14\n - \"...the kinds of changes my subjects reported are highly unlikely to be available to the vast majority [of gays and lesbians]... \"[only] a small minority -- perhaps 3% -- might have a \"malleable\" sexual orientation.\" He expressed a concern that his study results were being \"twisted by the Christian right.\" 15\n \n Responses to Dr. Spitzer's study:\n \n In response to Dr. Spitzer's study, the APA issued a statement affirming its position and cautioning that \"there is no published evidence supporting the efficacy of reparative therapy as a treatment to change one's sexual orientation.\" Quoted in Ref. 2\n \n Other comments were:\n - David Elliot, spokesperson for the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force said, \"The sample is terrible, totally tainted, totally unrepresentative of the gay and lesbian community.\"\n - Psychologist Douglas Haldeman of the University of Washington commented that there is no credible scientific evidence that sexual orientation can be changed, \"and this study doesn't prove that either.\" He noted that the participants appeared unusually skewed towards religious conservatives and people treated by therapists \"with a strong anti-gay bias.\"\n - Joan Gerry of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) referred to the subjects as \"a self-selected sample of people who are so troubled by their sexual orientation that they will go to any lengths to attempt to 'change' it....These are people who live in a world where gays, lesbians and bisexuals are treated like second-class citizens.\"\n - The CNN.com report on the study claim that \"some gay people can turn straight if they really want to.\" \n - Doug Nave of Covenant Network of Presbyterians commented: \"...the subjects did not have any anonymity that might help them candidly report unfavorable outcomes; Spitzer could not assess their credibility face-to-face; and the findings were based entirely on the subjects' self-report (rather than, e.g., physiological measures of arousal), which research has shown is often very misleading. In addition, Spitzer's study has not been subject to any peer review or other normal professional tests of validity. Some therefore believe that the study merits no credit at all.\" 12\n - Barbara Pogue of the Lone Star Citizen, wrote: \"Spitzer concluded that sexual orientation shifts are definitely possible, albeit rare, unusual and difficult.\" 16\n - Joe Nicolosi, president of the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality (NARTH), said that the study is \"an historic event in the history of psychiatry's understanding of homosexuality.\" 17\n - Family Research Council, a Fundamentalist Christian group, simply reported that: \"Dr Robert Spitzer's study of 200 former homosexuals found that change is possible... [He] found that 66 percent of the men and 44 percent of the women had achieved 'good heterosexual functioning.' The vast majority of the study participants reported that they were bothered only slightly, or not at all, by unwanted homosexual feelings.\" The implication is that the subjects were chosen at random from among homosexuals who had gone through therapy, and that most homosexuals can change their orientation. This is deceptive reporting. 18\n - Family Research Council reported that the Spitzer study was not widely reported in the media. However, Exodus International, the largest Fundamentalist Christian umbrella group of transformational ministries stated that: \"The Spitzer study is reported in today's issue of USA Today, The Washington Post, The New York Times, and was released to hundreds of local newspapers by the Associated Press. The story is also being widely reported on the World Wide Web through such prominent news sites as foxnews.com, cbsnews.com, abcnews.go.com, and msnbc.com. Dr. Spitzer was featured on this morning's edition of 'Good Morning America.' \" 19\n - ABC News interviewed Dr. Spitzer about the hazards of \"change therapy.\" He replied: \"There's no doubt that many homosexuals have been unsuccessful and, attempting to change, become depressed and their life becomes worse...I'm not disputing that. What I am disputing is that is invariably the outcome.\" He later told ABC news that some of his subjects had become despondent and even depressed after having been told \"...by many mental health professionals that there was no hope for them, they had to just learn to live with their homosexual feelings.\" 19\n \n \n Conclusions:\n \n We have not been able to find any information on the 200 subjects' original sexual orientation. We suspect that most or all had a bisexual orientation and had previously engaged in at least some homosexual activity. After therapy, we suspect that they remained bisexual, and feel that they have successfully developed a relationship with a person of the opposite gender.\n \n Telephone interview data on behavior and practice are notoriously unreliable. Individuals often answer questions according to what they think others expect of them. For example:\n - 17% of American adults say that they tithe (i.e. give 10 to 13% of their income to their church). Only 3% really do. 9\n - Many polls indicate that the percentage of adults who say that they regularly attend religious services is about 40% in the U.S., 20% in Canada and perhaps 10% or less in Europe. But when noses are actually counted, the true figures are about half the stated figures (about 20% in the U.S. and 10% in Canada.) \n \n On a topic as incendiary as changing one's sexual orientation, a lack of honesty can be expected on the part of many of the participants.\n \n Assuming that the more than 1,000 therapists in NARTH each have had 50 clients per year over the previous five years, then they have treated over 250,000 homosexuals and bisexuals with reparative therapy. Various transformational ministries have treated other gays, bisexuals and lesbians who were seeking change. Yet, Dr. Spitzer was only able to find 274 potential subjects for his study in all of America. This data alone indicates that reparative therapy is almost always a failure.\n \n \n References:\n \n 1. \"Answers to your questions about sexual orientation and homosexuality,\" American Psychological Association, at: http://helping.apa.org/daily/answers.html \n 2.

Although it would be impossible to predict outside influences, one should be able to predict it with some reasonable amount of accuracy.\n \n As for two individuals with all of the same traits, well in theory the answer is no, for all of the same brain structure would imply that the brain holds the same memories, knowledge, etc. However, if we're talking about twins, this might be possible. I would find it very likely that twins would have the same underlying sexual attractions, but as twins undergo different experiences, they learn to apply those underlying sexual attractions to different sensory information. Different diets could also affect hormone production. I should also mention identical twins are not always 100% genetically identical, but even with that knowledge at hand, I would be surprised if they identified a very different set of underlying features and situations they are attracted to.",

   "any statement that homosexuality cannot be changed is opinion as well, so it is simply a case of words against words. however, those that claim that sexual orientation can have actually changed their sexual orientation. the fact that they have changged their sexual orientation is evidence that sexual orientation can change. what evidence can be presented that homosexuality cannot change to refute the evidence that it can? please present it\n\n \n http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/facts_changing.html\n \n \n Claims about the \"success\" of conversion therapies have appeared mainly in the mass media and on the World Wide Web, rather than in high-quality, peer-reviewed scientific journals. A 2000 paper by Joseph Nicolosi and his colleagues was published in Psychological Reports. Psychological Reports is also the major outlet for Paul Cameron, the discredited antigay psychologist. As detailed elsewhere on this site, Psychological Reports has very low prestige among researchers and a low rejection rate. In addition, unlike other psychological journals, it charges its authors a fee to publish their papers.\n \n However, in May of 2001, two papers on the topic of conversion therapies were presented at the American Psychiatric Association's annual convention. One paper, by Dr. Robert Spitzer, reported findings from 45-minute telephone interviews with 143 men and 57 women who had sought help to change their sexual orientation. He found that 66 percent of the men and 44 percent of the women had achieved \"good heterosexual functioning\" and he attributed this to the interventions.\n \n The Spitzer study was immediately criticized on several grounds. For example, the sample consisted predominantly of activists recruited from \"ex-gay\" and anti-gay organizations. About two thirds were referred to Spitzer by so-called \"ex-gay ministries,\" such as Exodus, or by the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality (NARTH). Of those who participated, 78 percent had spoken publicly in favor of efforts to convert homosexuals to heterosexuality.\n \n This is a potential weakness of the study because activists are highly motivated to report that they successfully changed their sexual orientation. Consequently, they may present an inaccurate impression of themselves to researchers. Dr. Spitzer took the activists' testimonials at face value, with no checks on the reliability or validity of their self-reports. In his relatively brief interviews with them, Dr. Spitzer may not have been able to detect factual errors or misstatements - intentional or inadvertent - by the activists.\n \n Dr. Spitzer's study also appears to suffer from some of the same methodological flaws as the published studies discussed above. For example, only a minority of the participants (about 40%) were exclusively attracted to partners of the same sex before they attempted to change. As noted above, including bisexuals in studies evaluating the outcomes of conversion therapies tends to inflate the proportion of \"successes.\"\n \n Dr. Spitzer did not claim that his findings could be generalized to the gay and lesbian population at large. Indeed, he was quoted in the New York Times as saying that, despite the findings from his study, the number of homosexuals who could successfully become heterosexual was likely to be \"pretty low.\" He also conceded that participants in his study were \"unusually religious\" and were not necessarily representative of most gay men and lesbians in the United States.\n \n The second APA paper, presented by Dr. Ariel Shidlo and Dr. Michael Schroeder, reported findings from a study  of 202 homosexuals who were recruited through the Internet and direct mailings to groups advocating conversion therapy. Most of the participants (178, or 88%) reported that efforts to change their sexual orientation had failed. Only 6 (3%) achieved what the researchers considered a heterosexual shift. Drs. Shidlo and Schroeder also reported that many respondents were harmed by the attempt to change. \n\n \n These are STUDIES, NOT opinions.",

This shouldn't be interpreted to mean that an individual can change his or her underlying sexual preferences or that anyone's sexual preferences can apply to males or females, only that some people's sexual preferences probably can.\n\n then orientation is based on what is learned, rather than what is innate. say our twins share the underlying gay preference, but one is gay and the other is not, is the straight twin really straight? then again it could be that both share an underlying straight preference, so is the gay one really gay?\n \n it comes back to the question: how do you determine someone's sexual orientation?",

   "YES. The twins studies, whether you accept the conclusions or not.\n\n if you dont mind, lets take a look at the twin studies, and examine the conclusions\n \n in a survey of identical twins, it was found that 52% of twins that were gay had a gay co-twin. among paternal twins, only 22% of twins that were gay had a gat co-twin. scientists conclude that genetics have some influence on sexual orientation\n \n the problem with the study is, there are other factors that influence identity, namely environment and choice. in each of these twins, their sexual orientation could have been the result of any one, combination of 2, or combination of all 3 factors. in other words, it is quite possible that any one or 2 factors had absolutely no influence\n \n let O be someone's orientation, and x, y and z be the factors genetics, environment and choice. we know that there is 2 times the genetic similarity (100%) in identical twins than in non-identical twins (50%)\n \n xa+ya+za=O (for non-dentical twins)\n \n 2xb+yb+zb=2O (for identical twins)\n \n 1. the genes of the gay identical twins and non-identical twins were not examined for unique similarities: xa << xb\n 2. the environments of the pairs were not compared: ya << yb\n 3. the education and experiences of the gay pairs were not compared: za << zb\n \n if we assume that genetics is the factor that influences homosexuality, then 2xa = 2O =< x=O, meaning tha x is solely responsible for sexual orientaion. however, this would be wrong, since 48% of the gay twins had the same gene x but different orientation O, so x << O\n \n what we end up with is 2 equations with 6 variables. since we have no knowledge about the relationship between any of the factors as it corresponds to the actual orientatino of any twins, we still cannot make any assumptions about the value of any variables, nor the relationship between any variables and the resulting orientation. for instance, xa could be 0 (\"straight genes\" entirely) yet ya and za combined caused O to be gay. then again, it could be choice and genes in one instance (xa+za), and genes and environment in another (xb+yb). the point is, we dont know\n \n the study tells us absolutely zilch about the relatinoship between genetics and sexual orientation",

   "except in the very rare occasion where one twin undergoes some genetic mutation, ALL twins have identical DNA. all identical twins are conceived from a single cell, making 2 individuals.\n\n \n But this is not very rare. Mutations happen in everyone many, many times.\n \n \nno study or scientific finding can conclusively support this. there is nothing that indicates that genetics necessarily plays a role in orientation whatsoever. the closest assertion you can make to this effect is that genetics MAY be the root cause. anything beyond that is not supported by any known evidence\n\n \n Sure, no study can conclusively support my theory, but lots of studies can unconclusively support it. This study has produced results consistant with my theory, and thus the study unconclusively supports it.\n \n \nlike we established before, it is absolutely impossible to determine a persoon's \"underlying sexual preference\". in fact, we have no real reason to assume that such a thing even exists\n\n \n I don't think we established this before. Didn't I suggest ways to try to test a person's underlying sexual preferences? We could try to question objective individuals about the specific things they are attracted to, we could present subjects with visual stimuli to measure hormone production, we could look for the appropriate genes (though this would require a far greater gene knowledge) etc.\n \n You've said we have no reason to believe it exists, but don't we actually have every reason to believe it exists? Allow me to explain. Consider your own sexual attractions; if they are like mine or like anyone else's you seem to be attracted to specific features and situations, not to individuals, even though society would seem to teach that it is individuals who are attractive. One might even be attracted to a stone sculpture, even though society does not teach that sculptures are sexually attractive, because that sculpture is shaped like a naked person. The vast majority of people claim to not be able to change their sexual orientation, and efforts to change sexual orientation in some people fail miserably. Sexual attraction is created through production of certain chemicals in the body that stimulate a sensation, and that chemical production cannot be turned on and off by choice. Other such chemical prodcutions appear to be turned off and on based on the genetic code of the individual. Most other sensations of the individual appear to be genetically-rooted. Are these not reason to suggest that genetic sexual preferences exist?\n \n \nproperly designed controlled scientific experiment can and do measure all the variables involved. a \"control\" in an experiment is a separate observation group of the same phenomenon, without affecting the tested variable. an example of this is the simple test of determining if table salt helps plants grow. you have 2 sets of seedlings, same seed type, same soil conditions (same soil source), same light and temperature conditions. one is watered with regular water, the other with a salt solution. then they are observed. if the salty plants grow better, or worse, then it can be determined that salt water directly affects growth. if there is no difference, then it can be determined that salt has no effect on plant growth. this exact experiment can be repeated, and if the results are continuously the same, the it the effects of salt on plants have been scientifically proven. this is how you control the experiment and eliminate unwanted variables\n\n \n Yet if you repeat the experiment, then you will see a different height in both plants. It is because as much as you may try to control the differences in the experiements, you simply cannot control everything. In this case, the paternal twins act as the control group reasonably enough, and although the study does not act as conclusive proof, few studies do.\n \n \nhow do you come to this conclusion? in identical twins, the X chromosome would also be identical. nothing about the chromosomes that influence orientation can be concluded from this study.\n\n \n I come to this conclusion because people who share the same genetic code on the X-chromosome are over twice as likely to share the same sexual orientation than those who do not share the same X-chromosome. Although learned ability to apply one's natural attractions would make certain that identical twins are never 100% the same sexual orientation, the increase in similar sexual preference seen in those who share the same genes suggests that genes do play a role in sexual orientation.\n \n \nif this is the case, then the twins would always have identical \"underlying preferences\" in all aspects, including sexual orientation. is there any way to determine this \"underlying sexual preference\"?\n\n \n In theory, yes, as explained above, though admittedly it would be very difficult to do, for if an individual unlearned about his sexual attractions may have a difficult time accurately reporting them. However I would expect it to be far easier than trying to show that every individual learns or chooses sexual attraction with no regard to genetics.",

In fact, the support you have provided indicating that homosexuality is a choice is based entirely on individual evaluations of oneself.

You also state that you believe you have made a choice.

Or at least they will certainly know that they have not made a choice, even if sometimes they think they made a choice even though they actually had no choice. This does not necessarily mean that they have not been taught a behavior. The individual testimonies about whether or not someone believes homosexuality to be a choice can help guide us toward creating a good test; we should start our test with a hypothesis that reflects the information that we believe to be true, then form a test to try to support it. We don't just form a hypothesis off the tops of our heads, there must be ample support for such a guess, and the testimony of individuals should play a role in that.\n \n Evaluation of oneself is also a very useful tool, especially when debating over the existence of choice. If you are able to flow freely into and out of sexual attraction, if you can create sexual attraction to anything one day, then destroy that attraction the next, then surely it is a choice. Just the same, if I am able to run in a circle one day, then decide not to do that the next, then running around in a circle should be a choice. Yet when the lines between choice and no choice blur, we must consider the root reasons that we act the way we do, and we must try to determine whether those are choices.\n \n My hypothesis about the origins of sexual orientation was formulated partially because I looked into myself and seem to have identified a set of core sexual attractions.

When breeding homozygous tall plants with homozygous short plans, Gregor Mendel observed that most of the children plants are tall. This did not mean that Mendel thought the tall plants outweighed the short plants, it meant that plants are more likely to be tall than short. On the same note, observing that most people cannot change their sexual orientation suggests that it is more likely that a person cannot change his or her sexual orientation. Certainly the mind is more complex than just a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer to whether or not someone can change sexual orientation, but the testimony of these people can still be used as insight to form an educated hypothesis.\n \n \ni would submit that i dont believe your hypothesis is even scientifically testable to begin with. the assumption that underlying sexual traits (or any underlying traits) exist can only be supported by the testimony of those that claim theyve always had these traits. even if we suppose that a person's current personality is there underlying trait, if that personality radically changes to something else, under your hypothesis we can assume that the new personality is actually that person's underlying trait. this sort of ad hoc justification will not stand up to scientific review.\n \n we have no observable way to observe these traits or even determine if they exist. and we have no observeable way to determine if a trait manifested in a person is actually their underlying trait, or if the real underlying trait is still hidden. furthermoe, we have no way to predict what conditions would force these underlying traits to the surface, if they exist and are hidden.\n \n how exactly would you model an experiment to test this?\n\n \n Hmm, I should start by stating that it whether my hypothesis is scientifically testable does not have an effect on whether it is correct. Surely you do not know a way to test that sexual orientation is changable for everyone, do you?\n \n Anyhow, as for testing my hypothesis, the most direct route would be to first identify the hormones and chemicals that stimulate sexual arousal. Then we would have to identify all of the specific genes that control the production of these chemicals and hormones. Then we would have to identify the specific brain signals that stimulate the production of these hormones. Then we would have to identify the specific situation in which the brain produces these signals. Then we would have to identify which of those situations were genetically coded into the brain during its formation and which are the result of learned behavior.\n \n Of course that would require a vast increase in knowledge of the brain and genetics. More realistically, in order to conduct a truly scientific experiment testing any theory about sexual attraction, we need some good way to measure it. Perhaps we can measure certain hormones or some other physical manifestation of sexual stimulation; if not, we'll have to take the individual's word on it, or there can be no scientific experiment regarding sexual attraction. However we are able to measure it, we might then conduct a study starting with an object which an individual does not find sexually attractive. We would then have to idenfity what we believe to be underlying, unchangable sexual attractions in individuals (which could be done by , and measure how much their sexual attraction changes if we teach them to change it or tell them to change it. We would then have to identify common sexual attractions which we believe are not present in individuals, then see how much we can increase those sexual attractions through the same method.",

If he thought it meant something that it did not, then don't worry, just explain what you meant. If you have no problem with homosexuality, let him know.\n\n i'm not denying that i meant something negative by the statement. i'm pointing out that the statement in question had nothing to do with homosexuality. if you look at what steve did, he snipped the statement that says \"it is a behavior you can and should change\" out of its original context, giving it an implication that was never originally there. there is no dispute that the statement itself had negative intents, but it was not about homosexuality. have you actually looked at post 204?\n \n i have no problem with homosexuality, like i've said countless times. there is no condemnation or anything of the sort in my mind towards them. in fact, homosexual sex seems to be a very interesting variant to heterosexual sex.\n \n my position about homosexuality is strictly concerning the cause. i oppose the popular belief that science has found evidence linking homosexuality to genetics. as far as i see, they have not. it does not mean that there is absolutely no link between genetics and homosexuality, just that we have no reason to assume such based on any evidence we have observed. if people want to misrepresent this as a position of denying gay rights or homophopia, then that is there misunderstanding. there are many gays that agree with me concerning the lack of evidence linking homosexuality to genetics, so are they also denying gay rights and homophobic?",

As I said, it originally looked to me as though you were referring to homosexuality. This is because learning to read is not commonly thought of as a \"behavior\", yet your argument throughout this thread has been that homosexuality is a behavior. Because of this, it initially appeared that you were reffering to homosexuality. Yet when you pointed out that you were reffering to learning to read, it became clear to me that you were making a witty comparison, that while homosexuality may not be something one should change, reading is.\n \n My point was not that you did not intend to say something negative, only that you aren't going to convince many by using negative comments or responding to insults with more insults. That sort of conversation tends to result in people sticking to their guns no matter how right or wrong they are, and it tends to make people frustrated.\n \n \ni have no problem with homosexuality, like i've said countless times. there is no condemnation or anything of the sort in my mind towards them. in fact, homosexual sex seems to be a very interesting variant to heterosexual sex.\n \n my position about homosexuality is strictly concerning the cause. i oppose the popular belief that science has found evidence linking homosexuality to genetics. as far as i see, they have not. it does not mean that there is absolutely no link between genetics and homosexuality, just that we have no reason to assume such based on any evidence we have observed. if people want to misrepresent this as a position of denying gay rights or homophopia, then that is there misunderstanding. there are many gays that agree with me concerning the lack of evidence linking homosexuality to genetics, so are they also denying gay rights and homophobic?\n\n \n Well, are you not here to represent your viewpoint so that others might judge it and even come to understand it? Maybe if someone else misunderstands you, it is your problem too. Saying negative things about individuals is going to hurt your viewpoint in the eyes of others, so I'm asking if you are willing to try to stop this negative discussion and try for a more positive one.\n \n If the topic is still open, I still think that a study showing increased homosexuality percentages across twins with a similar X-chromosome as compared to twins without one qualifies as scientific evidence suggesting that homosexuality is at least partially the result of genetics. Certainly it is not proof, of course, but accumulated evidence leads to theories. And a theory means something; evolution, gravity, and even the idea that the Earth revolves around the sun are all theories. Surely there isn't nearly enough evidence to develop a theory about homosexuality, but some evidence is more than none.",

   "very well. it still stands that steve could not find 1 ngative thing i said about homosexuals. i think that point has been made\n\n \n What happend is: you posted something that sounded different than you meant. Steve misread it, and assumed it meant something else. You two worked together to figure out the misunderstanding and correct it. Fantastic work on both sides, if you ask me.\n \n \nin order to make any meaningful comparisons about the twin study, it is necessary to compare the result based on twins that do not share the same environment. we have to remember that very often, identical twins are raised alike. they are made to wear the same clothes, they go everywhere together in their younger years, they are repeatedly told that they are just like their twin. clearly, the similarity in environment and experiences among identical twins is much greater than that among non-identical twins, where their similarities are not as enforced. this fact cannot be ignored when looking at the results of the gay twin studies\n\n \n Well, I happen to be a fraternal twin, and I can assure you from personal experience that fraternal twins are also raised alike, share the same environment, are made to wear the same clothes, go everywhere together and are repeatedly told that they are just like their twin. Yet we still see that it is more common for twins who share the same genetics to share the same sexual orientation than it is for twins who do not. As you may realize, I am bisexual and my brother is not. Based on identical twins who I have known, I think there is a great deal of pressure put on both twins to be different from one another. If we assume that sexual orientation is partially learned, it may then be that we see a greater percentage of twins matching homosexuality if they are seperated.\n \n And I would love for there to be a study conducted of homosexual twins who have been seperated at birth, but simply put those twins just aren't very common. But just because a study could have theoretically been better does not mean that it is invalidated. If I conduct a study to try to prove the existence of wind, and 52% of the time, a piece of paper blows east when I drop it, I have evidence suggesting that wind exists. It may not be nearly enough evidence to make wind a theory or a proven fact, but it is consistant with what I would expect to see if there were wind, and it is not consistant with what I would expect to see if there were no wind. In the same fashion, I expect to see increased rates of homosexuality in all twins if it is learned, and I expect to see little difference in numbers comparing identical to non-identical twins if it is not genetic. I saw the opposite, and I have evidence suggesting that homosexuality is genetic. Sure, it may have been caused by other factors; that's why it's only evidence, not proof.\n \n \nGood luck Jaxian. This has been gone through countless times. I don't see how you can argue with someone who simple refuses to accept facts.\n\n \n Sure you do! It's the easiest. That person would keep throwing out invalid arguments that I easily respond to, and the debate would never come to a resolution because my opponent wouldn't accept facts. I could argue as long as I wanted!\n \n Well, I'm not convinced that unkerpaulie refuses to accept facts, but maybe that it's tough for us to understand why he holds his views and to convey our own.",
