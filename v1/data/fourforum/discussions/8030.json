   "From wikipedia as the edit post feature seems to be playing up for some reason.\n \nThe passage in Genesis 1:27 - \"So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them\" (before describing a mate being made of Adam's rib and being called Eve in Genesis 2:22) is sometimes believed to be an indication that Adam had a wife before Eve.\n \n A medieval reference to Lilith as the first wife of Adam is the anonymous The Alphabet of Ben-Sira, written sometime between the 8th and 11th centuries. Lilith is described as refusing to assume a subservient role to Adam during sexual intercourse and so deserting him (\"She said, 'I will not lie below,' and he said, 'I will not lie beneath you, but only on top. For you are fit only to be in the bottom position, while I am to be the superior one.'\"). Lilith promptly uttered the name of God, took to the air, and left the Garden, settling on the Red Sea coast. As a side note, this places Lilith in a unique position, for she left the Garden of her own accord and before the Fall of Man, and so is untouched by the Tree of Knowledge. However, according to legend, she also knows the \"true name of God\". To know the true name of God is to have power over him, this story is similar to Isis and the Secret Name of Ra.\n \n Lilith then went on to mate with Asmodai and various other demons she found beside the Red Sea, creating countless lilin. Adam urged God to bring Lilith back, so three angels were dispatched after her. When the angels, Senoy, Sansenoy, and Semangelof, made threats to kill one hundred of Lilith's demonic children for each day she stayed away, she countered that she would prey eternally upon the descendants of Adam and Eve, who could be saved only by invoking the names of the three angels. She did not return to Adam.\n \n The background and purpose of The Alphabet of Ben-Sira is unclear. It is a collection of stories about heroes of the Bible and Talmud, it may have been a collection of folk-tales, a refutation of Christian, Karaite, or other separatist movements; its content seems so offensive to contemporary Jews that it was even suggested that it could be an anti-Jewish satire [4], although, in any case, the text was accepted by the Jewish mystics of medieval Germany.\n \n The Alphabet of Ben-Sira is the earliest surviving source of the story, and the conception that Lilith was Adam's first wife became only widely known with the 17th century Lexicon Talmudicum of Johannes Buxtorf.\n \n In the late 19th century, the Scottish Christian author George MacDonald incorporated the story of Lilith as Adam's first wife and predator of Eve's children into a mythopoeic fantasy novel in the Romantic style.\n \n The role of Lilith as Adam's faithless wife has parallels with the ideas about Eve herself in the Unification theology of Sun Myung Moon.\n \n",

   "The serpent was being used or was Satan in the image of it. The creatures knew God, they were there when he created the world. The serpent (whatever it was) was not an evil serpent, it was Satan himself. Satan was a demon, he could look like anything. It doesn't sound ridiculous, it sounds perfectly normal.\n \n Genesis most certainly is history. Jesus himself referred to it and its events many times. If the credibility of Genesis is poor, then Jesus himself is incredible. I don't think God did what he did and have Moses write it like a story. Remember that Moses spoke personally with God many times, I don't think Moses conjured these things up himself.\n\n \n No doubt many Jews of the 1st century, including Jesus of Nazareth, believed that Genesis reflected actual history and that it, along with the rest of the Torah, was written by Moses. \n \n You might find the following to be of interest...\n \n The reader must understand that the Torah contains a great variety of material: laws, narratives, history, folk tales, songs, proverbial sayings, poetry, and, in the early parts of Genesis, myths and legends. Contemporary readers are often put off because they have been exposed to a method of biblical interpretation which understands the text in a literal way. Thus, if Genesis says that God created woman out of the rib of man, or tells of a serpent speaking, or of ancient man living several hundred years, the literalist interprets the story to mean precisely what the words convey. The contemporary reader familiar with the history and nature of the text will have to remember that a literal understanding of the Torah may lead to grave misconceptions. -- The Torah, A Modern Commentary, Union of American Hebrew Congregations Pub., New York\n \n and...\n \n Doubts that the Torah was a book set down by one author, Moses, developed some centuries ago...The early critics noted the differential use of the names of God in various parts of the Torah, the discrepancies of certain accounts and figures, and different literary styles. Later scholars further analyzed the text so that they could discern many authors and editors...\n \n The theory which continues to command general scholarly adherence is called the Documentary Hypothesis ...In substance it says that there are four major sources or documents (called J, E, P, and D), the combination of which during the fifth century BCE resulted in the creation of a single book, the Torah, which was declared a sacred text by official canonization about the year 400. - The Torah - A Modern Commentary, Edited by W. Gunther Plaut, Union of American Hebrew Congregations Pub.\n \n And...\n \n The anonymous authors of the Torah's legislation were certain that the laws they proposed were not of their invention but were derivable from Mosaic principles. - Etz Hayim - Torah and Commentary, The Rabbinical Assembly of the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, JPS Pub.",

   "No, the serpent was not 'The satan'.. you do know that 'satan' is a title meaning the 'accusor'. \n \n As for what Jesus said to have said or believed, it is totally irrelavent to what is actually IN genesis. The snake is genesis was not ha-satan. \n \n And, although it is tradition that Moses wrote the Torah, the torah does not say so itself. There are many items in the Torah that would be anacronisic if Moses wrote it (for example, talking about his own death for one, and also cities and people that didn't exist for hundreds of years after the time that moses was supposed to have been.)\n \n I have never seen a talknig snake, or a talking donkey for that matter. That sort of eliminates it being a 'history' in the manner you are thinking.\n\n \n Wait a second, Jesus was God, in the sense of the Trinity. Do you think he was just another Jew who believed a fairytale?\n \n I believe that Satan was the serpent who tempted Eve. If Satan does mean: \"the accusor\" then it certainly fits him. The first thing he did was question whether God meant it when they would die if they ate the fruit.\n \n In regard to the talking Serpent and talking Donkey, I'll say this.
