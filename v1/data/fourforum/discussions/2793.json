   "I was watching the early news this morning and they were playing the surveillance video showing the terrorists \"passing\" through the airport security checkpoints. Apparently these were the terrorists that ultimately crashed the plane into the Pentagon. The video is being used by attorneys for the surviving family members to file a lawsuit against the airlines and the security company for negligence and thus financial damages I would assume. These people apparently didn't accept the \"settlement\" from the government and I'm curious how this story was perceived by others.",

   "I don't understand what their basis is for a lawsuit. The terrorists met all requirements in place at the time for boarding a commercial flight. There are some questions being posed about lapses in some of their passports, and other information that should have raised red flags, but that is a governmental function, not private business, is it not?",
