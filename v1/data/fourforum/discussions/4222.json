   " \n Actually, the administration has announced 2005/6 budgets calling for expanded military spending using cuts in domestic social programs and deficits. \n \n The public can't do math, so he doesn't have to worry about it.\n \n\n \n I will provide the article. It shows the planned military budget cuts and \"transformed\" military. They are takign stuff away which is still needed for a \"small\" mythical level military.\n \n When you are dealing with record budget deficits, some things have to be cut, or taxes have to be raised. Since Bush has shown his is utterly unwilling to raise taxes to pay for his spending, cuts are going to be required in the military sooner or later.\n \n \n Perhaps I worded it badly, but they are cutting things that are really essential in favour of some mythical modular coverup. Cuts are really just causing them to scale down, replace things, and use \"other\" alternatives.\n \n \n \n Defense budget cuts compel military transformation \n By James Kitfield, National Journal \n January 28, 2005 \n \n The Bush administration's much-touted \"transformation\" of the United States military has always been something of a faith-based initiative. \n \n It is founded on an unshakable belief in the transformative powers of Information Age technology and best business practices, and a conviction that emerging dangers to U.S. security are too unpredictable to be identified by the armed services' traditional \"threat-based\" analyses. \n \n \n The traditional approach, the transformation advocates said, left the U.S. military merely a smaller, outdated mirror image of its Cold War self, based primarily on Air Force fighter wings, Navy aircraft carrier battle groups, and conventional Army divisions. \n \n \n From the outset, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and his aides in the Office of the Secretary of Defense pushed instead a \"capabilities-based\" approach to defense planning. The capabilities that OSD very much preferred were space-based, precision-guided, rapidly deployable, joint service, modular, and unconventional. \n \n After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, an unconventional war in Afghanistan, a protracted guerrilla campaign in Iraq, and ballooning budget deficits, it seems that, like it or not, the services are about to see the light of transformation. Radical change is upon them. As just one recent example, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz signed Program Budget Decision 753 on December 23, 2004, and the document was quickly leaked to the press. It outlines nearly $30 billion of cuts in planned defense spending over the next six years. Many of the programs targeted for cuts are much prized by service leaders. \n \n At the same time, programs associated with the Rumsfeld transformation effort are slated to receive significant boosts in spending over the same period. Combined with a fiscal 2006 Defense budget request expected in early February, and the Quadrennial Defense Review study scheduled to begin later next month, the budget memorandum is expected by many analysts to give the clearest indication to date of the direction and long-term implications of the Rumsfeld transformation. \n \n \"Rumsfeld has finally been forced to go after weapons programs for the same reason Willy Sutton robbed banks -- because that's where the remaining money is,\" Andrew Krepinevich, executive director of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, said in an interview. \"For the most part, he's cutting sacred cows among the 'legacy' programs, like fighter aircraft and ships, and protecting more-novel programs like unmanned aerial vehicles, space communications, and Army modularity. In that sense, the direction outlined is transformational.\" \n \n The fact that Pentagon civilians leaked the proposed cuts even before the quadrennial review process began, Krepinevich said, could signal that after four years in office, the Rumsfeld team is now confident of its transformational direction and is poised to implement profound change through major program cuts and shifts that will affect the military for decades. \"The global war on terror has also given [Rumsfeld] enormous leverage,\" Krepinevich said. \"He's dealing with a largely compliant Republican Congress. Finally, budget pressures are forcing tough decisions on weapons programs that probably should have been made earlier, but the political environment was not conducive.\" \n \n The Pentagon's proposed spending cuts reveal just how dramatically the grounds for debate have shifted onto turf favorable to transformation advocates. Reversing the stated wishes of Air Force leaders, the Pentagon targeted the service's top-priority F/A-22 fighter plane, reducing the planned buy from 381 to just 180 aircraft and cutting $10.5 billion from the program. Such a cut could throw the Air Force's tactical-aviation program into turmoil, raising questions of how the service can replace a rapidly aging fleet of 1970s- and 1980s-era F-15 fighters. Transformation advocates have long argued, however, that the Air Force is overinvested in tactical fighter wings that lack the range and flexibility to operate in regions without forward U.S. air bases. \n \n The Navy would fare no better under the proposed plan, [B}losing an aircraft carrier to early retirement -- thus shrinking the carrier fleet from 12 to 11 -- and seeing its proposed purchases of Virginia-class submarines and next-generation DD(X) destroyers cut to the tune of $7.9 billion.[/B] According to press reports, Navy planners are likely to go even further in the quadrennial review, proposing a reduction in the carrier fleet -- the onetime queens of the blue-water chessboard -- to 10, or even nine, flattops. Transformation advocates have argued that the carriers are too vulnerable, and that the Navy relies too heavily on them as the centerpiece of its forward-presence mission and wartime surge capability. \n \n Meanwhile, under Wolfowitz's memo, the Army's plan to shift from a structure based on large divisions to one based on modular and smaller brigade combat teams -- the linchpin of its transformation effort -- would be boosted by $25 billion over the next six years. That largely answers criticisms from transformation advocates that Army divisions are too heavy and slow to deploy, given the uncertain nature of new and often unconventional threats. \n \n \"The general philosophical shift you see in PDB 753 and the Pentagon's transformation efforts is from a military that is overinvested in dealing with conventional threats and underinvested in preparing for unconventional threats,\" said Michele Flournoy, a defense analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former official in the Clinton Pentagon. Such an approach will inevitably hit the conventional forces of the Air Force and Navy hardest, she says. \n \n In part, the proposed changes attempt to make a \"transformational\" virtue out of the necessity of shifting funds and priorities to Army forces that are bearing the brunt of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Dov Zakheim, who retired last year as the Pentagon's comptroller and chief numbers cruncher, says that the pressures that federal deficits are exerting on Defense budgets are compounded by the fact that the Defense Department will spend roughly $12 billion more in Iraq this year than officials anticipated just one year ago. The White House indicated this week that it will request an $80 billion supplemental funding bill to cover the costs of ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Even given that infusion of money, the strains of those two wars have largely taken off the table any cuts to the personnel or operations- and-maintenance accounts, two traditional \"bill payers\" in times of austerity. \n \n \n \"With the Army totally enmeshed in Iraq, and those accounts off the table, that forces budget-cutters to look at Air Force and Navy acquisition programs, which is what they clearly did,\" Zakheim said, speaking at a recent forum hosted by the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. \n \n Even given an increasingly tight budget environment, however, Zakheim believes that the cuts faithfully reflect Rumsfeld's transformation priorities. \n \n The transformation programs \"have not only been funded, but in many cases, boosted,\" Zakheim said. Those programs include unmanned aerial vehicles such as Global Hawk; the Army's lighter, more-mobile Stryker brigades; the airborne laser; space-based radar; the military's global information grid; the conversion of Trident nuclear-missile submarines to cruise-missile platforms; and the Pentagon's Joint Readiness Training Center. \"All of those programs are ongoing, and they are changing the way the U.S. military trains, equips, and fights -- big-time.\" \n \n What is missing from the Pentagon's transformation initiative, critics contend, is a full and open debate about the risks versus rewards inherent in such a radical restructuring. Partly, that is because the Republican-controlled Congress has shown little inclination to exercise strict oversight of the Defense Department during a time of war. For their part, OSD officials have persistently pushed the U.S. military down the path toward supposed \"transformation\" -- without describing what the ultimate \"Promised Land\" will look like. \n \n \"I think OSD has been very relaxed about telling people where transformation is headed, because it is convenient for them not to be tied down to details that could later be used to hold them accountable. But that makes it difficult, if not impossible, for Congress to conduct meaningful oversight,\" said Ronald O'Rourke, a longtime naval expert at the Congressional Research Service. From an analysis of PBD 753 and Navy shipbuilding schedules, O'Rourke believes that one not-insignificant detail implied in current plans is that a \"transformed\" Navy is likely to be the smallest naval force the United States has relied upon in modern times. \n \n \"The proposed reductions in Navy shipbuilding begin to make apparent a problem that has been lurking in the wings for some time,\" O'Rourke said. \"Transformation is leading us toward a U.S. Navy that, as measured by ships and force structure, will be smaller than any in our past, and perhaps as small as 100 surface-combatant ships. And because of a lack of detail coming from the Pentagon or the Navy, Congress right now is in no position to say whether such a fleet is adequate.\" \n \n Other critics fault the logic of reducing the Air Force's proposed buy of F/A-22s to save $10.5 billion, given that the service has already invested $40 billion in research and development on the aircraft. If the cut stands, that decision also raises questions on how the Air Force can replace its aging F-15s and keep a state-of-the-art industrial base warm until the Joint Strike Fighter begins to come on line in 2013. \n \n \"What most concerns me about the proposed budget cuts and Rumsfeld's transformation initiative is that they are driven by an ideology that has proven itself out of sync with the actual experiences of the past four years,\" said Loren Thompson, COO of the Lexington Institute, a defense consulting firm. \"At first, OSD suggested that we could transform the military because of a 'strategic pause' that failed to materialize. They initially wanted to cut the size of the Army, before discovering that it was too small for Iraq. They failed to anticipate the 9/11 attacks and the Iraqi insurgency. They've invested a ton of money in space-based sensors when airborne sensors could accomplish the same mission at a fraction of the cost. So the Rumsfeld ideology has not proven to be a good predictor of the future, and I worry that the end state of transformation will be a U.S. military that has a very old arsenal, and very high personnel costs.\" \n\n \n The cuts are hidden behind some \"transformation.\" It's really a gutting.",

   "What they have done above is effectively counted budget provisions below original projections as cuts. This is not the case. \n \n This years military spending is increased over last year, especially ehn you consider that there is already over $100 billion in discretionary spending earmarked for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. That money is coming out of a whole differnt pot, so it is unlikely to have any effect on navy and air force programs.\n \n Most of the program level reductions mentioned in the article seem to be aimed at updating the military to meet the kind of war we fight today. Fighter planes are largely inconsequential. The days when we planned for Russian invasions and massive dogfights are over. The new paradigm is \"Use your multi billion dollar stealth bombers to take out enemy aircraft while still on the ground\". \n \n The F-15s that are so quickly dismissed int he article are still the worlds premier air superiority/multi purpose fighter. True, most of them were originally built in the 70's and 80's. Most army helicopters are over 20 years old. They have been retrofit and rebuilt so many times that you would be hard pressed to finde even a single part on the entire plane that dates to the 80's. Even the airframes have been updated over the course of the years.\n \n Cuts in the F-22 program make sense. Nothing currently flying can match the F-15, nor is there anything currently in development internationally that is likely to. Why spend billions on new fighters when the old ones are still the best on the planet? You order enough to ensure that your pilots get some stick time on them, and your maintenance people are familir with their operation, then you ensure that you production contractor is in line to produce them fairly quickly if they are ever needed (i.e we find that somebody has come up with something better than the F-15.\n \n Flat tops are a fine example of outdated military equipment. The amount of money required to maintain and protect and air craft carrier is incredible (and aircraft carrier has basically no defenses of its own, the defenses rely almost wholly on surrounding it with so many ships and subs that nothing can possibly get through). For all the expanse of the things, they are not all that useful. They are too slow to act as a rapid response platform, no longer useful as a fighter platform since with the new fuel capacities and engines on the F-15 we can land base them and still hit anywhere on the planet, and frankly we have better things to do with all those support ships than to have them surround and protect a worthless floating runway.\n \n People threw a fit when we did away with development on the sidewinder. Then we introduced the AMRAAM and people looked rather silly for being concerned. This is the same thing. Removing outdated, antiquated, weapons system,s or weapons systems that are no longer useful in todays geopolitical climate is not \"gutting\" anything. If you have an old el camino towed off to make room for a new Vette, you have not \"gutted\" your vehicle collection. You have just gotten rid of the junk.",

   "That wasn't from a mainstream source. I got it from the newspaper. Personally, I don't think aircraft carriers are useless. They are excellent force projection tools, and the airforce is going to need an upgrade to compete with future plans. \n\n \n Aircraft carriers are outdated. When aircraft carriers were key to strategic planning, fighter planes had a maximum range of only 600 miles. Now that range is generally 2400 miles, the exception being specialised aircraft (like the navies carrier defense groups. Aircraft carriers cost several billion per year to maintain PER SHIP. Find somebody in the military (any branch will do) who is at all involved in strategic planning and they should be able to get a worldwide force coverage map. We already have fighter cover for the entire world, with the exception of Antarctica and Australia, from ground bases. There is simply no longer a need for air craft carriers. There is a need for subs and surface warfare ships (missile cruisers, etc...). Currently, over half our sub fleet and over 80% of our surface warfare fleet is busy protecting aircraft carriers.\n \n At one time, Aircraft carriers were good force projection tools. They are now just redundant floating junk. Most of them need an out of water overhaul, and they serve no real purpose since we already have arial coverage of the entire planet. \n \n \nThe United States isn't going to created a \"defensive\" military as you think is necessary. The United States doesn't have that mindset, therefore it needs a lot of the programs which ar being cut.\n\n \n Of course not. As George has pointed out, military spending is too important a part of our GDP. The programs are not simply being cut, they are being replaced. For over 10 years they have been working at getting rid of Aircraft carrieres by extending the range of fighter/bombers and building ground based infrastructure to support them on strike missions. We are finally at the point that we can do away with them alltogether.\n \n \nWhat they want to replace the programs with are pie-in-the-sky wanktech robots and other things.\n\n \n Things like the predator, which has been operational for over 15 years, and has just been waiting for enough funding to move it to the forefront of weapons technology? Very little of what they are proposing funding is \"pie in the sky\" andything. These are all proven technologies, many of which passed testing a LONG time ago. \n \n \nBush spends too much with taxcuts. It's not good. I said he's making a \"transformed\" military. I am right. He is. He's transforming it by getting rid of a lot of stuff. How is that wrong?\n\n \n I am not arguing that they are transforming the military. They are updating it. The point I take exception to is where you said:\n \n \nThe cuts are hidden behind some \"transformation.\" It's really a gutting.\n\n \n And\n \n \nWhen you are dealing with record budget deficits, some things have to be cut, or taxes have to be raised. Since Bush has shown his is utterly unwilling to raise taxes to pay for his spending, cuts are going to be required in the military sooner or later.\n\n \n It is certainly not a gutting, nor does there even exist an overall cut in military spending. They are doing away with old and obsolete systems. We do not fund ironclad development anymore either, and it has been years since we funded programs to build a better musket or biplane. We even cut the air forces dirigible and hot air balloon programs!\n \n The new programs are not any cheaper thena the old ones. In many cases they are more expensive. The unmanned ariel combat vehicle program is expected to cost much mroe then the projected cost of upgrading to f-22's. BUT, they are far more useful than F-22's. Already UAV's can take off from the continental united states and deliver a payload to anywhere on the planet. Removing aircraft carrieres in favor of ground based coverage is just one step. For 20+ years the plan has been development of air superiority over the entire planet based in the continental united states. \n \n \n \nWith all the imperialism and far-flung \"spread\" democracy missions you have to go on with Republicans in office, the military is necessary. They will just send a smaller, less equipped military. They will still try to play world cop.\n\n \n I think pinning this on just the republican is idiotic. Un der clinton we went to bosnia (and are still there) and deployed US troops on FAR more \"peacekeeping\" missions than under any republicn president EVER. Averywhere we ever sent troops under CLinton, they are still there (with the exception of somolia, where they were driven out). \n \n You seem to be missing the point. THE MILITARY IS GETTING BIGGER, NOT SMALLER. THEY AVE MORE FUNDING THIS YEAR THAN EVER BEFORE. Just because we are upgrading systems does not mean we are gutting anything.",

   "I don't see any immediate solution to our bloated military. That expansion now plays such an important part in polishing GDP numbers for continued public complacency and we obviously don't have any potential industrial growth to replace it that I feel the administration has a tiger by the tail. SOTU sounded like more of the same, complete with an attempt to refocus the public on domestic programs such as the crazier than a sewer rat SS reform to further pump the GDP with public debt. The administration has backed us into a financial corner where we have little hope of emerging with anything tangible for our massive military to defend.\n\n \n So you invade. Once you have tied so much of your economy in military production, you really have no choice. Hitler did the same thing. So much of germanies economy was tied up in military production and production of wartime goods that he really had no choice but to invade some other countries. I don't think that which countries really mattered. The important thing was that by using the military they could justify continued military spending. Hitler chose world domination as his goal, and used jews as a scapegoat. The US, on the other hand, is trying to hold onto world dopmination, and seems to be using muslims as a scapegoat in a lot of senses.\n \n That was one thing I found particularly amusing about his SOTU address. He was up there issuing mandates to the Iranians. IT is almost like he doesn't realise thatt he time when the US could simply issue mandates to otehr nations is long gone.",

   "I would disagree on your point about carriers. They are still important tools, and the f-15 it is now quite dated and outclassed by several existing designs such as the Su-30 and Typhoon.\n\n \n The Su 30 and the Typhoon can both outclimb the F-15. They are less maneuverable, though, and the weapons sytem on the F-15 is so advanced that the F-15 can literally acquire and destry the enemy aircraft before th SU-30 or Typhoon either one can even see the F-15. In addition, it has a higer ceiling, which means that it can virtually always engage its targets from an elevated position (which is a far better tactic than an attempted dog fight). Regardless of what you may hev seen on Top Gun, US fighter pilots do not dogfight. Even when meeting an enemy head on, standard tactic is to go to the ceiling, then blow your opponent out of the sky before you are even within their radar range. Dogfighting, while interesting and certainly a good publicity device, went out in WWII. Our weapons and tracking systems are now so good that the russians do not even bother putting chaf and flare dispensers on their aircraft anymore. Our wepaons just don't fall for the old tricks anymore.\n \n If you actually looka t what they have done with the money from the F-22 program, they have put towards either UAV programs (which are already proven, not to mention that UAVs ourperform ALL manned aircraft in both ceiling, speed, and maneuverability) and toawards the F-35 program. The F-35 is expected to roll out in 2008 and cost significantly less then the F-22, while still giving a decided edge against anything else in the air. It is expected to be, with the exception of the F-22, the premier fighter until well after 2040. \n \n There is an interesting article about fighter upgrades at http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/VA-news/VA-Pilot/issues/1996/vp960628/06280442.htm\n \n The problem is that even with the amount of money we are flushing down the toilet every year with our military, you cannot afford to develop fully every new weapons platform that comes along. The F-22 is very expensivwe, and has fairly poor ground attack capabilities when compared to even the air combat version of the F-35. \n \n The F-15, F/A 18, and F-16 are designed as bomber escorts. As I said before, dogfights have not been considered a good tactical strategy since WWII. Migs have been faster and more maneuverable than our planes for a lot of years now. It just doesn't matter, because they are not faster OR more maneuverable than our weapons. An F-15 has never been shot down by a MIG. We have shot down quite a few MIGs, though. Soviet combat strategy in regards to air to air combat has for years been \"fly low, fly fast, and try to evade the enemy. If you are discovered, use your superior speed to run\" in regards to fighting US planes. \n \n You may have something with the Typhoon, since its theoretical capabilities are higher than the F-15 and most Typhoons aare flown by our allies, and use US made weapons systems that are only 2 generations behind our current ones. If they every solve the problem of the wings falling off on maneuvers above 2 G's, they may become a threat. Until then, I wouldn't worry much.\n \n As much press as dogfights get, there have only been a half dozen of them (or at least something that could pass for a dogfight) since WWII, and none of them were the aeronautical display that people think of in relation ot \"dog fights\".\n \n The problem is that the military always just has to have the newest and coolest toys. Fire departments are the same way. For a lot of years my father was the fire chief of a fair sized midwestern town. They had half a billion dollars worth of firetrucks, computerised search systems, thermal imaging cameras, all the greatest toys. The busies year they ever had as far as fires in the 15 years he was fire chief was 3 house fires in 1 year. It would be FAR cheaper to scrap the fire department alltogether and just have the city pay for houses that burn down. BUT, you have to have a fire department, and when the fire chief gets uyp and says \"We need 50 thousand dolalr thermal imaging cameras on all our trucks. Wihtout them we cannot protect the public\", the public by god wants to see those thermal imagine cameras funded and on the trucks. \n \n Military is the saem thing. Soem general gets up and says \"We cannot possibly defend America unless we have this ultra coool new super fighter for dogfights\" and people want to see the dogfighting superfighter funded, regardless of whetehr we really need or not, or whether we actually dogfight or not. \n \n One of the biggest argumetns for the B-2 was that with its stealth technology we could hit the enemies fighters on the ground, and it would be cheaper in the long run (despite the multi billion dollar price tag) becuase we could cut down on the number of fighter planes, since the enemies fighters would all be destroyed already. Guess what, we gave them the B-2, now it is time to actually decrease the number of fighters. You cannot have your cake and eat it, too.\n \n Carriers are still quite important. I would like to see some military experts calling carriers useless and junk. Till then, it's a lot of webboard speculation.\n \n \nhttp://www.iiss.org/stratcomments.php?volume=4&issue=2\n http://www.globalsecurity.org/index.html\n \n Both sources are some of the premier military/political sources, and they both disagree with your carrier/F-15 analysis.\n\n \n While I see traditional force assesments on both pages (i.e force assesments regaring traditional tactics), neither page seems to take into account the fact that we no longer use those tactics. The carrier used in the most recent gulf war had over half of its aircraft removed and the hanger space was used to stockpile cruise missiles, essentially turning the aircraft carrier into a floating warehouse to resupply the other ships. Yes, they flew some missions from the carrier, but the majority of the bombing missions carried out where launched from long range bombers. Most of the ground attack missions were carried out by retrofit C-130s and F-117's (also long range and ground based). \n \n Based on our use of aircracft carriers in the last several engagements (Gulf I, Gulf II, Bosnia, etc...) we should just sell them all as scrap. Instead, we are rolling out the CVN-76 (USS ronald reagan) It is an entirely different concept from previous carriers. It is designed as a modular weapons platform and command center (think of it as almost a floating pentagon). It projected cost of ownership is nearly 80% less than current CVN (nuclear powered) carriers. Its ability to launch and support comabt operations directly is actualy diminished, but the Navy is keen to repolace all of their carriers with like models because even the nave seems to recoginise that the new pattern of war fighting does not require floating airports.\n \n The carreir is an essential element when you are dealing with short range planes (whihc most fighters were up until the mid 1990's) and a shortage of ground operation bases. We are no longer dealing with short range fighters, and we can carve out ground operations bases even in the most hostile zone by using our stealth bombers to destroy the enemies air force on the ground.\n \n This has always been the problem with aircraft as tools of war. They are almost impossible to hide and still maintain functionality because they need a big runway, and runways are easy to find. You don't even have tot ake out the actual aricraft, just the big, flat, easy to bomb runway.",
