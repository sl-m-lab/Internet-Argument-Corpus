You believe in Christ, That basically makes you a follower of Christanity. I believe in pagan ideas, therefore I am a pagan (actually neopagan to be correct). We are both followers of religion, regardless of any \"relationship.\" \n \n \nSo some catholics are saved, some Jews are saved, some babtists are, some apolistics, some methodists, etc. There are problems with how each of these religions twist to their own rules.\n\n \n Look at your own. \n \n \nThats why religion is the problem. God knows the heart of every man and who truely follows Him.\n\n \n Question: why does a omniponent being care about tiny peons? emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \nI personally attend a non-denominational church. I don't think that anyone should make any new rules, nor should they add or subtract from the Bible.\n\n \n Good for you. It's still organized though, right?",

   "And there's me thinking the answer was 'another idiot born'. Just as well you are ignoring the issue of Free Will here too. If someone had killed mary's grandmother would they be held responsible for killing Christ, if it were the devil which raped her would she have no choice then but to accept the death and damnation of millions on her hands. Is every action leading to a pregancy completely within the hands of the mother...if not is it really all that different from the examples above...or is there a boundary between acceptble forced pregnacies and unacceptable ones.\n \n Tad arrogant thinking that it is purely you and others who share the faith to have a relationship with God?",
