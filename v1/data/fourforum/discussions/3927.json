   "This thread addresses the intellectually bankrupt campaign of disinformation about Old Testament abominations Vs. dietary rules (kosher food) and often repeated on internet debate forums.\n \n This is a joke for some, but really represents an ignorant misuse of biblical language\n\n \n You are correct. When people try and imply a double-standard about homosexuality among religious people by saying that they've abandoned some Old Testament views (eating pork, for instance) and kept others, they usually show they haven't done much study into what the 'law' in the Old Testament is about and why some things changed with the New Testament and some didn't.\n \n Another thing is that they often try to pit Jesus (whom they typically aren't following to begin with) against his followers by portraying him as this ultra-tolerant sage who would of course have allowed homosexuality to go on rampant, after all, he was about love. But they never seem to note such verses as when he told someone \"go and sin no more.\" Funny that all the words of judgement or things he said about himself as being the way to heaven are unnoticed by these critics. Sure, he loved the sinner. He also told his followers they would be hated and reviled, which they are. \n \n Everyone tries to have their own custom-made Jesus these days, to fit the way they want to live their lives. Even those pro-gays who hate fundies and those who want to change the definition of marriage,everytime they try (erroneously) to use Jesus on his very followers.",

The verse seems to refer to temple prostitution, which was a common practice in the rest of the Middle East at that time. Qadesh referred to male religious prostitutes. (See the discussion of Deuteronomy)\n \n Leviticus 20:13 states: \"If a man also lie with mankind as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they should surely be put to death....\". The passage is surrounded by prohibitions against incest, bestiality, adultery and intercourse during a woman's period. But this verse is the only one in the series which uses the religious term abomination; it seems also to be directed against temple prostitution.\n \n These passages are part of the Jewish Holiness Code which also: \n \n permits polygamy \n prohibits sexual intercourse when a woman has her period, \n bans tattoos \n prohibits eating rare meat \n bans wearing clothes that are made from a blend of textiles \n prohibits cross-breeding livestock \n bans sowing a field with mixed seed \n prohibits eating pigs, rabbits, or some forms of seafood \n requires Saturday to be reserved as the Sabbath \n \n Churches have abandoned the Holiness Code; it is no longer binding on modern-day Christians. They can wear tattoos, eat shrimp, wear polyester-cotton blends and engage in temple prostitution without violating this particular section of the Bible. Although this code is obsolete for Christians, many clergy still focus on those passages which deal with homosexuality.\n \n It is likely that the prohibition thou shall not lie with a male as with a woman came about for one of the following reasons: \n \n Only sexual acts which could lead to procreation were valued as the tribes needed to grow in numbers in order to survive. \n \n Male homosexual sex may have been connected in the Hebrew mind with idolatry. Notice that Lev. 18:2 deals with idolatry. In fact many of the prohibitions in the Holiness Code were probably connected with idolatrous practices, see 19:26-29. \n Women were second class citizens in the Hebrew culture and were generally treated as property. If a man was penetrated in sexual intercourse he was being treated like a woman and so was degraded in the Hebrew mind. The offense was not that this was a homosexual act, the offense was that a MAN was treated like a WOMAN. If this line of thinking is correct it would serve to explain why there is no prohibition against female homosexual acts in the Old Testament. Women could not be degraded by such an act as they were already not held in high esteem. There is a theory that the Hebrew people believed in a perfect order of creation and anything that violated that order was considered unclean or an abomination. A probable example would be that fish were considered the perfect sea animal, hence anything in the sea that did not have scales and fins was unclean. (Lev. 11:9-10) Cattle were the perfect cud chewing animal, hence anything that chewed cud, but didn't have hooves was unclean. (Lev. 11:6). If this theory is correct then the prohibition against male sex acts would be violating the role of the perfect ideal human: man. It would seem to mix the sex role of the imperfect woman with the ideal role of the man. \n Even if the reader disagrees with the theories stated above they should take note that these verses are a part of the Hebrew scriptures often called the 'Holiness Code'. This 'code' is no longer followed by the Christian church.",
