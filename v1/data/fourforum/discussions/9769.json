   "I posted this in the Science thread below just to get some scientific discussion. I'm now posting these links here because they are also relevant to the creation/evolution debate.\n \n This is more research done on the reported T. rex soft tissue remnants recovered from a fossil found in Montana. This new research supports what is now an old theory, that birds are descended from dinosaurs.\n \n From MSNBC: T. rex analysis supports dino-bird link\n \n From Nature: Dinosaur protein sequenced\n \n From CNN: T. rex thigh reveals chicken family ties\n \n From Yahoo! news: Dinosaur research backs link to birds \n \n As pointed out in these articles, there were a total of 7 short fragments of collagen sequenced and then compared to a data bank of collagen sequences. Three of those most closely resembled chickens, 2 resembled several species (including chicken), and two most closely resembled amphibians (1 newt and 1 frog). It should be noted that these comparisons are not all inclusive since the collagen data bank is limited. For example, there is no crocodile or alligator sequences included.\n \n A creationist comments made, with typical scorn, was that this must mean that newts and frogs are descended from dinosaurs. Of course, this is intentional blindness by creationists. It is to be expected that dinosaurs would retain sequences similar to ancestral lineages just as birds (represented by 5 sequences) can be reasonably expected to retain similar sequences to dinosaurs.\n \n Of course the creationists use the standard \"the magic designer using the same building blocks over and over.\" Doesn't hold water because these aren't the \"same,\" only most similar.",

   "the big news here has nothing to do with dinosaurs and chickens: it's that proteins were found in dinosaur bones after supposedly 68 million years.\nFunny. That's not what the articles say. All of the articles pretty much concentrate on the research as significant in support of the dinosaur/bird link. If you had been paying attention, you would have been aware that it had been previously established through other tests that protein remnants were present. Thus, the amazement that protein remnants so old had been found had already passed.\n \nAnd what's so funny about it is I'm sure none of these articles make mention of this being a huge controversy and how it gives ammunition to creationsits [sic]: they just play like dissent doesn't exist.\nPerhaps that is because the superstitious mythology of creationism isn't relevant. The fact that scientists have learned something new and that creationists are frightened by it is of no concern. There isn't all that much of a controversy among scientists. They will, of course, do everything they can in an effort to verify these findings, but science thrives on controversy. And, of course, dissent based on superstitious mythology is meaningless. It actually takes evidence. Something that creationists lack. \n \nHow does protein last 68 million years? Anyone who believes this is out of their mind.\nI guess you weren't paying attention to discussions and didn't read the articles.

Huxley when it was explained to him, \"\"How extremely stupid not to have thought of that!\"\n \n Gould: \"You don't get a new species by mutating the species.\"\n \n The following are from Lynn Margulis book, \"Acquiring Genomes.\"\n \n The neodarwinists' inventive literature and valiant attempts to unite the genetic stability in the unblended mixture of Gregor Mendel's factors to the gradual evolutionary change promoted by Darwin's natural selection were as brilliant as they were incorrect. Pg. 201\n \n \n About random mutations...\"They are like printers' errors that crop up in the copying of books. They rarely clarifty or enhance meaning. Such small random changes are nearly always inconsequential or detrimental to the work as a whole. Pg 15\n \n Although random mutations influenced the course of evolution, their influence was mainly by loss, alteration, and refinement. One mutation confers resistance to malaria but also makes happy blood cells into the deficient oxygen carries of sickle cell anemics. Another mutation converts a gorgeous newborn into a cystic fibrosis patient or a victim of early onset diabetes. One mutation causes a flighty red-eyed fruit fly to fail to take wing. Never, however, did that one mutation make a wing, a fruit, a woody stem, or a claw appear. Mutations, in summary, tend to induce sickness, death, or deficiencies. No evidence in the vast leterature of heredity change shows unambiguous evidence that random mutation itself, even with geographical isolation of populations, leads to speciation. Acquiring Genomes Pg.29\n \n Speciation, whether in the remote Galapagos, in the laboratory cages of the drosophilosophers, or in the crowded sediments of the paleontologists, still has never been directly traced. Pg 32\n \n \n The major difference between our view and the standard neodarwinist doctrine today concerns the importance of random mutation in evolution. We believe random mutation is wildly overemphasized as a source of hereditary variation....Many ways to induce mutation are known but none lead to new organisms. Mutation accumulation does not lead to new species or even to new organs or new tissues. Pg. 15\n \n So I would like to know.....how can you evolutionists possibly hang on to this silly theory? Is it just because you have this burning desire to follow and believe in a monstous non-scientific, non-intellectual fallacy? Why must you delude yourselves? Why must you let the scientific fiction writers influence how you think??",

Everything is buried. No one comes back to live there or do anything. Some archaeologists and geologists come back several hundred years later. Based upon the layers of sediment do they think that peopled lived in the spot AFTER the volcano? No. because all of the tools, bone, houses, etc are below the eruption layer and nothing above. The K/T boundary is the same thing. All of the fossils are below, none above. \n \n \nScience could clear that question up with a little carbon 14 test to rule out recent exsitence:\n\n \n This why we think you're a liar. \n \n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dinosaur/osteocalcin.html\n \n \n\"Hendrik Poinar of McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, cautions that looks can deceive: Nucleated protozoan cells have been found in 225-million-year-old amber, but geochemical tests revealed that the nuclei had been replaced with resin compounds.

   "Pandion...so does the K/T boundary extend to dinosaur bones that are found laying on top of the ground? How exactly does that work?\nAlthough it's been explained to you before, I'll try once more. I'll use little words and some pictures. Maybe we can make some progress in educating you a bit.\n \n Most T. rex fossils have been found in the Hell Creek formation found in parts of Montana, Wyoming, and the Dakotas. Here is a picture of some of the fossil bearing region of the Hell Creek formation.\n \n http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/af/Hell_Creek.jpg\n \n Notice the horizontal bedding planes in the sides of these hills. It is a simple matter to recognize the same stratum in several different hills. Obviously, they were all deposited at once and since then the material between the hills has been eroded by the effects of weather.\n \n Now imagine that you were on the side of the hill in the foreground. Imagine that you are on the shoulder of that hill that extends towards the camara. Further imagine that you encounter a fossilized bone on the surface, and by digging into the hill, you uncover a fossilized dinosaur.\n \n The above scenario is pretty much how any fossil is discovered. Usually, some part of the fossil is eroding out of a hillside.\n \n So lets go back to you on the shoulder of that hill in the Hell Creek formation, digging out your dinosaur fossil. Again look at the picture. In the hillside above your fossil the K-T boundary is visible. So even though your fossil may have been encountered on the surface, due to erosion, the exposed stratum where it was found was deposited before the K-T boundary.\n \n So, yes, the K-T boundary does \"extend\" to all dinosaur fossils since all of them have been found in strata below the K-T boundary and virtually all of them were found because of some sign at the surface.\n \n Here is a picture of the site where the T. rex fossil under discussion was found. You can see the \"dig\" in the side of the hill, and above it, clearly visible is the K-T boundary.\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/attachment.php?attachmentid=272&d=1176564933\n \n Even though the fossils were found on the surface, they are still below the K-T boundary. This is universally true. Dinosaur fossils are always found in strata that are older than the K-T boundary. I am not aware of any exceptions.\n \n Here's another view of the K-T boundary. This is from a hillside in Alberta, Canada (Canada is the nation just to the north if the U.S. Alberta is a Province of Canada that it just north of Montana. Hope that helps.)\n \n http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/06/KT_boundary_054.jpg\n \n And here's another for you. This one is Pompey's Pillar, most famous because William Clark (of Lewis and Clark) carved his name and the date (July 25, 1806) in it. This is just an exposed part of the Hell Creek formation. This is just a few miles to the north east of where I grew up. You can very clearly see the K-T boundary in the side of the mesa.\n \n http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Mt_PompeysPillarNM_BLM_350.jpg/300px-\n \n Now suppose that you found parts of a T. rex fossil laying on top of the ground at the base of Pompey's Pillar, and the rest of it buried in the earth below. Would you think that the K-T boundary \"extended\" to that fossil?\n \n I hope this helps you to understand what everyone has been telling you about erosion. If you can't see the erosion evident in all of these pictures, then you are beyond help.\n \n Please make an effort to understand what has been beyond you to this point.",

   "What I don't understand is how rock can be eroded off of dinosaur bones when otherwise it takes all kinds of special instruments and probably chemical washes to get them off.\nIt is obvious that you don't understand. It is even more obvious that you haven't made any effort to learn. They aren't \"bones\". They are rocks. And just as wind and water carved the Grand Canyon, it also eroded the Hell Creek formation. Check the picture I posted for you.\n \nUltimately it wouldn't matter to you where a dinosaur carcass was found; if it is laying on top of the ground, the ground merely eroded.\nNo dinosaur carcasses have ever been found. Only fossils of the bones and occasionally other trace fossils.\n \nYou have constructed an \"I win you lose\" situation for yourself.\nThat's the way it is. Just because you don't understand doesn't mean it isn't true.\n \nMeanwhile, all logic goes against dinosaurs being old:\nThat remark coming from someone who hasn't bothered to learn what he is talking about. You wouldn't know logic if it kicked you in the rear.\n \n1) numerous depictions of dinosaurs in artwork and oral histories (American Indian)\nThen by your logic the Greek and Roman gods actually exist, since there are numerous depictions of them in artwork and oral history. That's great logic you have there.\n \n2) carbon 14 tests show their bones contained considerable carbon in them and dated them at just over 13,000 years old\nCarbon 14 is irrelevant for anything older than about 50,000 years. Of course, everything can be carbon dated and will return some sort of date. Only a creationist would try to date inappropriate samples - like rocks from the bottom of the Grand Canyon, or TV tuners, or living oysters.\n \n3) proteins and soft tissue found embedded in bones\nIt isn't \"proteins and soft tissue\". It is the remnants of proteins, i.e., short strands of amino acids or heme.\n \n4) science chickens out carbon dating dinsaurs to rule out recent existence\nNo. Only creationists date rocks that are older than 50,000 years. Real scientists don't date rocks at all by carbon 14. More importantly, those fossils are found in strata that are far older than the maximum for carbon 14. Why would anyone be stupid enough to suggest dating a rock by carbon 14 when it is in strata that have been dated to 68 million years.\n \n5) Dinosaur bones found on the surface of the ground\nAlready explained this to you. Hopefully you will actually put some thought into it and learn before you speak again.\n \n6) unfossilized dinosaur bones found in Alaska\nSorry. Didn't happen. Creationists have been claiming this for years and not once have they been able to produce any such bones.\n \n7) Other megafauna were known to live 10,000 years ago (or less)...animals such as super-large beavers, cats, alligators, elephants, dragon flies, bears and people. It only makes sense that these megafauna lived at the same time as dinosaurs (large lizards).\nDinosaurs are not large lizards any more than mammals are hairy lizards.\n \nThe only \"evidence\" you people have is your own made-up version of reality -- none of it is scientifically based: they date the surrounding rock by what types of bones are found in it, then they'll turn right around and date the bones by the surrounding rock........at any time science may pick and choose which one of these scenarios will give them the desired dates.\nNope. The rocks can be and are dated by other methods. For example, the K-T boundary has been dated by several methods so it is logical that anything buried beneath the K-T boundary is older. In other words, more than 65 million years old. Clearly you haven't bothered to educate yourself in the concept of index fossils and relative dating. Let me see if I can explain in words simple enough for you. We know by many absolute dating methods that dinosaur fossils are 65 million years old or more. If I find a fossil of another organism in the same strata as a dinosaur, it is quite clear that it lived at least 65 million years ago. It's not a hard concept to grasp. Try to think about it.\n \nAnd would someone please answer me: alligators lived at the time of the dinosaurs...\nBut not modern alligators.\n \nso how does science know that other dinosaurs might not have lived until recent times?\nBecause no trace of dinosaurs has ever been found that was not in strata that are older than 65 million years.\n \nThe only true way to find out is to look at those bones and determine if there's any carbon in them\nNope. Meaningless exercise. Any carbon would be meaningless because carbon dating will not return a meaningful date for an object older than 50,000 years.\n \n---- but Big Science would never do such a thing...it might destroy their worldview.\nWhy don't you try to educate yourself?",

   "Pandion...so does the K/T boundary extend to dinosaur bones that are found laying on top of the ground? How exactly does that work?\n \n SS: I've also been explained how random mutations get selected, which supposedly leads to evolution. I don't buy that either. \n \n Pandion: Of course you don't. Mostly, it is because you don't understand it. In the words of T.H. Huxley when it was explained to him, \"\"How extremely stupid not to have thought of that!\"\n \n Gould: \"You don't get a new species by mutating the species.\"\n \n The following are from Lynn Margulis book, \"Acquiring Genomes.\"\n \n The neodarwinists' inventive literature and valiant attempts to unite the genetic stability in the unblended mixture of Gregor Mendel's factors to the gradual evolutionary change promoted by Darwin's natural selection were as brilliant as they were incorrect. Pg. 201\n \n \n About random mutations...\"They are like printers' errors that crop up in the copying of books. They rarely clarifty or enhance meaning. Such small random changes are nearly always inconsequential or detrimental to the work as a whole. Pg 15\n \n Although random mutations influenced the course of evolution, their influence was mainly by loss, alteration, and refinement. One mutation confers resistance to malaria but also makes happy blood cells into the deficient oxygen carries of sickle cell anemics. Another mutation converts a gorgeous newborn into a cystic fibrosis patient or a victim of early onset diabetes. One mutation causes a flighty red-eyed fruit fly to fail to take wing. Never, however, did that one mutation make a wing, a fruit, a woody stem, or a claw appear. Mutations, in summary, tend to induce sickness, death, or deficiencies. No evidence in the vast leterature of heredity change shows unambiguous evidence that random mutation itself, even with geographical isolation of populations, leads to speciation. Acquiring Genomes Pg.29\n \n Speciation, whether in the remote Galapagos, in the laboratory cages of the drosophilosophers, or in the crowded sediments of the paleontologists, still has never been directly traced. Pg 32\n \n \n The major difference between our view and the standard neodarwinist doctrine today concerns the importance of random mutation in evolution. We believe random mutation is wildly overemphasized as a source of hereditary variation....Many ways to induce mutation are known but none lead to new organisms. Mutation accumulation does not lead to new species or even to new organs or new tissues. Pg. 15\n \n So I would like to know.....how can you evolutionists possibly hang on to this silly theory? Is it just because you have this burning desire to follow and believe in a monstous non-scientific, non-intellectual fallacy? Why must you delude yourselves? Why must you let the scientific fiction writers influence how you think??\n\n \n Margulis is not the ultimate authority. In fact, her views on this are fringe.\n \n Of course, as you kow, Margulis has also said that the evidence for common descent is powerful and that evolution has, without question, occurred.\n \n Funny how I don't see you quoting that very often....",

   "First of all this was a small group of men and they had no large equipment. They were in Alaska and the only tools they had for excavation were those that they could carry.\nHow is that relevant? You forgot to mention that they were all unqualified amateurs.\n \nThe dinosaur bones that were found were absolutely lying on the surface.\nNo. The dinosaur bones they found were fossilized and found embedded in the side of a fairly steep hillside. The dinosaur fossils were found in a stratum known as the Liscomb shale. They also found other unfossilized bones in strata above the Liscomb shale.\n \n(do you deny that many dinosaur bones are surface finds?)\nPlease try to keep up. I've explained this to you before and now you come back with this same silly assertion that dinosaur bones are found on the surface. They are most usually found eroding out of a hillside. This is, in fact, the case with these bones that you seem so proud of, and it was a fairly steep hillside at that. They were not \"absolutely\" lying on the surface.\n \nI have read nothing anywhere about how what they found was not actually unfossilized dinosaur bones. Can you show me a link verifying this?\nJust as you can't show me a link that verifies that what they found are in fact dinosaur fossils, no I can't. The reason is simple. These people, unqualified as they are, have decided not to allow scientific study of their finds. They decided to \"study\" them themselves. The only information we have are their unpublished personal reports from the Internet and a privately printed book. It's just not science and it's not evidence. Why are they afraid to let some real dinosaur scientists look at the bones? So this claim of unfossilized dinosaur bones is nothing more than unsupported assertion.\n \nYour defense seems to me that they have lied about their discoveries, or at the very least, allowing a lie to continue.\nMy defense of what? I didn't make the assertion. You did. I have been asking you to defend your assertion with evidence. Clearly you can't. You can't because these \"finds\" haven't been submitted to science for evaluation. No qualified dinosaur paleontologist has examined these bones. These bones have not been described and the results published.\n \n What I do assert is that you have been duped again.\n \nPlease back up your assertions.\nI made no assertions.

It's a fairy tale that children want to believe because of the modern day romance with Dinosaurs, but how sad that allegedly intelligent adults are duped by the same fairy tales. It's sad really.\n\n \n Do you realise that ALL of our modern understanding of biology has been informed by, and only makes sense in the light of, evolutionary theory? If evolution id a 'fraud' and 'junk science' then so is ALL of modern biology AND medecine.\n \n Scientists do not work with preconceived goals in mind; no one is desperately trying to 'fix' the evidence to make sure a fraudulent theory retains its standing. If anything, if evolution was a fraud you can have no doubts whatsoever that there would be plenty of biochemists out there who would happily debunk it in order to make themselves the number one leading scientist in the field. \n \n Science is as competitive and ruthless as capitalism; if a theory is dodgy, there will be armies of people fighting to bring it down; if a theory is wrong, it will be discarded as emotionlessly as the market discards companies who provide poor service. Even with a heavily entrenched theory such as evolution, if it has flaws, they will eventually be uncovered.\n \n In fact the whole process of scientific investigation is geared more towards disproving hypotheses than trying to support them. It is the nature of a hypothesis that while it might make sense on its own, the facts which it purports to explain may be better explained by some other as yet unimagined hypothesis. For this reason the vast majority of experiments take the form of imagining how we can disprove the hypothesis, and then carrying out such tests to see if they do indeed disprove it.\n \n And when those tests suggest that something might merely be slightly wrong with a theory, that theory can be changed to accomodate the new results. Sometimes such changes are opposed by the theory's 'old guard' but the new FACTS always win through in the end; Einstein hated the idea of quantum mechanics but was forced to accept it in the end.\n \n We may not understand the origin of life (we have, however, pretty conclusively gone back all the way to before the 'DNA revolution', to the so-called 'RNA world' hypothesis), but evolutionary theory, as the change in allele frequencies in a population over time AND common descent over 3.5 billion years actually has more evidence in support of it than practically any other scientific field, in that all known facts fit with what evolution predicts.\n \n I will now lay out the major evidence in support of evolutionary theory. Thanks to 'Vicious Love' of Internet Infidels Discussion Board whose work I have shamelessly plagiarised. My apologies for the long post, but I rarely bother with the Evo/Creo debate because it's just the same old arguments over and over again, so this is kind of my definitive last word on the subject (even if it is somebody else's original words).\n \n Evidence # 1. The nested hierarchy of species. Now, remember how ToE says new species form. Each one branches off from an existing species. Therefore, ToE predicts that all species will be related to each other, and this relationship will be structured like an enormous tree, with smaller and smaller branches. Many of the main trunks and limbs may now be extinct, but if we find evidence of them (fossils) they should still fit in this pattern, and no other. And we have found that all 12 million or so known species, as well as all the extinct species we know about, are related to each other in just this way. Nor is this an artificial or arbitrary classification system, it is based on objective and measurable standards, and in particular on genetic relationships that can actually be seen in their DNA.\n \n Evidence # 2. Homologies. These are similar structures on different organisms. It's not just that they exist, just that many creatures have similar structures or features, but that they resemble each other according to their inheritance. I'll give an example: Bats, human beings, whales and moles are all mammals, and all descended from a common ancestor. All us mammals branched off from birds a long time ago. Bat's wings, human hands, whale flippers and mole's paws all have the same number of bones in the same arrangement. This is because we share a common ancestor, so that's what nature had to work with and evolve from. Birds' wings, on the other hand, use different bones! So even though bird wings and bat wings look alike, a bat's wing is actually more like your hand than it is like a bird's wing. ToE predicts this and explains why: it's because birds and mammals branched off from a common ancestor before birds developed flight. So, it's not just that creatures share common features, but the exact specific pattern of their similarities.\n \n Evidence # 3. Geographical distribution of species. This is a pattern that really helped Darwin figure it out. Again, you've continents, islands, etc. So say you've got a tropical island off the coast of a continent. What species do you find there? Do they resemble more the creatures on the adjacent continent, or the species on another tropical island on the other side of the world. It turns out that the species greatly resemble those on the adjacent continent, and do not resemble those in the comparable environment on the other side of the world, as evolution predicts.\n \n What you tend to find in these environments is a lot of birds, because birds can fly there. Some of these island environments have very limited species of land animals, and they tend to evolve to fill all the niches there are.\n \n For example Australia. Everyone knows there are no placental mammals on Australia. There are only marsupials and a few monotremes. There are a very few marsupials in the entire rest of the world, such as the possum. Why no mammals on Australia? Marsupials preceded placentals. Once placentals evolved, they tended to be more successful and replace the marsupials, which went extinct. Australia broke off from Asia before placentals evolved, so we still see marsupials there, but hardly anywhere else.\n \n I should also add that with ToE and other strongly grounded scientific theories, it's not the nested heirarchy, not the homologies or geographic distribution or vestigial features or DNA or the fossil record that really counts; it's the combination of all of these. When many separate lines of evidence all support the theory, and are all consistent with it and with each other, especially when they come from different fields, such as geology, physics, archeology and paleontology, that's called consilience. And that is what really nails a theory as being well-supported. We will see that ToE has very strong consilience, which is why scientists rank it as among the best grounded and most certain theories, along with gravity, electromagneticism, germs and so forth.\n \n Evidence # 4. Vestigial structures. Vestigial organs and structures are organs or structures remaining or surviving in a degenerate, atrophied, or imperfect condition or form. (OED) ToE predicts that organisms will retain abbreviated, ineffective versions of organs inherited from their ancestors. There are many of these. The point is not just that they exist, but that they always reflect their ancestral origins.\n A good example are the eyes of blind fish. These fish live in caves with no light, and cannot see whatsoever. Nevertheless they have tiny, buried eyes that fill no function but have not atrophied yet all the way into non-existence. ToE explains that the reason they have them is that they descended from sighted fish.\n Another nice example is that biologists believe that mammals evolved after life emerged onto land. Aquatic mammals such as whales descended from land mammals with limbs. So while whales do not have legs, they still retain vestigial hip bones. On rare occasions whales are found with tiny useless back limbs.\n \n Evidence # 5. The age of the earth. Evolution makes a prediction about it. Darwin realized from the beginning that for ToE to be correct, the earth had to be very, very old. At that time there wasn't enough data to know exactly how much, except that it would have to be very old. At that time and for the preceding 100 years, geologists had begun to realize that the earth was quite a bit older than previously suspected. (These geologists were all Christians, btw.) Between 1850 and 1900, they started trying to use the data they had to make some kind of estimate, data such as the proportion of salt in the oceans and so forth. The leading physicist of the day, Lord Kelvin, used Fourier's theory of heat conduction and innovative math to calculate the age of the earth, based on certain starting assumptions about the temperature of the earth's core and rate of heat conduction, and came up with 100 million years. 100 million years is a lot, but Darwin and his proponents knew it wasn't nearly long enough for ToE to account for the tremendous diversity and complexity of life on earth. Then radiation was discovered in the early C20th, and it ws realized that the earth had another source of heat energy, radioactivity in its core. So Kelvin's calculations were correct, but he was missing key data. Soon after, physicists realized that, because radioactive isotopes decay at a constant rate, the earth in effect had a sort of clock that could be used to calculate its age.\n \n Applying this method to meteorites (because all earth rocks have metamorphisized), geophysicist now estimate the age of the earth to be about 4.56 billion years old, which is plenty of time for the diversity of life to have arisen by strictly evolutionary processes.\n \n This method has been calibrated against several simpler measures, including tree rings, ice cores, and, most notably, lake varves. I like varves because they are so simple even I can understand them. It is observed that two layers of sediment form in lakes each year: a lighter layer in spring and summer, and a darker layer in fall and winter. These layers are laid down in the lake bed. Millions of years later, when the layers of sediment have hardened into sedimentary layers of rock, you can count them. So you don't have to understand any fancy physics at all, you just have to be able to count. When radiometric dating is calibrated against lake varves, they agree very well, verifying the theory of radiometric dating very well. All 4 of these methods are based on sound, simple bases, and all 4 correlate very well.\n \n Evidence # 6. DNA. When Darwin figured out descent with modification, he knew almost nothing about genetics. Although Mendel had begun his work it was not disseminated until much later. Darwin worked with pigeon breeders to understand that practical application of breeding. ToE predicts some kind of mechanism that would account for descent with modification. That is, people observed that organisms reproduce imperfectly, but didn't know why. ToE predicted that some kind of mechanism would be found that would explain HOW offspring come to resemble their parents, but not completely. Over the next hundred years, biologists discovered DNA and how it works. ToE did not predict the double helix structure, meiosis and mitosis, 4 chemicals, coding for proteins, etc. etc., just that there would be some mechanism that would account for these features in reproduction. Because of sexual combination, and mutation, DNA does completely account for this phenomenon.\n \n Once DNA was disocovered and understood, it lent much objective support and clarification to all of evolution. For example, when we say there is a nested heirarchy (evidence #1) we can see that it is not an arbitrary imposition of classification, but can be objectively based on DNA resemblances. It became possible to determine how closely related various organisms are. The work that is going on now about exactly how DNA triggers changes in organisms is very exciting and, like most scientific discoveries, surprising.\n \n Evidence # 7. The fossil record. Bear in mind again that when Darwin first figured this out, very, very few fossils had been found. ToE makes very specific predictions about what kinds of fossils will be found, and where. Now thousands and thousands of fossils have been found and identified. Let's just start with one feature of the fossils that have been found.\n \n According to ToE, at one time there were only replicating molecules, then single cell organisms, simple bacteria and algae, then eukarytic cells, simple multi-celled wormy thingies, simple aquatic life, amphibians, reptiles on land, mammals--in that order. Therefore we should expect to see that the older rocks should contain only fossils of the earlier forms of life, and newer rocks the more recent and complex forms. Further, and most important, we should never see more recent and complex forms in layers of rock that are under, and older than, more ancient and simple forms of life. And this is exactly what we have seen, over and over again, thousands of times. This has been so well established, over such a long period, by so many different scientists, that it is now accepted as a basis on which to build. Therefore we see modern scientists using this pattern as an assumption for new work.\n \n This evidence is so powerful, so consistent with geology and physics, and so extensive, that biologists by consensus accepted that ToE was confirmed with as much certainty as any current scientific theory.\n \n Please note that ToE does NOT predict that we will find a lot of fossils, or that we will find complete lines of fossils for every step in an evolutionary chain, or anything like that. That is because fossils are so rare, for geologic reasons. ToE makes two main predictions about fossils:\n 1. They will appear in the rock layers in chronological order, from simplest/oldest to most complex/newest. (Of course, new layers have simpler creatures as well, but older layers do not have the more complex creatures, because smaller and simpler forms of life continue while newer and more complex ones arise.)\n 2. Each and every one will fit somewhere on a vast tree with thousands of limbs, millions of branches, and tens of millions of twigs. It may be that the supporting branch is extinct, and we haven't yet found those fossils, so there are missing branches and twigs, but the overall sceme fits this tree-like pattern, which grows through geologic time.\n \n You can immediately see how these two predictions are so crucial to ToE over the grand scheme of time. Both of them have been confirmed over and over, in fact, every time, thousands of times. No bunnies have ever been found fossilized in pre-cambrian stone. No creatures have ever been found that could not be placed in time and relationships on this enormous tree of life.\n \n Evidence # 8. Transitional fossils. It's important to understand that ToE does not predict that we will find every transition for every line of descent. The main reason for this is that fossils are extremely rare, due the necessary conditions for their formation. But to the extent that we have been able to piece together such lines of descent, it confirms ToE.\n \n An excellent example: Paleontologists have been working for some time on the transition to life on land. Obviously this is a crucial, very exciting area. They finally figured out where they think this happened--in river deltas. Then they knew what kind of rocks were formed in river deltas, and where. So they went excavating in just those kind of rocks. And they found an example of what the theory predicts.It's called Tiktaalik. It's an amphibious fishy thing. Now these guys have all kinds of technical reasons why they classify it as they do, it has a doo-hickey bone in its ears, and its wrists look like such and such, etc. Too technical for me. But a couple of things about this. One is that finding such a creature was a very specific prediction that ToE made. They didn't just stumble on it or dig any old where. They predicted where they would find it, dug there, and did. And although we keep finding more fossils in this area, more water/land transitionals, and learning more and more about exactly how this happened, we now have a pretty good outline of where different extinct creatures fit in this story, which is cool. Finally, a very important prediction of ToE is confirmed: that life emerged from water to land, and that we can find fossils of extinct creatures on this cusp. \n \n Evidence # 9 Speciation has been observed in the lab. I'll say it again. Speciation has been observed in the lab. The question that ToE tries to answer is, what causes species? Initially, it was a hypothesis: random mutations plus natural selection plus time. But the problem is that it takes too much time to actually observe a new species developing. Now several scientists have had a chance to see new species emerge in fast-reproducing species, such as E. coli and fruit flies, just as evolution predicts. Examples can be found here.\n \n So, without any of the other evidence listed so far, which is more of a circumstantial type, we know that ToE explains the emergence of new species. The only question remaining is whether this process can be extrapolated on a larger scale.\n \n Because all this evidence is so huge, both in quantity and significance, biologists consider ToE to be basically completely confirmed, and no longer research its validity. They now use it as a foundation on which to explore further questions. It has comparable importance to germ theory, relativity, or electro-magnetic theory. That is why it, and only it, is taught in all introductory biology classes everywhere.",

If it does, then I presume it involves absolute adherence to Darwin's work, which would be nonsensical from a scientific standpoint because Darwin's work, while revolutionary, was only the first tentative step into a whole new field of science which has been thoroughly explored and expanded upon, both in scope and detail, in the 150 years since. Calling evolutionary scientists 'Darwinists' is literally the same as calling quantum physicists 'Newtonians'.\n \n \nTo Liminus: awesome post. Even though WW didn't bother reading for comprehension, I did, and I even found that some parts were educational.\n Out of curiosity, where is the original post by Vicious Love? I'd like to see that one as well.\n\n \n My post is actually a cobbled-together and edited-down version of a series of posts made by IIDB poster Vicious Love under the name Radish on another forum called Head2Christ.\n \n I read a lot of the evo-creo debates on IIDB because they have a large number of professionals who post there, including Prof. Per Ahlberg of whom you may have heard. A thread was created regarding a member of this Christian website, Head2Christ, who had expressed interest in learning the facts of evolutionary theory. This was in contrast to the vast majority of the members who are dyed-in-the-wool creationists.\n \n A few of the IIDB members decided to join the site and lay out the supporting evidence. They seem to be pretty pro-active people over there and do this kind of thing a lot from what I can gather. Anyway, this Vicious Love/Radish guy made a whole series of posts which I edited into my above post. You can find them all in this thread.\n \n While the original poster didn't seem to end up any more convinced than he was to begin with, it's worth noting that a couple of weeks later one of the H2C members turned up on IIDB because he had been so convinced by Vicious Love/Radish's posts that he had abandoned his fundamentalist beliefs, and needed help and support with his 'deconversion'! They have a whole section on IIDB for this kind of support, as from what I've read they have quite a few ex-fundy members.\n \n This has always stuck in my mind, so, exasperated at yet another accusation of evolution being a 'fraud', I went to the one place I knew had the best arguments I've seen all in one place. I'm not expecting any deconversions, but I just can't see how anyone can argue that evolution is 'junk science' having read about the evidence for it.",

And yeah, they do tend to do it a lot.\n \n \n\n While the original poster didn't seem to end up any more convinced than he was to begin with, it's worth noting that a couple of weeks later one of the H2C members turned up on IIDB because he had been so convinced by Vicious Love/Radish's posts that he had abandoned his fundamentalist beliefs, and needed help and support with his 'deconversion'!

Most I know have deconverted from fundamentalist beliefs and have come to believe in theistic evolution (I share those beliefs), and a few have even been deconverted long enough ago that they have deconverted all the way to athiests.\n \n I definitely reccomend that everyone at least visit the boards there - there's a lot you can learn, not just about evolution/creation, but also about science in general or about the bible.

   "**\n No, the problem is that you didn't read what I wrote,-- due to your kneejerk assumption that 'darwinism' and 'evolution' are one and the same thing.\n\n Ok, true. In that case, your statement was both semi-accurate and completely irrelevant.",

   "I loved that post you pieced together - great job.\n\n \n Thanks, but it didn't take that long compared to the time the original writer must have spent laying it all out.\n \n I just hope the creationists here read it and think about it. I mean really think about it. And hopefully go and research the 9 major evidences mentioned and discover just how strong the foundations of the theory are.\n \n I should probably have started a new thread with that post, but it's here now. I await responses...\n \n And SP is right; iidb.org is an amazing place to learn stuff - easily half if not more of the threads in the evo/creo section are not the usual debates, they are question-and-answer sessions about up-to-the-minute research in the field. And while that's their forte the other sections are brilliantly educational. Check it out.",
