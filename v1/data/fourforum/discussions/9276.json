Even the Taliban ruled at the whim of tribal leaders, paying tribal leaders not to grow opium with US DEA money. \n \n The US invaded Afghanistan, with NATO recently taking over military command. With 30 something thousand troops, I see it as the usual training ground for special operations contingents.

   "Sorry guys, but you got your history wrong. The USA (meaning George Bush's neo-cons) justified their 'regime change' invasion of Afghanistan, not only by using 9/11, but by claiming that 9/11 was an anti NATO act of aggression, and demanded that the NATO partners agree with them, which, in the horror of that day, and the sympathy they felt for its principal victim, they readily did. Thus at least the Brits and us Canucks were in Afghanistan just as soon as boots hit the ground. I remember this mostly because two guys, boys really, who lived within a few miles of me were killed when a bloodcrazed cowboy of an american pilot , name of Schwartz, nickname, \"psycho\", dropped a bomb on our boys after having been given a direct order by his control to do no such thing, as his target was unidentified. Four canadians, dead, several badly injured. Schwartz was court-marshalled by the US military and allowed to skate, scott-free. Like they always are. Here is wikipedia's introduction to the invasion--\n \n \"The 2001-present war in Afghanistan started in October 2001, in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, marking the beginning of its War on Terrorism campaign, seeking to oust the Taliban and find al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. The Afghan Northern Alliance provided the majority of forces, while the U.S. and fellow NATO members the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Germany, along with Australia, Pakistan, and New Zealand, provided support.\"",
