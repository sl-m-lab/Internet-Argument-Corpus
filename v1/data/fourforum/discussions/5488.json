   "Knockout blow. Time to turn off the lights.\n =========================\n \n Dutch Voters Reject EU Constitution\n \n By ARTHUR MAX\n The Associated Press\n Wednesday, June 1, 2005; 4:56 PM\n \n AMSTERDAM, Netherlands -- Dutch voters overwhelmingly rejected the European Union constitution Wednesday, delivering what could be a knockout blow for the charter roundly defeated just days ago by France.\n \n Less than an hour after the polls closed, Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende conceded defeat in his campaign to ratify the constitution and said the government would respect the results of the referendum.\n \n \"Naturally, I'm very disappointed,\" he said in a televised statement.\n \n The state broadcaster NOS said that with nearly three-quarters of the results counted, the constitution was losing by a vote of 62 percent to 39 percent, an even worse defeat than the 55 percent \"no\" vote in France's referendum Sunday.\n \n Turnout was 62 percent, far exceeding even the most optimistic expectations and a reflection of the heated debate in recent days over an issue that has polarized Europeans. Dutch liberals worried a more united EU could weaken liberal social policies, while conservatives feared losing control of immigration...\n \n (Snip)\n \n http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/01/AR2005060100265_pf.html\n \n ===================================\n The Constitution of the European Union in a nutshell.\n \n 1. God does not exist, never existed and will never exist.\n Tolerance and political correctness shall be ubiquitous.\n All attempts to discredit these values shall be called Fascism.\n Each opponent of the European Constitution shall be called a fascist.\n \n 2. The history of Europe begins with the period of Enlightening. The European Union shall be based on the legacy of the French Revolution as well as on the legacy of ancient philosophers, especially gay-philosophers. Christian philosophy shall be prohibited as fascist and banned from the United Europe.\n \n 3. All citizens of the European Union shall be equal in rights. However, gays, lesbians and transsexuals shall be especially equal and protected. The European education system shall promote these decent sexual preferences. The heterosexual family, on the other hand, shall be fought as noxious and the main source of violence and juvenile delinquency. Children and the youth of Europe shall be protected from the negative influence of their parents. Reeducation for the opposing parents shall be obligatory and free from charges.\n \n 4. Tolerance shall be obligatory for everybody and everything except for Christians. An offence against tolerance shall be called a crime. An offence against Christians shall be called a joke.\n \n 5. The system of democracy shall be. However, European states which do not integrate or tolerate Christians shall be isolated as dangerous.\n \n 6. All religions are equal, but Islam shall be especially equal and protected. Brothers-Muslims shall obtain a generous compensation for persecutions in the past centuries.\n Descendants of those who fought Muslims at Vienna in 1683 shall be dispossessed and their possession shall be given to Muslims.\n \n 7. Free market economy shall be. Freedom of the market shall be controlled. For this purpose, the European Union shall introduce the complex system of taxes, concessions, permissions, prohibitions, etc.\n \n 8. Abortion and euthanasia shall be legally permitted and recommended. The right to abortion and euthanasia shall be the Human Right. Therefore, a decision can be made by 12 year olds. In case of especially resisting Christians, euthanasia may be performed without their permission.\n \n 9. All European Union states shall be equal, but France and Germany shall be given the qualified majority to rule over the whole Union.\n \n 10. Politically correct modern talking shall be obligatory, e.g. not \"Islamic terrorist\", but \"Islamic freedom fighter\".",
