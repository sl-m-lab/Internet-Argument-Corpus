   "Scams like that have been emailed to people all over the world for years. Many of them originated in Nigeria where the language of the \"story\" was perfected and blanketed to many recipients. Any one fool enough to give their personal bank information to someone requesting it by email deserves to be bilked of their money.\n \n These people will use a real event, such as a death they read about in the paper, to provide the background story regarding where the money will come from. The use of real names and conditions of death is part of their attempt to prove authenticity.\n \n I have two rules regarding such things:\n \n 1\n Never give personal info in response to an email request for it. Your bank will not contact you by email. The government will not contact you by email.\n \n 2\n If you ever have to pay a fee to collect a prize, you're not really going to get the prize...you're going to get robbed. If someone says you have won something, tell them to send it to you.",

   "\n 2\n If you ever have to pay a fee to collect a prize, you're not really going to get the prize...you're going to get robbed. If someone says you have won something, tell them to send it to you.\n\n \n There are exceptions to this, usually when the prize has certain conditions attached that make it very difficult to use. I encountered an incidence of this when I was told I had won a holiday, I knew it wasn't going to be all it seemed but I shelled out the 20p for a second class stamp and got the brochure. Turns out I could have the holiday (for a GBP34 \"handling fee\") but I couldn't choose the dates I went. The way they made money with this one was a premium rate phone line to find out the information I got through the post. Most people are too dumb to read the small print that tells them they don't have to use the number.",

   "Isn't it ironic that the asian term for mugging, or robbing someone is to shanghai them.\n\n \n As far as I know, it's not an asian term. It's a western term, apparently originating in the idea of one evening getting drugged and waking up in the morning on a ship bound for Shanghai.\n \n I doubt Asians would use a term like that :)\n \n As for the 419's, it's sometimes amusing to see how they evolve. Wherever a crysis comes up, the letters soon follow. I laughed out loud when I got one from Iraq's minister of some whatever...\n \n Also, I read some funny articles about how people who got spam mails decided to answer for fun, leading the spammer on a wild goose chase. I remember one almost got the spammer to convert his religion...\n \n They really should not work any more, but you know how it is. To send out 5 million spam mails costs you almost nothing, and even if only one in a milion bite for one payment...",
