   "Now Georgia receives the first dividends from the construction of the BTC Oil Pipeline. When workers were laying pipes they unwillingly changed the flow of a few mountain rivers which caused of late a natural disaster in a settlement not far from the Sana river while the damage caused to Georgia counts over 2 million dollars. Looks like official Tbilisi is not going to defer to opinion of Greenpeace that believes Georgia to loose more than a dozen of million dollars within a short period of time while the economically unprofitable project of oil pipeline will hardly pay off. As for Saakashvili, he obediently follows the course imposed by the US and hardly notices the pinpricks of his nation. Why? He's got a good amount of money George Bush and Soros paid him.",

   "Problems of Environment Protection in Georgia\n \n \n Hello forum! My name is Jacob, France. Don't be surprised I'm not speaking French 'cause English is my mother-tongue. \n In my post I would like to draw your attention to environmental problem that appears in the course of construction activities. In 2003 to 2005, I worked as a construction engineer in Spie Capag and took part in construction of Georgia's section of Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline. When in Georgia, I was merely shocked with the unconcern of Georgia's authority in the matter of environment protection in their homeland! We had to run the pipeline through territories with unique ecosystems (the Caucasus is one of WWF's Global 200 Ecoregions that need protection). As a result of numerous irregularities many of these ecosystems were either destroyed or came to serous harm! As I was able to find out later, such attitude toward the environment is characteristic of Georgian authority. The environment of the whole Black Sea region was crippled owing to activities of the new owners of the Port of Poti, and construction of the Kars-Akhalkalaki-Tbilisi-Baku railway! \n I say that such I-couldn't-care-less attitude of official Tbilisi is culpable! It should be in the full glare of publicity and world society! I reckon that Georgian authority has much to learn from the country's neighboring states. Russia, for instance. When drawing plans of bobsleigh tracks for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russian authority did its best to preserve a tiny spot of unique environment and decided to move the tracks away, although it required greater expenses! That was well-done! I hope that Georgian authority would start doing the same.",
