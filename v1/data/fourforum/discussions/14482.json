Marxists want no private property.\n \n The individual's obligation to society\n Libertarians accept no individual obligation to society that society has a right to enforce; an individual's obligation is only to himself. Marxists believe that individuals all have an equal obligation to render to society, i.e., the commonweal, whatever service they are separately capable of providing.\n \n Society's obligation to the individual\n Individuals have no legal or moral grounds for requiring others, by either individual or collective action, to provide them with anything apart from a mutual obligation to respect the rights and property of each individual member of society. A Marxist believes society has an absolute obligation to insure that each of its individual members has all of the material goods they respectively need while no individual has any excess.\n \n Material gain for the individual\n Libertarians want the maximum material gain for the individual that is allowed by unregulated market forces even if the result is extremes of wealth and poverty. Marxists want no material gain for the individual.\n \n Libertarians and Marxists share 5 common positions on the left:\n \n Traditional social values\n Both believe that social values governing things like sex and marriage have absolutely no importance and must not exist because they serve to restrict the personal freedom of the individual by imposing societal norms on them.\n \n Economic markets\n Libertarians want no regulation of markets other than market forces such as supply and demand even though such markets may collapse since the profit motive in unregulated markets may lead to fraud and exploitation of labor, consumers and natural resources. Marxists want no regulation of economic markets because they do not believe economic markets should exist.\n \n Economic planning\n Libertarians want market planning centralized by market forces, i.e., Wall Street's profit margin. Marxists want centralized economic planning done by the proletariat.\n \n Human nature\n Libertarians have the least understanding of human nature. They have a na\u00efve ignorance of human nature in that libertarians believe humans will fairly complete with each other to maximize their individual self-interests. Marxists have the least understanding of human nature. They have a na\u00efve ignorance of human nature in that Marxists believe that humans will freely cooperate with each other in order to maximize their collective self-interests.\n \n Nation state\n Both libertarians and Marxists believe the nation state is unnecessary and should not exist- it is just an excuse to have government.\n \n Libertarians and Marxists share one common position on the right- both believe government is only a source of repression and thus should not exist. Libertarians would turn the functions of government over to the free market while Marxists believe government is merely a tool whereby the bourgeoisie oppresses the proletariat. Government officially does not exist in a Marxist setting, but it is actually embodied in the proletariat, i.e., mob rule.",

U.S. national unemployment peaked at 25% by historical estimates (nobody recorded exact data at the time) and unemployment was found in all parts of the country.

U.S. unemployment was a problem throughout the 1930s- it peaked in 1932, declined some but was over 10% again during the Roosevelt Recession of 1937 (which was sparked by the cancellation of some of the New Deal welfare and public works programs).\n \n \nIf you think the effect on Britain was small you know nothing about it.\n\n \n When did I say the effect was small?

   "Ok, I'll bite. Name a real conservative. (I just know I am going to regret asking you to do that)\n\n \n I hate to say it but Barry Goldwater had this question pegged quite a few years ago.\n \n \n\"The oldest philosophy in the world is conservatism, and I go clear back to the first Greeks. ... When you say 'radical right' today, I think of these moneymaking ventures by fellows like Pat Robertson and others who are trying to take the Republican Party away from the Republican Party, and make a religious organization out of it. If that ever happens, kiss politics goodbye.\" \n Washingtonpost.com: Barry Goldwater's Left Turn\n\n \n Kiss politics & \"a government of the people, by the people & for the people\" goodbye!\n \n Politics is the new religion! \n \n I also like what this guy says, describing what he calls the 'Republican perestroika' phenomenon (from Reclaiming Conservatism): \n \n \n...Holding aside whether these policies would work--I leave that question to the policy experts--such ideas, at least for the moment, have no prospect of support inside the Republican Party, as currently dominated by three key constituencies: the religious right, the neoconservatives, and the pro-business, anti-tax radicals. The age of Reagan, growing out of the distempers of the 1960s and 1970s, gradually produced a Republican Party very different from the one he led to victory. Ever since, the GOP has devoted itself to conducting crusades rather than to conducting the business of politics and government. Gone is the willingness to compromise and maneuver that helped make Reagan himself a successful politician and president. Gone, too, is almost any trace of the moderate Republicanism that, under Reagan, helped check the more zealous ideologues inside the White House. With Bush leaving office, there will no longer be even a remnant of the old party establishment that Reagan married to the New Right. And even some stalwart Reagan Republicans have grown disgusted at what befell conservatism and their old party, especially during the Bush-Cheney years. \"The political movement that I helped to create as a leader in the conservative movement is now in the process of destroying everything it had once professed to believe in,\" former Rep. Mickey Edwards of Oklahoma writes in his new book, Reclaiming Conservatism. \n Close of an Era | The American Prospect\n\n \n How would you define 'conservative'? I like this:\n \n \nFor example, people with something to lose tend toward conservative choices politically as well as economically. Nothing wrong with that necessarily. Just an observation about the influence of Loss Aversion heuristic on actual decision making. We are more apt to endure the status quo, even as it slowly deteriorates, than we are to call for &#8220;radical&#8221; change. Regrettably, however, when the call for change comes, it often requires a far greater upheaval to make the necessary transformations, or, on occasion, the situation has deteriorated beyond the point of no return. In those situations we find ourselves wondering why we waited so long before doing something.\n \n ... The future now belongs to societies that organize themselves for learning... nations that want high incomes and full employment must develop policies that emphasize the acquisition of knowledge and skills by everyone, not just a select few.&#8221;\n -from Thinking For A Living: Education And The Wealth of Nations by Ray Marshall & Marc Tucker\n\n \n imho, a present day conservative is someone who is more likely to endure the status quo, even as it rapidly deteriorates, than to recognize the need for change. Personally enduring the status quo is one thing. Condemning future generations to endure this status quo is another. \n \n There were groups of Native American peoples who believed & were guided by the principle or concept known as 'The Seventh Generation.' They would think long & hard on decisions made in the present day & consider the impact of those decisions on the Seventh Generation.\n \n The focus today is on the immediate gratification or solutions to problems that have been growing for years, creating a quasi political/queasy religious circus-like atmosphere. No amount of logic, reason, or whatever can budge a 'faith' consciously or unconsciously based on a fallacy. One part of the fallacy is that there is some sortof perfect Utopian or Nirvanic solution just barely beyond our reach. \n \n I still have hope the American people will Wake The XXXX Up! C'mon, there's work to do!",

I've been studying the history of Nazi Germany for over 30 years and couldn't possibly remember all of the books I read on the subject.\n \n The versailles settlement - Reparations\n \n The commission set up by the Treaty of Versailles determined Germany's reparations to be $33 billion. $11 billion was to cover Allied material losses; the rest was for punitive damages because Germany was responsible for the war. \n \n However, $11 billion of the $33 billion total was payable over 37 years at 5% interest. The rest would be interest free and would not come due until the reparations commission decided that Germany's economy was strong enough to pay it. But this commission never had any intention of saying this portion of Germany's reparations was due. Britain and France offered to cancel this portion of the reparations if the U.S. would cancel their war debts owed to the U.S. Knowing that Woodrow Wilson and his successor Warren G. Harding did not support the reparations bill sent to Germany (the U.S. did not ratify the Treaty of Versailles) Britain and France wanted to use Germany's reparations to coerce the U.S. into forgiving their own war debts. The U.S. refused, but once the reparations were in place they were modified first by the Dawes Plan, then the Young Plan and finally in July 1931 President Hoover got Britain and France to agree to a one year moratorium on all foreign debt payments- including Germany's reparations.\n \n So don't tell me that war reparations damaged Germany's economy because they didn't do any damage of any great consequence.\n \n \nDo you think the 40% unemployment rate was because people couldn't be bothered to get a job?\n\n \n What has this got to do with reparations payments? \n \n Weimar Germany was broke because of its pervasive welfare state.

Either document your claims, or admit that you don't know what you are talking about. The reparations were not severe and they were not the cause of Germany's economic distress during the Great Depression.\n \n In 1919 British economist John Maynard Keynes declared Germany would be unable to pay reparations (he was personal friends with the German financier who represented Germany on the commission that calculated how much Germany would have to pay in reparations). But many of Keynes' doom and gloom predictions for Germany and Europe's economy were proven wrong by subsequent history. Most historians (outside of Germany) have concluded that Germany could have paid its reparations- it just didn't want to. Germany did not have an economic aversion to paying its war reparations. Germany had a psychological aversion to paying war reparations because the Germans did not believe they had actually lost a war. Not one single allied soldier set foot on German territory at the end of World War I and the Germans were allowed to march a million-Hun army home from the Western Front in perfect order and fully armed.\n \n World War I reparations - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \"...according to the American historian William R. Keylor in his essay 'Versailles and International Diplomacy' from the book The Treaty of Versailles: A Reassessment after 75 Years, 'An increase in taxation and reduction in consumption in the Weimar Republic would have yielded the requisite export surplus to generate the foreign exchange needed to service the reparation debt'\". \n \n However, Germany's export economy would have damaged the economies of the world's biggest exporting nations- Britain and America- so the Allies never had any real intention of collecting Germany's war-guilt reparations.\n \n From the above Wikipedia article:\n \"Starting in September 1930, the German Chancellor Heinrich Br\u00fcning claimed that the reparations payments under the Young Plan were too high, and demanded the total and unconditional cancellation of reparations[29]. Through Br\u00fcning claimed that Germany could not pay reparations because of the Great Depression, his real reason was to seek a foreign policy success that might bolster his highly unpopular government. At the same time, Br\u00fcning started to demand gleichberechtigung (equality of status), that is doing away with Part V of Versailles, which had disarmed Germany. Br\u00fcning never explained why Germany was so impoverished by the Depression that she could not afford to pay reparations, even under the reduced rate of the Young Plan while at the same time stating that Germany could afford tanks, air force, heavy artillery, conscription, submarines, and the rest of weapons forbidden by Part V.\n \n \"Marks has argued that the Germans could had easily paid the 50 billion marks in reparations, but instead chose to repeatedly default on reparations payments as part of a political strategy of undermining Versailles[30]\" \n \n In order to pay for his intended rearmament Bruening had to slash Germany's social welfare budget.",

   "You are confusing process conservatism with ideological conservatism. The two are not always the same thing.\nNo, and in fact they are related.

Now you can divide \"conservative\" up into something like \"fiscal conservative\" or \"social conservative\".

   "Nobody can be a legitimate conservative while being as anti-religion as Goldwater was. No legitimate conservative would reject the stabilizing influence religion can have on society. Goldwater was just a libertarian, not a conservative.\n\n \n Please define 'legitimate' conservative.\n \n I offered a working definition which may realisitically or pragmatically  be applied to various situations:\n \n \nFor example, people with something to lose tend toward conservative choices politically as well as economically. Nothing wrong with that necessarily. Just an observation about the influence of Loss Aversion heuristic on actual decision making. We are more apt to endure the status quo, even as it slowly deteriorates, than we are to call for \"radical\" change. Regrettably, however, when the call for change comes, it often requires a far greater upheaval to make the necessary transformations, or, on occasion, the situation has deteriorated beyond the point of no return. In those situations we find ourselves wondering why we waited so long before doing something.\n \n ... The future now belongs to societies that organize themselves for learning... nations that want high incomes and full employment must develop policies that emphasize the acquisition of knowledge and skills by everyone, not just a select few.\"\n -from Thinking For A Living: Education And The Wealth of Nations by Ray Marshall & Marc Tucker \n\n \n I then offered commentary:\n \n \nimho, a present day conservative is someone who is more likely to endure the status quo, even as it rapidly deteriorates, than to recognize the need for change. Personally enduring the status quo is one thing. Condemning future generations to endure this status quo is another. \n \n There were groups of Native American peoples who believed & were guided by the principle or concept known as 'The Seventh Generation.' They would think long & hard on decisions made in the present day & consider the impact of those decisions on the Seventh Generation.\n \n The focus today is on the immediate gratification or solutions to problems that have been growing for years, creating a quasi political/queasy religious circus-like atmosphere. No amount of logic, reason, or whatever can budge a 'faith' consciously or unconsciously based on a fallacy. One part of the fallacy is that there is some sortof perfect Utopian or Nirvanic solution just barely beyond our reach. \n\n \n You also claimed:\n \nNo legitimate conservative would reject the stabilizing influence religion can have on society.\n\n \n There are many people who still believe it makes sense to create a \"wall of separation\" between religion & state. Mr. Goldwater seemed to recognize what would happen if there were to be a political/religious conversion to the belief system which marries religion & state rather than seeks to create a \"wall of separation.\" \n \n I usually don't look to Barry Goldwater for inspiration however imho, he was one of the first casualties in the conversion. & I love what he said about the military's ban on homosexuals:\n \n \nSome of Goldwater's statements in the 1990s aggravated many social conservatives. He endorsed Democrat Karan English in an Arizona congressional race, urged Republicans to lay off Bill Clinton over the Whitewater scandal, and criticized the military's ban on homosexuals: Everyone knows that gays have served honorably in the military since at least the time of Julius Caesar.\"[46] He also said, \"You don't have to be straight to be in the military; you just have to be able to shoot straight.\"[47] A few years before his death he went so far as to address the right wing, \"Do not associate my name with anything you do. You are extremists, and you've hurt the Republican party much more than the Democrats have.\"[48]\n \n In 1996, he told Bob Dole, whose own presidential campaign received lukewarm support from conservative Republicans: \"We're the new liberals of the Republican party. Can you imagine that?\"\n\n \n Hhhmmm, fancy that?\n \n I don't want to appear as if I'm joining some sortof 'bullying' expedition against you although I would appreciate some sortof answer to my honest question:\n \n Please define 'legitimate' conservative.",

This is why libertarians are not conservatives. Libertarians rant and rave about centralized economic planning when it comes from Pennsylvania Avenue, but they see nothing wrong with centralized economic planning when it comes from Wall Street. \n \n Conservatives don't want centralized economic planning from anywhere other than Main Street.\n \n An economy that is dominated by large corporations is inherently an unstable economy because it takes less to disrupt that economy (think what would happen if Walmart were to go bankrupt). On the other hand, the more participants you have in an economy the more that economy is buffered and the more flexible it is and thus the more stable it is.

   "I recently read a book in which libertarians were divided into right wing/left wing/special interest groups. The Cato Institute was given as an example of a right wing libertarian group. The ACLU was given as an example of a left wing libertarian group. The NRA was given as an example of a special interest libertarian group. All libertarian groups oppose certain kinds of government interference. The more I learn about the recent economic crisis in America, the more I am inclined to think that it was due to libertarianism. Reagan, speaking of the economic problems the nation was experiencing in 1981, said, \"government is not the solution to our problems; government is the problem.\" Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve and big fan of the libertarian philosopher Ayn Rand, thought that 100% laissez-faire capitalism was best for the economy. Democrats in the Clinton administration showed that they could be just as supportive of economic policies that favored Wall Street. Both sides embraced the theory that letting Wall Street do its thing without government interference was best for the economy- never mind that Wall Street's thing was coming up with more and more complex financial products (conveniently called \"innovation\") which made it easier to scam the average joe with limited financial knowledge. A quote by a Bankers Trust salesman of derivatives describing the nature of his job has become infamous, \"Funny business you know? Lure people into that calm and then just totally f*ck 'em.\"",
