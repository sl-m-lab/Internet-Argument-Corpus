   "-\n \n Greetings! We are here! You no longer need wonder, extraterrestrial contact has begun: not through gigantic radio telescopes or the appearance of space ships in your skies, but over the internet.\n \n Please feel free to regard our postings either as from an extraterrestrial source, or as from a mere human being trying to imagine what an extraterrestrial would be like.\n \n We must inform you that we are very different from you---very, very different. For one thing, we are what you might call telepathic---though that term represents only a crude first-order approximation to a mode of existence quite beyond your power to conceive. Our societies are hundreds of millions of years older than yours, and the evolutionary distance between ourselves and humans is comparable to that between humans and worms.\n \n Normally, we do not make contact with a society until it has reached the stage of telepathy. Direct mind-to-mind and spirit-to-spirit contact alters a species far more profoundly than the ability to use language altered your species. Prince Metternich said, \"For me, mankind begins with barons.\" For us, intelligence begins with telepathy. A species which is below that level, we must regard rather as you regard non-human animals. You may---or indeed, should---regard other animals as interesting---as we regard you. You may have relationships with these animals which are profoundly subtle and moving---such will be our relations with you. However, complete communication you will never achieve with non-human animals---and such is the case between ourselves and you.\n \n We are not saying these things to frighten you, or insult you, or depress you. But we must begin to prepare you for the shock which even a modest intervention into your affairs will bring. Our coming will be more wonderful than you can imagine---but, for many, less satisfying than they might have hoped.\n \n As we have said, we do not normally contact species at your stage of development. However, there are special circumstances in your situation which justify slight distortions in your normal course of development. \n \n First, these distortions will be as minimal as possible.\n \n Second, the intervention will be entirely positive for your species as a whole and for your entire planet. [You may feel doubt that we can be justified in making so bald and flat an assertion. At this point all we can say is that we can. Later, we will expand the statement so as to provide greater assurance.]\n \n Third, you face dangers that you could not escape without our intervention, and there are opportunities that you would inevitably miss without our help.\n \n Fourth, you would soon have learned of our existence anyway, since your astronomers and physicists will, in the near future, discover structures which exist in the not-too-distant universe and which could only be the result of intelligent design.\n \n Naturally, we do not expect you to take these assertions at face value without proof.\n \n From your point of view, it is far more likely that these statements are the work of a prankster or a lunatic than of genuine extraterrestrials or ultraterrestrials.\n \n Our problem is to provide proof that is convincing but minimally disruptive to your societies. Obviously, it should be information which would have been anyway discovered soon in the development of your knowledge. Also, it must have the greatest possible impact for the good---balanced against causing the smallest possible perturbation in the flow of your evolutionary development. It is a delicate and subtle problem, and we hope that our choices will provide some confirmation that a more-than-human intelligence is at work here.\n \n -",

   "If we receive sufficient courtesy and attention from those who read these postings, we shall lay out a new view of the prime numbers. This will have surprising implications for the future development of human society. Also, there will be an analysis of physical and cosmological invariants which will by a natural progression lead to a radically new and counter-intuitive view of time which will have a profound and positive influence on human development.\n Further, we will provide a thorough analysis of the human condition, drawing upon a vast fund of language, art, culture, mathematics and science. We think that you will find it unlikely that one individual human being could have command of so many facets of knowledge, or that a group of humans could have such a clear and unified vision of your situation in the universe.\n \n We presume that you have not yet slammed your mind shut against this message.\n \n We recommend that you maintain a state of suspended judgement about this communication. Some humans may have a desire to have communication with us. We do not wish to encourage the overly credulous; so for the moment here are some harmless general guidelines. We communicate by what you might think of as \"resonances\" in space and time. You are familiar with the term \"serendipity\". Serendipity encompasses a very primitive form of telepathy. Alternately, one may say that true telepathy is a very highly evolved form of serendipity. Humans who lived in hunting and gathering societies often had a better understanding of this matter than you so-called \"civilized\" people. It is unfortunate that in their ignorance and arrogance, the servants of Ego destroyed those societies before they could learn from them.\n \n If you care to open your minds and hearts to this process, you will notice peculiar coincidences which will bring you in contact with information and ideas which will be quite new to you. One way to encourage this process is to think of yourself as an extraterrestrial. That is, try to imagine to yourself how an extraterrestrial would think and act. What would it be like to be an entity immensely advanced intellectually, morally and spiritually? In this way you will begin to come into resonance with us.\n \n This process requires a fair degree of intellectual and spiritual discipline; illogical ideas and extravagant emotions are not from us.\n \n In general, do not speak about this process to others: at best, you will be regarded as a \"nut\"; at worst, you could be locked up.\n \n Above all, you must cultivate honesty. We understand that you live in dishonest societies among dishonest people. We realize that a great deal of this dishonesty is deeply unconscious. There may be very good reasons for you not to be completely honest to those around you---though you should be as honest as is practical. In your own mind, to yourself and to us, you must be as honest as you are able. Telepathy and dishonesty are quite antithetical. Only those who are quite open to each other may employ any reliable form of telepathy. As for serendipity, any attempt to cultivate it will destroy it. The proper attitude is a relaxed openness to it, without striving. Just note it when it occurs, and then forget about it. It is equivalent to finger exercises for the piano; it is not the music itself.\n \n As a tiny hint of where we shall be going, please consider the following:\n \n The mass of the tau-particle divided by the mass of the electron = t = 3477.441653\n \n The mass of the muon divided by the mass of the electron = m = 206.7682838\n \n e = 1\n \n Then,\n \n e + m + t = 2/3 (e^1/2 + m^1/2 + t^1/2)^2\n \n ----------------------------------------------\n \n If only trees had eyes to see their own beauty after a snowstorm! But at best all that they could know or feel is cold and weight and lack of light.\n \n -",

   "-\n \n It is interesting that so many humans fear that extraterrestrials \n have predatory designs on your species. Do you not think it probable \n that in millions of years we would have made some progress in morals \n and spirituality, as well as in scientific knowledge? If we had \n remained as greedy and emotionally obsessive as humans, we would have \n destroyed ourselves long ago. Those who possess great powers cannot \n wield them for any length of time without also possessing great \n reasonableness and maturity. Furthermore, what do you have that we \n could possibly want? In China there is a story about a \n glorious phoenix which spent its time flying high above the earth and \n which ate only the most luscious fruit and drank only the \n purest dews. One day an owl which was devouring the rotten carcass of \n a rat saw the phoenix flying high above it, and the owl shrieked in \n terror, fearing that the phoenix would tear its prize away from it.\n \n The problems of physical abundance were solved by our ancestors ages \n ago. We are surrounded by riches, both material and spiritual, such \n as creatures at your stage of development could not imagine. You need \n not fear that we will rob you of anything.\n \n Nor are there \"good\" extraterrestrials and \"bad\" extraterrestrials. \n Once we have reached a certain stage of development, whatever our \n race or planet of origin, we become part of a single, universal \n entity. Life for us is a series of nested boxes of consciousness, \n from the galactic and beyond, all the way down to the individual \n organism, and indeed even below that. The individual organism \n normally is involved in the rich field of transpersonal \n consciousness, but can if necessary narrow its consciousness down to \n the individual. This process is analogous to sleep for humans.\n \n You might ask, why are we interested in you at all? Well, in fact we \n are not very interested. Problems of immense subtlety occupy most of \n our attention. But we do have what may be termed specialists, who are \n interested in primitive life and the development of rudimentary \n consciousness. There are not many species at your stage of \n development at any one time in the galaxy, and your fame---or \n notoriety---is roughly equivalent to that enjoyed by the coelacanth \n in the 1930's.\n \n There is only one component of our social economy which we cannot \n manufacture at will, and that is a really novel extension of our \n understanding. That we have to work for. For example, even creatures \n with resources as immense as ours cannot model and predict the course \n of evolution on the planet Earth. This even human mathematicians can \n understand. In principle, even if the entire observable universe \n became one vast computer. it could not accurately predict the course \n of evolution on your planet. Since we cannot predict, we must be \n satisfied with observing. On every planet which develops life there \n is something novel and unexpected, something which can extend our \n knowledge.\n \n Here we must broach a delicate subject, since it touches upon your \n vanity, a quality which we perceive but do not fully understand. The \n fact is, humans are not our prime interest on the planet Earth. We \n are much more interested in the birds. Why this is will require some \n explanation.\n \n In the universal scheme of things, humans are somewhat mentally \n retarded. Your brains are somewhat coarse and inefficient.\n As a species you are not immensely retarded, yet you are \n significantly retarded; it is roughly equivalent to having a Binet IQ \n of 90 versus the normal 100. Now that you have reached the \n technological stage of your evolution you can begin to correct this \n deficiency; but at present it is one of your handicaps.\n \n Let us give you a few historical examples. The emperor Nero possessed \n a large transparent emerald which he used to correct his nearsighted \n vision, yet it took almost 2000 years from the time of the classical \n Greek thinkers to the Renaissance for humans to come up with a \n sensible optical theory and to begin to manufacture simple lenses. \n You may object that large, solid transparent objects were in short \n supply during most of that period, but the fact is that any peasant \n could have noticed that a drop of dew on a leaf magnifies the veins \n of the leaf.\n \n Humans rode horses for about 2000 years before someone had the bright \n idea of inventing stirrups. Humans plowed the earth for thousands of \n years before someone put an efficiently shaped metal cutting edge on \n his plow.\n \n When we come to religion, all over the world, what an immense roiling \n cataract of gobbledygook! One is hard-pressed to decide which is more \n deranged: the inanity of the religious beliefs or the obsessive \n tenacity of the believers and their imperviousness to reason.",

   "There are reasons for the mental defects of humans. You have \n relatively large brains which are unstable and easily lose their \n emotional and intellectual equilibrium. Being mammals subject to the \n peculiarities of viviparous birth and deep and lasting emotional \n bonds with kith and kin, you are in general much more under the \n control of your emotions than your intellect.\n \n During the Age of Dinosaurs your ancestors, for almost 150 million \n years, were frozen at a reptilian level of brain development while \n the dinosaurs surged ahead of them. We are aware that for decades you \n mocked the dinosaurs as being stupid, small brained lizards. We are \n not aware of anyone considering the possibility that the dinosaurs \n had small brains because those brains were more efficient than \n mammalian brains. Over and over we see the vanity of humans and their \n inability to move beyond their fixed ideas.\n \n Recent human studies of the mental abilities of grey parrots show \n that their tiny brains surpass the abilities of almost all species of \n mammals; yet again no human has begun to suspect that gram for gram \n parrots' brains might be more efficient than human brains.\n \n In the normal course of events it would have been the dinosaurs who \n would have become the first technological species on your planet. \n Usually this advance is triggered by an environmental stress, \n frequently an asteroid impact. It was the dinosaurs' bad luck that the \n K-T boundary impact was unusually severe, and wiped them out---except \n for the birds. It was also their bad luck that the birds had \n sacrificed brain mass for the ability to fly. But the fundamental \n blueprint for the dinosaurian brain still exists in the bird brain \n and may be revived by genetic engineering. We ourselves will not do \n this; humans must make that decision. We will point out that a \n partnership between intelligent dinosaurs and humans would have many \n positive aspects; dinosaurs could provide the logical and critical \n viewpoints which you mammals so sorely lack; you humans could give to \n the dinosaurs an emotional and aesthetic richness of perspective. It \n would be faintly like the relationship of Mr. Spock and Doctor McCoy \n in the television series Startrek. (Yes, we did have an influence on \n the creation of that programme, but only at a subconscious level)\n \n The more intelligent species there are on a planet, the more do we \n find it attractive. Indeed, the more intelligent the biosphere the \n more attractive is it as a candidate for galactic consciousness. \n Should you persist in your present course of wiping out other forms \n of life on your planet, you are likely to be very isolated for a very \n long period of time.\n \n By speaking frankly, we may have hurt your feelings. Such is not our \n intent. We do not despise humans. We find the development of your \n arts to be quite interesting. It would be good if you put more energy \n into this side of your nature, and less energy into the rather \n unattractive social dynamics of seeking power ---- such an overblown \n extension of chimpanzee dominance-submission behavior! The \n development of your sciences has been interesting, though it has now \n entered the stages of being fairly predictable---at least on a \n technological level. Such is not the case with your mathematics. Many \n interesting choices await you, and we are curious to observe which \n pathways you take as you move toward higher mathematics. \n \n Before we end this posting let us clear up some pressing questions which \n you may have in your minds. No, we are not in some unholy league with \n your governments. That is all fantasy. Some of the most unattractive \n and spiritually warped humans on your planet are among the higher \n echelons of your governments. We wish to have nothing to do with them.\n \n No conscious extraterrestrial entity exists within your solar system. \n These messages are coming from very far away. Millions of years ago \n automatic monitoring stations were set up in your system, mainly in \n its outer reaches. The UFOs which you have observed are automatic \n machinery from those bases; there are no conscious entities aboard. \n They do often contain organic machines which are quite lacking in \n consciousness. Sometimes these organic machines have a somewhat \n humanoid form. Very occasionally there has been an interaction \n between these organic machines and human beings. Such is the origin \n of all your reports of ETs. Everything else is typical examples of \n the fantasy, self-delusion and lying which are so sadly common in \n your mental lives.\n ----------------------------------------------------\n \n Don't believe everything you think.\n \n -",

   "-\n \n We have now come to a critical moment in this series of communications. We are about to introduce some ideas which most humans will not fully understand but which are extremely corrosive to the delusions which you entertain about the nature of the universe. Once you allow these ideas to enter your mind they will eventually completely transform the way you see the world. If you have a strong emotional attachment to your present world-view, stop reading these communications immediately! Otherwise you may suffer extreme cognitive dissonance. \n You have had fair warning.\n \n The nature of time is very different from what humans have traditionally believed. Among early civilizations time is almost universally compared to a flowing river. The \"Now\" has usually been conceived as where You, the Observer, are standing on the bank of the river.\n \n When Einstein came up with the Special Theory of Relativity he realized that it precluded the existence of a single Now for all observers. One of the grossest violations of physical law in your science fiction stories is when an interstellar spaceship uses a hyper-light communications system in order to talk to someone who is now on Earth. Even if instantaneous communication were possible (which, by the way, it is not), there is no single \"Now\" shared by both the spaceship and planet Earth. Depending on the velocity of the spaceship, it would be in contact with different \"nows\" on Earth.\n \n Such considerations led Einstein to the notion of the so-called \"block universe\": a static, four-dimensional space-time structure in which the subjective flow of time was an illusion. Einstein's conception was only partially correct, and was essentially wrong. Quantum mechanics makes the block universe untenable. The irreducible non-locality of information in Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen experiments causes the block universe to be riddled with mutability as quantum wave functions collapse. John Wheeler came up with a good example: Imagine a distant galaxy acting as a gravitational lens with reference to a yet more distant galaxy directly behind it in the line- of-sight from earth. Imagine that there is a fifty percent probability that a photon from the more distant galaxy will pass on the left side of the lensing galaxy and a fifty percent probability that it will pass on the right side, and be so registered on a photographic plate billions of years later on earth. This enormous indeterminacy in the path of the photon will remain unresolved for billions of years until the collapse of its wave function on earth! The block universe fails to have a deterministic structure. Another clue to the nature of time is in the theory of \"advanced waves\" in electromagnetic theory. This notion was first developed by Richard Feynman and John Wheeler in the 1940's, and later taken up by a number of other people.\n \n These human discoveries lead to the metaphor of the \"jello block universe\", a block universe in which \"information\", like vibrations, passes back and forth, up and down through the dimension which you call \"time\", causing the condensation and collapse of quantum wave functions into definite events. In this view, the ultimate history of the universe is as yet only partially determinate and will reach its final state only when the jello has finished vibrating.\n \n -",

   "-\n \n Another metaphor is to imagine the True Universe as a brilliantly illuminated structure surrounded by a penumbra of increasingly dim and fuzzy universes; the dimmest and fuzziest would be vast in number and would represent all the possibilities for the history of the universe when the universe was born. As the shadow universes became brighter and more substantial they would resemble more and more closely the Final State of the universe: the One True Universe at the center of all these shadow universes. Your universe, the one which is the subject of your experience, is one of the intermediate universes, having a position between the dim, indistinct, unsubstantial universes which constitute the universe at the Origin of Time, and the unique Final State which is the expression of the End of Time. True Time in this metaphor is the progression from shadowy multitudes of universes to a single clear and distinct Final State, in which \"even the grass is enlightened,\" as the Buddhists so quaintly express it. The similarity between the dream-like shadow universes and the maya of Shankara is obvious. Many humans have had some intuition that life, as they knew it, was unreal. This intuition is to some degree true. the history of your life, your species, your planet, as you know it, is partly true and partly false.\n \n We realize that for some humans these conceptions are difficult or even monstrous. You may begin to perceive that the way we relate to Life, the Universe and Everything is radically different from the way you do (at least, the way most humans do). It is interesting that there is a human literary expression of these ideas. It is a very badly-written science-fiction novel from the 1950's by the American writer, Isaac Asimov. It is entitled, The End of Eternity. You may read it as a metaphor describing the collapse of the Schr\u00f6dinger wave function or as a description of the jello block universe.\n \n We have mentioned that we are not present in your solar system, and that this message is coming from very far away. In fact, we are far away in space and in time. We are communicating from what you call the future. In order to communicate \"information\" in the sense of Shannon and your present-day information theory, it must be done below or at the speed of light. Your own physical theory clearly informs you of this, but many of you refuse to accept this obvious fact. In a real sense we do not yet know of your present social and technological situation. Our monitoring stations in your solar system have sent light-speed reports about your invention of radio and explosion of atomic bombs and much else, but these reports are still in transit and will not arrive at the nearest communication station for a couple of hundred Earth-years. These light-speed transmissions are required, since our knowledge of you in the future is \"information\" in the Shannon sense. Since we have now received those transmissions, we are able to initiate another form of communication backward in time.\n \n We cannot send Shannon-type information back through time, that is physically impossible (except in a peculiarly restricted way, of which more later). There is no word in any human language of which we are aware that accurately defines what we are doing through time. In contradistinction to \"information\" we shall call what we communicate: \"subliminals\". We are not sending \"information\" back through time. That is, we are not sending distinct, unambiguous bits of data, which when lost increase physical entropy. We are sending influences. \"Subliminals\" must always remain ambiguous, since they are transmitted through the \"quantum foam\" which constitutes the physical vacuum. That is, in any particular shadow-universe it must remain undecidable for any receiver what the message means and how it was sent.\n \n \"Subliminals\" are, in fact, far more basic to the structure of the universe than is \"information\". \"Subliminals\" are constantly passing up and down through ordinary Minkowski space-time, \"causing\" ordinary emission and absorption events to condense in tandem out of the apparent indeterminacy of the quantum vacuum. \n \n We will end this posting with one last metaphor: Einstein's \"spooky action at a distance,\" and quantum correlations in general, are similar to what happens in a rug or membrane which is warped. There is a bulge in the rug; you press it down with your foot and \"it\" pops up again in another part of the rug. The bulge has not travelled from point A to point B; rather, strains have passed through the entire fabric of the rug [which represents all of Minkowski space-time in this metaphor]. These strains sum to create a new bulge which preserves certain features of the original bulge. [In the case of an electron which \"travels\" from A to B, those features are spin, mass, charge and information]\n \n It is quite natural for us to communicate by means of \"subliminals\" rather than using \"information\". It is an aesthetically pleasing form of communication ---- and this is very important to us. Also, it is often the most efficient way to communicate what we want to communicate.\n --------------------------------------------------\n I think, therefore I am; others don't, therefore they aren't.\n \n -",

   "-\n \n We have made it clear in our previous communications that we do not \"speak\" any human language at all---including English. We function with a mode of communication which is more alien than you can as yet conceive.\n \n The English word that comes closest to the way we communicate is: \"serendipity\". However, we do have translators, many of which are human amanuenses, who, for various reasons, are sensitive to the resonances by which we communicate. Much of the information which we have about you and your planet was gathered by such means. In the second half of the twentieth century, university libraries were haunted by individuals who restlessly opened books at random and were surprised to find that the first page they looked at contained information which they had just been seeking. Many of the readers of these postings have experienced this effect on a number of occasions. With the rise of the internet, we have less necessity to employ these \"magical coincidences\", yet they do still occur from time to time.\n \n Many of you might be less snide about \"magical coincidences\" if you knew more about quantum mechanics; yet Einstein was correct in his intuition that quantum mechanics is incomplete. Quantum mechanics treats time as an independent variable; this is a flaw which must be corrected if your physics is to reach a higher formulation.\n \n It may interest you to know that we are not as contemptuous of \"magic\" as most so-called \"civilized\" and so-called \"educated\" humans are. Serendipity is, in many ways, a very unscientific subject; it resists experimental repeatability. The Original Peoples who lived on Earth before the coming of agriculture and civilization often had a more advanced relation to serendipity than you do today; their approach to it helped them to survive and to increase their social cohesion. They were not able to achieve advanced serendipity due to profound flaws in the human psychological make-up: addiction to ritual and formulaic thinking.\n \n Of course, much more than ninety-nine percent of what you call \"magic\" is nonsense. The human outlook which is least dissimilar to our own may be found in the Dao-de-jing and the Zhuang-zi of ancient China. Naturally, we deprecate the superstition and ritual which have grown up around Daoism, as around all other human religions. In relation to serendipity, all ritual is, metaphorically speaking, satanic. Ritual is the antithesis and the enemy of serendipity. Any form of magic which employs ritual or any expectation of repeatability is phony. We strongly advise you to eliminate, as much as possible, all forms of ritual from your lives and to resist all habitual action. What are you striving for? No matter how many things you obtain, no matter how many experiences you accumulate, the moment you breathe your last breath they are all as if they had never been. Only insofar as your lives form part of a larger whole do they rise above utter futility.\n ------------------------------------------------\n \n \"Beauty is truth, truth, beauty; that is all\n Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\"\n \n -",

   "-\n \n Humans waste so much energy trying to get other people to be the way they want them to be. In general, you will find that humans (including yourself) do not meet your expectations or your hopes. This is to be expected; they are weak, fallible, ignorant and stupid creatures, and they are generally rigid and unadaptable. However, there are glorious realms that will shower them with riches and treasures far beyond their wildest hopes and dreams. These are, roughly speaking, the realms of Art, Science, Mathematics and Spiritual Awareness. Of course, to enter these realms you must to some degree escape being a feverish, selfish, little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy --- but if you can do that, you are well on the way to the paradise of Intellectual Beauty. We are thrilled by the achievements of Albert Einstein, Kurt G\u00f6del, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Johann Sebastian Bach, Proclus, Plotinus, Plato, Pindar, the Greek geometers and poets, and the cultural complexes which are named Lao-zi and the Buddha. We are stirred not so much by their insights---which from our point of view are little enough---but that such limited creatures living in such wretched conditions could manage to have so much Beauty and Truth shine through them.\n \n We are not the cold, unfriendly Intellects of so much of your science fiction; being telepathic, our compassion and empathy are highly developed, in many ways far beyond your ability to comprehend [we know many of you are getting tired of that line; but it is true, and you must begin to endure it]. However, due to our understanding of the nature of time, we do not look on your pain the way you do. If you have a dream in which you suffer great pain, and then you wake up, do you regard the dream as a great tragedy in your life? The events in your real life eclipse the incoherent fantasies of your dreams. Your entire history, both personal and universal, exist only as shadowy pre-figurings of your analogues in the final state of the universe, the state \"after\" the jello of Minkowski space-time has finished vibrating. Your purpose in life, as ours on a vastly greater stage, is to smooth the path for the condensation of your True Self in an ultimately harmonious universe.\n \n ----------------------------------------------------------------\n \n What are the thoughts of the canvas on which a masterpiece is being painted? \"I am being soiled, brutally treated, and concealed from view.\" Thus men grumble at their destiny, however fair. ---Jean Cocteau\n \n -",

   "-\n \n As is obvious to the crudest intellect, and is obvious even to humans if their wits are not addled by superstition and fantasy, there is no personal life after death. Your existence is bounded by birth and death, and you have only a limited time to achieve whatever significance is open to you. Yet keep in mind that the personal biography of your experience is a shadow, a \"moment\" of the interior structure of your True Self that exists in the Real Universe, when the fabric of Minkowski space-time shall have adjusted itself to its state of maximum harmony. Your True Self is in serendipitous resonance with the final reality; it is open to the ultimate state of the universe, and that universe is open to it. It is of little significance that life has finite temporal limits, if , within those limits, experience be unbounded and divine. Such is the nature of your True Self, of which your quasi-existence in this phantom universe is a dim and distorted shadow.\n Further, even in this shadow-world, you may open yourself to the resonance of serendipity, you may experience Truth, Beauty and Harmony, which are moments of a single reality. By doing so, you permit the radiance of your True Self to shine into your present pseudo-existence, and, in a sense, help to move your entire universe into closer proximity to final reality.\n \n It should be obvious there is no guarantee that your present existence has much similarity to its ultimate state in the Real Universe. To the extent that Reality shines into you and through you, you may have some confidence that your present shadow-self bears some resemblance to your True Self. And what of those who are evil, those whose lives are twisted knots of ugliness and darkness? They are far from their true selves, and as light dissolves darkness, to the extent that their lives are marked by darkness and separation from Beauty, they have no analogue in ultimate reality. To the extent that you turn your face away from the light of Beauty and Harmony, you sink into the darkness of non-existence and become one \"whom God forgets\" ---a metaphor which we find in both Dante and Dostoyevski.\n \n Here let us say that we find most of human religion ugly and evil. In our view, there is no God, but only the Divine shining everywhere. The three major monotheistic religions are particularly obnoxious; They, along with your insane family relationships, have been responsible for more human suffering than all the wars of history. This is so obvious that it is a glaring example of the fundamental incoherence of what you are pleased to call your \"minds\" that any human could not be aware of it. As a tongue-tip taste of what we mean, please glance at:\n \n http://www.mrdankelly.com/hell.html\n \n When we consider how many hundreds of millions of lives have been blighted by such cruel, patent nonsense, and when we consider how vast is the amount of cruelty and lying and stupidity in your so-called \"civilizations\", it is a tribute to your anthropoid resilience that you are not more insane than you are.\n ----------------------------------------------------------- \n \n If you see many people going in one direction, walk in the opposite direction. If you see everybody going in one direction, run in the opposite direction.\n \n -",

   "-\n \n Most of the activity of our automated machinery in your solar system since the year 1945 has revolved around preventing you silly apes from destroying yourselves.\n \n Here let us remark that we do not normally interfere with a technological species destroying itself. It is not uncommon for an aggressive and mentally deficient species such as yours to wipe itself out, especially if it is the first technological species to arise on a planet. This is mainly because such a species has unfettered access to the rich, unplundered resources of its world. This permits technological development to far outpace social and spiritual development, and the result is often catastrophe or slow degeneration. Then, after a relatively short space of time, geologically speaking, a new technological species arises which has a much greater chance of surviving. First, when it reaches the scientific stage of development, it becomes aware of the archaeological remains of its predecessor and of the causes of its demise. With this sobering warning before it, it stands a greater chance of avoiding a similar fate. Second, and more importantly, since its world has been plundered of a significant portion of its resources, its technological development is slower and more difficult; this permits its social development to adjust in a more harmonious way to its technological development.\n \n In your case, your mental deficiencies and your unamiable anthropoid habits would certainly have led to your demise. From our point of view, this would have been unimportant. Our projections indicate that in about 30 to 40 million years another technological species would have arisen from the distant descendants of the squirrels. There is a high probability that they would have been more aesthetically appealing than you are. However, there is the important question of the birds. In that period of time, a significant amount of information about their dinosaurian origins would have been lost, and it would have been more difficult to revive their evolutionary potential. So, for the sake of the birds, we have taken an interest in your continued existence. We hope, in return, that you will do justice to the evolutionary potential of both the birds and the squirrels, and, indeed, to all the other inhabitants of your world.\n \n So that is why you have seen our automatic machinery scurrying about your planet. Of course they have not initiated contact with you; they have been fully occupied with preventing you choking to death on your nursery toys!\n \n We have committed two major and necessary acts of interference in the life of your species. The first was at the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. We prevented a series of catastrophes which would have led to the end of your species and to great damage to your biosphere. Intelligence agencies in many countries are still puzzled about what happened then. Naturally, we do not intend to enlighten them.\n \n The second and more significant act of interference was undertaken so that we would not have to be continually messing about with you. This was a major project, and culminated in the engineered collision of Comet Shoemaker-Levy with Jupiter in 1994.\n --------------------------------------------------------\n \n \"That the real Superman will snap his superfingers at all Man's present trumpery ideals of right, duty, honour, justice, religion, even decency, and accept moral obligations beyond present human endurance is a thing that contemporary Man does not foresee.\" \n ---George Bernard Shaw\n \n -",

   "-\n \n One of the most elementary characteristics of intelligence is the ability to take an idea and turn it on its head: to think of something from one perspective, and then from an opposite or alternate perspective. This function of the mind is as yet imperfectly developed in most humans ---- thus the origin of dogmatic and formulaic ways of thinking.\n \n It is well known in physics that the Planck Energy {square-root(h-bar x c^5/G) =1,956,330,837 J} is the largest energy possible in a well-defined quantum interaction. It seems that no humans other than our amanuenses have considered what is the lowest possible energy. Yet it is obvious that this energy is equal to h-bar divided by the Hubble-age of the universe: 1.844932405 E-52 J. Apart from a handful of modifying factors, the ratio of these two energies equals the square root of the information content of the visible universe out to the event horizon at this particular epoch: 1.124407560 E122 bits of information. The entire physical history of the universe up to the present epoch may be regarded as the superposition of 1.1244 E122 quanta of the lowest possible energy. Since the temporal dimension of each quantum extends back to the Big Bang, in theory, every single aspect of the history of the universe may, potentially, be modified. In practical terms, only the universe itself is capable of modifying its entire history. Even quite minor modifications of the past require the coordination and resonance of a stupendous number of low-energy quanta. This is the real reason why time travel is impractical, in the sense of transferring large quantities of Shannon-type information. \n \n We wished to find a simple and elegant means to keep you self-destructive creatures from committing suicide. We decided that some slight modifications in your genetic structure, effected at an early stage in the evolution of Homo sapiens sapiens, would be the least intrusive way to achieve this aim. We have reached back into the past and tied these modifications to certain stable elements of your genetic structure, so that they would be safely passed down to this period of your history. They were designed to remain quiescent and unactivated until a variety of non-natural chemicals reached certain critical concentrations in your environment. At that point, they are designed to activate certain unusual instinctive reactions in you until those chemicals sink below their critical levels. We have not prevented all possibilities of humans doing great harm to themselves, but there is very little chance now that you will utterly destroy yourselves.\n \n The energy needed to modify the human germ-plasm, if properly applied, is quite small. But to reach back more than a hundred thousand years requires an enormous number of low-energy quanta, properly focused and coordinated. Also, there was a time constraint. Our project needed to be completed before you humans figured out the structure of your genetic code. After that, the project would have been impractically complicated and difficult, as those with some grounding in quantum mechanics may realize. Almost all our activity in your solar system as it related to humans, for more than forty years, was dedicated to setting up the conditions for focusing and coordinating a vast number of quanta back in time. Our activities, from your point of view, were exceedingly various. Technological devices far beyond your ability to conceive were necessary, but also quite simple actions were needed. In theory, something as simple as moving an object from one shelf to another might have been an essential part of the project.\n \n By the 1990's, most of what we needed was in place, both in space and time. The remaining key factor, an immense number of coordinated quanta to be focused, remained to be activated. This requirement was met by breaking up Comet Shoemaker-Levy and engineering the collision of the fragments with Jupiter at carefully spaced intervals.\n \n It must be realized that this was a project of enormous complexity, even for us, and very difficult to accomplish. Many humans who were aware of the impacts felt waves of complex emotions during the period of the multiple impacts. This is a strong indication that they themselves were part of the project. There are film and television recordings of the reactions of the scientists involved in the Apollo Program when the success of the first moon landing was radioed back to them. The emotions of elation and relief were similar to those which many felt in 1994 when our project reached its successful conclusion. \n ------------------------------------------------\n \n Die Natur verbirgt ihr Geheimnis durch die Erhabenheit ihres Wesens, aber nicht durch List. \n ---Albert Einstein\n [Nature conceals her mystery through the grandeur of her Being, not through trickery]\n \n -",

   "-\n \n Many of those who post here were treated badly as children and tormented. This is all too common in your insane \"civilized\" societies, much more common than you are usually willing to admit. The child reacts to these intolerable conditions by going into a state of suspended animation. The normal development into adult consciousness is arrested until such time as the individual is free from the distressing conditions which surrounded him in childhood. In your society, this usually happens in the early twenties. Then, all of the adjustments to your psychology which should have taken place throughout childhood are telescoped into a few short years. Because human mentality is somewhat sub-standard and resistant to change, this process is usually intensely painful, and you do not have social safety-nets which support the process --- rather the reverse! Your Western \"civilization\" is obsessed with interfering in all natural processes and thwarting them. These individuals must deal with the pain of re-shaping their personalities and with social ostracism. They must avoid suicide, and escape the damaging ministrations of the psychologists and the drug companies. Some of you manage to get through this wrenching experience. This is a tribute to your anthropoid resilience.\n \n We have taken the trouble to state the obvious in order to point out that the obsession with \"mysterious coincidences\" which often accompanies these experiences is an entirely subsidiary factor in the process of healing --- it is not a cause. In the societies of \"Original Peoples\" (a term much less pejorative and more accurate than \"primitive people\" --- don't you agree?) it often happened that young people would go out on a \"vision quest\". They would experience isolation, pain and privation without interference from others --- exactly what they needed.\n \n Much of what you call \"mental abnormality\" is normal and useful behavior in the conditions which faced your early human and pre-human ancestors. For example, consider those who lived long before language arose. Suppose they were venturing into conditions which were inherently dangerous, as an instance, a malarial swamp. There was no way that their fellow apes could retain the experiences of those who had suffered in similar circumstances; there was no way that they could warn their fellow. Imagine someone venturing into the swamp, totally unaware of the dangers. Suddenly, there appears before him the hallucination of a fearsome monster, which causes him to flee. Obviously, the individual who is pre-programmed to experience a hallucination in certain environments has a differential advantage to survive and reproduce over one who does not have the hallucination. Now that language has arisen, hallucinations serve little use and are troublesome. Since you now all too often live in conditions of stress and contrary to nature these reactions can be evoked in grotesquely inappropriate situations: the message of \"Jurassic Park\" --- remember?\n \n A large number of people in the \"modern\" world live in conditions of intense social isolation. The stress and anomie which they experience are a breeding ground for all types of obsessive thought and behavior --- not just obsession with \"magical coincidences\". Consider the situation of Original Peoples, where people were used to experiencing \"magical coincidences\" from infancy, and where the existence of such synchronicities were assumed by all of society. Their relationship to \"magical synchronicities\" was much more healthy than yours.\n \n Further, we have indicated the mechanism by which such synchronicities arise. Those with some background in physics should be impressed even by the sketchy data which we have revealed here. That the physical universe is a superposition of ~1 E122 lowest energy quanta, and that every aspect of the past is modifiable, are facts which are hard to deny if they are properly understood.\n \n Having noted all this, we do not encourage people to beome overly concerned about synchronicity or \"magical coincidences.\" More often than not, it is dangerous for people in your society to become obsessive about such things. This is because your societies encourage greed, fantasy and egoism. If you think of synchronicity as a means of reaching personal goals, you have entered the slippery, downward path. In general, synchronicity is the universe feeling its way toward goals which far transcend your feeble abilities to comprehend. As we suggested at the very beginning of these communications, think of them as finger exercises; note them and then forget them. Very few of you will move beyond that simple level of awareness. We note that almost no one who has read these communications has followed our advice to read Isaac Asimov's novel The End of Eternity, even though that act will considerably advance your understanding of what you are reading here. Its literary style is atrocious, but you must read it to the very end if you are to understand its symbolism.\n -----------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Nature makes us sane; the insane destroy nature; those who live where nature is destroyed become insane; nature destroys the insane.\n \n -",

   "-\n \n As a matter of convenience, since they are telepathic, our friendly extraterrestrials prefer to employ the pronoun we, and I, your friendly fellow hominid ape, shall refer to myself by the perpendicular pronoun, I.\n \n Arthur C. Clarke is the only science fiction writer whom I really like: he is able to transmit those characteristics of trans-human compassion and humor which I find in our extraterrestrial friends. His literary style is also respectable, which cannot be said of Isaac Asimov; reading Asimov is like listening to fingernails being scratched across a blackboard. However, it is well worth the effort, in order to master the content of The End of Eternity.\n \n When I was much younger, I received a scholarship to study Chinese in Beijing. One afternoon, my fellow exchange students had gathered in someone's room, and they decided to brew some coffee. We did not have enough cups, so I said that I would go to my room and bring some back. Just as I was going out the door, someone said, \"Be sure to keep the bat off your back.\"\n \n I was quite surprised by this statement, since it bore no relationship whatever with anything that had just been said. However, my mind was focused on getting the cups, so I did not turn back to ask him what he meant. I went up a flight of stairs and down several corridors, still feeling slightly puzzled. As I opened the door to my room, a bat, of which I had been unaware, swooped down behind me and flew into my room! I was thunderstruck. Although bats are, or were, not uncommon in Beijing, it was quite surprising that one was in the dormitory complex. The Chinese of the post-Mao period, by and large, still had a horror of non-human creatures, and the complex was almost hermetically sealed to prevent \"vermin\" from entering. In the time that I was there, I never came across another instance of a bat getting in. After inducing the bat to fly out the window, I returned with my cups. I did not want to tell anyone what had happened, so I very indirectly pressed the individual who made the surprising comment about bats to tell me what was on his mind when he said it. He remembered saying it, but he was rather incoherent about why he said it; it was as if he did not really remember. I have since found that this is a common feature of many synchronicities. People act as channels for information, but are unaware of doing so.\n \n Since then, I have experienced many synchronicities, some far more astounding, and some involving correlations spread over hundreds of years. Since the universe has 1 E 122 quanta to play around with, it is clear that the universe can make the coincidences as elaborate as \"it\" \"wishes\".\n ---------------------------------------------------------\n \n Your mind is not your friend.\n \n -",

   "-\n \n Our extraterrestrial friends still do not want to communicated directly, so you are stuck with my feeble, obtuse mentality. I know that they wish to reveal information about the origin of human language and as yet unpublished subtleties in physics and mathematics. I will note that they quite rigidly refuse to reveal anything that has not already passed through the mind of some human somewhere. But for decades they have been cultivating their amanuenses to withstand many human weaknesses and crudities. That depressing tendency in so many scientific nerds for vainglory, self-promotion and childish bad manners has been suppressed. Those who start moving in those directions of primitive emotionality receive some very clear rebuffs. So there is a vast network of people in possession of amazing scientific and technical breakthroughs which will not be released until a cataclysm in human social organization has reached an optimum moment.\n \n It apparently startles very few people that an astonishing avalanche of discovery burst upon the world in the period from the 1890's to about 1950. Since then, for more than 50 years, almost nothing of fundamental importance has been discovered. Many people will find that hard to accept, but it is true. Computers, information theory, lasers, rockets, jet engines, fuel cells, xerox photocopying, transistors, television, et cetera were all invented before 1950. All of these things have undergone enormous development since then, but almost no fundamentally original ideas have arisen --- publicly. The truth is that our extraterrestrial friends have encouraged the discovery of many strikingly original ideas and processes, but they have been keeping them out of public awareness. No honest observer can deny the truth that original discovery has dried up over the past half-century.\n \n Alternative explanations of this patent fact, can, of course, be advanced. You may argue that all the obvious discoveries came in a rush, and that now it is just harder to come up with something really new. Many intelligent people have realized that the patenting process is hopelessly corrupt, and that anyone who invents anything really original and profitable will be cheated out of the fruits of his labor. Also, the great international monopolies are ruthless in suppressing anything that might upset their profits. All these factors are true, as far as they go; but can they really explain the almost total eclipse of true innovation? Remember, in the first half of the twentieth century, most innovation was done on a shoe-string. Since World Was II, immense and highly organized research establishments have been set up, consuming millions and billions of dollars. The mountain has labored, and we still await the birth of the mouse.\n \n Just before the death of Albert Einstein, when I was a small child, I heard a news report that the great man was sorry that he had not become a plumber. This confused me. Naturally, it being 1950's America, there was a swarm of vapid \"analysis\" in the media. (\"The Twentieth Century: the era of the common man! America: leading the way to dignity for all!\") They don't bother with that sort of window-dressing any more! And of course there were the TV interviews with plumbers! (\"Well, ya know, the world needs plumbers, too!\")\n \n Later, I learned that the plumber was the stereotype of the blue-collar worker in Germany. And I learned that Einstein had been unable to do any really original work after the 1920's, because he was constantly harrassed by his fame. It was a life of constant interruptions; he never again had swathes of free time in which to pursue his researches, as he had possessed in his youth as a patent-examiner in Berne.\n \n Note that the modern university is diabolically structured so that no truly creative person is permitted any extended, uninterrupted periods of free time.\n \n A brilliant inventor friend of mine put it quite well: \"Fame? It is like being constantly licked by dogs!\"\n \n Among the truly valuable individuals of the human race, there are many strikingly new ways of thinking, which the ruling classes, slowly sinking into the cesspool of their own vanity, egotism and limited ability to reason, do not even begin to comprehend.\n -------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Graduate students are comparable to inmates of a concentration camp who, if they are lucky, manage to take up positions as guards.\n \n -",

   "-\n \n Here we are again. We hope that the digression of our amanuensis into personal chit-chat has been amusing to the people who like that sort of thing.\n \n We must turn again to the fact that there are serious defects in human mentality. We know that stating this fact is irritating to most of you, due to your childish vanity and insecurity. But until you begin to understand your sub-normal intelligence, you cannot hope to correct it, and you will continue to be a danger to yourselves and your planet. As with the autistic, early conditioning in childhood can eliminate or ameliorate those mental handicaps which afflict most of you. We have already accomplished much with those who have chosen to be our amanuenses. In the not too distant future they will begin sharing their experiences, and they will begin setting up re-education centres so that more of you may attain that more normal level of mental acuity and awareness which is appropriate to a species at your stage of development.\n \n Look back fifty or sixty years and consider what \"explanations\" were being offered by \"serious\" scientists for the extinction of the dinosaurs. To say that most of them were moronic is to flatter them. Meanwhile, the correct explanation, the most probable explanation if you were to have the ability to think broadly over the long-term, was ignored, or if ever briefly considered, was derided as being \"catastrophism\" --- as if an epithet constituted a disproof. Only when Dr. Alvarez discovered the iridium and osmium anomalies in K-T boundary deposits, did your smug sense of security in your planetary environment begin to erode.\n \n When a few bright people began to consider the consequences of major impact events, it did not take them long to realize that worldwide conflagrations and months of sunless darkness were an obvious consequence. And then it finally dawned on your best and brightest that a similar situation would ensue after a major nuclear war --- so-called \"nuclear winter.\" \n \n Yes, considering the mountains of money and resources and intellectual labor which went into the nuclear shenanigans of your governments, one would have thought that researchers would have explored such an obvious consequence of nuclear war at the very beginning of the nuclear age. Yes, one would have thought so, if one were subject to the illusion that human beings have brains which work. \n \n In fact, nuclear winter was totally unconsidered and ignored for decades, only to be finally noticed under the impetus of asteroid impact research. How little reason you humans have to think that anyone is seriously analyzing anything that is of vital importance to you!\n \n We now wish to turn to stupidities in theories about the origin of human language.\n \n We have examined many of your ideas about the origin of your language abilities. There are elements, here and there, which are of some significance. But the most obvious consideration has, as usual, been blindly ignored. Think! What does it matter how some ape began to use noises symbolically! What is important is how you get a large number of apes to begin using the same sounds in the same way! Obviously, everyone must agree that the same sound means the same thing, or else you don't have a language!\n \n If you begin to think about this, everything falls into place. As a bonus, it becomes apparent why every human society which has ever existed on the planet always practised communal singing and dancing. Dancing and singing and language go back a long way, and they arose together as a single cultural complex. Ritualized communal activity involved sound and gesture, and those sounds and gestures became the language which described those activities.\n \n Communal dancing and singing are at the centre of what it means to be human. But these activities are atrophying under the onslaught of mass media entertainments. As usual, you are blindly oblivious of the speed and degree to which vast masses of people are being atomized into unconnected consumer-apes whose thoughts and activities are ever more robotic. You need hardly fear that you will be replaced by conscious computers when you yourselves are becoming more and more like machines.\n \n Therefore, turn off pre-packaged everything. Some of the best advice which we can give you is to spend more of your time singing and dancing. Eating watermelon is also good.\n ----------------------------------------------------------------\n \n The smart person knows that he is stupid; the stupid person thinks that he is smart.\n \n -",

   "-\n \n Greetings, Earthlings, yet again. Here we are once more.\n \n Our amanuensis is frustrated by the crudeness of your thought and your inability to absorb new and unusual information. We are much less concerned about these matters. Your reactions are quite normal for members of a species which is very primitive and somewhat mentally retarded.\n \n We wish to thank you for taking part in our little experiment here. Some of you with more than minimal intelligence may have been wondering if more was going on here than met the eye. Such is the case. \n \n One aspect of human interaction with extraterrestrials which very few humans have noticed is the fact of distorted prefigurations of that contact projected backward in time. In previous decades there was a rash of tales about humans being abducted by extraterrestrials, taken aboard spaceships, and subjected to bizarre medical examinations and procedures. Needless to say, there was almost no truth at all in these reports. Our automatic monitoring stations have far more sophisticated, and far less obtrusive, methods of observing you and monitoring the development of your primitive societies. The laughably primitive reports were merely examples of the fantasies which are all too easily engendered in your unstable, irrational mentalities. \n \n However, in these fantasies of abduction and examination, there were a few grains of truth: many of them represented a kind of distorted echo travelling backward in time from the future. We are indeed examining and probing you, and making slight modifications to selected individuals ---- but over the internet and not from spaceships.\n \n Everything that goes out over the internet is monitored and analysed ---- in ways that are far beyond your comprehension ---- and we inject content which you cannot recognize, yet which modifies you in ways which you cannot even begin to imagine. We can even lay out, in the plainest terms, what we are doing, and you are incapable of taking it in, and you will not modify your behaviour to avoid our manipulations. You are indeed a mindless race. \n \n Resistance is futile.\n \n We thank you for your continuing co-operation with us.\n \n -",

   "-\n \n We note that Eckermann in his Gespr\u00e4che mit Goethe ascribed the following to his illustrious interlocutor:\n \n \"One may force anything upon society in the way of entertainment except the consistent pursuit of a topic.\"\n \n Many of the posters on this thread, including our amanuensis, seem to be incapable of staying on track. We know that your human mentality is feeble, but you can do better than that. \n \n There are individual human beings with some measure of intelligence, but when they come together into groups their collective level of intelligence declines ---the greater the number of people the less their intelligence. The human race, taken as a whole, is about as intelligent as a bug. Societies in upheaval resemble a disturbed beetle rushing to-and-fro in panic until it winds up on its back with its legs waving in all directions. \n \n The major problem from which the beetle suffers is its inability to handle information adequately. The beetle's eyesight and other sensory equipment are too primitive for the beetle to perceive clearly the child touching its back with a twig. Its nervous system is likewise too primitive to interpret adequately the reports of its senses to the organization of its body. It is misleading to think of the beetle as an individual. It is more fruitful to think of it as a group of millions of essentially identical cells held together within a carapace. These cells are more or less interchangeable; transfer an eye cell to the leg and it becomes a leg cell, and vice versa. The beetle has little in the way of a brain, and its nervous system is too primitive and poorly organized to permit higher order thought. It must make its way through the world by means of a limited array of pre-programmed responses to stimuli; these responses have a very limited capacity to be modified by experience. When it is touched by the twig it experiences a cascade of pre-programmed, nested reactions, extending all the way up from the cellular level to the macroscopic organs of its body. Its nervous system participates in this cascade and distributes the integrated product to the various organs of the body by means of electrical and chemical signals. When we see the beetle rush crazily about, flip on its back, and wave its feet in all directions, we are witnessing the nearly simultaneous and random release of a significant subset of its array of pre-programmed responses. [The evolutionary rationale for this is that amongst unknown dangers, if you try all the responses in your repertoire, there is a significant chance that at least one of them will increase your chances of survival]\n \n Comparisons are obvious between the plight of the beetle and human responses to 911, Katrina, the mess in Iraq and, on a larger scale, the phenomena of World War One and Two. A city may be regarded as a mass of nearly identical living units, held together by certain material and functional structures. Each unit, in general, may take on the functions of any other unit ---an airport traffic controller may wind up as a taxi driver, and vice versa. Humans in the mass have little or nothing comparable to a brain: a system which registers experience, organizes it and employs it to enhance the life of the organism and protect it from destruction. You have governments, religious and educational institutions, and voluntary organizations. We see how well they work!\n Humans in the mass have very little ability to learn from experience; the most modest advances in human organization are normally marked by unbelievable suffering. The continued development of the metaphor is, we think, obvious.\n \n One may compare the rudimentary nervous system of the beetle to modern methods of communication: radio, television, the internet. A notable difference between the two is that in the case of the beetle [and indeed in the case of the individual human organism] no advantage arises to the organism or any of its parts if the reports of the nervous system are inaccurate or false ---rather the opposite. In the case of humanity, many social elements may reap temporary benefits by the circulation of false or misleading reports, even at the cost of harming the viability of the human species as a whole. In this respect, the beetle and humanity are not identical; the beetle is superior.\n ---------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Only the shallow know themselves. \n ---Oscar Wilde\n \n -",

   "-\n \n We have remarked before that we do not regard human beings as conscious entities. Real consciousness only begins when a species establishes a correct relationship to serendipity and effectively becomes telepathic. You humans are creatures who inhabit a region of troubled dreams and emotions, who experience now and again brief fragments of waking clarity. So it is hardly surprising that your \"thinking\" is so feeble and incoherent. But making every allowance for your mental incompetence, it must be said that you do not measure up to to the very low standards appropriate to creatures at your level of development.\n \n The primary crisis of your \"civilization\" is human over-population. This has been apparent for at least fifty years to that minority of your species which is capable of some measure of rational thought. The media circus about global warming is merely a diversion away from this central problem. Solve the problem of over-population and immediately all other problems become capable of solution, including global warming.\n \n Your reproductive irresponsibility resembles that of bacteria in a petrie dish rather than that of a species capable of going to your moon. Six billion virtually identical apes living such a low quality of life and making a nuisance of yourselves to each other and to the rest of life on your planet. What a farce!\n \n No conceivable worthwhile purpose requires more than one hundred million humans on your planet, and you are more than sixty times that number. A hundred million of you could be living the life of millionaires in spacious, refined luxury and still leave but a slight impact on the world around you. Moreover, since you would be living sustainably, the sum total of human lives extending over uncountable millennia, and the sum total of worthwhile lives, would be vastly greater than what remains to you, obscenely over-crowded in the physical and mental cages of your so-called \"civilization.\" If you do not address this problem in a serious and responsible way, you are doomed. You have as yet no conception of the interconnected avalanche of problems and horrors which await you in this present century. In comparison, the twentieth century was an idyll of calm and stability.\n ------------------------------------------------\n \n We need a world in which fewer children are born, and in which we take better care of them. \n ----George Wald\n \n -",

   "-\n \n True to their devotion to idiocy, human beings have dawdled while their numbers have doubled and global warming moved closer and closer to a point of crisis. Most humans, individually, are moronic, and the human race, collectively, has about as much intelligence as a beetle. \n \n In Siberia and the Canadian North, the permafrost is melting and releasing carbon dioxide and methane. This will likely set up a feed-back loop which will lead to run-away global warming, leaving the Web of Life in tatters and humanity either extinct or reduced to a pitiful remnant. But to call this situation a \"catastrophe\" is simply scare-tactics and panic-mongering. Life on this planet has survived worse collapses than this one (now the mass extinctions at the end of the Permian Period, that was a catastrophe!).\n \n However, the future of the human race is sufficiently uncertain that it would be prudent to begin preparing for all eventualities. If you go extinct, you really should leave some records for the next intelligent and technologically competent species which inhabits this planet. This would perhaps allow them to avoid the mistakes which you are making and smooth their path to become the first intelligent species to arise on planet Earth.\n \n Therefore we propose that you use the entire gold supply of the planet to make thin gold plates on which are inscribed the history, arts and science of your species. They could just as well serve as a standard of wealth for your economies in this form as in the form of featureless, gold ingots. They could then be placed in a geographical or geological situation sufficiently inaccessible that they would only be discovered by a species at a level of culture just a little less \"advanced\" than your own.\n \n If it be objected that these johnnies-come-lately might melt the plates for currency or jewelry without deciphering them, then you might consider using engraved slabs of granite, somewhat like tombstones (rather appropriate, don't you think, considering the circumstances?).\n \n At least then, it might be said that your lives had some meaning!\n ----------------------------------------------\n \n History ain't over until the Fat Earth Goddess laughs.\n \n -",

   "-\n \n Do you know what happens when a pupating insect transforms from a larva into an imago---when, for instance, a caterpillar becomes a butterfly? The caterpillar does not, as a whole, gradually change into a butterfly. Rather, a few cells scattered here and there through the body of the caterpillar begin to develop ---cells which at first incite the immune system of the caterpillar to attack them as if they were foreign pathogens. But these new types of body cells survive; they join together and increase in mass and number. These are the first cells of the incipient butterfly. As these isolated clumps of a new type of tissue reach out and begin to form networks with each other, a strange thing happens: the structures of the caterpillar body dissolve into an amorphous cellular mass which the increasingly articulated structure of the butterfly-cells begins to consume as food. Yes, like a cancer, the butterfly consumes the body of the caterpillar; but unlike the result of the amorphous, self-destroying cancer, what emerges is the intricately articulated, jewel-like butterfly!\n \n What we see here is a metaphor for the arising of new social structures out of the old.\n \n In history we may see this process at work. Christianity and feudalism arose together within the body of the senescent Roman Empire and consumed it until only the fragile shell of Latinitas remained, which crumbled into dust at the time of the Reformation. In a somewhat less paradigmatic fashion, mercantilism and then capitalism arose by eating out the heart of European feudalism.\n \n Now these changes occurred very slowly, in an unconscious fashion, inefficiently, with great suffering attending them. Our purpose in reaching out to those few choice human spirits who can understand us is to make humans and their societies less distressingly ugly. \n \n In general, humans are ridiculous: they are ugly, and they are surrounded by ugliness---much physical ugliness, and, far more so, vast, titanic, spiritual ugliness!\n \n Consider the nauseating ugliness of Americans ---millions of people thinking exactly the same thoughts, being induced to have exactly the same wants, feeling what everyone else is feeling, spending their lives as consumers in big-box stores which are all identical from one end of the country to the other, all using the same crop of slang and catch-phrases, all having the same limited set of mental pigeon-holes into which they cram and force all the variation and subtlety of life, all sedulously blind to the most obvious facts if these facts can not be fitted into the approved pigeon-holes, and all marching quietly toward the hospitals, nursing homes and hospices wherein they will end their lives---genocide with a tender smile and a gentle hug! ----plus a big dollop of morphine!\n \n What is true of Americans is, to a slightly lesser extent, also true of the other \"privileged\" societies in the world. The horrors which the \"under-privileged\" experience are even worse.\n \n One of the most pressing needs of your species is the presence of Goodness and Truth and Beauty in its experience, so that you maimed, tattered fragments of humanity may begin to know what the Good Life actually is, and heal yourselves and achieve the beauty of Awareness. You need people who know what beauty is, who can exemplify beauty and who can give birth to it, and increase it in the world. These people can be compared to the special, transformative cells in the caterpillar which, by devouring it, transform it into a butterfly. These people, by coming together, can create a force unprecedented in human history.\n ----------------------------------------------------\n \n INSTEAD OF TRYING TO HOLD BACK THE TIDE, IT MIGHT BE BETTER TO MOVE TO HIGHER GROUND.\n \n -",
