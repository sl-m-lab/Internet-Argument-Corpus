Who are we to believe?\n\n It is not who you should believe, it is what you should believe. And this can only come from within you. I think that any religious or pseudo-religious views are by far one of the most personal things in a persons life. Every person must accept or reject each shred of information and knowledge to come up with an internal system of beliefs. As such, I do not believe that there are 2 people in the world who believe exactly the same thing...everyone has some sort of variable within them that makes them unique in their beliefs. Sure, the core principles may be the same, but it is the fine details that make us different. \n \n I guess my short answer is don't worry about what other people think or say about your religion or lack there of, only worry about being true to your own beliefs.\n \n This above all: to thine own self be true,\n And it must follow, as the night the day,\n Thou canst not then be false to any man.\n Farewell; my blessing season this in thee!\n \n -- William Shakespeare",
