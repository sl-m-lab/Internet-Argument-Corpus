   "Think for a moment; who has more control over your daily life- the federal government or Walmart?\n \n Ecology is the branch of biology that studies the interrelationship between living things and their environment from the individual to the ecosystem to the entire biosphere of planet earth.\n \n I think we should borrow the ecological concept of buffering and apply it to politics when it comes to economic matters.\n \n A large ecosystem that has many individual organisms and many different species of organisms is buffered. This means that a single disruption in any part of the ecosystem will not have a major effect on the rest of the ecosystem. If species A can only eat species B, anything that disrupts species B could have catastrophic effects on species A. At the same time if an ecosystem has only 1 population of species A, then the least little thing that affects that population could devastate the entire species. But if species A can eat species B, C and D, species A will have a better chance of survival should anything happen to either one of species B, C or D. And having several different populations of species A will make that species' long-term survival in the ecosystem more likely.\n \n If we replace species with business, then we can apply the concept of buffering to the economy. For example, the U.S. has only 3 U.S. owned (or is it 2- I don't know about Chrysler at the moment) auto manufacturers. This means that if any one of these manufacturers has a problem the entire U.S. auto industry is threatened. The more manufacturers we have the less likely a disruption with any one of them will be catastrophic to the economy. In the same vein the more auto manufacturers we have the more consumer choice there is (we wouldn't all have to ride around in trucks and SUVs because that is what the big 3 tell us we can buy) and the more chance auto workers displaced from one company will have to find work in the same industry.\n \n Personally I don't think the loss of the big 3 in Detroit would be all that great a loss. The woes of the auto industry are not kitchen table issues for most Americans. But Wal-Mart is another example that is very much a kitchen table issue.\n \n The history of retail trade where I have live aptly reflects the results of letting a single economic species come to dominate an ecosystem.\n \n 5 Stores: Here when I was born in 1968, but out of business before Wal-Mart first opened here in 1987 (stores that I am aware of; there may be others that I am too young to remember):\n Grants\n J M Fields\n Woolco\n Sun Discount\n Atlantic Mills\n \n 9 Stores: Not here when Wal-Mart opened, entered market after Wal-Mart opened but now out of business:\n Phar-mor\n Drug Emporium\n Luria's\n Everything's $1\n Circuit City\n Hollywood Video\n Uptons\n Mervyns\n Blockbuser\n \n 12 Stores: Here before Wal-Mart opened but now out of business (*shared a parent company):\n Montgomery Ward's (a Sears-type store)/Jefferson Ward's (a Kmart-type store)\n Pic-n-Save\n Zayer's/Ames\n Standard Sales/Leeds/Service Merchandise\n Diana Shop*\n Strawberry Fields*\n Jean Nicole*\n Western Auto\n TG&Y, McCrory, Murphy's/Murphy's Mart (same parent company)\n Revco\n Coconuts Tapes and Records/Coconuts\n Standard Brands (appliance store)\n Count Sears/Kmart count as loss of 1 store due to merger\n \n 2 stores: Here before Wal-Mart opened, closed then reopened and closed again:\n Jefferson Ward's/Montgomery Ward's\n Linens n Things\n \n 16 Stores: Entered the market after Wal-Mart opened and still open:\n Big Lots/Odd Lots/McFrugal (has fewer stores now than it had at its height)\n Dollar Tree\n Target\n Best Buy\n H H Gregg\n Kohl's\n Bell's/Bell's outlet\n Auto Zone~\n Pep Boys~\n Advanced Auto Parts~\n Sports Authority# (has only 2 stores)\n Gander Mountain# (has only 1 store)\n Dick's Sporting# Goods (has only 2 stores)\n Pet Supermarket (1 store)\n Petsmart\n Petco (2 stores)\n \n 4 Stores: Here when Wal-Mart opened and still here:\n Sears/Kmart\n Wallgreens\n Eckerd's Drugs/CVS\n JC Penney's\n \n 3 Stores: Specialty stores (compete with Wal-Mart in a limited number of product categories) that have opened since the 1st Wal-Mart and still open:\n Michael's Craft and Decorating\n A.C. More (only 1 store for a metropolitan area of 1,000,000+ people)\n Garden Ridge (only 1 local location, but next to a locally owned craft supply store that has recently closed after being in business for 30+ years)\n Bed Bath and Beyond\n \n 4 Stores: Specialty stores open before Wal-Mart but now closed:\n Old America Store (general arts and craft and home d\u00e9cor)\n Wacamaw (arts and craft, home d\u00e9cor, kitchenware).\n Let's Cook\n Rolling Pin\n \n 2 Stores: Upscale stores, not direct competitors with Wal-Mart still present:\n Ivey's/Dillards\n May Cohens/Maison Blanche/Gayfers/Belk\n \n 2 Stores: Upscale stores, not direct competitors with Wal-Mart out of business:\n Furchgott's\n Jacobsen's\n \n # Stores like Zayer's, Pic-n-Save and Western Auto sold guns and ammo. Both Gander Mountain and Sports Authority sell guns and ammo. But since Walmart no longer sells guns or ammo and Kmart stoped selling guns and ammo once it merged with Sears (I don't know if Sears still sells guns or ammo), there has been a net loss of stores that sell guns and ammo in my local market since Walmart first opened.\n \n ~These stores have partially replaced Western Auto but because of their small size you would need one of each to match the size of a single Western Auto store. Because of that product and brand selection have diminished since Walmart came to town. Furthermore, Kmart has mostly done away with auto parts and has closed its auto service garage since the merger with Sears. Also, JC Penney's has closed its only auto center in town.",
