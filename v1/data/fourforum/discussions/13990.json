   "Oklahoma\n   Senate Approves Oklahoma Firearms Freedom Act \n The Senate approved Senate Bill 1685 on Wednesday on a vote of 39 to 3.\n \n X\"As a private citizen and as a state senator, I believe it is important that we guard against the continued erosion of the Bill of Rights, including the right to protect ourselves and our families,\" said Brogdon, R-Owasso.X \"This legislation reaffirms our Second Amendment rights.\"\n \n XUnder the provisions of Senate Bill 1685, no firearms or ammunition manufactured in Oklahoma and remaining in the state could be subject to any federal regulations, including federal registration requirements. \n \n \"The benefits of this measure are actually two-fold.X The first goal is protection of our Constitutional rights, but the second is to give further incentive to firearm manufacturers to consider Oklahoma for their operations,\" Brogdon said.\n",

No doubt some nefarious excuse to farther control the people and attempt to charge user fees to discourage a right. No doubt sinjin will approve so \"they\" can match fingerprints and type of ammo to the DROS registration file?\n \n \nI think this could be a great economic opportunity.

Seems he is more pro rights and 2A than 'da terminator'.",
