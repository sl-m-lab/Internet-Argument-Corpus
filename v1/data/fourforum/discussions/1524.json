Such a great saint as Augustine swears that he saw: a blind child restored to sight by the relics of Saint Gervaise and Saint Protasius at Milan; a woman in Carthage cured of a cancer by the sign of the cross made by a woman who had just been baptised; his close friend Hesperius driving off devils (who were infesting his house) by using a little soil taken from the sepulchre of our Lord, and that same soil, borne into the Church, suddenly curing a paralytic; a woman who, having touched the reliquary of Saint Stephen with a posy of flowers during a procession, rubbed her eyes with them afterwards and recovered her sight which she had recently lost...

   "Derinda,\n I would suggest that you begin with 3 books if you are interested in a Christian perspective on God's existence: Mere Christianity  by C.S. Lewis (shortest and easiest to read of the three), The Case for Christ  by Lee Strobel (a bit longer but also not a difficult read), The Everlasting Man by G.K. Chesterton (longer and a bit more difficult).\n \n Here are some quotes from the Everlasting Man that I post whenever I have the chance. Just some simple truths for you to ponder in your questioning:\n \n \"In the land lit by that neighboring star, whose blaze is the broad daylight, there are many and very various things, motionless and moving. There moves among them a race that is in its relation to others a race of gods. The fact is not lessened but emphasised because it can behave like a race of demons...It is customary to insist that man resembles the other creatures. Yes; and that very resemblance he alone can see. The fish does not trace the fish-bone pattern in the fowls of the air; or the elephant and the emu compare skeletons. Even in the sense in which man is at one with the universe it is an utterly lonely universality. The very sense that he is united with all things is enough to sunder him from all.\"\n \n \"The more we really look at man as an animal, the less he will look like one.\n \n The simplest truth about man is that he is a very strange being; almost in the sense of being a stranger here on the earth...He has much more of the external appearance of one bringing alien habits from another land than of a mere growth of this one. He has an unfair advantage and an unfair disadvantage. He cannot sleep in his own skin; he cannot trust his own instincts. He is at once a creator moving miraculous hands and fingers and a kind of cripple. He is wrapped in artificial bandages called clothes; he is propped on artificial crutches called furniture. His mind has the same doubtful liberties and the same wild limitations. Alone among the animals, he is shaken with the beautiful madness called laughter...Alone among the animals he feels...the mystery of shame. Whether we praise these things as natural to man or abuse them as artificial in nature, they remain in the same sense unique. This is realised by the whole popular instinct called religion.\"\n \n \"Suppose that one bird out of a thousand birds began to do one of the thousand things that man had already done even in the morning of the world; and we can be quite certain that the onlooker would not regard such a bird as a mere evolutionary variety of the other birds; he would regard it as a fearful wild-fowl indeed...That bird would tell the augurs, not of something that would happen, but of something that had happened. That something would be the appearance of a mind with a new dimension of depth; a mind like that of man. If there be no God, no other mind  could conceivable have foreseen it...There may be a broken trail of stones and bones faintly suggesting the development of the human body. There is nothing even faintly suggesting such a development of the human mind. It was not and it was; we know not in what instant or infinity of years. Something happened; and it has all the appearance of a transaction outside time.\"",

I also agree with poet. I could not \"prove\" to you (or anyone else who doesn't already believe He exists) that he exists. I don't think that is my place. It is enough for me that I know He does.
