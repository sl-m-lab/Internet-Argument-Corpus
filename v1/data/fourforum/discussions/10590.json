   "The problem with your argument is that you fail to see the fact that I don't necessarily want anyone of the sort of Britney Spears marrying, so I'm not making laws about just her, but all like her.\n\n \n I had to laugh there. How many people are like Britney Spears? Seriously, how many shoves do you go through per argument digging your own grave? \n \n \nYou have to set certain legal standards such as \"No two persons can enter into marriage who are not one male and one female. No one can enter into this contract who has entered into it with someone other than the current person more than twice.\n\n \n None of which prevent mischief.\n \n \nA person who is held to make a mockery of this institution by a jury of their peers must be granted the right to enter into it again by an act of this legislature or upon appeal to a higher court.\"\n\n \n And that differs materially how from simply writing a law stating that Person X cannot be married? \n \n \nThe issue of marriage in the early history of our country was linked to citizenship, but it is a very complicated issue and too lengthy to get into in this post.\n\n \n No it wasn't. The issue of marriage in the early history of our country was linked to property and inheritance as well as legitimate lines of inheritance. Citizenship was irrelevant. Can you feel China yet in your grave? \n \n \nThe issue isn't who runs an institution, it is who is the protected party.\n\n \n There are no 'protected' parties in marriage, aside from the children, but that's a entirely different issue. It seems like you really have no idea what you talking about and just spewing out things you think are relevant. \n \n \nIn the case of marriage the two people are considered to be one.\n\n \n No they aren't. If one person in the marriage commits a crime, the other is not automatically guilty. The illegal income from one person does not make the income from the other illegal. Furthermore the government recognizes that two people are in the marriage, not one. What are you talking about and you ever heard of a thing called google?\n \n Research before posting. This is getting ridiculous. \n \n \nand share each other's things unless if specified in a prenuptial agreement.\n\n \n Try again wrong-o. Illegal acts prevent one from claiming the assets of another. Furthermore if the deed only has one name then the other is screwed. Also in divorce court a number of situations can result in one party not receiving half of the assets even without a prenup. And a prenuptial does nothing to ensure that assets during the marriage are equally shared.\n \n Seriously! How many shoves do you go through? Are on the the first name basis with the shovel guy at your local home improvement store? \n \n \nIn the case of a corporation, the property of it is protected, and the corporation is established via the owner through the state.\n\n \n What property? The property of the corporation is owned first to debtors, then preferred stock and then common stock. The employees get nothing in the case of a liquidation. A marriage has nothing similar to a preferred or common stock. \n \n Whether or not marriage is not the primary issues is irrelevant to me. You made a crazy argument.

And the marriage contract often exposes people to liabilities. They are less protected from law suits and other aspects after entering the contract.

No. Spouse A inherits a piece of property that is solely given to spouse A on the deed and will. Does Spouse B legally own it? No. Who does the state levy property tax on?

   "Care to document this claim?\n \n If the government established by the Constitution was meant to be only a federal government, meaning that is applied only to the states and not individuals, explain how and why laws regulating commerce apply to individuals; laws pertaining to piracy and bankruptcy apply to individuals; laws pertaining to currency apply to individuals and taxes and tariffs apply to individuals.\n\n \n Nate and those of his ilk fail to see that there is a Supremacy Clause in the Constitution.\n \n I think the Framers blew it when they rejected Hamilton's idea of a unitary state, with the various \"states\" serving as mere administrative districts of the national government.",

   "Yes, because Republicans are the only hypocrites in the government, right? emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n The Republicans are hypocrites in a lot of ways, but Democrats are even more hypocritical in some respects. \n \n Just note, for example, Chester's relentless use of class suprematist terminology. \n \n I guess, as a liberal, he doesn't respect janitors.",

   "If we stuck true to what we are defined as we would have a similar but slightly different system of government than our present system.\n \n Power would be stronger in the states, and act more like a union of nations as we are actually described as that even by the name \"United States of America\" can be loosely translated to \"Union of Countries in the Continent of America\".\n \n We have states because people with differing values understood that they needed a place for themselves to practice what they believe apart from others rather than impose beliefs as a centralized country which is exactly what they ran away from and formed a country to combat in the first place. We are a country because we are a formidable force as such.\n \n Originally we were an political alloy of beliefs combining to become one of the strongest and most diverse systems of government that had ever been devised. Now we are seeing the advent of centralization and our federation of states is becoming a singular entity.\n \n The democratic and republican forms of government are flawed in that they give favor to what is popular and not what is right. It takes several men to do good and only a few to destroy what good has been done. When you only have a few that want to do good and several that want to destroy that good then you have disaster. It's our achilles' heel, if you will.\n \n If one country in a federation fails, the federation will continue. If we are truly just a singular country and we fail, then the whole thing is gone. As power is concentrated, decisions are made faster and more efficiently, thus the pursuit of a more centralized government for the United States is born. The only issue is that few are in charge of the well-being of many and small mistakes are turned into massive ones.\n \n The sum of the parts is not as great as the whole, but there is a very striking difference between a Union or Federation and a Country. A balance must be maintained, and if it fails then we have nothing to fear from other countries that wish ill will upon the United States for we have destroyed ourselves from within.",
