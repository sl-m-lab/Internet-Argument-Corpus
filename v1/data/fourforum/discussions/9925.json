   "\n That's only because you have no clue what 'natural selection' means. \"Environmental triggers\" or stimulants, are 100% lamarckian, and have nothing whatsoever in common with darwinian, 'selection'.\n\n \n Obviously our loquacious lagomorph, a devout Darwin-denier, is terminally confused about two distinct forms of adaptation in biology. The first is organismal adaptation in response to environmental cues. Examples include, as I have mentioned before, changes in fur colour or density with the season, or behavioural changes in response to seasonal food availability. Not all species have equal abilities to adapt to environmental changes, and many have adapted to a single environment and fare poorly if it changes beyond fairly narrow parameters. A single genome (and epigenome) can encode all the necessary information for adaptive responses to an environment.\n \n The other important form of adaptation is species adaptation, where owing to genetic evolution, new traits are adapted from old ones, for example, wings from limbs. This is no mere epigenetic change like fur colour, but a profound change in how genes are expressed. It can't easily be switched on and off by altering the epigenetic environment, except in unusual cases. Chicken embryos, for example, can be induced to grow teeth-like structures... the genes to do this are still there, though they evidently have other functions as well, but it takes considerable artificial tissue manipulation to switch them on.\n \n What really baffles me is why anyone should think this is somehow inconsistent with Darwinian theory. I realise our loquacious lagomorph doesn't read anything he thinks will be disagreeable, so he never learns anything new, but Darwinian theory isn't irrevocably tied to any particular model of how genes control development. Indeed, Darwin thought of it before anyone had heard of genes.\n \n Our ideas of how genes control development have evolved considerably over the last few years -- not that lagomorph has a clue about them -- but there is nothing about them that disproves Darwinian theory, or, come to that, supports Lamarck. Maybe there is a back door somewhere in epigenetics for Lamarckian mechanisms of inheriting acquired characteristics, but I haven't seen a case for it yet. The only way one can claim, as our lagomorph does, that epigenetics disproves \"Darwinism\" is to have a totally clueless idea of what \"Darwinism\" is.",

I guess biology comes in for its share of cranks who think that the latest discovery in developmental biology \"disproves\" Darwin.\n \n After all, unless you tilt at the giants, who's going to care what you have to say? So cranks confuse windmills with giants... it's not going to stop them from tilting.\n \n Someone like lagomorph isn't going to know that biologists haven't thought for decades, if they ever did, that an organism's phenotype is rigidly determined by its genotype with no input from the environment. Biologists have long been aware that within limits, there is no such thing as genetic predestination for any organism. Many species have genotypes that allow some flexibility in rapid adaptation to their local environment.

TOE pretty much considers most genes to have mutated along the way after all!\n\n \n **\n There is a huge difference between the darwinian principle that for an expressed phenotypic trait to alter, both in form and function, there must first be a molecular change in a 'gene', (lately revised to 'genes'), that molecular change being called a 'mutation', with that physico-chemical mechanical change being the start a linear chain of causation that ends with a 'mutated' organismic bioform, or pattern of behaviour. Again, recently, the mechanical linearity of Fisherian 1 to 1 gene/trait expression has been shown to be false, as developmental biology regains its rightful place over materialist geneticism. But still darwinist reserve the right to insist that organismic change, evolution, originates in in inert DNA molecules, and only afterwards is expressed as organismic change. The op shows that organismic change can and does happen as an organismic [intelligent, volitional] non-linear response to environmental change, and NOT, as darwinists insist, as a a linear, mechanical reaction to some spontaneously generated chemical alteration at the the molecular , 'genetic', level. Simply because the traits changed, both in form and function, while the gene/s changed not at all.\n \n \n\n \"One that already served a purpose.

The paper says emphatically that it DID NOT mutate. That's the whole point of this thread. And yes, thanks to developmental biology, various 'genome projects', and so forth, we now know that darwinian genetic linearity is and always has been wrong, wrong, wrong, and that \"1 gene=1 trait\" is exceptional, and limited to extremely simple organisms. As for your attempt at partial regression of causation, by attempting to put forward that even though the 'gene' did not itself change, its 'expression' was modified by HOX or controller genes that had themselves been spontaneously 'mutated', instead, that doesn't hold up under scrutiny, either. If, and it's a big 'if', the 'control genes' were somehow 'mutated' in order to re-direct the development of the unchanged genes, you're going to have to show some mechanical cause for their alteration, without an appeal to 'magick'.\n \n [quote]\n \"And whether or not it got \"selected for\", the gene's change in function was purely an organismic response to a change in the organism's environment.\" \n \n Nope the authors are postulating that the new pattern of expression was selective with regard to reproductive fittness in a new enviornment.

DNA is simply an acid, i.e., an inert molecule. It is totally passive unless and until something external to its own being causes it to change.\n The genome is a system, but its entire 'raison d'etre' is stability and stasis, not change. Like any system, including a coded 'information system', which is what it is, it is subject to entropy, [degradation of signification], but the organism has several self-correcting mechanisms in order to deal with this. Otherwise, the genome/code cannot change-- NOT UNLESS the organism causes it to change, deliberately, non-entropically, teleologically, in accord with systemic needs. And that is when DNA is reconfigured, 're-coded', adaptively.

Organismic change covers any change in an organism. That covers genetic changes as well as every other change, even getting a suntan, for example. But speaking of organismic change that that persists over one or more generations, [i.e., evolutionary organismic change], such organismic changes can be inherited epigenetically, which by definition means without any genetic change, aka 'mutation'. Epigenetic inheritance and developmental evolution go hand in hand, as per the OP. Any change in the genome, instead of happening first, as per geneticist, darwinist evolution, actually happens last, if it happens at all-- as per organismic, lamarckian evolution.

The pattern of inheritance during breeding nicely establishes this in many cases. Many traits are well known as being polygenic.\n\n \n You're right that biologists were surprised that only 20-25,000 ORFs were responsible for an estimated 100,000 transcribed proteins in humans (I am really not sure where that estimate comes from, and it may even be an underestimate), but not by the fact that the functional human genome wasn't vastly different from other animal species. Biologists have long known that the basic structure of the building blocks of life, the structural and catalytic proteins, carbohydrates and lipids, aren't so much different from flatworms to people. Indeed, not much different from bacteria to people.\n \n The real key lies, as biologists have suspected for many decades and known for some 20 years or so, in how and when they are expressed, which is controlled by other associated DNA sequences, and those vary in number and arrangement from species to species. For example, it's pretty much the same genes that build a penguin's flipper as a bat's wing, or a human arm or leg. The difference lies in their pattern of expression, which depends not merely on the species, but their position in the embryo as defined by gradients of gene products first laid down maternally in the original egg.\n \n I don't know why WW is hell-bent on reading some sort of mystical vitalism into this, or why he thinks it's intelligent or intelligently designed, but i think he's basically a fundamentalist Darwin-denier, because that's what gets him attention.

DNA methylation affects the binding of both chromatin and various transcription factors (especially in promoter regions of DNA), and so acts by switching genes off, sometimes whole chromosomes, for example the X-chromosome. Still, I think this is just one example of epigenetic control. I recall that modification of histones (by acetylation?) would affect local chromatin structure and switch off whole regions of genes. There are numerous small RNAs that affect gene expression by binding to DNA as well. As far as I'm concerned, all the various transcription factors that bind to promoter and inhibitor sequences are all examples of epigenetic factors.

Remember, what we are talking about here is basins of stability. There is no reason to think that epigenetic changes can't lead from one basin of stable modifications to the genetic environment to another, while keeping the same genome. It just depends on how many different steady state configurations of epigenetic environments one genome can support.\n \n After all, every genome supports up to hundreds of different cell types, depending on the organism, each with its own epigenetic environment.

   "And since you still do not 'get it', epigenetics does not challenge genetics. It does challenge the darwinist/geneticist/fisherian notion of evolution's mechanism. There, I've pointed out your error again, even knowing that you'll just never grasp the point.\n Reply With Quote\n So if YOU are not challenging genetics via epigenetics and since the NDS is very much based on genetics then how do you believe your arguemt (whatever it actually is) chanllenges NDS? Frankly I do not see that you have challenged anything at all. What do you think the core mechanism of NDS is? Hint is VSI repeated over and over. V is taken to be due to genes, I is taken to be genetic in general, and Selection is differential survival and reproduction of variants.\n \n Variation is observable\n Inheritance is observable\n Selection is observable\n \n Which do you think you cn falsify? And how do you propose to pull it off experimentally?",

   "I DID NOT say that methylation did not change \"the structure and sequence of DNA\". In fact, I drew a parallel with the change from flippers to feet. What I DID say, and I'll repeat it so you don't miss it again, was that the point of epigenetics is the 'something' that \"_directs_ 'methylation', and every other chemical process in biology\". Methylation and other biochemical events don't just happen, and they don't happen just because they feel like happening, either. Sooner or later your mechanical regression of causation runs out of any place further to go.\n Well that puts you in an even worse position as there are known processes which methylation does not direct! Quite a number of em in fact. Thousands in fact. Feel free to believe otherwise if you do not mind being wrong.\n\n \n \n **\n And you just keep posting non sequiturs and lobbing red herrings.

   "Garbage. Nope standard mainstream science supported by reams of empirical data and experiments.So wrong that it's just plain stupid.Nope. Without selection all variants will survive and reproduce equally well and gene frequencies will be locked. Of course that seldom if ever is the case and if such a situation is present it seldom lasts for long. Selection is virtually always opertive in the real world.So what? Beside the point.\n No so. You claimed that methylation directed all the processes in a cell. This is demonstrably untrue. The facts run counter to your argument.\"slip by\"? You're the only one 'insinuating slyly' in this thread.\n Yes slip by. Meaning that you convolve epigenetic effects with being directed so as to yield better optimized traits. And then confuse this with non-random mutation by making the hidden assumption that such epigenetic effects necessarily lie within 90 degrees of the optimizing change vector. There are two separate issues. First is simple change which may be non-random with respect to any number of criteria and then there is change which is non-random with respect to movement on the fitness landscape in the direction of the optimum change vector. To achieve the result you postulate any bias in mutation must be non-random with respect to the optimum change vector. You never seem to get round to explicating this particular hidden assumption. Why I do not know. Perhaps you are unaware that you are making such a glaring logicl error.\n You still say \"explanations\" when you ought to be saying, \"descriptions\". Probably because you cannot grasp the distinction, and never ever will.\n \n Elucidation of a detailed mechanism constitutes an explanation in science. Like it or not them is the rules. If you prefer to call it a mechanism thats fine with me. If you expect to answer WHY questions in terms of ultimate causes then you should consult a priest or other theist. Science does not deal with ultimate causes.\n \n I said:Methylation events happen because of the relevant chemistry and physics if you read your own sources you will discover this.\n You replied:Yeah, right, and the \"relevant chemistry and physics \", \"just happen, that's all\". Isn't that your philosophy, in a nut shell?\n \n No they happen with cause. If you wish to go into the dynamics and mechanisms of chemical reactions then feel free to make the attempt. I am after all a chemist and have some schooling and experiience in the area. Reactions proceed according to discernable mechanisms and at reasonably predictable rates. Be fun to see how much of this you understand.",
