   "The list of stupid things this man has said is so long we would need a large space on the web to post all of them.......\n \n It would be best if he just stopped talking.......\n \n here are some samples of the outlandish rubbish that spews from this man's lips....\n \n We have enough votes to run the country. And when the people say, \"We've had enough,\" we are going to take over.\n -- Pat Robertson, speech given to the April, 1980 \"Washington for Jesus\" rally, quoted from Robert Boston, The Most Dangerous Man in America, p. 29\n \n If Christian people work together, they can succeed during this decade in winning back control of the institutions that have been taken from them over the past 70 years. Expect confrontations that will be not only unpleasant but at times physically bloody.... This decade will not be for the faint of heart, but the resolute. Institutions will be plunged into wrenching change. We will be living through one of the most tumultuous periods of human history. When it is over, I am convinced God's people will emerge victorious.\n -- Pat Robertson, Pat Robertson's Perspective Oct-Nov 1992\n \n We at the Christian Coalition are raising an army who cares. We are training people to be effective -- to be elected to school boards, to city councils, to state legislatures, and to key positions in political parties.... By the end of this decade, if we work and give and organize and train, THE CHRISTIAN COALITION WILL BE THE MOST POWERFUL POLITICAL ORGANIZATION IN AMERICA.\n -- Pat Robertson, in a fundraising letter, July 4, 1991\n \n There is no such thing as separation of church and state in the Constitution. It is a lie of the Left and we are not going to take it anymore.\n -- Pat Robertson, address to his American Center for Law and Justice, November, 1993. Let's see, now: \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\" How could the prohibition against Congress making laws respecting an establishment of religion be anything but the separation of church and state?\n \n They scream, \"First Amendment.\" Of course, the First Amendment, as you and I both know, is a restriction on Congress.... So it really doesn't have anything to do with what you say or what I say, one way or the other.\n -- Pat Robertson, The 700 Club television program, December 10, 1990, deliberately misrepresenting what it means by \"Congress shall make no law\" by omitting mention of the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments, and yet sniveling about the Supreme Court's state-church decisions\n \n There is never in the Constitution at any point, anything that applies that to the states, none at all. The Supreme Court has done it over repeated attempts by Congress which have been beaten back to do such a thing.\n -- Pat Robertson, The 700 Club television program, April 11, 1986, deliberately misrepresenting what it means for the states to have the right to decide issues not covered by the Constitution at the Federal level (much which was clarified by the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments)\n \n A Supreme Court ruling is not the Law of the United States. The law of the United Sates is the Constitution, treaties made in accordance with the Constitution, and laws duly enacted by the Congress and signed by the president. And any of those things I would uphold totally with all of my strength, whether I agreed with them or not.... I am bound by the laws of the United States and all 50 states ... [but] I am not bound by any case or any court to which I myself am not a party.... I don't think the Congress of the United States is subservient to the courts.... They can ignore a Supreme Court ruling if they so choose.\n -- Pat Robertson, speaking to a group of Washington Post writers, as reported in the Washington Post, June 27,1986\n \n Supreme Court decisions are binding in the court systems ... but in terms of general law, which binds every citizen, why should you and I be bound because of the ineptitude, if you will, or the skill of one or more defense lawyers, or the plaintiffs in any particular lawsuit?\n -- Pat Robertson, The 700 Club television program, October 23, 1987. No wonder he couldn't pass the Bar Exam: any decision by a court at the federal level becomes law, binding upon all citizens.\n \n We have imagined ourselves invulnerable and have been consumed by the pursuit of ... health, wealth, material pleasures and sexuality... It [terrorism] is happening because God Almighty is lifting his protection from us.\n -- Pat Robertson, oblivious to the statistical (and obvious) fact that no nation or group of people has ever enjoyed a higher degree of personal, political, or economic safety than the Americans enjoy today, Robertson engages the fearmongering typical of Christian preachers by blaming the Americans' lifestyles for bringing upon themselves the judgement of the God of Everlasting Mercy; this is Robertson's explanation of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, in a three-page statement released Thursday, September 13, 2001, quoted from AANEWS #958 by American Atheists (September 14, 2001)\n \n [Excerpt]:\n We have a court that has essentially stuck its finger in God's eye. We have insulted God at the highest levels of our government. Then, we say, \"Why does this happen?\" It is happening because God Almighty is lifting His protection from us.\n -- Pat Robertson, blaming American lifestyles for bringing God's judgement upon us in the form of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, in a three-page statement released Thursday, September 13, 2001, quoted from AANEWS #958 by American Atheists (September 14, 2001), and from Dick Meyer, \"Holy Smoke,\" CBS News (September 15, 2001)\n \n [Passage]:\n We have a court that has essentially stuck its finger in God's eye and said we're going to legislate you out of the schools. We're going to take your commandments from off the courthouse steps in various states. We're not going to let little children read the commandments of God. We're not going to let the Bible be read, no prayer in our schools. We have insulted God at the highest levels of our government. And then we say, \"Why does this happen?\"\n Well, why it's happening is that God Almighty is lifting his protection from us.\n -- Pat Robertson, explaining on his 700 Club cable TV program why the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, had occurred two days earlier (but oblivious as to why such nations as Sweden and The Netherlands, both many orders more secular than the U.S. could ever hope to be, are spared such tragedies), quoted from Beth Corbin, ed., Americans United Activist Release: \"Pat Robertson Prays for Supreme Court Changes\" (July 15, 2003)\n \n But I want to say as surely as I am sitting here today, this is only a foretaste, a little warning, of what is going to happen..\n -- Pat Robertson, remarking on the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, even after receiving a personal rebuke from the President, quoted from Dick Meyer, \"Holy Smoke,\" CBS News (September 15, 2001)\n \n This is God's power and he sent this thing to warn us ... we needed a shock.\n -- Pat Robertson, remarking on the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, quoted by Robert E. Norlander in a dispatch of September 14, 2001\n \n I think George Bush is going to win in a walk. I really believe that I'm hearing from the Lord it's going to be like a blowout election of 2004. It's shaping up that way. The Lord has just blessed him.... I mean, he could make terrible mistakes and comes out of it. It doesn't make any difference what he does, good or bad. God picks him up because he's a man of prayer and God's blessing him.\n -- Pat Robertson, The 700 Club television program, , January 2, 2004 \u0086\u0086\n \n \n U.S. Constitution: For Christians Only\n \n The Constitution of the United States, for instance, is a marvelous document for self-government by the Christian people. But the minute you turn the document into the hands of non-Christian people and atheistic people they can use it to destroy the very foundation of our society. And that's what's been happening.\n -- Pat Robertson, The 700 Club television program, December 30, 1981\n \n \n Only Christians and Jews in Government\n \n Individual Christians are the only ones really -- and Jewish people, those who trust God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob -- are the only ones that are qualified to have the reign, because hopefully, they will be governed by God and submit to Him.\n -- Pat Robertson, The 700 Club television program, January 11, 1985, defending his stance that only Christians and Jews are fit to hold public office\n \n I never said that in my life ... I never said only Christians and Jews. I never said that.\n -- Pat Robertson, Time magazine, after having been confronted regarding his statement on The 700 Club of January 11, 1985\n \n When I said during my presidential bid that I would only bring Christians and Jews into the government, I hit a firestorm. \"What do you mean?\" the media challenged me. \"You're not going to bring atheists into the government? How dare you maintain that those who believe in the Judeo-Christian values are better qualified to govern America than Hindus and Muslims?\" My simple answer is, \"Yes, they are.\"\n -- Pat Robertson, The New World Order, p. 218\n \n \n Why Hundus and Muslims Cannot Govern\n \n If anybody understood what Hindus really believe, there would be no doubt that they have no business administering government policies in a country that favors freedom and equality.... Can you imagine having the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini as defense minister, or Mahatma Gandhi as minister of health, education, and welfare? The Hindu and Buddhist idea of karma and the Muslim idea of kismet, or fate condemn the poor and the disabled to their suffering.... It's the will of Allah. These beliefs are nothing but abject fatalism, and they would devastate the social gains this nation has made if they were ever put into practice.\n -- Pat Robertson, The New World Order, p. 219\n \n \n Christians Are Just -- Better People\n \n I think patriotism, love of God, love of country, support of the traditional family. They [Christians] believe it would be good for our country if families were closer together.... I think they feel about them more strongly than others do.\n -- Pat Robertson, speaking at a rally in Lansing, Michigan, in 1986, having been asked if there are some issues Christians feel more strongly about that non-Christians\n \n \n But Only Certain Kinds of Christians\n \n You say you're supposed to be nice to the Episcopalians and the Presbyterians and the Methodists and this, that, and the other thing. Nonsense. I don't have to be nice to the spirit of the Antichrist. I can love the people who hold false opinions but I don't have to be nice to them.\n -- Pat Robertson, The 700 Club television program, January 14, 1991\n \n \n Proposed 'Godly Fumigation' of Non-Christians\n \n It is interesting, that termites don't build things, and the great builders of our nation almost to a man have been Christians, because Christians have the desire to build something. He is motivated by love of man and God, so he builds. The people who have come into [our] institutions [today] are primarily termites. They are into destroying institutions that have been built by Christians, whether it is universities, governments, our own traditions, that we have.... The termites are in charge now, and that is not the way it ought to be, and the time has arrived for a godly fumigation.\n -- Pat Robertson, New York Magazine, August 18, 1986\n \n \n Political Assassinations Recommended\n \n I know it sounds somewhat Machiavellian and evil, to think that you could send a squad in to take out somebody like Osama bin Laden, or to take out the head of North Korea, but isn't it better to do something like that, to take out Milosevic, to take out Saddam Hussein, rather than to spend billions of dollars on a war that harms innocent civilians and destroys the infrastructure of a country?\n -- Pat Robertson, The 700 Club television program, August 9, 1999, quoted in Martin McLaughlin, \"Pat Robertson favors assassinations,\" August 14, 1999, World Socialist Web Site\n \n \n Immunity from Prosecution: 'God Told Me to Do It'\n \n Gerard Thomas Straub\n Writer and TV Executive, former The 700 Club producer\n \n The public education movement has also been an anti-Christian movement... We can change education in America if you put Christian principles in and Christian pedagogy in. In three years, you would totally revolutionize education in America.\n -- Pat Robertson, The 700 Club television program, September 27, 1993\n \n These socialists, and they're in there now, starting with the President and his associates ... they want to squeeze out religion because if people read the Bible, they can't be enslaved. You'll never have a socialist government where everybody's Christian.\n -- Pat Robertson, The 700 Club television program, February 18, 1994 \n \n God and morality, the Clinton administration wants out of the country.\n -- Pat Robertson, The 700 Club television program, December 23, 1993\n \n A cult is any group that has a form of godliness, but does not recognize Jesus Christ as the unique son of God.... One test of a cult is that it often does not strictly teach that Jesus is the only begotten Son of God who Himself is God manifested in the flesh.... Christian-oriented cults include the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or Reorganized Church of Latter Day Saints (Mormons), the Worldwide Church of God, Christian Science, Unity, Unitarianism, The Way International, Rosicrucian Society of America, Bahai, Hare Krishna, Scientology, the Unification Church, and the Jehovah's Witnesses.\n -- Pat Robertson, CBN pamphlet entitled \"Cults,\" dated 1992\n \n I read your book. When you get through, you [a reader] say, \"If I could just get a nuclear device inside Foggy Bottom, I think that's the answer.\" I mean, you get through this, and you say, \"We've got to blow that thing up.\" I mean, is it as bad as you say?\n -- Pat Robertson, to syndicated columnist Joel Mowbray, author of Dangerous Diplomacy: How the State Department Endangers National Security; the U.S. Department of State is located in Foggy Bottom, a Washington, D.C., neighborhood; \"Foggy Bottom\" is sometimes used as a synonym for Washington, DC., quoted from AANEWS (October, 2003) \u0086\u0086",

   "I understand your position. Robertson does not speak for you. Problem is, he's an alleged spokesperson for the American Christian community or at least a big chunk of it. Whether or not he actually is becomes somewhat irrelevant - it's the perception or the image that counts. And in that regard, with his recent statements, Robertson has, in my opinion, given American Christianity a black eye. \n \n I'm glad to see that his remarks have drawn opposition from other representatives of the Christian community and that he is now engaged in damage control.\n\n Yeah, he reminds me of that doctor on the original Lost in Space, who would always run behind the little boy when danger was at hand; only Robertson uses the \"faith\" of a whole nation. Not a good idea. I sincerely hope he gets equal treatment as the cowardly doc.\n \nBTW, the Aug 22 issue of The New Yorker has an extensive article on Billy Graham. I never paid much attention to the guy but I found the article to be fascinating. It caused me to raise my estimate of him up a notch or two.\n\n He's not perfect by any means, but he doesn't pretend to be. I think he's honest and sincere - even though he's stumbled a time or two himself on the political cobblestones. At least he doesn't rant and rave, then run and hide behind religion.",

   "Revisiting Liberal Myths - Reagan and the Deficit\n \n President Reagan entered the White House with an attitude of working honest deals with the Congress on spending. He wanted more defense spending, lower entitlement spending, lower tax rates which would boost the economy (and thus revenues) and seemed to achieve that agreement with Congress in both 1981 and 1982. However, despite getting concessions on taxes, the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives never once cut spending, and the actual budgets were higher than what Reagan asked for 7 out of 8 years. This attitude of \"cut spending later\" helped continue the debt trends that began under Ford and Carter. By the end of Reagans terms, debt had increased by $2 trillion.\n \n Actual budget figures in the link below:\n \n http://www.presidentreagan.info/reagan_budgets.cfm\n \n President Reagan was able to sign into law the tax cuts in late 1981 after an attempt by congressional Democrats to block the cuts (i.e. \"gridlock\") failed...but at the reduced rate of 25%, and an effective rate of 23% since the cuts would be over three years (5% in 1981, retroactive; 10% for 1982; 10% for 1983). \n \n All taxpayers received these cuts, not just the rich as anti-Reagan revisionists would have you believe, as shown in the table of effective tax rates. And, also contrary to liberal recounting, the tax cuts helped spur the economy (see the expansion). In addition, income tax revenues increased during this period and the share of taxes paid by the rich increased also! In other words, the liberals have been lying to you. \n \n http://www.presidentreagan.info/tax_cuts.cfm\n \n The smallest amount by which a Reagan budget was increased by the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives was $50 billion. The government shut down on numerous occasions because of budget battles between Reagan and Congress. Interestingly, back then no one blamed the Speaker of the House for shutting down the government. They blamed the President. \n \n When Reagan's tax plan was passed in 1982, there were supposed to be two dollars in spending cuts for every dollar of tax cuts. But spending never got cut. In the end, for every new dollar of tax revenue, the Democrats spent $1.80. Rather than cut spending, they let the government shut down and blamed Reagan.  \n http://www.cdharris.net/text/taxcuts.html\n \n Clinton\n \n In 1995, GOP congressional leaders had to push Clinton to submit five budgets before he would agree to a balanced-budget plan and he actually vetoed two balanced budgets.\n \n It remains a matter of record that the Republican Congress turned what was going to be a $3.9 trillion increase in the national debt into some $2 trillion in surpluses over the same period, a dramatic turnaround that Clinton and Gore were not hoping to engineer though they now wish to take full credit for it. \n Furthermore, Clinton took an economy that was growing at a 4 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 1992 and with his record 1993 tax increase managed to depress that growth rate to 2.4 percent annually throughout his first term. The Clinton tax increase is not what ultimately led to the balanced budget (again, there was no plan for a balanced budget until the Republicans took over Congress) and it in fact cost Americans $300 billion in output, $264 billion in disposable income, $138 billion in savings and 1.2 million jobs. The economy did not again resume 4 percent annual growth until after the Republican Congress finally got Clinton to sign a capital-gains tax cut.  \n \n Watch out for the Liberal's Revisionism!",

The last period of US Republican sanity.\n \n The dot.com bubble aside (where primarily workers sucked into 401k American Dream World took the hit), the country was in the process of managing a steady transfer of productivity to offshore sources and migration to a service economy, as predicted by Volcker and his shaping of Fed policy.
