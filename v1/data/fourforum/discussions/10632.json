   "Posted by Supersport in CARM but later deleted by the Moderator out of embarrassment such a peson belongs in their camp.\n Starlight: wait just a dad-gum minute!\n Post #1\n supersport\n \n \n Something occurred to me to day that makes me believe that the whole starlight \"problem\" is....shall we say, bunk. Long-agers like to hammer Christians with the issue of how in the world light from stars situated millions of light years away could make it to the earth in 10,000 years or less.\n \n I'm sorry to have to do this but I'm going to just have to break down and bring out a bit of logic and common sense for everyone to chew on. So, let's all clear our minds, hold hands, and think through this real slowly for just a moment.\n \n The speed of light has a documented speed....a speed that can be measured. For example, if I were to stand where I live in Ft Worth Texas and shine a flashlight to a friend of mine standing on the sun, the light would take a short amount of time to arrive at the sun, right? I don't know how long this period of time would be (I think it's a few seconds) but that's not what's important. What's important is that light can be measured and travels at a specific speed....or so some say.\n \n Let's continue. Sound is the same way. If I were to stand in Ft Worth Texas and fire off a shotgun, it would take a while for that sound to reach Houston...(assuming this was a very loud shotgun). Probably many seconds. So once again, sound -- just like light -- can be measured and travels at a specific speed.\n \n Still with me? Great.....hang tight, here's where it gets good.\n \n Now let's play like one of my kids is standing 10 feet in front of me doing jumping jacks. Would you agree that I see her in real time?...that there is no delayed reaction in my seeing her? Great. Now picture her standing a thousand feet away from me doing jumping jacks. I can still see her in real time, right?....even though I'm near-sighted, and she might be a bit blurry, there is no actual delay. So in other words there is no measurable difference in vision -- there is no difference between watching my daughter do jumping jacks 10 feet away and watching her do jumping jacks 1000 feet away. Still with me?\n \n Now let's move her to New York. I'm still in Ft. Worth. Now she's on top of the Empire State building doing jumping jacks. Granted, because of the great distance and the curvature of the earth I could not normally see her jumping. However, if I happened to have Superman eyes and I could somehow see around the curvature of the earth, I would STLL see her jumping in real time. RIGHT?? Right. There is no delay. Put another way: delay = 0 when it comes to sight.\n \n So if delay is equal to zero when it comes to site then it doesn't matter if my daughter is jumping 10 feet away or 90 trillion feet away. 90 trillion times zero is STILL zero.\n \n So let's now say my daughter is wearing a heat-resistant suit and is now jumping on the sun. If my vision was good enough and if I wore my shades I could see her jumping in real time, right? Right. As you can see, distance isn't the problem, vision is the problem....perception is the problem.\n \n Now let's move to stars that are situated billions of light years away. And let's say that I was blessed with freak vision, and my eyes randomly mutated into telescopes similar to the Hubble. If my daughter was jumping on a far-distant star, would I not still see her jumping in REAL TIME???????? Of course! Distance isn't the issue: the ability to see the object IS the issue.\n \n So ultimately measuring the speed of light and claiming that it must have taken billions of years to travel to the earth is bunk!\n \n The reason we can see far-distant stars is not because the light traveled to us, but because the star is so dang big and bright we can see it with our own eyes! We can see the actual real-time fireball because the fireball is so huge. The idea that we would have to wait to see a beam of light travel from the far-distant star to us before we could see that far-distant star is incorrect as I see it because SIGHT has no speed limit. When you look up in the sky, you are not seeing billion-year-old light rays, you are seeing the actual star in real time.\n \n What you are not seeing are these so-called light \"beams\" or \"rays\" that science is so obsessed with measuring. Think about it, when you see a star in the sky, you are watching the actual star, not some light beam. You can see the star with your own eyes because the star is close enough for you to do so.\n \n If the above is true, then there is no such thing as a starlight problem. When God created the world, he created some stars that were able to be seen and some that weren't. We can only see what we can see -- but this is only limited to our ability to see.",

   "The rest of the hilarity/tragedy\n #11\n supersport\n \n how can you say there is a delay in sight?\n \n #13\n supersport\n \n wrong, if I see someone jumping on the sun I would see them in real time. I would not have to wait for their \"rays\" to get here.\n \n #16\n supersport\n \n So you are saying sight is limited to the speed of light?\n \n #23\n supersport\n \n Now let's move to stars that are situated billions of light years away. And let's say that I was blessed with freak vision, and my eyes randomly mutated into telescopes similar to the Hubble. If my daughter was jumping on a far-distant star, would I not still see her jumping in REAL TIME???????? Of course! Distance isn't the issue: the ability to see the object IS the issue.\n \n #27\n supersport\n \n so if kids were lined up from here to the sun, all doing jumping jacks at the exact same time (put on a timer) are you telling me I would see them in off-time?\n \n #34\n supersport\n \n \"needing to see things\" is not the issue....it doesn't matter what my visual abilities are here. The issue is if someone is standing on a distant planet and started jumping if there would be a delay of that vision reaching the earth....and why.\n \n #43\n supersport\n \n you guys are getting screwed up by confusing the issue. Let's take light out.\n \n Let's say someone is jumping on the moon in complete darkness (dark side of the moon). Now let's say someone situated on the planet Pluto is watching....(someone who can see through the dark) How long will it take him to be able to \"see\" the jumping? Remember, there is no light involved. it would be instantaneous if he could see that far.\n \n #57\n supersport\n \n You are assuming that the light has to travel to us, when in reality our eyes can see going in the direction of the object. You are forgetting this. When I see my daughter jumping I don't have to wait for her image to get to me....this is absurd. I can see her jumping in real time.\n \n #61\n supersport\n \n sorry, man, but light is not the issue...and neither is being able to see. The issue is whether or not the image of something experiences a delay over distance. If there was a big green monster jumping on the moon, we could all see it in real time if it was big enough.\n \n #66\n supersport\n \n because I, standing on the earth, do not have to \"wait\" for that image to get here -- I can see it with my own eyes.\n \n #73\n supersport\n \n wait -- stop right there at \"there is no speed of sight...\" What do you mean by that. You mean you cannot see in front of yourself?\n \n #78\n supersport\n \n You are comparing apples to oranges. I am not talking about the speed of light. I'm talking about an object and if its image experiences a delay the further away you get. I don't think it does.\n \n #86\n supersport\n \n let's try this again\n Let's play like there's a big green monster on the moon. This monster is so big that he is just as big as the moon and he's hopping up and down on it....(he's also light as a feather)..........however, watching from earth, how exactly is it that we do not see him jumping up and down in real time?\n \n Now let's say he shoots a lazer out of his eyes towards the earth -- sure enough, it may take a bit for the light to travel here. But that is NOT THE SAME as me viewing the monster from the earth....there is no travel or waiting needed for me to see the monster jumping in real time....the monster is not traveling.\n \n #91\n supersport\n \n I am looking at the source of the lazer, you are looking at the beam coming towards you.\n \n #99\n supersport\n \n so when a big green monster is jumping on the moon, do you think there is an \"image\" of that green monster travelling to the earth? Keeping mind that \"image\" is a visual thing that humans experience. But their is no image of a green monster going anywhere.......the monster is jumping on the moon and is staying on the moon. Any light reflected might shine somewhere else, but the image itself doesn't go anywhere........as a human I simply see it....I don't see an \"image\" of it.\n \n #107\n supersport\n \n Yes it does. In order to have a visual image, you need an image maker. Your brain/mind is the image maker. there is no \"visual image\" that exists.\n \n Something might exist but it is not a \"visual image\".\n I stand to be corrected here though.\n so if a tree falls in the woods do you need to be for there to be a visual image of it?\n \n #116\n supersport\n \n Quote:\n ok let's say there is a black hole over the jumper...therefore no light reflected. If I viewed this black hole from Texas, would I not be seeing it in real time?\n \n #128\n supersport\n \n play like the light is actually a big round black hole --- the hole has no reflection, yet we can still see it....say if we \"bounce\" this hole like a basketball on the moon....then what? Would we not see this bounce in real time? why not?\n \n \n #129\n supersport\n \n you guys keep saying that what we see is all reflected light --- if that were true, then nothing we see would be real -- it would only be a reflection. I don't see how this could be true.\n \n #140\n supersport\n \n I didn't say objects don't reflect light....what I'm saying is that sight doesn't have a speed limit, only a \"see limit\" or perception limit.\n \n #141\n supersport\n \n oh I think I get it...\n You guys think images have to come to us...while I think our eyes go to the image! Am I right?\n \n #145\n supersport\n \n but there is no image \"coming\" my eyes go get it!\n \n #148\n supersport\n \n by seeing I pretty much am \"shooting my eyeballs\" out into the distance.\n \n #154\n supersport\n \n stop there....but you are assuming that the lightwave has to travel to us....why can it not be that my eyes travel to it?...\n \n #170\n supersport\n \n I'm still hung up with how it is that when we see an image -- such as a hot air balloon in the sky, that what we see is not reality, that it's just a reflection of reality -- a reflection that if pushed back out into space far enough would be appear different than what it really was.\n \n #174\n supersport\n \n so you guys are telling me....\n \n If I perched myself up on a high enough tower in Ft worth, and I peered across the nation to New York only to see my kiddo doing jumping jacks on the Empire state building that what I'd be seeing is not really her in real-time?\n \n #183\n supersport\n \n hmmmm.....are you also saying it doesn't matter how powerful my eyes are? What if I had telescope eyes?\n \n #194\n supersport\n \n so if there were someone doing jumping jacks on the sun and I had a super high-powered telescope I would not be able to watch real-time jumping????\n \n #197\n supersport\n \n so what happens when there's an eclipse? Are we not seeing it in real time?\n \n #202\n supersport\n \n the thing is though, I can see across the whole horizon of the sky at the same time. Go out far enough and I can see billions of miles out instantly...(not stars, miles) If I can see billions of miles instantly, why can't I see the sun instantly?\n \n #209\n supersport\n \n how do billions of miles of empty space \"get to me?\" I simply look out and see them.\n \n #216\n supersport\n \n I can see all the miles between here and a star.\n \n #219\n supersport\n \n fine...who cares.....that's not the topic....I don't doubt that it takes light time to travel...I'm simply saying it doesn't take my sight time to travel.\n \n \n ",

It is my research you are falsely using to support you arguments. Please do not reference my work in this way in the future.\n \n Your interpretation of the plastic responses of tadpoles to chemicals produced by predators is false. Much research (not my own, look for research by Robert Denver) has shown that chemicals in the water produced by predators when feeding on prey, or changing environments in general, activate pathways in the body which in turn lead to increased tail size and differentiation of color. It has nothing to do with the tadpoles \"desire\" to have a larger or redder tail, it is simply a physiological response. The tadpoles have not \"evolved\" during the course of their development, as you assert. An induced phenotype is not heritable, the ability to induce it is. The tadpoles with the red tails will not produce red tailed tadpoles when they are adults. Those with clear tails will not produce clear tailed tadpoles. They will both produce tadpoles that have the ability to make either phenotype. \n \n -Justin \n",
