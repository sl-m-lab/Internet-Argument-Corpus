   "It is obvious that both the female egg and the male sperm have a form of life but no one would call either a \"person\". When they unite to form a zygote we certainly have a form of life. There is a potential person there and a great many people would claim that it actually is a person.\n \n Let us grant for a moment that the zygote is a person and let us call that person Mary. Now, we all know that a zygote develops into an embryo through the process of cell division. Every now and again the first cell division does not produce a two celled embryo but rather a second zygote --- twins. Did Mary suddenly become two persons? Was Mary two persons to begin with? Was Mary even a person to begin with?\n \n Let us set those questions aside for the moment and grant that the second zygote is also a person whom we shall call Margaret. It is entirely possible that one or both of these zygotes could divide again to result in triplets, quadruplets, quintuplets etc. The same question applies as to whether one person can became two, three or more persons. When does a person become a person?\n \n These questions might be difficult enough but now it becomes even more complex. Rarely the two zygotes (Mary and Margaret) merge together again to form a two celled embryo. This is called a \"chimera\". Who is this new embryo? Is it Mary or is it Margaret? This new embryo, this chimera, let us call it Mary, develops to term and is born. There is now no question at all that Mary is indeed a person. But here is the odd thing, some of the organs of Mary carry her genes but other organs carry the genes of her twin sister Margaret. So Margaret continues to exist within Mary or perhaps it is Mary within Margaret. Do we have two persons within a single body?\n \n These very serious questions of personhood arise only if we assume that the soul is infused at conception (as many Christian groups do) and that the brand new zygote is fully a person. Is there a more reasonable understanding? I believe there is. Personally I believe that the developing fetus becomes a person only when it is able to survive outside the womb. This happens very late in the second trimester. For this reason I am against abortion beyond the twentieth week. Otherwise I believe that abortion should be legal, it should be safe, it should be available and it should be the woman's informed choice but most important of all --- it should be rare.",

   "The wording of this thread intrigues me. I see that many here jump in and start arguing about \"when\" a person begins. Is it not possible to define it in the opposite? Aren't things able to be understood by looking at a thing and saying \"this is not.....\" as well as looking at them and saying \"this is....\"?\n \n I can look at a basketball sized vegetable that is orange in color and say \"This is a pumpkin\". I can also define it and say \"This is not a tennis racket\".\n \n I say this in context of the title of this thread. If you can define a person by \"when\" it begins, certainly you will be able to define it in terms of \"when\" it ends. \n \n Since time is a relevant thing, it is defined as a point in space. Movement. If nothing moves, time doesn't either. If things move forward, time does also. If things move backwards, time does as well.\n \n So let's look at a bouncing baby boy at the age of one day. Certainly, this baby is defined as a person, right? Wouldn't ending it's life be murder at this point? Let's go back to yesterday. This little baby has just been born and it's umbilical has just been cut. Is it still a person? Nothing has changed in the previous day. It is still the baby it will be tomorrow. Let's take a minute by minute reversal. Let's go back just another few minutes. Now the umbilical cord is still attached. Is it still a person? Let's slow down now. If you cam imagine the little baby turning upside down and heading feet first towards the birth canal, has it stopped being a person? Let's slow down a little slower. Second by second. We are talking about when a person begins, right? It now returns, feet first into the mother. We've established that it is still a person as the umbilical reattaches. Now, as we revert, second by second, the feet enter...is it still a person? Let's slow down to a crawl. Imagine a film reel going backwards frame by frame as the baby returns toward the womb. In go the knees. Now it's up to it's waist, hands, arms, neck.........chin.....nose.....we slowly see the head start to dissapear....\n \n Pick any second and tell me when to kill it.\n \n After all, if it becomes a person at a particular split second going forward in time, it will certainly stop being one at some point going backward, right? I would really like to know, not only the moment that it stops being a person, but what changed from the moment just preceeding it that caused it's humanity to stop existing.",

   "Since I've been on this forum this question has been asked a zillion times with the same arguments. What I've come to realize is that a definition doesn't matter. You can define \"fruit\" however you want but an apple will still be an apple. In fact, you can define apple however you want and the apple won't change. \"Human\" or \"person\" are just words to describe something. They don't give value. You can unquestionable call an unborn a human or person as this is an accepted definition in a dictionary which is basically a commonly agreed upon convention. This doesn't prove a damn thing though. It gives no value.\n\n \n Correct. Words are mearly descriptions of the original article. They are like macros used in computer software. They cannot change or dictate meaning. Words have no meaning in that sense. When the dictionary says \"meaning\", it really means \"definition\". Its slang.\n \n \nNow, when you start talking about value you can get somewhere. Of course this presents a problem for those people who have no way to judge value...yeah, I'm talking to the atheists of the group. Sorry, but it is true.\n \n\n I am an atheist.

They are nourished within the testes and epididymis until they are released via ejaculation. Once the sperm leaves the male body, however, its days are numbered. Sperm carry enough energy to complete the task of reaching the ovum and fertilizing it, but they lack the capacity to take on new nutrients. If a sperm cell fails to fuse with an ovum, it will eventually die and decompose.\n \n Sperm cells are difficult to think of as alive, but they meet the criteria, and so they are. I hope that helps.

   " 1;It is obvious that both the female egg and the male sperm have a form of life but no one would call either a \"person\". 2 When they unite to form a zygote we certainly have a (new) form of life. There is (at least) a potential person there and 3a great many people would claim that it actually is a person.\n\n \n \n 4 Let us grant for a moment that the zygote is a person and let us call that person Mary. Now, we all know that a zygote develops into an embryo through the process of cell division. 5 Every now and again the first cell division does not produce a two celled embryo but rather a second zygote ---twins. 6 Did Mary suddenly become two persons? 7 Was Mary two persons to begin with? 8 Was Mary even a person to begin with?\n\n \n \n Let us set those questions aside for the moment and grant that the second zygote is also a person whom we shall call Margaret. It is entirely possible that one or both of these zygotes could divide again to result in triplets, quadruplets, quintuplets etc. 9 The same question applies as to whether one person can became two, three or more persons. 10 When does a person become a person?\n\n \n These questions might be difficult enough but now it becomes even more complex. Rarely the two zygotes (Mary and Margaret) merge together again to form a two celled embryo. This is called a \"chimera\". Who is this new embryo? Is it Mary or is it Margaret? This new embryo, this chimera, let us call it Mary, develops to term and is born. There is now no question at all that Mary is indeed a person. But here is the odd thing, some of the organs of Mary carry her genes but other organs carry the genes of her twin sister Margaret. So Margaret continues to exist within Mary or perhaps it is Mary within Margaret. Do we have two persons within a single body?\n \n These very serious questions of personhood arise only if we assume that the soul is infused at conception (as many Christian groups do) and that the brand new zygote is fully a person. Is there a more reasonable understanding? I believe there is. Personally I believe that the developing fetus becomes a person only when it is able to survive outside the womb. This happens very late in the second trimester. For this reason I am against abortion beyond the twentieth week. Otherwise I believe that abortion should be legal, it should be safe, it should be available and it should be the woman's informed choice but most important of all --- it should be rare.[/QUOTE]\n \n Work in progress",

Although all My science references are 100% correct, you dont specify what you are even talking bout.\n \n \nFurther further furthermore, I was simply using the definition of 'reproduction' that you used before. No definition of 'life' was mentioned at that point.\n \n\n So what? Why would that matter if that was the case?\n \n Quote : \nSeer Travis : Its all perfectly simple : Reproduction always produces a new member of the same species, a new life form.\n\n \n \nNot at all. I am suggesting that a life needs to be created, but the scientific definition of reproduction states that this process of creation takes place over a period of time.\n\n No it does not. Life is created at conception. Wrong answer. You did not read the OP properly. You argued it was human, not a human being. My above post proves otherwise.\n \n \nAgain, it's not 'life' but 'a life'. A life ends at death - which, incidentally, does not refer to deletion of DNA or cessation of existence or being, but simply irreversible brain failure. If you wish to talk about death as a suitable point for judging the start of life, you are onto a loser.\n \n\n I never suggested that. You are just unwilling to accept the meaning of My words, because that would result in facing Truth.\n \n \nIn other words, your Truth is an arbitrary definition that you make up and then judge all evidence against as to their validity.\n \n\n Incorrect. The only arbitrary judgements against evidence made are those by you and society.",

   "Ian, this is your final chance. Stop dodging, lying, changing what I said etc.\n \n The womb-trapped child is a human being, at all stages, when it is in the womb.\n \n Yes or no? Answer yes or no, stop dodging. And don't try this \"Oh...its not a womb trapped child...\" semantic dodge. You know exactly what is being asked.\n \n It is a life-form. It is a human being life form (the lowest and most inferior form on the planet).\n \n There is no such thing as a \"person\" in the way you describe. What you want to really say is that it is not able to think etc at this stage, ie its not conscious or self-aware. Thats what you really want to argue. You just know that you cannot win that argument with Me.\n \n Now, the fact remains that you really want to support murdering WTChildren because you ultimately know they are not broken or able to be abused by society.

Why was I not\n Adopted? Could not someone else enjoy watching me grow up \n to be a delightful girl or boy? Why did you slay me Mother?\n Why not let me live?
