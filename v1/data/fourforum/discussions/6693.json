The netherlands also doesn't have a large police force which might not help things either. \n Finally, I said \"HANG ON\" to a moral code. I didn't say we had a moral code. Seems everytime someone wants to limit an action liberals cry out \"don't impose your moral code on me\". The double talk is the liberals though. Not imposing a moral code is imposing a moral code. Someone asked how laws are a moral code. Well prostitution is a moral thing and its illegal. Murder is a moral thing and its illegal. Many laws we have are because we just think it is wrong. Murder, theft, and prostitution happen to all be things we think are wrong and in order to have good conduct, we make them illegal. An example of a non-moral code (for the most part) is the tax-code.\n\n \n We also think adultery is wrong.....it is legal\n We think sleeping around is wrong......legal\n We think getting drunk is wrong............legal (unless while driving)\n We think smoking is wrong............legal\n We think spanking is wrong.........legal (for now)\n We think stealing is wrong and it is illegal like you said unless the government is the ones stealing.\n We think homelessness is wrong but we do nothing to help them.\n We think underage pregnancy is wrong.......but we do not help them.\n We think poverty is wrong but it is ok to pay next to nothing for the workers or outsource our jobs to other countries where they can work for wages that would be illegal in the states and give them tax breaks to do it.\n I am so glad you did not say we had a moral code.\n Maybe we should hold on to the moral code instead things are going so well by holding on to them in that way.\n Yes that is sarcasm for those who did not notice it.\n But maybe we can show the world how much better we are then they are by making our citizens the healthiest,smartest,richest and most beautiful.\n Lets make these laws\n Things that would be illegal.\n Smoking,Drinking alcohol,Drinking soda (bad for your health),gambling,prostitution,eating meat,junk food,fast foods,pizza,getting less than 8 hours sleep,having sex with someone other than a spouse,watching anything even slightly pornographic,divorce,swearing,working as a laborer (in america we should all be business owners....let other countries supply the workers).\n And these would be mandatory \n School from kindergarten through 15th grade and then 8 years of college, everyone needs plastic surgery if they do not look good (based on standards),heterosexuality,monogamy,have no less than 2 children,going to church.\n There......that isn't liberal is it?\n I believe in our rights to live our own life as long as nobody tells me how I can live or stops me from living or takes from me what I earned so be it.",

But with the sex \"business\" spawning cross-border trafficking in women and children and boosting organized crime across Europe, we can no longer turn a blind eye to this problem.\n \n As prostitution becomes more prevalent, it's also becoming more accepted. During this summer's World Cup, the city of Bremen estimates an influx of 30,000 - 40,000 prostitutes to Germany for the four-week tournament. Taking a lead from the Athens Olympic Games, the authorities in Cologne put up a complex of custom-built cabins outside the city, so men can buy access to women's bodies without tarnishing the host's good reputation.\n \n But where will Germany find those thousands of women? The growing demand for commercial sex in Germany and the rest of the Continent can't be met by women from within the European Union alone. According to a 2003 London Metropolitan University study, 60-90% of prostitutes in the EU are foreigners. Trafficking in women and children is a key element of the sex industry. In its newly released report on forced labor, the International Labor Organization estimates that there are more than 250,000 sex slaves in industrialized countries.\n \n Some \"progressive\" campaigners have, especially over the past 15 years, argued that the legalization and regulation of prostitution could reduce trafficking and help combat organized crime and money laundering that usually come with it. By making prostitution a job like any other, with \"sexworkers\" rights and better conditions, the state would break the link between prostitution and organized crime. Where women would no longer live and work in the black market, or so goes the argument, they'd feel comfortable enough to report attacks on them to the police, while the police itself could devote more resources to fight still illegal trafficking and child prostitution. As icing on the cake, the tax revenues from prostitutes would go to the state. In the Netherlands, the sex industry accounts for an estimated 5% of gross domestic product. In Cologne, the municipality introduced two years ago a \"sex tax\" of \u0080150 per prostitute, per month. This is on top of the income tax licensed prostitutes must pay.\n \n But can we consider \"sex work\" like any other mainstream economic activity, whose profits should be integrated into the nation's GDP, maybe even giving training for young people or the unemployed?\n \n The answer is a definite no. The sex trade is predominantly in the economic interests of sex traders and takes place at the expense of the prostitutes. What's more, while liberalization may have opened up new revenue sources for the government, it has done little to combat trafficking or organized crime. As a matter of fact, it has made the situation worse. Since 2001, the first year when the Dutch lifted a legal ban on brothels (prostitution itself was decriminalized long before), the sex industry saw a 25% increase in revenue, according to Janice Raymond from the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women. The Dutch NGO ChildRight estimates that the number of underage prostitutes rose to 15,000 in 2001 from 4,000 in 1996.\n \n Other countries with a \"liberal\" approach toward prostitution have had similar experiences. Richard Poulin, a University of Ottawa sociologist, estimates that in Denmark the number of victims of trafficking has risen tenfold during the last decade, while in Greece 20,000 people are now being trafficked into the country every year, up from 2,100 in the early '90s.\n \n The reason why legalizing prostitution doesn't work is easy to understand. By decriminalizing the sex industry, these countries have lowered the threshold for men to seek commercial sex. Where legal barriers disappear, so do the social and ethical barriers to treating women as objects. And like any other \"normal\" business, sex traders are always trying to increase their profit margins by getting cheap \"labor,\" mostly from Eastern and Central Europe.\n \n (More)",

   "What could be done instead? In January 1999, Sweden introduced a new law that best reflects the reality of this business and had the most success in curtailing the abuse of women. The law treats the customers, but not the prostitutes, as criminals. That it is a crime to buy but not to sell sex makes the law unique. It acknowledges the reality of prostitution, doing away with the myth of \"free choice.\" Women trafficked for prostitution are always victims of sexual abuse and violence and are not criminals.\n \n According to Kajsa Wahlberg, a police officer at Sweden's National Criminal Investigation Department, the law had a tremendous impact. Previously pimps could simply give women mobile phones and send them out on the streets. But now they have to find a \"business locale\" and solicit customers. By 2001, street prostitution had declined 70-80% and prostitution in clubs, hotels and other indoor facilities was reduced by half. It has also resulted in a greater awareness and willingness of the police and prosecutors to investigate and prosecute pimps and traffickers.\n \n The law also helped to limit trafficking. Some 400-600 women are now brought to Sweden each year, according to the government. This compares to around 3,000 trafficked prostitutes in much smaller Denmark.\n \n Between 1999 and April 2004, 734 men have been arrested for purchasing sexual services, out of whom 140 have been convicted. The Swedish Supreme Court has set a 50-day minimum sentence, which can go up to 150 days for repeat offenders.\n \n The Swedish legislation offers some hope for the rest of Europe. Although legislation on prostitution is the domain of member states, trafficking is obviously a cross-border issue and must be addressed at the EU level. Europe has to scrutinize its existing policies without confusing trafficking with illegal immigration. It must tackle the root causes of trafficking, which are found in the persistence of gender inequalities, poverty and the limited life choices for women. It must develop policies and measures to improve women's position in society both inside and outside the EU.\n \n Strategies to confront trafficking need to address the needs of the women whose rights are violated as well as targeting the pimps, clients and others who benefit from the sex trade. Saying \"no\" to trafficking and exploitation of women by pimps and clients has nothing to do with \"conservative\" sexual politics. On the contrary. It is those who legalize the sex industry and legitimize the reduction of women to mere objects who pursue archaic politics -- no matter how \"progressive\" they claim to be.\n \n Ms. De Troy is coordinator of the European Women's Lobby's Policy Action Center on Violence Against Women, based in Brussels.
