   "In a recent post, Easyrider suggested that \"there's a long, long list of sins...\" I am starting this thread to discuss the idea of sin. Is the concept of sin an objective concept for which there really is a definitive list? Or is the concept a little more fuzzy and situational?\n \n I suggest that the concept of sin was invented by humanity. (Possibly to explain away the perceived 'problems' of the world.) There is no objective 'list,' or... if by some chance there is, then we have no way of knowing what specifically is on the list and what is not on the list.\n \n Feel free to share your thoughts... or to share your perceived 'list' of sins so that we can compare how many different lists are out there. :)",

Why does one particular version of God have a monopoly on sin?\n \n o Working on the Sabbath? =< Jesus said doing good on the sabbath (including work) is not breaking the commandment (which is to keep the sabbath holy) = not sin\n BF: What if your job that you work on Sundays is helping elderly folks at a nursing home... but the sole reason you work that job on Sundays is so that you can afford to get drunk on Friday nights with your friends?\n \n o Abortion? = murder = sin\n BF: Abortion does not equal murder. Murder is a legal term. Murder is not legal. Abortion is legal. So... the question still remains --< Is abortion a sin?\n \n o Masturbation? = against God's commandment = sin\n BF: Which commandment is this? Where is it written? Is it explicit? (e.g. \"Thou shalt not masturbate\")\n \n o Consuming alcohol? =< the commandment is \"do not be drunk with wine\" =< drinking alcohol in itself is not a sin\n BF: That doesn't sound very explicit to me... does that mean it's not a sin to be drunk with vodka or rum?\n \n o Yelling at someone in anger? =< \"be angry and sin not\" =< yelling is not a sin (swearing, abusing, etc would be a sin)\n BF: How can love be present when anger is present? Love gets replaced by anger (at least temporarily) when one shows anger. Yet God's commandment is to \"Love one another.\" If we fail to love one another by being angry with them, are we not sinning?\n \n o Suicide? = murder = sin\n BF: Again, murder is a legal term. As far as I'm aware, there are no laws prohibiting suicide. Therefore, suicide does not equal murder. And, in a sense, did not God commit suicide through Jesus? God is presumably all-powerful. God did not HAVE to have Jesus die on the cross for the redemption of sin. God could have accomplished this any number of other ways. Yet God allowed a part of God (Jesus) to be killed. This is suicide. (I would argue that making a conscious decision to allow oneself to die at the hands of others in a particular instance is just as much suicide as making a conscious decision to drive off a cliff or point a gun to your head.) Also... what about a person who sacrifices themselves so that others might live? Is this a sin? (Consider a stranded group of people with limited food and water knowing they will not have enough food for everyone to survive until they are rescued. One person consciously decides to stop eating food. They commit suicide so that the others have a better chance of survival. Is this a sin?)\n \n o Keeping slaves? = if you mean having people working for you for free with no consideration for their right, then = sin\n BF: Where is there a commandment against keeping slaves? I was under the impression that the bible condoned slavery. \n \n o Falling asleep on company time? (i.e. Stealing) = sin\n BF: What if the reason this individual is falling asleep is because they are a single parent, left by their spouse with their three children, who is working two jobs just to make ends meet... and the night before they fell asleep on the job, this parent was up all night caring for a sick child. Yet they simply do not have enough energy keep from dozing a few minutes during a slow time on their job. Is this a sin? (If so, your interpretation of sin is pretty harsh!)\n \n o Using the Lord's name in vain? = sin\n BF: And just what constitutes using the Lord's name in vain? Is that spelled out explicitly anywhere? Or is this up to interpretation? Is it okay to say, \"Oh my God!\" in surprise or in celebration? Is it okay to say, \"Jeez!\" (which presumably is an abbreviation of \"Jesus\")? What if one is not aware of the roots of the expression \"Jeez\"? Is it still a sin? Is it okay for a believe to say, \"Oh my God!\" but if a non-believer says the exact same thing, it is deemed a sin because they are not sincere? Does intention not count for anything in your 'objective' interpretation of sin?\n \n \ni think what most people get hung up over is a weird \"fear\" of being judged as sinful. as easy as it is to commit sin, it is equally easy to fix the problem. simply a matter of asking God forgiveness, and repenting (making a conscious effort to not sin anymore). problem solved. the whole process is quite simple\n\n But what if that person is uncertain whether they actually committed a sin? What if they don't have the same 'objective' understanding that you do of what a sin is? (I'm being intentionally facetious here to make a point... not to mock you in any way.)\n \n \nthe sin is in the guy that gave the kid the false impression about the existence of the easter bunny. he was the misleading one. the kid that told his froend about the easter bunny was acting honestly, not with a misleading intent. qed\n\n Here you are suggesting that sin is not objective. The moment you allow intentions to determine what is and is not a sin, then sin becomes quite subjective.\n \n \"Yeah, but, officer, my intentions were pure!\" (See how far that one gets you!)\n \n \nask forgiveness, repent, and youre back on track. simple isnt it?\n\n Well, except that if you know that you are already forgiven... you've never really fallen off any sort of track. You're just being you. You are being the best that you can be in that given moment. You are being who God created you to be.\n \n \nnone of these are transgressions of God's commandments, but questions of personal judgement, and therefore are not sin. of course, with growing wisdom comes better judgement, and better decisions (better steward, more discretion, etc). its still not a sin\n\n I thought that 'Sloth' (i.e. laziness) was one of the seven cardinal sins??? What if my intent in doing these things is to make the earth as inhospitable as possible for future generations? What if I am maliciously trying to destroy the earth... because if I can't enjoy it, I don't want anybody else to enjoy it either. \n \n Let's take the 'stewardship' idea a little farther... What if I drive that quarter-mile every day. As a result of my actions combined with everyone else's actions, more oil is consumed... and the one extra tanker that is needed because me and a bunch of other people drive a quarter-mile instead of walking everyday ends up spilling into the ocean... killing lots of wildlife, and two small children who eat something contaminated near the beach. Is it not considered a sin if the blame can be spread to the point that the specific perpetrators cannot be distinguished?\n \n What if I intentionally dump toxic waste into a river and animals die as a result? What if people die? Does it matter if I know in advance the probability that some people may die? Is there a specific probability at which point I can justify the action and it is not considered a sin? Where do you draw the line between a question of 'personal judgment' and 'sin'? \n \n \nsin is not subjective. its what it is regardless of who subscribes to it. however, taking sin into account is optional, in that you could go through life and never consider how your actions conform to God's instructions \n\n However, your interpretations of God's instructions are subjective. You can ask God for guidance in discerning sin... yet you will still come up many instances in which your interpretation is different than another individual's interpretation (who also asked God for discernment). And you will come up with actions that could be considered sinful in one instance, but not sinful in another instance. So... if we are unable to discern what truly is this objective sin that you speak of... how can we know whether there really is an objective sin?",

   "I didn't read all of the posts so if I am being redundant, please forgive me. I think there are two definitions of this word that are at the heart of the question. I think it is objectively definable. However, I would submit that we must look at it in terms of a religious question as this is the religion forum and would want to keep the question in context.\n \n Given that there are two definitions because there are two parts of speech to consider. Noun and Verb. Sin the noun, is not acts committed in disobedience to a rule. It is simply (and this is where all the arguments will hit I think) the nature of man that is separated from God.

These are acts which are in opposition to \"love the lord you god with all your heart mind strength and soul, and love your neighbor as yourself.\"\n \n To do this requirres dependence on God who is Love and defines what that means.

God did not HAVE to have Jesus die on the cross for the redemption of sin. God could have accomplished this any number of other ways. Yet God allowed a part of God (Jesus) to be killed. This is suicide. (I would argue that making a conscious decision to allow oneself to die at the hands of others in a particular instance is just as much suicide as making a conscious decision to drive off a cliff or point a gun to your head.) Also... what about a person who sacrifices themselves so that others might live? Is this a sin? (Consider a stranded group of people with limited food and water knowing they will not have enough food for everyone to survive until they are rescued. One person consciously decides to stop eating food. They commit suicide so that the others have a better chance of survival. Is this a sin?)\n \n UP: \"thou shall not kill\". pretty straight forward. killing yourself is killing. jesus did not commit suicide, he was killed by others, sinners.\n \n BF: Where is there a commandment against keeping slaves? I was under the impression that the bible condoned slavery. \n \n UP: there is nothing wrong with working for others or having others working for you. but abuse and oppression is a sin\n \n BF: What if the reason this individual is falling asleep is because they are a single parent, left by their spouse with their three children, who is working two jobs just to make ends meet... and the night before they fell asleep on the job, this parent was up all night caring for a sick child. Yet they simply do not have enough energy keep from dozing a few minutes during a slow time on their job. Is this a sin? (If so, your interpretation of sin is pretty harsh!)\n \n UP: stealing is a sin.\n \n BF: And just what constitutes using the Lord's name in vain? Is that spelled out explicitly anywhere? Or is this up to interpretation? Is it okay to say, \"Oh my God!\" in surprise or in celebration? Is it okay to say, \"Jeez!\" (which presumably is an abbreviation of \"Jesus\")? What if one is not aware of the roots of the expression \"Jeez\"? Is it still a sin? Is it okay for a believe to say, \"Oh my God!\" but if a non-believer says the exact same thing, it is deemed a sin because they are not sincere? Does intention not count for anything in your 'objective' interpretation of sin?\n \n UP: using God's name in circumstances when you are not directly calling on him. using expressions or oaths such as \"oh my God\", while not in prayer (an expression of surprise, extasy, etc) is using the lord's name in vain\n \n \nBut what if that person is uncertain whether they actually committed a sin? What if they don't have the same 'objective' understanding that you do of what a sin is? (I'm being intentionally facetious here to make a point... not to mock you in any way.)\n\n theres a solution to that too. when you pray, include the clause \"and please forgive me for any sin that i may have committed unaware, and help me to be more aware of my actions and your guidance\". something to that effect and you have nothing to worry about\n \n \nHere you are suggesting that sin is not objective. The moment you allow intentions to determine what is and is not a sin, then sin becomes quite subjective.\n \n \"Yeah, but, officer, my intentions were pure!\" (See how far that one gets you!)\n \n\n your definition of a lie was \"to create a false or misleading impression\". this in itself is dependent upon intent. if you tell someone something false, while you are misleading them, you are not \"creating a misleading impression\". the difference is subtle, but it has to do with intent. intent is not subjective, by the way. either the intention was there or it wasnt. you cant prove it, but it doesnt change the truth about it\n \n but of course, just to be safe, lets classify it as a sin. the prayer clause above will solve that problem\n \n \nWell, except that if you know that you are already forgiven... you've never really fallen off any sort of track. You're just being you. You are being the best that you can be in that given moment. You are being who God created you to be.\n\n huh?\n \n \nI thought that 'Sloth' (i.e. laziness) was one of the seven cardinal sins??? What if my intent in doing these things is to make the earth as inhospitable as possible for future generations? What if I am maliciously trying to destroy the earth... because if I can't enjoy it, I don't want anybody else to enjoy it either. \n \n Let's take the 'stewardship' idea a little farther... What if I drive that quarter-mile every day. As a result of my actions combined with everyone else's actions, more oil is consumed... and the one extra tanker that is needed because me and a bunch of other people drive a quarter-mile instead of walking everyday ends up spilling into the ocean... killing lots of wildlife, and two small children who eat something contaminated near the beach. Is it not considered a sin if the blame can be spread to the point that the specific perpetrators cannot be distinguished?\n\n no it is not. it is neither a sin to be driving the tanker that spilled, nor distributing the oil that filled the tanker, nor manufacturing the cars that require oil, nor owning and operating the facilities that mine the oil.\n \n \nWhat if I intentionally dump toxic waste into a river and animals die as a result? What if people die? Does it matter if I know in advance the probability that some people may die? Is there a specific probability at which point I can justify the action and it is not considered a sin? Where do you draw the line between a question of 'personal judgment' and 'sin'? \n\n this is recklessness, which is a sin\n \n \nHowever, your interpretations of God's instructions are subjective. You can ask God for guidance in discerning sin... yet you will still come up many instances in which your interpretation is different than another individual's interpretation (who also asked God for discernment). And you will come up with actions that could be considered sinful in one instance, but not sinful in another instance. So... if we are unable to discern what truly is this objective sin that you speak of... how can we know whether there really is an objective sin?\n\n at face value, the commandments are very straight forward and direct. no acrobatic interpretation necessary",
