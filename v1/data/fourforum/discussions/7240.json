If it is not worded specifically to overturn a judicial decision it is likely that a judge will not see it as such. That clause is only to prevent the public from circumventing the court. For instance, it does not prohibit a petition to ban the death penalty just because the court has handed down such penalties. It does prevent those groups from attempting to overturn a single conviction where such a penalty was metted out though. \n \n I think GLAD has an uphill battle with this approach. I think a better approach would be a 14th Amendment challenge. As it is it will be hard to convince SCOTUS that this case has federal merit for them to intervene if the case gets that far. If you want to challenge City Hall you need to do it in a way that the final decision is not one rendered by City Hall.

You need a reason to do this that meets constitutional muster and you simply do not have it.\n \n \nThe issue has never been whether or not people are getting to marry. Everyone can do that NOW. The issue is how a marriage is defined.\n\n \n And our system mandates that it cannot be defined in a law in a way that violates the Constitution of the United States. To avoid that, you need a compelling state interest.\n \n So what is it?",

Gay marriage is an expression of the legitimacy of their lifestyle (how they see it). You cannot outlaw such expression in this country (prior restraint) without a really, really good reason - such as Brennan descibed as a \"clear and present danger\" - a compelling state interest. Being the higher and tougher of the two standards, this is the bar any law defining marriage must pass.\n \n \n Outlawing gay marriage, whether directly or effectively through a definition of marriage, is in direct violation of our most sacred values as a country.

   "I guess you just don't like the American system of checks and balances. Equal Protection is a constitutional right. If the majority, through a legislature, makes a law that does not comport with constitutional requirements, the courts can overrule it. That's how it works, otherwise, why have guaranteed rights, if they can't be enforced?\n Checks and balances are fine...the courts are the weakest branch. The equal protection clause has two parts..in theory...a strict scrunity test and a rational basis test. up until 1950 or so, the equal protection clause was supposed to use the strict scrunity test for all issues dealing with race and a rational basis test for all others. Your idea of what equal protection makes it so 5 judges can decide what laws to impose on you. For example, the court could find a compelling interest to ban gay marriage. Would this satifly you that gay marriage is not a constitutional right? Secondly, you still haven't answered how a majority of people feeling a certain way is not a compelling state interest. Your definition would mean have to accept this if the judges were at all reasonable. Letting the majority of the people in a state pass a law is compelling state interest and a very good one too. Perhaps you should rephrase it to say \"a compelling judge interest\" because what you really mean to ask is if it is fair to the views of 5 people. These leads us to the court system today (as opposed to the one 50 years ago) that makes laws. For example the judges found it to be fair to give private land to another private owner(new london case). The judges found it fair to have minors get the dealth penalty but about 10 years later found it to be unfair now and thus the law is changed. So tell me, how is a majority of people making a law not in the interest of the state or democracy? Perhaps you wish to live by the whim of a 5 people but I do not.\n \n \nSo again, to justify prior restraint (and there is a free speech component to this issue) and get around equal protection, a law passed by a legislature, or resulting from a referendum, or any other means of majority representation, has to show a compelling state interest.\n The interest to maintain a democracy where the majority of people win.\n \n \nIt's not legally distinguishable from unconstitutional laws that used to ban interracial marriages.\n This goes back to the rational basis test and strict scrunity test. However, this is obviously not used anymore because it is ok to discriminate on race in some cases (think colleges) because 5 people think that is fair eventhough that is probably the clearest violation of the equal protection clause...it has to do with race and unequal treatment. Gay marriage doesn't deal with race just like 10yr olds marrying doesn't. Thus a rational basis test is in order which is the one that requires a compelling state interest....and thus a majority fills this requirement.",

   "That \"violation\" is unproven.\n\n \n Of course, we are talking through a crystal ball here. But \"the\" case is coming soon enough and these are the issues that are going to have to be dealt with. In my opinion, it is going to be very hard to get a law that effectively (or explicity) prevents gay marriage past the Constitution. This is why there is such talk about a constitutional amendment - its proponents know that they will probably otherwise lose in court.\n \n \nThat's not the point. Laws are only passed to prohibit behavior, not allow them. No one ever thought there would be a need to ever define marriage. Why would it, when it's between a man and a woman by it's very nature? But the gay lobby saw it was undefined and wants to use that loophole to get couple's benefits. \n\n \n What you think \"no one ever thought\" isn't really relevant. Even if it were true, it still isn't relevant. That this is a \"new\" issue or hasn't been raised before isn't relevant. They want to get married and have the same rights as married straight people. Give us a reason why not, and you better make it a good one.\n \n \nIt's sort of like someone who wants to legally be able to walk into a supermarket and walk out of the store with a basket of groceries without paying for them, so they rush to legally define the concept of \"purchasing\" to fit whatever they want it to be, so it will allow for their behavior. That way no one can really challenge what they are doing. Everyone understands what purchasing is--there's no need to define it in law. \n\n \n Now you are just getting ridiculous. This is not a honest comparison, when there are laws against larceny. \"Purchasing\" is defined by these laws, if not explicity defined. It is something that larceny is not. This is a ludicrous comparison, since homosexuality is not a crime. \n \n \nIf they wanted to get married, they'd be uniting opposite sex partners, since that's what society generally understands marriage to be. No, they want to redefine marriage to fit what they want to do. There's no way around it.\n\n \n Again, what society \"generally understands\" is not relevant here, not to mention that you are making a pretty grand assumption about what other people think. Even if they are redefining marriage, who says they can't? It's not like we haven't done it before.\n \n \nIt doesn't matter. The state isn't preventing a gay person from getting married because he can go out and get legally married anytime they want just like the rest of us. It's a moot point.\n\n \n Not true. In Florida, for example, there is a statute defining marriage as between a man and a woman. Gays cannot \"marry\" under this law. If it were a moot point we wouldn't be arguing about it.\n \n \nMarriage is an institution. By changing it to include other forms of unions other than what it's meant for it redefines it. No one is saying heterosexuals would have that changed for THEM, but why the unnecessary redefining? Why invade on an opposite-sex institution? Couple's benefits could be written into law for gay people a different way without redefining marriage to get it.\n\n \n Again, marriage is also a legal status that brings with it certain rights and privileges. And since when is \"unnecessary redefining\" a reason to deny one group of people the same rights as another? It IS necessary for them to enjoy the same rights as married heterosexuals, and to enable laws that require them to be treated the same. There is no rational argument against this. Civil unions could possible do it for the equal protection issue, but it still doesn't get you past the First Amendment issue - and that's the kicker.\n \n \nIf that's your reason, then finding ways to provide those rights, privileges, and special status outside of redefining marriage shouldn't be a problem for you. Marriage could remain for opposite-sex partners.\n\n \n Who says it wouldn't? How does expanding a definition work to restrict anyone subject to it? \n \n \nNah, that's not very compelling from a legal aspect. Such a precedent could allow pretty much ANY behavior to be defended from the standpoint of free speech (the 1st amendment). It's about speech, not behavior.\n\n \n No, it wouldn't (and it hasn't). There are many restrictions on free expression, they just have to meet this standard. A ban on gay marriage would not meet this standard.\n \n \nGay unions are NOT outlawed. No police will bar them from the chapel if they can find one that will allow them to have a uniting ceremony. Now they can't legally call it a marriage (except in Mass.) but that's a legal matter, not a matter of expression of intimacy.\n\n \n They cannot have the same rights as married people. It is a different legal status. They cannot own property as tenants by the entireties, they cannot avail themselves of the tools of divorce, they cannot get certain kinds of life and health insurance, they cannot sign DNR orders, or make medical decisions in many cases. Don't even get me started on probate and spousal elective shares. All of these are equal protection issues that could be covered by establishing civil unions, but again, you still have to deal with these peoples' free speech rights to call their relationship a marriage.\n \n What this boils down to is some people not liking the idea or not liking that it will be called marriage. That is not enough to form the basis of a law or policy. Sorry you don't like it that two guys can live together and say they are married and have the law treat them as such, but your preference or distaste for it does not create a justification for either outlawing it, or even to call it something different.

Since they would really have to meet both, it makes sense to just talk about it meeting the higher standard.\n \n I have always heard the \"compelling state interest test\" as being part of the 14th amendment in order to override a \"fundamental right\"(those rights that change...even though fundamental...that only the courts know)...but you are correct in saying it was first thought of with regards to free exercise clause. I also don't know of anyone that is arguing gay marriage on first amendment grounds.\n \n \nIF the court found a compelling state interest then it would be constitutional. Problem is, people are having a damnable time coming up with one.\n The problem with this is that a judge can find different things compelling...talk about getting personal views on the bench. You might have 5 judges that think keeping blacks and whites in different schools is a compelling state interest...to him... The only way you can NOT have the personal views of a judge decide what is a compelling state interest is to see what the people of the state feel is in their best interest. A vote would certainly cover that. But then again you can't have a vote everytime a court case comes up...so this is why the Warren court should have never created such a dumb standard...but when you get a politician on the bench that is what you get.\n \n \nBecause constitutional rights are implicated here - in that situation, what the majority wants is irrelevant. The majority could vote tomorrow to reinstate slavery, for example, but it wouldn't get past the Constitution, would it?\n \n Obviously not but the part of the constitution you are talking about here has nothing to do with your so called \"compelling state interest\". For the sake of arguement, here, I am saying this actually exists in the constitution, however, if it did you would find it in the equal protection clause and this is an equal protection case....not as \"abolishing slavery\" case...moreover, what if a judge did find a \"compelling state interest\" test in the 13th amendment...could we have slavery if the judges felt it was in the states best interest? Finally, if the majority of americans passed a law to reinstate slavery (assuming the use of the proper process) we could, in fact, have slavery via constitutional amendment.\n \n \nIt is not. \"Compelling state interest\" is a test created by the SCOTUS in deciding the constitutionality of certain kinds of laws. It doesn't have a thing to do with majority rule. Following your logic, the Constitution would be meaningless and ineffective - and unenforceable - as long and the majority was behind the legislation. That is a 100% incorrect view of how our system works.\n \n Oh, I agree that the \"compelling state interest\" test is illogical but my scenario for it is the only one that would keep a judges own personal views out of the system(which is what a judge is supposed to do). With no compelling state interest test you simply have a reasonable look at the constitution. Thus you would see that it is reasonable to say the 14th amendment applies to cases of race and only rationally to other cases. As I said, the courts are the weakest branch and the people should always prevail over the courts and all of government for that matter.\n \n \nYou are completely missing the point. This is Civics 101.\n What point? The point that 5 people know what is \"right\" and what is a \"compelling state interest\" because they are oh so wise, well beyond the level of the majority of voters. Oddly enough, I doubt your case would even be won on equal protection...much like the lawerence case, it would probably be won on due process clause. In fact, only O'Connor thought homosexual sodomy was an equal protection issue. \n \n This is kinda related...\n \n \nOur opinions applying the doctrine known as \"substantive due process\" hold that the Due Process Clause prohibits States from infringing fundamental liberty interests, unless the infringement is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest\n(from lawerence v texas with cited cases).\n \n This kinda shows how only \"fundamanetal rights\" are supposed to fall into the so called \"compelling state interest\". The courts in lawerence actually used a rational basis test but added in the compelling state interest with it...\n \n read...\n \n The Texas statute undeniably seeks to further the belief of its citizens that certain forms of sexual behavior are \"immoral and unacceptable,\" Bowers, supra, at 196-the same interest furthered by criminal laws against fornication, bigamy, adultery, adult incest, bestiality, and obscenity. Bowers held that this was a legitimate state interest. The Court today reaches the opposite conclusion. The Texas statute, it says, \"furthers no legitimate state interest which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual,\" ante, at 18 (emphasis addded). The Court embraces instead Justice Stevens' declaration in his Bowers dissent, that \"the fact that the governing majority in a State has traditionally viewed a particular practice as immoral is not a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting the practice,\" ante, at 17. This effectively decrees the end of all morals legislation. If, as the Court asserts, the promotion of majoritarian sexual morality is not even a legitimate state interest, none of the above-mentioned laws can survive rational-basis review.\n\n \n \n It is Scalia that shares my view the best...\n \n Let me be clear that I have nothing against homosexuals, or any other group, promoting their agenda through normal democratic means. Social perceptions of sexual and other morality change over time, and every group has the right to persuade its fellow citizens that its view of such matters is the best. That homosexuals have achieved some success in that enterprise is attested to by the fact that Texas is one of the few remaining States that criminalize private, consensual homosexual acts. But persuading one's fellow citizens is one thing, and imposing one's views in absence of democratic majority will is something else. I would no more require a State to criminalize homosexual acts-or, for that matter, display any moral disapprobation of them-than I would forbid it to do so. What Texas has chosen to do is well within the range of traditional democratic action, and its hand should not be stayed through the invention of a brand-new \"constitutional right\" by a Court that is impatient of democratic change. It is indeed true that \"later generations can see that laws once thought necessary and proper in fact serve only to oppress,\" ante, at 18; and when that happens, later generations can repeal those laws. But it is the premise of our system that those judgments are to be made by the people, and not imposed by a governing caste that knows best.\n",

I agree with your statement here--people don't want it called marriage because it's not marriage. Marriage is an opposite-sex thing.\n\n \n First, I think it is about hating gay people, or at least disapproval of the lifestyle. No other motivation makes sense.\n \n Secondly, we can redefine marriage as a legal status as we wish. We've already done it more than once. There is no harm to heterosexuals should marriage be redefined to include homosexuals. Again, when we are talking about a group's constitutional rights, what some other group thinks about it isn't really relevant.\n \n \nBut it's your side who wants to enact the policy here, not the other side. Do you deny that you want the policy of marriage including gay people to be put in place?\n\n \n Yes, to correct what I (and many others) see as a violation of Equal Protection as well as the First Amendment.\n \n \nI don't think you understand the situation. For the most part, the ones wanting to enact something into law or redefine marriage are people who are FOR gay marriage, not those against. Why do you think the gay lobby is trying to get judges in so many states to reinterpret the law?

So outside of government why do you wish to get \"married\"? What benefits does it give?\n \n \n \n doG,\n The history of marriage is rather unknown. You give history about the Indians...and I don't doubt they had some form of marriage, however, I would say they had their own religion. The Romans did as well. Non the less, I was not saying marriage has always been religious but in recent tradition it has been...obviously that is changing now...might point to that is then, outside of government why marry?",

   ". Many cultures have had various forms of marriage even if never exposed to religion. Consider the mating rituals of the American Indian before any exposure to religion by settlers.\n\n \n I am unaware of any culture that did not have some form of religion. There were certainly societies wherein several religions coexisted, occasionally even without a built-in bias towards one of them, but \"never exposed to religion\"??? Which ones?\n \n \n2. While many cultures have had various bonding or mating rituals, marriage, irregardless of religion, they have always been man/woman. I can't imagine an Indian Chief joining two braves together as an indian couple.\n\n \n That's just not true. There have been many different forms of same-sex union in cultures. Of course, in the wide scope of human culture, actual marriage has been few and far between. BUT they have existed and have been, at times, equal to heterosexual marriage and, at other times, either inferior or superior to the opposite-sex relationships. \n \n When making comparisons to \"traditional\" marriage over the millennia of human culture, it is wise to keep in mind that heterosexual marriage was usually a very different thing from what marriage is today. Claiming to be part of that long tradition is something one should do with caution.\n \n \nTo me it seems that cultural or societal marriage is not limited to religious marriage. If I recall correctly the Roman Empire had the equivalent of marriage long before Jesus even. I am not aware though of any cultures in time though that joined two men or two women in the context of a civil union or marriage within their society. Perhaps Matthew could find some historical examples to support his definition, i.e.\n\n \n Virtually every society that has ever existed has had marriage, in a wide, wide variety of forms. Of course it didn't start with Jesus. Nor did it start with the Hebrews of bronze age Israel. More importantly, in THIS tradition that modern Western culture belongs to, marriage was CIVIL before it was religious. The Catholic Church discouraged marriage (theologically) for a few centuries until they warmed up to it in the 4th century. Before that, it was an entirely CIVIL ceremony conducted according to Roman Law in areas under Roman control. In areas outside Roman control, or areas where Roman control was somewhat tenuous, other non-Christian traditions covered marriage ceremonies. Some of those traditions had what we would see today as unions, usually not civil (because the civil was religious for these peoples) and usually not identical to marriage.\n \n When one looks back, of course ALL societies offered some form of family structures to accommodate heterosexual behavior. It is, afterall, the majority orientation and not accommodating it in some way is a recipe for the quick demise of a culture. Many societies also made allowances for non-heterosexual behavior. The extreme intolerance exhibited by Christianity in recent centuries is the anomaly. There's also quite a bit of evidence that the intolerance was not as consistent as we think nor as unbending.",

My point is this....why will some couples go to other states or Canada to get \"married\" when it does nothing with relation to the government acknowledging your marriage?\n\n \n I tend to view this whole issue only on its legal points. I don't need religious \"validation\" and I don't need \"celebration\" from my family and community. This colors my view.\n \n My partner and I considered what you're talking about. First of all, in the eyes of the government of Quebec and, therefore, Canada, we are ALREADY married, whether we want them to see us that way or not. Confirming it with a civil ceremony would, as far as we can tell, make no legal difference whatsoever. Also, it is not entirely clear that encouraging this view of our relationship is to our benefit as long as our status in the U.S. is unequal.\n \n I can, however, see why some couples would pursue a Canadian marriage. If the couple sees the possibility of emigration to Canada, it would make sense, I think (I'm not a lawyer, so I could well be wrong). For those who travel to Canada and face some sort of medical issue, I can imagine that it would also be prudent.\n \n In the case of Massachusetts, once the issue of Romney's shameful use of a segregationist law to prevent marriages between non-residents has been settled, I woud consider getting married there. I can imagine all sorts of scenarios in which I might want the option to move to Boston and be seen as married for legal purposes (even if the way they drive there terrifies me). I probably would go get married there if I could, because I'm pretty confident that that marriage would eventually be recognized where I do live and, in time, across the country. There are quite a few situations in which the length of time one has been married is relevant.",
