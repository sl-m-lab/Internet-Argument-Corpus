Now I'm on another state and every morning over the intercom the announcer says \"As we begin another day, let us pause for a moment of silence to reflect,meditate,pray, or engage in any other silent activities.\" Well, we recently had a mother come in and sue the schoolboard saying that the morning announcement promoted prayer, and she WON! Now we can't even mention the WORD prayer in school. Do you guys think that's right? What are your opinions on this?",
