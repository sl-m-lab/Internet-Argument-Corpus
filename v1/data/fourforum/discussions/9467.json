   "I am only 15, and I am currently going to a Catholic high school which unfortunately I hate because of the primitive ideal of a religion, the only reason I attend this particular religious school is because it had much higher standards than any of the public schools which unfortunately were quite distasteful, so for now I will have to bear with it. Now onto my point...\n \n Fortunately for me I have already been able to understand the motives for the development of religion. But what I can't seem to figure is why so many others can't understand the reason for these quite obviously false belief systems. \n \n 1.) Why can't many people understand that man created the idea of super-natural deities merely to explicate unexplained occurrences in nature or otherwise. \n \n 2.) Why can't people see that the idea of an afterlife was created buy humans to help compensate the fear of death and to understand it.\n \n These questions do have a perfectly logical approach to looking at religion but why can't religious people see this. They seem to always have the same response \"God created everything, Can't you see this\" which really isn't that logical taking into account science and the logical explanation for the creation of religion\n \n Here is an example to help support my belief of an explanation of false religious beliefs:\n \n Take into example that there are only two religions, religion A and religion B, both A and B have millions of followers but neither religion shares any similarity to the other and both religions contradict the others beliefs. Both the religions followers are devout and faithful to their religion. \n \n Now here's, the question. If both religions are sure that they are correct and the other one is wrong and both believe that their deity is the one true deity and both religions have identical arguments to defend their belief with no evidence to support their claims. How are the religious followers supposed to know which religion is correct? \n \n Unfortunately, for fear of being prosecuted in the afterlife no follower of their particular religious sect is willing to question their belief and therefore the religion continues onward being passed down through families never being examined using a logical approach. So we will have to answer the question ourselves.\n \n Does it not make sense to believe that both religions were merely created by humans and that there is no truth to religion. because we know that one of the religions A or B must be false this fact can not be defended. And know that we have realized this we can now argue that there is an incorrect one which was created falsely. But if one could be false than the other could be equally as false as the reasons for the creation of which ever one was 'false' would equally apply to the other religion. And since neither religion has any evidence of truth does it not make sense that both religions are false and they were both created by a false belief system because of both the will to have an explanation of the unknown causes of nature and the aftermath of death.\n \n Does this not make perfectly logical sense and why after reading it can religious people still continue to believe in their religions, especially when science can explain everything so logically.\n \n This whole thing is quite frustrating and I eagerly await the day that people finally realize this and can finally settle their religious differences.\n \n I just wanted to post this to see what others opinions on it were.",

   "I have one comment:\n \n2.) Why can't people see that the idea of an afterlife was created buy humans to help compensate the fear of death and to understand it.\n\n This is the important one. People don't care so much about explaining the universe as being reassured that they will stay alive after death in some way. Unlike other organisms, humans (and possibly some close relatives) are able to comprehend death, what it means, and how to avoid it. Unfortunately, this brings with it a fear of dying. This fear drives people to look for a \"solution.\" If no logical \"solution\" presents itself, people may turn to the illogical, not knowing any better.\n Certainly there is a biological drive to make religions, with 4200 religions existing worldwide. It should be noted that widespread religions generally support the idea of either an afterlife or reincarnation.",
