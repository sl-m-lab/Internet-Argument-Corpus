   "I went to buy some gospel music, so I thought, as I excitingly popped in the CD....The beats was so worldly I had to repent afterwards. \n \n It was bizarre, it was as if I flashback in time, while the Jesus words did ring... those hypnotic beats took my mind away.... back to the nightmarish clubs, the days of slut nasty gear, a fat joint, and a bunch of Vodkas straight. My hips begin to shake and roll like a snake..... \n My spirit confused, convicted, and dazed, eventually I came to myself and threw those CD's away",

   "Like playing \"Jesus Loves Me\" to that R. Kelly song \"Bump & Grind\" or \"Take The Name of Jesus With You\" to Marylin Mason tunes, like oil and water, gospel music and worldly beats just don't mix-\n \n \n \n The World and the Gospel does not mix-\n \n \n First and the Last time I'll buy something from The Trinity Station. I should have foreseen it however, exspecially, comming from a people who would turn the one true God into 3 ( heathens)",

   "Wait, could you clarify this? There are actually \"evil\" beats? Did the bible ever expand on their explanation of good and bad beats, or is this just something you say because they're innovative and unheard of?\n Basically, any untraditional or fast-moving beats are \"heathen\" and \"sacreligious\"? Sorry, but I'm not understanding the rationale behind this.\n In the bible does God banish certain genres of music from delivering and propogating his word? If not, why is this music sinful?",

However it was the way that it made me feel, while listening to those beats\n \n \n \n Once I went to a nightclub, who's band was blasting devil music all night long, then it suddenly switched to religious words but kept the beats the same, don't you know those people never missed a beat.... kept right on.. with the dirty dancing/romp shaking/ twisting like a snake/ with breast & buttocks swinging all over the place ...it was to much for me..( at that time in my life...that totally blew my high)",
