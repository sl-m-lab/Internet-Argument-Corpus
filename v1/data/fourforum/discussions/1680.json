   "Laser guns will never really catch on as a self-defense mechanisum because of the same reason the cannon never became the soldiers weapon of choice. The machinery required to fire a laser with enough power to stopped a ICMB fills an entire C-135 Hercules. So don't worry, we're years away from having Kirk in a shoot out with Bones. \n \n But..should the technology ever become small enough to be reasonably portable it would be the ultimate killing weapon. All you need to do is see your victum and shoot. 50 miles, 100 miles..dosen't matter, If you can see them, their dead. If would be silent, effecient, and the most freaky thing, with a fully silvered mirror you could shoot some guy in the oval office window while standing on the other side of the white house.\n \n Overall...No noise, infinite range, perfect damage, 100% kill ration, Semi-automatic and automatic at the same time, perfect accuracy...gee I don't know about you, but by god I AM GOING TO EAT RIGHT, RUN A MILE EVERYDAY AND WORK MY BUTT OFF just so I can shoot a laser-gun! \n \n HEHE that squiral never knew what hit him. \n \n P.S. the laser would be invisible so you wouldn't even know you were being shot at until you heard a strange sizzling sound coming from your freinds head!",

And the AK may be a bit much for home use, as the 7.62 would way over-penetrate the walls and hit the neighbors houses (or the neighbors.) Hope that helped.\n\n \n \n My first line of defense for up to 300 yards is an M4 (specops m16) flattop with an ACOG scope and tritium backup sights, 14.5 barrel with a 1/7 twist with mccluek (sp) muzzle brake to make it the legal 16 inches. foward pistol grip and a surefire light mounted to my knights RASII. I keep 45 grains in the clips so they frange and not penatrate walls. I keep a second clip with 77gr noslers in a mag-cinched clip for longer range shots. I use a long range Shephered scope on my .308 chambered m14 for shotting zombies out to 1000 yards. And to compliment my defensive ability I keep a romanian AK in my bugout bag with a surefire light and an OKO red dot scope for quick egress when reliability is of most importance and close range firefight is likley. (this in not to mention the plethora of pistoles and handguns I keep for home defense also). THe m4 is 1.5 MOA, The M14 (m1a) is sub MOA, and the AK is a typical 3-4moa. BTW. I have had military and civilian training in all of these weapons\n \n I also keep a well trained Caucasian Mountain dog roaming the house at night so if anyone where to make it inside I doubt there would be anything left of him by the time I got there...\n \n \n Preparedness my friends...\n \n \n \n Now VoR probably keeps his Rechargable phone next to his bed and a whistle around his wifes neck and a fancy pug roaming the house...\n \n \n \n Dear Mr. Criminal,\n \n \n Which house would you like to break into.\n \n \n SIncerely,\n \n 1 constitutional rights violator and 1 law abiding citizen.",

Let me take you for a ride on the logic bus... \n \n \n VoR, You, and the other would be civil rights violators are so certain in your views about guns but are hesitant to put a sign in your window claiming that your home is a \"Gun Free Home\". Yet you want to take away my personal property all in the guise of public saftey. My very simple point was that a criminal would be much happier breaking into your home than he would mine as he would most likley walk out of your house with a little loot to support his drug habit while in my castle he would be carried out in a body bag all seen on the 6 oclock news for your entertainment.... My question (a R h e t o r i c a l one) was an open question for would be criminals, asking Which house would you rather break into? \n \n \n Let me ask you this...
