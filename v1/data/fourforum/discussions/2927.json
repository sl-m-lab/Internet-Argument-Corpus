And Al Gore lost Tennessee, his home state. Did Bush steal Tennessee? Since you're in Australia and apparently aren't familiar with what has happened in the US, let me break it down for you:\n \n \n In 1997 during the Miami mayoral race, thousands of votes were cast by felons and some people who were apparently dead. The Miami Herald led an investigation ito this and discovered that over 100 convicted felons voted in mayoral election. They also found out that over 50,000 felons and 18,000 dead people were on the list of Florida's registered voters. So to get these people off the list of registeres voters, the state appropriated $4 million to fix the situation. And if you were wrongly removed from the list, you could appeal. So only convicted felons and dead people were removed. Then after the 2000 Presidential election, the Miami Herald did another investigation. They found out that in just 2 counties, at least 39 felons had cast illegal ballots, voting Democrat. \"According to these percentages at the polls, it could amount to over 470 illegal ballots locally and 2,000 statewide.\" So Bush did not steal any votes; if anyone did Gore did. \n \n \n \nPS, I don't think the Democrats are left-wing.\n Also, what is wrong with being a liberal?

My personal opinion is your hatred is retaliation for the Right's treatment of Clinton, so talk about third grade behavior!! OH YEAH? YOU TREAT OUR GUY LIKE THAT, WE'LL TREAT YOURS LIKE THAT! LMAO REAL mature. At least the Right had tangible evidence what a slimy XXXXX Clinton was, but I don't recall books being written about assassinating him. As much as I loathed the \"man\", I would not have found any joy in Clinton being assassinated; however, I think you all would jump with glee like those AYrabs on 9-11 if Bush was taken out.\n\n \n The first mistake you make is generalizing and trying to group all opposing viewpoints into a nice neat little catagory. What you and several others can't seem to comprehend is that the majority of Americans that take issue with this administration do so for their interpretation of what our foreign policy should be. It has nothing to do with being a Liberal or Conservative. Those political positions define domestic issues and were never mean't to include foreign policy. Being \"Conservative\" means exactly what it says: sticking to traditional values and spending money in a frugal way. I am an independent voter that is very conservative by nature and probably leans Republican more often than Democrat. I absolutely don't agree with the \"logic\" of what we've done in Iraq and for that reason I can't vote for this administration. I could care less about all the \"who's, where's and why's\" of what put us in this position, the fact is we're here and this administration put us here. If you think we're on the right track as a nation, by all means use your vote to acknowledge it, but that in itself doesn't make you a Conservative, it just makes you a Republican.",

I brought up Clinton because there was tangible evidence he was a liar, and with Bush there isn't-very simple\n\n \n Your barking up the wrong tree, you didn't vote for Clinton so it's immaterial if you were disappointed. You're a Republican, it's your job to criticize the Democrats. Everyone was disappointed in Clinton's affair/lie including Democrats. His lasting popularity is attributable to his performance as a President.\n \n \nYou'd love to think the Conservative platform has changed but it hasn't. We still want the traditional Conservative values. I've admitted that I'm not pleased with Bush and his spending. As I've said, he is too worried about pleasing his enemies and naively thinks he can get Democrats to vote Republican. \n\n \n I never said the Conservative platform changed. I said the current administration wasn't Conservative, there's a difference. You admit you're not happy with Bush's spending, that seems reasonable given you claim to be Conservative and I don't consider this President to be Conservative. All politicians pander to whoever will listen, in the end it's all about getting votes.\n \n \nThat R is the mark of the beast to Democrats-there is NOTHING on this planet one can do to get them to vote Republican. \n\n \n What a profound statement! I'm pretty sure it works the other way as well.\n \n \nI rest my case, continual lies from the Left! Get over it, Bush won fair and square. The lazy and gullible will hear your lies over and over and come to believe it as the truth. You people amaze me, you have the nerve to say we are putting the national debt off for our children to pay-how magnanimous of you. Yet, you people destroying the concept of truth will leave our children with nothing-without truth there IS nothing\n\n \n Relax, take a deep breath, that paragraph had more drama in it than a daytime soap opera, and just as genuine! emoticon_rolleyes",

They had over 6 months to appeal. This gave them ample time to send it back if there were any errors. They didn't send it out to everyone and ask them to prove they weren't felons.\n \n Was the CNN site truly a CNN site, or was it Jesse Jackson's site? The site says, \"Black voters in Florida and around the country turned out in record numbers on November 7. Since then, many have complained that Florida election officials removed large numbers of minorities from state voting rolls, wrongly classifying them as convicted felons -- and accused Florida officials of using police to intimidate voters in some areas.\" Those people complaining all received notices in the mail that said they were convicted felons or dead. Whites were effected as well. They had the chance to send the form back in explaining that they weren't in fact a felon. Over half of these appeals were changed. The ones that weren't changed were because they were in fact felons. They already had a mishap in the 1997 mayoral election, and to fix that they cleaned up the voting records. What did you want them to do, allow felons and dead people to vote? (www.newsherald.com/archive/local/1d081998.htm) (www.commondreams.org/headlines01/0527-03.htm) (www.kressworks.com/politics/election_2000/results/at_least_39_felons_cast_illegal_votes.htm)\n \n This is in response to Paul Krugman's, the biggest liberal in the media's, remarks. He said \"Florida law denies the vote to convicted felons. But in 2000 many innocent people, a great number of them black, couldn't vote because they were erroneously put on a list of felons; these wrongful exclusions may have put Governor Bush's brother in the White House.\" That is true. All the blacks had to do was simply fill out the appeal. Maybe they couldn't read. Whites were on the list as well, and they aren't bitching like the blacks are. \n \n \n The link to civilrights.org actually favors my argument. Those people that were convicted felons weren't allowed to vote. \"Convicted of a felony and briefly incarcerated in 1981...his vote was not counted in the 2000 election.\" What is your point by bringing up this site? Felons are not allowed to vote in Florida.\n \n \n It won't let me look at the last link. \n \n \n \n \n \nAnd let me say - you are the THE LAST person to whine about sources when you were unable to provide even ONE in our discussions about the Patriot Act. (Not to mention I don't recall you providing any in this debate either.)\n\n \n \n I actually gave you a source for the one in this debate. Go back and check it. It's there. \n \n \n \n \n \nI never claimed them to be more than stories! And why should I believe YOU? You never provide sources - just accuse everyone you disagree with of being a liar.\n \n \n \n \n I gave sources, and I am giving more sources here. Cry me a river!!\n \n \n \n \nI did. I think your wrong. And I don't care what the Dems or Reps think of that. Just what I think. Try it some time. It's quite empowering to use one's own brain.\n\n \n \n \n You can think all you want. Bush won Florida fair and square. Everyone in Florida had their votes counted at least 2 times. Here is something to look at, which shows how big of a panzy Gore is...\n \n \n \n In the 2000 election, Al Gore won New Mexico by 366 votes. Did Bush cry about it and demand recounts? No. But when Gore lost Florida by about 500 votes, Gore cried and bitched about how there needed to be recounts. By doing this, Gore became the 1st Presidential candidate to concede and election and then contest it. To try and win Florida, Gore tried to disenfranchise American servicemen overseas by going to court to disallow military absentee ballots. The Democrats even wrote a 5 page memo describing how to disqualify military ballots. Pretty pathetic. Gore also only asked for recounts in 3 heavily Democratic counties to be recounted. Why didn't he ask for a recall in all of the mostly Republican counties in the Panhandle? \n \n And look at this. Assume, by some chance, that a few thousand black Democrats didn't have their vote counted. With an hour remaining before the polls closed in the 10 mainly Republican counties in the Florida Panhandle, ABC, CNN, Fox News, CBS, MSNBC, and NBC all incorrectly declared Gore the winner. Since those in the Panhandle are a time zone different, they heard the news while there was still an hour left for them to vote. Why would they go vote if they already heard the results of the election stating Gore had won? John McLaughlin and Associates did a study to find out how many more votes Bush would have recieved had those voters not heard the false results. They found that it cost Bush over 10,000 votes. \n \n So even if you think a few thousand blacks didn't have their votes count, Gore still would have lost.\n \n (www.nationalreviewonline.com/comment/lott200312100915.asp)\n (Bill Sammon, At Any Cost.

   "What facts are you referring to? Do you actually think someone needs to be told their better off? If so, who should tell them, you?\n\n \n Well, let's just say that when the Left starts spewing out \"the worst economy in 50 years...blah blah blah\", yeah I'd have to say that those are bold faced lies, and your side happens to follow the belief that if you say it enough.... How about your side trying the truth for ONCE, JUST ONCE-give the people something to vote FOR instead of just AGAINST. Tell us the TRUTH about Kerry's record, the most LIBERAL voting record in the Senate, and forget about this Conservative mask the Left has to put on everytime there is a national election-the ONLY way to get elected is to appear Conservative, but they have to LIE all the time to get those votes. \n \n \nI'll be happy to talk jobs if you like. The employment report was just released a little over a week ago and we've created 32,000 jobs for that period. Experts had predicted over 200,000, needless to say everyone was disappointed. Your neighbor's employment is irrelevant, the government figures speak for themselves. We have fewer jobs today than we did 4 years ago, PERIOD.\n\n \n So, you're just gonna pick one period to illustrate the poor job growth? C'mon!!

   "Why do you dismiss that statement?\n\n \n I'm going to refrain from replying directly because your widening the scope of this debate to the point that it's just not practical to address all your statements. I've stated repeatedly that I vote independently, which means by definition that I will vote for candidates from either party that represent my values. I've also stated that while I don't think there's any such thing as a \"pure\" Liberal or Conservative, I relate more to the right than the left. Maybe that makes me a moderate Conservative. You just can't concede that anyone that dissagrees with this administration doesn't have to be a Liberal or Democrat. In addition, you keep interjecting statements about the economy and the President that I never made. I never said the economy was the worst in 50 years or that George Bush lied. I did point out the job numbers and quoted the last 4 years because they belong to the current administration. You misquoted my statement on the conservative platform, if you reread it you'll see that I said this administration strayed, not the conservative platform. If you really know the definition, you'd admit this administration doesn't fit it. Lastly, I never, ever, ever said anything about Kerry. You automatically assumed because I was unhappy with Bush that I was backing Kerry.

My post was explaining that the current Republican administration \"strayed\" from traditional Conservative values. That doesn't mean Conservative values or definitions have changed, it means that this administration isn't Conservative. I don't know how much clearer I can say it. Traditionally, Republicans have stood for smaller government and less spending. Are you prepared to argue (debate) that this administration has followed that rule? That's my point, nothing more or less. You don't need a valid reason to vote for this administration, it's your right. Just don't kid yourself into thinking you're voting for a Conservative.

   "So you get the best information, and FOX and other news stations don't use that? Come on, if you can find something on the Internet, so can FOX. The news has access to everything you can get and more. Most news do have a bias, and I am not saying FOX doesn't, but just because you get your information from the Internet doesn't mean it's not biased.\n\n \n Of course it is not always unbiased (I don't even know of most of the time) but usually I can see the source of their data, and I can usually see both points of view of the same information. That allows me to decide for myself what I believe.\n \n And of course every news outlet can get the information, but they don't run it. Online, I can find sources about Bush paying for his girlfriend's abortion back when abortions were illegal. They know she had one (medical records and affidavits from friends) but she will not come forward so they cannot break the story so no news channels cover it. Plus news shows are all about sensationalism and ratings, and frankly I don't trust them much, especially Fox with their open bias against Democrats. I don't trust them to provide all the facts.\n \n \n \n\n But how come when a group of 200+ soldiers who were in Vietnam and saw Kerry and how he acted come out and express their accounts of what happened, they are called liars by the Kerry wing and everyone says that if you don't denounce this dishonest ad, then you're just as bad as them?

That's pretty sad if you ask me, don't you think? If Kerry's advisors can use cheap shots and call Bush a liar and Cheney a coward, don't you think the vets should be allowed to speak their mind without being harassed and threatened?\n\n \n Why in the world are you bringing up what Kerry is doing? I don't care what Kerry is doing, we're talking the vets accusations. Whenever debates happen it seems that Bush supporters have to point and say \"well, he's bad too!\". \n \n I have no problem with anyone speaking their mind and providing evidence.

The economy speaks for itself, the last job report came out yesterday and dissapointed predictions. In addition, 37,000 jobs created were in the government sector, so much for small government.

   "The trouble with this type of quiz is that they seem to be skewed towards the opinions of those who come up with them. I took the test fully expecting to be a neocon, answered all the questions truthfully (almost hurt my finger in clicking abolish the EPA :p ) and it showed me only as a #1 - a plain conservative. I was really surprised. Don't mind being called a neocon though. I think I'd be in what I consider good company. :)\n\n \n Actually, I thought #1 did indicate neocon. I took the test also and came up with a #1 but don't agree with the neocon philosophy pertaining to foreign policy. I think you can be pro-active, anti-terrorism, and watch out for the security of the American public without becoming an island, alienated from the rest of the world. When it comes to domestic politics, I'm as Conservative as you can be when it comes to the government spending our money. I'm also for small government and believe the private sector can do most things better and cheaper. Like most of those questionnaires, there are questions that don't have a black and white answer so you get erroneously pigeon-holed into a category that isn't quite right.",
