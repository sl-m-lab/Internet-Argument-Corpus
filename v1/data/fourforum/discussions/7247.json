The reins of national leadership were handed over to Deputy Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.\n\n \n The Israelis call him \"The Bulldozer\" the Palestenians call him \"The Butcher\". Whatever you want to call him, hopefully this particular war criminal, the guy who personally ordered and participated in the slaghter of thousands of Palestenain women and children, will die soon and there will actually be a chance for peace in Israel.\n \n Regardless of who replaces him, it will almost certainly be better. If he is replaced by a hardliner, they will crack down on the palestenians, and the palestenians will recieve increased international support. OR, somebody more reasonable will be elected and the Palestnians will immediatly be better off.\n \n Regardless, it is unlikely they will find somebody else who can pull off the delicate balancing act that Sharon has....killing enough palestenians to ensure that there will be continued attacks while taking nonsensical non steps towards peace on a frequent enough basis that the international community does not throw more support behind the palestenians.",

So many people have died, so many people have had injustices inflicted upon them, and the wounds are still fresh, that revenge upon revenge is inevitable.\n It's just a shame that we didn't get to see Sharon indicted for crimes against humanity, shamed and sentenced in front of the whole world, before he began his descent towards probable death.",

Sharon did not start his present games becuase he wanted to. He started them because the rest fo the world was fed up with watching israle butcher palestenians. The Russians announced that they would openly support the palestenians in the struggle as did much of Europe. Sharon Started pretending to give a rats XXX about peace, and it gave the US leverage to get other countries to back off.\n \n I say we roll back to full scale war between the israelis and the palestenians. The US does not have the political capital to stop the rest fo the world from stepping in and stomping on israel. Let it happen.\n \n I do wish there had been an opportunity to see Sharon tried and hanged, and maybe buried next tot he nazis that he bears so much in common with.",
