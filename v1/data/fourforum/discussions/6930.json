Within Islam, TODAY, based on Muhammed's example of his child-bride, Moslem men are still permitted to have sex with girls.\n \n The way most non-Moselm apologists try to get around this is to state that it was an example only for that time, and try a relativist approach (attempts at finding parallels of Christian men who did the same thing), ignoring as they do that these men are not the 'ideal' in Christianity.\n \n The way most Mostlem apologists try to get around this is by stating a legal fiction; that they only allow marriages with 'women'. This is as far as I'm concerned a legal fiction because they simply declare the girl-child to be legally a woman, and therefore capable of consenting in an adult fashion (however her silence is also deemed to be 'consent').\n \n Here's some more advice for the contemplating Moslem of today ;)\n \"The fact that it is permissible to marry a minor girl does not imply that it is permissible to have intercourse with her, rather the husband should not have intercourse with her until she becomes able for that. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) delayed consummating the marriage to &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her). \"\n http://63.175.194.25/index.php?ln=eng&ds=qa&lv=browse&QR=12708&dgn=4\n A minor can be found guilty of adultery!\n \"Q: What is the punishment for a girl found guilty of adultery if she has not even reached her puberty that is she is still a minor ?.\n \"A: But the minor boy or girl should be punished, with something less than the hadd punishment, in a manner that will deter them from doing this action. And their guardian must also be punished if there was any shortcoming on his part, such as allowing his daughter to mix with boys or being careless concerning such matters. \"\n http://63.175.194.25/index.php?ln=eng&ds=qa&lv=browse&QR=8981&dgn=4\n \n And when she's nine, she's deemed 'capable' of sex...\n \"The fact that it is permissible to marry a young girl does not mean that it is permissible to have intercourse with her; rather that should not be done until she is able for it. For that reason the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) delayed the consummation of his marriage to &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah. Al-Nawawi said: With regard to the wedding-party of a young married girl at the time of consummating the marriage, if the husband and the guardian of the girl agree upon something that will not cause harm to the young girl, then that may be done. If they disagree, then Ahmad and Abu &#8216;Ubayd say that one a girl reaches the age of nine then the marriage may be consummated even without her consent, but that does not apply in the case of who is younger. Maalik, al-Shaafa&#8217;i and Abu Haneefah said: the marriage may be consummated when the girl is able for intercourse, which varies from one girl to another, so no age limit can be set. This is the correct view. There is nothing in the hadeeth of &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah to set an age limit, or to forbid that in the case of a girl who is able for it before the age of nine, or to allow it in the case of a girl who is not able for it and has reached the age of nine.

   "http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/27/international/africa/27malawi.html\n \n November 27, 2005\n Forced to Marry Before Puberty, African Girls Pay Lasting Price \n By SHARON LaFRANIERE\n CHIKUTU, Malawi - Mapendo Simbeye's problems began early last year when the barren hills along Malawi's northern border with Tanzania rejected his attempts to grow even cassava, the hardiest crop of all. So to feed his wife and five children, he said, he went to his neighbor, Anderson Kalabo, and asked for a loan. Mr. Kalabo gave him 2,000 kwacha, about $16. The family was fed.\n \n But that created another problem: how could Mr. Simbeye, a penniless farmer, repay Mr. Kalabo?\n \n The answer would shock most outsiders, but in sub-Saharan Africa's rural patriarchies, it is deeply ingrained custom. Mr. Simbeye sent his 11-year-old daughter, Mwaka, a shy first grader, down one mangy hillside and up the next to Mr. Kalabo's hut. There she became a servant to his first wife, and, she said, Mr. Kalabo's new bed partner. \n \n Now 12, Mwaka said her parents never told her she was meant to be the second wife of a man roughly three decades her senior. \"They said I had to chase birds from the rice garden,\" she said, studying the ground outside her mud-brick house. \"I didn't know anything about marriage.\"\n \n Mwaka ran away, and her parents took her back after six months. But a week's journey through Malawi's dry and mountainous north suggests that her escape is the exception. In remote lands like this, where boys are valued far more than girls, older men prize young wives, fathers covet dowries and mothers are powerless to intervene, many African girls like Mwaka must leap straight from childhood to marriage at a word from their fathers.\n \n \n Sometimes that word comes years before they reach puberty.\n \n The consequences of these forced marriages are staggering: adolescence and schooling cut short; early pregnancies and hazardous births; adulthood often condemned to subservience. The list has grown to include exposure to H.I.V. at an age when girls do not grasp the risks of AIDS.\n \n Increasingly educators, health officials and even legislators discourage or even forbid these marriages. In Ethiopia, for example, where studies show that in a third of the states girls marry under the age of 15, one state took action in April. Officials said they had annulled as underage the marriages of 56 girls ages 12 to 15, and filed charges against parents of half the girls for forcing them into the unions. \n \n Yet child marriages remain entrenched in rural pockets throughout sub-Saharan Africa, from Ghana to Kenya to Zambia, according to Unicef. Studies show that the average age of marriage in this region remains among the world's lowest, and the percentage of adolescent mothers the world's highest.\n \n Many rural African communities, steeped in centuries of belief that girls occupy society's lower rungs, are inured to disapproval by the outside world. \n \n \"There is a lot of talk, but the value of the girl child is still low,\" said Seodi White, Malawi's coordinator for the Women in Law in Southern Africa Research Trust. \"Society still clings to the education of the boy, and sees the girl as a trading tool. In the north, girls as early as 10 are being traded off for the family to gain. After that, the women become owned and powerless in their husbands' villages.\"\n \n In villages throughout northern Malawi, girls are often married at or before puberty to whomever their fathers choose, sometimes to husbands as much as half a century older. Many of those same girls later choose lifelong misery over divorce because custom decrees that children in patriarchal tribes belong to the father.\n \n In interviews, fathers and daughters here unapologetically explained the rationales for forced, intergenerational unions.\n \n Uness Nyambi, of the village of Wiliro, said she was betrothed as a child so her parents could finance her brother's choice of a bride. Now about 17, she has two children, the oldest nearly 5, and a husband who guesses he is 70. \"Just because of these two children, I can not leave him,\" she said.\n \n Beatrice Kitamula, 19, was forced to marry her wealthy neighbor, now 63, five years ago because her father owed another man a cow. \"I was the sacrifice,\" Ms. Kitamula said, holding back tears. She likened her husband's comfortable compound of red brick houses in Ngana village to a penitentiary. \"When you are in prison,\" she said, \"you have no rights.\"\n \n (More to come)",

   "In tiny Sele, Lyson Morenga, a widower, financed his re-marriage two years ago by giving his daughter Rachel, then 12, to a 50-year-old acquaintance in exchange for a black bull, according to his new in-laws. Mr. Morenga delivered the bull to his new wife's family as a partial payment, said his wife's uncle, Stewart Simkonda. Mr. SImkonda said Mr. Morenga had promised to deliver a larger payment after the impending marriage of Rachel's younger sister.\n \n Malawi government officials say they try hard to protect girls like Rachel. Legislation before Parliament would raise the minimum age for marriage to 18, the legal age in most countries. Currently, marriages of Malawian girls from 15 to 18 are legal with the parents' consent. Women's rights advocates say they welcome the proposal, even though its effect would be limited because many marriages here, like much of the sub-Saharan region, take place under traditional customs, not civil law.\n \n The government trained about 230 volunteers last year in ways to protect children, especially girls. Volunteers for Malawi's Human Rights Commission, Roman Catholic Church workers and police victim-protection units also try to intervene. In Iponga village, for example, Mbohesha Mbisa averted a forced marriage to her uncle at age 13 last year by walking a half-mile to the local police station, where officers persuaded her father to drop his plans to use her to replace her deceased aunt as a wife and mother.\n \n \"I was really scared, but I wanted to protect myself,\" said Mbohesha, now in the sixth grade.\n \n Still, Malawi officials say that this region's growing poverty, worsened by AIDS and recent crop-killing drought, has put even more young girls at risk of forced marriage.\n \n \"This practice has been there for a long time, but it is getting worse now because there is desperation,\" said Penston Kilembe, Malawi's director of social welfare services. \"It is particularly prevalent in communities that have been hard hit by famine. Households that can no longer fend for themselves opt to sell off their children to wealthier households.\"\n \n \"The gains which were made in addressing early marriages are being lost,\" said Andrina Mchiela, principal secretary for the Ministry of Gender.\n \n Women's rights advocates want to abolish marriage payments, or lobolo, saying they create a financial incentive for parents to marry off their daughters. But even the advocates describe the tradition as politically untouchable.\n \n In its most benign form, lobolo is a token of appreciation from the groom's family to the bride's. At its most egregious, it turns girls into the human equivalent of cattle. In much of northern Malawi, lobolo negotiations are typically all-male discussions of down payments, installments, settlements and the occasional refund for a wife who runs off.\n \n Jimmy Mwanyongo, a 45-year-old village headman in Karonga, explained the marriage of his daughter Edah much as he might any commercial transaction. Several years ago, he said, sitting on a straw mat in his six-room house, he promised to care for his neighbor's two cows.\n \n Instead, he sold the cows to educate his adopted son. When the neighbor, Ridein Simfukwe, lost his wife a year later in 2002, Mr. Mwanyongo said he felt obliged to offer his daughter as a replacement. \"Because I had sold the two cows, I had no choice,\" he said.\n \n Edah was 17, doe-eyed and voluptuous. Even with an illegitimate son, her neighbors and relatives say, she had her pick of suitors. Mr. Simfukwe was 63, with nine grown children and a flock of grandchildren.\n \n Mr. Simfukwe said he considered Edah a bit young for him. But \"her father decided that although I am old, I am the right person.\"\n \n \"I think it was a tribute to my character,\" he said. \"Edah was willing. I didn't tie ropes around her neck and drag her.\"\n \n Edah said her father did everything but that. For nine months, she said, she held out until \"I thought I would die of sorrow.\"\n \n \"My father refused to allow me to eat,\" she said. \"He chased me from the house. He said, 'Go find somewhere where you can sleep!' He said, 'Go to your husband! If you don't want to go there, I will whip you to death!' \"\n \n Her mother, Tabu Harawa, sided with her daughter, to no avail. \"I told him, 'It is like you are killing her,' \" she said. \"It was shameful.\"\n \n She said, \"If it happens again, I will divorce him.\"\n \n Now 20, Edah has an 11-month-old girl and is racked by fears for her future. \"My husband is old,\" she said, sitting on the porch of her tiny thatched hut. \"He may die soon. Most likely he leave me with more children. So where will I go?\"\n \n Her life, she suggested, is about as free as that of the two prized oxen her father now hooks up to his wooden cart for springtime plowing. \"I am like a slave,\" she said.\n \n Some of Edah's neighbors pity her. Others joke that she has married her own grandfather. Their reaction is one hint that even the most traditional Africans are starting to frown on marriages of young women to old men, as Edah's mother said, \"for the sake of cows.\"\n \n Mwaka Simbeye has her fellow villagers in Chikutu to thank for her return to her parents' home after her sojourn in her neighbor's hut. Now back in the second grade, she is still young enough to be charmed by a simple game of toss. Her body remains that of a child's.\n \n At Mr. Kalabo's, she said in a barely audible whisper, \"I had to do all the household chores. Washing the plates, cleaning the house, fetching water, collecting firewood, cooking when the first wife wasn't around.\"\n \n Her father, Mapendo Simbeye, who repaid his $16 debt with Mwaka, said he took her back after hearing that the police could arrest him. In a clearing that serves as the village social center, he said he underestimated her, adding, \"My daughter is worth more than 2,000 kwacha.\" \n \n \"I did it out of ignorance,\" he said. \"I had five kids, no money and no food. Then Mr. Kalabo wanted the money back so I thought of selling the daughter. I didn't know I was abusing her.\"\n \n Mwaka's mother, Tighezge Simkonda, looks like an older version of her daughter and is no less shy. \"I did object,\" she said softly, glancing nervously at her husband chatting nearby. \"I said, 'My daughter is very young.' \"\n \n \"But the control is with the man,\" she said. \"The daughters belong to the man.\"",

Freya had many other lovers, although she deeply loved her consort Odin.

Aphrodite's amorous escapades pale by comparison with those of Freya, whose unbridled sexuality was legendary. \n \n Usually depicted as a strawberry blonde with stunning blue eyes, none could resist her. To make matters even worse, like the Greek goddess Aphrodite, she possessed apparel that made her irresistible to men. . . a magical necklace reputedly made of amber and rubies that was called a \"brisling\" or \"brisingamen\". . . .Freya had left it a bit late to leave her friend's house to start home. The sun set, and it began to snow. Soon she was becoming disoriented and frost-bitten. Luckily she was found by four dwarves who rescued her and took her to their home. The dwarves were named \"North, South, East, and West\".\n \n Freya volunteered to pay them for their hospitality and the four dwarves cheerfully agreed, saying that they would like to be repaid by having her sleep with each of them for one night.

I`m not so sure about that. Vanir (Vaner) and Aesir (Asar) seem to have been contemporary in scandinavia, at least during the Viking era. And while there are theories regarding the mythical war between Vanir and Aesir representing a religous shift caused by invading Goths, this should not be accepted as the undisputed. Granted, there are some circumstantial evidence regarding the word \"Van\" meaning \"old\" as well as certain indications of significant migrant waves in ancient history. But neither of these are conclusive in any way. Critics mean that these kind of stories of war between gods can commonly be found in various indo-european mythologies. Therefor it is often believed that the Aesir and Vaner where part of the same mythology without having been \"brought together\" through external influence, even though their importance and the importance of the individual god waxed and waned depending on the times, situation and what region you choose to look at. All we can be certain of is that we know very, very little of the ancient history of scandinavia and how their societies and religions worked. Heck, we don`t even know that much of the viking era and the best source for the Aesir mythology of the vikings we have is the writings of Snorre Sturlasson.

Oh, and apparently that insofar as there is a commonly worshipped 'chief God' early on, it's Thor.\n\n \n Hmm.. the chief god has always been Odin (Oden). Thor (Tor) was perhaps the most popular one among the warrior elite. But during certain periods, Frey (Fr\u00f6) worship was perhaps the most common due to his intimite relationship with harvests. \n \n As for runestones and pantheons; perhaps you are refering to pantheons as in \"temples\"? In that case I must appologize for having used the term wrongly and carelessly. As far as I know, there have only been one such temple, near Uppsala and that one is pretty controversial and mostly based on the testimony of a german clergy-man \n \n If you are refering to pantheons as in gods for seperate groups of people, I think there are quite a few runestones that identify individual gods. One such stone near Altuna church in Upland tells the story about Thor and how he almost managed to capture the Middle-earth snake (Midg\u00e5rdsormen).\n \n \nI have little personal knowledge on this, but am assured of it by very scholarly individuals.

   "I doubt that this is the meaning, and it seems from the commentaries that this is not the understood meaning. \n\n Given that they say that she can have sex when she is 'capable' of, then that determination rather depends on the husband. But I'm still amazed you don't see this as a problem.\n \nI mean, if you're going to draw a line as 'capable', there's only one real meaning that can have. Why say 'you can't have sex with your wife if it's physically impossible?\n\n Why say you can have sex with a child the moment she's 'capable'?\n \nI'm saying that a more natural interpretation is that childhood is defined as a stage of maturity, not arbitary age. Your list of what Muslims do is unimportant: we're talking about Islam and the Qu'ran. \n\n Funny! So, me citing how Moslems interpret their texts has nothing to do with the Koran????\n \nPeople of all religions do stupid things.\n\n Irrelevant.\n \nYou have made statements about Islam and the Qu'ran based on one site.\n\n That's not true. Post #1 has several. Compare this to your lack of quotes; you continue to use supposition in order to trivialise what is actually an horrendous abuse towards children.\n \nThe 'facts' are not about what you're making a claim about. I might as well say 'Jesus believed in slaughtering Arabs: just look at the Crusades!\n\n You could say that. However it would be a far different prospect to what I have done... which is to construct an argument.\n I'll walk you through the steps.\n Citing texts from Islam (done)\n Stating how these are 'ideal' (done)\n Citing interpretations of Moslems themselves, to show how they understand the texts (done)\n The best you have done is to cite a non-Buddhist site and then given me your opinion on how Buddhists have interpreted these facts; in other words, you make the very argument you (wrongly) believe I make.\n [QUOTE=Obvious Child]\n As for the Buddha: it's his basic life story. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha\n As noted, I didn't deny that he has done any such thing, I asked you to show that if he had, how this is seen as an example for Buddhist behaviour.\n \nThe Mahayana (great vehicle) Buddhists, who make up a majority of Buddhists, believe that Buddha was already an enlightened being when he was born. Therefore he would not make ethical mistakes\n\n See above\n \nI believe that the most sensible definition of 'capable', on common sense grounds as well as the quotes you give, is based on maturity. And you have not justifed the accusation of rape.\n\n So you support children having sex the moment they are physically 'capable'; wherein is the link between a physical capacity and a mental/emotional maturity?\n Rape is considered to be an unlawful act of violence against a person involving some form of sex. It is deemed unlawful because the person has not given consent. The law considers that a person is capable of giving consent, and thus even if a 'child' consents the law states that this consent is not meaningful, in the sense that it's as informed as an adult's consent.\n There is, as far as I'm aware no link, no scientific evidence to show that the moment a person is capable physically of having sex, that they are also emotionally and mentally capable of making such a decision.\n I await your evidence that this is the case, given that you seem to suggest that there's nothing wrong with being 'physically capable'.\n \n It always amazes me that there are people out there prepared to argue for such an evil.",

   "Bradamante:\n \n I have read your posts in this thread and have to say that to judge the marital practices of a 7th Century tribal community by 21st Century western industrialized social standards isn't really Cricket. In the Semitic world at the time of Mohammad a woman was considered sexually mature when she had her first period. In fact, in some third world countries today that is still the criteria. \n \n As you show, The Hadith Sahih al-Bukhari notes that Mohammad was married to Aisha three years prior to consummation. Many Muslim scholars state that Mohammad waited - as was proper at the time - until she reached puberty(after her first menstrual cycle) and was capable of bearing children.\n \n Iqbal Sacranie, in his article entitled We need protection from the peddlers of religious hatred in London's Daily Telegraph writes, \"Why would the Prophet have waited three years after his betrothal to Aisha - his only virgin bride - if not because he was waiting for her to attain puberty?\"\n \n Reaching puberty at 9 years old is not uncommon and waiting until a girl reached puberty before consummation a sexual relationship was considered the moral thing to do in the Semitic cultures of the time.\n \n Jim West, ThD, and Baptist minister, in his book Ancient Israelite Marriage Customs, says that the \"In Semitic cultures at the time, including the Hebrew, a wife was to be taken from within the larger family circle (usually at the outset of pubertyor around the age of 13) in order to maintain the purity of the family line;\"\n \n While discussing the meaning of the word 'almah, which is the Hebrew word for \"young woman\" or \"adolescent female\" in his book The Jew and the Christian Missionary, Gerald Segal says, \"It should be noted, however, that in biblical times females married at an early age\".\n \n Sue Curewitz Arthen writes in her book, Rites of Passage, \"Almost all primitive cultures pay attention to puberty and marriage rituals, although there is a general tendency to pay more attention to the puberty rites of males than of females. Because puberty and marriage symbolize the fact that children are acquiring adult roles, most primitive cultures consider the rituals surrounding these events very important. Puberty rituals are often accompanied with ceremonial circumcision or some other operation on the male genitals. Female circumcision is less common, although it occurs in several cultures. Female puberty rites are more often related to the commencement of the menstrual cycle in young girls.\" Some female authors agree: \"Puberty is defined as the age or period at which a person is first capable of sexual reproduction, in other eras of history, a rite or celebration of this landmark event was a part of the culture.\" \n \n There are studies that young girls who live in warmer climates reach puberty at an earlier age than those who live in colder climates. It is also clear that in western industrialized countries (US and Europe), different than in third world countries, it is not accepted that a woman is an adult just because she has her first period. \n \n I hope this goes a ways to rebutting your implication that Mohammad's sexual relationship with Aishah was an immoral act in the Semitic moral, social and cultural milieu of the 7th Century. \n \n As to the other issue, that the practice continues, can you document that in western industrialized countries \"Moslems continue with this practice...\" as you claim in your post? I am particularly interested in how prevalent it is. For it to be an acceptable and continuing institutionalized Islamic practice, I would think that it has to be more prevalent than the odd anecdotal case you cite. To make it easier, there are almost 3 million Muslims in the United States. How many incidents of the practice can you confirm in US in the past 10 years?\n \n Finally, you note that \"He [Mohammad] 'consummated' the marriage with Aisha; one that was initially arranged over the objections of her father...\" Having read the Hadiths, you know that they contradict this assertion. Can you please cite your source?\n \n All the best.",

Even if it were a mere 'political' alliance, there was no need to cosummate the marriage.\n \n Aisha herself was not aware of the marriage arrangements...\n Sahih Bukhari Volume 7, Book 62, Number 90 \n Narrated Aisha:\n When the Prophet married me, my mother came to me and made me enter the house (of the Prophet) and NOTHING SURPRISED ME BUT THE COMING OF ALLAH'S APOSTLE TO ME IN THE FORENOON. \n \n It was boasted that Muhammed had great sexual stamina...\n \n \"The Prophet used to visit all his wives in a round, during the day and night and they were eleven in number.\" I asked Anas, \"Had the Prophet the strength for it?\" Anas replied, \"We used to say that the Prophet was given the strength of thirty (men).\" And Sa'id said on the authority of Qatada that Anas had told him about nine wives only (not eleven).\" [Volume 1, Book 5, Number 268]\n \n And he was also one to admonish women for not submitting to a man's desires...\n \n \"The prophet of Allah said: When a man calls his wife to satisfy his desire, let her come to him though she is occupied at the oven.\"\n Mishkat al-Masabih, English translation, Book I, Section 'Duties of husband and wife', Hadith No. 61\n \n \"The prophet said: 'When a man calls his wife to bed and she does not come, the husband spends the night being angry with her, and the angels curse her until morning. The one who is in heaven is displeased with her until the husband is pleased with her.'\"(Sahih hadith, chapter 558) \n \n \n \n Muhammed hit Aisha\n \n Muhammad b. Qais said (to the people): Should I not narrate to you (a hadith of the Holy Prophet) on my authority and on the authority of my mother? We thought that he meant the mother who had given him birth. He (Muhammad b. Qais) then reported that it was 'A'isha who had narrated this: Should I not narrate to you about myself and about the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)? We said: Yes. She said: When it was my turn for Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) to spend the night with me, he turned his side, put on his mantle and took off his shoes and placed them near his feet, and spread the corner of his shawl on his bed and then lay down till he thought that I had gone to sleep. He took hold of his mantle slowly and put on the shoes slowly, and opened the door and went out and then closed it lightly. I covered my head, put on my veil and tightened my waist wrapper, and then went out following his steps till he reached Baqi'. He stood there and he stood for a long time. He then lifted his hands three times, and then returned and I also returned. He hastened his steps and I also hastened my steps. He ran and I too ran. He came (to the house) and I also came (to the house). I, however, preceded him and I entered (the house), and as I lay down in the bed, he (the Holy Prophet) entered the (house), and said: Why is it, O 'A'isha, that you are out of breath? I said: There is nothing. He said: Tell me or the Subtle and the Aware would inform me. I said: Messenger of Allah, may my father and mother be ransom for you, and then I told him (the whole story). He said: Was it the darkness (of your shadow) that I saw in front of me? I said: Yes. He struck me on the chest which caused me pain, and then said: Did you think that Allah and His Apostle would deal unjustly with you? &#8230; (Sahih Muslim, Book 004, Number 2127)",

   "Given that they say that she can have sex when she is 'capable' of, then that determination rather depends on the husband. But I'm still amazed you don't see this as a problem.\n \n Why say you can have sex with a child the moment she's 'capable'?\nIf you believe that there is a better measure than physical maturity, her decision and her parents', then fine. I would probably agree. Just don't cry 'child rape'.\n \n \nFunny! So, me citing how Moslems interpret their texts has nothing to do with the Koran????\nIt proves nothing about the Koran, only about those Muslims.\n \n \nIrrelevant.\nNot if you take the actions and views of people of one religion to be representative\n \n \nThat's not true. Post #1 has several. Compare this to your lack of quotes; you continue to use supposition in order to trivialise what is actually an horrendous abuse towards children.\nYou are arguing that the Koran states certain things: all I can do is demand evidence: otherwise I would have to post the entire Koran to show it isn't there.\n And I'm not trivialisng any abuse that does happen, I'm rejecting your inflammatory attacks on the Koran.\n \n \nYou could say that. However it would be a far different prospect to what I have done... which is to construct an argument.\n I'll walk you through the steps.\n Citing texts from Islam (done)\n Stating how these are 'ideal' (done)\n Citing interpretations of Moslems themselves, to show how they understand the texts (done)\nAnd thus the total proof is limited by the last stage: it is those peoples' views. You made statements about Islam and the Quran. I have posted links to Christians with similarly hatefilled views, which they back up with a plethora of Bible quotes, which are the 'ideal' word of God for them. Doesn't mean they're right.\n \nThe best you have done is to cite a non-Buddhist site and then given me your opinion on how Buddhists have interpreted these facts; in other words, you make the very argument you (wrongly) believe I make.\n As noted, I didn't deny that he has done any such thing, I asked you to show that if he had, how this is seen as an example for Buddhist behaviour.\n \n See above\nI don't see some devotional site as particularly reliable. Read any book on Mahayana Buddhism and you will see that asking whether the Buddha's actions are ideal is like asking if Christ's are.\n I have accepted that Muhammed's life is considered ideal, because I know that this is generally accepted in the tradition. The idea is far more clear within Buddhism.\n \n \nSo you support children having sex the moment they are physically 'capable'; wherein is the link between a physical capacity and a mental/emotional maturity?\n Rape is considered to be an unlawful act of violence against a person involving some form of sex. It is deemed unlawful because the person has not given consent. The law considers that a person is capable of giving consent, and thus even if a 'child' consents the law states that this consent is not meaningful, in the sense that it's as informed as an adult's consent.\n There is, as far as I'm aware no link, no scientific evidence to show that the moment a person is capable physically of having sex, that they are also emotionally and mentally capable of making such a decision.\n I await your evidence that this is the case, given that you seem to suggest that there's nothing wrong with being 'physically capable'.\n \n It always amazes me that there are people out there prepared to argue for such an evil.\nI'm arguing that you cannot label it as rape, not that I approve. In fact, as the woman has a choice, it is statutory at worst, which is dubious as a crime.\n \n Inability to give consent is defined in most countries by age. This is not a good guide to emotional and mental maturity. Also, it changes from country to country, and I believe state to state in America. A woman a man has married in one country can be considered to be a rape victim if he sleeps with her in another.\n \n As you say, it's 'unlawful', and therefore within Muslim countries what they do isn't rape. I'd like to hear your absolute standard of how we define emotional and mental maturity: I know 13 year olds more emotionally and mentally mature than some adults.",

   "Bradamante:\n \n I good a good chuckle from the dancing you did in your last post. I asked you to support your claim that \"Moslems continue with this practice...\" by offering some concrete evidence of when and where this has happened -- like an example of this in the US or Europe that was approved by the majority of Muslims or some established Muslim scholars. You cannot, but in a fancy two-step, you claim that you did! You then refer me back to an advice column and say that it is your \"evidence. I love it! Cite the \"advice\" of an advice column and then claim that the advice in that website not only represents Islam and the beliefs of all Muslims, but meets the requirements of evidence. By that standard, one would be correct to quote Pat Robertson and say that Christianity and all Christians support assassinating government leaders they don't agree with. Or even better, cite Ann Landers or Dear Abbey as representing Christian theology - the writers of both those columns are Christians.\n \n Try citing some concrete evidence that what you claim has actually happened in a wesstern industrial Muslim community instead of smearing an enitire people with anecdotal website advice columns.\n \n As for the rest of your post I enjoyed the verbal high-wire act of dodging and evading, but most of all I loved the brilliant gymnastic spin of agreeing that it is not appropriate to judge 7th Century humanity using the standards of 21st Century western industrialized society and then, in a dazzling display of disingenuousness doing exactly that.",

Some attack Islam's prophet (Mohammad) by using the moral and ethical standards of 21st Century western industrialized nations to judge the actions of a 7th Century Semitic tribal leader. They do not note that the fathers of our own country, a little over 225 years ago owned slaves, wrote into law that some human beings were only three fifths of human being because of the color of their skin. They allowed human beings to be owned by other human beings like property and allowed human beings to be tortured, abused and even killed by others whom the Founding Fathers agreed were their owners -- without consequences. Does that render everything that our Founding Father did evil? Does that mean that all Americans are tainted by the wrongs of men and women who lived 2 centuries ago? I think they would say, \"Of course not.\" And what is really more pertinent, the cover-up of rampant child abuse in its priesthood by the Catholic Church recently, or the actions of a man thirteen thousand years ago? If things were presented in a fair-minded way it would be different. Mohammad, Thomas Jefferson, Pope John Paul, the Bishops and Cardinals in Boston and other dioceses, all should bear the consequences of their actions -- as should the Hebrew Prophets who created a milieu where woman were second class citizens. But we must also take into account the era in which some of these actions took place.\n \n Anyway, the best anyone can do is to speak out against anti-Semitism, Jesus-bashing, Christian-bashing, Islamophobia, Mohammad-bashing, homophobia, misogyny, and injustice in all forms, whenever and wherever one can. The sooner we can make bigotry anathema in our world, the sooner we will have that \"life more abundant\" that is promised in the Gospels - that is my take on it because I am Christian.\nI don't know if I am responding to Orion or Howard Beale in this post. Please advise.\n \nIt is a sad commentary that there is such bigotry displayed toward Islam.\nI don't know if I can be considered a bigot or not but I am rabidly opposed to certain Islamic practices regarding slavery and the treatment of women. Islam is out of step with the progress made in the world in regard to slavery and women.\n \n I truly believe that if Mohammed were to write the Koran in present times that he would create a very different document from the one that he created in the Seventh Century of Christendom.\n \n The Koran was one of the most progressive religious documents in the world at the time of its creation. I admire the poetry of Mohammed's writing, his success in tackling the onerous task of essentially creating rules covering almost everything within a society--rules that were relatively progressive for the times. However, the times have changed.\n \n Slavery is no longer acceptable.\n \n Unequal treatment of women is no longer acceptable.\n \n The Koran must be criticized by scholars of the Koran and made more modern.\n \n In the meantime, I follow Freyja, the warrior goddess of love, and, if necessary, we will wage warfare against Islam. And Roman Catholicism, if that church seeks to impose its unjust rule over women. And any patriarchal religion which oppresses women.",

   "Hi Simone - you are responding to my post.\n \n \nI don't know if I can be considered a bigot or not but I am rabidly opposed to certain Islamic practices regarding slavery and the treatment of women. Islam is out of step with the progress made in the world in regard to slavery and women.\nI am familiar with your thoughts on many subjects and I do not think that there is any way for anyone to consider you, or the positions you hold, to be bigoted. You have points of view, strong ones in certain areas, but you do not hold to your views in the rigid way of a bigot - you seek and question and allow other information to effect your positions. You also do not paint an entire race of people or believers with one broad brushstroke. Just look at your words: \"I am opposed to certain Islamic practices.\" That is not the statement of a bigot. A bigot would say \"All Muslims do this or do that...\" You don't paint with the broad brushstrokes of prejudice.\n \n \nI truly believe that if Mohammed were to write the Koran in present times that he would create a very different document from the one that he created in the Seventh Century of Christendom.\nNo question. So would Moses - all those misogynous \"laws\" in Leviticus would be gone. Mohammed and Moses, different than Jesus were political leaders as well as spiritual leaders. As such they were more grounded in their time and culture.\n \n \nThe Koran was one of the most progressive religious documents in the world at the time of its creation. I admire the poetry of Mohammed's writing, his success in tackling the onerous task of essentially creating rules covering almost everything within a society--rules that were relatively progressive for the times. However, the times have changed.\n \n Slavery is no longer acceptable.\n \n Unequal treatment of women is no longer acceptable.\n \n The Koran must be criticized by scholars of the Koran and made more modern.\nI don't think you will find an Imam or Muslim scholar who will \"criticize\" the Qur'an, just like you won't find a rabbi who will criticize the Torah or a Christian who will criticize the teachings of Jesus. You will however find Imams, rabbis and ministers who will interpret their respective scriptures from the viewpoint of the 21st Century -- who will say that certian things were applicable at different times and in different places. Different than Judaism or Christianity, Islam has been, for the most part, a third world religious phenomenon and as such has not been as exposed to modern western philosophies and therefore has not been as modulated by them.\n \n \nIn the meantime, I follow Freyja, the warrior goddess of love, and, if necessary, we will wage warfare against Islam. And Roman Catholicism, if that church seeks to impose its unjust rule over women. And any patriarchal religion which oppresses women.\nI would hope that you will seek to change those aspects of those religions that are detrimental to society and not those aspects of those religions that are beneficial. I do not think you mean to wage war on entire religions because some of the believers in those religions cling to archaic notions. That does smack of biotry and I don't think you intended it that way.\n \n All the best.",

   "I agree that there's a degree of blurring in any system. \n\n \n \nI agree that Muslim states should have fairer laws for women.\n\n \n Given that you argue that there are differing views on Islam, why is it that they do not have fairer laws? (I believe it's because it's hard for them to argue against their own premise that the laws given them are immutable)\n \n \n \n \nOne can suppose that these people are indeed misrepresenting their position and duping heaps of Moslems, and that it's escaped the news, and there's no howls from Moslems declaring that they're insulting the prophet... \n\n \nThere are many different Muslim positions on every issue. I might as well ask why I haven't heard howls of protest over the websites I linked you to of hate-filled Christians\n\n \n Given that the sites you link are irrelevant, and you've still been unable/unwilling to show why they are relevant, I still make no direct comment about them. I've challenged you to show a link between the teachings of Christ and what they teach. The best you've done is go off on a tangent and attacked Buddhism by another similar irrelevant argument (showing no causal links).\n \n \nThat is what I have said. We differ over out understanding of 'truth'. I see that Islam views its faith as 'true' and that people who deny this (as shown in the citations I've made) are therefore justifiably condemned.\n \n It is argued by some that there's the sense of 'abrogation' which he himself raised - though it actually goes against him anyway.\n When Muhammad started out he was in a minority position, and all the declarations for Allah at that time are of being peaceful and living well with everyone. As he got stronger in power, his verses become (not surprisingly for some) more belligerent.\n \n And it is believed that the more belligerent verses coming after the others abrogate the earlier ones. You need to know that the more peaceful verses took place early on. That is why they can point to a verse that says \"There shall be no compulsion in religion\" and still happily sentence someone to death for apostasy.\n\n \nHow do we know which verses are earlier?\n\n \n We look to Islamic records; again what they believe to be so. However you'd simply pipe up and say that there must be some dissent, and simply by the fact that one may find a dissenter, no one can know the truth of the matter.\n \n \nAs for abrogation, its only used in extreme circumstances: if two verse can be kept simultaneously, they will be. The verses that you give rely on interpretation to condemn Jews and Christians. The ones Howard gave require no such outside interpretation, and are therefore more reliable Qu'ranic truth\n\n \n No. The verses Howard showed are superseded by the more belligerent ones. You've ignored me saying that earlier. But then you both want to argue an issue about what Muslims understand about abrogation, and then also argue that I can't state with any certainty about what Moslems believe; thus you're able to discern something you believe I can not. Well done. But I think it's more a case you wish to invent and try any and every argument all at once, so long as one can't condemn the marriage of Muhammad to Aisha, which you've not stated it wrong, by any standard.\n \n \nI sometimes make the very basic mistake of mixing up Hadith and Koran, even though it's such a fundamental error. So often I try to just use the generic \"Islamic texts...\"\n\n \nWell, many Muslims hold the Hadith very highly, but it shouldn't be confused with the Qu'ran.\n\n \n I agree.\n \n \nI did not argue that at all. I asked you to show how that kind of behaviour is seen as an example. And you've not done this; you've simply repeated that the events DID happen.\n I even tried to give you an example about how this can work, and fail; as with King David.\n\n \nI also pointed out that Buddha is seen as an already enlightened being by most Buddhists and therefore would not make mistakes. The thervada might say that at this point he was not enlightened, but I've never seen his desertion of her attacked by Buddhists. She eventually become a disciple, as does his son.\n\n \n No, you've made the same argument about Buddha, that you believe I've made about Islam; and citing non-Buddhist sources.\n \n \nThen you're argument is confused. You either now acknowledge that the 'evidence' against Buddhism is 'hate-filled', or it's accurate. Which is it?\n\n \nThe Christian sites are about other things: gays, other religions, criminals of any kind.\n\n \n How they relate to Christian teaching is still only known to you.\n \n \nIncidentally, the evidence being factual or not has little impact on whether those who use it are hate-filled.\n\n \n I've never understood the idea of a fact being hate-filled. Please explain.\n \n \nAgain, I note to that there is some blurring. One could argue over the merits of an age of consent of 18 or 17 with just as much evidence, however Islam says it's linked to puberty, that there's some kind of instant adult capability at the onset of puberty - because a girl is deemed a woman three months after menstruation -like there's no 'teen' years. She just goes from child to woman.\n\n \nBeing a teenager is a very modern, Western conception.\n\n \n Still, you've yet to show me the evidence that shows how a girl who reaches the beginning of her journey to physical maturity has instantaneously acquired emotional and mental maturity. But then again you're not keen on structuring an argument based on evidence.",

Even the right of life could be in question, since it was not uncommon for small girls to be buried alive during times of scarcity. In the Qur'an, it is said that on Judgment Day \"buried girls\" will rise out of their graves and ask for what crime they were killed. Part of Muhammad's legacy was to end infanticide and establish explicit rights for women.\n \n Islam teaches that men and women are equal before God. It grants women divinely sanctioned inheritance, property, social and marriage rights, including the right to reject the terms of a proposal and to initiate divorce. The American middle-class trend to include a prenuptial agreement in the marriage contract is completely acceptable in Islamic law. In Islam's early period, women were professionals and property owners, as many are today. Although in some countries today the right of women to initiate divorce is more difficult than intended, this is a function of patriarchal legislation and not an expression of Islamic values. Muhammad himself frequently counseled Muslim men to treat their wives and daughters well. \"You have rights over your women,\" he is reported to have said, \"and your women have rights over you.\"",

It is easy to smear someone on hearsay when that person is not around to defend themselves &#8211; and when the alleged crime was committed 1500 years ago and the hearsay evidence is taken down over a hundred years after the event.\n\n Given you've cited no evidence that substantiates claims about the lack of adherence to the quality of the hadith, I see no more 'point' again from you.\n \n\n It is perfectly valid to criticize a Muslim (or anyone else) for citing those Hadiths to justify their sexual perversions. However, as you agree, most Muslims don&#8217;t do that.\n\n Nice twist. Indeed most don't but most don't condemn it; because of the axiom that the prophet was beyond reproach.",

   "Given that most accept the Hadith, the Hadith say she was nine, and that Islamic clerics continue to advise based on this 'example' then I don't see what your argument is.\nIt is no more a \"given\" that most Islamic clerics accept Hadiths as infallible than it is that most Christians believe the Bible should be taken literally and the creation happened in seven days.

If someone were to say that some Catholic priests and bishops are homosexuals, pedophiles, child abusers and child molesters, all would agree.

So, the teachings of moderate Islamic clerics that it is not an acceptable practice for men today has more influence; therefore they may be more representative.\n \n \nGiven you've cited no evidence that substantiates claims about the lack of adherence to the quality of the hadith, I see no more 'point' again from you.\nYou misunderstand me. We cannot condemn a man who lived almost 1500 years ago, who is not here to speak for himself, just because of a few paragraphs in a book written a century after he died. You have implied a condemnation of Mohammad himself on that unverifiable hearsay.\n \n \nIndeed most don't but most don't condemn it; because of the axiom that the prophet was beyond reproach.\nYou cannot say that \"most [Islamic clerics] don't condemn it\" unless you have availed yourself of all the evidence out there by reading the writings of most Islamic clerics. That is the kind of statement that I take issue with. Have you read the major Islamic scholars on the issue dating back to Rumi, a 13th Century Islamic scholar or the modern writings of the Islamic scholars I have mentioned and westerners like Martin Lings and David Tracey? It is irresponsible to make the statement that \"most don't condemn it\" when you have not read the major Islamic theologians and historians.",

And the Hadith (the most widely accepted one) says that Muhammed consummated marriage with a nine year old girl.\n \n One commentator on the Hadith has supposed that she had reached puberty.\n \n Even if she had, there's no evidence that I'm aware of (despite asking people here to show it), there there's a meaningful link between the onset of physical maturity and an instantaneous transference to adulthood in mental and emotional states - this must be 'so' in Islam because they deem a girl who has reached puberty (+ 3 months) to be an 'adult'... supposedly confering on her all adult rights.\n \n They do this BECAUSE Muhammed married a young person. They themsleves believe Muhammed to be an example for all men, for all time.\n \n Not all Moslems will marry children, but then again Muhammed married a Jewess, a Christian, an older woman, etc (9 wives). Not all Moslem men will marry an older woman, either. BUT BECAUSE Muhammed did so, it is permissable.",

I mentioned this because of your continuous distorting - stating and/or inferring \"all Muslims\" and \"most Muslims\" believe what you claim. You have not substantiated most of those assertions. Rumi is a best selling Islamic scholar and writer. That establishes more credibility for him than any Islamic scholar you cite -- and you cite very few Islamic scholars, mostly websites like the last one which does not refer to any Islamic scholar upon whom they base their information. \n\n Rumi is a best-selling poet.\n \n\n Cite some major mainstream Islamic scholars to support your statements and that might increase your credibility.\n\n Given you're yet to address your own poor citations, you already ignore the fact I've actually cited many Islamic sites.

You may want to concentrate on the 'citation' aspect of my quibble, but I'd rather you concentrate on the 'relevance' aspect.\n \n To that, every citation I have made you would simply reply \"It's not representative of Islam\"... ignoring of course what would then have to be a very large conspiracy; dozens of Muslims setting up web-sites, tricking Muslims to write to them for expert opinion, and only you see through them all :)\n \n As to 'goal-shift' it's already been covered. They would not call her a 'girl' but a woman; because they simply re-define such a person, pretend she's capable of consent, and then it's NOT considered child abuse. So I doubt too that I'd be able to find too may a site of Muslims claiming that child sex is okay... although I have cited them saying if she is 'capable of' sex.",

   "You contend that all Muslims take the Qur'an and Hadiths literally. I have cited major Islamic scholars and theologians who do not. Your thesis that all Muslims take the Qur'an literally is thereby brought into question.\n\n That is false.\n I have said that Aisha was nine based on the hadith, that most Muslims accept.\n \n To which you 'cite' (using the most liberal of definitions of the word), a poet stating that the great books of the world's religions should not be taken literally.\n \n There's a vast chasm between stating that, and saying Aisha was NOT nine.\n \n It's akin to me making a statement about the resurrection of Jesus as understood by the majority of Christians, and you citing a truism that Catholics and Lutherans interpret the Bible differently. That would, as noted, be true, but in no way expresses anything to do with them having a different understanding of the resurrection.\n \n So, I've asked you again, and again, and again to contextualise your 'citation'. You have not refuted the age of Aisha.\n \n I understand that some Moslem apologists might not agree that Aisha is nine; they would be in a minority. The majority, as I have cited, say that they believe the Hadith.\n \n So unless you can show your poet saying something relevant to the thread, then you should bow out, unless you have some other 'evidence' to provide.\n \n You need to show how your poet makes comments on either Aisha, or in some better context on that hadith, and then show how his view on this is widespread; as you maintain that a great deal of Moslems don't agree with the Aisha-nine years old idea (ALL my citations say she was).\n \n\n You smear all Muslims with the same slime and yet the website advice column you cite does not say what (if any) mainstream Islamic scholars or theologians support your contentions. You do not cite the credentials, let alone the name, of translator of the version of the Qur'an you quote from. That makes both your supporting references invalid.\n\n Waxing hyperbole now? I guess that passes for debate in some circles.",
