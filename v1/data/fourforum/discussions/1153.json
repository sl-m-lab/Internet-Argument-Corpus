First, you are correct that different groups do different things and often condemn where innappropriate. However, the Bible is correct. People are the ones incorrect. The question then becomes who do you trust concerning judgement? \n \n Your explanation has helped. Still, God judges. Not the bible not the church not anyone else. Period. I know of Zero christians that disagree on that point. Now, given that judgement belongs to God, it becomes unimportant for us to try to judge and even sinful. Therefore, My answer is still God. \n \n As christians our duty is to realize that God is judge and that some do not know the saving grace of Jesus. We are to be lights to the world. Live a Holy life. We are to be perfect. (scripture actually says that.) However, you say (or will say) that no one is perfect. We are to be perfect in the sense that while our behavior may not be perfect, there is no reason for us to hide these imperfections because they no longer define us.\n \n God has defined us AS perfect. Therefore we can live unhidden from the world and incorporate the grace of God into our daily lives. Judgement of others is irrelevant and should not be considered.\n \n Christians should use discernment to determine good and evil and this is learned in contact with the Holy Spirit. Judgement, from a christian point of view, does not just indicate \"good or bad\" (I hate that phrase but it will have to do), but includes also the condemnation or sentence. Just like in a court. It is a legal term. Judgement not only implies guilt but the punishment to follow. \n \n Therfore, I still vote God. Not church or bible.",

God did not reveal everything in the bible. There is much that is still a mystery. Additionally, the bible has no power. Only God has the power to judge. God is infinite. The bible is finite. \n \n Your questions are really quite good. Most people would ask those questions with an intent to prove, you seem to seek to understand. Thanks.",
