   "Although this is news to me, I'm not a bit surprised by the allegations. And praise the Lord for honest Democrats like Jerry Zeifman. Evidently they're still out there doing the right thing. This just confirms that Hillary has always been morally deficient with no redeeming values at all. It also speaks volumes about the moral character of the democratic party itself that such a corrupt woman of low character could rise so high within the Party, rather than being forced out by the powers that be. Here's an excerpt from your link. \n The now-retired general counsel and chief of staff of the House Judiciary Committee, who supervised Hillary when she worked on the Watergate investigation, says Hillary's history of lies and unethical behavior goes back farther - and goes much deeper - than anyone realizes.\n \n Jerry Zeifman, a lifelong Democrat, supervised the work of 27-year-old Hillary Rodham on the committee. Hillary got a job working on the investigation at the behest of her former law professor, Burke Marshall, who was also Sen. Ted Kennedy's chief counsel in the Chappaquiddick affair. When the investigation was over, Zeifman fired Hillary from the committee staff and refused to give her a letter of recommendation - one of only three people who earned that dubious distinction in Zeifman's 17-year career.\n \n Why?\n \n \"Because she was a liar,\" Zeifman said in an interview last week. \"She was an unethical, dishonest lawyer. She conspired to violate the Constitution, the rules of the House, the rules of the committee and the rules of confidentiality.\"\n \n How could a 27-year-old House staff member do all that? She couldn't do it by herself, but Zeifman said she was one of several individuals - including Marshall, special counsel John Doar and senior associate special counsel (and future Clinton White House Counsel) Bernard Nussbaum - who engaged in a seemingly implausible scheme to deny Richard Nixon the right to counsel during the investigation.\n \n Why would they want to do that? Because, according to Zeifman, they feared putting Watergate break-in mastermind E. Howard Hunt on the stand to be cross-examined by counsel to the president. Hunt, Zeifman said, had the goods on nefarious activities in the Kennedy Administration that would have made Watergate look like a day at the beach - including Kennedy's purported complicity in the attempted assassination of Fidel Castro.\n \n The actions of Hillary and her cohorts went directly against the judgment of top Democrats, up to and including then-House Majority Leader Tip O'Neill, that Nixon clearly had the right to counsel. Zeifman says that Hillary, along with Marshall, Nussbaum and Doar, was determined to gain enough votes on the Judiciary Committee to change House rules and deny counsel to Nixon. And in order to pull this off, Zeifman says Hillary wrote a fraudulent legal brief, and confiscated public documents to hide her deception.\n ",

Now, Zeifman draws on that diary to give us Without Honor: Crimes of Camelot and the Impeachment of President Nixon, in which he accuses government officials of obstructing the impeachment inquiry. Their reason? Not any sympathy for the besieged Richard Nixon, but a desire to protect the reputation of John Kennedy. Zeifman's book will surely excite conspiracy buffs on the lookout for sinister coverups in high places. But those wary of such unsubstantiated theories (myself included) will find Zeifman's book an unconvincing, if imaginative, tale of intrigue.\n \n Zeifman's theory goes something like this: John Doar, Hillary Rodham, Bernard Nussbaum and other Kennedy loyalists investigating Nixon obstruct his impeachment \"to cover up malfeasance in high office throughout the Cold War.\" The scheming starlets are abetted by Peter Rodino, a weak, corrupt chairman of the House Judiciary Committee who is afraid that Nixon might expose his own Mafia ties. Rounding out the list of conspirators is Burke Marshall, Robert Kennedy's assistant attorney general, who orchestrates the bogus investigation in the hopes of keeping Nixon in office, which will, he believes, help Ted Kennedy win the White House. Using a variety of dubious legal strategies -- still with me? -- Doar and his co-conspirators do everything they can to avoid putting the president on trial, a strategy, they hope, that will prevent Nixon's lawyers from revealing the \"crimes of Camelot.\"\n \n The lack of evidence makes this theory hard to swallow. Zeifman's most reliable source -- his diary -- contains few revelations and seems little more than a chronicle of his suspicions and speculations. The book's jacket cover, which promises readers \"truths even more startling than those brought out in Oliver Stone's movies 'Nixon' and 'JFK', \" does not help matters. Perhaps the book's publicists forgot that \"Nixon\" and \"JFK\" were, after all, only Hollywood movies.\n \n http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/reviews/matthewdallek.htm\n \n --------\n \n Not to mention that Mr. Zeifman's claim that he fired Hillary Clinton \"is undermined by his own previous reported acknowledgment [in a 1998 Sacramento Bee article] that he did not fire Clinton and did not have the power to do so.\"\n \n http://mediamatters.org/items/200804040011\n \n emoticon_cool",
