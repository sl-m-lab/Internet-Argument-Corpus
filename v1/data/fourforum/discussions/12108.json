   "NATO and independent contractors are ready to pay Tallibs for safety of convoys destined for international contingent in Afghanistan! \n \n Swiss Supreme Global Solutions protecting oil and foodstuffs supplies to NATO contingent engaged not in supply only but in financing of Taliban field commanders! The fact is that in connection of activation of militants movements the suppliers were forced to build ties with terrorists for keeping convoys safe! Daily 60-100 vehicles move to Peshawar and vendors are paying $1000 for security of each unit of equipment! Can you image how much money Taliban get for guaranteeing of NATO mission realized in Afghanistan!\n Interestingly, Swiss pay wages for Taliban militants but have the cheek to cover it! Eyewitnesses say that in addition to it by Taliban support Supreme Global Solutions is in criminal trade with organs and drugs!\n I think that fabulous profits fell into Swiss officials' accounts! And NATO need to investigate those facts otherwise we'll be able to start thinking of Afghanistan mission as criminal, not anti-terrorism actually! And this war will never stop before we continue to finance terrorists! The wolf knows what the ill beast thinks!",

   "Afghan officials say that almost 70 civilians were killed during the NATO air strike in the northern province of Kunduz washingtonpost . com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/06/AR2009090602209.html. What is it? Is it another mistake of the top NATO Command, which \"will never happen again\"? \n I say, it's high time to face reality: NATO doesn't promote the development of true democracy in Afghanistan. The only thing NATO troops succeeded in is a bombing of local people. Is it possible to speak about jural society in that country now in view of the fact that NATO doesn't even admit rights of locals to life?",
