   "When the Bush administration sends America's sons and daughters into combat I suspect there won't be too many sons and daughters of the Bush administration among them. In all the news accounts I have read I have not come across any reference to a close relative of Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Perle or Wolfowitz currently serving in the military. You know Karl Rove would have hauled them out for a photo-op with Bush by now if there were any in uniform.\n \n My point is quite simple. It's alot easier to send young Americans inot war when none of them are your relatives. I don't even suspect the conservative warhawks have many relatives in the military. It's just not their style.\n \n Bush evaded service in Vietnam. When he had the chance to walk the walk, he ran the other way. His daddy got him in the national guard. He was sworn in the day he applied, even though there was an 18 month waiting list normally. He skipped boot camp, even though normally this is only done by doctors and lawyers. He quit flying when a mandatory drug screen was instituted. He was AWOL for the last year of his national guard obligation. He sure showed he was a patriot then.\n \n It's alot easier to wage a war when you are jeopardizing the lives of the middle class and poor folks who live across the tracks. When the dead and injured start coming home from Iraq you can bet Bush will rund down to a military hospital to get all teary-eyed and publicly patriotic. But it will be an easy gig for him. He knows that he'll never run into the son or daughter of anyone he knows.\n \n We will sure miss the posts of all you supporters of the war who are 18 and over. I'm certain you will be joining the military so you can fight for what you say you believe in. If not, then your are certainly a hypocrite who wants others to die in your place.",

I guess those terrorist training camps in Iraq are just there for looks right. Maybe you should look at history, exactly who we were making war on when the WTC was hit? Let me guess it was our policy with Isreal. So we should just stop sending aid to Isreal and our problems will go away right. So what if they start blowing up buildings demanding other things, like our women be clothed from head to foot and all of our males start wearing beards, we should just give in for the sake of peace right.\n WRONG this is not France, we do not just give in to every lunatic on the planet that likes to bully people into doing things.\n I say we should hit them before they hit us.\n \n Oh and I am one of those \"conservative warhawks\" and I am currently serving in the military.\n \n Point being, dont use my life and the lives of my fellow soldiers to make a point on politics.",
