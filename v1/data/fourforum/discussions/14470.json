   "Great, now we have Ganso and Bennedict speaking in tongues. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n I agree with Pappillion; a woman can't expect any man to think above the waist.\n \n Zardos, I think you posted waaaay TMI there, buddy. emoticon_xclown\n But since you chose to bare all, I'll offer my diagnosis...\n Sounds to me like you have found the perfect match but, you don't want to commit to a monogamous relationship that may interfere with your kinky sexual activities. In other words, you are thinking with your dick and not listening to your heart. \n \n It's been my experience that both the woman and the man have to have a mutual sexual attraction in order for the relationship to go that direction, obviously. So, for a man and a woman to be nothing more than friends, they both have to want the same thing or it won't work - the sex or the friendship.\n \n That'll be $100, thank you. I accept PayPal only. emoticon_xclown",

   "WHHHAAAAAAAAAAA???? hahaha! well, i respect your decision, i probably wouldnt be that strong. i made that mistake once, where i dated a really good friend of mine in high school and it ended badly, now i wish i hadnt dated her so we could still be friends.\n \n for the record, i was kidding about the construction lady. she was ugg. definitely an owner of male genitalia. not that i can confirm that or anything.\n\n \n Actually, I've seen some female construction workers that were quite attractive.\n \n \n \n @Sandycane.\n \n I'm actually a 100% monogamous male and VERY commitment oriented. \n I don't think with my peen at ALL (although it tries to usurp power at times...but, I forcefully have to beat that sucker down, show him who's the boss...now, is THAT TMI? LOL). \n I also don't participate in the BDSM community...as said, I'm a 'champion for a cause.' As I mentioned, much like a hetero person championing for gay rights. But, I am active in the community. I tend to be able to easily single out the kinky/pervy people in a normal setting...and direct them towards the community. I'm a facilitator. Also very much a social butterfly. And, I REEK of trust. Probably one of the most trustworthy males around. It's that personal integrity thing coupled with a mentor/paternal/teacher personality.\n \n Currently, I'm voluntarily in a celibate/single phase and have been so for a few months. Mostly with getting my life back in order. But, will probably end it by Oct. \n \n But, as to the BFF. I've actually had to turn to some other female friends as I can't 'read' her that well. And I am an empath. Unfortunatly, the BFF is a muse. So, I fear some of her mannerisms being un/conscious changes to accomodate me. The chameleon. And, when you encounter a VERY attractive person who is muse-like...yeeeaaahhh. Very confusing for me. More so as I am a long term relationship person and she might not be. \n There has been a lot of 'signals' that normally I'd interpret as high interest by her but, at times she has shown the opposite too. \n Sigh. Don't you hate 'mixed signals'?\n \n I figure in a week or so, I'll confront her. I tend to be VERY direct. I believe that after this time, she'll be over part of a hump she's been dealing with for a while...RN schooling. She'll hopefully have a clearer head then.\n \n Thanks for the time.",

   "Seems like I was wrong in my diagnosis...you'll get a full refund. emoticon_xclown\n \n Here, maybe this will help:\n Virgo: Today's Free Daily Horoscope - Astrology.com\n emoticon_xhoho\n \n The last 'serious' relationship I was in, after 3 months into it, the guy showed his true colors as a narcissistic sociopath. After showing him to the back door with a baseball bat, he continued stalking and harassing me with phone calls and emails for more than a year. Luckily, he was forced to move out of the county and that was the end of it.\n \n Needless to say, I've not been interested in getting involved with anyone else since then. That was 6 years ago...and I've never been happier or more content in my life.\n I guess I should thank him for curing me from thinking I needed a man to depend on to survive. emoticon_xhoho\n \n My best friend, however, is an ex-boyfriend. He would love for it to be physical but, knows I don't and we get along just fine the way things are.\n We are neighbors, he lives his life, I live mine, and we spend quality time together when we can.\n I must say though, I would miss him if he were to hook up with another woman in a serious relationship...if that were to happen, I might have to reconsider my position. emoticon_rolleyes",
