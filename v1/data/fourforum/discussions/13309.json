   "  Mother killed herself and daughter in car fire over gang's abuse \n A mother who killed herself and her disabled daughter had been terrorised by a gang of youths and had her repeated pleas for help ignored by police, an inquest was told yesterday. \n \n ...\n \n The single mother, her daughter and teenage son, Anthony, had endured ten years of being virtual prisoners in their own home as a gang of up to 16 \"street kids\" tormented them for simply \"existing\"\n \n Despite Mrs Pilkington and her family repeatedly calling the police and reporting that they had received death threats, she was told to close her curtains and ignore the children, a jury was told. A Leicestershire Police log shows that she called them more than twenty times in seven years to say that her severely dyslexic son's life had been threatened, her daughter, who had acute special needs, was being bullied and her house was under attack from the gang of youths. \n\n  I know a bit about this myself.  However the difference is that I was allowed to carry a gun under the reasonable man statute. \n \n An Armed person truly cannot be bullied! The old saying is. God created man and Samuel Colt made them equal! Old, disabled, female and all, are on an equal footing with these vicious predators!",

There is a possible 2 million Defensive Gun Uses each year. (DGU's) Most all of the time, no one is ever shot.\n \n The Police either can't be everywhere all of the time, or won't, in this case, help you! Like Annie Le, or the Los Angeles riots, there are not enough cops to protect you. And in fact a Supreme Court case that says that they don't even have to.\n \n This story is a case of a mother being Sooo frustrated, and living in fear ALL OF THE TIME, and not being able to get the help she needed, that she believed the only way out of this situation was to take her own, and her famliy's lives. \n \n When I lives in that Cleveland Housing Project, that was the way many of the residents felt! They were scared to death! Children slept UNDER THEIR BEDS, instead of on them! I hope you get that, if nothing else I say!\n \n When the predators in YOUR neighborhood start harassing YOUR Family, and you call the police, and find out that they are really powerless to help you, it is them when you realize that the only one who is actually responsible to protect you and your family is YOU! \n \n Luckily, for that single mother, she had me to do that for them as well. Having a firearm, and the OK to carry it, made all of the difference for me, because I had power equal to the gang, and the ability to dispose of the threat. \n \n That was comforting! I can't begin to tell you how I would have felt if I were unarmed, and worrying about constant retaliation, from these predator thugs! \n \n When punks are harassing you in your home, and you have the assurance that they can only go so far, because you have a gun in your home, and if they come in, you can and will deal with that, if makes all of the difference in the world to you! When you don't, you cower in fear every waking, and sleepless moment!\n \n Then there are crocked cops!  Ex-D.C. Officer Among 12 Charged in Drug Case When they have the very police that are supposed to protect you on their side You and Your Family are Toast! \n \n I hope you get that!",

Joy Powell, who has run a shop there for 20 years, said it was not uncommon for local youths to carry weapons openly.\n \n \"It's very sad what's happening here. The area is full of gangs of youths and undesirables. I close my shop at 5.30pm, or earlier, every day and go straight home. I don't tend to go out at night at all as it's too frightening. The gangs have no respect. They carry baseball bats, carving knives and even guns.\" \n\n \n   Gangs of New Britain \n\n \n Manchester\n Organised crime is run by the Noonan family of north Manchester. Dessie Noonan, murdered last year, once boasted: \"No one dare touch us. I've got a bigger army than the police. I've got more guns than the police.\" He was said by police to be linked to 25 murders, although Dessie claimed the real figure was 27. His younger brother Dominic, now the gang kingpin, runs his own system of self-styled justice across the city. Known for its brutality and torture, the 14-strong family has made millions, mainly from drugs and money laundering.\n Glasgow \n The city's most famous gangster is Tam \"The Licensee\" McGraw. Having started as an armed robber, he is now at the helm of Glasgow's premier crime gang. Again, drugs are its favoured racket. The smaller but equally violent Daniel and Lloyd clans have reputations for being drive-by killers.\n Birmingham\n The top gang is the Burger Bar Boys, who specialise in crack cocaine, money and guns. They have terrorised the city for 20 years and take their name from the cafe in which they met. They are led by a shadowy 51-year-old who has close links with London and Manchester gangs. Children as young as 11 are said to have been recruited in the past year and allegedly given guns and grenades. In the past six years gun crime in Birmingham has increased 600 per cent - much of it down to the BBB.\n Nottingham\n The Meadows Gang and the St Ann's Clan have been slugging it out for supremacy for years. Even Nottingham's Chief Constable, Steve Green, admits: \"My force is reeling in a long-standing crisis situation.\" In the past year one gun-related injury has been reported every week, including five deaths and 23 serious woundings. The city is infamous for being the first infiltrated by Jamaican Yardies.\n Liverpool\n Yet another feud between rival gangs has left three dead and dozens wounded as warring factions battle for control of the city's multi-million pound heroin and crack cocaine trade. Their favoured weapons are machine guns and knives and there has even been one bomb attack on a police station.\n",

   "\n So then Bryan why do you feel like being a true american patriot and exercising your god given rights? Oh wait that question kind of answers itself.\n\n \n \n Because I still can.\n \n ---\n \n \n \"The most foolish mistake we could possibly make would be to allow the subject races to possess arms. History shows that all conquerors who have allowed their subject races to carry arms have prepared their own downfall by so doing. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that the supply of arms to the underdogs is a sine qua non for the overthrow of any sovereignty. So let's not have any native militia or native police. German troops alone will bear the sole responsibility for the maintenance of law and order throughout the occupied Russian territories, and a system of military strong-points must be evolved to cover the entire occupied country.\" Adolf Hitler, dinner talk on April 11, 1942, quoted in Hitler's Table Talk 1941-44: His Private Conversations, Second Edition (1973), Pg. 425-426.\n \n And that the said Constitution be never construed to authorize Congress to infringe the just liberty of the Press, or the rights of Conscience; or to prevent the people of the United States , who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms. . . Samuel Adams, Debates & Proceedings in the Convention of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts , 86-87 (February 6, 1788).\n \n Among the many misdeeds of the British rule in India , history will look upon the Act depriving a whole nation of arms as the blackest. If we want the Arms Act to be repealed, if we want to learn the use of arms, here is a golden opportunity. If the middle class render voluntary help to Government in the hour of its trial, distrust will disappear, and the ban on possessing arms will be withdrawn. Ghandi, 2 M. Gandhi, An Autobiography of the Story of My Experiments with the Truth, p. 374 (M. Desai, trans. 1927).\n \n The right of self-defense is the first law of nature; in most governments it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest possible limits...and [when] the right of the people to keep and bear arms is, under any color or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of destruction. Sir George Tucker, Judge of the Virginia Supreme Court and U.S. District Court of Virginia , in I Blackstone COMMENTARIES, Sir George Tucker Ed., 1803, pg. 300.\n \n If the opposition disarms, well and good. If it refuses to disarm, we shall disarm it ourselves. Joseph Stalin, Reply to the discussion on the Political Reports of the Central Committee, Dec. 7, 1927. Stalin, Works, Vol. 10, p. 378. From Congressional Record, April 28, 1970, p. H3601.\n \n Foolish liberals who are trying to read the Second Amendment out of the Constitution by claiming it's not an individual right or that it's too much of a safety hazard don't see the danger of the big picture. They're courting disaster by encouraging others to use the same means to eliminate portions of the Constitution they don't like. Alan Dershowitz, quoted in David T. Hardy, The Conceptual Foundations of Anglo-American Jurisprudence in Religion and Reason, 62 Tenn L. Rev. 759 (1995).\n \n I honestly think - and I am not an expert on the amendments - I think the only people in this nation who should be allowed to own guns are police officers. I don't care if you want to hunt, I don't care if you think it's your right. I say 'sorry'. It is 1999, we have had enough as a nation. You are not allowed to own a gun and if you do own a gun, I think you should go to prison. Rosie O'Donnell, The Rosie O'Donnell Show, April 21, 1999.\n \n The great ideals of liberty and equality are preserved against the assaults of opportunism, the expediency of the passing hour, the erosion of small encroachments, the scorn and derision of those who have no patience with general principles, by enshrining them in constitutions, and consecrating to the task of their protection a body of defenders. Justice Benjamin Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process, Lecture II, 1921.\n \n And so a lot of people say there's too much personal freedom. When personal freedom's being abused, you have to move to limit it. That's what we did in the announcement I made last weekend on the public housing projects, about how we're going to have weapon sweeps and more things like that to try to make people safer in their communities. President Bill Clinton on MTV's ``Enough is Enough\", 3-22-94.\n \n Make mass searches and hold executions for found arms. V. I. Lenin, Collected Works, Vol. 35, 4th ed., p. 286. From Congressional Record, April 28, 1970, p. H3601.\n \n Pick a night and cordon off a section of South Dallas . Send hundreds of police officers--however many it would take-into the area to 'vacuum it up.' Shake down everybody on the street. Search every house and apartment. Confiscate all drugs and weapons. Ross Perot, The Washington Post, June 6, 1992.\n \n We're going to have to take one step at a time, and the first step is necessarily, given political realities, going to be very modest. Our ultimate goal, total control of handguns in the United States, is going to take time. The first problem is to slow down the increasing number of handguns in this country. The second problem is to get handguns registered, and the final problem is to make the possession of all handguns, and all handgun ammunition illegal. Nelson T. Shields, founder of the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence and former Chairman of Handgun Control, Inc, in The New Yorker magazine, July 26, 1976, at Page 53f.\n \n Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the Government's purposes are beneficent. Men born to freedom are naturally alert to repel invasion of their liberty by evil-minded rulers. The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding.  Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 485 (1928) Justice Brandeis, dissenting.\n \n Are we at last brought to such an humiliating and debasing degradation that we cannot be trusted with arms for our own defense? Where is the difference between having our arms under our own possession and under our own direction, and having them under the management of Congress? If our defense be the real object of having those arms, in whose hands can they be trusted with more propriety, or equal safety to us, as in our own hands? Patrick Henry, 3 Elliot, Debates at 386.",
