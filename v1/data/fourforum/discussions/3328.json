And a church comes along and says \"Yes, this is how God formed the earth.... so that the animals all boarded onto the ark via land-bridges etc, and this church builds many rationales around the then current science. Then, 40 years down the track, there's a paradigm shift, we no longer hold that there were land bridges, but the continents themselves were directly joined to each other. Then, what happens to that church that rested it's theology in part on science. Science shifts all the time; I've no problem with that.\n \n It is why the Orthodox Church differs fundamentally in its approach to understanding God from the western churches. We actuall view the Catholic and Protestant churches as merely two sides of the same coin; both trying to use rationalistic argumens to understand God.\n You can, but there is a limit to this; this is because God is infinite, and therefore ultimately unknowable - but we can glimpse Him.\n We believe in noetic knowledge.",
