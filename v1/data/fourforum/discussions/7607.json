   "I actually walked about 2 miles to elementary school when I was a kid. I remember walking to school on days when the temperature was below 20F, and probably walked to school in temperatures much colder than that. If you have ever seen the movie \"A Christmas Story\", you have an idea of how I was dressed for my walk. The most direct route was through a town park with 3 baseball fields, a community pool, and several large recreation fields in the middle. Along the south side of this park was a small creek. This creek was normally a tame trickle, but I can recall times where the creek rose and flooded just about the entire park. It was not unusual for some of us to show up at school with our pants wet to the knees. Many people from my area of town who had to walk to school had the choice of either walking through the park, or going around it, which added probably at least another half mile to the walk. I would guess that approximately 40 of us used that park every day to and from school. The one thing I never actually got was that about 2 blocks away from my house (and 2 blocks closer to school) there was a bus stop that picked up kids from that street. However, Myself and many living on my street (farther from the school) were not eligible for the bus...go figure.\n \n We used to walk to school in all kinds of weather, cold, rain, wind, etc. We even used to go to school when they were predicting major snow storms. They would let us out only after it started snowing, forcing those of us \"walkers\" to walk home in a snow storm. And yes, buses used to drive in the snow as well. Now, probably due to peoples willingness to sue everyone over everything, it seems that kids get the day off school if they are predicting even a dusting of snow. I guess you can't be overly cautious. \n \n Looking back on all of it, I guess I got great exercise, although I probalby could have done without the freezing cold days and driving rains that forced me to sit through the first 4 hours of school sopping wet. Are kids spoiled these days...I guess that is a matter of perspective.",

Not all of them are being spoiled because not all of their parents can afford to do so. \n \n From the filthy rich to the barely above poverty level, parents are spoiling their children....especially in this day and age, with CARS. Children (and I do mean CHILDREN) are being given light-weight 200 horsepower road rockets to keep them in the popularity races that go on everywhere. This (the big car giveaway) doesn't appear to happen as much within the big cities where sometimes even the parents don't use cars much, but it is rampant in the suburbs and in smaller metros and rural areas. Children are killing and being killed because of their prematurely awarded driving privileges and their 'own' cars.\n \n Children are being spoiled in being allowed to determine their own food intake. That's been happening for a long time, too.\n \n Children are being spoiled in the clothing area. Again, popularity is at stake.\n \n Children are given entirely too much. What they should be given are lessons in working for pay that can be spent as they please. That's what a capitalist environment is about.\n \n I was given too much as a child and I'm betting that most of us were, regardless of when we were children.

The wind was blowing over the L-screen (the screen in front of the pitcher so he doesn't get killed) and it was just really really windy. I don't see how wind (unless it's like a tornado) could cancel school.\n \n In terms of the title, I saw a cartoon recently on the subject. It said something to the effect of \"parents spend their whole lives wanting to make life better for their kids, then they complain that we are 'spoiled' when they succeed\". Just thought that was kind of funny.\n \n On the general topic of kids being spoiled, it depends on the kid. Some kids are spoiled and some aren't. It's just the way parents are, they parent differently. Some parents let their kids sleep in and skip school if they're really tired (mostly seniors, but still). I went to school on time after I got back Sunday night at 2:30 AM. Now maybe it's just because I go to a generally poor school (over 50% on free and reduced lunch), but most kids today do not seem spoiled.

   "It isn't pre-eminent. As you agreed, \"A general principle is valid universally.\"\n \n A right isn't a right if sometimes a different right is \"pre-eminent\" and supercedes it. \n\n \n Then it follows that the property right does not supercedes liberty (freedom of speech) \n it also follows that not one right is more universal than another as you stated in your previous post: property right is more universal than freedom of speech. How can one universal be more universal than another. Illogical.\n \n \n \n \n \nSpurious argument. You can't make a rightful contract unless you have a right to make a contract. If rights exist they necessarily precede society. I don't believe in god. God and social contract don't exhaust the available options, this is a false dichotomy.\n\n \n Wrong. If you are Robinson Crusoe you don't need rights or looking at it from your point of view he has all rights. if you live outside society then where are your rights? would you demand rights? from whom? from God? Rights are individuals rights inside a society. No society no rights. Period\n \n Rights do not precede society our needs precede society. A bill of right is a codification of what we consider the minimum protection as individuals from other individuals and from our rulers.\n \n \nYou can't make a rightful contract unless you have a right to make a contract\n. \n \n and to have a right to make a contract you need a previous right and so on and so on ... \n \n Ridiculous, unless rights are assumed to be God given.\n \n We simply have a group of people who decide to enter in a social contract and the social contract has some clauses regarding the protection that indivuduals will have upon signing the contract, these protections are called human rights.\n What do you mean by saying that they need a 'right'? what do you mean by that, a letter of authorisation by a higher power, what ?\n \n I don't see how property rights can be extended to our own body, we are our own bodies. only rights to life, to freedom of movement, etc are pertinent to our own bodies not 'property rights' I went along with your bizarre extrapolation of property rights into the human body to show how absurd it is. \n \n How ridiculous the statement \"I have property rights over my body\" sounds.\n Kind of crazy although maybe not to an economist.",

Somewhere exists a person who created this website and presumabley pays a monthly fee for it to be hosted, just like you pay property taxes. That person owns this forum, and if he wanted to, he could legitimately come onto this forum, ban every single one of us for no reason, start posting his views, occasionally saying \"So none of you have the backbone to discuss this with me?\", and there wouldn't be a thing we could do about it, because it's his property and he would not be breaking any laws by doing that.\n \n \nProperty rights to my body?
