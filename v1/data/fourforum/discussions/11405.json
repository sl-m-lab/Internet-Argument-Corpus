   "NEW YORK - TruthWinsOut.org published exclusive comments today by Gary Remafedi, M.D., M.P.H., a professor of pediatrics at the University of Minnesota, who claimed the \"ex-gay\" organization PFOX distorted his research findings.\n \n On its website, PFOX expressed its displeasure with The Washington Post for publishing what it called \"a sympathetic article about a 15-year-old boy named Saro who described his homosexual feelings and how Gay Straight Alliance student clubs help such gay teens to deal with discrimination and bullying in high school and middle school.\"\n \n \"What the article failed to describe,\" said PFOX Executive Director Regina Griggs, \"is the danger of young sexually confused teens self-identifying as gays at an early age. Research has shown that the risk of suicide decreases by 20% each year that a person delays homosexual or bisexual self-labeling.* Early self-identification is dangerous to kids.\"\n \n Dr. Remafedi's study was the one cited by PFOX to back their unfounded conclusions. Today, Dr. Reamafedi released the following comments to Truth Wins Out: \"My work has been cited by PFOX in response to a Washington Post article on gay-straight alliances (GSA),\" wrote Dr. Remafedi. \"PFOX misuses one of my studies on suicide attempts in gay youth to argue that people should not identify their sexual orientation at young ages. Our findings do not support the contention that young people choose their identity or the timing of events in identity formation. Nor is there any evidence that the availability of GSAs influences those developmental processes.\"Remafedi's report was published in Pediatrics in 1992. The study explored patterns of sexual orientation in a representative sample of more than 34,000 Minnesota students in grades 7 to 12. PFOX, as well as Focus on the Family, distorted his findings to make the case that young people should not learn about homosexuality because they were sexually confused, and could thus be influenced by educational material.\n \n Last year, several researchers held Dobson accountable for misrepresenting their work. Letters and videos from these scientists can be viewed at www.RespectMyResearch.org.\n \n \"We thank Dr. Remafedi for stepping forward and not allowing his research to be manipulated for political gain,\" said Truth Wins Out Executive Director Wayne Besen. \"The right wing thrives on twisting legitimate research in its efforts to confuse people. We are doing everything in our power to stop this insidious practice.\"http://www.truthwinsout.org/pressreleases/minnesota-scientist-accuses-pfox-of-misrepresenting-his-research/\n \n I can't tell you how much of this type of thing I've seen over the years. \n Typically, those who are \"against\" homosexuality DO NOT do any real research themselves...\n They talk about OTHER people's research, and typically they aren't truthful when they do it either...",

   "Regina Griggs of PFOX (Parents and Friends of Ex-Gays) continues to tell whoppers. In this article at OneNewsNow she tells a huge lie:\n  \"Why are we allowing people to tell them, 'Try it -- you might like it?'

Slightly more than half would be female, so let's say conservatively that there are 22 million men between those ages. If 2% of them are MSM, that's 440,000.

Is a priest safe from civil litigation in such a case as that?\n\n \n I think priests are pretty safe from civil liability. No church makes a contract guaranteeing they will marry their members no matter what, and they are not obligated to marry non-members in any case -- you couldn't force a Catholic church to accommodate a Muslim wedding, for example. And no, I don't think you could launch a civil case against a priest who refused to sanctify a racially \"unacceptable\" marriage, either. Churches are exempt from laws pertaining to racial equality -- only government is bound by them.\n \n So yes, I suppose you could get a civil suit against a town clerk or justice of the peace who refused a civil ceremony in a state that allowed them, and if the clerk or JP happened also to be a clergyman, then he'd still be liable -- but not in his capacity as a cleric, but a civil official. But you couldn't force a priest to hold a marriage ceremony in his own church against his wishes or beliefs, no matter how repugnant they might be.\n \n Thank the first amendment for that.",
