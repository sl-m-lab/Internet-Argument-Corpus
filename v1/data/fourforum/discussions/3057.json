This weekend being an exception, but my partner is out of town.\n My son and I are performers and I am a director as well, for area Reniassance festivals and events. \n I'm either teaching Renaissance period dance or holding Period Costuming classes. My son is an accomplished musician with these events/faires. He plays several instruments and is one heck of a great \"stool ball\" player. (Stool ball is the predisesor to modern Cricket...comprised of two teams with only two players on each teams playing field.... such tournaments can last two days as the scoring goes up to 60 for tournament games.)\n \n I also do 'behind the scenes' work for my partner's Civil War Medical education team. (headed by her uncle) I do seamstress work for that period style as well as repairs on tents, cots, chairs or anything of fabric. I also am the sign maker for this group. (Mostly because I'm the one who owns the woodburning kit!) \n \n I'm fairly busy all the time. Just like any other 'thiry-something', suburban mom, my partner and I actually have to \"schedule\" alone time. But that's just how things go. Not all that titalating I'm afraid.",

   "[Hi Shake:\n \n QUOTE=Master_Shake]The point is, dimwit, that it is obvious to you and everyone else that she is gay and so is her girlfriend, therefore her legitimate question was, why did you bother to ask?\n \n \n Have you been inside Justine's mind again?\n\n \n \n AGAIN? When was he \"inside\" my head the first time, because I missed it. Hmmm...must not have left any kind of indelible mark.\n \n \n \n These are four very easy questions with only two possible answers for each.\n\n \n \n Easy for you to ask, but not so easy to answer because undoubtedly you have some comeback or retort as to my possible answers.\n \n \n She is big girl, and can answer for herself.\n\n \n I'm more that a \"big girl\" darlin, I'm a mother. I'm not your daughter, I'm not a bible student, I'm an adult woman. Until you stop with your degrading remarks to me or anyone else, your motives will always be suspect.\n \n \n Perhaps she does not care to answer, because you might not like her reply.\n\n \n Who exactly might not like my replies? \n Terral, I did answer your questions. Maybe not with the answers you wanted to hear, but those are my answers.\n \n \n How is it that Gay folks seem ready, willing and able to talk about their sexuality to complete strangers in these threads without reservation. Then, when someone comes along and asks them about it, they clam up and complain about attacks and arguments that simply do not exist?\n\n \n Did I complain? No\n Did I accuse you of attacking me? No\n \n What I did do was question your intent. I also asked as to your interest in my personal/private life. Insted of answering my fairly straight foreward questions you are the one who is complaining and accusing me of attacking you. \n That is a lie. You know it and it's fairly obvious to anyone else who can read. \n Yes, I asked my questions to you numerous times. But not without a valid concern. You had repeatedly ignored my posts on this thread  . \n \n Note, I said \"THIS THREAD\", I am not speaking of other threads here. Just one.\n It would be appreciated if for once you could actually stick to the subject at hand within the appropriate thread. \n \n \nIf her reply were as simple as you suggest, then she would have simply said so.\n\n \n Actually I did say so. I answered your questions. Now the ball is in your court and you are continuing to ignore my questions by your devisive changing of subject.\n \n \n No sir. This onion has many layers, and this is about much more than refusing to answer four very simple questions. \n \n Terral\n\n \n Well then, we are all waiting with baited breath for you to reveal those layers. \n Anytime you are ready to actually stick to the subject and answer my questions as I have asked them, I will be more than happy to respond. \n \n Until then, you really haven't any complaint.",

   "\n There you have it. That's my typical day. \n Not a lot of time for sleep let alone \"devient sexual behaviors.\"\n \n My non-typical days don't leave a whole lot of time for such things either.\n \n Kinda sounds like just about anyother stay-at-home/work-from-home mom doesn't it?\n\n We live in a fallen world and sin has distorted our perception of truth. Homosexuality is only one symptom of fallen humanity. In our brokenness of human nature, we have an undeniable inner craving to be whole. And yet, maybe it's because of our sinful nature that we (homosexuals and heterosexuals) seek wholeness in the wrong areas. \n \n Whether we're struggling with same-sex attractions, pornography, envy or lying, it's easy to want to slap a label of \"normal\" or \"healthy\" on ourselves to try to justify our sinful behaviors. But a label will never cover the deep wounds of people entangled in a life that is displeasing to God.",

It's you who is struggling with MY Sexuality.\n The fact that you or anyone else is so concerned troubles me. But not to the point where it takes over my life or makes me forget where my priorities lie.\n \n My family and their well being is, as it has always been, at the top of my priorities list. My having true equality, not dehumanizing descrimination, is part of that goal. Securing my equality equates to a better future for myself as well as my family. My child included. \n \n So pray for my soul while I continue my fight to secure the futures of my family and those like ours. Because I won't stop until it has become reality.",

I know that you have put a lot of energy into it as I've seen from your posts. It's very noble of you to worry as you claim not to have same-sex attractions yourself. Perhaps it's wisest to realize, you really don't have power over others and it's best to focus on enriching one's own life and allow others to develop without interference.\n \n I know that labels will never cover up the deep wounds of people entagled in a life that is displeasing to God, but if you really try hard to break free and find like-minded supportive people, I believe some healing can occur.\n \n Good luck to you.",
