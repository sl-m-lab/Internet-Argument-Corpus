   "I do, you do. Americans don't. They have put it into action when starting war preparations in Central Asia with China in view. Perhaps that was not their intent. Still China intensified its drive to militarily equip neighboring countries helping with them with getting nukes as well. As I get it Chinese want these countries as kind of buffer zone around China. The major chain is Iran facing American threat as well. Experts are sure that Iran really has got A-bomb. And they say there is Chinese brain behind it. Actually the story dates back to 90s, when China built a nuclear research reactor in Iran. Then it supplied centrifuge equipment to enrich uranium, which is abundant in Iran. Iranian nuclear engineers were educated in China. The recent news is that China supplied special gas to Iran to use it in uranium enrichment process. IAEA wasn't informed of the purchase though it should have been. The latest bitter revelations cane from military British experts working with the Jane's Defence Weekly. They point to the Beijing's close relationship with Iran in missile construction. Two new Chinese guided missiles TL-10 and TL-6 are absolutely identical to Iranian Nasr and Kosar. Really, China seems to have taken great interest in equipping Iran with A-bomb and other weaponry. It's simple. They just want Americans turn their eyes to Iran to leave China along for a while. This also explains lack of interest to talks on the Iranian side. I wonder how many else countries is going China to comprise in that buffer zone and how could this affect Americvan interests in the region?",
