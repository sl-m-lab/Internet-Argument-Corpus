They said: \n Canada is experiencing an even more severe shortage of doctors and nurses than most nations with a shortage.\n There is a huge waiting list for vital procedures. \n Assorted colorful remarks about Chretien and his party... \n \n And my French friend said in France it is first come, first served, which we all know isn't such a great idea.",

   "I have just spent 2 years in Canada and the health care sucks. But the reason is trivial: money.\n \n How many of you know the correct answer to the following question:\n Between Canada and the US, where does the government spend more on health care per capita?\n \n If you think it is Canada, you are dead wrong. And of course the private spending in the US is much bigger.\n \n The problem with the Canadian system is excessive cost control. This is because the politicians must keep taxes down - at any given election time, the majority of the voters are healthy.\n \n While no one likes high taxes, the US experience shows that people also hate cost control in health care. That is why we have - through legislation and litigation - crippled the HMOs' ability to control costs and we once again have a double-digit inflation in health care costs.\n \n But the truth is, the American 15% of GDP is probably closer to what an affluent society desires to spend on health care than Canada's 9%.",

In order to try to sway people into accepting some degree of privatization, the politicians make Health budgets which are completely impossible- because of pressure from huge US medical insurance companies.",
