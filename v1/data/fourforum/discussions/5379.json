   "Tonight is the last two episodes of \"24\". Jack Bauer will once again save America from the clutches of the dastardly terrorist \"Marwan\" who has launched a nuclear missile somewhere in the United States. President David Palmer has been brought back to help run the operation out of CTU and we all have our future in the hands of just one man (Jack Bauer) who must obtain the information to locate the cruise missile on its way to an unspecified city in America. Set your DVRs right now -- before you do another thing. It comes on at 7 PM Central Daylight time on Fox (Dish channel 8403). Two hours. Don't miss it. It will also provide a clue as to next year's episodes. \n \n Thought you would want to know. \n \n In the event you haven't seen this the first two seasons are now avaiable for rent at your local movie store. And the third season is available on DVD for sale. I purchased that at Wal-Mart and resold it on Amazon. Great entertainment. Will keep you on the edge of your seats. Very addictive.",

And do they subconsciously bring that to the voting booth?",

CAIR went ballistic and said that the series was picking on Muslim fanatics. So Fox backed off and some of the fanatics became \"good guys\" in the end.",
