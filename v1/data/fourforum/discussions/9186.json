   "Well, here you go, read this.....\n \n Fiji\n \n Transformed by the Gospel\n \"The President, Prime Minister and many top government officials on the Fiji Islands are people who want to seriously follow Christ and lead the nation's Church to turn around and dedicate the nation to God,\" reports Dr. Jack Dennison of CitiReach. Church leaders report that even members of the Military involved in the coup in the year 2000, now in prison, have become Christians and asked for forgiveness. \"In Suva, the capital, the prisoners' loud songs of worship can be heard on the street outside the jail, as they worship Jesus in a spirit of reconciliation and hope for the future of the nation,\" writes Dennison.\n Creation renewed\n One of the most astonishing aspects of the revival in Fiji is how God is renewing creation which man has destroyed. After decades of destruction, whole coral reefs are being revived, shoals of fish are returning to the island's waters and rivers, and crabs have been seen walking on the beaches for the first time in years. Even previously unfruitful trees are bearing fruit, and the vines are blossoming again.\n \"Ethnic cleansing\" results in literal bitterness\n \"I spent a whole day in the highlands around Niku, together with George Otis, Kevin Palau of the Palau Evangelistic Association and Ken Eldred, founder of the Living Stones Foundation, because Otis wanted to film 'The miracle of the bitter water',\" Dennison continues. \"Our guide was pastor Vuniani 'Vuni' Nakauyaca, who grew up in Niku. He told us how the village chief started a war with the neighbouring villages, driving all members of tribes other than his own out of the village. Death, desperation and fear filled the valley. While Vuni was playing in the 5 feet wide and 2 feet deep stream flowing through the village, the water suddenly turned dark and bitter. Anyone who drank from the stream could be blinded or go mad, he remembers. The government tested the water, and found arsenic, asphalt and other poisonous substances.\n The miracle of the bitter water\n \"During a conference in Toowoomba, Australia, Vuni heard about the concept of city reaching through reconciliation, national repentance and healing (2. Chr. 7:14). On returning home, he called on the present leaders and chiefs to repent. They responded, seeking forgiveness for their fathers' sins in a month-long process of prayer, fasting and reconciliation. Relationships were renewed, and whole villages, including many nominal Christians, dedicated themselves to seriously following Christ. Speaking with some village elders, we discovered that several of the women in the village were very surprised when the water suddenly became crystal clear again a month before our visit. One brave villager volunteered to taste the water. It was drinkable again! The water had been undrinkable for 40 years, and the villagers' joy about God's intervention knew no boundaries. Today, people in the village meet every day to study the Bible and pray together. One woman told the whole village that grass is starting to grow on the banks of the stream again, the flowers are blossoming, small fish have returned and vegetables grow faster and larger than even the previous month.\"\n The 2nd Chronicles 2:14 principle\n \"I think God takes repentance and reconciliation, as described in 2nd Chronicles, very seriously,\" says Dennison. \"He really does send blessing 'where brothers live together in unity'. The events in Fiji are one of the clearest signs of God's pleasure and reaction to societal repentance that I have ever seen.\" writes Dennison.\n \n Source: Dr. Jack Dennison, fax (+1)- 719-548.9619; e-mail: JackD@CitiReach.org, www.CitiReach.org",
