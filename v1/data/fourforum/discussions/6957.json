   "I want to go back and take a look again at the \"militia clause\" of the Second Amendment. It is, after all, the focal point for gun control supporters who seek to limit the individual RKBA: \n \n \"A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state.\" \n \n I have argued before that the militia clause was never intended to limit the RKBA; rather, it was intended to express the opinion that standing armies ought to be avoided whenever possible, and that the best method of preventing government oppression was to rely on a militia composed of ordinary citizens. I came to this conclusion by asking myself this question: \n \n Why did Madison use the term \"free\" state? \n \n In looking at this I reached the conclusion that Madison is making a public policy statement for how to avoid the public ever fearing the ambitions of a tyrant who controls the standing army. In fact, it looks to me like he read this same public policy goal in the state constitutions, and he merely \"cut and pasted\" it into the Second Amendment. Here is a sample of state constitutional \"militia clauses\" he would have been exposed to (in chronological order of adoption):\n \n CONSTITUTION OF VIRGINIA (June 6, 1776)\n \n That a well-regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, trained to arms, is the proper, natural, and safe defense of a free state; that standing armies, in time of peace, should be avoided, as dangerous to liberty; and that in all cases the military should be under strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil power.\n \n CONSTITUTION OF PENNSYLVANIA (August 16, 1776)\n \n That the people have a right to bear arms for the defense of themselves and the state; And as standing armies in the time of peace are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be kept up; And that the military should be kept under strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil power.\n \n DELAWARE DECLARATION OF RIGHTS (September 11, 1776)\n \n That a well-regulated militia is the proper, natural and safe defense of a free government.\n \n That standing armies are dangerous to liberty, and ought not to be raised or kept up without the consent of the legislature.\n \n CONSTITUTION OF MARYLAND (November 3, 1776)\n \n That a well-regulated militia is the proper and natural defense of a free government.\n \n That standing armies are dangerous to liberty, and ought not to be raised or kept up, without consent of the legislature.\n \n CONSTITUTION OF NORTH CAROLINA (December 14, 1776)\n \n That the people have a right to bear arms, for the defense of the State; and, as standing armies, in time of peace, are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be kept up; and that the military should be kept under strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil power.\n \n CONSTITUTION OF VERMONT (July 8, 1777)\n \n That the people have a right to bear arms for the defense of themselves and the State; and, as standing armies, in time of peace, are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be kept up; and that the military should be kept under strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil power.\n \n CONSTITUTION OF MASSACHUSETTS (October 25, 1780)\n \n The people have a right to keep and bear arms for the common defense. And as, in time of peace, armies are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be maintained without the consent of the legislature, and the military power shall always be held in exact subordination to the civil authority, and be governed by it.\n \n CONSTITUTION OF NEW HAMPSHIRE (June 2, 1784)\n \n A well-regulated militia is the proper, natural, and safe defense of a state.\n \n Standing armies are dangerous to liberty, and ought not to be raised or kept up without the consent of the legislature.\n \n You can see from these provisions that the reliance on a \"well regulated militia\" as opposed to a standing army was included in the state constitutions as an important public policy goal. This goal was also expressed repeatedly in the constitutional debates:\n \n \"Is it necessary for your liberty, that you should abandon those great rights by the adoption of this system?. . . Will the abandonment of your most sacred rights tend to the security of your liberty?. . . .I am fearful I have lived long enough to become an old fashioned fellow: Perhaps an invincible attachment to the dearest rights of man, may, in these refined enlightened days, be deemed old fashioned: If so, I am contented to be so. . . . Guard with jealous attention the public liberty. Suspect everyone who approaches that jewel. Unfortunately, nothing will preserve it, but downright force: Whenever you give up that force, you are inevitably ruined. . . .\n \n My great objection to this Government is, that it does not leave us the means of defending our rights; or, of waging war against tyrants. . . .\n \n The Honorable Gentleman who presides, told us, that to prevent abuses in our Government, we will assemble in Convention, recall our delegated powers, and punish our servants for abusing the trust reposed in them. Oh, Sir, we should have fine times indeed, if to punish tyrants, it were only sufficient to assemble the people. Your arms wherewith you could defend yourselves, are gone. . . . Did you ever read of any revolution in any nation, brought about by the punishment of those in power, inflicted by those who had no power at all? You read of a riot act in a country [England] which is called one of the freest in the world, where a few neighbors cannot assemble without the risk of being shot by hired soldiery, the engines of despotism. We may see such an act in America. A standing army we shall have also, to execute the execrable commands of tyranny: And how are you to punish them? Will you order them to be punished? Who shall obey these orders? Will your Mace-bearer be a match for a disciplined regiment? In what situation are we to be? . . . .What resistance could be made? The attempt would be madness.\" Patrick Henry, Speeches of June 5 and 7, 1788, before the Virginia Ratifying Convention, reprinted in The Anti-Federalist Papers and the Constitutional Convention Debates, pages 199-216, Mentor Books, 1986, edited by Ralph Ketchum. \n \n \"It has been asserted by the most respectable writers upon government, that a well-regulated militia, composed of the yeomanry of the country, have ever been considered as the bulwark of a free people. Tyrants have never placed any confidence on a militia composed of freemen.\" John DeWitt, The Anti-Federalist Papers, p. 75 (M. Borden ed. 1965)\n \n \"The power of the sword, say the minority of Pennsylvania, is in the hands of Congress. My friends and countrymen, it is not so, for the powers of the sword are in the hands of the yeomanry of America from sixteen to sixty. The militia of these free commonwealths, entitled and accustomed to their arms, when compared with any possible army, must be tremendous and irresistible. Who are the militia? Are they not ourselves? Is it feared, then, that we shall turn our arms each man against his own bosom? Congress shall have no power to disarm the militia. Their swords and every other terrible implement of the soldier, are the birth-right of an American ....[T]he unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or the state governments, but where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the People.\" Tench Coxe, Pennsylvania Gazette, Feb. 20, 1788.\n \n \"Little more can reasonably be aimed at with respect to the people at large than to have them properly armed and equipped. . . .This will not only lessen the call for military establishments, but if circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large body of citizens, little if any inferior to them in discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their rights and those of their fellow citizens.\" Alexander Hamilton, The Federalist Papers #29, reprinted at page 185 in The Federalist Papers, Mentor Books, 1969, edited by Clinton Rossiter.\n \n \"Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed; as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States. A military force, at the command of Congress, can execute no laws, but such as the people perceive to be just and constitutional; for they will possess the power, and jealousy will instantly inspire the inclination, to resist the execution of a law which appears to them unjust and oppressive.\" Noah Webster, \"An Examination into the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution\" (1787) in Pamphlets on the Constitution of the United States (P. Ford, 1888).\n \n \"Whenever, therefore, the profession of arms becomes a distinct order in the state. . .the end of the social compact is defeated. . . .No free government was ever founded, or ever preserved its liberty, without uniting the characters of the citizen and soldier in those destined for defense of the state. . . .Such a well regulated militia, composed of freeholders, citizens and husbandman, who take up arms to preserve their property, as individuals, and their rights as freemen.\" M. T. Cicero (a pseudonym), Charleston State Gazette, September 8, 1788.\n \n \"A militia, when properly formed, are in fact the people themselves, and render regular troops in a great measure unnecessary. . . .the constitution ought to secure a genuine and guard against a select militia. . .and include. . .all men capable of bearing arms. . . . But, say gentlemen, the general militia are for the most part employed at home in their private concerns, cannot well be called out, or be depended upon; that we must have a select militia. . . .[of the select militia] These Corps, not much unlike regular troops, well ever produce an inattention to the general militia. . .whereas, to preserve liberty, it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms, and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use them. . . .The mind that aims at a select militia, must be influenced by a truly anti-republican principle; and when we see many men disposed to practice upon it, whenever they can prevail, no wonder true republicans are for carefully guarding against it.\" Richard Henry Lee, Additional Letters from the Federal Farmer, p. 169-170 (1788)\n \n Now public policy statements like the state constitutional \"militia clauses\" were nothing new to Madison, and they were in fact not limited only to the RKBA. Consider, for example, the Constitution of Virginia once again, this time regarding the freedoms of press and religion:\n \n \"That the freedom of the press is one of the great bulwarks of liberty, and can never be restrained but by despotic governments.\"\n \n \"That religion or the duty which we owe to our Creator, and the manner of discharging it, can be directed only by reason and conviction, not by force or violence; and, therefore, all men are equally entitled to the free exercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience....\"\n \n In both of these provisions you see the use of policy statements which precede the substantive right, and in neither case do you find any credible argument that the policy preamble somehow limits the substantive right. I believe the same is true for the Second Amendment.\n \n In my opinion, the language \"[a] well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a FREE state\" was never intended by our founding fathers to limit the right of the people to keep and bear private arms. Rather, it is merely a preamble o the RKBA which states the universally held principle that \"standing armies, in time of peace, should be avoided, as dangerous to liberty.\" Tench Coxe, who helped Madison campaign for the ratification of his BoR, described the Second Amendment similarly: \n \n \"As civil rulers, not having their duty to the people duly before them, may attempt to tyrannize, and as the military forces which must be occasionally raised to defend our country, might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow citizens, the people are confirmed by the article in their right to keep and bear private arms.\" Tench Coxe, Remarks on the First Part of the Amendments to the Federal Constitution. Published under the pseudonym, \"A Pennsylvanian\" in the Philadelphia Federal Gazette, June 18, 1789 at 2 Col. 1 \n \n There is, in my opinion, no credible argument for divorcing the militia clause from its roots and using it instead as a rope to tie up and restrict the individual RKBA.\n \n Why then is the \"militia clause\" included in the 2nd. Amendment with the RKBA? I think it was for the reason mentioned in the case incorrectly cited most often as supporting the position that there is no individual right to keep and bear arms--U.S. v. Miller:\n \n \"The signification attributed to the term Militia appears from the debates in the Convention, the history and legislation of the Colonies and the States, and the writings of approved commentators. These show plainly enough that the militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. \"A body of citizens enrolled for military discipline.\" And further, that ordinarily when called for service these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of a kind in common use at the time.\" United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174, 179 (1939).\n \n The militias of the time were comprised primarily of citizens bearing their private arms-hence the natural inclusion of the militia preamble within the amendment which also protects the individual right to keep and bear arms. \n \n Now the temptation arises for gun control supporters to say: \"well then, this must be the purpose of the RKBA after all, and since we no longer rely on privately held arms to equip the state militias, then we really don't need the right to keep and bear arms anymore.\" \n \n There are any number of responses to this argument, but I respond as follows:\n \n First, do not ignore what Noah Webster and Tench Coxe said about the individual RKBA as quoted above, and go back to read Miller again. You will find this: \"If the citizens have these arms in their hands, they are prepared in the best possible manner to repel any encroachments upon their rights....\" Miller at p. 178, citing Aymette v. State, 2 Hump. (21 Tenn.) 154, 158 (1840).\n \n Second, consider the practical effect of such an argument. Everyone agrees the first ten amendments to the Constitution were enacted to restrict the ability of our national government to \"overleap the bounds\" of its authority and power. The Second Amendment's guarantee of the people's right to keep and bear arms provides a direct check on the ability of the government to engage in mischief against its citizens. As others have said before, it was included as one of the first ten amendments to provide a check against the government's attempts to take away the other nine.\n \n Are we now to suggest that our government can be permitted to unilaterally abolish a check on its power by creating a circumstance which allows it to claim that the check is not only dangerous to society but also no longer needed--that it can simply \"cut and paste\" an Amendment out of the Constitution? If this argument is accepted at face value, then are not all the rights contained in the Bill of Rights placed in doubt? If you argue, as the Brady Campaign does, that the right to keep and bear arms is \"anachronistic\" and should be abolished, then are you ready to have the same argument used against you by those who would have us believe that in the age of global terror the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures is also anachronistic? In the final analysis, I believe that such short-sighted attacks on the right to keep and bear arms serve ultimately to encourage assaults upon the other rights our Constitution also recognizes and protects.\n \n --- \n \n \"The great ideals of liberty and equality are preserved against the assaults of opportunism, the expediency of the passing hour, the erosion of small encroachments, the scorn and derision of those who have no patience with general principles, by enshrining them in constitutions, and consecrating to the task of their protection a body of defenders.\" Justice Benjamin Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process, New haven, 1921.\n \n \"Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the Government's purposes are beneficent. Men born to freedom are naturally alert to repel invasion of their liberty by evil-minded rulers. The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding.\" Justice Brandeis, Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 485 (1928) (dissenting opinion).",
