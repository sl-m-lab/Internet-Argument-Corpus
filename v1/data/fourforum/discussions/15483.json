   "What bankruptcy do you speak of? Are you complaining about the widespread financial bailouts that were given to corrupt organizations that proved incapable of managing their own money? The sinking of the American economy by borrowing trillions of dollars from foreign nations that we can never repay? The country's inability to remain functioning without sinking further into debt and prostituting itself in the process?\n \n Or instead of these legitimate positions regarding the true bankruptcy of the nation, are you rather launching baseless attacks regarding opponents of Obama and his policies? In which case this is the wrong thread to be discussing the current economic meltdown the country is faced with.\n \n The constitution protects dissenting opinions, disagreements with government policy, and the people calling for the current president or congress to be impeached and recalled due to incompetence and idiocy.\n \n Can you substantiate your claims of republicans being traitors who need to be tried for their supposed crimes? If so then why have you not presented the needed evidence to establish your position and legitimize your claims?",

   "Then perhaps you should attempt to explain your accusations of treason being directed against the republican party and how they're supposedly responsible for the economic mess the country is currently in. \n \n The last time I checked it was Obama and his democrat oriented administration that was proposing new taxes. It was the democratic party that gave bailout money to giant corporations while leaving the average people with nothing. I see no justification for laying blame at the feet of the republicans unless you can back up your claims.\n \n Furthermore the claim of \"a media controlled by the industrial military complex\" seems entirely out of place in this discussion, serving no role other than that of a diversionary tactic.",

Now the GOP/Teabag association is willing to turn down 4 trillion dollars in Spending Cuts and risk taking the Nation into Default all to protect the Top 1 % whom they claim are \" job Creators\" but so far they have created NO JOBS.... Obama continued spending more, and with Revenues at the lowest point in history we have no money to pay the bills so our debt increases . The GOP and teabaggers are holding America Hostage trying to push their anti Obama agenda.. I think calling them traitors is an under statement.",
