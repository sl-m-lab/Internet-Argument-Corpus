   "Here's something for y'all. I'm not sure how accurate these claims are, but they at least will keep this debate going. :D \n \n For ballistic 'fingerprinting' to work as proposed, all of the following assumptions must materialize: \n \n That the firearm barrel and firing pin have not been modified, replaced, deformed from normal use, or intentionally falsified with new ballistic markings. \n \n That all 200 million firearms lawfully possessed by Americans are brought into labs and fired to gather individual ballistic 'fingerprinting.' \n \n That all violent criminals, and people who might become one, also bring in their firearms for 'fingerprinting.' \n \n That all ballistic 'fingerprinting' files are stored in a national database. \n \n That an expended bullet or shell casing be recovered from a crime scene. \n \n That the bullet or shell casing conclusively match the ballistic 'fingerprinting' of a firearm owned by a person stored in the database. \n \n That the firearm has not been sold, transferred, stolen or gifted to another person. \n \n That the person, now a criminal suspect, still possess that firearm at a current address. \n \n Police criminalists and forensic scientists have studied such a system and called it 'impractical' [California Department of Justice, Bureau of Forensic Services].\n {Excerpt from Bush, NRA Differ on Gun 'Fingerprinting', found at NewsMax.com} \n \n \n \n This info is found at: http://www.handguncontrolinc.org/noful3.htm\n \n (WARNING: This site is a parody.)",
