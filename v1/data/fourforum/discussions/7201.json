   "Cut and paste this into an email and send it to everyone you know!\n \n Stephen Bennett Ministries, along with its radio program \"Straight Talk Radio\" have called gay unions a stench in god's nostrils. He has advised parents of gay children to not allow them to bring their partners home for holiday dinner. He has compared gays to alcoholics and drug users, and claims gays can be cured. These claims defy every mainstream psychological and medical association in the world.\n \n He claims he lived for 11 years as a homosexual. He tells people that he has the inside scoop on being gay, now that he is \"ex-gay\" and married to a woman. His radio program has featured topics such as, \"The Medical Dangers of Homosexuality\" or \"A heart for the Homosexual\". His shows have painted an image that gays are child predators, drug addicts, sexual maniacs, all bound to die of AIDS. He uses the bible to back up his hateful messages and claims he is protecting children.\n \n He thinks in his mind that he is helping people, but reality is he is hurting more people than he helps. He needs to know who it is he hurts with this message.I urge you to join with me in speaking out against these words of violence. Sign the Stop Stephen Bennett petition today, Let him know that you don't approve of words being used as violence against gays and lesbians or their families. Be sure to be nice in your comments.
