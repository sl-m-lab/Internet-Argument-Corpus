   "I've been told that one of the problems the west faces in its middle east diplomacy/meddling (delete as appropriate) is that Islam has a strong concept of brotherhood that makes the bond between fellow muslims generally stronger than those of the same nationalities (especially given the religious divides in the middle eastern countries). When this was first mentioned the first thing it brought to mind was Communism and various Internationales which didn't quite achieve what they set out to originally.\n \n However the whole free Iraq/Iran has made me question this, that and the scale of things are different (the west capatilistic world was further spread due to the US, Western Europe and the British Empire and didn't really experience the revolutions the internationals hoped for, at least to the same degree). Nothing seems to unify a people like an apparent common threat, and its not hard to imagine that the west in the former of the US and EU as well as the USSR in its time have certainly seemed to present this to a certain degree.\n \n Basicilly, other than making new editions of Risk easier to develop do you think that this tendancy to form larger groups of nations works in our favour or makes things more dangerous. \n \n To me, whilst initially the unification of the Arab/Islamic (depending which emerges on top, Iran and Iraq are Islamic over Arabic arn't they?) makes it harder for the west and others to directly influence the various member states, surely once communication is established on a greater international level between the various countries it will certainly make it easier for western cultural memes to penetrate the area and build up strength (which is the only way we'll get what we want out of the middle east, by essentially making them us).\n \n So yeah, you think the unification of a Islamic/Arabic Union would cause more harm than good in the world (especially if they can play more of a big brother role to the African Union), or is this only going to end in tears due to being imperialism and colonialism reformatted for the 21st century?",
