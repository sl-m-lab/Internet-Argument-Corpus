   "Since there seems to be a large number of anti-Christian threads, I'm wondering how many \"anti-Christians\" post regularly to 4Forums.\n\n There are a few \"bashers\" who make unreasoned attacks on Christianity in the religion threads. Usually, these offensives are directed against the so-called \"fundies\". This probably reflects an American worry that religious militancy (real or perceived) threatens the secular state. \n \n Most sceptics and atheists are content to engage in reasoned debate with their religious opponents - not caring much whether the religion under scrutiny is Christianity or some other established superstition. There should be no embargo on discussing Islam, for instance, as a religious delusion that does more harm than good.",

   "Good post, JP. \n I think it's going to be very hard to convince anyone of the meaning of faith, whether it is in God or man, machines or medicine. First a person has to realize that faith exists and, therefore, can recognize it for what it is. Having faith in something is dependant on the person. Having the faith of someone is altogether different. Before we can have the faith of God, for instance, we must at least know of God...period. That's what sets our invisible ways of life apart from the natural world. There are only a handful of folks that I know who have made that trip. I'm not there yet, but am trying and have experienced the pitfalls they have overcome. If someone has ever made that trip they would not be so hasty at judgment like we see from the televangelists or the Bible-thumpers. Still, there's no way to prove that particular faith gained through trial and tribulation and so the road goes on and on; the insults mount, the God-haters hate, etc. etc., until no matter who or what we are we are lumped into the same pile as those we withstand.\n \n I've also noticed that the persons who bash Christians are not that far from condemning themselves, for if they only knew who it was they were criticizing they wouldn't dare attempt it. Getting them to realize even this small thing, though, is a major obstacle.\n \n \nFaith in God, however, is based on the fact that the believer has been sufficiently influenced, by culture and/or upbringing and/or the lack/loss of something important in life which needs replacing, to have a belief in something of which they have no experience and have never observed.\n\n For some folks, but not for those that have experienced God personally.

That's why I posted on Alan's thread (http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=6861) what Christ said about a person being called by God. Religionists conveniently forget about this passage of scripture and set out to do God's work for Him - or give the impression that's what they're doing. I know it seems like I'm against organized religion, which I am not, but I am opposed to plain old, everyday folks  that take the Bible and twist it to fit their belief system. These are extremists of the most dangerous kind, imo. However, there's no difference in them than those who push a belief system to the extreme, such as homosexual extremists that think just because they believe in what they are doing so should everyone else. (Now that's a growing religion that even they should get a handle on) Or like political extremists (far right/far left) who are always pushing some agenda \"for the good of the people\"...yea - right.\n \nI'm not pointing a finger at you, Orn. You've always been careful to seperate what you believe from what could be considered obviously true to everyone. But there are many on this board, and in the world at large, who expect, demand even, that others run their lives based on experiences that they haven't had, and are in fact contrary to what they have experienced.\n\n Thanks, and I agree. As I have stated above - it's not just Christians, though.\n \n If God has spoken with you than you are indeed fortunate, and I can well understand how such an experience would profoundly effect your life. That's never happened to me. No event in the entirety of my life has given me the slightest reason to suspect the existence of a divine being. Just as I respect that you've had some experience which has had a strong effect on your life, I would call on people to understand that no such event has happened to me, or in fact to most people. I have no reference point by which I can understand what has happened to you, so don't expect me to change the way I live my life based on your experience. No matter how sure you are that God wants such and such, I have no reason to believe you. Have all the faith you want, but don't ask me to share it or live by it.\n\n I did not come to this forum to \"spread my variety of faith\", but to hopefully help at least one person understand it. There have been times when I had to take a break due to the hate and indifference, but that was expected. No, I was not always a Christian and I do understand where you're coming from, Kronus. I have said this many times here - I have no illusions of grandeur about bringing the lost to Christ because I try my best to do as the Gospel teaches, which states that no one can come to Christ unless that person is called. So try as I might I can't call them...whether it be with emotions or testimony.",

Y. L. Fung has written that whereas western people are religious in outlook, the Chinese are philosophical. At least a part of this controversy is a quibble over words. If religion is defined in western monotheistic terms, then clearly the word has little or no reference to China. Indeed, there is no word in the Chinese language accurately translatable as \"religion.\" In modern times the Chinese character chiao has been co-opted for the purpose, but the original meaning of this term is \"teaching\". However, if religion is defined more generally, as proposed in Chapter 1, as an existent system of holy forms, then clearly the Chinese tradition does show observable phenomena which fit this definition. Heaven, Earth, the Central Kingdom, and Man constitute such a system of holy forms - withal a distinctively Chinese system.\n (bold emphasis added, Paths of Faith: Fourth Edition, Johan A. Hutchinson, McGraw Hill, 1991, p214) \n\n \n So anyone who was aware of this issue - which you seem not to be, but I am - would have hesitated/resisted interpreting my statement the way you did.\n \n \n So, Obvious Child:\n \n 1) You stuffed a word into my statements - AGAIN!!! Nowhere is the word Confucianism found in MY original statements.\n \n 2) You incorrectly isolated my two sentences from the preceding and following contexts, which make my intent clear, in order to impose YOUR desired MISinterpretation onto them.\n \n 3) You ignored the fact that your mangled version of my original statement doesn't make sense, since Confucianism - a word I didn't you, but that you stuffed into my statements - IS considered a religion by many. So your forced interpretation forces my statements into contradictions, when there are none originally.\n \n Do you ever get tired of being dishonest? :xbanghead \n ",

   "Sorry for the delay in replying.\n \n \nThat's one of the most distorted views of religion that I've ever read. Nothing inherently good about it?! Have you ever read the Bible? The 10 Commandments? It's full of positive examples of behavior, moral teachings that act as a guide for the person to live in society. Ever hear of the Golden Rule? \"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you\"? Doesn't this sound like a \"good\" philosophy to live by, even if you get nothing more from religion?emoticon_confused\n \n \n You'll note that in my opening paragraph I was discussing faith, not religion, and certainly not any specific religion. Before one can subscribe to any religion, one must implicitly accept that belief for its own sake is a good thing. Thus: faith is first and foremost a belief that belief is good - or, if you prefer, an unfounded but unshakeable conviction that holding unfounded, unshakeable convictions is good.\n \n Upon this foundation religion can build any edifice it likes. It can teach that murder is bad, or that you should be loving and giving to your fellow man, or that you should respect your elders. Equally it can teach that homosexuality is a sin, or that the flesh of pigs is unclean, or that women must wear costumes from The Mummy Returns when in public. It can teach anything, because its students are already willing and eager to hold beliefs with no rational basis.\n \n \nInteresting analogy, especially since spirituality is one of the most effective means of ending addictions. emoticon_wow\n\n \n You can wean addicts off heroin by giving them methadone, too; are you sure you want to take the discussion in that direction? I find it entirely unsurprising that religion can be an effective substitute for chemical methods of withdrawing from the real world.\n \n \nSo, you are saying that the sense of community found in Church exploits this need? emoticon_confused\n\n \n No. I'm saying that religion exploits that need by first offering a sense of community and then threatening to take it away again unless followers adopt particular stances on issues that might never have occurred to them otherwise. I used the christian/gay issue as an example. By the time a young christian becomes aware of the issue and is ready to make an informed choice, he has already been locked into an anti-gay stance. He or she must toe the line or face the condemnation of all those he loves and respects.\n \n \nSo, the sense of security that many feel by being part of a religion isn't a good thing?\n\n \n As I've said, it really depends how each religion wields the threat of losing that security. No religion is unconditional; conditions are the raison d'etre of religion.\n \n For instance, would it really be so bad if EasyRider's christianity was exactly the same except that it was also OK to be gay? Would ER feel any less secure for being a part of that religion? Of course not. There's no rational basis for the anti-gay rules he defends so vigorously. But them's the rules.\n \n It would clearly be wrong to equate christianity with, say, white supremacist movements, but it's important to recognise that the means by which they - and all belief systems - attract and retain adherants are exactly similar: indoctrination by respected peers and elders; a sense of belonging to something greater than oneself; the ever-present threat of the loss of community as a punishment for transgressions.\n \n It is this across-the-board congruence that underpins my assertion that faith is at best value-neutral, and that - in practice - human weakness, ignorance, arrogance and prejudice makes it on balance a negative force.\n \n \nWe should all run around as selfish paranoid individuals, without direction or purpose, winging it along the way ?\n\n \n Sure, because that's the only alternative...\n \n \nNo thanks. My religion gives me direction. It helps me gain the ability to put things in my life in their proper perspective. As a husband and father of threee I see that as a good thing.\n If you don't, then I feel sorry for you, but that's your choice.\n\n \n It's Ok, you don't need to feel sorry for me. I'm happy with my direction and the perspective I have on life, which I don't mind saying seems considerably clearer than many. As a husband and father of - well, nobody yet, but I'm working on it - I thank myself every day for not needing a big beard in the sky to keep me happy :)",

   "Sorry for the delay in replying. \n \n You'll note that in my opening paragraph I was discussing faith, not religion, and certainly not any specific religion. Before one can subscribe to any religion, one must implicitly accept that belief for its own sake is a good thing. Thus: faith is first and foremost a belief that belief is good - or, if you prefer, an unfounded but unshakeable conviction that holding unfounded, unshakeable convictions is good.\n\n My error. You were, indeed, referring to \"faith\" not one's \"Faith\". Never-the-less, I would argue that faith isn't the sole domain of the religious. As was pointed out before, it takes faith in order to get on an airplane the first time. Unless you've studied aerodynamics, inspected the engines and reviewed the pilot's credentials, you're flying on faith. When a small child gets on a plane, he/she has faith that his/her parents wouldn't put them in harm's way. So, my point is that faith is, at least,somewhat inate.\n \n\n Upon this foundation religion can build any edifice it likes. It can teach that murder is bad, or that you should be loving and giving to your fellow man, or that you should respect your elders. Equally it can teach that homosexuality is a sin, or that the flesh of pigs is unclean, or that women must wear costumes from The Mummy Returns when in public. It can teach anything, because its students are already willing and eager to hold beliefs with no rational basis.\n\n I think that you're taking a too simplistic view of faith. I can't speak for others, but my faith is always tempered by my experiences, environment and just plain common sense. I'm not sure that most people would buy Jim Jone's preaching hook line and Koolaid, for example. \n \n\n You can wean addicts off heroin by giving them methadone, too; are you sure you want to take the discussion in that direction? I find it entirely unsurprising that religion can be an effective substitute for chemical methods of withdrawing from the real world.\n\n Methadone just transfers an addiction to an illegal drug to a legal one. It isn't a cure. In fact, methadone addiction is one of the toughest to kick, harder than heroin.\n Religion has been demonstrated to cure addiction.\n \n\n No. I'm saying that religion exploits that need by first offering a sense of community and then threatening to take it away again unless followers adopt particular stances on issues that might never have occurred to them otherwise. I used the christian/gay issue as an example. By the time a young christian becomes aware of the issue and is ready to make an informed choice, he has already been locked into an anti-gay stance. He or she must toe the line or face the condemnation of all those he loves and respects.\n \n\n In my 49 years of life, I've never heard a priest preach about homosexuality. I certainly never heard a Catholic priest ever threaten to excommunicate or ostricize anyone who was gay. The condemnation that you speak of is foreign to my personal experiences. I can't say that other religions don't, though.\n \n\n As I've said, it really depends how each religion wields the threat of losing that security. No religion is unconditional; conditions are the raison d'etre of religion.\n \n For instance, would it really be so bad if EasyRider's christianity was exactly the same except that it was also OK to be gay? Would ER feel any less secure for being a part of that religion? Of course not. There's no rational basis for the anti-gay rules he defends so vigorously. But them's the rules.\n\n For someone who adheres to the Bible strictly, their religion would be fundamentally altered if suddenly it was \"OK\" to be gay. That would require the rejection of the portions of the Bible that teach against it.\n \n\n It would clearly be wrong to equate christianity with, say, white supremacist movements, but it's important to recognise that the means by which they - and all belief systems - attract and retain adherants are exactly similar: indoctrination by respected peers and elders; a sense of belonging to something greater than oneself; the ever-present threat of the loss of community as a punishment for transgressions.\n\n What you describe isn't the sole purview of religion. It is a characteristic of mankind. I could use the same argument for why people join fraternities, sports teams and almost any secular organization.\n \n\n It is this across-the-board congruence that underpins my assertion that faith is at best value-neutral, and that - in practice - human weakness, ignorance, arrogance and prejudice makes it on balance a negative force.\n\n And I argue that faith is a natural human characteristic and as such can be used for either good or bad purposes. It can feed on human weakness or strengthen human resolve to act humanely. I would argue that, at worst, it's value neutral and at it's best it encourages and rewards altruism and other noble endeavors.\n \n\n Sure, because that's the only alternative...\n \n\n Sad\n \n\n It's Ok, you don't need to feel sorry for me. I'm happy with my direction and the perspective I have on life, which I don't mind saying seems considerably clearer than many. As a husband and father of - well, nobody yet, but I'm working on it - I thank myself every day for not needing a big beard in the sky to keep me happy :)\n\n \n I don't \"need\" Him to keep me happy either, but I bet I sleep better than you at night. :) \n Good luck on your impending fatherhood. Perhaps being a parent will be an epiphany for you. emoticon_xangel",

   "As was pointed out before, it takes faith in order to get on an airplane the first time. Unless you've studied aerodynamics, inspected the engines and reviewed the pilot's credentials, you're flying on faith. When a small child gets on a plane, he/she has faith that his/her parents wouldn't put them in harm's way. So, my point is that faith is, at least,somewhat inate.\n\n \n The ability and inclination to learn to trust other people is unquestionably innate. It's the foundation of our success as a species. However, I think you're using faith in too general a sense here - or to put it another way, you're using the word 'faith' to describe concepts more accurately characterised in other ways.\n \n Faith is an active, conscious belief that things are one way rather than another. It is quite different from being rationally satisfied that things are one way rather than another, and both are quite different from it simply never occurring to you to think there might be an alternative.\n \n Take your 'small child' example. If, as you say, a child will get on a plane because he trusts his parents, why won't he eat new foods the first time they offer it to him? Doesn't he trust his mum and dad to only give him good things to eat? \n \n In truth, a child will only hop happily onto a plane with mum and dad (and he won't always do that, as anyone flying cattle-class will attest) because he has little concept of what's about to happen and it never occurs to him to think anything could go wrong anyway.\n \n You try sitting down and explaining to a child just how high they're going, all the things that have to work perfectly, and the plummet to certain death that will occur if they don't, and then try getting them on a plane with you. Try the same the first time they go to the dentist: \"If he's a bad dentist or makes a mistake, this is going to hurt more than you could possibly imagine, and might even paralyse your face so you can't smile anymore. That happens sometimes. But I know he's a good dentist and I'm sure that won't happen\".\n \n A child's trust is largely the inability to conceive of alternatives.\n \n Now, as we get older and start to be able to extrapolate consequences, we begin to rely more and more on judgement to convince us. Still, it's possible to get on a plane without thinking anything of it, even as an adult; it's no longer the technological novelty it once was, and there are fewer and fewer people around to tell us 'ooh, you'd never get me in one of those things'. \n \n But if we do think about it, it's reason that assuages our doubts. People fly all over the world all the time; ok, it goes wrong sometimes, but not often. We are reassured to be told that flying is statistically safer than driving a car. Adults who harbour a fear of flying refuse to get on a plane because their reason is insufficiently powerful to overcome their irrational belief that the plane is going to crash.\n \n \nI think that you're taking a too simplistic view of faith. I can't speak for others, but my faith is always tempered by my experiences, environment and just plain common sense. I'm not sure that most people would buy Jim Jone's preaching hook line and Koolaid, for example.\n\n \n Evidently not, but plenty do. You mention your faith being 'tempered' - I'll get to that in more detail below. \n \n \nMethadone just transfers an addiction to an illegal drug to a legal one. Religion has been demonstrated to cure addiction.\n\n \n My argument is that, for them, religion is just another transference of addiction. I'd be willing to bet they aren't 'a little bit' religious afterwards :)\n \n Understand that I'm not saying I'd prefer them to remain on heroin. But I'm very much opposed, on moral grounds, to making such people vulnerable to beliefs that are unrelated to their rehabilitation. Religion generally comes as a package deal.\n \n \nIn my 49 years of life, I've never heard a priest preach about homosexuality. I certainly never heard a Catholic priest ever threaten to excommunicate or ostricize anyone who was gay.\n \n For someone who adheres to the Bible strictly, their religion would be fundamentally altered if suddenly it was \"OK\" to be gay. That would require the rejection of the portions of the Bible that teach against it.\n\n \n I mentioned above that I would return to the subject of 'tempering' your faith. We have reached that point.\n \n Nobody adheres to the bible strictly. It's not even logically possible to do so, and there's some crazy stuff in there that just isn't done anymore, besides. Everybody rejects portions of the bible.\n \n On whose authority are they doing this?\n \n If you cherry-pick from a set of rules you are necessarily superimposing your own personal values over the doctrine laid down for you. What possible higher authority can the resulting mishmash claim? It is no longer the word of god, it is the edited works of god, with you in the cutting-room.\n \n \nSad\n\n \n I'm guessing I didn't make my sarcasm plain enough :)\n \n \nI don't \"need\" Him to keep me happy either, but I bet I sleep better than you at night. :)\n\n \n I find it bizarre that you would feel confident making such a claim. You are devising a version of your own life without faith and attributing the despair and emptiness you imagine you would feel to someone you have never met. Smokers often can't get to sleep if they don't have a cigarette; should I have a worse night than them, too?\n \n In any case, I would rather lie awake at night wondering if I was doing the right thing in life than sleep like a baby after convincing a young man to strap bombs to himself and step onto a school bus.
