   "Chinese medicine is really not considered \"faith healing\". Chinese medicine is a practice that has been around for a long long time (like 2000 years), and an art that is not seen commonly in the US. Many of the chinese medicines are based on plants, roots, minerals, etc. Many modern western medicines are derived from plants, roots, minerals, etc. Herbal medicine is very effective if you know the right kind of herbs to use for a particular ailment. Chinese medicine is nothing like some pseudo-spiritual lunatic rubbing oils and chanting to cure cancer. Chinese medicine is a legitimate and effective practice.",
