   "The new Energy Bill passed in congress and now headed to the Senate represents little more than corporate welfare fraud. The president, to his credit, asked for a slim and trim $6.7 billion for this bill. Legislators have inflated this number by almost ten times to $66.7 billion. The winners are big oil, big coal, and a revitalized nuke industry backed by huge corporations. The big losers are taxpayers footing this huge bill.\n \n After writing a 1,700 page bill, taxpayers are still at the gas pumps paying high prices. At the same time, the oil industry has posted its largest profits in history the last quarter of this year. Exxon was recently exposed for its huge profits while decreasing refinery production to manipulate the market and keep prices at the pump high. Unbelievably, the billionaire huge corporations are getting billions of dollars in government hand outs. The extra little butt kiss to oil corporations came after discussions were adjourned. Tom Delay, the coordinator of all these handouts to corporations, attached a pork project to give a private business agency in his district with $1.5 billion to hand out as incentives to the (Texas) oil industry.\n \n \"Clean\" Coal plants and Nuclear plants also got most of this money. The only people investing in new Nuclear Power Plants are huge electricity corporations. While there has been improvements in plant safety demonstrated in other countries, nuclear waste disposal has no definitive third party exhaustive study to declare this process safe. Nuclear waste is currently being held at sites all over the US and pose a serious problem for security. The number one terrorist threat according to experts is the \"dirty bomb,\" a rudimentary explosive device to spread nuclear materials to contaminate urban areas. The world has only about 50 years of natural radioactive materials and breeder reactors pose enormous costs and security risks. PHUCA, a minimal regulation agency, is proposed to be discontinued. De-regulation of Electricity led to the Enron scandal in California. Plants were being taken off line for alleged repairs inorder to have black outs and scare people into paying high artificial rates for power. \n \n Huge agricorps benefitted also with an ethanol from corn proposal. This has nothing to do with mom and pop farms and alot to do with a half dozen huge corporations being subsidized to put millions of acres into corn production. Recent advances in enzyme research makes ethanol from crop wastes cost efficient without subsidies, but is being ignored by congress. \n \n The bigger picture is a pizza pie put on a kitchen table. Over four fifths of the pie is going to huge billionaire corporate GOP sponsors. The little slice that is left is a token gesture to cover up the rip off, put on a politically correct facade and hide the corporate hogs at the taxpayer feeding trough. It goes to all of the legitimate alternative energy sources. \n \n The bottom line here is the national debt soon to surpass the $8 trillion mark. Bill after bill after bill has gone through Congress with the presidents slim and trim proposed expenditure. Each time, bills go through congress and reach the president's desk for signature greatly inflated by pork. This is the most reckless spending in history.\n \n For further research and background information, please see articles I have posted at http://www.curevents.com",

   "One thing we Americans can brag about, we have the best politicians money can buy. We must like it that way because we reelect them to office over and over again. There is an old saying in politics, \"The best way to get in office is to be in office\", and that is true. In most elections, the results are determined in the primaries and the general election is just an expensive exercise. The parties control who will represent them, usually an incumbent, and the dominate party wins. In my state this was guaranteed with gerrymandering that eliminated strong opponents from the other party (the shapes of some of the districts are laughable). I would like to see a movement started for the next national election where all would vote AGAINST the incumbent, regardless of the party or the \"L\" or \"C\" label. This just might get their attention, but until then they can continue to count on the sheep to jump for them.\n Dono",

   "From what I've read about the enrgy bill, it blows.\n \n It doesn't do much ( I guess except spread around some pork ).\n \n This article sums it up the best:\n http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0728/p01s02-uspo.html\n \n\n It declines to increase auto efficiency standards to conserve gasoline and decrease pollution. \n\n I think the EPA bothers with this anyway.\n I don't think this will take an act of congress.\n \n \nNor - in the short term, at least - does it do anything to spare American consumers the financial pinch of soaring oil prices, or their dependence on foreign oil, now approaching 60 percent.\n\n I thought this was the whole reason Bush was gunning for it.\n \n If Bush really cares about this, then he should probably veto the bill.\n If he doesn't then he really didn't care about our dependence on foreign oil and just wanted to rush through a bill that most likely benefits friends of his.\n \n \nThe $11.5 billion, 10-year measure provides tax breaks for both energy production and conservation. It would nearly double ethanol production, which advocates say would improve air quality.\n\n Not if it really takes 6 times more energy to produce ethanol than it yields.\n But it depends on which study you accept.\n http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/06/27/MNG1VDF6EM1.DTL\n http://www.cornandsoybeandigest.com/news/Ethanol-Generates-Energy/\n http://www.worldofmolecules.com/fuels/ethanol.htm\n http://www.organicconsumers.org/Politics/ethanolargibus412.cfm\n http://www.ncga.com/public_policy/PDF/03_28_05ArgonneNatlLabEthanolStudy.pdf\n \n I thought this was funny:\n http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/28/AR2005072800446.html\n \nDuring Senate debate, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said that the legislation would bring long-term benefits to consumers. \"You cannot expect an immediate fix,\" she said. \"We didn't get to $2.40 a gallon gasoline overnight. We're not going to remedy it overnight.\"\n\n Yeah, it took about a whole year to creep from $1.25 to $2.25.\n \n\n Supporters said the measure could help bring down natural gas prices by giving the federal government ultimate authority to approve the siting of terminals to receive imports. They said more terminals would be approved.\n\n That's what we need. More imported fuels.\n \n \nThe nuclear industry is among the biggest beneficiaries of the bill. It provides incentives to construct plants and tax breaks for energy produced from them.\n\n If this is true, then this is the best thing the bill can do.",

   "Thank you for the responses. It sounds like I am \"preaching to the choir.\" \n \n gnojeck: Thanks for the links. I agree with everything you are saying about the Energy Bill with the one exception, ethanol. What you are saying that it isn't cost effective is true of corn derived ethanol. What we are talking about here is about a half dozen huge agricorps that will put a million acres into corn that is heavily subsidized. In short, corporate welfare. Ethanol from crop wastes is sponsored by universities and environmentalists. They have had a breakthrough with enzymes that digest more of the crop waste into ethanol. There are indeed cost effective ethanol plants in existence. There is one in Butte County, California and the University of Florida is opening an experimental power plant. Brazil has had cost effective crop waste ethanol for years. So you are right about the ethanol written into the Energy Bill, but ethanol from crop wastes is much more effective ( 32 cents per gallon to produce currently).\n \n Dono and deathlord: As bad as the Energy Bill was, the Highway Bill is almost all pork and passed the House with only two dissenting votes. So we are talking about Republicrats and Demopublicans when it comes to pork. Everyone wants to bring home the bacon, as it ingratiates legislators with the voters and they get re-elected. \n \n Ralph Nadar was on target on these issues but has never been a viable candidate. I am hoping John McCain runs this next time as a moderate independent. He is very strong against pork. \n \n I have most of my supporting articles posted (with discussions) at www.curevents.com.",

Brazil has had cost effective crop waste ethanol for years. So you are right about the ethanol written into the Energy Bill, but ethanol from crop wastes is much more effective ( 32 cents per gallon to produce currently).\n \n\n \n \n Wrong. I own half a stake in an experimentla ethanol project. Even using the new and imporved enzyme production methods, the only way you get to 32 cents per gallon is by applicaiton of a $1 per gallon subsidy fromt he government and by discounting the cost of feedstock transportation (which is incredibly expensive because it is such a low density feedstock). Every report issued by such projects (mine included) doctors the numbers in an attempt to make the technology appear viable. Real production cost (to the pump) from our operation is $3.85 per gallon (stated production cost is 41 cents per gallon). The cheapest real production cost in the country is $3.21 per gallon (their stated cost is 32 cents per gallon). The reality of the situation is that we scam the numbers in order to continue pulling governmetn grants. Acquisition of grants is the only place you make money in the fuel ethanol market.\n \n Additionally, as you scale up such operations, there is an energy return threshold that you reach where it becomes even more expensive to produce than smaller quantities. It is also worth noting that corn is heavily subsidised, so the true cost of fuels may be as much as 2x recognised numbers.\n \n In order to replace half of the oil we use for fuel with ethanol, we would have to plant the entire states of kansas, oklahoma, nebraska, iowa, south dakota, and missouri, in corn crops exclusively for ethanol production. The entire state of Nevada and Arizona would have to be tranformed into giant processing facilites. Nevada and Arizona are no great losses, but the other sates liste provide over 80% of the food we eat, so we would have to find som way to make up that difference.\n \n BUT, like fuel cell technology (which is a loser in the end as well), as long as the general public believes that ethanol is a viable source fo energy and a possible solution ot our energy problems, the government will continue to subsidize it, which will make it a proftable investment at the private level, even if it is a net loss to the public.",

Japan is now importing it as a replacement for MTBE inorder to meet higher emission standards. I know that Arco is famous for higher mixes of ethanol and gasoline in order to cut costs and maintain octane rating. Brazil has been using ethanol for years, as they must find alternatives for gas in their situation. Cars are required now to use up to 25 percent ethanol to gas mixtures.
