By the standards of others who do not see my religion as a true faith, they do not believe I am a Christian, or what they would call a \"true Christian\". Christianity in and of itself according the dictionary is simply \"1 a : one who professes belief in the teachings of Jesus Christ b (1) : DISCIPLE 2 (2) : a member of one of the Churches of Christ separating from the Disciples of Christ in 1906 (3) : a member of the Christian denomination having part in the union of the United Church of Christ concluded in 1961\"\n Some feel that in order to be a Christian you must not only go church, but to their church or a church of the same faith. Who is right? Who knows? It's all perception.",

   "Christian: Someone who believes that Jesus is the Son of God/Savior. I don't understand why it matters so much whether they go to church or not, so long as they lead a good life. The problem I have is with people who call themselves Messianic Jews. The main separation between Christianity and Judaism is that Jews believe that Jesus was a false prophet, while Christians believe he was the Son of God/Savior. Messianic Jews are Jews who believe that Jesus was Elijah. Elijah was the savior coming at the end of the world. Therefore, Messianic Jews are not actually Jews. Woudln't they be better called Archaic Christians (for lack of a better term at this time)",
