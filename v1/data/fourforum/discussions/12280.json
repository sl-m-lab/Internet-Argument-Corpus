   "You mean such words as \"Bring my enemies before me and say them\" \n matthew \n 10:34 Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.\n \n 10:35 For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.\n \n 10:36 And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.\n 10:37 He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.\n\n \n You can't help but distort the truth in order to imply Jesus is saying something He never actually said, can you trebor. Where does that passage say \"bring my enemies before me\"? It is just in your nature to corrupt the truth which you so willfully reject. Note the bolded sword; He is speaking about the sword of truth which He represents in the world. Now here is your quoted passage with the verses before and after it which completes the message He was giving. Of course you must redact those parts because they clarify what He was really saying rather than make Him appear to be a divider rather than the sword of truth which will clearly distinguish the deceiver from truth seeker. And with your post, you have clearly shown which side of that fence you fall on.\n Matthew 10:32 \"Whoever acknowledges me before men, I will also acknowledge him before my Father in heaven. 33But whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven.\n \n 34\"Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword. 35For I have come to turn \n \" 'a man against his father, \n a daughter against her mother, \n a daughter-in-law against her motherinlaw&#8212; \n 36a man's enemies will be the members of his own household.'[e]\n \n 37\"Anyone who loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me; 38and anyone who does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me. 39Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.\n \n 40\"He who receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives the one who sent me. 41Anyone who receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet's reward, and anyone who receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man will receive a righteous man's reward. 42And if anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones because he is my disciple, I tell you the truth, he will certainly not lose his reward.\"",

   "One doesn't need to \"prove\" every aspect of science to \"disprove\" that Genesis is not science. The evidence (rhetorical and theological) that Genesis was written as a poem or song is quite convincing. That doesn't mean it is \"fictional\" - it is an inspired work, and there are many other historically valid poems. However, there are way too many metaphors in Genesis that cause conflict when one tries to read it literally. Read figuratively though, it all complements science very well.\n After all, the Big Bang doesn't say that God's word was not involved. It simply seeks to explore the mechanism, to give us understanding. Science increases our knowledge of God; it doesn't seek to contradict faith.\n what's really the difference between \"let there be light\" and \"the big bang\" - except for semantics - it's the same idea!!\n see songofgenesis.org for a better, more detailed explanation.",
