Since the gene was cloned in 1989, more than 100 LPL gene mutations have been identified, the majority of which cause loss of enzymatic function. In contrast to this, the naturally occurring LPLS447X variant is associated with increased lipolytic function and an anti-atherogenic lipid profile and can therefore be regarded as a gain-of-function mutation. This notion combined with the facts that 20% of the general population carries this prematurely truncated LPL and that it may protect against cardiovascular disease has led to extensive clinical and basic research into this frequent LPL mutant. It is only until recently that we begin to understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie the beneficial effects associated with LPLS447X.

They are genetically and anatomically much different than we are, and the fossil record confirms that we did not evolve from them. We have a common ancestor with them, a basal anthropoid primate. Farther up the chain, we share a more recent common ancestor with old world monkeys and apes, but we didn't evolve from any of them either. They are cousins, not granparents.\n \n \nIn fact it is said that prior to us becoming land dwellers, we lived in trees just as monkeys still do.\n\n \n No. The tree-dwelling apes that remain (and they are quite different than our ancestors) don't live as monkeys do. The Hylobates have much different ways of moving about and getting food than monkeys.\n \n \nSo please clarify what you mean by saying that monkeys are too evolved for us to have evolved from them as it makes no sense.\n\n \n Because you understand so little of biology, you stumble at almost every step.

Indeed, monkeys were more widespread than humans for a very long time.\n \n \nIt makes no sense that our very presence wouldn't have been a catalyst for promoting their evolution toward higher and more sophisticated reasoning and creativity. \n\n \n What a bizarre idea. In fact, when a species is already filling a niche, it's very difficult for another population to take advantage of it. For example, after the end of the dinosaurs, mammals became the dominant grazing and browsing animals, although birds would be quite capable of doing the same thing. In New Zealand, where mammals were not established until discovered by man, birds did just that. They were free to evolve into that niche, because there was no competition from mammals.\n \n \nYet it hasn't had any impact on their need to evolve at all.\n\n \n There is no intrinsic \"need to evolve.\" Indeed, a well-adapted population in a stable environment will evolve little if at all.",

Most mutations don't do much of anything. A few are harmful, and a very few are useful. If you take a look at the process, using bacteria, so you can get a large number of mutations in a reasonable time, you see that the few bad ones are removed rather quickly, and the very few good ones tend to persist and accumulate.\n \n \nEspecially if that 1 mutation with the percieved benefit was the result of losing information.\n\n \n All mutations, even harmful ones, increase information in a population.

Gene duplication is usually the mechanism by which that is prevented. Typically, an existing gene gets duplicated in replication (a common thing; many of our genes are duplicated) and then the extra copy is free to mutate without harming the organism. The resulting additional information is sometimes useful the the organism, and is retained by natural selection.\n \n \nThe belief system has nothing to do with the scientific method as you say. It has everything to do with interpreting the results.\n\n \n That's why so many of us accept evolution. It works.

The actual gene encodes a protein of 475 amino acids that becomes a mature protein of 448 amino acids after cleavage of a signal peptide. One study was able to identify 3 common SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) in the coding region of the gene, 2 of which result in small changes in enzyme function in European populations. The third SNP converts that locus to a stop codon and results in an enzyme that is 447 amino acids long. Thus, the enzyme has been truncated. The resulting enzyme, LPL S447X, is functional.

Yet it hasn't had any impact on their need to evolve at all.\n \nHow can monkeys be far too evolved to give rise to man, when #1, they share so much common DNA\n\n \n \nThey don't. They are as far from us as wolverines are from bears. Moreover, both the fossil record and lack of shared apomorphies (relative to apes) make it clear that we did not evolve from monkeys.\n\n \n Is that right? emoticon_confused You know what barbarian, debating with you is like debating with a greased eel. You evolutionists are no more consistent than the direction a tornado travels. How do you explain this: hypgnosys: human vs. monkey.\n human vs. monkey.\n the human dna and monkey dna is estimated to be between 96 and 98% identical, which to many is enough to suggest we are related genetically.\n \n the thing is, we are as similar to dogs and dolphins too.\n \n it is the differences that make us unique.\n \n monkeys have 24 chromasome pairs, whereas we have only 23.\n \n we are devolved monkeys?\n POSTED BY DR.ALISTAIR\n And don't you get it yet that I'm not suggesting that we actually evolved from any other creature? Beside that, you have again changed the goalpost from what you said above that I was responding to. I was responding to your claim that, and I quote: Monkeys are far to evolved in their own way to give rise to us. I was showing that monkeys are precisely where evolutionists claim we were before we left trees to become ground dwellers which evolved to walk upright. Now you're treating me like I implied we evolved from them. You must constantly back pedal and redefine the parameters of the debate in the hope of at least sounding consistent. But that's impossible because there is no consistency in your religion of evolution at all. So is that what you're claiming barbarian? Are we devolved monkeys with all of our intellectual advances? \n \n \n ====================================================================================================\n \nand #2, they are listed as a lower life form than we are?\n\n \n \nThey aren't. \"Lower\" has no meaning in biology. They are, like all living organisms, at the top of the bush. They are, many of them much more evolved and specialized than we are. \n \n\n \n Yet, on the tree of life Man is the ultimate Apex animal on Earth. So you are playing a game of semantics with me because you know darn well they are a lower life form than we are. And just to point out more inconsistency in your rationale, it is ridiculous to say this: They are, like all living organisms, at the top of the bush. How can you, as an alleged christian, not appreciate or acknowledge at the very least, that God created Man in His image and He created us above the animals? And that includes monkeys? You are an embarrassment to christian principles an no different than the most committed atheist in your commitment to scriptural theology.\n \n \n\"Social construct\" is not how you measure relatedness. They are genetically and anatomically much different than we are, and the fossil record confirms that we did not evolve from them. We have a common ancestor with them, a basal anthropoid primate. Farther up the chain, we share a more recent common ancestor with old world monkeys and apes, but we didn't evolve from any of them either. They are cousins, not granparents.\n\n \n None of which you can or will ever prove genetically. And I wasn't using social construct to measure relatedness at all. What I was doing was showing that Man is the measure of how far all life can evolve if evolution was true. But only Man has evolved higher functions of reason, creativity and intellect. No other creature has learned to record their history or control the elements as we have. No species beside us has learned to cooperate in trade or services in order to make life easier for all of them. They still live according to the rules of survival where one animal consumes another according to its kind. \n \n You must spend half your time denying rational thought regarding the inconsistencies with evolutionary theory, and the other half attempting to justify them. It makes no sense to you either, yet you continue to defend it which is why evolution is your true religion and you just use this claim of orthodox christianity as a cover so you can debate against creationists and claim access to their beliefs. But you don't accept the bible as true in any way because in every debate you deny it as you defend evolution.\n \n And would you cut out this \"Barbarian observes:\" bunk. It makes you look stupid as if I don't know the thoughts that follow it are yours. emoticon_xdonno",

   "Barbarian observes:\n The evidence shows that reptiles did give rise to birds, but nothing shows monkeys became humans.\n \n \nGot any evidence that this is a fact?\n\n \n Sure. I showed you why monkeys could not have given rise to humans. Would you now like to learn how we know dinosaurs gave rise to birds?\n \n \nHow can monkeys be far too evolved to give rise to man, when #1, they share so much common DNA\n\n \n Barbarian observes:\n They don't. They are as far from us as wolverines are from bears. Moreover, both the fossil record and lack of shared apomorphies (relative to apes) make it clear that we did not evolve from monkeys.\n \n The new analysis of the rhesus monkey genome, conducted by an international consortium of more than 170 scientists, also reveals that humans and the macaques share about 93 percent of their DNA. By comparison, humans and chimpanzees share about 98 to 99 percent of their DNA. \n \n The fact that rhesus monkeys are further away from humans in evolution will help illuminate what makes humans different from other apes in ways that chimps, which are so closely related to us, could not, Gibbs said. (Rhesus monkey ancestors diverged from those of humans roughly 25 million years ago, while chimpanzees diverged from our lineage 6 million years ago.) \n http://www.livescience.com/health/070412_rhesus_monkeys.html\n \n For perspective, keep in mind that you have more genes in common with a bacterium, than genes by which you differ.\n \n \n and #2, they are listed as a lower life form than we are?\n\n \n Barbarian observes:\n They aren't. \"Lower\" has no meaning in biology. They are, like all living organisms, at the top of the bush. They are, many of them much more evolved and specialized than we are.\n \n \nAnd #3, we were once allegedly tree dwellers exactly like modern monkeys still are?\n\n \n Barbarian observes:\n So are squirrels and iguanas. Common habitat is not a measure of evolutionary distance.\n \n \nNothing in their social construct reflects them being too evolved in any way.\n\n \n Barbarian observes:\n \"Social construct\" is not how you measure relatedness. They are genetically and anatomically much different than we are, and the fossil record confirms that we did not evolve from them. We have a common ancestor with them, a basal anthropoid primate. Farther up the chain, we share a more recent common ancestor with old world monkeys and apes, but we didn't evolve from any of them either. They are cousins, not granparents.\n \n \nIn fact it is said that prior to us becoming land dwellers, we lived in trees just as monkeys still do.\n\n \n Barbarian observes:\n No. The tree-dwelling apes that remain (and they are quite different than our ancestors) don't live as monkeys do. The Hylobates have much different ways of moving about and getting food than monkeys.\n \n \nSo please clarify what you mean by saying that monkeys are too evolved for us to have evolved from them as it makes no sense.\n\n \n Barbarian observes:\n Because you understand so little of biology, you stumble at almost every step. If you learned a little of the fundamentals, it would help you very much.\n \n \nIt seems to me, if you were being consistent, you would say that monkeys are on the same evolutionary track as Man, except that they are still in the tree bound stage of evolution.\n\n \n Barbarian observes:\n No. None of them are on that track. Even baboons, the most ape-like of monkeys, have gone in a different direction than apes.\n \n \nWhat makes no sense though is how man jumped so far ahead of these other primates\n\n \n Barbarian observes:\n We haven't. We've just evolved intelligence, while others have gone in different directions. Until very recently, we weren't much more successful than many monkey species. Indeed, monkeys were more widespread than humans for a very long time.\n \n \nIt makes no sense that our very presence wouldn't have been a catalyst for promoting their evolution toward higher and more sophisticated reasoning and creativity.\n\n \n Barbarian observes:\n What a bizarre idea. In fact, when a species is already filling a niche, it's very difficult for another population to take advantage of it. For example, after the end of the dinosaurs, mammals became the dominant grazing and browsing animals, although birds would be quite capable of doing the same thing. In New Zealand, where mammals were not established until discovered by man, birds did just that. They were free to evolve into that niche, because there was no competition from mammals.\n \n \nYet it hasn't had any impact on their need to evolve at all.\n\n \n Barbarian observes:\n There is no intrinsic \"need to evolve.\" Indeed, a well-adapted population in a stable environment will evolve little if at all.\n \n \nhuman vs. monkey.\n the human dna and monkey dna is estimated to be between 96 and 98% identical, which to many is enough to suggest we are related genetically.\n\n \n You've confused humans and chimps. Monkey DNA varies considerably within the two major groups of monkeys, but no monkey comes close to that kind of similarity.\n \n \nthe thing is, we are as similar to dogs and dolphins too.\n\n \n Nope. Here's a chart, showing primate relatedness as measured by DNA. Notice that all apes are more similar to each other than to any monkey, and that humans are more closely related to chimps than any other primate. \n http://genomics.senescence.info/evolution/primates.gif\n \n Here's a chart showing mammals. Note that all primates are rather distantly removed from canines and cetaceans.\n http://www.noanswersingenesis.org.au/Eutheria.gif\n \n \n monkeys have 24 chromasome pairs, whereas we have only 23.\n\n \n You're a bit confused here. Chimps have 24 pairs; monkeys vary a lot. We have 23, and that's an interesting story. Seems the human #2 chromosome looks exactly like two chimp chromosomes fused. Scientists then looked and even found the remains of two telomeres and a centromere, just where they would be, if it was the result of a fusion:\n http://www.gate.net/~rwms/hum_ape_chrom_2.gif\n \n \n And don't you get it yet that I'm not suggesting that we actually evolved from any other creature? Beside that, you have again changed the goalpost from what you said above that I was responding to. I was responding to your claim that, and I quote: Monkeys are far to evolved in their own way to give rise to us.\n\n \n Yep. Monkeys have all sorts of features that show they've evolved considerably from the basal anthropoid primate. Would you like to learn about some of that?\n \n \nI was showing that monkeys are precisely where evolutionists claim we were before we left trees to become ground dwellers which evolved to walk upright.\n \n \n Now, you know better.\n \n \nSo is that what you're claiming barbarian? Are we devolved monkeys with all of our intellectual advances?\n \n \n I just showed you that humans could not have evolved from monkeys. \n \n \nYet, on the tree of life Man is the ultimate Apex animal on Earth. \n\n \n Nope. That's your imagination. Science doesn't say that.\n \n \nHow can you, as an alleged christian, not appreciate or acknowledge at the very least, that God created Man in His image\n \n \n God doesn't have a body, no fingernails or eyebrows, or such. He's a spirit, and as Jesus says, spirits have no bodies. The \"image\" is in our minds and souls, being capable of understanding good and evil, and therefore potentially capable of fellowship with Him.\n \n \nBut you don't accept the bible as true in any way because in every debate you deny it as you defend evolution.\n\n \n As we discussed earlier, I just accept all of it as it is. You accept the parts that appeal to you.\n \n \nAnd would you cut out this \"Barbarian observes:\" bunk. It makes you look stupid as if I don't know the thoughts that follow it are yours. \n\n \n Barbarian observes:\n Habit. Get used to it.",

   "Archie, how the hell do you expect anyone to take you seriously when you don't know the difference between a monkey and a chimp? Or when you state that the \"tree of life\" shows man at the top, then post a diagram of a \"tree of life\" with man below birds and plants?\n \n Really, what could you expect in return but ridicule?\n\n \n Let me ask you this tq, by what standard of rationale do you presume that birds and plants belong above Man on the tree of life? Beside, I was posting that chart to show that man was at the top of the mammal line, not as a comparison to the others. But of course you guys would completely ignore that aspect of the point I was making.\n \n Also, how can you accuse me of not understanding the difference between monkeys and chimps when chimps weren't even being discussed. For example, the rhesus macaque monkey's genome reveals that humans and the macaques share about 93 percent of their DNA. (Genetic similarities differ with different monkeys)These are not insignificant similarities with the Rhesus though, yet you will boldly claim our lineage from chimps based on only 5% more genetic similarities, when it is our differences which define us as human, not our similarities. That is proven by the human and mice, and every other species which share many genetic similarities with us, yet are as vastly different from us as a common mouse is. \n \n So to answer your question directly, I don't expect you to take me seriously no matter what I say, just as I will never take you and your cohorts seriously based on the wild imaginings you claim are scientifically based conclusions.

   "Smallax: \"One can 'know' that 2+2=4 - but one can only 'believe' that the earth is millions of years old.\"\n \n Ah, the old empirical/mathemtatical split! But with this simple sentence, you have opened many more cans of worms than you realize. Some questions:\n \n 1. Does this \"only believe\" restriction apply to all empirical claims? Let's use ages for examples, since that was what you applied it to. Can I \"know\" that Jerusalem was founded several thousand years ago, or can I \"only believe\" it? Can I know that the United States is more than two hundred years old, or can I only believe it? Can I know that my father was born in 1948, or can I only believe it?\n \n I mean, heck, I wasn't around for any of those things. So how could I claim to know them?\n \n I think you're being a bit overly restrictive about what constitutes \"knowledge.\"\n \n 2. But even supposing that you're not -- i.e., supposing that I can indeed \"only believe\" all these things -- this wouldn't imply that all \"mere beliefs\" are equally plausible. Grant that I can only believe that the earth is billions of years old. I would retort that, by the same token, you can only believe that it's a few thousand years old. The question then becomes, which belief is more likely to be accurate? I think that the billions of years option is right, because it's consistent with observations and with ideas corroborated by those observations. The thousands of years idea is not.\n \n Science is just an extension of perfectly ordinary ideas concerning how to draw inferences from empirical evidence that we all use every day. We make such inferences all the time, and even if we grant that they don't yield \"knowledge\" (which I think, as already noted, is too restrictive, but which I am willing to grant for the sake of argument), they allows us to figure out which beliefs are more accurate than other beliefs.\n \n The upshot of which is that, even if I grant your distinction, it doesn't solve the problem of whether we should believe the earth to be billions or only thousands of years old.\n \n 3. But why should we even grant the distinction in favor of mathematics being knowledge as opposed to mere belief? I mean, a lot of modern mathematics has shown what happens when you dump the basic axioms of classical mathematics. Non-Euclidean geomotry, for example, can dispense with the parallel postulate, yet still come up with useful ideas that have practical applications (ever taken a transoceanic flight?).\n \n So I'm inclined not to make a radical split between math and everything else.\n \n To sum up: I do think that you're being way to restrictive about the definition of \"knowledge.\" And in a way that, ironically, even your own belief system couldn't possibly meet. And also in a way that, more ironically still, continues to strike me as an \"all beliefs are equal\" post-modern mess that makes knowledge of any kind utterly impossible.",

Why do you hold us to a higher, or different standard of deducing what is true than you yourselves require regarding evolution?\"\n \n No cop out whatsoever. If you require direct observation for knowledge, then you will very quickly find yourself unable to know much of anything.\n \n And it has nothing to do with evolution specifically. It's a general point of epistemology. The reason I brought it up is that I was curious to know how far you would be willing to go with the requirement.\n \n I'm going to presume, for example, that you were not present either when God created the world, or when those events were described by the author of Genesis. So since you have no direct observation of them, and you yourself have required direct observation for knowledge, how can you reasonably claim to know how God did it (or even that He did, for that matter), or how accurate the Biblical description is?\n \n I am not exercising any double standard here. I'm simply asking you to apply the very standard you yourself requested to your own views. Personally, I think requiring direct observation for knowledge is far too high. Heck, even direct observations can be misleading. Ever put a stick in water and see it bend?...\n \n Archangel: \"They take the partial fossilized remains of extinct primates and make huge assumptions that they are ancestors of human beings. Especially since the criteria they use is the alleged age of the fossil so they can say it fits in some imagined evolutionary timeline.\"\n \n Here I would like some discussion of what you consider to be a reasonable use of empirical evidence in unlocking the past. Because what you consider \"assumptions\" I consider inferences, based on perfectly ordinary ways of getting around in the world.\n \n Moreover, I am curious why you consider ages of fossils to be merely \"alleged.\" Of course there is margin for error. But scientists don't just make this stuff up. They have reasons and evidence for why they consider a given fossil to be of a given age. Why are they wrong?\n \n Archangel: \"...as the Word of God, His Holy Spirit supernaturally inspired the writers of the bible, so the bible calls itself and is in fact Gods Word, thus, it is the word of God.\"\n \n But why should I believe the Bible when it says that?\n \n If a Muslim made similar claims about the Koran, or a Hindu about the Bhagavad-Gita, why shouldn't I agree with them instead of you?\n \n Or if you were conversing with a Muslim or Hindu who thought his holy book of choice were divinely inspired, to what would you appeal to convince them otherwise? Appealing to your own is probably not going to do the trick. Any more than their appeals to their holy texts would convince you to drop your religion and convert to theirs.\n \n This is just a classic example of circular reasoning. Why should I trust what the Bible says? Because it's divinely inspired. But why should I believe that it's divinely inspired? Because it says so.",

   "Archangel: \"Yet these hypocrites have been going out of there way to deny that fact as they attempt to imply that all life is equal in the world of biological evolution.\"\n \n I know of no evolutionist who has denied that humans are at the top of the food chain. We impact the entire planet in a way that no other species does. Clearly. And this has brought about some things that are undeniably good for ourselves, and even for many other organisms (e.g. domesticated plants and pets and cohabitors). It has also brought about some things that are undeniably bad for other organisms, and for ourselves as well, unfortunately.\n \n This \"all life is equal\" thing is very strange to me. I'm really not sure what you're getting at with this as a criticism.\n \n Consider monkeys and humans. If the current evolutionary view is correct, our lineage split from that of the old world monkeys about 25 million years, and from that of the new world monkeys about 15 million years before that. Over that whole span of 40 million years, the new world monkeys, old world monkeys, and apes and humans have all been evolving to deal with their different stituations. And they've all succeeded up to now.\n \n So in purely temporal terms, we've all been at it \"equally\" long. And in some highly abstract sense, I suppose we've all succeeded \"equally\" well at adapting to our diverse environments (though that's something of an apples and oranges comparison). Squirrel monkeys in the trees of the Amazon and humans across the world continue to survive and reproduce, as their parents before them and their children after. Squirrel monkeys don't have big brains, but they don't need them to do what they do. We don't have grooming claws, but we don't need them to do what we do.\n \n Why any of this should be taken as implying \"equality\" for animals, such that we should never eat them, or think that their well-being matters just as much as ours, is not at all clear. There might be reasons why we shouldn't eat animals, or why we should give them at least some moral consideration, but those have nothing to do with evolution.\n \n I mean, for pete's sake, look at Peter Singer's Animal Liberation. The opening chapter is \"All Animals are Equal.\" Seems to play right into your hand, right? But seriously, look at what he says: His argument invokes capacities for pleasure and pain, not evolution at all; he doesn't think that equal consideration means equal treatment; and he explicitly casts the argument in evaluative, normative terms and not descriptive, factual terms. The argument is about ought, not is.\n \n So I can't figure out where this \"equality\" schtick is coming from. There's no good biological reason to regard humans as \"higher\" than animals. There may be good reasons to regard them that way from religious or philosophical or moral or political perspectives. Or maybe not, of course. But then we're having a different argument, that has nothing to do with evolution or biology or science.\n \n Archangel: \"My similarities to my family is evidence of a familial relationship. To suggest that it is evidence that I evolved through lower primates, and prior to that, from biological organisms is an example of that purely subjective feeling you are accusing me of in the quote below.\"\n \n First, I did not suggest that your similarities to your family were evidence of your evolution from primates and earlier organisms. I suggested that your greater genetic similarities to your family than to me is evidence that you are more closely related to your family than you are to me.\n \n Second, this greater similarity is  indeed indicative of a familial relationship! But this genealogical conclusion applies to all familial relationships: you relative to your family, humans generally relative to other primates, primates generally relative to other mammals, mammals relative to other vertebrates, and so on and so on.\n \n Archangel: \"This [my charge of 'argument from incredulity'] is just a tactic to avoid actually responding to the point I was making by focussing on minutia rather than the substance of my argument.\"\n \n Not so. I addressed your claims quite substantively, and then pointed out that in any event, incredulity is irrelevant.\n \n What is illegitimate about that? It's just pointing out a perceived flaw in the reasoning. If you think you didn't commit the mistake, fine. But don't throw a fit about it. Explain to me why you weren't invoking your own incredulity as a reason why the reader ought to likewise find evolution unbelievable. Maybe I'm wrong.\n \n But I don't think so. And in general, I try to avoid saying things like \"I find x incredible\" or \"It's beyond me that anyone believes x.\" (I probably slip up now and then, but I try.) Because it doesn't matter whether I find something unbelievable. If other people find the idea more credible than I, they won't be left incredulous by my statement of exasperation. They'll just think that I'm wrong, and probably a bit closed-minded.\n \n By the way, is it okay if I point out something about your interaction with Barbarian? He only keeps saying \"Barbarian observes\" to account for the fact that the quote function tends to omit things. He's distinguishing between (1)what he originally wrote and to which you responded, and (2) what he's now writing in response to your response. Putting him on ignore for that seems a trifle... trifling.",

   "\n Archangel: \"This is a cop out based on the massive conclusions evolutionists come to based on the so called observations they hold up as evidence that evolution is valid. Why do you hold us to a higher, or different standard of deducing what is true than you yourselves require regarding evolution?\"\n \n No cop out whatsoever. If you require direct observation for knowledge, then you will very quickly find yourself unable to know much of anything.\n \n And it has nothing to do with evolution specifically. It's a general point of epistemology. The reason I brought it up is that I was curious to know how far you would be willing to go with the requirement.\n \n I'm going to presume, for example, that you were not present either when God created the world, or when those events were described by the author of Genesis. So since you have no direct observation of them, and you yourself have required direct observation for knowledge, how can you reasonably claim to know how God did it (or even that He did, for that matter), or how accurate the Biblical description is?\n\n \n Although your point accurately fits the false faith evolutionists have in this pseudo, man made science, it fails miserably when applied to believers in Christ. You see Matthew, I do have first hand personal knowledge and experience regarding Gods interaction with human beings by way of His direct involvement in my life through supernatural intervention by way of His Holy Spirit which indwells all believers, and me personally.\n \n It's true that I wasn't there during either the Creation event, or when Genesis was written. Just as you weren't there when the Earth was created or life began from your perspective. The difference between us is that my faith in my Gods word is trustworthy, faithful and well placed because He is truly God. But your faith is in the shallow observations of men who have completely misinterpreted the available evidence which can just more easily fit my scenario than yours. In other words Matthew, it takes more faith to believe as you do than it does for me to believe as I do since I personally know my God is alive and well and is not a liar. Therefore, even though I never personally observed what He say's about the 6 day creation event, I know He is trustworthy in His word and deed. Can you say the same about the men who's science you follow? I think not. \n \n \nI am not exercising any double standard here. I'm simply asking you to apply the very standard you yourself requested to your own views. Personally, I think requiring direct observation for knowledge is far too high. Heck, even direct observations can be misleading. Ever put a stick in water and see it bend?...\n\n \n The stick in the water which bends is a perfect example of the inconsistency and false results which evolutionists come to in every aspect of how they misinterpret the observations they claim is evidence for evolution. \n \n \nArchangel: \"They take the partial fossilized remains of extinct primates and make huge assumptions that they are ancestors of human beings. Especially since the criteria they use is the alleged age of the fossil so they can say it fits in some imagined evolutionary timeline.\"\n \n Here I would like some discussion of what you consider to be a reasonable use of empirical evidence in unlocking the past. Because what you consider \"assumptions\" I consider inferences, based on perfectly ordinary ways of getting around in the world.\n\n \n Follow these debates for a while and you will see your evolutionist cohorts making all kinds of absolute statements of fact until I blow holes in them, then they will claim science is based on ever changing input which clarifies the end result. But in real science, there are absolute laws of physics which dictate consistent and reliable outcome. But not in evo. That is as fluid as an ever changing fairy tale which must constantly adjust to answer for newly discovered evidence which conflicts with and contradicts prior assumptions.\n \n \nMoreover, I am curious why you consider ages of fossils to be merely \"alleged.\" Of course there is margin for error. But scientists don't just make this stuff up. They have reasons and evidence for why they consider a given fossil to be of a given age. Why are they wrong?\n\n \n Sure they do in a way. They call 5,000 or 10,000 year old fossils are 200 and 300 million years old, and older. They have taken the same object and tested it 5 times with the same machine and come up with 5 different ages for it. They can't accurately allow for different rates of decay since they don't know the objects age before testing it. So the whole process is based on circular reasoning at its most basic level. \n \n What I marvel at is allegedly intelligent, minds of analytical scientists can't see these obvious contradictions in their methodology.\n \n Archangel: \"...as the Word of God, His Holy Spirit supernaturally inspired the writers of the bible, so the bible calls itself and is in fact Gods Word, thus, it is the word of God.\"\n \n But why should I believe the Bible when it says that?\n \n If a Muslim made similar claims about the Koran, or a Hindu about the Bhagavad-Gita, why shouldn't I agree with them instead of you?[/QUOTE]\n \n This requires spiritual discernment. Something the natural man could never relate to. Every other belief system on Earth apart from Christ is a cult designed specifically to satisfy mans innate desire to worship God whild simultaneously leading men away from the living God. We are in a spiritual battle, but the natural man is clueless to the reality of this struggle between good and evil. \n \n \nOr if you were conversing with a Muslim or Hindu who thought his holy book of choice were divinely inspired, to what would you appeal to convince them otherwise? Appealing to your own is probably not going to do the trick. Any more than their appeals to their holy texts would convince you to drop your religion and convert to theirs.\n \n This is just a classic example of circular reasoning. Why should I trust what the Bible says? Because it's divinely inspired. But why should I believe that it's divinely inspired? Because it says so.\n\n \n This is why the bible say's that \"if we grope out into the darkness, God will find us\" and \"if we seek the truth, the truth will set us free\". It's also why each man must seek God personally and not rely on the word of others before committing to a so called religious commitment. This might shock you but I hate religion. It is a man made concept which has led astray and corrupted countess people throughout history, many of the most powerful and most corrupted religious leaders in history have been popes who claimed to speak for God but never even knew Him personally. \n \n So Christianity isn't a religion my friend, it's a relationship with a living God who created us in His image, with free will for willing fellowship with Him as His children who have the choice, but choose to be with Him.",

   "Archangel: \"Although your point accurately fits the false faith evolutionists have in this pseudo, man made science, it fails miserably when applied to believers in Christ.\"\n \n Not to all believers in Christ. I have met many Christians who regard belief on the basis of faith as quite distinct from knowledge. And I've read more than a few as well.\n \n Archangel: \"You see Matthew, I do have first hand personal knowledge and experience regarding Gods interaction with human beings by way of His direct involvement in my life through supernatural intervention by way of His Holy Spirit which indwells all believers, and me personally.\"\n \n And if you were content to treat that personal knowledge as something that were truly personal -- as somthing that indeed could not by its very nature be communicated to others without completely changing its meaning and significance -- well, then I don't think we'd be having this discussion.\n \n I happen to be an ardent admirer of Kierkegaard, who I think was the most insightful religious thinker of the last two centuries, bar none. \"Christianity is subjectivity\" -- now that is something for any and every believer to mull over, for a long time.\n \n -----\n \n Archangel: \"It's true that I wasn't there during either the Creation event, or when Genesis was written. Just as you weren't there when the Earth was created or life began from your perspective.\"\n \n At least we agree on something!\n \n Archangel: \"The difference between us is that my faith in my Gods word is trustworthy, faithful and well placed because He is truly God.\"\n \n I have absolutely no doubt that you are convinced of this. But I'm not convinced that your religious beliefs are even remotely correct, and it's going to take a lot more than sincerity to convince me. I want some reasons, and non-circular reasons at that. \n \n Archangel: \"But your faith\" --\n \n Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait just a minute. What do you know about \"my faith?\" Isn't it just a tad presumptuous of you to says what I believe?\n \n Okay.Back to the point.\n \n Archangel: \"But your faith is in the shallow observations of men who have completely misinterpreted the available evidence which can just more easily fit my scenario than yours.\"\n \n Please be specific about the misinterpretations. Because there is a lot of evidence out there.\n \n Archangel: \"In other words Matthew, it takes more faith to believe as you do than it does for me to believe as I do...\"\n \n I disagree, because I think you're confusing \"inference\" with \"faith.\" But even granting your point, if you take faith to be a good thing, then the above cannot serve as a criticism of my beliefs. Be consistent.\n \n Archangel: \"...since I personally know my God is alive and well and is not a liar.\"\n \n Again, if you explored and acknowledged the constraints of that qualifier \"personally,\" I'm not sure we'd have much to argue about.\n \n Archangel: \"Therefore, even though I never personally observed what He say's about the 6 day creation event, I know He is trustworthy in His word and deed.\"\n \n -sigh- Which now means that you are not going to require direct observation as a criterion of knowledge. So what we need to argue about is what reasonable criteria other than direct observation there are. And I don't think that appeals to the infallibility of literal interpretations of religious texts are reasonable. They are not literally true, as can be ascertained by the time you get through chapter 2 of Genesis. And no text is infallible, especially not just for the reason that it says so.\n \n Archangel: \"Can you say the same about the men who's science you follow? I think not.\"\n \n To the contrary, I think so in the case of science. And I think so, because all science does is start with the ways that we know anything at all -- including something as simple as \"I am a human being, sitting in front of a computer\" -- and refine them so that we can know a lot more than what's right in front of us at any given time.\n \n If scientists were half as misguided as you seem to think they are about things that they cannot observe directly, then you and I wouldn't be able to have this discussion, because computers and the internet wouldn't work.\n \n -----\n \n Archangel: \"The stick in the water which bends is a perfect example of the inconsistency and false results which evolutionists come to in every aspect of how they misinterpret the observations they claim is evidence for evolution.\"\n \n Specifics please. This is just an empty declaration. It certainly doesn't address the point I made with the stick in the water example, which is that even direct observations can be misleading.\n \n -----\n \n Archangel: \"Follow these debates for a while and you will see your evolutionist cohorts making all kinds of absolute statements of fact until I blow holes in them...\"\n \n All due respect, but I've been lurking for a couple weeks getting my bearings before finally now posting and entering the fray. I've looked at a lot of threads. I have yet to see you blowing holes in anything. I'm sure you disagree. But what of that? I think they've won the day, and you don't realize it. Perhaps you don't want to realize it.\n \n Archangel: \"...then they will claim science is based on ever changing input which clarifies the end result.\"\n \n It is! Science is never final. If there's a better explanation of biological diversity than evolution out there, sooner or later, someone will find it, and sooner or later, it will supplant evolution. At present, neither Intelligent Design nor any other brand of creationism are anywhere close to that.\n \n Fallibilism is a big difference between science and religion -- or at least between science and fundamentalist religion.\n \n -----\n \n Archangel: \"But in real science, there are absolute laws of physics which dictate consistent and reliable outcome.\"\n \n Not true, on a number of points. First, I think it incorrect to equate \"physics\" with \"real science.\" Not that physics is a false science, mind you! But just because it's useful to study fundamental forces and particles in a given way, doesn't make that way the touchstone for studying more complex systems. This was a major failing of the philosophy of science in the late 19th and early 20th century: it kept taking physics as the model for everything, and not everything is so simple.\n \n Second, there is a great deal of question about what the \"laws\" of physics are. Whether they have any causal efficacy and can therefore \"dictate\" outcomes is a very controversial idea. These days, many philosophers and scientists would say that physical laws are just formulae that we human beings construct and use to understand nature. They in no way constrain nature itself, they merely enable our knowledge of it.\n \n Finally, laws of nature allow predictions about future observations, but those predictions are rarely 100% accurate. Which makes sense, because the observations from which they were derived weren't unanimous either. There are always little discrepancies here and there. (Or do you imagine that when Newton formulated the law of gravitation, all his observations fit it perfectly? Come on!) Even if they are causal -- which is, as noted, very much in question -- laws of nature are very far from \"dicating\" what happens.\n \n Archangel: \"But not in evo. That is as fluid as an ever changing fairy tale which must constantly adjust to answer for newly discovered evidence which conflicts with and contradicts prior assumptions.\"\n \n What, specifically, is the problem here? On the basis of new evidence, old assumptions are questioned. Why is that bad?\n \n -----\n \n Archangel: \"They [scientists] call 5,000 or 10,000 year old fossils are 200 and 300 million years old, and older.\"\n \n Please. If they have evidence that a fossil is only five or ten thousand years old, they call it five or ten thousand years old. If they have evidence that it's two or three hundred million years old, they call it two or three hundred million years old.\n \n Archangel: \"They have taken the same object and tested it 5 times with the same machine and come up with 5 different ages for it.\"\n \n And when that happens, they try to figure out which age is right. They also try to figure out why some of the results were wrong.\n \n Again, perhaps some specifics would help here.\n \n Archangel: \"They can't accurately allow for different rates of decay since they don't know the objects age before testing it. So the whole process is based on circular reasoning at its most basic level.\"\n \n What does \"different rates of decay\" mean? And how's it circular? A given radioactive isotope of carbon, say, has a particular decay rate. This rate can be ascertained independently of any fossils in which it might appear. I suppose it might vary with certain conditions, but those can also be ascertained independently of any particular fossil. And disparate conditions within a particular fossil can be accounted for. So where's the problem?\n \n -----\n \n Archangel: \"What I marvel at is allegedly intelligent, minds of analytical scientists can't see these obvious contradictions in their methodology.\"\n \n Spoken like Wonko the Sane: it's everyone else who's wrong, not you.\n \n Sorry, but that's the way I think of most creationists, and you are providing a wonderful case in point.\n \n -----\n \n Archangel: \"This requires spiritual discernment. Something the natural man could never relate to.\"\n \n And here, I think, is the root of our disagreement. You are claiming privileged access to a mode of knowledge that isn't available to others. Nothing could be further from how science operates.\n \n If you want to claim such a power that the great unwashed don't posses, fine. But for pity's sake, don't be surprised when they disagree with you, and don't waste your time trying to convince them to do otherwise.\n \n Seriously, I often wonder why creationists participate in these exchanges at all. Who are you trying to convince? Because on your very own view, you can't be trying to convince the natural man! Who, then? Who, indeed....\n \n -----\n \n Archangel: \"Every other belief system on Earth apart from Christ is a cult designed specifically to satisfy mans innate desire to worship God whild simultaneously leading men away from the living God. We are in a spiritual battle, but the natural man is clueless to the reality of this struggle between good and evil.\"\n \n And this sort of transparently self-serving exclusivism is exactly the problem with religious conservatism.\n \n Archangel: \"This is why the bible say's that \"'f we grope out into the darkness, God will find us' and \"'f we seek the truth, the truth will set us free'. It's also why each man must seek God personally and not rely on the word of others before committing to a so called religious commitment.\"\n \n But it's a rather strange version of \"everyone has to do it for themselves\" that then demands everyone to find the same \"it\" at the end of the search!\n \n Archangel: \"This might shock you but I hate religion. It is a man made concept which has led astray and corrupted countess people throughout history, many of the most powerful and most corrupted religious leaders in history have been popes who claimed to speak for God but never even knew Him personally.\"\n \n And I couldn't agree more! I just think that creationism is a prime example of a concept that corrupts.\n \n Archangel: \"So Christianity isn't a religion my friend, it's a relationship with a living God who created us in His image, with free will for willing fellowship with Him as His children who have the choice, but choose to be with Him.\"\n \n Maybe so, but what does that relationship have to do with literalism in the interpretation of the Biblical creation story? I regard creationism as textual idolatry, pure and simple.",

Lomu then correctly returned the challenge to where it should fall, to you.\nPoint of order here: you've made the assertion- it's now your responsibility to provide evidence for it.\n Either that, or retract.\nYou have done neither. Instead, you move the goal posts and offer nonsense that you don't understand.\n \nThe question is, if a process is reliable, why must a target date be submitted with a sample before testing?\nThat's not the question. The question is when and where was a single object tested 5 times by the same \"machine\" that resulted in 5 different ages? Please answer the question.\n \nWhy isn't blind testing done if the process is consistent and reliable?\nThe testing is blind. That just underlines your failure to educate yourself to understand the basics of what you oppose. When tests are done, the technicians doing the testing are not aware of the estimated age of the sample - it isn't a \"target date\", that's ignorant. Only after the dating is complete are the radiometric date and the submitted estimated date compared. That is what is reported to the customer.\n \n By the way, a \"target\" date isn't required. That's what creationist liars tell you, but creationists themselves have submitted many samples of many types for radiometric dating without such \"targets.\" That way they can claim that the dates are bogus. Dating labs rely on the ability of scientists to provide uncontaminated samples. Creationists have intentionally provided contaminated samples for dating so that they can claim that the whole process is unreliable (previously mentioned samples from Mount St. Helens).\n \n1. Carbon dating depends upon atmospheric carbon.\nNot exactly. Carbon dating depends on the ratio of C14 to C12. All living organisms take in carbon from their environment, and when they die, they no longer take in carbon. Thus, the C14 decays to N14 and the ratio changes as time goes by.\n \nThis is not always consistent,\nThat is true, but not for the reasons that you believe. You believe it because you have been duped. You have been told and you believe.\n \nand is partly related to sunspot cycles.\nActually, not so much. C14 is caused by cosmic radiation - not really radiation but energetic particles, mostly protons, that strike the atmosphere. Sunspots aren't the source of such particles. Solar flares are. But they are so short lived that they do not cause meaningful fluctuations in the levels of C14 in the atmosphere. In fact, the major cause of cosmic radiation is not the sun. The constant amount of extra solar and even extra galactic cosmic radiation reduces solar sources to insignificant amounts. Additionally, such solar fluctuations are so short lived that they have no impact on meaningful carbon dates. Such \"sun spot\" - actually solar flare - variations are well within the error bars of any such dating.\n \n2. Carbon dating tries to get verified via dendrochronology which results in a circular reasoning problem as I pointed out above.\nPure nonsense. It is apparent that you don't even know what circular reasoning is - a rather simple concept. Carbon dating is verified by the observed decay of C14 to N14 and the resulting change in the ratio of C14 to C12 in tested samples. This isn't a matter of belief. It is an observed fact. The problem is that carbon levels in the atmosphere do change and have changed through time. Even though we can estimate an age based on a comparison with current ratios of carbon in the atmosphere, we know that those ages are a bit off because of the varying levels of carbon in the atmosphere. But dendrochronology isn't used to \"verify\" carbon dating. It is used to calibrate it. The ratio of the tested sample is compared to the ratio of known tree ring samples, and an age (with error bars) is established.\n \n In fact, varves in deep lakes have been carbon dated, just as ancient tree rings were dated, and radiocarbon dating has been calibrated back some 45,000 years. The first 10,000 years of calibration from varves did, in fact, verify dendrochronology.\n \n3. Carbon dating can give so many different results for even one sample that a target date is required to be submitted by most labs.\nBut why aren't creationists \"required\" to submit a \"target\" date? Please give some examples of these differing results for carbon dating. You make yet another unsupported assertion. You read it on a creationist site and you got duped. Please don't try to move the goal posts again. Give us verified examples (they don't need to be on the Internet - I can go to libraries) of these multiple age results. I suspect that you are going to attempt to dupe us as you have been duped by citing a creationist web site that duped you because you \"believe.\" I am actually asking for published scientific literature to support your \"belief.\"\n \n4. Compared to historical dates, carbon dating is systematically too young from about 100 BC back to about 2600 BC\nIs that so? Are you saying that the dates that Biblical scholars and Biblical archaeologists are claiming for Biblical events are wrong? Wow! I was under the impression that Biblical scholars had used carbon dating to verify certain historical events that were reported in the historical books of the Bible. What exactly do you mean by \"historical dates\"?\n \n5. There are known examples of wild discrepancies in carbon dating because of environmental circumstances. Carbon absorption from the environment varies significantly.\nThat's nonsense. Your \"wild discrepancies\" are known because they have been investigated by scientists, not by creationists. Such cases are well known and are not dated by radiocarbon dating. In fact, carbon absorption from the environment is quite consistent in any given environment. It is well known that in some environments the carbon source is quite old, thus resulting in an erroneous age. Creationists somehow think that these few examples somehow support the mythology of the origin of everything about 6,000 years ago.\n \n Isn't it sad that creationism depends on the misrepresentation of actual science.\n \nThose are a fast five reasons.\nBut your reasons are nonsense and you haven't answered the question.\n \nThere are others but plenty of material is on the web.\nBut anyone can post any sort of stupidity on the web. How does that make it real? Why do creationists demand links to web pages for support and reject references to scientific papers published in scientific journals (available in any good library) or books written by scientists about their field? Chances are that a creationist wouldn't actually read a book in an effort to educate himself.\n \nAnd every dating method has its own problems. Here's an explanation of why all dating methods have their own unique problems. Keep scrolling down to the next section for problems with K-ar dating method specifically.\nI don't understand. Please explain it to me. Please assume that I know nothing and begin with the basics of K/Ar dating. Why do scientists assume that it works and why do creationists assume that it doesn't? Why is you link to a creationist web site the has duped you reliable in the real world? \n \n Finally, what does K/Ar dating have to do with radiocarbon dating that has been the topic of this discussion? Is it that you don't actually know the difference? Or is it that you are attempting to move tho goal posts again?\n \n Wouldn't it be nice if you actually made an effort to educate yourself before speaking?",

   "Archangel: \"They [scientists] call 5,000 or 10,000 year old fossils are 200 and 300 million years old, and older.\"\n \n Please. If they have evidence that a fossil is only five or ten thousand years old, they call it five or ten thousand years old. If they have evidence that it's two or three hundred million years old, they call it two or three hundred million years old.\n\n \n That's the whole point, their evidence is faulty. \n \n \nArchangel: \"They have taken the same object and tested it 5 times with the same machine and come up with 5 different ages for it.\"\n \n And when that happens, they try to figure out which age is right. They also try to figure out why some of the results were wrong.\n \n Again, perhaps some specifics would help here.\n\n \n Sure, tree ring dating is a popular exercise because in many cases the age of the tree can be independently determined with the tree rings. In 2002, Rod Savidge, a PHD had this to say:\n Consider also the frustration of Rod A. Savidge Ph.D. Savidge is a professor of tree physiology/biochemistry, Forestry, and Environmental Management at the University of New Brunswick. He vented the following interesting comments regarding the science of dendrochronology, published in a Letter to the Editor in the New York Times, November of 2002: \n \n \"As a tree physiologist who has devoted his career to understanding how trees make wood, I have made sufficient observations on tree rings and cambial growth to know that dendrochronology is not at all an exact science. Indeed, its activities include subjective interpretations of what does and what does not constitute an annual ring, statistical manipulation of data to fulfill subjective expectations, and discarding of perfectly good data sets when they contradict other data sets that have already been accepted. Such massaging of data cannot by any stretch of the imagination be considered science; it merely demonstrates a total lack of rigor attending so-called dendrochronology 'research' . . . It would be a major step forward if dendrochronology could embrace the scientific method.\" 25\n \n \n I personally find it most interesting that tree-ring specialists do not and historically have not actually subjected their judgments to potential falsification - to include Ferguson. For example, while Ferguson was still alive, he never allowed anyone to analyze his original data or the basis for the many suppositions that went into the establishment of his chronology. So, Ferguson's chronologies were not subjected to the normal rigors of science and thus should not be accepted as scientifically credible. Surprisingly, modern dendrochronologists are not all that much better about revealing their data either.10 \n Beyond this, even where dendrochronology is accepted as reliable, there are problems. For example, there seems to be close agreement between the standard decay curve of carbon 14 and the dendro-calibration for the last 2,500 years. However, around 500 B.C. the two curves begin to diverge so that by 4,000 years before present (BP) the gap is 250 years and by 7,000 BP the gap is 630 years. In addition, consider the question that if carbon 14 dating is calibrated by tree ring analysis could carbon 14 be used to validate tree ring analysis? This would be a form of circular reasoning - right? And yet this very thing is done all the time. Whenever there is a discrepancy in building a dendrochronological sequence, carbon 14 is used to choose the \"correct\" match. Sometimes this \"correct\" match is not the best statistical match, but it is chosen anyway because it has the best agreement with the established paradigm of the day. 22 Radiocarbon Dating\n \n \nArchangel: \"They can't accurately allow for different rates of decay since they don't know the objects age before testing it. So the whole process is based on circular reasoning at its most basic level.\"\n \n What does \"different rates of decay\" mean? And how's it circular? A given radioactive isotope of carbon, say, has a particular decay rate. This rate can be ascertained independently of any fossils in which it might appear. I suppose it might vary with certain conditions, but those can also be ascertained independently of any particular fossil. And disparate conditions within a particular fossil can be accounted for. So where's the problem?\n\n \n Here's the rub though; decay rates can vary depending on the conditions that existed at the time they were exposed to the elements. This is the very process by which they are relevant in determining the object in questions age. So by using a standardized decay rate formula, the results are obviously based on totally subjective input since it's difficult, if not impossible to determine the precise radioactive influences at the time the object was deposited. It requires very subjective and even circular reasoning since standardized decay rates are being applied to objects before actually knowing the approximate age of the object being tested.\n \n -----\n \n \nArchangel: \"This might shock you but I hate religion. It is a man made concept which has led astray and corrupted countess people throughout history, many of the most powerful and most corrupted religious leaders in history have been popes who claimed to speak for God but never even knew Him personally.\"\n \n And I couldn't agree more! I just think that creationism is a prime example of a concept that corrupts.\n \n Archangel: \"So Christianity isn't a religion my friend, it's a relationship with a living God who created us in His image, with free will for willing fellowship with Him as His children who have the choice, but choose to be with Him.\"\n \n Maybe so, but what does that relationship have to do with literalism in the interpretation of the Biblical creation story? I regard creationism as textual idolatry, pure and simple.\n\n \n Everything. If the Genesis account is false then the whole bible is a mythical story with no real relevance to humanities fall from grace and eventual redemption through Jesus sacrifice on the Cross. If you really understood the consistency of the bible, you would understand this. For example: In Corinthians in the NT, Paul speaks to this issue precisely here:\n 1Cr 15:45 And so it is written, \"The first man Adam became a living being.\" [fn] The last Adam [became] a life-giving spirit.\n \n 1Cr 15:46 However, the spiritual is not first, but the natural, and afterward the spiritual.\n \n 1Cr 15:47 The first man [was] of the earth, [made] of dust; the second Man [is] the Lord [fn] from heaven.\n \n 1Cr 15:48 As [was] the [man] of dust, so also [are] those [who are] [made] of dust; and as [is] the heavenly [Man], so also [are] those [who are] heavenly.\n \n 1Cr 15:49 And as we have borne the image of the [man] of dust, we shall also bear [fn] the image of the heavenly [Man].\n \n 1Cr 15:50 Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; nor does corruption inherit incorruption.there is more past verse 50 if you want to continue reading:\n \n So this is the process by which we were created and fell from grace through Adam, and by which we were reunited to God through Christ. It is a spiritual reconnection, which goes beyond the understanding of the natural man. Which is why the natural man is blind to the reality of the supernatural world which exists all around them. So if Genesis is a lie, allegory or myth, and Man evolved from lower life forms, then the nature of sin is bogus, as is our fall from grace and subsequent need for reconciliation to God. \n \n That means that their was no need for Jesus to come and die for our sins, then the gospel of salvation is an unnecessary fraud. So if evolution is correct, no matter how pseudo christians attempt to marry the two belief systems, if Christ did not rise from the dead, the gospel is useless and our faith is in vain as Paul put it so eloquently.\n \n Also, when I made this point above, it went right over your head as you responded that it is fine for me, but it will take more than my sincere belief to convince you of it. You said that in response to me telling you that in order to discover God, each of us must reach out to Him personally by faith, that if He is there, He will reveal Himself to you. All Man can offer you is religious belief; only God can give you regenerative spiritual life. And that new life can only come through Jesus who is the perfect lamb of God who personally took every sin you ever committed upon Himself on the Cross. There is no other way to be redeemed apart from Him. Whether you accept it or not.",

If you want your opponents to take you seriously, return the favor by not wasting their time.\n \n In the interests of being pro-active about not wasting too much time myself, here are some thoughts about a few sentences from your reply.\n \n You: \"If the Genesis account is false then the whole bible is a mythical story with no real relevance to humanities fall from grace and eventual redemption through Jesus sacrifice on the Cross.\"\n \n If Genesis is literally false, that does not prevent the Bible (in whole or in part) from expressing profound truths about humanity's relationship to God, our place in the universe, human nature, or the foundations of morality. The idea that one must regard religious stories as literally true in order to find them at all spiritually meaningful is simply false.\n \n You: \"If you really understood the consistency of the bible, you would understand this.\"\n \n I actually understand the consistency of the Bible quite well, thanks. If you can literalize yet reconcile the two separate accounts of the order of creation in Genesis 1 and Genesis 2, by all means, do so. The citations from Paul certainly don't accomplish this.\n \n You: \"So this is the process by which we were created and fell from grace through Adam, and by which we were reunited to God through Christ. It is a spiritual reconnection, which goes beyond the understanding of the natural man. Which is why the natural man is blind to the reality of the supernatural world which exists all around them.\"\n \n And if the natural man is so blind, and you cannot hope to convince him, then I repeat: just whom are you trying to convince? In the immortal words of philosopher Martin Blank: \"Who do you wanna hit, man? It isn't me.\"\n \n You: \"So if Genesis is a lie, allegory or myth, and Man evolved from lower life forms, then the nature of sin is bogus, as is our fall from grace and subsequent need for reconciliation to God.

So if evolution is correct, no matter how pseudo christians attempt to marry the two belief systems, if Christ did not rise from the dead, the gospel is useless and our faith is in vain as Paul put it so eloquently.\"\n \n Why? I mean, look, leave aside the fact that just about nothing is as subjective as interpreting the Bible, and that many would thus no doubt take issue with your interpretation. How would evolution's truth and Genesis' (literal) falsity make sin \"bogus\" or salvation a \"fraud?\" Are we not still sinners in need of salvation? Please explain.",

   "Here's the rub though; decay rates can vary depending on the conditions that existed at the time they were exposed to the elements.\n\n \nWell, sorta, but not enough to do your case any good...\n\n Actually, Archy said that decay rates vary depending on conditions \"at the time they were exposed to the elements.\" Not even remotely correct. While the rates of decay of certain elements and decay types can be altered (at least hypothetically) it has nothing to do with \"exposure to the elements\" in the sense that Archy means. For the most part, conditions that would change decay rates don't even exist on earth - never have. So it doesn't matter when the C14 was formed, it's half life is the same at low pressure, high pressure, and in whatever chemical compound. That's the point.\n \n And of course, we are still waiting for Archy to back up his bizarre claim, \"They have taken the same object and tested it 5 times with the same machine and come up with 5 different ages for it.\"\n \n It is also pretty evident from Archy's discussions that he doesn't know the difference between radiocarbon dating and radiometric dating. A couple of times in discussions of radiocarbon dating he has mentioned ages of millions of years. And I'm sure that Archy doesn't even know how radiocarbon dating works, or any other type of radiometric dating. Remember, he said, \"They can't accurately allow for different rates of decay since they don't know the objects age before testing it. So the whole process is based on circular reasoning at its most basic level.\"\n \n Another example of Archy arguing about a topic without having the integrity to learn at least the basics.",

   "I'm not going to stoop to your level guys, because I realize you must insult my intelligence in order to build yourselves up. And I also know that we will never agree as you will always remain in denial regarding the problems with your so called science. So here are examples of where uniformitarian dating systems of various types, and the errors they produce, with sources. Of course as a standard practice, neither evolutionists nor radiometric testers publish their erroneous or faulty results so they are hard to come by. \n \n In 1968 scientists dated the rocks of a Hawaiian volcano called Hualalai, using Potassium/Argon radiometric techniques. They knew that the volcano had erupted in 1800 and that the rocks were around 170 years old, but the ages they determined ranged from 160 million to 3 billion. This method of dating rocks obviously produces erroneous ages, and should not be used to factually age the earth and its geology. Journal of Geophysical Research, Vol. 73, No. 14, 1968 p:4601-4607\n \n Different radioactive dating methods used on volcanic rock samples from Reunion Island (Indian Ocean) gave conflicting results that varied from 100,000 to 4.4 billion years. Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta, Vol. 35, 1971 p:261-288 & Vol. 36, 1972 p:1167\n \n A living water snail taken from an artesian spring in Nevada was given an assessed age of 27,000 years.

Antarctic Journal of the United States, Vol. 6, October, 1971 p:210+\n \n A freshly killed seal was assessed at 1,300 old. Antarctic Journal of the United States, Vol. 6, October, 1971 p:210+\n \n 15,000 year difference appeared in the assessment of samples from a single sample block of peat.\n New Zealand Journal of Geology and Geophysics, Vol. 21, No. 4, 1978 p:463-466\n \n Radiometric dating of fossil skull 1470 show that the various methods do not give accurate measurements of ages. The first tests gave an age of 221 million years. The second, 2.4 million years. Subsequent tests gave ages which ranged from 290,000 to 19.5 million years. Palaeomagnetic determinations gave an age of 3 million years. All these readings give a 762 fold error in the age calculations. Given that only errors less than 10% (0.1 fold) are acceptable in scientific calculations, these readings show that radiometric assessment should never ever be used. John Reader, \"Missing Links\", BCA/Collins: London, 1981 p:206-209PICK ANY THEORY YOU LIKE\n \n Most dating methods are based on the uniformitarian method. This method measures rates of change and estimates age. There are over 80 ways of dating the earth and these ages range from 400 years total to over 100 billion. Such a wide variety of possibilities makes it impossible to tell for certain the age of the earth using that method. You can just pick and choose the date that fits your theories. This is not scientific at all. It's guessing.\n \n For the last 150 years, the age of the Earth according to evolutionists has been doubling at roughly a rate of once every 15 years. In fact, since 1900 this age has multiplied by a factor of 100! But, over 50 of the 80 methods show that the earth, solar system, and universe are young than 1 million years old. This makes evolution impossible.\n \n Here's one example with volcanoes. Volcanoes eject almost a cubic mile of material into the atmosphere each year. At this rapid rate, about 10 times the entire volume of the earths sedimentary rock should be produced in 4.6 billion years. Actually, only about 25% of the earth's sediments are of volcanic origin, and much greater volcanic activity existed in the past. No means have been proposed which can remove or transform all these volcanic sediments. Earth's sediments, therefore, appear to be much younger than 4.6 billion years old. In addition, fuming volcanoes are known to produce around 500 gm of gold per day in the fluids coming out of them. This is the equivalent of 18 tonnes of gold per century from just one volcano. New Scientist, November 5, 1994 p:6 (we should gave quite an incredible amount of gold...MUCH more than we do from billions of years ages...another proof of a young earth)\n \n DATES THAT DON'T MATCH THE THEORY ARE DISCARDED\n \n A. Hayatsu (Department of Geophysics, University of Western Ontario, Canada), \"K-Ar isochron age of the North Mountain Basalt, Nova Scotia\",-Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences, vol. 16, 1979,-\"In conventional interpretation of K-Ar (potassium/argon dating method) age data, it is common to discard ages which are substantially too high or too low compared with the rest of the group or with other available data such as the geological time scale. The discrepancies between the rejected and the accepted are arbitrarily-attributed to excess or loss of argon.\" In other words the potassium/argon (K/Ar) method doesn't support the uranium/lead (U/Pb) method.\n \n Richard L. Mauger, Ph.D. (Associate Professor of Geology, East Carolina University, USA), Contributions to Geology, University of Wyoming, vol. 15 (1), 1977, p. 37.-\"In general, dates in the 'correct ball park' are assumed to be correct and are published, but those in disagreement with other data are seldom published nor are discrepancies fully explained.\"Carbon Dating: The Technique \n Carbon Dating is a controversial dating technique. The method is based on the rate of decay of the radioactive carbon isotope, Carbon-14, which is formed in the upper atmosphere through the effect of cosmic ray neutrons upon Nitrogen-14. The Carbon-14 is rapidly oxidized and enters the earth's organic life through photosynthesis (plants) and the food chain (animals). Carbon-14 also enters the earth's oceans in an atmospheric exchange and as dissolved carbonate. Plants and animals, which utilize carbon in organic functions and food chains, absorb Carbon-14 during their lifetimes. The assumption is that the earth-bound carbon exists in equilibrium with the Carbon-14 in the atmosphere, which means that the number of Carbon-14 atoms and non-radioactive carbon atoms stays approximately the same over time. As soon as a plant or animal dies, it ceases its carbon intake. Thereafter, there is no replenishment of radioactive Carbon-14, only decay. In 1949, a team of scientists led by Willard Libby of the University of Chicago discovered that this decay occurs at a constant rate. They found that after 5,568 years, half the Carbon-14 in a dead sample will decay, and after another 5,568 years, half of that remaining Carbon-14 will decay, and so on. Thus, the \"half-life\" for Carbon-14 was measured by Libby and his team at 5,568?0 years. After ten half-lives, there is a miniscule amount of radioactive carbon left in a sample, which means that the limit of the Carbon Dating method is reached at between 50,000 and 60,000 years.\n \n Carbon Dating: The Controversy \n Carbon dating is controversial in that it shares some of the fundamental assumptions inherent to all Radiometric Dating techniques. In order for Carbon Dating to have any value, Carbon-14, produced in our outer atmosphere as Nitrogen-14 and changed into radioactive Carbon-14 by cosmic-ray bombardment, must be at equilibrium in our atmosphere. That is, the production rate must be equal to the decay rate. Based on the mathematics inherent in Libby's research, it takes approximately 30,000 years of Carbon-14 build up from a zero concentration level to reach this state of equilibrium. Recent studies indicate that Carbon-14 has not yet reached equilibrium in our atmosphere, thus indicating that the atmosphere is not yet 30,000 years old.\n \n Carbon Dating: The Use Of Dendrochronology \n Carbon Dating advocates have turned to Dendrochronology (tree ring dating) to help solve the \"equilibrium\" dilemma. They claim that Dendrochronology allows them to determine past concentration levels of Carbon-14 in the atmosphere, by measuring the Carbon-14 to Carbon-12 ratios in tree rings. The problem is that no trees have been shown to exceed 4,500 years in age. The Methuselah Tree in Southern California has been called the oldest living tree, and it has been dated at approximately 4,500 years. Carbon Dating advocates use tree rings from dead trees thought to overlap the Methuselah Tree to mathematically determine ages exceeding 4,500 years. They determine whether a dead tree's age overlaps the Methuselah Tree's age by ring patterns, and then they assume that the dead trees are older through a comparison of ring patterns, carbon ratios, etc. There seems to be an illogical methodology here. To complicate matters, tree ring patterns are typically inconsistent. Even living trees can show dissimilar patterns caused by differing soil nutrients, direction of prevailing sunlight, fire history, distance to water sources, etc.\n \n Carbon Dating: What Do The Experts Think? \n Carbon Dating can best be summed-up with the following statement by T. Save-Sodebergh and I.U. Olsson (Institute of Egyptology and Institute of Physics, respectively, University of Uppsala, Sweden) in their publication, C-14 Dating and Egyptian Chronology in Radiocarbon: \"If a C-14 date supports our theories, we put it in the main text. If it does not entirely contradict them, we put it in a footnote. And if it is completely 'out of date' we just drop it.\" This illustrates the fact that accepted carbon dates are not necessarily accurate dates -- they are merely selected dates. \"It should be no surprise, then, that fully half of the dates are rejected. The wonder is, surely, that the remaining half come to be accepted\" (Robert E. Lee, \"Radiocarbon, Ages in Error,\" Anthropological Journal of Canada, Vol. 19, No.3, 1981, pp.9, 29).Carbon dating",

   "Hi Lomu, welcome to the forum, I think. Here are 5 problems I have with Carbon dating. The question is, if a process is reliable, why must a target date be submitted with a sample before testing? Why isn't blind testing done if the process is consistent and reliable? \n \n 1. Carbon dating depends upon atmospheric carbon. This is not always consistent, and is partly related to sunspot cycles.\n 2. Carbon dating tries to get verified via dendrochronology which results in a circular reasoning problem as I pointed out above.\n 3. Carbon dating can give so many different results for even one sample that a target date is required to be submitted by most labs. \n 4. Compared to historical dates, carbon dating is systematically too young from about 100 BC back to about 2600 BC\n 5. There are known examples of wild discrepancies in carbon dating because of environmental circumstances. Carbon absorption from the environment varies significantly.\n \n Those are a fast five reasons. There are others but plenty of material is on the web. And every dating method has its own problems. Here's an explanation of why all dating methods have their own unique problems. Keep scrolling down to the next section for problems with K-ar dating method specifically. \n \n - Radiometric Dating Game -\n\n \n Have you reviewed the \"RATE project\" yet?",

Any basic astronomy textbook could present you with the evidence, as could uncountable other sources.\n \n \nI have heard of NO science that would indicate to me that the earth is millions of years old.\n\n \n Then again I hate to be blunt, but you haven't been listening very hard. There's plenty out there. Here a basic earth sciences textbook would help. (And some of them include discussions of earth's place in the universe, so you might be able to address the first issue, too, if you pick your textbook wisely.)\n \n Actually, there's a readable and enjoyable discussion of these issues, and of much else besides, in Bill Bryson's Short History of Everything. (I think that's the title; I just looked on my shelf and for some reason can't find it.) Bryson is not a scientist himself, the book is written with a lay audience in mind, and he insistently keeps asking \"How do they know that?\" I highly recommend it.\n \n \nOnly 'theories' not evidence.\n\n \n This seems to be the typical misunderstanding of the word \"theory\" in a scientific context. It doesn't mean speculation. Nor does it mean hypothesis.\n \n In fact, the currently accepted hypotheses about the age of the universe and of the earth are very well corroborated by scads of evidence.

   "I'm not going to stoop to your level guys, because I realize you must insult my intelligence...\nSince it obviously has not and most likely will not serve any purpose to address Archy himself, I'm going to stop doing so. Generally, one enters into a discussion on this board in an effort to educate someone. That is fruitless in this case. So far, correcting errors of fact by Archy has only resulted in comments like the above. Thus, my responses are to the board in the hope that at least someone will learn or find some resources for learning.\n \nIn 1968 scientists dated the rocks of a Hawaiian volcano called Hualalai, using Potassium/Argon radiometric techniques. They knew that the volcano had erupted in 1800 and that the rocks were around 170 years old, but the ages they determined ranged from 160 million to 3 billion. This method of dating rocks obviously produces erroneous ages, and should not be used to factually age the earth and its geology. Journal of Geophysical Research, Vol. 73, No. 14, 1968 p:4601-4607\nIt would be nice if Archy would correctly cited research papers. This is a case of an intentional lie by Henry Morris that has been repeated by similar liars and dupes for years. Hawaiian lava is relatively cool and it includes pieces of unmelted rock. These are known as xenoliths. The scientists in question didn't date the lava but the xenoliths. Their purpose was to show that xenoliths could not be used to date lava flows. Only creationists are dumb enough to believe that the scientists were claiming that the dates were reliable.\n \nDifferent radioactive dating methods used on volcanic rock samples from Reunion Island (Indian Ocean) gave conflicting results that varied from 100,000 to 4.4 billion years. Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta, Vol. 35, 1971 p:261-288 & Vol. 36, 1972 p:1167\nAbsolute hogwash. The dating methods used in the two papers (incorrectly) cited was K/Ar dating. Lava flows from the oldest island dated to 2 m.y., 1.2-1.0 m.y., 0.55-0.43 m.y., and 0.35-0.07 m.y. The dates from the youngest island revealed continuous activity from about 0.36 m.y. Some investigation was done concerning U/Pb domains but no extraneous dates were found. The varying dates were caused by dating distinct flows. Any difference in dates was not because of \"conflicting results\", but from the dating of separate periods of activity. Only creationists think that all lava from a 2 m.y. old volcano should have the same date.\n \nA living water snail taken from an artesian spring in Nevada was given an assessed age of 27,000 years. Science, Vol. 224, April 6, 1984 p:58-61\nNo it wasn't. That's just the creationists misrepresentation of the facts. The source of the carbon in the snail shells was the water of the spring, which ran through very old rock and thus had dissolved HCO3 from very old biogenic sources. In other words, the source of the carbon in the snail shells was not the atmosphere.\n \nShell from living clams was 'dated' thousands of years old. Science, Vol. 141, August 16, 1963 p:634\nSame reason as the one above. The \n source of the carbon was not the atmosphere but very old biogenic carbon.\n \nDried seal carcasses less than 30 years old were 'dated' as 4,600 years old. Antarctic Journal of the United States, Vol. 6, October, 1971 p:210+\nI wonder what the primary source of carbon was for these seals.\n \nA freshly killed seal was assessed at 1,300 old. Antarctic Journal of the United States, Vol. 6, October, 1971 p:210+\nSeems to be a problem with marine animals, doesn't it? Could it be that their sourced of carbon might be the marine diet that gets carbon from dissolved carbon from HCO3?\n \nRadiometric dating of fossil skull 1470 show that the various methods do not give accurate measurements of ages. The first tests gave an age of 221 million years. The second, 2.4 million years. Subsequent tests gave ages which ranged from 290,000 to 19.5 million years. Palaeomagnetic determinations gave an age of 3 million years. All these readings give a 762 fold error in the age calculations. Given that only errors less than 10% (0.1 fold) are acceptable in scientific calculations, these readings show that radiometric assessment should never ever be used. John Reader, \"Missing Links\", BCA/Collins: London, 1981 p:206-209\nBut fossils aren't directly dated. They can't be. What method of dating was used on KNM ER 1470?\n \n Let's just skip the rest of the post. It's just an intentional effort to deceive with half truths and outright lies. Instead, I recommend that anyone interested refer to Tim Thompson's page on Radiometric dating, or that he read G. Brent Dalrymple's book, The Age of the Earth.",

They are as valid as your claims which are derived from the different dating systems you rely on to make your claims regarding the age of the Earth and life on it.

The first tests gave an age of 221 million years. The second, 2.4 million years. Subsequent tests gave ages which ranged from 290,000 to 19.5 million years.

John Reader, \"Missing Links\", BCA/Collins: London, 1981 p:206-209\n And he rightly points out that:\n But fossils aren't directly dated. It's the rock around them which is dated. But according to you all, the Earth is over 4 billion years old. If you buried any animal five hundred years ago in direct contact with the Earth, and excavated it today, if its bones survived that time in direct contact with the earth at all, and you tested the earth around it, do you actually think it would reflect a buried age of 500 years? How could it when the Earth it is buried in was so much older on the day the body was deposited? \n \n The question is, how do you rely on results which claim ages for fossils based on the age of its surrounding rock which we all know is much older than the bones found in it? Even if your dating methods were absolutely accurate, how can you derive the age of the bones from it? Now I realize that I will once again be accused of just not getting it or understanding the process, and that science attempts to answer this question, but I find the answer seriously wanting.\n \n And one more thing. The quote from my post shows that multiple tests were done on the same fossil evidence and every result was different. Of course that fact was ignored as he focussed on the implication that they tested the fossil itself rather than using the standardized methodology which the process requires. Here's my evidence:\n 1470 Skull And Radiometric Dating \n \n Many people think radioactive dating gives a \n foolproof method of finding a rock's age. \n Richard Leakey's experience with skull 1470 \n shows otherwise. \n The fossil skull known as 1470 was found by \n Richard Leakey in 1972 in Kenya. It has \n proved a difficult skull to date. When Leakey \n made his find, he believed the skull was about \n 2.6 million years old. So he sent samples of \n the rock in which 1470 was found to Cam- \n bridge, England, for dating.1 Tests on these \n first samples gave an average age not of 2.6 \n million years, but of an incredible 221 million \n years!2 This was more than 218 million years \n too great! \n The scientists who did the dating decided the \n rock they had tested must have been contami- \n nated. So Leakey sent more samples. From \n these the scientists chose crystals that \n seemed fresher than others, and they came \n up with an age of 2.4 million years. (They \n later adjusted this to 2.6 million years, plus or \n minus 260,000 years, which agreed well with \n Leakey's belief before dating tests even \n began.) \n But dating work on the rock did not stop \n there.3 More samples were taken. More tests \n were done. Results this time ranged from \n 290,000 years up to 19.5 million years! \n Trying to bring some sense to the results, \n paleomagnetic determinations were begun.4 \n Leakey's 1470 fossil was then given an age of \n three million years. But this date drew \n opposition from palaeontologists who said it \n conflicted with the age of animal fossils from \n the region. Then Dr. Garniss Curtiss, from the \n University of California at Berkeley, said his \n potassium/argon tests dated the rock at 1.8 \n million years. \n Is radioactive dating reliable? Ask Richard \n Leakey. He was given dates ranging from \n 290,000 years to 221 million years for his \n 1470 skull, using the supposedly reliable \n potassium/argon method. \n (Based on information in Missing Links, by \n John Reader, BCA/Collins, London, 1981, pp. \n 206-209.)http://www.cai.org/files/theme-sheets/en/c/sc0028au.pdf\n \n As everyone can now see, Pandions attack on me accusing my source of testing the bone rather than the surrounding rock with his diatribe which explained the obvious, in opposition to no incorrect claims made by my original link has been shown to be completely erroneous. This also clarifies that multiple samples from the same rock was tested multiple times, and each time producing different results which should finally shut penfold and pandion up as they crawl back into their holes of self denial.",

   "PZ just happened to write a post on his blog today about the \"interpretation\" argument creationists have been peddling a lot lately, and the very end happens to mention the RATE project, actually. The final paragraph sums up just how dumb the conclusions are:\n \n \nAnd please, when your presuppositions lead to ridiculous assertions, it's time to question your premises. One of the examples this silly AiG article uses to justify its peculiar relativism is the interpretation of dating methods. Can you see the glaring problem in this rationale from the disgracefully sloppy work of Russell Humphreys?\n \n \nConsider the research from the creationist RATE group (Radioisotopes and the Age of The Earth) concerning the age of zircon crystals in granite. Using one set of assumptions, these crystals could be interpreted to be around 1.5 billion years old based on the amount of lead produced from the decay of uranium (which also produces helium). However, if one questions these assumptions, one is motivated to test them. Measurements of the rate at which helium is able to \"leak out\" of these crystals indicate that if they were much older than about 6,000 years, they would have nowhere near the amount of helium still left in them. Hence, the originally applied assumption of a constant decay rate is flawed; one must assume, instead, that there has been acceleration of the decay rate in the past. Using this revised assumption, the same uranium-lead data can now be interpreted to also give an age of fewer than 6,000 years.\n\n \n Using their Biblical presupposition, they need to explain away the evidence of the accumulation of radioactive decay products by assuming that decay rates were roughly one million fold greater in the recent past. They are making a \"revised assumption\" that would mean that the planet should have exploded into a great glowing cloud of hot vapor a few thousand years ago! Shouldn't that sort of compel you to rethink your excuses? But no, these guys just sail past the glaring contradiction with empirical reality as if it didn't exist.\n",

Subsequent tests gave ages which ranged from 290,000 to 19.5 million years. Palaeomagnetic determinations gave an age of 3 million years. All these readings give a 762 fold error in the age calculations.

Then I post a second link below which even though it goes on to point out that it was the rock surrounding the fossil which was tested, the title of the piece is \"1470 Skull And Radiometric Dating \" IT'S NOT TITLED \"THE ROCK AROUND SKULL 1470 AND RADIOMETRIC DATING\" The reason for that is because the object of the testing is the skull and not the rock. But you must focus on making the most damming assumptions which are completely erroneous regarding the claim my links make, and of course you are also attempting to attribute them to me directly as if I personally made these mistakes; which aren't mistakes at all as my most recent link exposes. \n \n \nMy so called allegations are no different than any of your alleged refutations of them. They are as valid as your claims which are derived from the different dating systems you rely on to make your claims regarding the age of the Earth and life on it. But let me point out the irrationality of your sides reasoning with one of the completely fallacious points Pandion made in his attempt to refute me. \n \n I posted this:\n Radiometric dating of fossil skull 1470 show that the various methods do not give accurate measurements of ages. The first tests gave an age of 221 million years. The second, 2.4 million years. Subsequent tests gave ages which ranged from 290,000 to 19.5 million years.

The quote from my post shows that multiple tests were done on the same fossil evidence and every result was different. Of course that fact was ignored as he focussed on the implication that they tested the fossil itself rather than using the standardized methodology which the process requires. Here's my evidence:\n 1470 Skull And Radiometric Dating \n \n Many people think radioactive dating gives a \n foolproof method of finding a rock's age. \n Richard Leakey's experience with skull 1470 \n shows otherwise. \n The fossil skull known as 1470 was found by \n Richard Leakey in 1972 in Kenya. It has \n proved a difficult skull to date. When Leakey \n made his find, he believed the skull was about \n 2.6 million years old. So he sent samples of \n the rock in which 1470 was found to Cam- \n bridge, England, for dating.1 Tests on these \n first samples gave an average age not of 2.6 \n million years, but of an incredible 221 million \n years!2 This was more than 218 million years \n too great! \n The scientists who did the dating decided the \n rock they had tested must have been contami- \n nated. So Leakey sent more samples. From \n these the scientists chose crystals that \n seemed fresher than others, and they came \n up with an age of 2.4 million years. (They \n later adjusted this to 2.6 million years, plus or \n minus 260,000 years, which agreed well with \n Leakey's belief before dating tests even \n began.) \n But dating work on the rock did not stop \n there.3 More samples were taken. More tests \n were done. Results this time ranged from \n 290,000 years up to 19.5 million years! \n Trying to bring some sense to the results, \n paleomagnetic determinations were begun.4 \n Leakey's 1470 fossil was then given an age of \n three million years. But this date drew \n opposition from palaeontologists who said it \n conflicted with the age of animal fossils from \n the region. Then Dr. Garniss Curtiss, from the \n University of California at Berkeley, said his \n potassium/argon tests dated the rock at 1.8 \n million years. \n Is radioactive dating reliable? Ask Richard \n Leakey. He was given dates ranging from \n 290,000 years to 221 million years for his \n 1470 skull, using the supposedly reliable \n potassium/argon method. \n (Based on information in Missing Links, by \n John Reader, BCA/Collins, London, 1981, pp. \n 206-209.)http://www.cai.org/files/theme-sheets/en/c/sc0028au.pdf\n \n As everyone can now see, Pandions attack on me accusing my source of testing the bone rather than the surrounding rock with his diatribe which explained the obvious, in opposition to no incorrect claims made by my original link has been shown to be completely erroneous. This also clarifies that multiple samples from the same rock was tested multiple times, and each time producing different results which should finally shut penfold and pandion up as they crawl back into their holes of self denial.\n\n \n \nBut that's not what you said. Now that your error has been pointed out, you seem to have a better, but not correct, grasp of what it said.\n\n \n MY QUOTES, both of them referred to skull 1470 being tested because that was the object of the testing. Only you are disingenuous enough to first attribute that as an error at all, as if the first was claiming the skull and not the rock around it was tested. And then continue to attribute it to me as if it was my statement and not the quoted statement I posted. My second link, an article, clearly shows the process of sending rock samples which surrounded the skull since it's more than a quote from the story and you now claim this is not what I said earlier. You are still attempting to purposely misinterpret what my earlier quote said when you know all too well what they were really referring to in their statement. \n \n It just shows that you will go out of your way to misinterpret the info I post in order to use it as a weapon to attack my intelligence with, rather than respond to what it's actually saying about the flaws in the dating process which was the reason for posting that info in the first place. My second link went into detail regarding skull 1470 and you completely ignored that in favor of staying with defending your original erroneous claim as if they were referring to testing the skull itself and not the rocks around it in the first quote.\n \n Also, regarding every question I asked regarding how you can expect to get an accurate age date for a fossil by testing the much older Earth/rock around it, all I got are multiple insults as usual, but not one answer to my query.  \n You said this: \n You actually don't have a clue, do you? You continue to make yourself look foolish when you post such mindless drivel.\n  And This: \n Are you sure? Do you even know what is being dated? I guess it is preferable to look foolish than to learn what you are talking about.\n  And This: \n So you are aware that you don't understand what you are talking about? Funny. If you don't understand, how can you justify rejecting the science?\n \n Notice you offer no real answer to my very valid question. Just more insults and claims that I just don't get it. My question is pandion, if you understand it so well, why didn't you correct my alleged misunderstanding even once rather than revert to your old standby of just insulting my intelligence?\n \n Could it be that my question regarding the value of dating the rock surrounding the fossil which evolutionists claim is ancient under every other circumstance is such a practical and common sense question that you never considered it, since we all know that evolutionists lack any semblance of common sense and never dare ask the difficult questions?

   "I'm just trying to get something clear. If fossils aren't dated, then why would the scientist at Cambridge date it and not the rocks around it?\nYou're not paying attention. The scientists at Cambridge didn't date the fossil itself. Most people who have an interest in the topic have at least a basic knowledge of what is being talked about. Thus, when a scientist says that the fossil was dated, anyone who knows at least the basics understands that it was not the fossil that was directly dated. This presents a problem when someone with no understanding of the subject reads that scientists dated a fossil. Later that same ignorant person reads his own cut and paste and finds that it was the rock around the fossil that was dated. That's how he arrived at his assertion that the same specimen was dated by the same machine 5 times and yielded 5 different dates. Notice the failure to support that assertion when asked several times, and then citing a cut and paste that doesn't say anything about the same specimen. Isn't that a remarkable lack of integrity? Not enough self respect to stand up and admit his error.\n \n At any rate, the fossil under discussion is KNM ER 1470, found at Koobi Fora on the east side of Lake Turkana in Kenya in 1972. The fossil itself has never been directly dated because that would be impossible. In fact, the rock in which it was embedded has never been dated. That isn't what the scientists at Cambridge dated. It is sedimentary rock, very soft and weathered at the site. The fossil was weathering out of the soil. As anyone who has even made a slight effort to learn the basics knows, sedimentary rock cannot be dated radiometrically. The reason is that the sediment is obviously composed of particles of much older rock that has weathered, been transported to the site, and then re-lithified. The rocks wouldn't yield any sort of meaningful date in relation to the fossil and when it was buried. Most fossils are buried in sedimentary rock and thus neither the rock nor the fossils are datable. The fossil itself is rock that was formed as the organic material was replaced by minerals over hundreds of thousands of years. Only creationists would believe that scientists try to date such material.\n \n So what was dated, you ask? Volcanic material from a single stratum known as the KBS Tuff. The original testing was preliminary, done on two different samples from near the site, some volcanic ash and some feldspar crystals. The method used on each was K-AR, i.e., Potassium/Argon dating. When rocks are hot argon gas is able to escape easily. When the rock cools, argon is trapped. Thus, new volcanic flows contain no argon gas. However, the rocks contain potassium, of which a known percentage is K-40. K-40 is unstable and decays to Ar-40. The K-Ar ratio, when measured establishes the radiometric date of the sample. KNM ER 1470 was found in sedimentary rock below the KBS Tuff and is thus, older than the tuff.\n \n So you see, even from the first, there was no dating of the same sample 5 times. But the problem was in the collecting of samples. Several samples from the tuff returned varying dates between 1.9 my and 2.6 my. In fact, samples from the tuff were dated at least 41 times. Studies of the area show that the disparity of dates was caused by three factors: difficulty in identifying the correct tuff horizontally across the area, contamination of the tuff by older volcanic deposits, and \"overprinting\", specific events of heat, pressure, or chemical environment that alter the composition of the exposed minerals (for example, by allowing argon gas to escape). Subsequent work has indicated that the tuff is about 1.8 mya.\n \n But the youngest date for the KBS Tuff was around 1.8 my, which means that KNM ER 1470 is around 2 mya. Creationists have to deny this since it does not fit a 6,000 year old earth.",

To put it in short, the fossil itself was never dated, and because we date the rocks around fossils everytime we want to find out how old the fossil is, we call that \"dating the fossil\" - got it. \n \n So the rock wasn't dated 5 times, but 41, and also, there were problems with the rocks that later got sorted out. It got sorted out because they used different methods to date the rocks, which were better suited to the environment.

   "I've already known that you can't date lava rocks.\nActually, lava is one of the most reliable sources of datable specimens, as long as you are careful not to date mafic inclusions. Creationists like to date mafic inclusions (unmelted rocks from earlier eruptions that have been included in an eruption). That is why the KBS Tuff was thought to be reliable. At the time, the scientists didn't expect contamination. The KBS Tuff isn't lava. It is volcanic ash that was spread much farther than the lava. My brother lived in Billings, MT when Mount St. Helens erupted. Volcanic ash covered everything. But it wasn't lava. But that layer of volcanic ash will be datable by geologists some thousands of years in the future. Except when erosion of superimposed layers exposes the volcanic layer. Then, when another volcanic eruption occurs, the ash falls on previous volcanic ash. It confuses radiometric dating. Such seems to be the case at the Koobi Fora.\n \n Really hot lava, when it was extruded, is really good for certain types of radiometric dating. When it comes to relatively cool lava, like in Hawaii, one must be careful to avoid mafic inclusions.",
