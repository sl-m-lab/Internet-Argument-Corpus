   "Howdy,\n \n I asked this question in another thread but didn't get an answer.\n \n When someone goes to heaven or hell, what is it that actually goes?\n There are stories in the Bible where someone \"looks down\" into hell or \"looks up\" into heaven and sees someone there. What are they looking at?\n \n It can't be your body, since after you die, that sits and rots here in the physical realm, despite what is said here:\n \n \nMatthew 5\n 29If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.\n 30And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell.\n \n\n \n or\n \n \nMatthew 10\n 28Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell.\n\n Would you even care if your body was destroyed after life? Well, that seems to be the inevitable case anyway.\n \n Here it even mentions a \"fire\" in hell. It must \"burn\" something. What is it burning?\n \nMatthew 18\n 9And if your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell.\n\n Is this \"fire\" simply a metaphor?\n \n This sounds more metaphorical (but shouldn't we be reading literally?)\n \nJames 3:6\n The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body. It corrupts the whole person, sets the whole course of his life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell. \n\n Obviously one's tongue is not literally a fire (but the earth was created in six days.)\n \n \n \n \n So, when a person dies and goes to hell, what is it that resides in hell?\n Is there really a literal fire and is something really burning?\n Is a soul flammable?\n \n \n \n .",

   "When someone goes to heaven or hell, what is it that actually goes?\n\n The soul.\n \nThere are stories in the Bible where someone \"looks down\" into hell or \"looks up\" into heaven and sees someone there. What are they looking at?\n\n You have to look at the time, that dispensation, to understand the meaning of it. The body died and the soul was sent to a place called hell, sheol, Gehennah, the Abyss, etc., if the person was evil, to await judgment, or was sent to the Bosom of Abraham, or paradise, or, as I believe, a place of rest for the righteous ones, who also await judgment. It would be foolish to say what this looks like or what it&#8217;s parameters might be, for no one can know, but I believe that one, while in that waiting zone, can &#8220;see&#8221; from one place to another, but not travel there. That is what was meant by that passage of scripture.\n \nIt can't be your body, since after you die, that sits and rots here in the physical realm, despite what is said here:\n Matthew 5\n or\n Matthew 10\n Would you even care if your body was destroyed after life? Well, that seems to be the inevitable case anyway\n Here it even mentions a \"fire\" in hell. It must \"burn\" something. What is it burning?\n Is this \"fire\" simply a metaphor?\n\n The burning is the sudden realization that all the things in Bible were true, that agony of consciousness at the moment you realize &#8211; &#8220;Hey! There really is a God and it&#8217;s the God of the Bible!&#8221; So, it&#8217;s not a literal fire, but that which strikes the spirit-man as truth and the realization that they made the wrong choice. When the soul reaches that point, where things natural are brushed away, leaving only that which lasts forever or will be destroyed into nothingness, it is that thought that he/she/it will be separated from God forever that causes wailing, weeping and the gnashing of teeth; to see the Kingdom God and its Glory and realize that you/he/she/it will be cast out and just be no more. To understand that further, anything, no matter what it is, when it leaves the presence of God, just disappears as if it never was.\n \nThis sounds more metaphorical (but shouldn't we be reading literally?)\n\n The Bible is a roadmap, to be taken as it is written&#8230;period. But some things are written literally and some are not. And it is the person, with the assistance of the Holy Spirit, who can comprehend the difference.\n \nObviously one's tongue is not literally a fire (but the earth was created in six days.)\n\n Taking a jab aren&#8217;t you, P? Like I said above, the Bible is self-explanatory, but it takes help and that&#8217;s what the Helper is for. Hebrews 13 : 6 &#8211; &#8220;&#8230;the Lord is my Helper.&#8221;\n \nSo, when a person dies and goes to hell, what is it that resides in hell?\n\n Nothing. Hell, in that sense of the word, is a portal through which pass those unfaithful to be destroyed. When that soul is destroyed it is destroyed completely.\n \nIs there really a literal fire and is something really burning?\n Is a soul flammable?\n\n Spiritually? Yes to both questions.",

It sounds like it's impying that I should be blind or risk eternal fire (ouch, i think).\n\n You missed the main ingredient: the Holy Spirit.\n If you are dedicated to learning, you must have a teacher. That&#8217;s the way it is with anything, the better the teacher, the more you learn, the more you learn, the more you ask, the more you ask the more you receive. That&#8217;s one thing that&#8217;s not stressed as much as it should be. One must ask for help from the Lord before his studies begin or else you won&#8217;t know what to take literally and what to take symbolically or, more specifically, as a channel to a greater understanding of His Word. One thing that most people, and some believers, don&#8217;t get is that there are secrets kept in the Bible only for those that truly want to know God and His plan. It is written in black and white that Jesus was glad that some things are hidden from the powers of darkness, and I can understand why. If they knew they would do everything in their power to pervert His Word.\n \nThat's not what it says. It says nothing about your soul burning, but it does say something about one's body burning. I don't know how you could have thought that it meant the soul without using some sort of extraneous reasoning. If it doesn't say the soul, but does say the body, why should I believe that it meant the soul?\n\n In some parts the soul does mean a body, and still does to this day. For example in some regions of the world after a plane crash, you might hear, \"&#8230;and there was not left a soul alive that could declare what happened&#8230;\"\n In this instance it is a body, but after the death of the body, the soul of a human lives until judgment, then some live forever and some are destroyed. As far as the passage of scripture you&#8217;re referring to, the \"body\" mentioned here in context with hell, is the torments here on earth by which we allow evil to ruin our lives, literally &#8211; therefore both the body and soul can be destroyed in hell, by hell and through hell.\n \nNothing in the Bible says anything about one's soul going to hell, except to say that there is one with the capability to destroy the soul in hell (as long as he destroys the body there too). Matthew 10:28\n\n I agree, in keeping with my reply above.\n \nNow, is the soul destroyed or does it burn forever? I can choose whichever based on the wording of the bible.\n\n I believe that it is destroyed.\n You can see in Matthew 25:46 it says, \"And these will go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into life eternal.\" &#8230;and say, \"There is the proof that souls burn forever&#8230;\", but without God&#8217;s guidance, you have misread. It says punishment. One time for all times &#8211; not punishing forever. It&#8217;s a one-time deal, done and over with. And it&#8217;s not the pain of a literal fire, but that burning of realization that you will be separated from God&#8230;period, which, like I said, is to be \"no more\", or, if you prefer, just disappear. Obadiah 16 says, &#8230;and they shall be as though they had never been.\n God is not going to torment his own creation for billions of millennia, as some fire-n-brimstone preachers would want us to believe. Besides, they only want you to turn from your \"wicked\" ways and seem not to care about turning you to Truth.\n \nAgain, this is conjecture. The bible does not say any of this. It sounds made up. If I came across the bible with no prior knowledge, I would only have what it says to go by. \n\n It does sound made-up, I guess, but it&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s the same knowledge I can call \"made-up\" about the String Theory if I have not zealously studied it. Neither you nor I can say we have knowledge, or even insight, into anything unless we apply ourselves diligently. And that&#8217;s what the Bible is for and what God wants us to do: Dig and find the Truth, not believing in some pagan religion reminiscent to that of Plato and his \"perpetual recycling of human souls\".\n \nThe soul has teeth? and a throat to wail with and tear ducts to weep with?\n\n Of course not, not those of human beings, but spiritually. The soul is not some globule of goo that oozes out into space after we die. It is the shape of us, our earthly bodies, but not human.\n \nIs that hell? No fire? Just nothing? Why would the Bible talk about fire?\n\n No literal fire. For example, the consuming fire of God is not a literal fire, nor is it literal when you are \"on fire\" for some sexy-looking babe on the beach&#8230;\n \nI guess I have to trust the voice in my head that the earth was not created in six days and that little in the Bible is to be taken literally or seriously.\n\n Voice in your head &#8211; like Jeffrey Dahmer?

No matter how far we go on our own, the human element needs company from other humans sometimes.\n And it&#8217;s you&#8217;re opinion that the Bible is far from self-explanatory. How long did it take you figure out how to drive, how to read and write, how to solve even the most basic problems? At a glance, I agree, the Bible would seem that way, though.\n \nSo where is the fire? Isn't the whole person \"itself set on fire by hell\"?

   "The main point I was trying to make in the first place was that some parts of the Bible are quite obviously meant to be read as a metaphor, but some parts of the Bible are a little less obvious and who is to decide which passage is a metaphor and which passage is meant to be taken literally?\n \n I thought a good place to start with this was \"the fires of hell\" because it can be taken either way it seems. I was really hoping for a response from some of the crowd that likes to post in the Cvs.E section of this forum, claiming Genesis to be a literal description of events. \n \n I have no problem with people reading things as metaphors or allegories and then applying the message to their lives. It just seems silly to me to read things that cannot possibly be literal as such, ie. the \"tongue of fire\".\n \n I honestly cannot say that I have a real interest in studying the Bible or anything religious except to further my general knowledge. I don't intend to believe anything mystical or supernatural, whatever that means. \n \n \nYou missed the main ingredient: the Holy Spirit.\n If you are dedicated to learning, you must have a teacher. That's the way it is with anything, the better the teacher, the more you learn, the more you learn, the more you ask, the more you ask the more you receive.

It is written in black and white that Jesus was glad that some things are hidden from the powers of darkness, and I can understand why. If they knew they would do everything in their power to pervert His Word.\n\n See, this paragraph tells me that (assuming I can't communicate directly with the Holy Spirit as my teacher) that I must read some parts literally and some parts figuratively. This makes sense to me as an average person, but a fundamentalist would not agree.\n \n \nIn some parts the soul does mean a body, and still does to this day. For example in some regions of the world after a plane crash, you might hear, \"...and there was not left a soul alive that could declare what happened...\"\n In this instance it is a body, but after the death of the body, the soul of a human lives until judgment, then some live forever and some are destroyed. As far as the passage of scripture you're referring to, the \"body\" mentioned here in context with hell, is the torments here on earth by which we allow evil to ruin our lives, literally - therefore both the body and soul can be destroyed in hell, by hell and through hell.\n\n Well, when I read \"not a soul...\" I take that to mean \"not a person.\" A \"person\" (to me at least) is more than the sum of its parts, as in: even if it didn't have a supernatural soul, it would be more than a mere body. But still, if there is no supernatural soul then everything associated with the person is contained within the physical realm and the physical body. \n \n \nI believe that it is destroyed.\n You can see in Matthew 25:46 it says, \"And these will go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into life eternal.\" ...and say, \"There is the proof that souls burn forever...\", but without God's guidance, you have misread. It says punishment. One time for all times - not punishing forever. It's a one-time deal, done and over with.

Besides, they only want you to turn from your \"wicked\" ways and seem not to care about turning you to Truth.\n\n Yes, and your belief is too logical for me to argue with. I need someone that believes that something burns forever in a fire per a literal reading of the Bible. O well.\n \n \nIt does sound made-up, I guess, but it's not. It's the same knowledge I can call \"made-up\" about the String Theory if I have not zealously studied it. Neither you nor I can say we have knowledge, or even insight, into anything unless we apply ourselves diligently. And that's what the Bible is for and what God wants us to do: Dig and find the Truth, not believing in some pagan religion reminiscent to that of Plato and his \"perpetual recycling of human souls\".\n\n What would be ironic is if you dug to find the truth and the truth was that the Bible was false. \n \n \nOf course not, not those of human beings, but spiritually. The soul is not some globule of goo that oozes out into space after we die. It is the shape of us, our earthly bodies, but not human.\n\n I don't understand why it must be the \"shape\" of the human body. If it is not physical then how can it even have a shape?\n \n \nNo literal fire. For example, the consuming fire of God is not a literal fire, nor is it literal when you are \"on fire\" for some sexy-looking babe on the beach...\n\n Gotcha. I wish a literalist would chime in on this one. O well.\n \n\n Voice in your head - like Jeffrey Dahmer?

If you think God is a myth, then the Bible will always be a book of lies and fables.\n\n Nah, I just mean the one where I talk to myself. You know, my \"inner dialogue.\" The one that keeps asking \"When are you going to get off your butt and assassinate Jerry Falwell?\" At least that's what the Holy Spirit told me. \"Blow him away in the name of the Lord!\"\n (reference to: http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0410/24/le.01.html\n \n FALWELL: Well, I'm for that too. But you've got to kill the terrorists before the killing stops. And I'm for the president to chase them all over the world. If it takes 10 years, blow them all away in the name of the Lord.) emoticon_xagree\n \n \nThere are many people, such as myself, that are still learning and we need those of like-mind for encouragement and strength - and as humanity goes - for assurance that we are making a difference.

We can simply connect it to the fact that we are a biological organism, an inextricable part of the natural world around us. As such, IMHO, we can link with it on a level past the superficial that we so often operate on if we have the desire too. \n \n I kind of liken the experience you've described to coming home after a long absence, you can still connect with those surroundings. I think in the same way mankind can still connect with nature, it's still a deep seated part of us.\n \n Waxy\n \n P.S. I hope to get that \"fuzzy\" feeling next week when I take a few days off and go and do a little hunting back home.",

   "The main point I was trying to make in the first place was that some parts of the Bible are quite obviously meant to be read as a metaphor, but some parts of the Bible are a little less obvious and who is to decide which passage is a metaphor and which passage is meant to be taken literally?\n \n\n Perhaps the Old Testament should be read as an allegory : it has many of the appearances of a narrative but is meant to be understood symbolically.\n Most Christians, I think, would claim that the New Testament is at least in parts an objective record of historical events.",

   "Hi pnac=ww3:\n \n In your examples, the fire is not the metaphor, I believe that it is the cutting off the body part that is metaphorical and hence, not meant to be taken literally. Matthew 5:29-30 is under the heading \"Adultery\". Therefore, you interpret what is being said with reference to the sin of adultery. The part about the eye, is saying for you to control your eye and not look at a woman lustfully. I'm sure you can figure out a similar meaning for the hand part. :p \n \n Once again, you have to look at what context Matthew 10 is written in. Jesus is preparing the Twelve to go out and preach amongst the \"lost sheep of Israel\" (i.e. the \"lost\" children of Israel). Up in verse 17 onwards, Jesus warns them about being on guard for those men who will hand \"you over to the local councils and flog you in their synagogues\". Verse 28, is refering to the Twelve (and to Christians now a days) not to be scared of the men that can kill you because you are a follower of Jesus, but be afraid of the ones that can convert you from your faith in Jesus Christ. We'll talk about the body part later.\n \n Matthew 18 is much like Matthew 5 in interpretation. You are not going to cut out your eye just because you keep looking at a certain girl, are you? To stop, you would set boundaries for your eyes (see the book title \"Every Mans Battle\" for more information on how to do that), or make a covenant with God about your eyes. It is also a warning, if you keep doing that particular sin, than you will never reach the Kingdom of God and ultimately be in hell. Basically, \"stop doing the sin at all costs because it will keep you out of Heaven\" is how I would read it and it seems reasonable enough. However, if you can't stop doing it even after all avenues of rehabiltation have been done, well, that's your choice... I would like to point out that rehabilitation of one form or another usually works. Also, nothing is impossible for God, prayer is a very powerful tool.\n \n \nHere it even mentions a \"fire\" in hell. It must \"burn\" something. What is it burning?\n\n \n When we die, we recieve new bodies - my knowledge is limited in this area. When our local Church's CO died of cancer, his wife said something to the effect of him having a new perfect body and being in a painless, deathless place, i.e. the Kingdom of God. I really don't know how this all works though.\n \n \n \n(but shouldn't we be reading literally?)\n\n \n In some parts of the Bible that obviously contain poetic or figurative language, no, it should not be taken literally. I think that the use of cutting off parts is a metaphor for what Jesus was saying. If this was to be taken literally, we would have pieces of bones and eyes everywhere on the street. Some Christian people who suffer from sexual immorality, e.g. looking at porn, don't cut out their eyes. They know that they must stop it, so typically look for help (e.g. in the book mentioned above) and pray to God. I think that many of the verses you cited are a metaphor for a warning. For example, Psalms is a poetic book, using lots of metaphors and similies and other poetic language features. Likewise, Job is filled with them. You have to interpret what is being said in the context of what it is written. For example, the first few chapters of Genesis contains no metaphors or similies, nor any other form of poetic language, hence, it is to be taken literally. For example, the Parable of the Weeds (Matthew 13:24) is a series of similies to illustrate the Kingdom of Heaven in terms that humans can understand. \n \n \nIs there really a literal fire and is something really burning?\n\n \n According to the Bible, people who are bad and go to hell are thrown into a lake of fire (Revelation 21:14). Fire does usually burn - I'm sure you have seen it's effects on people who have been burned for a few seconds, imagine being burned for eternity and not dying because according to the Bible we are made in the image of God and thus have eternal souls (i.e. can't die)....",

We don't get chance at eternity until AFTER what was revealed in Revelation - then you get to live or be destroyed - and that judgement will come from Christ.\n\n \n But since we are made in the image of God, do we not have His immortal soul? When Adam sinned against God, God brought death into His creation and lessened His sustaining power over His creation. Our boides may die, but our souls live on. When we die on \n \n In Jude verse 7, we read:\n In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire [NIV]. \n \n Revelation 21:7-10 tells us about the devil, false prophet and the beast being thrown into a lake of burning sulphur where they will be tormented day and night for ever and ever.\n \n We also read further in Revelation 21:8 about those who will be thrown into the firely lake of burning sulphur - the second death. \n \n None other than Jesus Christ warned of hell, in fact, He spoke the warnings of hell more than He spoke about Heaven. He also made it clear that the torment of the wicked was as eternal (Greek aionios) as the life of the blessed (Matthew 25:46). God does not delight in the death of the wicked.\n \"Say unto them, as I live, said teh Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn, turn from your evil ways; for why will you die, O house of Israel?\" (Ezekiel 33:11).\n \n True, our God is a loving and merciful God. He is also just and will grant us our wish, i.e. if we cling to our sins, in which case God will grant our wish and seperate us from Himself for eternity. This is why Jesus, on the Day of Judgement, says to evildoers, \"Depart from me...\" (Matthew 7:23, Luke 13:27). If we seperate from our sins by trusting in Christ, God will grant us our wish and allow us to enter His Kingdom where there will be no more death, pain, suffering, etc.",

   "It must be understood, first of all, that we cannot take all Scripture to be literal. For instance, Psalm 22:14 reads as follows - I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint. My heart has turned to wax; it has melted away within me. Now, I think we all know that David's heart was not actually wax, nor was he being poured out of something in liquid form. This is a song or poem whichever we prefer. There is a lot of symbolism that takes place here.\n \n I do understand, however, that the Scriptures that you referred to are not poems and are not songs. What we have to realize though are two things. First of all, the writers of the time used a style of writing that was unique to their culture and people. They way they write a story or letter is not done in the same way that we would today. Plagarism was not illegal in their time, and it does take place in the Bible many times. Using exaggerations were probably a common thing as well. \n \n The second thing we need to understand is that we are finite creatures trying to explain some aspects of the infinite. It is like a mouse trying to understand what it is like to be human. It can't happen because a mouse does not have the capacity or the perspective to do so. In the same way, we are not capable of describing what it is like to be God or be with God. When we read about someone looking into heaven or hell we have to understand that when that person wrote about that experience, they had to use finite words to describe something on a grander scale. The message of the Bible is infinite, however, the number of words that were used is finite.\n \n To describe what heaven or hell looks like is impossible. So, in order to describe this location...the writers used descriptions that we could understand. We know what it is like to be hot and to burn. It is not pleasant so we know that hell is not pleasant. Lucky for us, the writers used terms that we understand so we can at the very least gain a small understanding of what heaven and hell are like.\n \n In God's love",

   "I guess I can only answer your question with another question. If we all understood everything and had unconditional salvation...would there be any need for faith? We are told to \"Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding.\" (Proverbs 3:5) In order for us to understand God fully means that we would be equal to God. Although we are made in God's image, we are not equal to God. Even Jesus \"being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped.\" (Philippians 2:6) \n \n In regards to unconditional salvation...\n \n If we were saved unconditionally, then we have to address the question of free-will. We have the freedom to choose for ourselves what we do, how we act, and most importantly, what we believe. If we were given unconditional salvation, then two things happen. Free-will becomes a thing of the past and Jesus dying on the cross in meaningless.\n \n We are called to have faith...not to understand. If God revealed everything to us then there would be no need for faith. I know it is just a television show but if you have ever watched Joan of Arcadia, this fact is illustrated every week. If you have not watched it, I encourage you to do so. God always calls Joan to do things but every time she asks questions, she gets no response. However, she continues to do what is asked of her. Why? because she has faith. She does not think she does...but she does or she would not listen.\n \n I am sure that I have made more questions come up now rather than simply answering the ones that you posed originally. I have a tendency to do that though.\n \n In God's love",
