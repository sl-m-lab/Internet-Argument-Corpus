   "I'm taking liberties here and discounting Deism as a \"god\" thing:\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/22/books/review/Will.t.html\n \n October 22, 2006\n God of Our Fathers \n By GEORGE F. WILL\n Not since the medieval church baptized, as it were, Aristotle as some sort of early - very early - church father has there been an intellectual hijacking as audacious as the attempt to present America's principal founders as devout Christians. Such an attempt is now in high gear among people who argue that the founders were kindred spirits with today's evangelicals, and that they founded a \"Christian nation.\"\n \n This irritates Brooke Allen, an author and critic who has distilled her annoyance into \"Moral Minority: Our Skeptical Founding Fathers.\" It is a wonderfully high-spirited and informative polemic that, as polemics often do, occasionally goes too far. Her thesis is that the six most important founders - Franklin, Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison and Hamilton - subscribed, in different ways, to the watery and undemanding Enlightenment faith called deism. That doctrine appealed to rationalists by being explanatory but not inciting: it made the universe intelligible without arousing dangerous zeal.\n \n Eighteenth-century deists believed there was a God but, tellingly, they frequently preferred synonyms for him - \"Almighty Being\" or \"Divine Author\" (Washington) or \"a Superior Agent\" (Jefferson). Having set the universe in motion like a clockmaker, Providence might reward and punish, perhaps in the hereafter, but does not intervene promiscuously in human affairs. (Washington did see \"the hand of Providence\" in the result of the Revolutionary War.) Deists rejected the Incarnation, hence the divinity of Jesus. \"Christian deist\" is an oxymoron.\n \n Allen's challenge is to square the six founders' often pious public words and behavior with her conviction that their real beliefs placed all six far from Christianity. Her conviction is well documented, exuberantly argued and quite persuasive.\n \n When Franklin was given some books written to refute deism, the deists' arguments \"appeared to me much stronger than the refutations; in short, I soon became a thorough deist.\" Revelation \"had indeed no weight with me.\" He believed in a creator and the immortality of the soul, but considered these \"the essentials of every religion.\"\n \n What Allen calls Washington's \"famous gift of silence\" was particularly employed regarding religion. But his behavior spoke. He would not kneel to pray, and when his pastor rebuked him for setting a bad example by leaving services before communion, Washington mended his ways in his austere manner: he stayed away from church on communion Sundays. He acknowledged Christianity's \"benign influence\" on society, but no ministers were present and no prayers were uttered as he died a Stoic's death.\n \n Adams declared that \"phylosophy looks with an impartial Eye on all terrestrial religions,\" and told a correspondent that if they had been on Mount Sinai with Moses and had been told the doctrine of the Trinity, \"We might not have had courage to deny it, but We could not have believed it.\" It is true that the longer he lived, the shorter grew his creed, and in the end his creed was Unitarianism.\n \n Jefferson, writing as a laconic utilitarian, urged his nephew to inquire into the truthfulness of Christianity without fear of consequences: \"If it ends in a belief that there is no god, you will find incitements to virtue in the comforts and pleasantness you feel in its exercise, and the love of others which it will procure you.\" \n \n Madison, always common-sensical, briskly explained - essentially, explained away - religion as an innate appetite: \"The mind prefers at once the idea of a self-existing cause to that of an infinite series of cause & effect.\" When Congress hired a chaplain, he said \"it was not with my approbation.\"\n \n In 1781, the Articles of Confederation acknowledged \"the Great Governor of the World,\" but six years later the Constitution made no mention of God. When Hamilton was asked why, he jauntily said, \"We forgot.\" Ten years after the Constitutional Convention, the Senate unanimously ratified a treaty with Islamic Tripoli that declared the United States government \"is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion.\"\n \n (More)",

   "Allen neglects one argument for her thesis that the United States is a \"secular project\": the Constitution mandates the establishment of a political truth by guaranteeing each state the same form of government (\"republican\"). It does so because the founders thought the most important political truths are knowable. But because they thought religious truths are unknowable, they proscribed the establishment of religion.\n \n Allen succumbs to what her six heroes rightly feared - zeal - in her prosecution of today's religious zealots. In a grating anachronism unworthy of her serious argument, she calls the founders \"the very prototypes, in fact, of the East Coast intellectuals we are always being warned against by today's religious right.\" (Madison, an NPR listener? Maybe not.) When she says \"Richard Nixon and George W. Bush, among other recent American statesmen,\" have subscribed to the \"philosophy\" that there should be legal impediments to an atheist becoming president, she is simply daft. And when she says that Bible study sessions in the White House and Justice Department today are \"a form of potential religious harassment that should be considered as unacceptable as the sexual variety,\" she is exhibiting the sort of hostility to the free exercise of religion that has energized religious voters, to her sorrow.\n \n Two days after Jefferson wrote his letter endorsing a \"wall of separation\" between church and state, he attended, as he occasionally did, religious services in the House of Representatives. Jefferson was an observant yet unbelieving Anglican/Episcopalian throughout his public life. This was a statesmanlike accommodation of the public's strong preference, which then as now was for religion to have ample space in the public square.\n \n Christianity, particularly its post-Reformation ferments, fostered attitudes and aptitudes associated with popular government. Protestantism's emphasis on the individual's direct, unmediated relationship with God, and the primacy of individual conscience and choice, subverted conventions of hierarchical societies in which deference was expected from the many toward the few. But beyond that, America's founding owes much more to John Locke than to Jesus. \n \n The founders created a distinctly modern regime, one respectful of pre-existing rights - natural rights, not creations of the regime. And in 1786, the year before the Constitutional Convention constructed the regime, Jefferson, in the preamble to the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, proclaimed that \"our civil rights have no dependence on our religious opinions, any more than our opinions in physics or geometry.\"\n \n Since the founding, America's religious enthusiasms have waxed and waned, confounding Jefferson's prediction, made in 1822, four years before his death, that \"there is not a young man now living in the United States who will not die an Unitarian.\" In 1908, William Jennings Bryan, the Democrats' presidential nominee, said his Republican opponent, William Howard Taft, was unfit because, being a Unitarian, he did not believe in the Virgin Birth. The electorate yawned and chose Taft.\n \n A century on, when the most reliable predictor of a voter's behavior is whether he or she regularly attends church services, it is highly unlikely that Republicans would nominate a Unitarian. In 1967, when Gov. George Romney of Michigan evinced interest in the Republican presidential nomination, his Mormonism was of little interest and hence was no impediment. Four decades later, the same may not be true if his son Mitt, also a Mormon, seeks the Republican nomination in 2008.\n \n In 1953, the year before \"under God\" was added to the Pledge of Allegiance, President Dwight D. Eisenhower declared July 4 a day of \"penance and prayer.\" That day he fished in the morning, golfed in the afternoon and played bridge in the evening. Allen and others who fret about a possibly theocratic future can take comfort from the fact that America's public piety is more frequently avowed than constraining.\n \n George F. Will is a syndicated columnist.",

When Hamilton was asked why, he jauntily said, \"We forgot.\"\n\n \n Actually it was concluded \"In the .... Year of our Lord.\" And the Consitution was formulated to secure those rights among men that the fathers already understood to have originated from their Creator (DOI). \n \n \n\n Ten years after the Constitutional Convention, the Senate unanimously ratified a treaty with Islamic Tripoli that declared the United States government \"is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion.\"\n (More)\n\n \n Article 11 merely says that the government of America is not founded on the Christian religion (as in a theocracy). This does not mean that the majority of Americans were not of the Christian faith, and it certainly doesn't address the numerous Judeo-Christian principles upon which our country founded. In those respects, it falls short in describing America.\n \n THE STATE AND THE CHURCH:\n JEFFERSON AND MADISON\n \n It is no exaggeration to say that on Sundays in Washington during the administrations of Thomas Jefferson (1801-1809) and of James Madison (1809-1817) the state became the church. Within a year of his inauguration, Jefferson began attending church services in the House of Representatives. Madison followed Jefferson's example, although unlike Jefferson, who rode on horseback to church in the Capitol, Madison came in a coach and four. Worship services in the House--a practice that continued until after the Civil War--were acceptable to Jefferson because they were nondiscriminatory and voluntary. Preachers of every Protestant denomination appeared. (Catholic priests began officiating in 1826.) As early as January 1806 a female evangelist, Dorothy Ripley, delivered a camp meeting-style exhortation in the House to Jefferson, Vice President Aaron Burr, and a \"crowded audience.\" Throughout his administration Jefferson permitted church services in executive branch buildings. The Gospel was also preached in the Supreme Court chambers. \n \n Reserved Seats at Capitol Services\n \n Here is a description, by an early Washington \"insider,\" Margaret Bayard Smith (1778-1844), a writer and social critic and wife of Samuel Harrison Smith, publisher of the National Intelligencer, of Jefferson's attendance at church services in the House of Representatives: \"Jefferson during his whole administration was a most regular attendant. The seat he chose the first day sabbath, and the adjoining one, which his private secretary occupied, were ever afterwards by the courtesy of the congregation, left for him.\"\n \n The Old House of Representatives\n \n Church services were held in what is now called Statuary Hall from 1807 to 1857. The first services in the Capitol, held when the government moved to Washington in the fall of 1800, were conducted in the \"hall\" of the House in the north wing of the building. In 1801 the House moved to temporary quarters in the south wing, called the \"Oven,\" which it vacated in 1804, returning to the north wing for three years. Services were conducted in the House until after the Civil War. The Speaker's podium was used as the preacher's pulpit. \n \n A Millennialist Sermon Preached in Congress\n \n This sermon on the millennium was preached by the Baltimore Swedenborgian minister, John Hargrove (1750-1839) in the House of Representatives. One of the earliest millennialist sermons preached before Congress was offered on July 4, 1801, by the Reverend David Austin (1759-1831), who at the time considered himself \"struck in prophesy under the style of the Joshua of the American Temple.\" Having proclaimed to his Congressional audience the imminence of the Second Coming of Christ, Austin took up a collection on the floor of the House to support services at \"Lady Washington's Chapel\" in a nearby hotel where he was teaching that \"the seed of the Millennial estate is found in the backbone of the American Revolution.\"\n \n First Catholic Sermon in the House\n \n On January 8, 1826, Bishop John England (1786-1842) of Charleston, South Carolina, became the first Catholic clergyman to preach in the House of Representatives. The overflow audience included President John Quincy Adams, whose July 4, 1821, speech England rebutted in his sermon. \n \n Woman Preacher in the House (and call for revival!)\n \n In 1827, Harriet Livermore (1788-1868), the daughter and granddaughter of Congressmen, became the second woman to preach in the House of Representatives. The first woman to preach before the House (and probably the first woman to speak officially in Congress under any circumstances) was the English evangelist, Dorothy Ripley (1767-1832), who conducted a service on January 12, 1806. Jefferson and Vice President Aaron Burr were among those in a \"crowded audience.\" Sizing up the congregation, Ripley concluded that \"very few\" had been born again and broke into an urgent, camp meeting style exhortation, insisting that \"Christ's Body was the Bread of Life and His Blood the drink of the righteous.\"\n \n Communion Service in the Treasury Building\n \n Manasseh Cutler here describes a four-hour communion service in the Treasury Building, conducted by a Presbyterian minister, the Reverend James Laurie: \"Attended worship at the Treasury. Mr. Laurie alone. Sacrament. Full assembly. Three tables; service very solemn; nearly four hours.\" \n \n Adams's Description of a Church Service in the Supreme Court\n \n John Quincy Adams here describes the Reverend James Laurie, pastor of a Presbyterian Church that had settled into the Treasury Building, preaching to an overflow audience in the Supreme Court Chamber, which in 1806 was located on the ground floor of the Capitol. \n \n The Old Supreme Court Chamber\n \n Description of church services in the Supreme Court chamber by Manasseh Cutler (1804) and John Quincy Adams (1806) indicate that services were held in the Court soon after the government moved to Washington in 1800.\n \n  Church Services in Congress after the Civil War\n \n Charles Boynton (1806-1883) was in 1867 chaplain of the House of Representatives and organizing pastor of the First Congregational Church in Washington, which was trying at that time to build its own sanctuary. In the meantime the church, as Boynton informed potential donors, was holding services \"at the Hall of Representatives\" where \"the audience is the largest in town. . . .nearly 2000 assembled every Sabbath\" for services, making the congregation in the House the \"largest Protestant Sabbath audience then in the United States.\" The First Congregational Church met in the House from 1865 to 1868. \n \n House of Representatives, After the Civil War\n \n The House moved to its current location on the south side of the Capitol in 1857. It contained the \"largest Protestant Sabbath audience\" in the United States when the First Congregational Church of Washington held services there from 1865 to 1868. \n \n Compliments: U.S. Library of Congress\n \n http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/religion/rel06-2.html\n \n See if you and the NY Times can make all that disappear.",

Read the writings of the day (and not just Jefferson. Jefferson doesn't represent all of the founding fathers' views. And who said anything about them not being skeptical of relgion's effect of govt? That's not the same as saying they were not religious. Many devout religious people believe in separation of church and state--I'm one of them.\n \n \nJefferson, most definitely, did not concur with the \"irrational\", i.e., supernatural and godly, aspects of Christianity. His revision of the Gospels very conspicuously leaves out miracles, angels, virgin births, etc. Most interestingly is he leaves out any mention of a resurrection. Like the rest of the Deists (if he believed in a god at all) it was the \"God of Nature\" \n\n \n Deism does not equate with atheism. If you are truly of an atheist mindset then you should no more be tolerating deism than theism--they both allow for the existence of God. There is more in common in terms of faith-versus-reason between a deist and a Christian than deist and an atheist. You are correct that Jefferson wrote a version of the Bible that left out miracles. However, again Jefferson does not represent the religious views of all the founding fathers (as both Epaphras and I have pointed out now). \n \n But the real difference between the non-religious founding fathers and many modern atheist/\"rationalists\" is that the founding fathers respected religion. They weren't intolerant of it. They showed enormous respect and acceptance toward the religious peers and seemed to understand that religion was a very acceptable and normal part of life that didn't require confrontation and prejudice. They freely and acceptingly worked with other religious statesmen and considered them intellectual equals. They were willing to live with religion rather than oppose it and accept it even when they themselves preferred rational thinking. So even in cases where the founding fathers prefered a non-religious rationalism, there was a real difference.",

   "The Founders were very much afraid of religion's effect on government as well. The fanatical mindset of the Puritans of Massachusetts Bay was of a great concern. I think it is reasonable to say they were concerned about the influence of church and state in both directions. Jefferson may have admired Christ, but he was not a \"follower\" - he did not believe in his divinity.\n\n \n Quite correct. I was not clear in my communication. Jefferson was a UNITARIAN perhaps the original. He did follow christs ethical teachings and did not hold to his deity, at least not completely. I find that he did not accept the doctrine of the trinity but that he thought highly of the belief of Jesus as deity and that it could lead one to great acts of lovingkindness.\n \n \nDo not be frightened from this inquiry by any fear of its consequences. If it ends in a belief that there is no god, you will find incitements to virtue in the comfort and pleasantness you feel in its exercise, and the love of others which it will procure you. If you find reason to believe there is a God, a consciousness that you are acting under his eye, and that he approves you, will be a vast additional incitement; if that there be a future state, the hope of a happy existence in that increases the appetite to deserve it; if that Jesus was also a god, you will be comforted by a belief of his aid and love. \n\n \n His basic claim was simply that it mattered in degree as to what you believed concerning comfort and incitement to virtue. I think his summary here is actually a pretty reasonable summary of where things lead.\n \n EF",

Absence of belief alone is too broad--that would include people who have never heard of God and agnostics. The thing about atheism is that it's often strongly held, and defended rigorously. Perhaps that's why people sometimes perceive it as a belief in and of itself. But I agree with you that it's not a religion, or even like a religion.

That is the context by which their theism played into the founding of our country. There is no doubt that they viewed liberty as very compatible (if not part and parcel) to theistic thinking.

   "What George Will (oooh, what a radical liberal!) has to say on the subject:\nNot since the medieval church baptized, as it were, Aristotle as some sort of early - very early - church father has there been an intellectual hijacking as audacious as the attempt to present America's principal founders as devout Christians. Such an attempt is now in high gear among people who argue that the founders were kindred spirits with today's evangelicals, and that they founded a \"Christian nation.\"\n \n This irritates Brooke Allen, an author and critic who has distilled her annoyance into \"Moral Minority: Our Skeptical Founding Fathers.\" It is a wonderfully high-spirited and informative polemic that, as polemics often do, occasionally goes too far. Her thesis is that the six most important founders - Franklin, Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison and Hamilton - subscribed, in different ways, to the watery and undemanding Enlightenment faith called deism. That doctrine appealed to rationalists by being explanatory but not inciting: it made the universe intelligible without arousing dangerous zeal.\n \n Eighteenth-century deists believed there was a God but, tellingly, they frequently preferred synonyms for him - \"Almighty Being\" or \"Divine Author\" (Washington) or \"a Superior Agent\" (Jefferson). Having set the universe in motion like a clockmaker, Providence might reward and punish, perhaps in the hereafter, but does not intervene promiscuously in human affairs. (Washington did see \"the hand of Providence\" in the result of the Revolutionary War.) Deists rejected the Incarnation, hence the divinity of Jesus. \"Christian deist\" is an oxymoron.\n \n Allen's challenge is to square the six founders' often pious public words and behavior with her conviction that their real beliefs placed all six far from Christianity. Her conviction is well documented, exuberantly argued and quite persuasive.\n \n When Franklin was given some books written to refute deism, the deists' arguments \"appeared to me much stronger than the refutations; in short, I soon became a thorough deist.\" Revelation \"had indeed no weight with me.\" He believed in a creator and the immortality of the soul, but considered these \"the essentials of every religion.\"\n \n What Allen calls Washington's \"famous gift of silence\" was particularly employed regarding religion. But his behavior spoke. He would not kneel to pray, and when his pastor rebuked him for setting a bad example by leaving services before communion, Washington mended his ways in his austere manner: he stayed away from church on communion Sundays. He acknowledged Christianity's \"benign influence\" on society, but no ministers were present and no prayers were uttered as he died a Stoic's death.\n \n Adams declared that \"phylosophy looks with an impartial Eye on all terrestrial religions,\" and told a correspondent that if they had been on Mount Sinai with Moses and had been told the doctrine of the Trinity, \"We might not have had courage to deny it, but We could not have believed it.\" It is true that the longer he lived, the shorter grew his creed, and in the end his creed was Unitarianism.\n \n Jefferson, writing as a laconic utilitarian, urged his nephew to inquire into the truthfulness of Christianity without fear of consequences: \"If it ends in a belief that there is no god, you will find incitements to virtue in the comforts and pleasantness you feel in its exercise, and the love of others which it will procure you.\" \n \n Madison, always common-sensical, briskly explained - essentially, explained away - religion as an innate appetite: \"The mind prefers at once the idea of a self-existing cause to that of an infinite series of cause & effect.\" When Congress hired a chaplain, he said \"it was not with my approbation.\"\n \n In 1781, the Articles of Confederation acknowledged \"the Great Governor of the World,\" but six years later the Constitution made no mention of God. When Hamilton was asked why, he jauntily said, \"We forgot.\" Ten years after the Constitutional Convention, the Senate unanimously ratified a treaty with Islamic Tripoli that declared the United States government \"is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion.\"\n \n Allen neglects one argument for her thesis that the United States is a \"secular project\": the Constitution mandates the establishment of a political truth by guaranteeing each state the same form of government (\"republican\"). It does so because the founders thought the most important political truths are knowable. But because they thought religious truths are unknowable, they proscribed the establishment of religion.\n \n Allen succumbs to what her six heroes rightly feared - zeal - in her prosecution of today's religious zealots. In a grating anachronism unworthy of her serious argument, she calls the founders \"the very prototypes, in fact, of the East Coast intellectuals we are always being warned against by today's religious right.\" (Madison, an NPR listener? Maybe not.) When she says \"Richard Nixon and George W. Bush, among other recent American statesmen,\" have subscribed to the \"philosophy\" that there should be legal impediments to an atheist becoming president, she is simply daft. And when she says that Bible study sessions in the White House and Justice Department today are \"a form of potential religious harassment that should be considered as unacceptable as the sexual variety,\" she is exhibiting the sort of hostility to the free exercise of religion that has energized religious voters, to her sorrow.\n \n Two days after Jefferson wrote his letter endorsing a \"wall of separation\" between church and state, he attended, as he occasionally did, religious services in the House of Representatives. Jefferson was an observant yet unbelieving Anglican/Episcopalian throughout his public life. This was a statesmanlike accommodation of the public's strong preference, which then as now was for religion to have ample space in the public square.\n \n Christianity, particularly its post-Reformation ferments, fostered attitudes and aptitudes associated with popular government. Protestantism's emphasis on the individual's direct, unmediated relationship with God, and the primacy of individual conscience and choice, subverted conventions of hierarchical societies in which deference was expected from the many toward the few. But beyond that, America's founding owes much more to John Locke than to Jesus. \n \n The founders created a distinctly modern regime, one respectful of pre-existing rights - natural rights, not creations of the regime. And in 1786, the year before the Constitutional Convention constructed the regime, Jefferson, in the preamble to the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, proclaimed that \"our civil rights have no dependence on our religious opinions, any more than our opinions in physics or geometry.\"\n \n Since the founding, America's religious enthusiasms have waxed and waned, confounding Jefferson's prediction, made in 1822, four years before his death, that \"there is not a young man now living in the United States who will not die an Unitarian.\" In 1908, William Jennings Bryan, the Democrats' presidential nominee, said his Republican opponent, William Howard Taft, was unfit because, being a Unitarian, he did not believe in the Virgin Birth. The electorate yawned and chose Taft.\n \n A century on, when the most reliable predictor of a voter's behavior is whether he or she regularly attends church services, it is highly unlikely that Republicans would nominate a Unitarian. In 1967, when Gov. George Romney of Michigan evinced interest in the Republican presidential nomination, his Mormonism was of little interest and hence was no impediment. Four decades later, the same may not be true if his son Mitt, also a Mormon, seeks the Republican nomination in 2008.\n \n In 1953, the year before \"under God\" was added to the Pledge of Allegiance, President Dwight D. Eisenhower declared July 4 a day of \"penance and prayer.\" That day he fished in the morning, golfed in the afternoon and played bridge in the evening. Allen and others who fret about a possibly theocratic future can take comfort from the fact that America's public piety is more frequently avowed than constraining.\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/22/books/review/Will.t.html?pagewanted=2&_r=1&adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1162043536-L8J5Vcbvf8/LH/PkIXxX2Q",

   "America, founded in secularism as a beacon of eighteenth century enlightenment, is becoming the victim of religious politics, a circumstance that would have horrified the Founding Fathers. The political ascendancy today values embryonic cells over adult people. It obsesses about gay marriage, ahead of genuinely important issues that actually make a difference to the world. It gains crucial electoral support from a religious constituency whose grip on reality is so tenuous that they expect to be 'raptured' up to heaven, leaving their clothes as empty as their minds. More extreme specimens actually long for a world war, which they identify as the 'Armageddon' that is to presage the Second Coming. Sam Harris, in his new short book, Letter to a Christian Nation, hits the bull's-eye as usual:\n \n It is, therefore, not an exaggeration to say that if the city of New York were suddenly replaced by a ball of fire, some significant percentage of the American population would see a silver-lining in the subsequent mushroom cloud, as it would suggest to them that the best thing that is ever going to happen was about to happen: the return of Christ . . .Imagine the consequences if any significant component of the U.S. government actually believed that the world was about to end and that its ending would be glorious. The fact that nearly half of the American population apparently believes this, purely on the basis of religious dogma, should be considered a moral and &#172;intellectual emergency.\n \n Does Bush check the Rapture Index daily, as Reagan did his stars? We don't know, but would anyone be surprised?\n \n My scientific colleagues have additional reasons to declare emergency. Ignorant and absolutist attacks on stem cell research are just the tip of an iceberg. What we have here is nothing less than a global assault on rationality, and the Enlightenment values that inspired the founding of this first and greatest of secular republics. Science education - and hence the whole future of science in this country - is under threat. Temporarily beaten back in a Pennsylvania court, the 'breathtaking inanity' (Judge John Jones's immortal phrase) of 'intelligent design' continually flares up in local bush-fires. Dowsing them is a time-consuming but important responsibility, and scientists are finally being jolted out of their complacency. For years they quietly got on with their science, lamentably underestimating the creationists who, being neither competent nor interested in science, attended to the serious political business of subverting local school boards. Scientists, and intellectuals generally, are now waking up to the threat from the American Taliban.\n Much more--and highly recommended--at: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-dawkins/why-there-almost-certainl_b_32164.html",

   "I think a major point gets missed when discussing the religious convictions of the founders of the Constitution. Most of the Founders were indeed believers. If Jefferson, Madison, Washington, etc. were not exactly devout Christians, so what? The point is that most of the crafters and proponents of the Constitution were Protestants and believed in God and Christ and thought religion was a very good idea.\n \n That makes it all the more profound that they wanted a religious nation and a religious people, but yet a secular government. This is a great achievement and a unique break from the past. These very smart folks recognized that a secular government is the best guarantee of religious freedom for everyone. They has witnessed what had gone on in Europe and wanted a change from that. \n \n There is a great deal of evidence that the writings of John Locke, the Enlightenment philosopher had a great deal of influence in this. Locke envisioned a new kind of secular government that would have no influence on religion at all, except the free exercise thereof. \n \n Thus, you take a bunch of religious guys and they write a Constitution that has no mention of God, faith, or Christ at all. This cannot be considered anything other than a purposeful omission. There is no mention of religion at all until the first ten Amendments were tacked on (and only in the first), except, to add insult to injury, in Article VI in which there is a prohibition of a religious test for government members.\n \n This caused a huge upset in all the 13 states who had to ratify this document (9/13 were needed.) In 11 of the 13, there already existed religious test laws, in which one had to be a Protestant to hold office. There was a huge debate about this, and the votes to ratify were very close.\n \n In every state convention, there was a great outcry against the omission of a religious purpose in our Constitution. They wanted references of God and Christ to be included and the inclusion of the religious test. There was a huge fear that a papist, Jew, Mohammedan or infidel would be elected. Horrors! At each turn, the proponents of the Constitution said \"No.\" This was a remarkable achievement and unique in history. \n \n Thus, you had religious people consciously omitting any reference to God or religion in the document despite an enormous opposition.

   "I believe Thelmoose did an excellent job on whether or not the fathers of our nation were \"godless\". He clearly refutes that notion. He also clearly shows their distinct concern of what can happen when governments are ruled by religion.\n \n As for christian principles, the right of choice (to choose one's own religion) is an actual right protected and esteemed in christian values. Not necessarily all christians but for certain this one. Christ died so that I would have the right to choose him or not. I find it interesting to note in the bible that Christ never beat anyone into repentence, rather than spontaneously offered it. That is not to say he did not tell them the truth about themselves. Witness the story of the woman at the well. Jesus was very honest with her as he was with the woman caught in adultery that the pharisees wanted to stone. He was clear that what the did was called \"sin\" (just let me use the term without going down the rabbit trail of what is and is not sin). He also gave them the choice. NO where does he say follow me or die a horrible death. He says to them that they are forgiven and to go and sin no more (knowing full well that they may sin again). The forgiveness is not conditional. \n \n All this to say, as a christian, I will fight for your right to choose your way. I may have an opinion as to the right way, but the choice is yours. Our government should embody that principle.\n \n EF",

   "I think a major point gets missed when discussing the religious convictions of the founders of the Constitution. Most of the Founders were indeed believers. If Jefferson, Madison, Washington, etc. were not exactly devout Christians, so what? The point is that most of the crafters and proponents of the Constitution were Protestants and believed in God and Christ and thought religion was a very good idea.\n \n That makes it all the more profound that they wanted a religious nation and a religious people, but yet a secular government. This is a great achievement and a unique break from the past. These very smart folks recognized that a secular government is the best guarantee of religious freedom for everyone. They has witnessed what had gone on in Europe and wanted a change from that. \n \n There is a great deal of evidence that the writings of John Locke, the Enlightenment philosopher had a great deal of influence in this. Locke envisioned a new kind of secular government that would have no influence on religion at all, except the free exercise thereof. \n \n Thus, you take a bunch of religious guys and they write a Constitution that has no mention of God, faith, or Christ at all. This cannot be considered anything other than a purposeful omission. There is no mention of religion at all until the first ten Amendments were tacked on (and only in the first), except, to add insult to injury, in Article VI in which there is a prohibition of a religious test for government members.\n \n This caused a huge upset in all the 13 states who had to ratify this document (9/13 were needed.) In 11 of the 13, there already existed religious test laws, in which one had to be a Protestant to hold office. There was a huge debate about this, and the votes to ratify were very close.\n \n In every state convention, there was a great outcry against the omission of a religious purpose in our Constitution. They wanted references of God and Christ to be included and the inclusion of the religious test. There was a huge fear that a papist, Jew, Mohammedan or infidel would be elected. Horrors! At each turn, the proponents of the Constitution said \"No.\" This was a remarkable achievement and unique in history. \n \n Thus, you had religious people consciously omitting any reference to God or religion in the document despite an enormous opposition. I think this can be read as a clear sign that the Founders wanted a secular government.\n\n \n Not bad, but you sort of blew it there at the end. I think the following from the Supreme Court captures what I'm talking about<b></b>:\n \n \"The State may not establish a 'religion of secularism' in the sense of affirmatively opposing or showing hostility to religion, thus 'preferring those who believe in no religion over those who do believe.' \" Abington School District v. Schempp\n \n To clarify further, while a secular-style government was somewhat the framework that was sought, there remains the clear and distinct fact that the acknowledgment of God in government affairs or by government officials was fairly well commonplace. History shows numerous quotations by the fathers concerning God, the Bible, etc., in the Constitutional Congress, in the creation of House Chaplains, in allowing religious services in government buildings, etc. It was not a totally secularized government that was envisioned but one in which, if elected officials and candidates desired, the acknowledgment of God would not be declared hostile or foreign to traditional American values or government. It was also to include freedom of religious expression, and not just apart from government.",

You insist that you'll believe what he wrote. But I showed that what he wrote does not support your presentation of what he wrote. Nevertheless, you insist that you're actually believing your presentation of what he wrote...\n I nail you for referring to Jackson as a Founding Father when he had essentially no input in the formation of the federal government and no direct knowledge of the process.\n \n And finally, it took you until now to come up with the above \"substantive\" response, and we're not forgetting the two times you \"addressed\" my post without actually adressing anything in my post.\n \n Keep it coming, EZ.

   "\n I think it's stunningly clear that the founders absolutely felt that to protect the free practice of religion, one needs to have it formally absent in government.\n\n \n Define \"in government\"? Is the mention or services of God / Christ in government facilities part of your definition? I hope not, because the fathers certainly didn't practice that. \n \n Reserved Seats at Capitol Services\n \n Here is a description, by an early Washington \"insider,\" Margaret Bayard Smith (1778-1844), a writer and social critic and wife of Samuel Harrison Smith, publisher of the National Intelligencer, of Jefferson's attendance at church services in the House of Representatives: \"Jefferson during his whole administration was a most regular attendant. The seat he chose the first day sabbath, and the adjoining one, which his private secretary occupied, were ever afterwards by the courtesy of the congregation, left for him.\"\n \n The Old House of Representatives\n \n Church services were held in what is now called Statuary Hall from 1807 to 1857. The first services in the Capitol, held when the government moved to Washington in the fall of 1800, were conducted in the \"hall\" of the House in the north wing of the building. In 1801 the House moved to temporary quarters in the south wing, called the \"Oven,\" which it vacated in 1804, returning to the north wing for three years. Services were conducted in the House until after the Civil War. The Speaker's podium was used as the preacher's pulpit. \n \n A Millennialist Sermon Preached in Congress\n \n This sermon on the millennium was preached by the Baltimore Swedenborgian minister, John Hargrove (1750-1839) in the House of Representatives. One of the earliest millennialist sermons preached before Congress was offered on July 4, 1801, by the Reverend David Austin (1759-1831), who at the time considered himself \"struck in prophesy under the style of the Joshua of the American Temple.\" Having proclaimed to his Congressional audience the imminence of the Second Coming of Christ, Austin took up a collection on the floor of the House to support services at \"Lady Washington's Chapel\" in a nearby hotel where he was teaching that \"the seed of the Millennial estate is found in the backbone of the American Revolution.\"\n \n First Catholic Sermon in the House\n \n On January 8, 1826, Bishop John England (1786-1842) of Charleston, South Carolina, became the first Catholic clergyman to preach in the House of Representatives. The overflow audience included President John Quincy Adams, whose July 4, 1821, speech England rebutted in his sermon. \n \n Woman Preacher in the House (and call for revival!)\n \n In 1827, Harriet Livermore (1788-1868), the daughter and granddaughter of Congressmen, became the second woman to preach in the House of Representatives. The first woman to preach before the House (and probably the first woman to speak officially in Congress under any circumstances) was the English evangelist, Dorothy Ripley (1767-1832), who conducted a service on January 12, 1806. Jefferson and Vice President Aaron Burr were among those in a \"crowded audience.\" Sizing up the congregation, Ripley concluded that \"very few\" had been born again and broke into an urgent, camp meeting style exhortation, insisting that \"Christ's Body was the Bread of Life and His Blood the drink of the righteous.\"\n \n Communion Service in the Treasury Building\n \n Manasseh Cutler here describes a four-hour communion service in the Treasury Building, conducted by a Presbyterian minister, the Reverend James Laurie: \"Attended worship at the Treasury. Mr. Laurie alone. Sacrament. Full assembly. Three tables; service very solemn; nearly four hours.\" \n \n Adams's Description of a Church Service in the Supreme Court\n \n John Quincy Adams here describes the Reverend James Laurie, pastor of a Presbyterian Church that had settled into the Treasury Building, preaching to an overflow audience in the Supreme Court Chamber, which in 1806 was located on the ground floor of the Capitol. \n \n The Old Supreme Court Chamber\n \n Description of church services in the Supreme Court chamber by Manasseh Cutler (1804) and John Quincy Adams (1806) indicate that services were held in the Court soon after the government moved to Washington in 1800.\n \n Church Services in Congress after the Civil War\n \n Charles Boynton (1806-1883) was in 1867 chaplain of the House of Representatives and organizing pastor of the First Congregational Church in Washington, which was trying at that time to build its own sanctuary. In the meantime the church, as Boynton informed potential donors, was holding services \"at the Hall of Representatives\" where \"the audience is the largest in town. . . .nearly 2000 assembled every Sabbath\" for services, making the congregation in the House the \"largest Protestant Sabbath audience then in the United States.\" The First Congregational Church met in the House from 1865 to 1868. \n \n House of Representatives, After the Civil War\n \n The House moved to its current location on the south side of the Capitol in 1857. It contained the \"largest Protestant Sabbath audience\" in the United States when the First Congregational Church of Washington held services there from 1865 to 1868. \n \n Compliments: United States Library of Congress\n \n http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/religion/rel06-2.html",

   "Originally Posted by Easyrider  First answer my previous question that you've avoided so far on how I supposedly defamed Jefferson's character? \n \n Electrolyte: How about I don't....\n \n How about you can't?\n \n Listen, electrolyte, you and yours can sit there all day and deny all the Godly / Christian influences in the founding of this country, in the mention of Christ or God, etc., in all the earliest state Constitutions, and seek to minimalize those and a thousand other things that totally shoot down your wannabee secular idealogy of the fathers, but the fact remains, as the United States Library of Congress states so clearly below, that you are beating a dead horse. From my previous link: \n \n THE STATE BECOMES THE CHURCH:\n JEFFERSON AND MADISON\n \n It is no exaggeration to say that on Sundays in Washington during the administrations of Thomas Jefferson (1801-1809) and of James Madison (1809-1817) the state became the church. Within a year of his inauguration, Jefferson began attending church services in the House of Representatives. Madison followed Jefferson's example, although unlike Jefferson, who rode on horseback to church in the Capitol, Madison came in a coach and four. Worship services in the House--a practice that continued until after the Civil War--were acceptable to Jefferson because they were nondiscriminatory and voluntary. Preachers of every Protestant denomination appeared. (Catholic priests began officiating in 1826.) As early as January 1806 a female evangelist, Dorothy Ripley, delivered a camp meeting-style exhortation in the House to Jefferson, Vice President Aaron Burr, and a \"crowded audience.\" Throughout his administration Jefferson permitted church services in executive branch buildings. The Gospel was also preached in the Supreme Court chambers.\n \n Jefferson's actions may seem surprising because his attitude toward the relation between religion and government is usually thought to have been embodied in his recommendation that there exist \"a wall of separation between church and state.\" In that statement, Jefferson was apparently declaring his opposition, as Madison had done in introducing the Bill of Rights, to a \"national\" religion. In attending church services on public (government - EZ) property, Jefferson and Madison consciously and deliberately were offering symbolic support to religion as a prop for republican government. \n \n http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/religion/rel06-2.html\n \n Finally, and note my previous challenge, were you ever able to come up with even five deist founding fathers who believed (1) in no revealed religion, (2) who believed that God did not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations? Why not? How about five atheist founding fathers? Or how about even five founding fathers who supported sodomy between two men? Fact is your modern day liberalism / secularism is a far cry from the beliefs of the fathers who founded this great nation and who attended church services in government facilities. \n \n And finally, John Locke (1632-1704), who was very influential among the fathers, said:\n \n \"The Law of Nature stands as an eternal rule to all men, legislators as well as others. The rules that they make for other men's actions must . . . be conformable to the Law of Nature, i.e., to the will of God. Laws human must be made according to the general laws of Nature, and without contradiction to any positive law of Scripture, otherwise they are ill made.\n Locke, Two Treatises on Government, Bk II sec 135. (quoting Hooker's Ecclesiastical Polity, 1.iii, \u00a7 9 )\n \n There's just too much for you to try to sweep it all under the rug or seek to minimalize it.",

   "Originally Posted by Easyrider First answer my previous question that you've avoided so far on how I supposedly defamed Jefferson's character?\n \n Electrolyte: How about I don't....\n \n How about you can't?\n\n How about you quit your pathetic quote mining?\n How about I don't, considering I asked you those two questions well before you pulled this Jefferson XXXX?\nDid you think I'd forget that I asked you an actually relevant question, and you ignored it repeatedly? I could pull the same childish whining and accuse you of not being able to answer my questions, but I needn't even do that; you're making yourself look idiotic all by yourself.\n \n But, just because it's so damn much fun, I'll reiterate:\n My last post roasted the absolute hell out of you. How badly were you roasted? You didn't reply to any of my points. Not one.\n \n \nListen, electrolyte, you and yours can sit there all day and deny all the Godly / Christian influences in the founding of this country...\n\n Listen, sleazy, you can sit there all day and avoid my points like the pathetic debator you actually are, and you can sit there and try to \"disprove\" me on points that I never made, nobody besides yourself thinks you're scoring any points whatsoever. See below.\n \n \nIt is no exaggeration to say that on Sundays in Washington during the administrations of Thomas Jefferson (1801-1809) and of James Madison (1809-1817) the state became the church. Within a year of his inauguration, Jefferson began attending church services in the House of Representatives.\n\n This is far from a state endorsement of religion. A Christian group may ask a government entity (e.g. a public school) for permission to use the grounds, and permission may be granted so long as no sectarian prejudice is used. And as your article points out, the services were both nondiscriminatory and voluntary.\n \n \nIn attending church services on public (government - EZ) property, Jefferson and Madison consciously and deliberately were offering symbolic support to religion as a prop for republican government.\n\n The author is a XXXXX: See above.\n \n \nFinally, and note my previous challenge, were you ever able to come up with even five deist founding fathers who believed (1) in no revealed religion, (2) who believed that God did not involve himself in the affairs of men and nations? Why not?\n\n Why? I never claimed as much, although it is clear that the Fathers were not nearly as far up on the Christianity scale as you'd like. Like I said, you're so desperate to score points, you're pretending I've said things that I really haven't.\n \n \nOr how about even five founding fathers who supported sodomy between two men?\n\n What does this have to do with anything? You just enjoy thinking about sodomy between two men?\n \n \nAnd finally, John Locke (1632-1704), who was very influential among the fathers, said:\n \n \"The Law of Nature stands as an eternal rule to all men, legislators as well as others. The rules that they make for other men's actions must . . . be conformable to the Law of Nature, i.e., to the will of God. Laws human must be made according to the general laws of Nature, and without contradiction to any positive law of Scripture, otherwise they are ill made.\n Locke, Two Treatises on Government, Bk II sec 135. (quoting Hooker's Ecclesiastical Polity, 1.iii, \u00a7 9 )\n\n Here's the end of Section 135 of Two Treatises:Thus the law of Nature stands as an eternal rule to all me, legislators as well as others. The rules that they make for, other men's actions must, as well as their own and other men's actions, be conformable to the law of Nature - i.e., the will of God, of which that is a declaration, and the fundamental law of Nature being the preservation of mankind, no human sanction can be good or valid against it.\n\n End of Section 135.There is no mention of \"Scripture\" in the entire chapter, Mr. Thou Shalt Not Bear False Witness.\n \n \nThere's just too much for you to try to sweep it all under the rug or seek to minimalize it.\n\n So you're quoting Jackson and forging quotes from Locke while I'm providing complete quotes from actual Founding Fathers like Jefferson and Adams. But you think I have trouble minimalizing the hogwash you make up? Well, at least fabrication is different than mining. Either way, though, you're still pathetic.",

   "Well, apparently Admin has been unable to stop your sophomoric name calling (\"sleazy,\" sleazyliar,\" etc.) and other ad hominems.\n\n Actually, admin edited my post and left \"sleazy\" in there. Then my next post omitted the edited moniker, despite its accuracy, and used the word that passed admin's editing last time. Then admin deleted the post despite my reasonably having the impression that \"sleazy\" passed admin's name-calling test. Go figure.\n \n \nYou been edited and have had a least one and possibly two of your postings deleted for it, and yet you still continue.\n\n What I find interesting is that posts here are supposed to be \"friendly and informative,\" yet your posts are filled with lies and half-truths. You post these lies despite being told explicitly that what you have posted is untrue. In fact, your statements are so far away from reality, you have been completely unable to defend your balderdash and instead have resorted to calling me a revisionist for posting complete, accurate posts, and making statements about how I'll get what's coming to me in the end. That is certainly not informative.

The conclusion the author of your source draws is a non-sequitur, and I pointed that out, complete with reasoning. Instead of explaining why that conclusion follows, you've done nothing but call me a revisionist.\n \n \nand you continue to deny the stong influences of Christianity and the Bible in the formation of our nation.\n\n But whether Christianity had any influence is not at issue here. You can't show that your position is correct merely by repeatedly stamping your foot on the floor and yelling that you are correct. You can't show that your position is correct by fabricating quotes from Founding Fathers. You can't show that your position is correct by ignoring legitimate quotes from Founding Fathers. You can't show that your position is correct by referring to an article that contains terrible fallacies. And you certainly can't show that your position is correct by ignoring each and every refutation of your ridiculous points that have been posted in this thread.\n \n \nI don't feel a need or a desire to continue with your ad hominems and politically-correct revisionism.\n\n You still can't say what you mean. What you really mean is that you don't feel the need to have every one of your attempts at making some sort of point shot down mercilessly, having your insane attempt at making this a \"Christian nation\" look even worse than it already does.

Just because someone is associated with the Library of Congress doesn't make him necessarily correct, just as someone's being President (Jackson) does make him necessarily correct.\n \n \ncasually dismissing legitimate quotations, etc., etc.,\n\n You are completely ignoring legitimate quotations.

You provided a slew of bogus quotations, and when challenged on the accuracy of these quotes, you didn't defend them. Instead, in one case, you pretended I was talking about a completely unrelated quote, even though there could be no question which quote I was talking about. You even reposted a bogus quote that I had already debunked. In other words, you posted information that you knew was false. That's what we call lying. But you have no problem at all with that, do you? No, if it's lying for Jesus, it's okay, huh?\n It is funny that you have now repeated my preferred name for you more than I have actually used it.
