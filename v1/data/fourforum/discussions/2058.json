A bit extreme but I think they would get the message over there that they really desperately need to get pounded into their heads right now.",

Not just the Fallujah incident, but America's involvement over there as a whole? Has any good come of this? Did we do the right thing? Or are we just evil imperialists trying to suppress the poor Arabs?\n\n \n I know what they did. I've seen worse. If you are that outraged by it, that is good, because this is the reality of war and it is about time that people woke up to it.\n \n Luckily, they were already dead, apparently they died quickly. It is also disgusting when little kids are blown apart by cluster bombs. We don't show that part on the news, though. War is a pretty disgusting thing in general and frankly I am more concerned by dead kids than by grown men who knew the risk and chose to take it. It certainly is not Americas fault that this happened, it is just what happens during wars. Have you ever been in a combat zone? \n \n I spent too much time in Sierra Leonne (look it up) during the worst part of the conflict. I saw plenty of kids who were permanently disfugured, missing eyes, limbs, blown apart, burned, cut up, beat to hell amd just generally smashed. That bothers me a LOT. They didn't sign up to take risks, they just happen to be there. Civilian casualties always bother me more than military casualties. A soldier cashes his check and does the job he is paid for. If they get killed, it is because they chose that profession knowing full well what they were signing up for. \n \n I have a real problem with how the media has handled this war. These are the first time you have really seen gory details or really nasty pictures. This is not the first time there has been nasty, gory stuff to report. Watch TV and you get the idea that this was has been a bunch of \"precision guided munitions\" being dropped on tanks and military buildings. While I am certain that measures have been taken to minimize civilian casualties, the American media doesn't seem real inclined to give dead women and children much mention. I think what we need is vietnam style coverage. Roving reporters (none of this \"embedded\" ****) sending back noteworthy pictures that show the reality of war, because the reality of war is something that people seem to have trouble getting their heads around. \n \n Somebody a while back posted that 10,000 civilian casualtes was acceptable, and they they though that 3 times that number was acceptable. This is obviously somebody who has never loaded the back of a truck with civilia bodies. You can fit roughly 300 bodies in the back of a truck if you stack them carefully and fill the voids with various pieces and parts. I feel sorry for every single one of those dead civilians. Dead soldiers don't particularly bother me. IT is terrible that anybody has to die, but I would rather have 10,000 dead soldiers and 600 dead civilians.\n \n I don;t kow if we are doing much good there or not. It is really tough to tell. Right now, YES. Saddam is gone, water and power are coming back online, people are being treated like actual people. Things are definatly better for the moment. What will happen later? Who knows. \n \n Did we do the right thing? I don't know. Personally, I think there might have been better ways to handle it. I don't think we needed a war, I think we needed an assasination. It appeared that the Iraqi ruling council was trying to be reasonable when they realised that they were in serious trouble. Saddam seemed to be the big hold out. I think an assasination was in order, then, with saddam gone, we could have seen how the winds blew. I know a few guys who would have been willing to do it, and for a lot less than the price of a single apache helicopter. \n \n I for one am against war unless ALL other alternatives have been exhausted, and I don;t feel that in this case they were. That is just my personal view based on first hand experience with war. OF course, it a lot easier to ignite a national wave of patriotism if you have a real war than it is if you have the guy shot on the toilet.\n \n I don't know if it was right or wrong. I don't know if the war will ultimatly turn out to be a good thing or a bad thing. What I DO know is that as long as we have troops in Iraq, we can expect to take casualties and there will continue to be attacks like this. I also know, or at least am told by the people I know who are over there, that the \"foreign fighters\" **** they keep harping on is mostly just that, ****. My understanding is that while there are some foreign fighters on the ground, the majority of the attacks are being carried out by normal Iraqi citizens.\n \n I know they took a poll that says most Iraqis just love us. If you lived somewere that disagreeing or criticizing the government meant prison or death for the last several years (even before Saddam) and somebody walked up to you and said \"what do you think of these new folks with the big guns?\" What would you say? I certainly hope you would be smart enough to smile and say \"they are great guys\".\n \n I am not saying that all Iraqis hate or are attacking American troops, but each of those 10,000 dead civilians was somebodys mother, or father, or child, or brother. If I killed your kid, how many chocolate bars would I have to give you before you forgot about it? It is easy for us to sit here and say that when an american bomb falls out of an american plane and kills an Iraqi kid, it is saddams fault. IT is easy because you are not the one with the dead kid. If you were the one with the dead kid, I would almost bet that you would be a little miffed at both Saddam AND the Americans, and saddam is gone, which leaves the Americans holding the bag.",

   "I respect your post, daewoo. I also agree that civilian deaths are worse than soldier deaths, though I wonder what some of the death tolls were like under Saddam. Realize that we have organizations that will go into Iraq as soon as it's more secure and will help these people through food, medicine, and everyday objects such as blankets and eyeglasses. While war is a regrettable path to take, sometimes it is the only path that can be taken. You mentioned assassination. I'm not sure if the US is legally allowed to do that, and the resulting power struggles with a still active military may have plunged the country into a deeper, more brutal civil war. \n \n Also, I would like to see the distribution of deaths, both civilian and military, around Iraq. I would not be surprised to see them concentrated around former Suuni strongholds, like Falluja. The reason is that these places are desperate. They have been oppressing the country and have been closely linked to Saddam and so have much to lose with a change in power. The only way I can see to avoid future deaths is to quarantine these cities, building barbed wire and checkpoints around them to keep the people in and away from the soldiers. It might cut down on casualties, but I highly doubt that anyone will give in soon.",

I gotta say, what you said about \"Dead soldiers don't particularly bother me\" flat out sickens me. Soldiers are human beings. Every single one of those 600 had a father and a mother.

I think about what would happen to my family and my girlfriend if they saw me on the news like this, and I'm ready to cry.

THis particularly bothers me, though, ansd sometimes I start talking (or typing) about this subject and have trouble stopping.\n \n I don;t think a power vacume would have been a problem. I think it would have been a simple enough matter to go ahead and mass our troops at the borders, have Hussein assasinated, claim credit for it, then inform the governing council that wea re sending in our troops as \"peacekeepers\" and that anybody who tried to bolster resistance or assume his position would meet the same fate. You might even imply that we already have people in place in key positions ready and willing to take care of those who who would defy us.\n \n We don;t use assasinations as a tool in such situations however effective it may be because it is generally considered \"uncivilised\". It is \"uncivilized\" becasue political leaders are usually spineless weasels who will order thousands of soldiers to combat, shake their heads in remorse at thousands of civilian casualties, then go home and hop into bed with their wives. If you make assasinations an acceptable tool, then those same political leaders actually have to worry about their safety. It is exactly the same as the prohibition against targeting officers during the revolutionary war. Officers donlt want to get killed, so if you have the opportunity to sit down and come up with some rules for war, of course the officers that do it are going to try to protect themselves. Dying for a cause is the glorious duty of the common trash, not officers or political leaders (though the prohibition against killing officers has been lifted, since officers are no longer wealthy citizens out for kicks). \n \n \nYour point about most of the attacks being carried out by Iraqi civilians, like what mostly happened in Fallujah. It's not killing civilians which is despicable, it's killing innocents. These people aren't innocent. Innocents are people like the small kids with arms and legs blown off, and heads bandaged, that they do show on the news. I feel bad every single time I see that.\n\n \n You must not be in America. We don;t see much of injured or dead innocents. I have yet to see a civilian body count on any of the major news channels, except once or twice as a 2 minute sidebar. You are right, of course, civilia combatants are, as far as I am concerned, lumped right in there with soldiers, they made a choice which they knew may very well result in their death. \n \n \nYes, the Americans did know the risk. Guess what? I'm still just as upset that they died. I gotta say, what you said about \"Dead soldiers don't particularly bother me\" flat out sickens me. Soldiers are human beings. Every single one of those 600 had a father and a mother. Most of them had girlfriends, wives, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters. I think about what would happen to my family and my girlfriend if they saw me on the news like this, and I'm ready to cry. Most nights, I watch the News Hour with Jim Lehrer, and at the end of every program they have a silent tribute to the American soldiers confirmed dead that day, showing their name, age, hometown, and a picture. They're no less human than the civilians you talk about.\n\n \n You are right that soldiers are human beings and that their deaths do count. IF there is going to be a war with casualties, they are the ones who should die. I too feel sorry for their families, especially their children. My comapssion for their wives is pretty limited. They married a military man, they should have accepted the possibilities that come with that. I have trouble dredging up sympathy for people who choose to put themselves in harms way. IF you were talking about a draft situation, that would be a different matter. We have a volunteer army. As a soldier you take the money, you do the job, and you accept everything that comes with that job up to and including death.",

   "I am in America actually, and damn proud of it. I think it was NBC which had a special one night going through an Iraqi hospital, showing pictures of children among the wounded. Most of the major networks did as well, I believe.\n \n I agree that in a war, only the combatants should be involved in the fighting. They are soldiers by choice and by profession, and they do accept those risks. That doesn't mean we should somehow not mourn the loss of every single one of them. That doesn't mean that the war is okay, because it's only uniformed soldiers who are hurt and die. I'm sorry man, I hear about a dead Iraqi child and an American soldier who was KIA, and I feel terrible for both of them, and equally so. Just because you wear fatigues and carry a gun doesn't mean that your death is insignificant or somehow less important than somebody elses.\n \n Again, I entirely disagree with you about the military wives. I have nothing but compassion for them. See, it's not about 'hey should have known the risks' or 'they married a military man.' What matters is the fact that their husbands wre killed half a world away. Their husbands are no less human than a dead Iraqi innocent.",

It took, images of the my-lai massacre to drive home what was happening to Vietnamese in Vietnam. \n \n \n Exactly my point.

IT is also an incident that most definatly can not be attributed to shadowy and in many cases fictional \"foreign fighters\". \n \n \nThis massacre was perpetrated on Americans, and I hope Americans see the images and either resolve to finish the job or get the heck out. \n \n \n My personal feeling is that we should never have been there, but now that we are there we need to finish what we started. I think that America has enough to worry about just taking care of AMerica, lets let the rest of the world take care of themselves. I dont think in the end that our intervention is going to do as much good as people would hope. I think Dinesh D&#8217;Souza said it best:\n \n \"If the supply of virtue is insufficient in a free society like America, it is almost nonexistent in Islamic societies because coerced virtues are not virtues at all.\"\n \n I think one of the biggest problems we have with our foreign policy is that our politicians look at things through American eyes and endeavor to make things beter elesewhere in the world. My personal belief is that isolationism might not be such a bad thing. I have heard many people explain why isolationism simply will not work, but have yet to hear anybody actually explain why isolationism will not work. Usually the explantion I have heard have to do with protecting AMerican business interests abroad. I find it ironic that these same folks, who generally are willing to spend hours on end discussing the benifits of capitolism and the free market system, feel we need to have our military dispersed acrss the planet in order to ensure that we have a market advantage.\n \n I am reminded of a quote by John Quincy Adams:\n \n \"[America] does not go abroad in search of monsters to destroy. She is the well-wisher to the freedom and independence of all. She well knows that by enlisting under other banners than her own, were they even the banners of foreign independence, she would involve herself beyond the power of extrication in all the wars of interest and intrigue, of individual avarice, envy and ambition, which assume the colors and usurp the standards of freedom.\"\n \n The part I find particularly interesting in light of current events is \"she would involve herself beyond the power of extrication\". HEre we are, fighting a vaugly defined \"war on terror\" against an enemy that is almost impossible to defeat due to their construction. Will we simply have to fight this war forever, knocking over one little nothing country after another? I also find that particular statement oddly prophetic. Since vietnam, we have been involved in countless little regional skirmishes all over the globe, and we never seem to actually get all our troops back. We still have troops in bosnia, and that was allegedly over YEARS ago. WE still have troops in Korea, and the politician who led us into that one are all dying of old age now.\n \n \nDaewoo, I like the quotes at the bottom of your posts.\n\n \n Thank you.

   "Ordinarily Im happy to sit and read the kinds of farcical, indefensible arguments being promulgated by several contributors here. Indeed, its fair to say thats the very beauty of democracy. Daewoo you are excluded!! \n However, I am frustrated enough today to pose this sarcastic, button pushing piece.\n \n Seems to me. a non US resident who has been lucky enough to grow up in a free democratic society, that the leaders of the free world today have managed to pull off the greatest snow job in the history of mankind...inventing a war for the sake of inventing a diversion, an enemy without merit so to speak. Its all a bit funny actually. Not in a funny ha ha kinda way...in a funny, I cant believe how plainly stupid and gullible and unwilling to take responsibility, so may of you are, kinda way. \n \n Sure you can go on and on about how nasty a guy Mr Hussein was, and how nasty Mr Bin Laden may be ...and of course you MUST as Americans believe the hyperbole surrounding how much better a lifestyle anyone must enjoy by having McDonalds and Coca-Cola,and Nike provide them with their food, beverages and clothing. You can go on and on about the moral high ground, the fact that as a responsible world superpower you hold an inherent responsibility to look after the weak...the less fortunate. You can go on and on about how collateral damage in war is acceptable, when you dish it out. (But interestingly not when the other party to the agreement insists on it being reciprocal!!!!) You can go on and on about oh so many ridiculously weak, disjointed, uninformed and essentially DUMB arguments , all you like. But be careful to consider the many many many many many other nations who dont have vast oil reserves within their sovereign borders, with whom your Government has and continues to demonstrate a remarkable devotion to NOT aiding, before advocating that position too enthusiastically.\n \n People, this has been an exercise in energy control. Or in simnpler terms, its been the worlds biggest corporation bullying its way around the globe using its tough guys (armed services) to do the work for them. \n \n The point is unbelievably simple. Simple enough that even nationalistic, one solution fits all Hoo-ya'd Marine loving fools should be able to comprehend. You reap what you sow folks. As a nation, your continued, unabated greed (4% world pop, something like 70% energy consumers) is the issue youd probaly be best advised to address. It probably wouldnt hurt to appear a little less hypocritical over Israel either. Or any matter, come to think of it. In the 80s when Russia tried to get its hand on Afghanistan, YOU created Mr Bin Ladens capacity to blow things up, and get things done. Keep the Ruskies out ! Yes siree...he was MADE IN THE USA.Similarly, your obnoxiously conceited secretary of defence Donnie boy Rumsfield was all too happy to take the photo ops with Mr Hussein around that time. MADE IN THE USA. Noriega...MADE IN THE USA....etc etc etc Need I go on? No need, Michael Moore did it so much more diligently than I ever could.\n \n I realise theres a strong belief that the holier than thou, God fearing, white bread eating All American way of life is for all of us, and that it is clearly the way the world MUST live. I lived in your country for three years and I understand its how you are raised. Indoctrinated almost. But its amazing to find when you leave the borders of your otherwise wonderful land that the REST of the world, all 95-96% of us, may not quite subscribe to that view. We dont believe that the biggest bombs make the best negotiators, necessarily. \n \n Clearly your administration believes Dubya's way is best though, in spite of the remarkable lack of evidence produced against just about anyone or anything since September 11. Hmm...no WMD's yet, but then again its amazing how quickly we can make the public forget about that...just spin the next story. No real charges against any of the illegally detained Guantanamo \"combatants\"...please please please. Ooh they werent detained llegally were they, as your nation refused to sign the International Criminal Court treaty obliging them to behave within agreed standards, did they? Ooh, on that theme, you kinda ignored the UN too didnt you? Nor Kyoto protocol....oh the list is far too long to go on. Can a nation behave any more oboxiously???? And you wonder why the kinds of things that happened in Falluja happen. Oh my GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD...like! Whateverrrrrr.\n PLEASE. Spare me the entertainment. Take responsibility for the fact that YOU can control the way the world lives, breathes and interacts by stepping DOWN , not UP. As a parent would you raise your children to behave this way. NO NO NO For a nation that unashamedly believes itself to be God fearing and blessed, you show a remarkable ability to bully when the referee is not watching, but refuse to turn the other cheek when you get smacked back. Some may call that cowardly, not heroic. Some may find it offensive enough to develop a dep, generational loathing of your foreign policy. Some might argue your actions simply fuel that fire.\n \n No one believes anyone is more to blame than anyone else here. Its a chicken and egg argument. But only one party in this circumstance has the ability to demonstrate leadership and alter the current way of thw world. If only these kinds of resources could be justified to help your minorities and homeless, carless, foodless starving masses in your own land. If only your politicians called Sharon the mass murdering disgrace he and Israeli PM's before him have been...if only. Ah, I can dream cant I. But thats all Im doing, because at the end of the day, OIL money and Jewish money control the way your little corporation conducts itself offshore, behind the scenes, out of view of its well trained, well deceived employees, the American people.\n \n So I guess when considering Falluja, consider these things before advocating the one size fits all solution so often used as an American fallback...lets nuke em or lets level em or lets whetever....HOO-YA! People like O'Reilly are just sphincters. Clueless and ill conceived. Imagine if he was making decisions and calling the shots. He did see Schindlers List right? He has heard of the holocaust? Genocide? Murder? call it what you will. You all agree it wasnt the poster child for civil, human like behaviour? The way the Nazi's marched ppl outta their homes and...wait, does that sound like anything YOU are considering doing? I am continually flabergasted by the indefensible hypocrisy of these kinds of arguments. Look closely in the mirror...ask whether you are really being all you can be....before you divert your anger to the ppl NOT driving the circumstance in which they find themselves. Put on your Nikes, drive your 6 litre V8 50 meters down the street to get a bottle of coke, and \n Oh My Goooooooood...like, whateverrrrrrrrrrrrr!",

The \"thousands of dollars of technical training\" will get you nothing in the outside world. They teach you how to service their propreitary systems. That's it.

You are right, the US is the last of the huge superpowers. That does not make us responsible for the welfare of the rest of the world. How long do you want the US to remain a superpower? You canot make enemies all over the world in the quantities that we have here in the US and expect good things to come of it. First rule of international relations.....YOu can expect your friends to speak  for you. You can expect your enemies to act  against you.\n \n \nQuoting John Quincy Adams on America's role in the world is irrelevant. America at that time was a brand new nation which needed military help from (of all places) France to win the Revolutionary War. We didn't have the ability to respond to anything back then. We're now in a different situation.\n\n \n Jesus said you should love your neiborg. IT is still valid today, even though the world has changed. Just because we CAN doesn't mean we SHOULD. It also doesn't mean that it is our responsibility to do so.\n \n \nAnd as for your claim that the military never seems to leave a place it goes to, you're right (mostly).

I agree that there will also be some people willing to risk their lives for money, but now it might cost more PLUS take longer and be harder to do than initially thought.\n\n \n It was always going to take longer than originally thought. It always does. American politicians, press and citizens make an almost pathetic habit of over estimating the capabilities of the American militry. Sure, we can roll tanks across a country, shoot cruise missiles that can hit a single guy in a hidden toilet. We can drop daisey cutter bombs, bunker busters, and even nukes if we are so inclined. We can roll right over the oppositions military. \n \n The problem comes once you have ousted the former government and have to deal with an often hostile civilian population. You have your supporters, and you have your dissenters. the longer the occupation takes, the more dissenters you have. THer is not a whole lot the military can do in a situation like that, short of house to house searches, which we don;t have the manpower to do, nor are we willing ot take the casualties such an activity would inevitably bring.\n \n WE look at stuff like what is going on in Iraq through American eyes. Unfortuanatly, the IRaqis don't. It is easy for us to sit at home and watch it on the news, from a completely detached viewpoint and armchair quarterback the whole thing. It is a lot different when you are on the ground. Did we liberate the Iraqi people? Quite possibley, it depends on who you are asking. Did we invade their counry? MOst definatly, and that is not open for debate. No matter where you are in the world, or who your government is, the thought of somebody invading your country is generally going to make you a little queasy.",

Vast empires are formed, live for a while, decline, and inevitably fall. The one thing that is common to empires from the byzantine empire to modern America is the method of failure. In every case, the government has gotten too big, the military has gotten too overextended, and they have eventually collapsed under their own weight. \n \n The British honestly believed they were bringing civilization to uncivilized people. They believed in their way of life, and their values, and did the best they could to spread them throughout the globe. The Romand belived in their culture and values and spread their society across the globe as a result of their beliefs in those values. Both Empires expanded in order to facilitate trade, in order to bolster their economies. What America is doing and has done in recent years is the exact same as what the romans did and what the british did. We have our set ov values and attempt to spread it around the world. \n \n \nHussein was a bad guy, but I'm sure that in your twisted little view of the world, it's Bush who is the real bastard in this situation, right? Yeah, Osama slaughtered 3,000 innocents, but who cares, it's really just our fault anyway, we shouldn't have ticked him off.\n\n \n Bin Laden and hussein don;t really belong in the same comparison, since they are 2 entirely seperate issues. Bin Laden is a terorist who sees the US as a threat to his culture and his people, so he has struck out against the US. Hussein was the president of his own country, which we invaded due to an imagened threat. \n \n Hussein was, by our standards, a bad guy. It seems that in his own country, he was not considered such a wretched fellow. In his region (the middle east) he was seen by many as the defender of the middle east against israel. \n \n THere is a cycle that we can see throughout history when it comes to dealing with tyrants like hussein. A tyrannical government rises, rules for a while, then falls to the people, who install a popular governement (which it seems alwas eventually becomes tyranical). WHat the US seems determined to do is to break this cycle. We go in, take down the tyranicla government, install a government of our own pattern, and then expect the population at large to be grateful to us. The problem with this plan is that a lot of time, the population is not real fond of being invaded, then having their government formed by outsiders and forced on them. They seem to want to pick their own government, and the type of government. Silly people.\n \n \nAs far as the situation in Fallujah and the ensuing comments on this forum...grow up and realize that we're venting a little. I don't believe that anyone here truly believes that we should level Fallujah or kill it's entire population. We're angry that 4 Americans were brutally killed and mutilated. Damn straight we want a little bit of revenge. And I'd just like to point out that the US Marines (those 'hoo-ya fools' you're so fond of) are right now acting in Fallujah with remarkable restraint. We're not 'marching people ot of their homes Holocaust-style (I really really hope you weren't implying that the US is like that, are you? Eh, it wouldn't surprise me if you did).\n\n \n When some folks on a forum suggest it that is one thing. When O'Reilly gets on tv and says it and is dead serious, that is something else all together. The problem is, there seems to be a lot of people in the US who think O'Reillys idea is a good one. They tend to forget that we ae the invaders there, and that anybody resisting us is not a \"terrorist\", they are doing their patriotic duty. IF Mexico decided tommorow that George Bush is a tyrant and invaded and set about to install a puppet regime, I think that Americans everywhere could be counted on to resist the invader. Even Dman, who seems to be a rabid Bush hater, could probably be counted on to help in the resistance against the invaders. \n \n \nThe funny thing is that people like you always want the US to step down, not up...but when the Nazis come marching through your cities in jack boots or the Russians are building an army on your border, it's the US you look to for help. And you know what? That help will be there, even with all of your idiotic ideology, and the reason is because it's your right as a human being to hold those idiotic thoughts, and we will protect that if you're too cowardly to do it yourself.\n\n \n The question is, has the US become the nazis? I think we stepped over the line in Iraq. We are no longer defending human rights, we have invaded aforeign nation that was no threat to the US. At what point does defender of the free world change to expansionist empire?",

Yes, the navies of France and Spain rivaled Britain's combined...but that's only two nations rivaling one. We could take on half the known world and give a good account of ourselves.\n\n \n Wrong answer, bucko. The Germans were providing half of Africa with weapons, the French were providing the other half. It was more or less a massive european land grab, and the British were way ahead. The majority of africa was not still killing pigs with sticks. In portions where they WERE still killing pigs with sticks, you are talking about the zulu. The zulu were incredibly difficult to kill. They could run all day, most were battle hardened, and they had bullet proof shields (their shield were made of rinocerous hide stretched over a framework of sticks and dried, british bullets bounced right off). The British never did manage to subjegate the zulu, neither did the french or germans. The Africans were fighting the British with modern rifles and artillery, and they did not launch sticks.\n \n I would not reccomend taking on half the known world, though from your armchair it may sound like a good idea. We haven;t done real well in the last few full scale wars we were in. Remember Vietnam and Korea?? Even now, we are having trouble with Iraq. People have a real problem with uderstanding that being able to launch a bunch of air strikes does not win you a war.\n \n \nYeah, the Syrian Baathists didn't think he was such a bad guy. Neither did Hamas or Islamic Jihad. I wouldn't exactly use their criterea to judge the guy...and what are you talking about, oil belonging to the people?

There is nothing that can be accepted or understood when your thugs are out raping and killing children, torturing people...what happened over there is akin in brutality to the Holocaust.\n\n \n This is just how the middle east is. You should visit some time. The point I was making was not that saddam was a good guy or that Iraqis were rich, simply that none of them starved to death. This may not sound like a big deal to somebody who apparently has things like a house and a computer, but to people in the middle east it IS a big deal. People in Saudi Arabia DO starve to death, as do people in every other country in the middle east. The torture, imprisonment without trial, raping, and killing children (though I am not entirely sure where you got that one) do go on everywhere in the middle east. Saudi has a fairly profitable slave trade. THe possible exception to this may be Jordan, which is a fairly progressive country.\n \n When your leader routinely involve themselves in such terrible atrocities, the guy who feeds you starts to look pretty good. THe middle east is just not a good place for government right now. Perhaps in the future things will improve (any student of history would tell you it is a sure thing). Iraq was a socialist country, and one of the first things that Saddam did was sieze the oilfields and declare them property of the state. Proceeds from the oil fields were used to fund Iraqs social programs, feed their people (most Iraqis were enrolled in their social programs since there were not enough jobs to employ all the people) and even gave them some spending money. Yes, he built a bunch of palaces, but he DID feed the people, which is much more than you can say for other leaders in te middle east who build palaces, violate their peoples human rights, and then DONT feed them.\n \n \n \nSaddam didn't have to worry about internal overthrow, he was the only one in Iraq with WMDs to use against his enemies (Kurds, for instance) and his Baathist thugs kept total control. His opposition wasn't well armed, they were up against entire mechanised divisions and they had things like AKs and RPGs...good luck facing down a tank unit with those. The opposition had no mobility, insufficient weapons, and little ability to coordinate. They never tried because most of them were tracked down, tortured, and killed. And Saddam is (was, actuallyemoticon_xgood) one of the most tyrannical :xcensoreds in the world. There is no debate about that.\n\n \n REally? Where are all those WMDs? THere is a possibility tht he might have used WMD's against his people (back in the days when he actually had some). Lets think about this for a second. The IRaqi people were armed with AK 47's and RPG's (actually, they had a lot more than that, but we will stick to those since you brought them up). The RPG's they have are type 4 RPG's, which are specifically designed to be able to take out T-72 or equivelent type tanks, which is what those \"entire mechanised divisions\" (only if your definition of \"division\" is different than mine.....what saddam has was more like \"entire mechanised squads\") were made up of (and some mechanised artilery, whihc is about useless in a civil war). HOw many tiems in all the years that Saddam ruled did even a single one of his millions of citizens take one of those RPG's and take out one of those taks, as they are specifically designed to do? None. Not one single time did a group of Iraqis try to overthrow the government (discouting hte pathetic attempt by the shia). Why not? Because these folks are in the middle east and fully expected whatever governement came along next to be just as bad. Their biggest concern was \"what if the next government desn;t feed the people?\"\n \n NOw, we can expect a shia government, and we can fully expect themselves to immediatly aling themselves with Iran. The Iraqi Shia have for years advocated forming one big state with Iran. Sure, we have made certain that there is a constitution in place protecting the minorities, but once we are gone, who is going to make them uphold that constitution? Nobody. I guess we could just stay there forever, but then our whole facade of not invading to gain long term control kind of falls apart.",

One didn't dare insulting Saddam when talking with his neighbour; because he could be a part of some Baath-subparty.\n \n Thinking about Iraq before the war with Iran (a war that was encouraged and lengthened by the West) it was the most Western country in the ME we have seen so far.

The tax load on Americans before the American Revolution was less than 4% of their gross income, and they considered it an outrage. After the revolution, taxes actually went up. For the next 150 yrs the American government operated on roughly 5% of the GDP. Today, they eat up 40% of the GDP.\n\n Today standards didn't feed people during the last century. ;)\n But I see your point and quite agree with it.\n Although I will look after the numbers about the salt reimports of India again, as far as I remember this had a countable influence on the Indian economy. Same couldgo for the tea.\n \n \n \nComedian, you have nailed my point exactly in the second part of your post. We run roughshod over the entire planet and we make enemies. America has the potential to last another couple hundred years, or to be destroyed in the next 50. You cannot make enemies on the scale that America has and not expect to have to pay for that.\n\n Strange feeling to thank for an agreement in such a sad issue.\n \n \nRegardless of what kind of dipstick saddam was, he was not our dipstick to deal with. He was not our problem to solve.\n\n I am not sure if it is not our business to remove guys like him.\n The way the US did and the time were certainly poorly chosen.",

Arms sales continued apace, as did French infrastructure projects in Iraq; by the late 1970s France was second only to the USSR as supplier of both civilian and military equipment to the Iraqis. \n \n The trend continued under French socialist governments in the 1980s.

   "\n I did;t say that the french and russians werent supplying weapons (the spin is on). OF course they were. America was supplying the money to buy the weapons. The russians were never particulalrly supportive of Iraq because of the strong support they got from America. \n \n \n minorities are also usually the ones subjected to genocides and ethnic cleansing.\n your perspective seems strange here. \n 1. if it was a real problem there would have been a popular uprising\n 2. that ethnic cleansing and genocides happens to the majority\n\n \n No, I said there was no ethnic cleansing in Iraq, not that minorities were not generally the subjects of ethnic cleansing. More spin\n \n \nyou are right\n each event is unique and comparison cannot and should not be made\n lets all forget the lessons history have taught us.\n\n \n No, lets just quite tying to apply irrelevant lessons from history to current event. I am all for learning from history. History teaches us that you cannot use military forces to effectively combat terrorism. History shows us that creating dictators all over the world is a BAD idea. History also shows us that even without external intervention a tyrannical government will eventually fail due to internal pressure.\n \n \nso lets just use generics\n 1. country A is commiting genocide\n 2. country A will not listen to diplomatic pressure; genocide continues\n 3. invading country A will only cause more deaths (from the invasion/war)\n therefore lets not make the situation worse by invading to stop genocide!\n\n \n Uh, since there was no genocide going on, how is this relevant? more spin\n \n \noh?\n so the kmer rouge were not cambodians?\n weren't they the cambodian communist insurgents?\n so if they weren't cambodians and didn't kill other cambodians can we blame the chinese and vietnamese now?\n better yet, can we blame westerners and in particular americans?!?!?\n\n \n The khemer rouge and the khemer krom are 2 different ethnic groups. They have split fairly consisently along political lines since the communist uprisings, but they are ethnic groups, not just political ones. They are all cambodians, just like Jews and some Arabs that live in Israel are all israelis This does not mean that those Arabs are jews. \n \n \nbut i am not complaining about intervening in iraq\n i support it and wish such humanitarian interventions to continue\n i just accept that innocents will die today so others will live in freedom tomorrow.\n i was planning to volunteer for bosnia but it ended. now i am too old.\n but i support the troops in other ways as i can.\n i'd ask you the same, but you don't seem to care about intervention for genocides as long as we aren't commiting them.\n\n \n You support sending our troops off to fight and die in the name of some dimly defined ideal. I doubt you are too old. There is a guy who just came home from Iraq because he just turned 65 and retired. A local guy is 58 and just got deployed. Of course, people with a great sense of \"social justice\" don;t usually survive very long in combat. Wars are for those rued by logic.\n \n When did bosnia end? We have lost 23 men in Vosnia this year. Just because it isn;t on the news any more doesn't mean it is over. \n \n It seems to me that one of the basic freedoms should be freedom from having a foreign country come in and remodel your government in their image. \n \n \nfor those without visions and commitments, all obstacles will be deemed insurmountable\n if you can't sacrifice today for a better tomorrow, what would be the point?\n\n \n I have no problem with sacrificing today for a better tommorow. What we are doing in Iraq is not sacrificing for a better tommorow, it is forcing our form of government and our values on people who find them completely alien. I was watching Forbes on Fox last night and they had a segment that illustrated this point pretty well. Ther were quite a few apparently well educated Americans who feel that the best way to end the fighting is to give each Iraqi a check for a portion of the iraqi oil. That way, they have a stake in the country and a reason to stop the fighting.\n \n What these failures of the AMerican education system seem to miss is that the oil in Iraq has been the property of the Iraqi people ever since Saddam came to power and seized it and gave it to them. There was an interesting spot an Al Jazeera this afternoon where they were talking about the segment on forbes on fox. Tey pointed out that if AMerica feels they can give the Iraqi people each a portion of the proceeds of the oil, that would imply rather strongly that we feel that we own that oil, or at least that the Iraqi people no loger own it. THey were askig under whose authrity did we seize that paticular piece of property of the Iraqi people.\n \n We could argue both sides of that one all day, but in the end it just accentuates the differences between how the arabs (iraqis) and Americans see things. You compound this by way of the fact that Iraqs are not only Arabs, theya re socialists. They have heard the same propoganda the russians heard for years, \"it all belongs to the people\". Iraq is the only country in the middle east where the citizens owned the oil fields, and I think that there is going to be some reprocussion for stupid ideas like this. Your average Iraqi who is sitting there watching this is going to be saying to himself \"Hey, when did they take the oil from us\"? and it is going to XXXX them off.\n \n Before you start invading other countries and changing them, you need to try really hard to see things thrugh their eyes. I have not spent enough time in the middle east to be able to do this entirely effectively, but I have spet enough time there and done enough research into the history of the region that occasionally I do get little glimmers, and they aint good. We have this mistaken impression that every oppresssed person in the world is just longing to live in a \"little America\"\n \n There are some pretty major problems with America that other parts of the world see that Americans seem blind to. Your typical Arab prizes personal empowerment (they don;t want or need a babysitter), they are respectful of women, they are generally a non violent people (vioent crime has neevr been a big problem in the ME). IF those were the values you prized, would you really want to model your country after America? According to the SUrgeon general, half of us are fat. We lead the western world in violent crimes and rapes (we beat out IRaq by a long shot). We run a fairly massive welfare program and \"presonal responsibiity for ones actions\" has become a dirty word. We have a massive porn industry, and are so fanatic about seperation of church and state that it is apparently worthy of national debate if a judge in backwoods alabama wishes to put a copy of the ten commandments in his courthouse. If you were an average joe arab, who holds strict moral values and believes that your leaders should look to god for guidance in all matters, would you REALLY want to turn your country into another America.\n \n America does have it's shortcomings, and to us they are not that big a deal. To people in other countries who hold different core values, theya re a HUGE deal. Why should we force our culture, our values, and our form of government on people that find them repugnant? \n \n \nmost afghans are happier under the Khabul government!\n\n \n Then why do they keep attacking it? Why does the CIA's little map that shows firendly areas in blue and non friendly areas in red keep showing up with more and more red? THe government we installed pretty much controlls the capitol city and a few major roadways. Afghanistan is another excellent example of a group of folks who just don;t want to be americans.",

A minority can't generally pull of a popular uprising (duh).\n\n \n Then what should happen, huh? If the oppressed are responsible for creating an uprising when things get bad...but the minority can't pull off an uprising...then what, chief? Keep in mind, the Kurds were a minority. The Shia, while the majority, were the oppressed, but couldn't revolt because of how firmly they were under Saddam's heel.\n \n \n \n \nWhy do people keep bringing up hitler and WWII in relation to the current Iraq situation? There is no way to make a valid comparison between an expansionist nation that is trying to conquer the westrn world and a small country in the middle east with no real military. THis is jst a rediculous comparison.\n\n \n Because, no offense, your point is ridiculous. Your train of logic would seem to suggest that any oppressed minority will rebel if it's bad enough, but you're wrong. When it gets really bad, you sap people's will to live.

   "A wonderfully articulate answer.\n\n \n Some things are just so out of whack that it is difficult to actually formulate an articulate answer. WE helped Saddam take power and provided him billions to buy weapons from the French and Russians (because we didn;t want it known that we were actively supporting him, and Abrams tanks and M-16s are definatly stamped \"made in America\"\n \n \nThen what should happen, huh? If the oppressed are responsible for creating an uprising when things get bad...but the minority can't pull off an uprising...then what, chief? Keep in mind, the Kurds were a minority. The Shia, while the majority, were the oppressed, but couldn't revolt because of how firmly they were under Saddam's heel.\n\n \n The roman empire was brought down not by a single entity, but by multiple factions which had traditionally been at each others throats uniting under a single banner. The Iraqis were unable to pull off an effective coup because they hated each other more than they hated saddam. Had things been allowed to continue on track, they eiter would have eventually united and overthrown him, or one of the groups would have taken the upper hand and assasinated him. It has been this way throughout history. Doing it this way has a distinct advantage in that it forces traditional enemies to work in concert for a common goal. After the revolution, there is generally much better internal relations. \n \n Even now we can see a micro example of this working, unfortunalty not in a way that is good for us. We are seeing exampes of Shia and Sunni extremists, who have traditionally loathed each other, working in concert to attack American forces. From a realistic standpoint, we have brought the downfall of Saddam about more quickly, but have created a country with three different groups that historically have called for each others deaths. The future of Iraq is not bright at this point. From a sociological standpoint, the war was quite possibly the worst option as far as forming a stable nation. At best we can now hope for peace in Iraq enforced at the end of a gun, which is not peace at all.\n \n \n \nBecause, no offense, your point is ridiculous. Your train of logic would seem to suggest that any oppressed minority will rebel if it's bad enough, but you're wrong. When it gets really bad, you sap people's will to live. They're not strong enough to fight, they don't have the will.\n\n \n Oddly enough, the latest examples of opression we have seen involved oppression of the majority by the minority. In Iraq, the shia are the majority. In bosnia, the serbs were doing the opressing, but they were a fairly slim minority. In Iraq, the baathists were slim minority (peopel became disillusioned with them following the hardships after the war with IRan and the trade sanctions). In Iraq, there were very few actual attempts at an overthrow because the various factions hated each other more than thy hated saddam (see above). In Bosnia, the serbs only constituted about 10 percent of the population. The uprising by the Albanians was unsucessful not because it was doomed to failure from the start, or because the people lost the will to fight. It failed because the US declared an arms embargo on bosnia so the Albanians could not get weapons or ammunition. The serbs on the other hand had all the armament that they needed. IT was not lack of will byt the albanians, but international meddling that led to their downfall. That whole mess would have been over in a month with the serbs defeated and the Albanians (the majority) in control had we not interfered. Instead we still have troops in the country, adn likely will for years to come. There is an uneasy truce enforced by peacekeepers and violence among the factios is still common, and will be for years to come. This is what we can expect in Iraq.\n \n \nHitler was doing things comparable to what Saddam was in terms of cruelty, although Hitler did it on a larger scale. Hitler never attacked the US, and he couldn't have. He couldn't invade Britain, and Britain was only a few dozen miles away and tiny. We were huge and an ocean away. It is an applicable analogy.\n\n \n Hitler was an expansionist. He was intent on taking over hte world. With Euroope defeated, he would have had more than enough resources and people to defeat America, even with us being an ocean away. With Europe safely in his pocket, he woudl have made short work of Britain. THis is why we (and the british) fought the Nazis in WWII, Hitler told us he was coming for us. A lot of people didn;t believe we were in any danger until the Jaanese hit pearl harbor. JApan is even further away than Europe, and it drove home the point that the ocean is not as great a buffer as we may have thought.\n \n What truly brought about the fall of the Nazis was lack of resources. They couldn't get enough materials and manufature enough equipment to keep their military machine running. ad they been allowed to button up all of Europe and take control of the eurpoean natural resources and harness their manufacturing capability, they would have been nearly unstoppable.\n \n CAn you really provide me with any kind of realistic scenario where Saddam Hussein ed up ruling most of the world? I think not. The scenario with Hitler was a VERY real and present danger.\n \n \n \nWe're building schools, roads, hospitals...people are opening shops, getting back to work, talking on cell phones, and drag racing is becoming the popular sport. No Baathist militiamen are killing, torturing, and raping people anymore. I'd say we sure as hell are helping.\n\n \n And under the baathist, there was power and water and some degree of security. WE are rebuilding schools and roads and hospitals that we blew up, so tha doesn't really count for much. The shops are not just opening, they are re-opening. they were closed because we were invading and we were droppig bombs on and rolling tanks through downtown baghdad. They already had cell phones and cars before we showed up on the scene (in fact, they ad more per capita than we do in America). If you hit somebody with a club and knock them down, it doesn;t make you a humanitarian if you then bend over and help them back up.\n \n As far as the Baathist militia killing, torturing and raping people, that was not an every day occurance. From what we can confirm, if you look at the number of people killd by the baathists and add it to the number of people killed in violent crimes in Iraq, you were still getting a smaller combined death rate than we have here in the US from violent crime. Here. rape in our prisons is common enough that t is a joke (send him to prison and let him be bubas b#$ch for a few years).\n \n Now that the US has taken control we are putting people in prison without charges so we can interrogate them. Some of them have been in prison for months. We are killing insurgents in the street, just like the baathists were. We recently saw Israel assasinate a guy for speaking out agauinsyt them and encouraging attacks. This is EXACTLY what the baathists were killing people for.\n \n This is what it takes to maintain control in a country where you have three differnt groups at each otehrs throats all the time, and they only hate each other a little more than they hate their rulers. Governments rule, and they become very testy when they feel that somebody may resist their authority. We have seen this right here in America. Think back to Waco. The government thought those folks had ilelgal weapons. They also thought that there was a good possibility that they would resist the goverments authority. What did our government do? They hit them wiyth overwhelming force, including the use of shock troops, armored vehicles, and snipers. Of course, it turns ut that they apparently did not actually have any illegal weapons, and there is controversy to this day about whose fault that was (though in hindsight we know that if the ATF had been entirely honest in their application for a warrant they would not have recieved one, and having ATF agents with Machine guns unloading from the back of an unmarked truck has been questioned as a good tactic....I know if I looked out in my yard and saw a bunh of guys with machine guns in plain clothes unloading in my yard there is a good chance I would open fire).\n \n At ruby ridge, those same folks thought that they had illegal weapons and that there was a good chance that they would resist the governments authority. They killed that mans wife and son with sniper fire.\n \n When they went to enforce the court order on that little cuban kid whose name I can never remember, they sent squads of paramilitary troops (whihc is what SWAT teams are) armed with machine guns, because they feared there was a chance that the governments authority would be challenged.\n \n In the above examples, our government sent shock troops (another name for SWAT teams) against American citizens because they hought there was a chance that said citizens would resist. In two of the examples, American citizens were MURDERED (that is what it is called when you kill innocent peope like weavers wife and many of thse people who were at waco) by our government. How much more extreme do you think our governments reaction would have been had they been dealing with hundreds, or even thousands of dissenters insted of just a handful? How about if they absolutly knew that the people were GOING to resist. How about if, instead of suspecting that these folks were possibly armed with illegally owned assault rifles (and I mean real assault rifles, not just the scary black guns that the GGs have labeled as such) our government absolutly knew that they were armed with assault rifles, heavy machine guns. rocket and grenade launchers and mortars?\n \n Our government had murdered its own people on the suspicion that they may be lightly armed and planning to resist government authority. How do you think our government would react if they knew absolutly that those same people were heavily armed and going to defy the governments authority. Multiply the number of \"insurgents\" in each circumstance by 1000. How would our government react? I am betting it would not be good.\n \n \nI can't speak for Fracas, though I agree with him, but I can't join the military right now. I'm in high school and I have medical conditions which might prevent me from getting in to it. I'm still likely going to try in a few years, and I've been planning on enlisting for about 6 years now\n\n \n I would highly recommend it. I would reccomend that anybody who heavily advocates putting the lives of US servicemen on the line in order to \"save\" the rest of the world should definatly be the first off the boat.\n \n I have a plan that I think would shut down a lot of the second guessing that goes on when it comes to using our troops in such a manner. I also think that it would cut down on deployments. We change the law so that deploying our troops in anything but an emergency requires a direct vote by the public. Those who vote YES, are immediatly made eligeble for a draft, which commences the day after the election. Let those who want to play nanny to he rest of the world do it. Those at home will be able to rest secure in the knowledge that those dying for the rights of people in other coutries are doing so because they want to, not because they joined the military because they wished to defend the US and ended up being used as pawns.",

YOu will find that it is overwhelming force. This is what saddam and the baathists were doing, they were defending against those who, as you so eloquently put it, sought to harm the order of society. Funny how when you are talking about your own country and government, different standards apply, isn't it?\n \n \n \n \n7. personal action and sacrifices. you assail me for not acting on my belief. have you? if the killing is so egregious what have you done?\n i think you are a coward by suggesting that those who support intervention be drafted, because then that allows those who opposed to remain safe. what a pacifist utopia that would be to make all those who support military actions kill themselves so the meek will inherit the earth? we all do what we can, in the best way we can. if i was drafted i would go without any hesitation. especially if there is a humanitarian stake involved.\n you wouldn't even risk anything to save your neighbor.\n let them come for others as long as they don't come for you.\n\n \n I have done my share of killing, and prefer not to do any more unless it is really needed, and nobody had to draft me to get me there. IF the occasion were to arise where I felt my services were required, I would once again provied them, and nobody would have to draft me to get me there. I am oee h#$l of a long ways from being a coward, and have the commendations to prove it. I doubt you can say the same. \n \n IF one of us was to be classified as a coward, I think it would be the one who advocate sending our military all over the world to interfere with affairs that do not concern us, but only so long as it is others doing the fighting and dying. Is your life so valuable that society as a whole would suffer if you died actualy praticing the ideals you vocalise so freely? OR are you not willing to take the pay cut to liberate all the oppressed people of the world? \n \n At one time I thought like you. I was so conviced that there was some point to it all that after my hitch was up, I moved to the private sector. You know what happened when we stopped the serbs in bosnia? The Albanians started killing the serbs and burying them in mass graves. I was there to shut down the slavemarkets in the DRC. Immediatly, the new folks in charge opened new slave markets where they could market their former oppressors. I was htere when freetown fell, and there when it was liberated. I saw the geurillas, who had engaged in absolutly inuman acts of cruelty, flayed alive in the street after the city was liberated.\n \n I have been there, in the ****, and seen enough of it to know that it is all a bunch of C#$P. I actually stood on top of a hill in west africa and watched American Marines fire on Navy seals because marines had been sent to \"advise\" the rebels and seals had been sent to \"advise\" the government troops. America doesn't care who wins and couldn't care less what happens to the people in the region, as long as we can set up relations with whoever ends up on top and open up their markets to American companies, open their resources to American mining and drilling intrests, and they let us post our troops there so we can work our voodoo on their neiborghing countries. Let them kill whoever they want, and treat their people however they like, as long as they are buying tarif free Coke.\n \n Peacekeeping doesn't work, nor does liberating a country and turnig it over to opposing factions. While stopping the fighting sounds like a good idea, all peacekeeping missions do is ensure that instead of killing 100,000 people in a year and having it over with, you kill 50,000 people per year for 10 years. Liberating a country like Iraq and turnign it over to a democratic govenment is STUPID. \n \n You have three ethinic groups in Iraq that absolutly hate each other. Even when the IRaqi government was horribly mistreating it's people, they hated each other so much that they prefered attacking each other to attacking the government. The only way this idiotic plan for Iraq is going to work is if we pick the group want to deal with and kill off the other two.\n \n Americans cant get their heads around this. We have been lucky, our contry is not divided into a few major factions intent on destroying each other. We can look with distain on foreign leaders who bomb towns in retaliation for attacks, but have no idea what it is like to live in a place where mortar attacks by insurgents are a not uncommon occurance.",

THe British ad french had no real chance of beating hitler to begin with, which is why they waited.

Beyond that, you can google it just as well as I can.\n \n \nas long as we makes artificial distinction while countless die, more will die. when rwanda first started, Clinton claimed it was not genocide, just a political insurrection.\n you make a distinction based on nationality, of us vs them, of the US vs non-US. if we are not our brothers keeper who is? if your family and particular group were systematically persecuted and hunted for extermination, whether it be for political or ethnic reasons, would you want the world to stand by and say it is an american problem?\n\n \n When you are talking about using American troops and Americans tax dollars to do it, I would say that the US/rest f the world is a pretty valid distinction. You could take it a step further and say that it is probably best that we not interfere in other cultures\n \n For years the blacks were sytematically persecuted, and many of them died. YOu will have to remind me, which country was it that invaded and overthrew our government then? Ok, there was no country that did that, because it was an Ameican problem. It works ot better that way. You et the two sides work it out, then you dont have to keep peacekeepers in there forever.\n \n \nis there such a recognition and respect for any particular religion in the US constitution?\n the iraqi do want democracy, but letting them have it isn't enough. democracy has to be built, it just doesn't spontaneously arise from thin air. i do not believe we are forcing it on them. they wanted it before saddam. they wanted it under saddam. they want it now.\n most muslem arabs want it still.\n\n \n The problem is you will always have questions regarding the legitimacy of the Iraqi government because of hte way we did it. By appointing a governing council (some members were expats whowere brought back to Iraq to sit on the council) and commisioning that council to create a constitution and a govrnment, the IRaqi governemtn will always be open to criticism about its origins.\n \n \nif the german army was so good why did it lose?\n truth is studying history note that Hitler gave standing orders to withraw from both Alsace-Lorraine and Czechoslovakia had the Franco-Brittain reacted with threats of force.\n\n \n They lost because they became over extended. They were unable to keep their troops supplied or supported. I have eard before about Hitlers standing order to withdraw, but it does not seem tha anybody can provide any documentation form the period to support this. The closest they can come (and I have seen this presented as evidence for this on several occasion) is a written order to his commanders to fall back and await reinforcement in such a case. \n \n \nactually documents suggested what happened was that saddam raise the issue of his southern border with kuwait with the US. the US response was that we have no interests in his dispute with Kuwait. it was a mistake to believe this was permission to invade Kuwait.\n\n \n You are right, it was a mistake for him to interpet it that way, but it seems he did.\n \n \n \nand with regard to the iran-iraq war, this was not started at the American request, this was just another attempt by saddam to control ME oil ways. please provide proof where saddam waged war for the US. note that if the US supported him afterward in war against iran doesn't mean he waged war on the US behalf. note also that the US sold arms to iran in this war as well, as most of the irannian equipments were american made.\n\n \n THis was a waterways dispute, specifically regarding the shatt waterways, which are IRaqs only access to the persian gulf. I suppose you could say it was an attempt to control mideast oil ways, since Iraqs main export is oil, and they would be unable to export it without access to the gulf. The shatt al arab is also the biggest source of fresh water in souther Iraq. Added tension came from the fact that Iran is (and was) primarily ruled by the shia, and Iraq was primarily ruled by sunni. Iran was rueld, by muslim fundamentalists, Iraq by progressives. There is a pretty decnt explanation of what happed at http://www.american.edu/projects/mandala/TED/ice/IRANIRAQ.HTM\n \n As far as the US selling wqeapons to Iran and supporting Iraq, this is just another example of poor US foreign policy. See my above example about US troops firing on each other.\n \n \nof Hitler and Saddam the same as the government of Lincoln and Roosall governments have a monopoly on the use of force. how that force is applied and the reasons for its application is where judgement and morality enters the equation.\n is the government executing a serial killer the same as the government killing a man for speaking his belief and opposition?\n is the government killing a terrorist plotting to kill hundreds the same as the government killing a woman for the sole reason she is black?\n is the government evelt?\n if you think these are one and the same then i really question your grasp of morality.\n\n \n No, of course not. THe examples I gave were not of the governemtn killing serial killers or terrorists. THey were examples of the government killing people for their beliefs and political stance. It happens in every country, and the degree usually is directly relatd to the percieved threat level.\n \n \nI have spent the majority of my adult life dedicated to saving lives. I have not been 100% successful. In someways it is a losing battle because we all will die. But if you base your action on the chances of success alone then this is wholely insufficient. We do what we can because it is the right thing to do. Courage enters when we continue to do the right thing in the face of criticism and opposition, when the likelihood of success slim to none. the righteousness of an act is not contingent upon success.\n\n \n So you are saying we should base our decisions on knee jerk emotional responses instead of logic? \n \n \nyes things have not always gone as we like. this is because we always and should always want more than what we get, or will be allowed. i'd say this is a good thing as we will then continue to seek to do better. failures of the past should push us to do more, to do better, not to do less and withraw.\n imo the price of inaction will invariably be higher than delayed action.\n\n \n I am not arguing the results, I am argung that the very premise of our actions is beyond flawed, it is just plain STUPID. Trying tp bring people together at the end of a gun is an idiotic idea. History has shown that you loose less people if you just let them fight it out.\n \n \nfinally, i take great exception to your suggestion that those who support war are cowards unless we do the fighting. this is not how a society works. the basic premis of any society is that we all contribute what we can, in our own way, to society. this will differ from person to person, time to time. otherwise there is no point to having any constructive and productive society.\n\n \n YEs, unfortunatly I have noticed that generally folks who heavily advocate such interventionist policies are seldom the same ones who feel their contribuition should be goin out and getting shot at. They generally feel that their contribution should be done stateside. It seems that is how you feel.\n \n \nwhy should i pay more taxes to support those less fortunate?\n\n \n I have no problem with this, as long as we use that money in a way that best assists the poor. Money handouts do nothing but keep the poor the way theya re without providing incintive to improve their lives.\n \n \nwhy should i risk my life when others will do it?\n\n \n I have risked my life. This is your cause, it is your turn\n \n \nsuch an attitude will only divide, not unite.\n i do not believe those who stayed at home while others go to wars are cowards if they contribute in their own way. the fathers and mothers, the spouses and offsprings of those who risks their lives in war are not cowards.\n perhaps it should not be cowardice i accuse you of, but selfishness.\n let me than oppologize for calling you a coward.\n but your selfishness then is appalling.\n\n \n I am not saying that everybody who stays at home are cowards. I am saying that those who strongly support sending troops to other countries on \"humanitarian\" missions because they strongly believe it is the right thing to do are cowards if they do not sign up to be the first off te boat. I will add that this is also selfish. Expecting others to die so you can feel like you are somehow doing something (I guess by paying your taxes?) to help people in the other part of the world is incredibly selfish. \n \n I still think my plan is a god one. Alternatively, we could just allow the armed forces to vote on humanitarian missions. Right now, our foreign policy is being set by selfish cowards who are mroe than willing to see others die in defense of their ideals, but are unwilling to take up a gun and fight for themselves. \n \n I still don't understand why you are not off fighting oppression in all its forms since you seem to believe so strongly in it. I could provide you with pretty long list of countries where people are being oppressed RIGHT NOW, if you would like. I could even gve you a list of PMC's that might be willing to hire you, with the condition that you don;t get paid for the first 2 months (then you get a check for the entire two months) and you get no death benifits (so if you die in the first couple months, they haven't lost anything but the cost of an airline ticket). The closest II have heard to an excuse as to why you are not out there acting as a chapion for your cause is that you don;t feel that \"your part\"\" should involve spending nights sleping in the open with a rifle, getting shot at all day, and watching the guys on either side of you die. I know a couple of guys in the military who are in Iraq right now who feel that shouldn't be \"their part\" either.",

You want military action taken, you will vote for others to go do it, while you sit at home in the aforementioned air conditioning and drive around in the aforementioned SUV.\n \n I ask again, what exactly do you do that is serving society so well? IS it really more important than saving oppressed people halfway aorund the world? Why should my friends, who joined the military to protect this country, have to die fighting for oppressed peopel in other countries because you, and people like you, want to feel like you are doing something good?\n \n We should probably just agree to disagree on this point. You are always going to think I am just heartless, and I am always going to think you are just a pathetic coward who has never seen the stuff they are talking about first hand, so really has no valid viewpoint. I know my mind will not be changed. I have buried to many who fought and died for the beliefs of others. Your viewpoint is also unlikely to change, since you have no frame of reference from which to draw your conclusions beyond percieved morality and sociological principals.\n\n \n emoticon_rolleyes\n all you have claimed is to have served. you could have served in the US. you could have served as a cook. you could have served as a driver. you could not have served at all!\n by your absence of morality and appreciation of teamwork for society i am not surprised you won't changed your mind. that is the problem is that you \"have served\" yet served without ideals, or understood the ideals worth fighting for.\n i have seen the oppressed.\n i have seen the dead.\n i have done what i can, and have given more than i have received.\n i have a greater appreciation of a human life than you do.\n and i believe that we live in a human society separated by artificially paved streets of national borders.\n \n i don't think you heartless, i think you are lost.",

   "I've read a lot of stuff on here criticizing America's handling of the Iraqi people, how we're all responsible for civilian deaths, blah blah blah. If any of you know about what happened...this is disgusting, it really is. How can you complain about the US killing civilians when you see what many of these people are like? It's a good thing I'm not in charge over there, because if I had been, I probably would have bombed this mob while they were mutilating the bodies. I just wanted to know what some of the more liberal people on the forum thought of this. I'm gonna bet right now most of them will blame the US for this.\n\n Lets see, what would have happenned if america abided by international law. Iraq would not have been invaded, and those poor mutilated souls would never have been mutilated.\n \n Or, if those poor mutilated souls, never went to iraq, then they wouldnt have been mutilated, the iraqis didnt go to america to mutilate them, the americans went to iraq, illegaly, amd so they got mutilated.\n \n All this uproar about two americans being mutilated, how about all those poor iraqi women and children that were mutilated by cluster bombs and other such weapons? Maybe you should bomb the mob who fired into innocent women and children.\n \n The U.S isnt to blame for this, the iraqis are, the U.S is blamed for mutilating innocent women and children.",

Again, read kissinger. He gives a great insider view of what was going on during that time period.\n \n \nwhose morality? you can apply that question to any societal issue, whether it be abortion, death penalty, graduated tax, prayer in school. ultimately society debates about it, makes a policy and enact it, and then continue to debate about it to improve/change it.\n btw, read my posts again, i never advocated sending peacekeeper all over the world. in fact i don't think i ever used the term peacekeeper before this post!\n\n \n So, what would you call sodiers that we send all ofver the world to stop people from being oppressed? If you call them \"invading armies\" every time, it is a pretty poor for PR.

After serving n the US military, I worked fro Executive outcomes until they \"shut down\" (thye never really shut down, jsut broke up into a coupel of splinter companies). Difficult to prove personal things on forums, you are right. I generally assume people are telling the truth unless what they say is just blatently out of whack. Personally, I don;t know anybody here, nor do I particularly care what their opinion of me is, so I see no point in lying. Perhapse you do, maybe lying is a habit with you. I don't know, I take what you say at face value until I actually have a reason to believe otherwise.\n \n \nby your absence of morality and appreciation of teamwork for society i am not surprised you won't changed your mind. that is the problem is that you \"have served\" yet served without ideals, or understood the ideals worth fighting for.\n\n \n Nope, at one time I was an idealistic person like you.

I am not ashamed of what I do for a living. I own a small company that specialises in one off production items and prototypes.

Unfortunatly, you are dead wrong. We don't live in one big human socitey, we all live ont he planet earth, which is broken into hundreds of different societies. I can see why you are so misled in your \"nobel\" thinking (which seems to serve to get people killed). You see the world as one big society, which is apparently like the one you live in. Travel some, buddy, go see the rest of the world. Go see Africa, the middle east, spend a couple weeks driving the costal highway in turkey. You will find that the world is not one big society, it is a whole bunch of little ones that sometimes work together and sometimes dont. You cant force them to.

   "I'm not talking about how they were killed that bothers me. What bothers me is the fact that the 4 Americans were civilians and that they were delivering free food to Falluja! The Predator you talked about is different, we were killing people who were trying to kill us, they are enemies with an intent to destroy us. The 4 Americans in Falluja weren't there to kill or harm Iraqis, and they weren't soldiers. Then throw in the fact that we simply shot a missile to kill a group of people, the Iraqis drug the bodies through the streets and hung them from a bridge.\n \n\n \n You are a real joker you know that? It is not hard to read up on the net and learn about things and get informed before opening the wide Ole yonder and make a fool of yourself.\n \n These guys were hired guns for sale to the highest bidder. Armed Mercenaries taking part in war for money. One of them is an escaped convict wanted for being part of a death squad for the murder of opposition political party. Which makes him a TERRORIST.\n \n Handing out free food???? Where do you pull out these stuff from??? Saddam used to hand out free food in the oil for food program to certain Iraqi's. Americans DO NOT now that oil for food program has been discontinued and all the money is given to American companies to take back home. Well at least it looks like that since unemployment is now like 60%.\n \n \n But here is someone else's comment on people like you that fits.\n \n \n A lot of them ask about my nationality, of course -- the basic tribalism that is such a defining feature of Americanness, except on the liberal fringes. Some of them seem to believe that, with my non-European name, there is something terribly shady about the fact that I don't have my nationality at the top of the site in 60-point flashing letters.\n \n Others like to write in to tell me how horrible my \"friends\" the Fallujah mujahideen are. Or, of course, about how I am a Saddam apologist -- tough to do if they just stick to what I've actually said or written as opposed to what they've imagined.\n \n Then there are those who write to tell me all the things I should know about Iraq -- although they have no idea what they're talking about. That's a subject for several posts. I'll get back to it.\n \n But it's interesting that the average American knows so little about these matters and yet has such firm opinions. Here's an extreme example, sent to me by one of my right-wing fans. It's a \"letter from a soldier.\" You can read the whole thing here. But here are some claims putatively made by Ray Reynolds, SFC, of the Iowa National Guard:\n \n \n http://www.empirenotes.org/index.html\n \n \n \n \n \n Report: Mercenaries Second Largest Force in Iraq.. they all deserve whatever the get \n \n http://engforum.pravda.ru/showthread.php3?postid=776932",
