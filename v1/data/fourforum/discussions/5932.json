   "Bush finds no friends at networks\n \"More than two-thirds of the news stories on ABC, NBC and CBS covering the first 100 days of Mr. Bush's second term were negative, according to an analysis released today by the District-based Center for Media and Public Affairs (CMPA). It's actually a slight improvement: During the first 100 days of his initial term in office, the coverage was 71 percent negative, according to a similar CMPA study conducted in 2001. In comparison, President Clinton's first-term news coverage was 59 percent negative in 1993. The three networks also seem to be boycotting Mr. Bush this time around. He rated 619 stories during the study period in 2001-- but just 250 stories this year, the study found. \n \n ABC was the most critical -- 78 percent of the coverage of the president on \"ABC World News Tonight\" was negative. On CBS, the coverage was 71 percent negative. The study called NBC \"more balanced\" at 57 percent negative.\"\n \n http://www.washtimes.com/national/20050710-110047-2712r.htm\n \n It seems that every now and then during a Republican presidency, the press has to be called on the carpet in order to stay fair. Whether it's one network screwing up by using fake sources (60 Minutes on CBS) or this case of a study showing unbalanced coverage, it only shows what many of us have known for a long time--that much of the press leans unobjectively to the left.",

It was so bad then that the Democratic congress lost it's majority, and a president got impeached. Congressmen were resigning (Gingrich for example). And yeah, we're at war, but the point is that we are actually dealing with terrorism, not just in Iraq but in Afganistan as well.

What are you going to do (just curiosity here) if your house devalues 15-20% in the next year and you take a double digit rate increase due to being upside down in you house (bank has to raise your rate in order to make up the risk factor). Since the housing market, financing, construciton, and flow through industries make up nearly 30% of our GDP, what happens when you loose your job due to the hit on economy? It used to be that you were required to put down 20% on a house, and there was a damn good reason for that. That way, you had a cushion in case your home took a downward revaluation.\n \n Looking at history, we know there is no such thing as a localized housing bubble on the scale they are talking. \n \n \n \n \nI don't know where you get your source info on this, but everything except the 1st item doesn't apply with me.

If the Asians stop buyiong our bonds, that would do it....and they have already started moving away from them. If we have to continue to boost interest rates to make our bonds salable, that would do it (and we are already havcing to increase interest rates to keep our bonds salable). If the housing bubble bursts, that would almost CERTAINLY do it, and bubbles do not last forever. \n \n What people who go on about the economy are generally talking abotu is the future, not the present.

Now it seems many must \"keep up with the Joneses\" and have become part of the herd.\n Dono\n\n \n \n I think that depends almost entirely on the Americans public reaction to things, which is why I am not optimistic. Professional speculators are already pulling out all over the country. As interest rates climb, you price potential buyers out of the market.\n \n Traditionally, the slow leak down or plateau has never worked out well. In the Ag crash, 90% of the crash was driven by public panic. Teh ag market was certainly due ofr a correction, but people were estimating 5-8%. 3 weeks into it, land that was selling for $2500 per acre 3 weeks before was literally selling for $50 per acre. In the Japanese bubble burst, same thing. A correction was certianly in order, but the crash was not necessarily pre-ordained. Even the bursting of the .com bubble was much more severe than it really needed to be. It is public percetion that decideds what happens to a bubble anywhere.\n \n This si the problem with building such a bubble. These bubbles are based on (to borrow the title of a well known book) irrational exuberance. They are built on foolish investments by a public that honestly believes that the comoddities in quesiton will never fall. The problem with building a market soley on consumer confidence is that if that confidence falters, your market deflates to its previous level (though typically 20% beklow its previous level is more likely). \n \n When you estimate such a thing, the prime consideration has to be an estimation of the publics ability to deal with a crisis in a evel headed, rational manner. Personally, my experience has been thatt he american public is mostly composed of dumb, panicky, herd animals that do not deal with crisis worth a damn. \n \n Personally, I hope I am wrong. I really do. But I don't think I probably am. We are in for some hard times in the next several years, which is absolutly goign to effect the real estate market (and everything else). I think that the first itme we start to see real estate markets slump, those dumb, panicy, herd animals will stampede for the exit, absolutly destroying the market.",
