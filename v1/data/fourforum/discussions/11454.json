   "Right, I need a gun expert's input here. \n \n It's about the effectiveness and practical usefulness of body armor, specifically the class III and IV body armors. \n \n Are they really as effective against rifles as they are supposed to be? I'm in an argument on another forum, and we'd appreciate input regarding how much protection they really offer.\n \n Also, are they practical yet, IE, possible to carry for longer periods of time. I know you could theoretically just layer up kevlar until it could withstand a depleted uranium penetrator, but last I read up on the subject, the III and IV class were subject to controversy (they were supposed to only protect at some range and not be wearable for protracted periods of time).",

The majority of police officers only encounter suspects armed with handguns, so there's little call to equip them with 30 or 40 pound vests for patrol.",

It is difficult to actually wear level III vests for more than a couple hours, and it definately decreases your agility. \n \n And guidlines stating what a vest will stop are very specific. They are determined not only by caliber, but powder load, structure and composition of the bullet, and velocity. A variation in any of these factors may not guarantee protection.",
