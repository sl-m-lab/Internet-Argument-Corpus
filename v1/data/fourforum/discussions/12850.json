How many guns does a person have to own before they are considered to have a \"stock pile?\" How do you propose the manufacturers and distributors take responsibility? What would you have them do differently? What specifically do you object to regarding gun manufacturers and distributors? What loop holes are you referring to?

If they are willing to murder somebody, what makes you think they are going to have a problem obtaining a gun illegally?\n \n \nAlso, many people who keep guns for self-defense purposes (as you mentioned above) end up having their own guns used against them.

I find it very difficult to believe that common criminals are such expert hand to hand combat masters that they are able to disarm and kill an armed person before they are shot in more cases than not.

   "The law tells us tht the thought can precede the act by seconds in order to establish premeditation. That's the difference between murder and manslaughter.\n\n From Crime Statistics Murder Vs Manslaughter :\n \nA murder is committed when an individual kills another with &#8220;malice aforethought&#8221;. Malice aforethought can be defined as&#8220;intent to kill&#8221; or cause body injuries either expressed or implied. If an individual has an intention to kill and uses a deadly weapon to do so, it will necessarily be implied by the court.\n \n Manslaughter can be categorized into two important parts: voluntary manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter. When a person kills another person intentionally, but only after &#8220;adequate provocation&#8221;, he is guilty of voluntary manslaughter. Adequate provocation means a person kills another by losing self control and in the heat of passion. Involuntary manslaughter occurs when there is no intention to cause injury or death during a commission of other crime or when someone is killed due to criminal negligence. \n\n The difference is in that heat of passion / loss of self control. Once enough time has passed (ex. the time it takes to build a bomb), then it is very hard to argue heat of passion / loss of self control. So, if you kill after a sufficiently long delay, then it would be far more likely to be categorized as murder, as opposed to manslaughter. That is my main point. One does not generally build a bomb in the \"heat of passion\". It takes self control to design and build a bomb - self control that shows premeditation. In contrast, one can easily kill with a gun while in that \"heat of passion\".\n \nSo then are we to presume that you believe that every murderer is insane and therefore immune from prosecution?\n\n When I say that someone who would commit murder is \"not in their right mind\", I do not mean insane. I mean not calm and rational. Ultimately, we may mostly be just talking about a matter of degree - where, in the heat of anger, most of us are not calm and rational either but let our emotions at least partly overcome our rationality. Those who are unstable let that happen to a much higher degree than the rest of us. Those who are insane are an extreme example.",
