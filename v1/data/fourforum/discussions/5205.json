   "Looking at these pictures, something suddenly struck me: we humans appear to be a neotenous species, for the more human skulls look far more \"baby-like\" than the chimp and Australopithecus skulls. Does anyone know if this is recognised by the biological community as being the case, or am I just letting my imagination get the better of me?\n\n \n Yes, it is widely accepted and, although it has gained additional support and interest fairly recently, the idea goes back to the very early 1900s.\n \n \n\"Humans as Neotenic Animals\n One of the first scientists to conceptualize the potential evolutionary importance of heterochrony - of the effect of differential rates of reproductive and physical development - was the Dutch embryologist and developmental anatomist Louis L. Bolk. Although his basic, descriptive embryological studies and publications were well known and very respected through the latter decades of the nineteenth and into the early twentieth century, Bolk did not publish the first of his few but influential treatises on the subject of the interplay between development rates until 1915. His grand synthesis and overview appeared in print in 1926, just four years before his death at the age of sixty-four. Building on the suggestions of the early-nineteenth-century French naturalists and comparative anatomists Georges-Louis de Buffon and Etienne Geoffroy Saint-Hillaire, who had long before recognized the extreme similarities in skull shape between adult humans and juvenile apes, partuclarly orangutans, Bolk was determined to demonstrate the existence of such similarites in all aspects of adult human and juvenile ape anatomy.\n \n For example, one of Bolk's favorite examples had to do with the angle between the plane of the base of the skull, through which the spinal cord passes, and the plane of the face. As is typical of mammals in general, in human and ape fetuses the angle between the base of the skull and the face is essentially ninety degrees, a right angle. This is a pretty tight angle, which Bolk described as producing an extreme flexure between the facial skeleton and the base of the skull. In addition, because the base of the skull faces down relative to the face, the fetus's head sits atop the vertebral column and the facial skeleton lies at a right angle to it.\n \n In apes,as in most other mammals, the angle between the skull base and the facial skeleton opens up and the spatial relationship of these regions changes. With growth, the base of the skull rotates away from the enlarging snout, with the result that the hole through which the spinal cord exits the skull - the foramen magnum - and the two points of articulation on the skull base for the first vertebra - the occipital chondyles - point backward to varying degrees. But in humans the severe angle between the face and the base of the skull does not change with physical growth. As in the fetus, the adult human's foramen magnum and its associated occipital chondyles continue to lie centrally on the base of the skull. In turn, this means both that the adult skull continues to sit right on top of the vertical vertebral column and that the face continues to lie at a right angle to the vertebral column. Of special note, of course, is that the orientation of the vertebral column in humans is associated with their bipedal form of locomotion. As Bolk envisioned it, an adult human is essentially an upright-walking embryo. And if this reflects a prolongation of juvenile growth rates into adulthood, then humans are indeed neotenic.\n (Sudden Origins: Fossils, Genes, and the Emergence of Species, Jeffrey H. Schwartz, John Wiley & Sons, 1999, p134-135)\n \n\n \n And even the fact that humans have much larger brains than other primates is explained by neoteny.\n \n \n\"If there is one important developmental trait that distinguishes humans from the rest of the animal kingdom, it is our retention of the fetal neural growth rate. Like human brains, apes' brains have a high growth rate before birth. After birth, however, this rate slows greatly in the apes; in contrast, humans have rapid brain growth for about two years. During early postnatal development, we add approximately 250,000 neurons per minute. The ratio of brain weight to body weight at birth is also similar for great apes and humans. By the time humans are adults, however, the ratio for humans is literally \"off the chart\" at 3.5 that of apes.\n \n At the cellular level, we find that no fewer than 30,000 synapses per second per square centimeter of cortex are formed during the first few years of life. ...\n \n The prodigious rate of continued neuron production has important consequences. Portmann, Gould, and Montagu have each made the claim that we are essentially extrauterine fetuses for the first year of life. Our actual gestation period is 21 months if you follow the charts of ape maturity. In other words, humans are at 21 months what other apes are at birth. Our \"premature birth\" is an evolutionary compromise between maternal pelvic width and the infant's head circumference and lung maturity. The mechanism for the retention of the fetal neural growth rate has been called hypermorphosis - the phyletic extension of development beyond its ancestral state.\n (Developmental Biology: Seventh Edition, Scott F. Gilbert, Sinaur Associates Inc., 2003, p408)\n \n",
