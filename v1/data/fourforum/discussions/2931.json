   "Social science research strongly supports the common-sense observation that children do best when raised by their married mother and father. Twelve family scholars surveyed thousands of studies and reached the conclusion that \"Marriage [traditional marriage] is an important social good associated with an impressively broad array of positive outcomes for children and adults alike.\" Children raised by their married parents are less likely to experience child poverty, commit suicide, commit crimes, suffer physical or sexual child abuse, or to divorce later in life. \n So when Rosie O'Donnell's then six-year-old son told her, \"I want to have a daddy,\" he was pleading not just for what he wants, but for what he needs. Rosie's response, shared on ABC, is to tell her son, \"If you were to have a daddy you wouldn't have me as a mommy because I'm the kind of mommy who wants another mommy.\" So much for putting children first.\n Three decades into America's epidemic of fatherlessness, we know that depriving children of fathers damages them and their future. Same-sex marriage will rob children of what they need most: the love and nurture of both a mother and a father.",

They learn compassion at a higher rate, they are more well adjusted to social change and are usually high achievers scholastically. \n \n I think you are refering to children of broken homes and single parents. Not gay families at all. \n \n Trust me, my son is my biological child. Not the product of outside sperm donation. \n I was the VICTIM of social pressures which told me that my NATURAL orientation towards those of my same gender was in some way not \"normal.\" I believed that if I entered into a heterosexual relationship it would somehow \"cure\" me of my NORMAL AND NATURAL feelings.\n Although, my orientation had NOTHING to do with the demise of my marriage. Insted it fell apart because of INFIDELITY on my husband's part! \n And that was no fault of mine, that boy just couldn't keep it in his pants. He went through two other marriages after mine. I was his second wife. So, don't even think my sexual orientation had anything to do with my marriage not working.\n See, this is exactly what I have been talking about. Infidelity in HETEROSEXUAL relationships, and divorce. \n Those are the two biggest contributors to the \"moral decline of society.\" \n Always has been and I'm sure it always will be. It still doesn't make it right or good.\n \n I was a single parent for nearly six years after my divorce. I went through HELL learning to accept what I ALWAYS knew was the truth. \n Six years, so trust me, I was WELL over my ex-husband by then. \n When I finally did find myself in a life partnership it was one that fit my sexual orientation, made me happy and in turn made my son happy and feel secure. \n He knows he is loved, cared for and is the focus of endless amounts of concern. He does well in school, plays on two sports teams (football and basketball, traditionally EXTREMELY heterosexually driven clubs), play TWELVE Musical instruments and is involved in his youth group in church. He is a good child. Well behaved and well adjusted. \n He views my partner as another step-parent. He also conciders himself among the luckiest of kids because he has FOUR Parents, four sets of grandparents (for those keeping track, that makes eight more on top of the four parents) and thirteen aunts and uncles! \n I dare you to tell me he doesn't have same gender role models! \n A lot more than I can say for many kids of heterosexual parents. Even in divorce cases. Many ex-spouces are excluded from involvement in their child's upbringing whether it be by their doing or the custodial parents. \n \n I'm convinced you've been reading stats from either a GOP funded religious group or are misinterpreting stats from the APA and APC, which are completely the opposite from what you have posted.",

   "The scientific community is diverse - it doesn't consist only of athiests, and athiests are not the only sources of proof. So much of what they \"prove\" is subject to change next week, if a new discovery is made.\n\n \n If you say so, but there isn't any credible evidence that contricits what I said, and what proves Rush to be a liar. Is rush a scientists? :p \n \n \nI don't have a way to prove to YOU that liberal professors are lying.\n\n \n You don't have a way of proving anything you say. You haven't done so, and nor do I expect you to start proving anything you say \n \n \nIf Don Lindsay or one of his comrades aren't saying it, you won't believe it. But the DISCRIMINATION by administration in most universities, against conservative or Christian speakers, or other information that allows students to see both sides is crystal clear. You can't disprove that.\n\n \n Have you ever considered discrimination because they are blatantly wrong, or perhaps for non-political reasons? You make like liberal professors have a free run at colleges and conservative ones don't. Very unrealistic, as well as your lack of hiring procedure knowledge. Face it, you can't prove anything you say. \n \n \nSo you're saying that Christian/conservative students should go outside of the US to get their education and get away from discriminating universities, while athiests should continue to prosper in a country with a foundation that they dispise??\n\n \n Who said atheists dispese america? Many well known atheists love this country, and are trying to prevent the religious from suppressing every civil right they can. Oh wait, civil rights are bad aren't they marc? You can't prove anything you say. It is your choice where you go. No one is forcing you. It is quite hypocritical of you to support a self reponsiblity party but then take a stance like that, but then again, no one ever said the republican party was conistant. \n \n \nA foundation built by 55 men, 52 of which believed in a higher power? With a Declaration of Independence that refers to \"natures God\" and has the words \"endowed by their Creator\"? Do you scoff at our country's foundation the same way you scoff at the Bible??\n\n \n And many of these men supported activities we are appalled to, which you conviently ignored. The declaration of indepdence has no legal holding. Besides, its purpose was to outline a reason of why a rebellion was necessary in the face of Crown oppression. Read it for a change before resorting to a fallacy of laziness that you are so obssessed with. \n \n \nI see you're still refering to Lindsay's logical fallacies list. I thought maybe you'd silently figured out that wasn't a good idea for you - that it's completely moot, but evidently not.\n\n \n Why? Because I have pointed out that you misinterpret them, make up new definitions and refuse to acknowledge the many you commit yourself? emoticon_xbye \n \n \nhen I called you on the \"needling\" part that you routinely violate, you simply changed it to another (stronger) word, \"taunt\", and then explained how you choose to exempt yourself from it.\n\n \n I already explanined the difference. You can't refute it. Face it, you can't prove a single thing you say. \n \n \nYou're REALLY \"poisoning the wells\" when you discredit the Bible.\n\n \n Prove it, oh, wait you can't. You and proof are deathly allergic to each other.\n \n marc9000, put up or shup up. I'm beginning you're a troll.",
