I was more wondering if their was something in US history that made this sort of reverence more likely. Is it simply that the first americans were biblical literalists and this attitude, if not the particular target, has pervaded american culture?",

The text of the 1st and 2nd ammendments to the US constitution get fought over in much the same way as biblical passages. Just a thought...\n\n \n It's an interesting question, but I really don't think there is a link. While one can make the argument that the Bible can have allegorical and symbolic interpretation over and above a literal reading, one cannot, in any court of law do the same with the constitution. There's nothing symbolic about it. \n \n The Biblical interpretive issue is mostly literalism versus symbolism, while with the constitution, everyone pretty much agrees that it has to be taken literally. The fight comes over what is literally being said. For example, you can interpret the 2nd amendment as being about militias or the general populace, but it's pretty obvious the writers didn't mean the right to bear arms as being some figurative statement, as say, the first 6 days of creation in the Bible. IMO, these two documents are mostly incompatible for comparison.",

   "I was more thinking the regard in which the constitution is held. Over here the government wants to do away with juries in serious fraud cases, for example, and most people don't bat an eyelid. Similarly when the government wants to lock people up for 3 months without trial. In the US both constitution and bible are held to be sacrosanct. It doesn't seem to cross the mind of the average american to suggest that the constitution might be wrong to say that everyone has a right to keep and bear arms, similarly many americans don't seem to question the legitimacy of the bible as a source of guidance. There are good and bad sides to this reverance, it seems to me.",
