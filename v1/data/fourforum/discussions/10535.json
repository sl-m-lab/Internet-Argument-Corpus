Most of the SIVs that are a big deal lately seem to be pretty much just a good old fashioned securitization SPE. The big difference I can see is that under the old off book SPE model, the originator had to structure the transaction so they retained no effective control over the off balance sheet assets. With SIVs, it seems like the originator/sponser is actually underwriting the SIV fund. So, they did away with SPE securitization schemes because in truth it was just a giant scam, and it has been replaced with SIVs, which are almost exactly the same, only the originators underwrite the fund, which means they are closely tied to it, but they are doing it all off balance sheet.....\n \n I just don't see how they get away with it, unless FASB has just not quite gotten around to updating their definitions. \n \n As a side note...SIVs are a scame anyway, no matter what you call them and frankly the fact that the SEC has been letting securitization SPEs operate in one form or the other for so many years jsut shows how broken the system is.

I can almost hear that in Paulsons voice.....\n \n Personally I would contend that any market that relies entirely on people making investments and buying securities based entirely on TRUST, without even knowing what they are buying, is destined for failure anyway. \n \n I started looking into SIVs because a friend of mine, and executive level insider at Citbank, is down for a few days to do a little hunting and he let slip that NetBank did not fail just because they were holding sub prime paper, they failed because of their SIVs. He also said that Citibank MIGHT be in as bad or worse a position, they just have more cash, so they can cover a little longer. \n \n I asked him how in the hell an FDIC institution managed to get themselves in that kind of fix, and he said that the SIV's are all \"off balance sheet\" stuff, and the FDIC has ho idea what is going on in that quarter.

I was just a little surprised because I thought that they killed the \"bury all the bad assets under a sham shell\" plan when they brought SPEs in line.\n \n That got me thinking about how far this thing goes. I mean, whose balance sheet to these assets show up on...or do they show up on anybodies, since a private trust can still keep their books out of the public eye, so the earnings are basically \"free money\" on the books, but all the risk and losses are hidden from investors and the public eye. \n \n Talk about screwing your investors.

You have mortgages packaged as securities that were then cut into tranches that were based on order of repayment, not underlying loan quality, so you have paper labeled \"prime\" that is full of sub prime trash mortgages. Then banks take this, stick it in an SIV, underwrite it, and sell blind short term securities, claiming that there is high quality debt backing them, even though it is TRASH, but they sell the short term paper as investment grade based on the theory that since it is short term, the underlying securities PROBABLY won't crash and burn during the holding period.\n \n If you put only one bullet in a revolver, spin the cylinder, and pull the trigger, you PROBABLY won't blow the top of your head off....Russian Roulete is still not a popular game with investors. \n \n No wonder they can't move the paper.
