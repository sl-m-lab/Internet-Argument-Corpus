Yet when the event supposedly ocurred, all the Apostles could do is walk around with their mouths agape.\n \n Also remember these twelve were eyewitnesses to all Jesus' miracles, including the Lazarus affair, bringing the lucky stiff back to life.

The so-called \"Muratorian Canon\" is a list of books probably made at the end of the 2nd century in Rome by an anonymous Christian author, who apparently considered them to be scriptural.\n \n 2.

He accepts the Apocalypse of Peter and the Wisdom of Solomon, as part of the canon, and rejects other books, including The Shephard of Hermans because he believed it was not written in apostolic times.\n \n B. Throughout the period, different Christians argued for the canonicity of a variety of books, based largely on four critieria. ...\n \n C. To the surprise of many people today, the first Christian of record to maintain that the New Testament was to consist of the 27 books accepted today was the Alexandrian bishop Athanasius in A.D. 367 - some 300 years after most of these books had been written!\"\n \n (Course book outline accompanying the video lecture series, \"The History of the Bible: The Making of the New Testament Canon\", by Professor Bart D Ehrman, p49-50) \n",

   "Jerusalem Burial Cave Reveals:\n Names, Testimonies of First Christians\n \n The first century catacomb, uncovered by archaeologist P. Bagatti on the Mount of Olives, contains inscriptions clearly indicating its use, \"by the very first Christians in Jerusalem.\"\n \n An inscription, found on a first century coffin bearing the sign of the cross, reads: \"Shimon Bar Yonah\" = \"Simon [Peter] son of Jonah\". \n \n The catacombs were found and excavated primarily by two well-known archaeologists, but their findings were later read and verified by other scholars such as Yigael Yadin, J. T. Milik and J. Finegan. Both archaeologists found evidence clearly dating the two catacombs to the first century AD, with the later finding coins minted by Governor Varius Gratus at the turn of the millenium (up to 15/16 AD). Evidence in both catacombs indicated their use for burial until the middle part of the first century AD, several years before the New Testament was written. \n \n As Claremont-Ganneau further investigated the tomb, he found inscriptions, including the names of \"Eleazar\"(=\"Lazarus\"), \"Martha\" and \"Mary\" on three different coffins. \n \n Bagatti also found evidence which clearly indicated that the tomb was in use in the early part of the first century AD. Inside, the sign of the cross was found on numerous first-century coffins. \n He found dozens of inscribed ossuaries, which included the names Jairus, Jonathan, Joseph, Judah, Matthias, Menahem, Salome, Simon, and Zechariah. In addition, he found one ossuary with crosses and the unusual name \"Shappira\" - which is a unique name not found in any other first-century writtings except for the Book of Acts (5:1). \n \n Photographs in the link below\n \n http://www.leaderu.com/theology/burialcave.html\n \n Ossuaries Bear Witness to Jesus\n \n Need something etched in stone confirming Jesus before 70 A.D.? \n \n \"This catacomb on the Mount of Olives belonged apparently to one of the earliest families which joined the new religion of Christianity. In this group of sarcophagi, some of which have the Christian symbol and some have not, we are, so to speak, [witnessing the] actual unfolding of Christianity. Personally, I think that many of the Hebrew-speaking people whose remains are contained in these ossuaries were among the first followers of Christ.... The appearance of Christianity at the very gates of Jerusalem is, in my opinion, extraordinary and unprecedented. Somehow the new [Christian] doctrine must have made its way into the Jewish system.... The association of the sign of the cross with (the name of Jesus) written in Hebrew alone constitutes a valuable fact.\" \n \n \"What gives additional value to these short inscriptions is that they furnish a whole series of names found in the Gospels, in their popular and local Syro-Chaldaic forms. The presence of the names of Jesus and Martha, of which we only knew historically that it was the feminine form of the Aramaic, would alone be sufficient to make this collection important from an exegetic point of view. By a singular coincidence, which from the first struck me forcibly, these inscriptions, found close to the Bethany road, and very near the site of the village, contain nearly all the names of the personages in the Gospel scenes which belonged to the place: Eleazar (Lazarus), Simon, Martha ... a host of other coincidences occur at the sight of all these most evangelical names.\" \n \n Italian scholar P. Bagatti discovered another catacomb holding 100 ossuaries on the western side of the Mount of Olives. Coins that were minted by Governor Varius Gratus (A.D. 16) showed that these tombs were used for burial of Christians before A.D. 70. The name of Jesus was found on ossuaries of priests found in the catacomb, indicating they were probably followers of Jesus. Many of the ossuaries included other names, such as Jarius, Jonathan, Joseph, Judah, Matthias, Menahem, Salome, Simon, and Zechariah. \n \n The name of Jesus was found on ossuaries of priests found in the catacomb, indicating they were probably followers of Jesus.

They were not included in Marcion's list of Paul's letters (ca. 140 c.e.), nor do they appear in the earliest manuscript collection of Paul's letters (P46, ca. 200 c.e.). Quotations first appear in Irenaeus's Against Heretics (180 c.e.), and their content fits nicely into the situtation and thought of the church in the mid-second century. Their attribution to Paul is clearly fictional, for their language, style, and thought are thoroughly un-Pauline, and the \"personal\" references to particular occasions in the lives of Timothy, Titus, and Paul do not fit with reconstructions of that history taken from the authentic letters of Paul. The mention of Crete in Titus (Titus 1:5, 12-13), of Ephesus in 1 Timothy (1 Tim. 1:3), and clues from the later legends of Paul, make an Aegean provenance likely (MacDonald 1983).\n (Who Wrote the New Testament?, Burton L Mack, HarperCollins, 1995, p206)\n\n \n And this author is likewise not any kind of a \"Biblically ignorant atheist\".
