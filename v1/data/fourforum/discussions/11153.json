   "Consider the following thought experiment:\n \n Let us imagine that the natural history of Earth was entirely consistent with scripture, confirming it in every detail. In the ground we find no remains of creatures other than the ones around us today, and certainly no remains turned to stone by the passage of aeons. When carbon dated, nothing yields an unbiblical age, and longer-term radiometric dating invariably returns results so close to zero as to be meaningless. Genetically, no two kinds appear closely related, and there is no discernable pattern to the relationships that do exist: dogs and cats are genetically similar in some respects, but cats are equally similar to squid in others - exactly as if a creator had constructed them out of a toolbox of common parts, intelligently exploiting commonality of form or function wherever it arose. Furthermore, though mutations can and do occur, the genome of the every species is highly homogenous, there having been insufficient elapsed generations for any significant variety of mutations to accumulate since Eden's fall.\n \n Evidence of a catastrophic global flood is everywhere: such fossils as do remain are almost all crushed beneath a single worldwide sedimentary layer. No meteor-strikes of any significance mar the Earth's surface. And there are no pyramids or other large, ancient monuments, the global population in the past having been insufficient to permit their construction.\n \n This is not the only possible Earth consistent with scripture by any means, but it's a really, really good one. So let's assume for the moment it's the one we live on.\n \n Now, from this unequivocally biblical Earth a spaceship is launched and voyages far across the galaxy to the life-bearing planet Zod. With no scriptures to guide their understanding of what they find there, the scientists and astronauts must apply the same naturalistic sciences that confirmed Creation so resoundingly back on their home world. They begin by asking: when did god create Zod?\n \n To their considerable consternation, the radiometric dating methods they applied on Earth here yield fantastic ages, a hundred thousand times greater than expected. The strata they unzod pours forth more surprises: a hierarchy of fossil forms rendered into stone by processes that make glaciers look spritely, leading all the way back via simpler and simpler forms to the smeared remains of microscopic buds of life buried unimaginable ages ago. And when they examine the forms and genes of living creatures, they find this nested hierarchy of relationships mirrored there, in both functional DNA and the accumulated detritus of millenia of mutations and random viral insertions. Zogs and Zats share much in common, while Zquid are profoundly different. And unlike the matching perfect design of the shared components of earthly creatures, Zodian life is littered with stupid mistakes and lashed-together solutions. It never even occurs to the scientists that a global flood could have happened - that's a story specific to Earth. Besides, they know what the aftermath of such a flood looks like, and it certainly didn't happen here on Zod.\n \n A nested hierarchy of forms, a hierarchy of fossils, evidence of deep time - the bewildered scientists can see no echo of their familiar, biblical earth. They know what creation looks like, they know what a young planet looks like; this ancient, careworn hunk of rock and the makeshift creatures inhabiting it clearly have a very different history. As they watch in amazement, they see existing zpecies divide, split, migrate, change, adapt - could this be the mechanism of that history at work? The clincher comes when they examine the embryos of Zodian lifeforms and see ancestral features part-form and then redissolve, explicitly showing how accumulated amendments and revisions in the developmental process have shaped and reshaped organisms down the ages.\n \n The scientists shake their heads in wonder. Clearly god moves in mysterious ways, for upon Zod he has seeded life that has dragged itself from the simplest to the most complex of forms across a vast desert of time. They turn to one another and say ruefully:\n \n \"They're never going to believe this back home.\"\n \n '.^-._.-=I=-._.-^.'\n \n My challenge is as follows:\n \n Resolved: Scientists investigating the hypothetical planet Zod would be justified in inferring an evolutionary natural history of life over the special creation with which they are familiar back on Earth.\n \n I will argue the affirmative. As this is a thought experiment, both my opponent and myself will support our positions by referencing genuine scientific evidence as if it had been recovered from Zod, rather than here on Earth. \n \n Furthermore, as the accuracy of scripture is not being called into question in this thought-experiment (science is presumed to have fully vindicated the scriptural history of Earth), I cannot present any evidence necessitating the assumption (or conclusion) that god does not exist or is unable to act upon the universe.\n \n Likewise, because no scriptures speak to the history of Zod, neither scripture itself nor evidence interpreted according to a presupposition of scriptural applicability will be admissable.\n \n The usual debate format will apply, with the caveat that weekdays only be counted for the purposes of response time limits. I am happy to concede to my opponent any advantage this brings him/her.",
