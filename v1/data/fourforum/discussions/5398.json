   "It sticks to my mind for we continue to strongly rely on Shiites in establishing democracy in Iraq. Some pundits believe that creating of Shiite state on the Iraqi soil is huge error by C, Rice. Shiite Iraq combined with Shiite Iran is really a challenge. Some experts argue that Iraqi Shiites terrorized by Saddam's evil regime is thankful to us for liberation. I side with those pundits thinking they will never forgive America the tragic experience of the year 1991, when Shiite community rose to crush Saddam but was abandoned by us. In a word they still have it with us. At least that's a strong possibility. If it's really true then we should stay vigilant with the guys. I guess we are. New Bush's strategic posture with accent on planting stationary military bases in newly born democracies proves the fact. I've got only one question relating to it. Are we for long in Iraq? Frankly, I'd hate to think so. The loss of American life has been so huge in Iraq. Btw our service members died in Shiite attacks too. Our European allies seem reluctant to offer their help. Why? Why should they get economic benefits in Iraq while keeping their soldiers in safety of Europe? They must do their part of democratization job.",

   "How about neither.\n \n While no doubt most are glad/thankfull that Saddam is gone, from what I read many would like the US military to leave Iraq. The current party with the most power in the Iraqi government ran on such a policy that the US should leave as quickly as possible. The news that 4 major bases are being built in Iraq is not going to make many of them very happy.\n \n It seems the one thing Arabic/ Muslim people in general have in common is a dislike for foreign military troops in their land.",
