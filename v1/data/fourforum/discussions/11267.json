   "The fact that it took an APPEALS court to overrule the lower courts flawed ruling is disturbing.\n \n While I'm sure there are a few people who are going to see the word \"gay\" and lose their minds, unable to understand the fundamentals of what is REALLY going on here, it's really quite simple.\n \n They went to the state and formalized their relationship to the degree allowed by the state.\n They brought the little girl into the world together.\n The couple decided to split.\n The SAME STATE dissolved their union, ruling on custody rights.\n \n And then one of the women decides she wants it to be over, moves to another state, and insists that the OTHER state rule on the matter????\n \n If Fred and Diane got married in Texas. They divorce in Texas.\n Diane didn't like the child custody conclusion, so seeks a different ruling in Oklahoma.\n Isn't that obviously wrong?\n \n What is really \"tangled\" here is that the one mother is trying to circumvent existing systems, and the other state refused to recognize a legitimate ruling on the matter by the other state.\n \n One statement of the article GLARES a reality out about this that shouldn't be ignored...\n In 2006, a Virginia appeals court reversed the trial court&#8217;s decision, ruling that a 1980 federal law, the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act, required Virginia to defer to the Vermont courts. \n Could you imagine the chaos a ruling ignoring the Vermont court would have?\n Taking it to the next level, if Diane's kid Jimmy goes to visit her in Oklahoma, and Oklahoma decides to ignore the Texas divorce court ruling, Diane could effectively KIDNAP her kid from the father....\n \n Great \"Family Values\" we got going on here, eh?\n But some people lose their minds when \"gays\" are involved, so they ignore the bigger picture.\n \n This is an issue of one state, Virginia, impinging upon the sovreignty of another state, Vermont.\n Thankfully the appeals court got it right. emoticon_xgood",

   "Ohioprof, I've still got to get to some of the posts in the other thread. If you would stop posting new things that pique my interest, I might be able to get to them :).\n \n \nThe wider implications of this ruling are not entirely clear. But it's a good ruling, a step toward having same-sex unions, parental rights, and children's rights affirmed by the states.\n\n After having read through the ruling, I can say with certainty there will be no wider legal implications to this ruling. It seems to me a very well reasoned opinion, which I will try my best to explain. Personally I think it's important to know what the case was about (including what the court actually said) before praising or criticizing it.\n \n There are two cases interwoven together, and so I hope the distinction between \"biological parent\" and \"other parent\" is clear.\n \n The layperson might accurately say that this particular case was won on a technicality. The court decided the case on what's known in Virginia jurisprudence as the \"law of the case\" doctrine. Essentially, the court held that this exact case had already come before it when the biological parent sought to overturn an appeals court ruling which held that Vermont had jurisdiction over the issue of custody, and therefore Virginia had to recognize the ruling by the Vermont court. This was appealed to the Virginia Supreme Court previously by the petitioner, and that appeal was dismissed because it was not timely filed. Thus, the Virginia Supreme Court did not reach the merits of the claims; they merely dismissed the case because it was not properly filed. The effect of this dismissal is, by default, an affirmation of the Appellate Court. To be clear, it is not an affirmation that they decided the case correctly.\n \n There was another action filed by the other parent to have the custody order issued by Vermont registered in Virginia. The other parent ultimately won this case, and that was appealed to the Virginia Supreme Court by the biological parent. This is what led to the decision highlighted by Ohioprof.\n \n The Virginia Supreme Court declined to reach the merits of the biological parent's claims due to the \"law of the case\" doctrine that exists in Virginia. The \"law of the case\" doctrine holds:\n \n\n [when] there have been two appeals in the same case, between the same parties, and the facts are the same, nothing decided on the first appeal can be re-examined on a second appeal. Right or wrong, it is binding on both the trial court and the appellate court, and is not subject to re-examination by either. For the purpose of that case, though only for that case, the decision on the first appeal is the law.\n\n So, since the biological parent had already exhaustively appealed the same case involving the same parties with the same facts, the court was bound by that initial decision. Remember, though, that the Virginia Supreme Court's affirmation of the original decision was due to a procedural problem in the biological parent's filing before the court, and was not an actual affirmation of what the Appellate Court had held.\n \n It is important to note this: the Virginia Supreme Court has not reached the merits involved in this case, so the following questions are still wide open according to the court:[*]Did the Court of Appeals err in holding that the PKPA requires Virginia courts to give full faith and credit to Vermont's custody order?[*]Does the DOMA take precendce over, or other wise change, the application of PKPA?[*]Did the Court of Appeals err in holding that the PKPA preempts the Marriage Affirmation Act?[*]Does the PKPA preempt Virginia's Marriage Amendment?[*]Does the Vermont order violate the biological parents' fundamental parental rights?Another interesting thing to note is that under the \"law of the case\" doctrine, courts assume (without actually deciding) that there might be errors in the decision of the court below. Because of this, any case decided by this doctrine is limited (and for good reason) only to the individual case, and cannot serve as precedent in any other case.\n \n There was a concurring opinion by the Chief Justice of the Virginia Supreme Court that affirmed the decision of the case, but called into question whether the Appellate Court's decision was actually right on the merits. But because the Court was barred from actually reaching the merits, those questions still remain.\n \n I hope this is helpful. Maybe no one wants to get into this much of the details, but I happen to find it interesting, and sometimes it helps me understand what happened if I try to explain it myself. As I said, I think this case was well reasoned. It is also very limited in its scope since the result only applies to the particular case.",

   "A while back I remember reading a case about a woman (let's call her Janet) who had entered into a domestic partnership with another woman.\n Janet had been previously married, but got divorced.\n Janet was receiving alimony payments.\n Janet was continuing to receive alimony payments even after she entered into the domestic partnership.\n \n Personally, I don't think Janet should receive those alimony payments while in the other domestic partnership. But if memory serves me correctly, the court involved refused to recognize the \"domestic partnership\", so the alimony payments had to continue.\n \n There are over 1,000 rights, responsibilities, and privileges associated with marriage.\n \n But part of the interesting thing is that there ARE responsibilities...\n Like assumption of debt. If Jack is in the hospital, racks up a huge hospital debt and dies, is the partner Mark financially responsible for those bills?\n Or can he pull some great stuff like move to Virginia, and insist that the state has to ignore any correlation between him and Jack?\n \n One of the things that was mentioned in the article was that the mother in Vermont was paying child support.\n If Vermont had lost custody by another state's ruling, do you think that the Vermont mother should have had to continue paying? Would Virginia's ruling have voided child support, because they refuse to recognize the relationship at all?\n Way to think of the kid!\n \n Marriage isn't all fun and games. It has benefits, but it also has responsibilities. And if Virginia had ruled to ignore Vermont's ruling, that could open up a whole different can of worms...",

   "It strikes me that whatever the long run resolution of the legal issues raised in this case, the only way for same-sex parents to ensure that the rights of children to a relationship with a non-biological parent will be protected in the event of divorce is for non-biological parents to do legal adoptions. If one spouse becomes a biological parent, the other spouse who is a non-biological parent needs, whenever possible under state law or policy, to do a second-parent adoption. This is true for heterosexual parents also where the spouse is a step-parent and the child's second biological parent has either died or has given up parental rights. For example, if a heterosexual couple has a child, and one biological parent dies and the other parent remarries, the new spouse, who is the non-biological parent should do a second-parent adoption. It's similar to a same-sex couple in which one parent may be the biological parent and ther other is the non-biological parent. In both kinds of cases, the protect the long term interests of the child, the non-biological parent should do a second-parent adoption. This is easy in the case of married heterosexual couples, harder usually for same-sex couples because of various state legal barriers. But it's especially important for non-biological parents in same-sex couples, because of the problem of state laws that do not recognize our marital relationships. \n \n I know of no states that will void a legal adoption done in another state. Even Florida, the state that currently does not allow gay people to adopt as individuals, will recognize the rights of children to gay parents who have legally adopted them in other states. I know of no state that will legally sever an adoption performed in another state even if the state has a DOMA law.",

I doubt that they recognize pre-existing adoptions by gay parents simply because of legal principles like comity or full faith and credit. I suspect that the issue of the well-being of children is the state's primary concern. \n \n While Florida and other states recognize adoption as creating a family, they do not necessarily recognize same-sex marriage as creating a family. They take a different position regarding the parent-child bond than they do regarding horizontal bonds between adults. At least that is what I suspect is going on. But I could be wrong about that.",
