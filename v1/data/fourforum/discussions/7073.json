There's also self-defense, although not many people seem to have a great desire to defend themselves.\n \n If there's no legal use for a handgun, then why do all those cops carry them?\n \n \nIf there were no handguns in Canada I would support the ban, but as presumably there are already lots, I don't think the ban's a great idea.\nI tentatively agree with this - since there are already loads of illegal handguns in Canada, banning the legal ones will have no effect.\n \n But I don't understand your support of banning them if there aren't any there. Could you explain this further please? If they weren't any, then why would you bother banning them?\n \n \nNot saying I agree with them, but it would make a cops job eaiser.
