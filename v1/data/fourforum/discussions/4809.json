Some of already given up on banning abortion and just want to obstruct women from having abortions. \n \n\n \n We passed a ban against partial birth abortion...tht is a step for the pro-life. Pro-life has gained ground in the polls. I mean just look at some of the facts. We posted a poll some weeks back that showed pro-life is gaining ground. I think it was www.pollingreport.com/abortion and then go down to the Fox News poll that says \"pro-choice\" or \"pro life\".\n \n \nSince when was abortion selfish?\n\n Abortion is selfish if the women knowing gets it done and it is her choice to do it. Why you ask? Because killing someone for your own gain is selfish. That simple.\n \n \nThen again maybe the right-to-life movement sees slavery as justifed since the \"right to life\" out triumphs all other rights...even the right to be free.\n\n Can you explain to me how you have a right to be free without having a right to life?\n \n \nOr how about not valuing society and the future enough to force them to pay for the economic and societal costs of unwanted births?\n\n \n I will agree to this...I value life over society and the economy. Life is what makes the economy.\n \n \nWhether or not you look at it as trying to punish women, you wish women to have no choice in regards to her pregnancy. You wish to use the law to force women through an intimate and life-changing event because it is what your morals tell you to do. You are making her a slave to your morals.\n\n \n Well, you could say the same thing about the unborn. You are not giving him/her a choice you are punishing the unborn, you wish the unborn no choice in regards to being born. You wish the law to force the unborn into death because of your selfishness. You are making him/her a slave to your own selfisheness.\n \n It is a different perspective to look at it from the unborns point of view. I think the unborn should get a say in whether or not he/she lives...otherwise it is at the mercy or the mother whether it lives or dies...kinda like a slave.\n \n \nIt has no right to live.\n\n It has no right to live huh? Well, if you think it is a human life then it does. Even roe vs wade says this. Our government, by the way, doesn't grant a right to life...it just protects it. Guess who our founders thought granted a right to life.\n \n You then ask why does it override the womens rights. Well who said it did? First off I know no right to ones own body. The women does have a right to life just like the unborn. Even so, does a \"right to ones own body\" trump a right to live? I think a right to life is actually the one basic right that all otherwise come from. Without a right to live what good is a right to your own body, or right to speak, or right to anything?\n \n \nOthers have decided for her that her body can be used in this way. If you cannot see the horror in that,\n Others have not decided. She decided to have sex (in most cases). If she gets pregnant then that was her choice..ignorance is not an excuse to kill by the way....Then you claim the horror in that. Well the same could be said about the unborn. Someone else is makign the choice about whether he/she lives or dies...Can you see the horror in that? What is 9 people decided whether you or I dies on any given day? That would stink and you wouldnt like it. \n \n \nThe reason is that no one has the right to live attached to another without their desire or consent.\n \n\n \n Where does this right come from? I guess a concoined twin can kill the attached person if he/she doesn't desire to be attached.",

To think that when it became legalized it went down is just stupid for lack of better term. The amount went up after it was legalized and peaked in the 80s. It has sense gone down a bit and is leveling off (some suggest because of studies that have come out about abortion and the fact that people that don't support abortion has gone up sense the 80s and early 90s).

I guess it has some potential, but so does a fungus. You just think that because it's the spawn of another human being, it's special. Nope.\n\n \n \n Um, actually the spawn of another human being IS a human being. That's pretty much decided by the vast majority of humans and the spawn is legally protected by most governments laws.\n \n \n What's trying to be semantically debated is that some humans aren't 'human' based on the judgers discerning criteria of what 'human' is.\n \n This is exactly the method of double speak used by people through out history to justify slavery, genocide and a general disenfranchisment of their fellow man.\n Basically, many who use this debate tactic are simply hypocrits.\n \n By use of sentience as the determination of what human is, some animals would fall under this classification, being self aware and all as they are. AI would potentially be 'human' (in the classical science fiction realm). And yet, a severly retarded person who is universally protected by the law, would not be.\n But, for some liberal types, the euthanasia of such individuals is perfectly acceptable. It's why there are debates of the issue of living wills and examples like Terri Schiavo. Even though she had expressed no desire previously to terminate her existance is such a situation, and her continued existance was desired by some and caused no real harm to others, many clammored that she should have been disconnected...simply because she was no longer believed to be 'human'.\n \n Since we are individually free to judge what is 'human' and not by the subjective standards some liberals seek to use, I deem a lot of people to be non-human. Now, all I need do is convince many others of my belief...which is what some seem to think is neccessary to legitimize it. \n \n Subjective reality is soo fun.\n \n Did you know that young children really aren't 'self aware' until 3-4 years of age? So, by reasoning that it's ok to eliminate an unwanted 'parasite' based on it's percieved level of self awareness, we should be able to kill off unwanted 'born' infants too. Oh, sorry, you can't. That's never been accepted.\n And, any parent will be able to tell you that all children are parasitical. An infant commonly still needs a host to live and suckle off of.\n \n \n Also note, many states (US centristic) have laws making it a case of murder if you cause the 'death' of the unborn. Weird...\n kentucky recently had a young mother who was pregnant shot to death in louisville. It's considered a double homicide. Strange...\n Also, a southern indiana woman was 8 months pregnant when her husband killed her and her young infant this past week...triple homicide...I'm baffled....\n California, liberal haven, Scott Peterson, tried for the murder of his wife AND unborn child...\n And, that's just recent news.\n \n \n So, why is it in some situations, the unborn are protected and treated as 'HUMAN' for the sake of murder but, in the narrow confines of abortion, they aren't?\n \n Inconsistant practices.\n \n \n I think the bottom line is some say the unborn is a living human (clinically, it is) others desire some further 'proofs' of humanity from it.\n 10 to 1 says that if you were walking in the woods and found the remains of a child that age, you'd think it was a murdered baby and not simply an aborted 'foetus'.\n \n \n From personal experience, I've found that those who universally support abortion are self centered or have no concept of parenthood...often too young and simply sprouting some party line that they have been convinced of is 'proper' and 'enlightened' that they got from someone else.\n Alluding to an unborn child as being similar to a fungus is asinine. A fungus doesn't go away without treatment. A foetus does after several months.\n Don't want to keep it? Give it up for adoption. The waiting lines are long most of the time.\n Heck, I adopted 3 myself. There are people who want your 'trash'. Oddly, they're even wiling to pay through the nose for it too.\n So, the 'unwanted' arguement doesn't hold a lot of water.\n And not willing to bring a mouth into the world without the resources to tend to it. Selfish and defeatist. Very few people are prepared as they'd like to be to bring another life into the world. The vast majority of humanity is brought into the world without optimal resource allocation to them. Many who support abortion for this reason have an unrealistic ide of what's needed to raise a child. And, it's elitist to think that a child should be raised under their idea of proper child rearing and resource management. It translates into the notion that the poor shouldn't have children. They can't afford it. Or the notion that having a child will make you poor as it parasitically sucks away the resources you need for yourself...entertainment and leisure funds dwindle. You have to work 'harder' or forgo that 'education' (that the majority of humanity really doesn't need or have in the 1st place).\n \n \n And, if anyone wants to debate that legal abortions cause LESS harm than illegal ones, we can go there too.\n \n \n \n I really don't care much for abortion debates.\n \n Both sides aren't really convincing of their agendas.\n Anti-abortionist tend to be religious netters (not always) who blather on stringing their notions of morality with religious issues.\n And Pro-abortionist tend to be hypocrits (well, both sides actually) and pseudo-intellectualist utilitarians who have limited life experiences.\n Sure there are exceptions but, not enough.\n I don't go to the bum on the street corner for advice on business and I don't go to the psycholgist who's currently having her 5th divorce for marriage advice so i'm not going to go to some internet person who's more than likely of limited intelligence and education for an opinion on what constitutes 'human'...that's what the bum's for ;) \n \n I tend to side with Cones analysis of the pro-lifer side. As far as I can tell, it's 'human'. Those who desire to use the sentience issue haven't been able to universally state that sentience is the guiding definition of human as in some of the cases I've posited. Until you can prove to me that the foetus isn't human and do so without some twisted redifintion on what 'human' is, I'd prefer to err on the side of caution.\n \n I understand the notion that we should let the mother 'decide' on such 'personal' issues. But, we simply don't do that consistantly. It's illegal for a mother to kill her nonsentient infant. It's illegal for her to abandon her kids who are parasitical. Privacy rights don't cover the ill treatment of another human. Prove to me it's not a human. The government and your neighbor is all up in your business all the time for every trivial matter.\n \n \n \n @Clive14, what the hell?\n A woman say's \"I'm going to have a baby.

Of course not, as she already has one. Likewise no woman is going to declare \"I'm going to have a fetus\" when she finds out she already has one.\n\n Which, through the net doesn't come out exactly as you thought it did.\n What VOR and others posit is that the fetus in the womb IS a baby. Rather than the precursor material for having one appear in the future.\n \n Thus, some could say another comment often heard is 'I am pregnant with child' also stipulates that the fetus is in fact, a child (or baby) and not a 'potential' one. That's probably what VOR should have said to convey his thoughts so as not to be subject to a grammar lesson.\n \n It's simply fine hair splitting on grammar and usage. I just didn't read that into your simple response to VOR.\n Basically she HAS a fetus currently, she will HAVE a baby in the future is the gist of your initial post? No?\n So, in a literal sense, you were interpreting what VOR was saying as 'I'm going (future tense) to have a baby (out of this fetus in my womb).\n Whereas, in the vulgar sense, VOR was saying 'I have a baby in my womb that will be born soon.'\n \n I so love english. It sux. It had nothing to do with intellectuality and more to do with communication. You failed to properly communicate your meaning to me. But, that's ok. We cleared it up. With remarkably few insults (you pig headed simpleton) for an internet debate site. ;)\n \n \n \n And as to fetus in fetu, is that really a 'spawn' since a definition of spawn is the expellation of progeny? The product of something. I spawn, you spawn and we spawn. \n A fetu in fetus hasn't yet be 'expelled'. Although, if you think of it, it often has (from the 'mother') been since it's inside it's twin. ;) Or, does the twin become some aberrant mother-sibling...yet to expel it's twin (because it can't). And, would it be more akin to a cojoined twin rather than a seperate entity?\n [Igor]We must have more of these things to experiments on master.[/Igor]\n \n \n But, such things are rare. Rarer than a tubule pregnancy. Something that few people are opposed to ending as not only is the chance of it surviving limited but the chance of it harming the mother are great. So, a Hippocratic oathed doctor would not be 'doing no harm' by removing it since we don't have the ability to relocate it or save it.\n \n Most antiabortionist aren't opposed to ending a pregnancy for legitimate medical reasons.",

Even though she had expressed no desire previously to terminate her existance is such a situation, and her continued existance was desired by some and caused no real harm to others, many clammored that she should have been disconnected...simply because she was no longer believed to be 'human'.\n\n \n Your twisting of facts leaves much to be desired. There was no discussion whether or not she was still 'human', the discussion was on the matter of law. Her husband had the legal right to disconnect her. Her parents challenged that right in court. The husband and various others claimed Terry told them she would not want to be kept alive this way. The court accepted this and decided in his favor. The parents appealed... many times. Each time the courts decided in the husbands favor. btw, the husband got no money out of removing her from life-support; in fact he was offered millions to transfer custody over to others. It was a tragedy, but he had the right to do so.\n \n \n\n Since we are individually free to judge what is 'human' and not by the subjective standards some liberals seek to use, I deem a lot of people to be non-human. Now, all I need do is convince many others of my belief...which is what some seem to think is neccessary to legitimize it. \n \n Subjective reality is soo fun.\n\n \n I don't believe you really understand what you are debating about.\n \n \n\n Did you know that young children really aren't 'self aware' until 3-4 years of age? So, by reasoning that it's ok to eliminate an unwanted 'parasite' based on it's percieved level of self awareness, we should be able to kill off unwanted 'born' infants too. Oh, sorry, you can't. That's never been accepted.\n\n \n Evidence? And, yes, it has been accepted before, just not by modern society. Infantcide has been practised in every culture in every time period, and in some cultures it was a valid practise.\n \n \n\n And, any parent will be able to tell you that all children are parasitical. An infant commonly still needs a host to live and suckle off of.\n\n \n The difference being that there are a myriad of options open to the woman if she does not want an infant which do not physically harm it, while there is exactly one option open to her if she does not want a fetus. The situation is not morally comparable because the situations between a fetus in the woman and a born infant are vastly different.\n \n \n\n Also note, many states (US centristic) have laws making it a case of murder if you cause the 'death' of the unborn. Weird...\n kentucky recently had a young mother who was pregnant shot to death in louisville. It's considered a double homicide. Strange...\n Also, a southern indiana woman was 8 months pregnant when her husband killed her and her young infant this past week...triple homicide...I'm baffled....\n California, liberal haven, Scott Peterson, tried for the murder of his wife AND unborn child...\n And, that's just recent news.\n\n \n Your point?\n \n \n\n So, why is it in some situations, the unborn are protected and treated as 'HUMAN' for the sake of murder but, in the narrow confines of abortion, they aren't?\n \n Inconsistant practices.\n\n \n Has anyone challenged these murder laws? They cannot be struck down as inconsistent if no-one challenges them.\n \n \n\n I think the bottom line is some say the unborn is a living human (clinically, it is) others desire some further 'proofs' of humanity from it.\n 10 to 1 says that if you were walking in the woods and found the remains of a child that age, you'd think it was a murdered baby and not simply an aborted 'foetus'.\n\n \n Again, that is not the argument\n \n \n\n From personal experience, I've found that those who universally support abortion are self centered or have no concept of parenthood...often too young and simply sprouting some party line that they have been convinced of is 'proper' and 'enlightened' that they got from someone else.\n\n \n Truly? You must have a small circle of friends. I've found that pro-life people fit this much more.\n \n \n\n Alluding to an unborn child as being similar to a fungus is asinine. A fungus doesn't go away without treatment. A foetus does after several months.\n Don't want to keep it? Give it up for adoption. The waiting lines are long most of the time.\n Heck, I adopted 3 myself. There are people who want your 'trash'. Oddly, they're even wiling to pay through the nose for it too.\n So, the 'unwanted' arguement doesn't hold a lot of water.\n\n \n Again, adoption is a parenting choice, not a pregnancy choice. You cannot give a fetus in the womb up for adoption (in the sense of actually giving it).\n \n Your argument of \"just wait several months\" is just bad. That is the point, that women should not be forced, by law, to remain pregnant against their will and without their consent.\n \n \n\n And not willing to bring a mouth into the world without the resources to tend to it. Selfish and defeatist. Very few people are prepared as they'd like to be to bring another life into the world.\n\n \n Being selfish is not illegal. Nor is abortion always selfish. No one but the woman involved get to decide if they want to give birth to a child unprepared.\n \n \n\n The vast majority of humanity is brought into the world without optimal resource allocation to them. Many who support abortion for this reason have an unrealistic ide of what's needed to raise a child. And, it's elitist to think that a child should be raised under their idea of proper child rearing and resource management.\n\n \n You're right, that is elitist. Good thing that pro-choice people do not believe that. Pro-life people believe that though. Pro-choice people believe the woman should decide these things for her own child. Pro-life people believe she has to give birth regardless of her situation... so they are dictating what resources she will have, in a sense. And I don't have to tell you that religions often dictate how children should be raised.\n \n \n\n It translates into the notion that the poor shouldn't have children. They can't afford it. Or the notion that having a child will make you poor as it parasitically sucks away the resources you need for yourself...entertainment and leisure funds dwindle. You have to work 'harder' or forgo that 'education' (that the majority of humanity really doesn't need or have in the 1st place).\n\n \n No, it translates into the notion that the poor should not have to have children if they do not wish to.\n \n \n\n And, if anyone wants to debate that legal abortions cause LESS harm than illegal ones, we can go there too.\n\n \n Sure.",

I do not.\n \nI understand the notion that we should let the mother 'decide' on such 'personal' issues. But, we simply don't do that consistantly. It's illegal for a mother to kill her nonsentient infant. It's illegal for her to abandon her kids who are parasitical. Privacy rights don't cover the ill treatment of another human. Prove to me it's not a human. The government and your neighbor is all up in your business all the time for every trivial matter.\n\n You see inconsistency where I do not.

   "Wow, step away for a bit and a flood of counter posts hit the thead. Do any of you have jobs or go to school :p Probably in differing time zones.\n \n \nWhich animals can be proven to be self-aware? Again, the decision was about legal 'personhood', and if AI were self-aware, we would probably have some serious questions to ask ourselves anyway. Severely retarded people are still self-aware unless they're vegetables, in which case the decision making would pass to next-of-kin. This is what happened in the Schiavo case.\n \n \n \n Your twisting of facts leaves much to be desired. There was no discussion whether or not she was still 'human', the discussion was on the matter of law. Her husband had the legal right to disconnect her. Her parents challenged that right in court. The husband and various others claimed Terry told them she would not want to be kept alive this way. The court accepted this and decided in his favor. The parents appealed... many times. Each time the courts decided in the husbands favor. btw, the husband got no money out of removing her from life-support; in fact he was offered millions to transfer custody over to others. It was a tragedy, but he had the right to do so.\n\n While I find it distatseful to do so, in the case of Schiavo, I'd have to agree that he husband got to rule in his wifes stead. Simply because the wife set precident with her choice of him as a mate and all that entails. But, this isn't just a legal arguement.\n The pertience of this is that she was human. You state (at least others do) that she isn't self aware (as far is presented to us, the average man on the street), so she's fair game for the chopping block so to say. Sounds plausable. He brains said to be flat lined by some. Will we use self awareness determinations for the permanently catatonic?\n It's not really twisting issues. A doctor says she's brain dead. She was supposed to have therapy. Others disagree with that assessment and want further testing. Either Mr. Schiavo want's to remove his wife for a personal agenda or her parents are saying a lot of nonsense to further their agenda. We won't know. Somehow, some proceedures wern't followed as ordered and her remains were promptly cremated...we'll never know for certain. All we can do is bitch at the end result or be a bobble header nodding in agreement with what we were presented with.\n \n \nEvidence? And, yes, it has been accepted before, just not by modern society. Infantcide has been practised in every culture in every time period, and in some cultures it was a valid practise.\n\n I never said infantcide wasn't practiced...but, then again so was slavery and other practices that we currently disagree with. Expanding knowledge and all that. Even in the realm of the abortion subject, we've learned a lot about fetuses in the past 30 years. So, should we continue with something just because we've always done it?\n \n \nThe difference being that there are a myriad of options open to the woman if she does not want an infant which do not physically harm it, while there is exactly one option open to her if she does not want a fetus. The situation is not morally comparable because the situations between a fetus in the woman and a born infant are vastly different.\n\n What are the 'myriad options'? Keep it or give it away? 2? Nope, and as you said, neither harm the infant. \n With child in the womb? Abort it or keep it? 2 still. And one option results in harm to the fetus and higher potential harm to herself than if she were to keep it.\n \n \nHas anyone challenged these murder laws? They cannot be struck down as inconsistent if no-one challenges them.\n Yes. Pro-abortion rights groups didn't like the laws. They simply failed. Anti-abortion sentiment is higher than it was years ago so more efforts and proposals currently exist to challenge them. Pro abortionst challenge the challenges.\n The laws themselves aren't inconsistant. Merely the treatment of the unborn by the law. On one hand, it's murder to terminate them. On the other, it's not.\n The partial birth ban bush and friends tried to get through passed by a decent margin until it was overturned by the decree of a few. Both sides do this so cries of partisanship and activist judges can be freely passed about.\n \n \nTruly? You must have a small circle of friends. I've found that pro-life people fit this much more.\n\n Nope, pretty expansive and world encompassing. It could be more to do about the debate styles that supportes of abortion often use. What they support and oppose on this subject. Most older supporters of abortion isses have a 'I don't care what you do so long as it's not to me' attitude. An in essence, selfish notion since they don't care about the other gitting something done to them. But, then this position can be supported by thier thinking that what's being eliminated isn't human (being) and then concoct a poor notion of what human 'being' is.\n Many pro-abortionist use financial issues as a basis for their support. Selfish. Many supporters haven't any real experience. I hate to be dismissive but some who champion your cause are pretty young and ill educated. But, I guess I'm not one to talk since I have the likes of VOR and religious nutters on my side. You look like Moe when you have Larry and Currly at your sides.\n So, while 'my side' isn't convincing in its rhetoric, neither is the otherside. But, while the anti-abortion side is somewhat coherant (using the becasue I say it's living human being) in it's unity against abortion. Proabortionist often use a wide variety of reasons why they support abortion. You say you don't think a mother should be saddled with an infant. Another will chime in how they don't want to feed another poverty mouth on their tax money. Cries of over population and others. It get's taxing. \n \n \nAgain, adoption is a parenting choice, not a pregnancy choice. You cannot give a fetus in the womb up for adoption (in the sense of actually giving it).\n Some would say that pregnancy (after consential sex) IS a step towards parenting and the known consequences of ones action.\n \n \nYour argument of \"just wait several months\" is just bad. That is the point, that women should not be forced, by law, to remain pregnant against their will and without their consent.\n\n As above, if they consented to voluntary intercourse, and the logical possibility of that action says you can get pregnant... \n Many anti-abortionist don't force one to keep a pregnancy if they were raped or due to incest. She's not being forced to keep the infant. She's being denied the ability to kill it. Subtle difference. But, since some desire to not see the unborn as 'human/persons' this is really an impass issue.\n A person is not allowed to kill something because she doesn't want it.\n Pro abortionist often (not always) don't see the fetus as a baby. hence a lot of problems with verbage used in these debates. Occasionally there'll be a slip in usage such as when a pro abortionist inadvertantly says child or baby when refering to a fetus in womb...but, rather than jump up in a lather and yell 'AH HA! A Freudian slip! You vile monster!' I try to take it as a simple slip when it appears. But, this slip happens more on the side of abortionist that it does for those opposed to it.\n \n \nBeing selfish is not illegal. Nor is abortion always selfish. No one but the woman involved get to decide if they want to give birth to a child unprepared.\n So it is the choice of the mother to determine whether the child/fetus is a human 'being'? With the couplation of fetal homicide laws, the only seperation on whether the unborn get's legal protection or not is by the mothers descision.\n \n \nYou're right, that is elitist. Good thing that pro-choice people do not believe that. Pro-life people believe that though. Pro-choice people believe the woman should decide these things for her own child. Pro-life people believe she has to give birth regardless of her situation... so they are dictating what resources she will have, in a sense. And I don't have to tell you that religions often dictate how children should be raised.\n\n And, while I paint pro-abortionist with an unfairly broad brush, you just did the same towards pro-lifers. Not all pro lifers think the same. There are debates as to usage of the morning after pill, rape and incest issues as well as medical considerations. Some will say no to all across the board. Others will pick and chose. \n So, you saying 'Pro-choice people do not believe that' is false. You can't speak for all pro-choicers. Just as I can't speak for all anti-abortionist or 'pro-lifers'.\n So I'm guilty of smacking a lot of people with my broad brush...at least I'm also painted in kind with yours. ;)\n \n \nNo, it translates into the notion that the poor should not have to have children if they do not wish to.\nThey don't. Just tell them not to have the S-E-X. To use contraceptives (most often FREE) correctly and excessively. \n \n To other issues, (more in depth on some)\n \n Person, Being. Somantical obsfucation to redefine and often limit other humans. No different that verbage used to justify slavery. \n \n In many cases, a severly retarded human is not self aware. Thus, guardianship and other care issues pass to another person. Still, they are protected by the law...currently.\n \n Some animals have and do express self awareness to the level that a child or young adult would. Most of these would be primates. Also, young infants aren't self aware. Most psychologist would state that. It's nearly self evident.\n \n If pro abortionist are stating that self awareness is the defining quality of a human 'being' then such traits of self awareness or lack there of shoud be consistantly used across the board.\n \n An infant still needs sustance, and suckling is the natural method. Most of the worlds mothers still use it.\n If you wish to use formula or a wet nurse or what ever, sure. You can give it away too once it's born. So long as you don't harm it and follow established proceedures for doing so, you get into no legal troubles.\n But, on the off chance that an unborn child IS human or even sentient or self aware, why abort it?\n \n As to Sinjin and others, no, it's NOT near term pregnanceies that are treated differently. That's a european issue that many who argue the abortion issue don't often grasp. In the US, you can get an abortion up to term. Recently there was a strong movement to limit this but, it was overturned. This is pretty well known to anyone debating this issue.\n The primary reason why a death of an unborn is considered to be murder has a lot to do with not only the mothers 'choice' but to law makers.\n \n In essence, you can abort the fetus of your own free will and it's not murder.\n If you lose the fetus to harm from another, it's a homicide.\n Not all abortions happen in the 1st or 2nd term.\n Not all 'homocides' of a fetus happen in the 3rd term.\n \n Fetal homiced and abortion have nothing to do with 'age' of fetus. but, you probably didn't know that thinking I'd be someone like VOR or yourself who spews nonsense and acts as if though it were the truth.\n \n Viability has NOTHING to do with fetal homicide. Really, you're as bad as VOR. makeing all these assumptions because they sound reasonable and support you claims. Kentucky initiated their fetal homocide policy after the death of a 21 week old fetus. Certainly not anything remotly viable. \n In Missouri and 17 other states, the laws recognize a fetus as living at the time of conception. So, I take it that either A) you're not american and can be forgiven of B) talking out of your XXX...spewing as you'd like to say.\n either way, you don't know what you're talking about.\n \n My question is, why is the fetus protected by the law in the case of fetal homicide yet, the same fetus isn't protected by law in the case of an abortion? The on;y answer I can find is the 'choice' of the mother. Even if she doesn't specifically state she's choising to keep it, it's implied since she hasn't dones anything about it otherwise.\n This has NOTHING to do with the actual condition of the unborn...sentient, self aware or human. It doesn't even matter. It's entirely up to the mother to make this distinction and choice. It's a 'Because I say so' case. And, there were recent threads here about the validity of such statements. \n \n There was even opposition to these bills by pro-abortionist since they believed it was circumnavigating RvW and would later be legal precidence against RvW (saying that a legal abortion was a fetal homicide) which wasn't the case. IIRC, 25-30ish states have foetal homicide laws. Laws designed to protect the unborn against harm EXCEPT in the case of an abortion.\n \n As to cultural history on abortion, I know full well about abortion before quickening of the fetus as well as compensations methods used when one accidentaly or intentionally caused the death of an unborn child.\n \n As to your 2 year old recognizing themselves in a mirror, so do chimpanzees. And, while I misstated 3-4 yr olds, the statement still holds true for younger infants up to about 20-24 months. And, are you going to tell me that a 6 month old can do the same? Yet, that 6 month old IS protected by the law and considered not only human but a human being as you call it. Baffles the mind. By most clinical definitions of self awareness, a child doesn't reach that level until ~2+. Sorry about the misstatement but, it doesn't invalidate the notion I pose that 'sefl awareness' , sentience, consciousness or other definitions is bunk when trying to justify a human being as something legally protected in the realms of abortion debates.\n \n So, clearly the sentience, self awareness issue isn't an absolute definition of what a human 'being' is.",

   "\n \"HAAHAHAHA, actually those numbers of \"millions\" of aboritons prior to 1973 have turned out to be false and just a made up number (if you read about the people that made that number you would find this out..they admitted it).\"\n \n\n \n What makes you think I am using \"them\" as a source? I would suggest you read the story you \"read about\" again. It is Nathanson, not \"people\", who makes the claim. However saying someone lied and proving that they did are two entirely different things. Nathanson said they lied...he hasn't proved it as such.\n Secondly, the figures you speak of that were supposedly based on lies is only exclusive to after the 1950s. We are talking about the 1930s. \n Lastly, using figures after the 1940s is highly skewed; therapeutic abortion was pretty much Roe v Wade lite and eliminated the use of criminal abortion in the middle and upper classes. \n Now, lets get to the facts. Our overall abortion rate was 22.9 in 1996 according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute. In 1930, Hamiliton published the rate of abortion in 1930 in specific social and economic groups in, \"Some Sociologic and Psychologic Observations on Abortion.\" The abortion rate in those of the upper/middle class was 24.3, for poor unmarried white women it was 64% and for minorities the abortion rate was 40%. \n So women were aborting probably about a third of their pregnancies in the 1930s. Stix's, \"A Study of Pregnancy Wastage\" puts the abortion rate at 35 percent or 35 abortions per 100 live births. \n \n \n \n \n\n \"To think that when it became legalized it went down is just stupid for lack of better term.\" \n\n \n Then why can't you explain an unreflective fertility and abortion rates between 1972-1979 here in America or how the Polish fertility rate never increased after the 1993 referendum that criminalized abortion? \n Prove to me when criminalizing abortion has ever decreased it's demand. So far you haven't...only provided empty rhetoric. The pro-life movement thoroughly brainwashes it's supporters to believe such jibberish. \n \n \n \n \n\n \"The amount went up after it was legalized and peaked in the 80s. It has sense gone down a bit and is leveling off (some suggest because of studies that have come out about abortion and the fact that people that don't support abortion has gone up sense the 80s and early 90s).\"\n\n \n It shot up as soon as Reagan launched his failed campaign of anti-sex education, cutting social services for the poor and destroying the US economy into a recession that favored the rich against the poor. Since social-economical reasons are often the reason why people have abortions it is no surprise we saw abortion sky-rocket under Reagan's political atmosphere that was hostile to lower class families. \n If people were becoming more against abortion in the 90s then how can you explain Clinton's popularity in winning two elections? The a friendlier economic atmosphere, contraception education and relief from Reaganism helped reduce the abortion rate. \n \n \n \n \n\n \"I take it you didn't look at any of the polls.\" \n\n \n 60% accepting Roe v Wade is a high figure don't you think? More people support abortion then the president. \n \n \n \n \n\n \"Most support abortion for the \"extreme\" cases only (in the US). So does President Bush.\"\n\n \n Then none of them are pro-life. To be pro-life means you respect the right to life for the fetus. You can't just pick and choose when abortion is right. \n \n \n \n \n\n Are you for limiting abortion to that? \n\n \n Limiting it to what?\n \n \n \n \n\n \"Not that it matter because Roe vs Wade struct down the Texas law that gave exceptions to the \"extreme\" cases.\" \n\n \n If you says so. \n http://www.publicagenda.com/issues/factfiles_detail.cfm?issue_type=abortion&list=16\n \n \n \n \n\n \"Your claim that \"Even those who supported legal abortion but were against PBAs aligned themselves as \"pro-life.\" \" Is unfounded unless you can prove this is true...the polls suggest otherwise.\" \n\n \n \"When the pro-life movement began in the early 70's, being pro-life meant you were 100% opposed to any and all abortion. In the early 80's, that standard was watered down to include those who had rape, incest, and the life of the mother exceptions. Now in the 90's, things have declined so rapidly that someone who is only opposed to partial-birth abortions can sell themselves as pro-life.\"- Pastor Matt Trewhella \n \n How does that crow taste?",

   "Wow, step away for a bit and a flood of counter posts hit the thead. Do any of you have jobs or go to school :p Probably in differing time zones.\n \n \n While I find it distatseful to do so, in the case of Schiavo, I'd have to agree that he husband got to rule in his wifes stead. Simply because the wife set precident with her choice of him as a mate and all that entails. But, this isn't just a legal arguement.\n The pertience of this is that she was human. You state (at least others do) that she isn't self aware (as far is presented to us, the average man on the street), so she's fair game for the chopping block so to say. Sounds plausable. He brains said to be flat lined by some. Will we use self awareness determinations for the permanently catatonic?\n It's not really twisting issues. A doctor says she's brain dead. She was supposed to have therapy. Others disagree with that assessment and want further testing. Either Mr. Schiavo want's to remove his wife for a personal agenda or her parents are saying a lot of nonsense to further their agenda. We won't know. Somehow, some proceedures wern't followed as ordered and her remains were promptly cremated...we'll never know for certain. All we can do is bitch at the end result or be a bobble header nodding in agreement with what we were presented with.\n \n \n I never said infantcide wasn't practiced...but, then again so was slavery and other practices that we currently disagree with. Expanding knowledge and all that. Even in the realm of the abortion subject, we've learned a lot about fetuses in the past 30 years. So, should we continue with something just because we've always done it?\n \n \n What are the 'myriad options'? Keep it or give it away? 2? Nope, and as you said, neither harm the infant. \n With child in the womb? Abort it or keep it? 2 still. And one option results in harm to the fetus and higher potential harm to herself than if she were to keep it.\n \n Yes. Pro-abortion rights groups didn't like the laws. They simply failed. Anti-abortion sentiment is higher than it was years ago so more efforts and proposals currently exist to challenge them. Pro abortionst challenge the challenges.\n The laws themselves aren't inconsistant. Merely the treatment of the unborn by the law. On one hand, it's murder to terminate them. On the other, it's not.\n The partial birth ban bush and friends tried to get through passed by a decent margin until it was overturned by the decree of a few. Both sides do this so cries of partisanship and activist judges can be freely passed about.\n \n \n Nope, pretty expansive and world encompassing. It could be more to do about the debate styles that supportes of abortion often use. What they support and oppose on this subject. Most older supporters of abortion isses have a 'I don't care what you do so long as it's not to me' attitude. An in essence, selfish notion since they don't care about the other gitting something done to them. But, then this position can be supported by thier thinking that what's being eliminated isn't human (being) and then concoct a poor notion of what human 'being' is.\n Many pro-abortionist use financial issues as a basis for their support. Selfish. Many supporters haven't any real experience. I hate to be dismissive but some who champion your cause are pretty young and ill educated. But, I guess I'm not one to talk since I have the likes of VOR and religious nutters on my side. You look like Moe when you have Larry and Currly at your sides.\n So, while 'my side' isn't convincing in its rhetoric, neither is the otherside. But, while the anti-abortion side is somewhat coherant (using the becasue I say it's living human being) in it's unity against abortion. Proabortionist often use a wide variety of reasons why they support abortion. You say you don't think a mother should be saddled with an infant. Another will chime in how they don't want to feed another poverty mouth on their tax money. Cries of over population and others. It get's taxing. \n \n Some would say that pregnancy (after consential sex) IS a step towards parenting and the known consequences of ones action.\n \n \n As above, if they consented to voluntary intercourse, and the logical possibility of that action says you can get pregnant... \n Many anti-abortionist don't force one to keep a pregnancy if they were raped or due to incest. She's not being forced to keep the infant. She's being denied the ability to kill it. Subtle difference. But, since some desire to not see the unborn as 'human/persons' this is really an impass issue.\n A person is not allowed to kill something because she doesn't want it.\n Pro abortionist often (not always) don't see the fetus as a baby. hence a lot of problems with verbage used in these debates. Occasionally there'll be a slip in usage such as when a pro abortionist inadvertantly says child or baby when refering to a fetus in womb...but, rather than jump up in a lather and yell 'AH HA! A Freudian slip! You vile monster!' I try to take it as a simple slip when it appears. But, this slip happens more on the side of abortionist that it does for those opposed to it.\n \n So it is the choice of the mother to determine whether the child/fetus is a human 'being'? With the couplation of fetal homicide laws, the only seperation on whether the unborn get's legal protection or not is by the mothers descision.\n \n \n And, while I paint pro-abortionist with an unfairly broad brush, you just did the same towards pro-lifers. Not all pro lifers think the same. There are debates as to usage of the morning after pill, rape and incest issues as well as medical considerations. Some will say no to all across the board. Others will pick and chose. \n So, you saying 'Pro-choice people do not believe that' is false. You can't speak for all pro-choicers. Just as I can't speak for all anti-abortionist or 'pro-lifers'.\n So I'm guilty of smacking a lot of people with my broad brush...at least I'm also painted in kind with yours. ;)\n \n They don't.

Somantical obsfucation to redefine and often limit other humans. No different that verbage used to justify slavery. \n \n In many cases, a severly retarded human is not self aware.

So long as you don't harm it and follow established proceedures for doing so, you get into no legal troubles.\n But, on the off chance that an unborn child IS human or even sentient or self aware, why abort it?\n \n As to Sinjin and others, no, it's NOT near term pregnanceies that are treated differently.

I enjoyed reading it. Yes, I said \"viability I should think\" because I didn't honestly know but in the Peterson case Lacy was 8 mo. gone IIRC. I stand corrected. In Missouri and 17 other states have they actually procecuted any case of \"fetal homicide\" for first trimester fetuses? I don't necessarily think that it is inappropriate to judge it homicide if the mother wished to bring the \"baby\" to term. No slip.\n \n Just as bad as VOR? Are you sure? Now that really hurts. emoticon_cry \n \n I'm sure you'll hate me for this semantic interlude but for me \"sentience\" is not synonymous with \"self awareness\".\n \n sen\u00b7tient - \n \n 1.

   "Sorry in advance, and retroactively, sometimes my posts are rambling and full of redundancies (just don't have the time to clean them up) :(\n \n \n I fully understand the position some try to take when they acknowledge the fetus as a human (living, growing 'form') and say that it isn't a person or being until born.\n \n Thus makes pseudo sense when you half think about it.\n But, IMO, it is a dangerous way of thinking. As I stated, it's subjective and open for interpretation on what makes a human being.\n \n We have consciousness, self awareness and similar things that reflect personality and thinking.\n \n \n But, the current apparent issue on what a human being is is highly subjective and not universally carried across the board.\n \n The current determination on whether the fetus/unborn baby is a being or not is determined by the mother. If SHE decides to keep it, it is one. If she passively lets it form, it is one...as reflected in fetal homicide laws.\n \n If SHE decides to terminate it...it isn't.\n \n Thus, the CHOICE in pro-choice isn't about choosing to keep it or not, but about whether someone thinks it's human or not.\n Any one who thinks it's human and chooses to abort it is, in essence murdering.\n \n Thus, you get my attack on subjectivism.\n I'm a pretty utilitarian person. It's not a trait some are happy with when it comes down to who is 'useful' and who is not. It's just a natural personality trait. It's probably not perfect and has sever flaws.\n My natural feelings are similar to some pro-abortionsist sentiments here. 3rd term is human, 1st term might not be. Simply based on form and capacity.\n But, I'm not omniscent in being able to really know if there is a difference other than either going on someone elses word or using subjective guidelines.\n I [i]feel/i] that 3rd term abortion is murder. I feel that use of the morning after pill isn't. But, my feelings don't make it reality.\n \n \n Earlier, I stated I agree with Cones analysis on playing it safe.\n In previous debates before on the now defunt Portent, I take the simple notion that the human form constitutes humanity and should be protected. If not actively then passivly.\n So, while I could compromise, it's not really based on anything factual, just my feelings.\n Do you want me to base other things on my feelings?\n I can agree with slavery for example...so long as it's the slavery of liberals (until they are reeducated) ;)",

   "I think most women have a valid reason for getting an abortion and lot more could be done to help both baby and mother if we addressed those reasons so she doesn't have to abort. But noooooo - it's all about stretch marks and labor pain to lifers. Nothing to address. Go ahead and ban abortions - then you can all get together and pat each other on the back completely blind blind to rights you have trampled and the damage you have done.\n\n \n I got some issues with this statement and hopefully you were just a bit upset at the time of writting it Jitobear (as you normally don't generalize)\n \n However, you did in this case. You say that pro-lifers all think that it is about stretch marks and labor pain which seems to me that you think pro-lifers are generalizing in a bad way. However you generalize the same as you claim pro-lifers do.\n \n I agree with Jitobear on the fact that we should help people more including women who are pregnant. However, the step shouldn't be fix the helping problem first then get rid of abortion. I feel abortion probably is part of the problem. Abortion seems to be selfish in itself so having it almost invites selfishness. Also, killing a baby is not going to solve in problems. Get rid of selfishness and we wouldn't be having this problem today.\n \n As for the right to abortion...where does this right come from and who gave it to you?",

Hence the ;)\n \n And, there's really nothing funny about people who think it's acceptable to murder people and to play with the definition on human being.\n If an unborn child/fetus, can simultaneously be deemed protected by law and those responsible for it's death punished AND capable of being aggressively removed from the uterous and casually killed and dumped with no consequences...I see a problem.\n All it takes is someones subjective choice to determing the 'value' of the life/potential life.\n There is no universal determination as of yet (or even culturally/socially) for quantifying where and/or what an unborn child/fetus is.\n So, if one person says it's a live and and another says it's not and both are right. The the same subjective capacities should be applied equally in all other cases. After all, we have recreational drug used deemed both good and bad, depending on who you talk to. We also have slavery deemed good and bad, once again depending on who you talk to. I prefer to accept that slavery is a good thing since I think I have a Sudanese relative who still practices it. I just prefer to do the old fashioned thing and enslave my political enemies...preferably after a nice war of conquest. And, once they have been conquored, they are no longer classified as human by my time honored and highy traditional practice. They become property.\n If it's not right for you, I can accept that.

Nor exercise your free speech.\n \n People every day engage in subjective judgements.\n If I think less of some generic classification of 'liberal' then too bad for those who wish it to apply to themselves. You're not born a liberal, you chose to accept the idealizations of one. If you prefer to identify yourself as a liberal, you might be a) young b) brainwashed c) more conservative than I am or d) all the above.\n \n Geesh, wake up and get over yourself. One mans liberal is anothers conservative. I have moderate leanings on many issues and pretty 'left' ones on others. Yet, no matter who's rights I champion nor the fact that I took my wifes last name upon marriage (I guess that makes me her property), I'll still be a goose-stepping communazi to someone out there...who hates women simply because I'm a man.\n \n \n \n If you don't get the irony, I guess I poured it on too thick.",

   "While I find it distatseful to do so, in the case of Schiavo, I'd have to agree that he husband got to rule in his wifes stead. Simply because the wife set precident with her choice of him as a mate and all that entails. But, this isn't just a legal arguement.\n\n \n Certainly it is. \"...husband got to rule in his wifes stead\", \"...the wife set precident(sic)\". Those are both legal statements.\n \n \n\n The pertience of this is that she was human. You state (at least others do) that she isn't self aware (as far is presented to us, the average man on the street), so she's fair game for the chopping block so to say. Sounds plausable. He brains said to be flat lined by some. Will we use self awareness determinations for the permanently catatonic?\n\n \n No, we use higher brain activity, which is an indication of consciousness. Terry did not even have the machinery anymore to support consciousness. She had lost cognitive neurological function, while maintaining the functions of the brainstem.\n \n \n\n It's not really twisting issues. A doctor says she's brain dead. She was supposed to have therapy. Others disagree with that assessment and want further testing. Either Mr. Schiavo want's to remove his wife for a personal agenda or her parents are saying a lot of nonsense to further their agenda. We won't know. Somehow, some proceedures wern't followed as ordered and her remains were promptly cremated...we'll never know for certain. All we can do is bitch at the end result or be a bobble header nodding in agreement with what we were presented with.\n\n \n Agreed, we will never know all the facts. This is unimportant. Your twisting was done when you stated the decision was made because she wasn't 'human' and tried to tie it into the abortion debate.\n \n \n\n I never said infantcide wasn't practiced...but, then again so was slavery and other practices that we currently disagree with. Expanding knowledge and all that. Even in the realm of the abortion subject, we've learned a lot about fetuses in the past 30 years. So, should we continue with something just because we've always done it?\n\n \n I was refuting your obviously erroneous claim of: That's never been accepted in regards to infantcide. It simply isn't accepted in our modern society.\n \n No, just because it is an old idea does not mean it is a good one.\n \n \n\n What are the 'myriad options'? Keep it or give it away? 2? Nope, and as you said, neither harm the infant. \n With child in the womb? Abort it or keep it? 2 still. And one option results in harm to the fetus and higher potential harm to herself than if she were to keep it.\n\n \n Do you practise being obtuse? You are reducing many options into 1 category and calling it equivalent to the 2 actual choices a pregnant woman has?\n \n The myriad options are to give it to family, which you cannot do with a fetus. Give it to friends, which you cannot do with a fetus. Give it to strangers, which you cannot do with a fetus. Give it to a hospital or firestation under the Safe Haven laws, which you cannot do with a fetus. You can give an infant up for adoption, which you cannot do with a fetus. A born infant can also be taken care of by others, if the mother needs to get away for a single night or a weekend. You cannot do this with a fetus.\n \n All of these are different options open to a woman with an infant that simply are not open to a pregnant woman. Name me even one other choice a pregnant woman has if she is not willing to care for the fetus.\n \n \n\n Yes. Pro-abortion rights groups didn't like the laws. They simply failed. Anti-abortion sentiment is higher than it was years ago so more efforts and proposals currently exist to challenge them. Pro abortionst challenge the challenges.\n The laws themselves aren't inconsistant. Merely the treatment of the unborn by the law. On one hand, it's murder to terminate them. On the other, it's not.\n The partial birth ban bush and friends tried to get through passed by a decent margin until it was overturned by the decree of a few. Both sides do this so cries of partisanship and activist judges can be freely passed about.\n\n \n I don't believe \"anti-abortion\" sentiment is higher. Polls consistently show most of the nation is pro-choice.\n \n \n\n Nope, pretty expansive and world encompassing. It could be more to do about the debate styles that supportes of abortion often use. What they support and oppose on this subject. Most older supporters of abortion isses have a 'I don't care what you do so long as it's not to me' attitude. An in essence, selfish notion since they don't care about the other gitting something done to them. But, then this position can be supported by thier thinking that what's being eliminated isn't human (being) and then concoct a poor notion of what human 'being' is.\n\n \n Ok. I'm not sure what your point is.\n \n \n\n Many pro-abortionist use financial issues as a basis for their support. Selfish. Many supporters haven't any real experience. I hate to be dismissive but some who champion your cause are pretty young and ill educated.\n\n \n Yet here you are showing yourself to be young and ill-educated. Financial issues are important. Contrary to popular believe, women cannot live on air, and pregnancies can be very expensive. There are issues that women do need addressed to have a successful pregnancy and financial issues are one of them.\n \n \n\n But, I guess I'm not one to talk since I have the likes of VOR and religious nutters on my side. You look like Moe when you have Larry and Currly at your sides.\n So, while 'my side' isn't convincing in its rhetoric, neither is the otherside. But, while the anti-abortion side is somewhat coherant (using the becasue I say it's living human being) in it's unity against abortion. Proabortionist often use a wide variety of reasons why they support abortion. You say you don't think a mother should be saddled with an infant. Another will chime in how they don't want to feed another poverty mouth on their tax money. Cries of over population and others. It get's taxing. \n\n \n This is because the pro-choice argument is strong on many different aspects of the issue. The pro-choice argument ranges from biological to medical to legal to moral, and has strong support on all aspects. There are even religious arguments, but I tend to dismiss those. \n \n You are right, the pro-life argument is simple and generally is the same.\n \n \n\n Some would say that pregnancy (after consential sex) IS a step towards parenting and the known consequences of ones action.\n\n \n Perhaps some would say that, but it is idiotic to use it as justification for forced pregnancy, by law. No law states that one must accept a certain consequence of your action if you can change it.\n \n \n\n As above, if they consented to voluntary intercourse, and the logical possibility of that action says you can get pregnant... \n Many anti-abortionist don't force one to keep a pregnancy if they were raped or due to incest. She's not being forced to keep the infant. She's being denied the ability to kill it. Subtle difference. But, since some desire to not see the unborn as 'human/persons' this is really an impass issue.\n\n \n Not so. Whether the \"unborn\" (this term amuses me, it makes me think of \"undead\" to describe the living) is a \"human/person\" is immaterial to this argument. I'll post a reply I made to someone about this very issue.\n \n \n\n Your argument is laughable. Let me see if I have this straight... Sex leads to pregnancy leads to childbirth. A leads to B leads to C. If you do A, you consent to C?\n \n Lets use your logic. You get drunk, walk home and go inside your house. You irresponsibly leave your keys in the door, more than that you leave your door ajar with your porch light off (A). A burglar sees your door ajar and walks inside(B). The burglar seals all of your stuff and rapes your daughter(C).\n \n A -< B -< C. Since C is a consequence of your action A, you cannot change C even if you are able to. You are not allowed to call the police, you cannot confront the burglar on your own.\n \n /snip/\n \n Ok, lets keep with this example. By crossing the street you consent to being hit by the bus, and you consent to any injuries you sustain, even death. If you are hit, do the doctors and ambulance drivers take one look at you and say \"You consented to these injuries when you crossed the street. We will not treat you\"?\n \n In the example of the burglar, if you call the police when you hear the burglar stealing your stuff, do they say \"That is a consequence of your own irresponsible actions. We will not help\"?\n \n How can we hold anyone accountable if you are hit by a bus? If crossing the street implies consent to being hit, why do we punish the bus driver?\n \n\n \n Some of this obviously does not apply to you, but the gist does.\n \n \n\n A person is not allowed to kill something because she doesn't want it.\n Pro abortionist often (not always) don't see the fetus as a baby. hence a lot of problems with verbage used in these debates. Occasionally there'll be a slip in usage such as when a pro abortionist inadvertantly says child or baby when refering to a fetus in womb...but, rather than jump up in a lather and yell 'AH HA! A Freudian slip! You vile monster!' I try to take it as a simple slip when it appears. But, this slip happens more on the side of abortionist that it does for those opposed to it.\n\n \n What we call it isn't important, except when it is useful to avoid confusion. Since this argument talks about both those who are born and those in the womb, using \"baby\" is prone to confusion. That is why some, such as myself, use \"fetus\".\n \n You are right, a person is not allowed to kill something because they do not want it. That is not the argument, exactly. A woman is allowed to kill the fetus because she cannot be forced, by law, to continue to share her body against her will and without her consent.\n \n \n\n So it is the choice of the mother to determine whether the child/fetus is a human 'being'? With the couplation of fetal homicide laws, the only seperation on whether the unborn get's legal protection or not is by the mothers descision.\n\n \n In a sense. The mother's decision decides whether it will continue living in her body. Whether or not the law recognizes the fetus as a 'person' doesn't affect that, or at least shouldn't.\n \n \n\n And, while I paint pro-abortionist with an unfairly broad brush, you just did the same towards pro-lifers. Not all pro lifers think the same. There are debates as to usage of the morning after pill, rape and incest issues as well as medical considerations. Some will say no to all across the board. Others will pick and chose. \n So, you saying 'Pro-choice people do not believe that' is false. You can't speak for all pro-choicers. Just as I can't speak for all anti-abortionist or 'pro-lifers'.\n So I'm guilty of smacking a lot of people with my broad brush...at least I'm also painted in kind with yours. ;)\n\n \n Nice try ;) However, even you say: while the anti-abortion side is somewhat coherant (using the becasue I say it's living human being) in it's unity against abortion. Proabortionist often use a wide variety of reasons why they support abortion.\n \n The pro-life argument has a single messege, which lends itself greatly to being painted with a wide brush. You cannot say the same of the pro-choice argument with they're wide base of support.\n \n \n\n They don't. Just tell them not to have the S-E-X. To use contraceptives (most often FREE) correctly and excessively. \n\n \n I agree. Everyone should use contraceptives. Yet, people still have sex and have unwanted pregnancies. This does not solve the problem.\n \n \n\n Person, Being. Somantical obsfucation to redefine and often limit other humans. No different that verbage used to justify slavery. \n\n \n May I just say, the pro-life proposed actions are the same as those used by slave-owners? Which is worse, the verbage or the actions?\n \n Did you know, Hitler professed Christian ideals? Does this now mean that all Christians support Nazism?\n \n \n\n In many cases, a severly retarded human is not self aware. Thus, guardianship and other care issues pass to another person. Still, they are protected by the law...currently.\n\n \n Evidence? Which severly retarded people are not self-aware? \n \n Also, what is your point?\n \n \n\n Some animals have and do express self awareness to the level that a child or young adult would. Most of these would be primates. Also, young infants aren't self aware. Most psychologist would state that. It's nearly self evident.\n \n If pro abortionist are stating that self awareness is the defining quality of a human 'being' then such traits of self awareness or lack there of shoud be consistantly used across the board.\n\n \n Self-awareness is not the sole requirement for being a human 'being'.\n \n \n\n An infant still needs sustance, and suckling is the natural method. Most of the worlds mothers still use it.\n If you wish to use formula or a wet nurse or what ever, sure. You can give it away too once it's born. So long as you don't harm it and follow established proceedures for doing so, you get into no legal troubles.\n But, on the off chance that an unborn child IS human or even sentient or self aware, why abort it?\n\n \n Because a woman still should not be forced by law to remain pregnant against her will and without her consent. Because the fetus still does not and should not have rights superior to the woman carrying it.\n \n \n\n So, clearly the sentience, self awareness issue isn't an absolute definition of what a human 'being' is.\n\n \n Nor is it an absolute definition of what a 'person' is under the law.",

Your one up on many lifers in recognizing that! emoticon_xgood \n \n Finances, medical situations, medicational situations, access to medical care, age, health status, mental health status, support network, level of safety - ALL impact pregnancy and are not the same for every woman. But the pro-life side dismisses all that - and just wants to ban abortion. They refuse the acknowledge that there issues that are serious and will now get ignored since that would simply negate their \"woman as selfish demon\" argument.\n \n \nBut, most often, it's over with in less than a year and the most commonly annoying part in 3 months.\n\n \n Try closer to two years and that is only if you decide NOT to be a parent.\n \n \nIf you're not too self centered and have developed a decent relationship with a mate, they should be treating you like a queen.

Besides, until a woman has had a penis with all those sensory nerve endings congregated in one small spot, they really don't know what pain is.\n\n \n The discomfort of pregnancy has very little to do with pain. However if it's all an illusion - may I take a sledge hammer to your balls? emoticon_xangel \n \n FYI - the clitoris has MORE nerve endings - and is smaller.\n \n \nLinus, it's not cohercing child birth you dits, it's preventing murder.\n\n \n It's not murder. Go ask a lawyer. Murder is a legal term. And forcing a woman to remain pregnant against her will is coercing child birth. It can't not be.\n \n \nIf you don't wants to have the baby, don'ts have the sexs.\n\n \n If you are going to talk about sex, learn to spell it. Anyway - it's about whether one wants or can be pregnant - not whether one wants children.\n \n \nAnd, do you really think that many doctors would participate in abortion practices if it wern't lucrative? \n\n \n Yep. I know this may be hard for you to believe, but there are lots of people out there - men and women - who really do care about women's health issues.\n \n \nOh, and unlike other surgeries, a minor doesn't need to notify their parents or legal guardian.\n\n \n This varies from state to state and where it does exist usually a judge has to emancipate the minor first.\n \n For example - my sister in law used to work in one of the largest domestic violence centers in the country. One of her clients was a 12 year girl, pregnant by her own father - with her mother having consented to him having sex with his daughter. Both parents were forcing her to keep the baby. A judge emancipated her at midnight so she could have an abortion. Girl is now in foster care and her \"parents\" are in jail.",

   "I don't understand...preventing murder? Not too sure what \"cohercing\" is but you guys support coercion childbirth just like China supports coercion abortion. You and the Chinese have a similar thought pattern as we can see; a common resentment of women during pregnancy. \n Try to make yourself more coherent next time. I am not going to waste my time trying to decipher pro-life jibberish. \n\n You soo don't want to open up the grammar police and spelling nazi. A typo or misspelt word shouldn't cause too much of a fuss.\n \n And, of course you refuse to understand, it's only been said severa hundred times on this forum, if you believe the unborn to be considered to be equivelant ot a live human adult, then killing it/ending it's 'life' is the same as murder. Thus, stopping an abortion prevents a murder. Andm there is ni resentment towards pregnant women. I'm curious as to where you get this notion.\n \n \n \nIf you don't want to be hijacked on an airplane then don't be on one. \n Sex does not equal consent to have a baby. \n Try again.\n\n Since this topic spans several threads and pages, and I have stated previously that some don't oppose abortion for rape or incest reasons, then you should bark up a different tree as most abortions don't happen for those reasons but as a result of consentual sex.\n \n Oh, and I've only ever flown in privatly owned aircraft. Someone would have to have a particular hate-on for me to hijack any plane I'd ever be in.\n \n \n \nLucrative compared to what? Working fast food? Consider the other major players...\n\n Hmmm, you don't know a lot about medicine do you? Less concerns about malpractice issues since few can bring a decent case or would care to. Cash and carry business (so much so it's stated that organized crime has been involved due to limited record keeping). If a man can make a decent chunk of change hosting Botox parties, one can make a decent living performing a service no others will. It doesn't take too much knowlege to learn to scrape a fetus out of a uterous and since you say. \n \n \n \nAdoption? No, baby brokers get around $10,000 a sale for every perfectly healthy white baby sold. Not to mention they get more $$$ if they don't adopt the child and collect money from the government instead.\n Obstetrician? No, obstetricians get over a thousand for every baby birthed.\n Criminal abortionists? They often jack the price of a regular abortion and don't have to worry about pro-lifers protesting. A very easy job. \n Your regular run of the mill abortionist? Not very lucrative. They get paid maybe a few hundred per abortion but have to resist pro-life sponsored terrorism, threats and hate on a daily basis. Doesn't sound like a very fun job but God bless them for dealing with whackos such as yourself. These individuals have incredible inner strength that the pro-life movement could only dream of having. \n\n White baby? Overlooking the people going to foreign markets to get one. \n No loose strings in an abortion or failed deals as the mother changes her mind later as in an adoption.\n Besides, have YOU ever adopted a child?\n I've got 3. I've said so before. Youngest was 9 months when I got her. Perfectly healthy baby. White too. emoticon_rolleyes price...$1,500 total for legal retainer. What a deal. I'm sure some cost more but, it's a 'sellers market' at times. And, all the ex-portent people can back me on this claim, it's not something I'm making up to be flippant.\n Several hundred a pop at several thousand a year. It adds up. And the anti-abortion terrorism is way media over blown. Most 'terrosists' didn't do it for political reasons like Rudolph stated but becasue of personal issues. But, I doubt you've ever listened to a confession or read the results of an investigation on the crime.\n It's something pro-abortionist like to spout off. Terrorism. You sound like Bush.\n You're about as 'whacko' as I am you dumb XXX. You seem to keep mixing up your players here and talking out of your XXX.\n you have no knowledge of what abortionist doctors think or the reasons why they perform their job. So, quit making assumptions that they have any more inner strength than anyone else or have to put up with anti-abortionist all the time.\n \n \n \nShucks! So you are saying they are like any other doctors? Obstetricians often talk women into c-sections just so they can get that extra $$$ on the side. But you won't hear the pro-life movement get all outraged by that. You need to do some research, kido. If you think abortionists should get special treatment you are dead wrong. American adoption agencies are extremely corrupt and often flush children into dangerous homes just so they can get rid of them and cut expenses.\n\n Bwahahaha, yopu really work with any doctors? My wife can only deliver by cesarian as she doesn't dialate. My mother works research now in at the University of Louisville and has 30yrs medical experience. I've worked close with them at times. You on one had say that they try to milk extra funds from women for 'unnecessary' surgery and then say that an abortionist doctor is autruistic in nature and doesn't do a job for pay.\n Psst, it's not amercan adoption agencies...it's Child Protective Services that often try to place children just to get them out of state run homes. I've worked in a juvinile shelter before, I know that they try to shuffle children on to foster parents to empty the facility...because a new batch is coming in too quickly. \n \n I'm getting the impression that you're not an American and definatly know Jack and Sphit about anything you are talking about. \n \n \nBut no outrage over the thousand some women who die from c-sections? I don't recall the pro-life movement ever caring about women dying from back-alley abortions then and I don't see why you'd care about then dying from legal abortions now.\n\n Never said there wasn't outrage so it's a straw man. Besides, as you seem to want to think many C-sections aren't necessary (and some probably aren't) most still are needed. And a woman won't have one if she doesn't have too. If you think stretch marks are a concern of a woman, a hari-kari scar across the mid section can mess up a bathing suit. Get real. Do you even have the numbers on how many C-sections to natural births there are? Ever wonder why women died in child birth more often before their use. 100yrs ago, my wife would be dead.\n The point is, ephedra (used for centuries) was linked to 155 deaths in america and it was pulled from the shelves. Morning after pill has caused a few dozen IIRC, no consideration by the FDA to remove it...and it's perfectly easy to get OTC. Encouraged even by a whole host of people. The FDA has pulled medication off the shelves for less related deaths but the morning after pill isn't touched.\n As to abortions, it's a procedure that should be over night. Not out patient. You don't have a kid walk in, scrap several pounds of flesh out of her and send her on her way as is commonly done. C-sections are in patient operations so you're kept a while for observations. Not allowed to wander off to hemorrhage in ignorance as has happened. And, as previously mentioned, malpractice isn't that common in abortion cases. It could be years later before you realize you want children and find out your abortion scarred your uterous to sterility.\n But, I'm sure you don't want to address these issues.\n \n \n \nYou must have never heard of Human Life Dynamics; they specialize in only suing abortionists.\n \n Any statistics on the numbers of cases per abortion mishaps they have. 1 in 100? 1 in 1 million. It's still in the psychological realm and doctor patient confidentiality. As many pro-choicers even attest, a woman who recieves an abortion doesn't often do so lightly and with as many documented cases can easily be unsettled by the event and treated poorly by others if it were made known. So the odds are less of a woman reporting an abortion malpractice issue than say that of a cesarian malpractice issue. Couple that wth the secret nature many have with abortion and you'll have a very slight percentage. A father who's daughter dies all of a sudden to a hemorrhage might not easily be able to tell if she had a recent legal or illegal abortion and with assistance might even find it hard to determine who performed the operation.\n So, yes, while Life Dynamicsmay exists, I do question how successful they are and then numbers of cases they have had.\n And, on a cursory glance I've only found a simple listing of ~350 woman reported dead from abortion mishaps. Blackmun wall I don't know how much credance I'd place it that for starters.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nSo?\n\n So...meaning you haven't a clue about Americans treatment of minors it appears.\n In nearly every case in dealing with a minor, a parent or legal guardian has to give consent. You can't even hand out medication to one without consent from a guardian. They can't enter into contracts not get surgery performed with out legal consent.\n Except in the case of an abortion. Where she get's to consent (as a minor) to an operation involving a pretty hefty life descision. \n \n It's another double standard.\n \n \n \n @Sigma,\n \nNo, we use higher brain activity, which is an indication of consciousness. Terry did not even have the machinery anymore to support consciousness. She had lost cognitive neurological function, while maintaining the functions of the brainstem.\n\n Says her husband and the original doctors.\n Her parents disageed with this. An investigation IIRC was supposed to happen it didn't. While I tentativle agree that she was 'brain dead' I personally don't know factually. No autopsy was performed and her remains were cremated. Pretty severe. Also, if it's to be believed that Terri would never have consented to cremation, then it's possible that she'd never have desired to have herself disconected. But, that's a mere assumption. I'm nominally catholic but, I'll be cremated upon death and I'd wissh to have myself disconected. In this case, it was 15 years. No improvement...\n Merely (IMO) her parents not wishing to let go. I can understand that. But, Terri did chose her husband...right or wrong. \n \n As agreed it matters little other than in the definition of what human is (subjective). Many attach higher brain function 9consciousness) to this but, that doesn't prevent the ability of some to disconect life support (I have a thread in the lower forums on Texas entitled Spiros Nikolouzos that deals with conscious infants who's care is deemed futile in TX (Knya Howard) and they will be treated same as Terri.\n It's (IMO) subjective determinations on what a human is (or human 'being' or 'person' or what ever term you chose to apply). many don't see the unborn as such and thus it isn't murder to eliminate/kill them.\n \n As to option, they are still 2. You keep it or you don't. How you don't keep the baby is irrelevant. You're not keeping it. Same as for abortion. Trying to say that not keeping it is broken down into sub groupings and each sub grouping of 'not keeping it' is a seperate choice is pretty slick. \n \n Also,\n \nI don't believe \"anti-abortion\" sentiment is higher. Polls consistently show most of the nation is pro-choice.\n\n \nAnti-abortion sentiment is higher than it was years ago so more efforts and proposals currently exist to challenge them.\n\n \n \nYet here you are showing yourself to be young and ill-educated.\nActually, unlike some here, I list my age (currently 35) on my profile. Also, I'm a honors grad from University of Louisville. \n \n My point was that most of those here and elsewhere who often champion the pro-choice issue are often youthful. College aged. Some do come from other walks of life but they aren't the most vocal in these types of debates. Just like the 'pro-lifers' get steriotyped...just look at the dozens of posts here that bash the righties. I could quote them if I had the time.\n \n But the issue was financial reasons to get an abortion. Simply most people aren't as financial as they'd desire when they have a child. Mater of factly, most people say they need 20% more income than they have to be happy. And it's always 20% more. Increase it and it's still another 20% on top of that. I've adopted and it's still nice to have more money and I got mine fairly cheap. \n \n As to the actions of pro-lifers. Explain.\n And, please don't say that a single person like Rudolph is ALL of the pro-lifers. I want to know how the pro-lifers are like slave owners.\n \n The fundamental difference is how we view the unborn. Simple as that.\n If it's nothing more than a lump of tissue, then it's no big deal to remove it as your side states. If it's the equivelant of an adult human, it should be protected under the same considerations.\n Currently there is no universal definition of what it is. As such, we're free to subjectively determin for ourselves.\n If I think it's 'alive' should I not seek to protect it? Or, because it's legal to kill it, allow it to happen?\n \n The reason why spro-abortionist have wide support is they believe in eliminating the unborn for a wide variety of reasons. Not for any one. The pro-lifers want to preserve a life. That's often the common thread amongst us. \n \n I use the term 'unborn' as I try to pose neutrally as possible. It's all about verbage and useful analogies for persuasion. Unborn is neither Child nor fetus. Pro-lifers will use reinforcive words like CHILD and pro-choicers fetus. I'd naturally use child but, that may be viewed as pro-lifer rhetoric.\n \n \n As to your A-B-C arguement. It's not correct. A leads to C is the sex leads to pregnancy.\n In the A-B-C case, you get drunk, while drunk you invite a thief into your home and then pass out. Thief steals you blind. You didn't just accidently leave the door open, you invited them in. Maybe not in your right mind (you're drunk/in love) but you still gave consent to an act that has a result that's consistant.\n lso this would tie in with the Terri Schiavo case, She did chose to marry him for all the results that entails good or bad. You do chose to engage in consentual sex for all the good or ill that entails. It's implicit in the act. No one evr guarantees a marriage will be trouble fee and wonderful and no one can guarantee that you won't get pregnant from sex. And, while you may get a divorce, that doens't prevent you from having to deal with the consequesnces of that marriage (financial for example) and getting a divorce can take as long to accomplish as having the baby.\n \n As to hitler being a christian? That's nice. I'm not nor never made the claim to be. Often another bit of contention with pro-choicers. As witnessed on this forum, too many people use a large paint brush against their opponents. Treating them all alike. I try not to myself buy, it's fun sometimes, so other than mocking people I usually let it ride.\n \n The point is I'm not the one who's trying to define who and who should not be protected. I didn't even invent the self-awareness or sentient or conscious determinations for 'being' or 'person'. As I'm 4hrs already past me bed time I'm not sure off hand which pro-lifer made those statements but, they are verbage used to say who is worthy and who not of protection.\n These debates used to come up a lot on Portent (previous forum some of us expats posted on) on what constitutes 'human' in the esoteric notions.\n \n But, yes, some severly retarded people fall into the classification of non-self aware. For some this distinction means nothing...maybe like yourself. But, it's a statement used to defend against those pro-choicers (remember where I said you all have differing reasons for believing as you do* which means pro-lifers who want to debate have to know more than you guys do since all you have to often say is 'stop getting your education from the bible') who make distinctions. \n There's the mirror/rouge test for self awareness. Chimps have passed it. Other animals too at times. New borns nope and severly retarded and others failed. \n \n \nBecause the fetus still does not and should not have rights superior to the woman carrying it.\n\n Says you. ;) And, we're not talking superior rights. We're talking equal rights. And, in many cases it does. Others it doesn't.",

   "@simone, great for you...now, tell me, where does that give you the ability to speak for ALL women???\n \n See, I can do the SAME survery of pregnant women that you can. After all, you only have your personal experience to go on.

   "\n @Sigma,\n \n Says her husband and the original doctors.\n Her parents disageed with this. An investigation IIRC was supposed to happen it didn't. While I tentativle agree that she was 'brain dead' I personally don't know factually. No autopsy was performed and her remains were cremated. Pretty severe. Also, if it's to be believed that Terri would never have consented to cremation, then it's possible that she'd never have desired to have herself disconected. But, that's a mere assumption. I'm nominally catholic but, I'll be cremated upon death and I'd wissh to have myself disconected. In this case, it was 15 years. No improvement...\n Merely (IMO) her parents not wishing to let go. I can understand that. But, Terri did chose her husband...right or wrong. \n\n \n True, we will never know. At least you accept that others have the legal right to decide for those who cannot make decisions.\n \n \n\n As agreed it matters little other than in the definition of what human is (subjective). Many attach higher brain function 9consciousness) to this but, that doesn't prevent the ability of some to disconect life support (I have a thread in the lower forums on Texas entitled Spiros Nikolouzos that deals with conscious infants who's care is deemed futile in TX (Knya Howard) and they will be treated same as Terri.\n It's (IMO) subjective determinations on what a human is (or human 'being' or 'person' or what ever term you chose to apply). many don't see the unborn as such and thus it isn't murder to eliminate/kill them.\n\n \n I don't think whether or not Terri was a human 'being' or a 'person' mattered in the determination.\n \n \n\n As to option, they are still 2. You keep it or you don't. How you don't keep the baby is irrelevant. You're not keeping it. Same as for abortion. Trying to say that not keeping it is broken down into sub groupings and each sub grouping of 'not keeping it' is a seperate choice is pretty slick. \n\n \n I believe your reduction of the woman's choices in this case to a category in order to compare it to abortion is intellectually dishonest.\n \n All of the options I mentioned were qualitatively different. They require different levels of involvement by the mother and different amount of effort by the mother and may require expenses on the part of the mother, and each can be specifically chosen by the mother. They are distinct options. Even if you reduce those options down to the category of \"giving it away\", it would need to be qualified as to how it was given away as each of those provide different levels of care, and the impact to the child is different depending on which is chosen (allowing family or friends to care for it is generally preferable to the adoption system, adoption being what it is). This isn't comparable to abortion because the woman generally doesn't choose which abortion procedure is performed, there are different procedures doctors use in the appropriate situation, and all result in the death of the fetus. There is no question as to what happens to it afterwards.\n \n Also, you chose to ignore that a woman can have the born child temporarily taken care of by another, as in babysitting.\n \n \n\n Actually, unlike some here, I list my age (currently 35) on my profile. Also, I'm a honors grad from University of Louisville. \n\n \n Young does not necessarily refer to chronological age, it is also a state of mind. It can also refer to one being inexperienced or childish\n \n \n\n My point was that most of those here and elsewhere who often champion the pro-choice issue are often youthful. College aged. Some do come from other walks of life but they aren't the most vocal in these types of debates. Just like the 'pro-lifers' get steriotyped...just look at the dozens of posts here that bash the righties. I could quote them if I had the time.\n\n \n Your point?\n \n \n\n But the issue was financial reasons to get an abortion. Simply most people aren't as financial as they'd desire when they have a child. Mater of factly, most people say they need 20% more income than they have to be happy. And it's always 20% more. Increase it and it's still another 20% on top of that. I've adopted and it's still nice to have more money and I got mine fairly cheap. \n\n \n And yet, financial issues are still important. A woman who can barely feed herself or perhaps her other children would be in a financial crisis. I do not believe that forcing her to continue her pregnancy by law is the correct thing to do, in addition to being oppressive. \n \n \n\n As to the actions of pro-lifers. Explain.\n And, please don't say that a single person like Rudolph is ALL of the pro-lifers. I want to know how the pro-lifers are like slave owners.\n\n \n I'm not talking about what they are doing, I am talking about what they are proposing happen. Namely, requiring women continue their pregnancies by law. Slaveowners controlled their slaves reproductive lives through law as well. If a slave got pregnant a slaveowner could force them through an abortion, and if the slave didn't want to continue the pregnancy the owner could force them to continue it. Forcing women to continue pregnancies, by law, is putting them as second class citizens and giving what is growing inside them greater rights than the woman herself. I believe that is abhorrent.\n \n \n\n The fundamental difference is how we view the unborn. Simple as that.\n\n \n No, it's a difference in how we view women. I can agree with your view of a fetus that it deserves protection just like any of us, yet still believe the woman (indeed, a man as well) has the right not to have anyone, even a person or a human 'being', attached to her body against her will and without her consent. You, however, believe women's ownership and right to her own organs and bodily processes does not exist or ends when she becomes pregnant.\n \n \n\n If it's nothing more than a lump of tissue, then it's no big deal to remove it as your side states. If it's the equivelant of an adult human, it should be protected under the same considerations.\n Currently there is no universal definition of what it is. As such, we're free to subjectively determin for ourselves.\n If I think it's 'alive' should I not seek to protect it? Or, because it's legal to kill it, allow it to happen?\n\n \n I believe it's undisputed that, whatever it is, it is alive and has human DNA. Even if it is the \"equivelant of an adult human\", I would believe a woman should be able to have an abortion.\n \n \n\n The reason why spro-abortionist have wide support is they believe in eliminating the unborn for a wide variety of reasons. Not for any one. The pro-lifers want to preserve a life. That's often the common thread amongst us. \n\n \n Agreed, however pro-choice people also want to preserve life. If there was a way to remove the fetus from the woman without harming either do you think many abortions would be performed? The focus is the woman for pro-choice people. The focus is the fetus for pro-life people. Each disregards the rights of the focus of the other in favor of their own focus.\n \n \n\n I use the term 'unborn' as I try to pose neutrally as possible. It's all about verbage and useful analogies for persuasion. Unborn is neither Child nor fetus. Pro-lifers will use reinforcive words like CHILD and pro-choicers fetus. I'd naturally use child but, that may be viewed as pro-lifer rhetoric.\n\n \n \"Fetus\" is the most neutral term, since it simply refers to a stage of development. \"Unborn\" is a PC term, like \"height challenged\". It amuses me to no end that the same people who spit with disgust on PC terms use this euphemism. The term also amuses me because I think \"undead corpse\" whenever I hear \"unborn infant\".\n \n \n\n As to your A-B-C arguement. It's not correct. A leads to C is the sex leads to pregnancy.\n In the A-B-C case, you get drunk, while drunk you invite a thief into your home and then pass out. Thief steals you blind. You didn't just accidently leave the door open, you invited them in. Maybe not in your right mind (you're drunk/in love) but you still gave consent to an act that has a result that's consistant.\n\n \n ETA, yes it is correct. Few refute that sex can lead to pregnancy(A-<B); it can be prevented but not controlled. However, my contention is that pregnancy(B) -< childbirth(C) or pregnancy(B) -< abortion(C) while you say pregnancy(B) -< childbirth(C) alone. A -< B -< C, sex leads to pregnancy leads to childbirth, and the pro-life argument is if you consent to A you consent to C. If it was only that you consent to becoming pregnant but not to birthing a child abortion would still be allowed since you could stop from giving birth. This very debate is about that 3rd step.\n \n Leaving your door open is not consent to being burglarized, nor is it consent to being killed in your bed. Also, regardless if you consent to them coming in your home, if they steal your stuff or plop down on the couch, eat your food and refuse to leave (and give you a punch in the gut every once in the while) you are perfectly able to kick them out or call the police to remove them. Consent to the original action in no way obligates you to allow them to remain in your house, let alone attached to your body. Only if there is a legal agreement can the intruder have a legal claim in staying in your house. Unless you suggest women (for only women can be pregnant) sign a legal document every time they have sex you have no basis for claiming the fetus has a legal right to be attached to her.\n \n \n\n lso this would tie in with the Terri Schiavo case, She did chose to marry him for all the results that entails good or bad. You do chose to engage in consentual sex for all the good or ill that entails. It's implicit in the act. No one evr guarantees a marriage will be trouble fee and wonderful and no one can guarantee that you won't get pregnant from sex. And, while you may get a divorce, that doens't prevent you from having to deal with the consequesnces of that marriage (financial for example) and getting a divorce can take as long to accomplish as having the baby.\n\n \n True, but no law states you cannot change any of those consequences if you are able to. You are able to take marriage counseling if you do not want a divorce (even if it is a possible consequence of cheating), and you can have an abortion if you do not want to give birth.\n \n \n\n As to hitler being a christian? That's nice. I'm not nor never made the claim to be. Often another bit of contention with pro-choicers. As witnessed on this forum, too many people use a large paint brush against their opponents. Treating them all alike. I try not to myself buy, it's fun sometimes, so other than mocking people I usually let it ride.\n\n \n You seem to be under a misconception. The implication of what I said was \"Obviously Christians are not like Hitler even if Hitler espoused Christian beliefs, just as pro-choice people are not like slavers even if slavers espoused beliefs similar\". Evolution is not invalid nor is it oppressive even if Hitler believed it or tried to use it as justification for racial cleansing. Conversely, Stalin is compared to Hitler because their actions were similar (killings of mass numbers of people) even if their philosophies were polar opposites. In this way I compare pro-life people to slavers because their proposed actions mirror those of slavers.\n \n Really, you need to stop assuming, Zardoz.\n \n \n \n\n But, yes, some severly retarded people fall into the classification of non-self aware.\n\n \n Evidence? Which ones?\n \n \n\n For some this distinction means nothing...maybe like yourself. But, it's a statement used to defend against those pro-choicers (remember where I said you all have differing reasons for believing as you do* which means pro-lifers who want to debate have to know more than you guys do since all you have to often say is 'stop getting your education from the bible') who make distinctions. \n\n \n I don't believe that is necessarily so. Much of the pro-life argument is attempting to attack the reasoning behind pro-choice arguments. So, while the pro-life argument itself is a one-trick pony, you make up for it by trying to discover inconsistencies and create logic-traps for the pro-choice argument. So pro-choice people have to create consistent arguments across the board and know how to create it using sound logical principles while pro-life people have the easy job of attacking those arguments.\n \n \n\n There's the mirror/rouge test for self awareness. Chimps have passed it. Other animals too at times. New borns nope and severly retarded and others failed.\n\n \n In what way have they failed it, and can you link to where it says newborns are not self-aware? \n \n Also, what is your point?\n \n \n\n Says you. ;) And, we're not talking superior rights. We're talking equal rights. And, in many cases it does. Others it doesn't.\n\n \n Yes, says me. That's why I said \"should\", because I recognize you might get your way.\n \n In the pregnancy relationship, one participant necessarily has inferior rights. If there is one resource (the body) you and I cannot have equal rights to the use of it. If there is one hamburger, you and I cannot have equal rights to it as a whole. You may say \"cut it in half and it's equal\" but then I have the rights to half a hamburger instead. Also, the human body cannot be divided in that way. The waters are further muddied if you legally own the hamburger and I came along later and had to have it in order to live.\n \n The fetus' use of the body denies the woman the use of the same resource within the body. They cannot have equal rights to the body because if the woman does not want her organs and life processes used and the fetus is using them, whose rights to the use of the body do you support? You cannot support them both equally. If you support the fetus' right to use her body then the fetus' rights are superior to the woman's rights to her own body. That makes her rights inferior to the fetus' rights. That makes her a second class citizen (after men and fetuses).",

   "True, we will never know. At least you accept that others have the legal right to decide for those who cannot make decisions.\n\n Legal rights and morality don't always jive with one another.\n While they have a legal right to speak for another it's how that right is derived. In the case of marriages, it's implicit that by chosing your mate, you agree with their descisions that they will make for you. This could be seen as a derivitive of common notions that 'two become one.' If you do not agree with your partners choices, you can set up some other alternative. Likea living will. Terri chose her husband. She did not chose her parents.\n For example, bot my wife and I disagree with removal of feeding tubes. We disagree on the subject of other life support issues. She would keep me on heart lung machines and I'd chose to disconnect them. Thus, we either honor wach others choices or set a legal binding statement for our own care.\n \n A child didn't chose the parent. So, while the child possess less legal rights in some situations, I would take it that the child has a right to life unless it stated other wise. Currently, children are incapable of making an informed descision in certain matters.\n In some situations, a parent, who is the natural arbiter of their childs welbeing has been brought to court and removed. This is usually only done for the safety of the child. An example would be the contradiction between a parents constitutional right of religion and the childs physical welbeing when they need a life saveing medical proceedure.\n The law has typically always sided on the issue of protection. Thus, the unborn (IF it were to be considered human) would be protected by law for it's continued wellbeing. \n \n \nI don't think whether or not Terri was a human 'being' or a 'person' mattered in the determination.\n\n Some would say it did. And many have argued that point.\n Had she been classified as such, most law makers would have issued protections. Over time, our thinking on such issues has gone back and forth.\n For example, a soldier in Iraq is/was facing charges for a mercy killing of a mortally wounded Iraqi. He was going to die in agonizing pain and was quite far gone, so the US serviceman shot him. In this case, the officer is charged for hastening a death.\n In the case of (for example) Sun Hudson in Texas, it was deemed futile to continue life support so the infant was removed and died due to it.\n It is often held that it is a somewhat common practice for doctors to hasten the death of those severly in pain and dieing.\n The difference seems to be professional opinions (doctor vs serviceman) and passive vs active deaths.\n Angel of Death type nurses and doctors are prosecuted for their active role in hastening a death most often. Others aren't for passivly letting someone die (although it could be argued that removal of life support is active).\n An abortion is universally an active proceedure...until we can find a way to remove the fetus in whole from the womb aka life support (then passively let it die).\n \n \nI believe your reduction of the woman's choices in this case to a category in order to compare it to abortion is intellectually dishonest.\n\n And I think the opposite. \n \n \nAll of the options I mentioned were qualitatively different. They require different levels of involvement by the mother and different amount of effort by the mother and may require expenses on the part of the mother, and each can be specifically chosen by the mother. They are distinct options. Even if you reduce those options down to the category of \"giving it away\", it would need to be qualified as to how it was given away as each of those provide different levels of care, and the impact to the child is different depending on which is chosen (allowing family or friends to care for it is generally preferable to the adoption system, adoption being what it is). This isn't comparable to abortion because the woman generally doesn't choose which abortion procedure is performed, there are different procedures doctors use in the appropriate situation, and all result in the death of the fetus. There is no question as to what happens to it afterwards.\n\n Then such things are 'temporary' much as the temporary pregnancy time.\n And, if she isn't keeping the child, at least it has a chance that it didn't have if it was killed via an abortion.\n \n \nAlso, you chose to ignore that a woman can have the born child temporarily taken care of by another, as in babysitting.\n\n Temporary seperation. As above, the pregnancy is also a short term situation.\n Like suicide, abortion is a permanent answer for a temporary problem.\n I acknowledge that the majority of pro-abortionist view abortion as a worst case scenario, something that few do willingly and easily (there are exceptions).\n \n \nYoung does not necessarily refer to chronological age, it is also a state of mind. It can also refer to one being inexperienced or childish.\n\n It was still an attack without a lot of refereence to actual knowledge of who I am. We have different opinions. I acknowledge that. That we each think we're right in out stances should also be a given.\n I could see those who wish to kill the unborn (child/fetus) as immature and ignorant also in relative comparison to my own history and knowledge.\n \n \nYour point?\n\n And yours?\n \n All sides can paint each other with a broad paint brush. \n Just as the pro-life side bandies about common rhetoric, so too does the pro-chose side. That's witnessed easily in these forums. You haven't previously refuted my assertation that many who champion the pro-abortion cause tend to be young. Just as I haven't refuted the notion that most anti-abortionist are...religious nutters.\n But, we can either wait for the youthful to age and see that some change their stances (they, of course, are replaced by a new batch of youth so the numbers don't change much) or hope that jesus freeeeks get raptured back to heaven...or get their numbers dwindled by continued errosion of religiosity (which actually ebbs and flows in society).\n \n \nAnd yet, financial issues are still important. A woman who can barely feed herself or perhaps her other children would be in a financial crisis. I do not believe that forcing her to continue her pregnancy by law is the correct thing to do, in addition to being oppressive.\n\n The child could then be removed from her care if she's unable to support it beyond birth...such things do happen at times. Or, a better support and education system built upon.\n One of the few (only?) things I heard from Kerry this past election in the US was on child care. Currently, canada is attempting to establish universal child care. I think it's worth looking into and have supported this idea for over a decade. But, getting republicans to agree will be hard and getting democrats to make it workable almost equally difficult.\n I simply see the handicap to many mothers in financial straits to be one of child care. I and my wife juggled out work schedules so as to afford us to never have to rely upon a 3rd party sitter or care.\n I recognise that that isn't something that a huge amount of people are capable of doing. But, child care is a huge issue for many. \n As to oppression of law in forcing someone to do something against their will.\n Males are forced to pay support if the mother 'chooses' to have the child. I many instances, even when the male is NOT found to be the biological father of the child, the court has forced him to pay...since it's 'in the best interest of the child'. Privacy issues and occasionally other rights have been tossed out.\n This can be viewed as unequal treatment and treating the male as a 2nd class citizen in regards to child care issues.\n Or how males have to register for selective service in the US and females don't. Sexual descrimination. ;)\n \n \n \nI'm not talking about what they are doing, I am talking about what they are proposing happen. Namely, requiring women continue their pregnancies by law. Slaveowners controlled their slaves reproductive lives through law as well. If a slave got pregnant a slaveowner could force them through an abortion, and if the slave didn't want to continue the pregnancy the owner could force them to continue it. Forcing women to continue pregnancies, by law, is putting them as second class citizens and giving what is growing inside them greater rights than the woman herself. I believe that is abhorrent.\n\n Ahhh, gottcha. However, while you see it as forced pregnancy, I simply see it as preserving a life that isn't capable of deciding to terminate itself.\n And, sorry, but people are forced to do many things by law.\n A silly tangent if I will, recently in Florida (miami?) the legislatures have decreed that you must not smell foul to be in a public library. I understand the reasons. Many say this is attacking homeless people who congregate there however, in my particular case, I have no sense of smell. This, I could stink and not even know it. Forcing me to be bathed for the pleasue of others is akin to making a blind man wear pretty clothing to please others. So, in this case, I'd be a 2nd class citizen merely doing something for others with no reward or benifit to myself.\n **Note, yes I do bath each day and try to smell good for others as a kindness and consideration to my fellow man but, do you not see the irony of me doing something for my entire life for others and if I were to fail to do so I could be penalized for it (no library that my tax money goes to support). While not as extreme as a pregnancy, it is all relative after all. I have no concept of smells, without another to verify for me, I know not if I stink or smell good. Pregnancy is a temporary issue. Most of the time it was initiated consentually.\n I choose to save a life.\n Just as others choose to not have me foul up the air.\n \n \nNo, it's a difference in how we view women. I can agree with your view of a fetus that it deserves protection just like any of us, yet still believe the woman (indeed, a man as well) has the right not to have anyone, even a person or a human 'being', attached to her body against her will and without her consent. You, however, believe women's ownership and right to her own organs and bodily processes does not exist or ends when she becomes pregnant.\n\n I understand you. However a lot of what society has is current protection of life and continued well being. I can understand the case many make on incest and rape since it's non consentual (or if we were raping wasp-people) and a right to not have anything growing on you. But, I still see a pregnancy as a natural consequence of a consential act. Unlike many, I support contraceptives (even if i was born and am a nominal catholic) and the morning after pill (which some see as a form of abortion). I also have varing shades of grey on the terms in which an abortion is performed. For example I definitly view a 3rd term abortion without threat to the mothers life as murder but find early 1st term abortion to be repugnant. For the US, if we had european style and consistant abortion practices as most europeans, I'd be content. Toss on over night stays for the operation and universal consent of a guardian (parent or judge) for minors, I could live with it ((I'd want more but I find those the least unreasonable)). \n But, these are beliefs.\n You've mentioned 'legal' in some instances. Would it change anything if it were illegal to have an abortion (or restricted abortions)? Or, will you still have your beliefs for what ever reason you hold?\n \n \nI believe it's undisputed that, whatever it is, it is alive and has human DNA. Even if it is the \"equivelant of an adult human\", I would believe a woman should be able to have an abortion.\n\n And, here, is where we'd severly disagree.\n As I demonstrated, a right to privacy (foundation for many on abortion issues) and a right to not have something growin in you is not universally protected. You place personal choice above the life and well being of another. I find this extremly morally repugnant. Others may agree or disagree.\n I can understand the stance many take stating that it's not the equivelant to another human life. To them, it's little more than tissue. But, someone who still states abortion should be allowed to be practiced even if the fetus/unborn/baby is considered equivelant to say a new born baby is no different to me than a bigot or racist who wouldn't bat an eye at the murder of another because it made life easier for them or brought some real or percieved benifit, even emotional.\n You belief (and it's yours to have) isn't a universally practiced one. That of absolute choice.\n If I'm misstating you, please feel free to clarify.\n \n \nAgreed, however pro-choice people also want to preserve life. If there was a way to remove the fetus from the woman without harming either do you think many abortions would be performed? The focus is the woman for pro-choice people. The focus is the fetus for pro-life people. Each disregards the rights of the focus of the other in favor of their own focus.\n\n Acknowledged. Thuis, it's why many pro-choice people focus on the woman over the (unliving) fetus. The differentiation as I stated above and something I, while disagreeing with, understand.\n Unlike other pro-lifers, I don't think most females have an abortion for purely inherant selfish reasons. Most pro-choicers do focus on life. Not just the fetus but that of the mother. Thus, you only get some die hards who'd force the mother to keep a baby that literally and severly threatened her life to carry to term. \n I do believe most of those whose side of the fense I find myself often on don't put their money where their mouth is, such as continued aid to mothers and children in need or via adoption.\n I'm nominally a conservative in most common regards however, I see the church established social services as lacking (care for widows and orphans for example and the needy) and the emergence of government support as a replacement in many situations. Thus, I can find myself disagreeing with pro-lifers attitudeds towards 'welfare' and the like.\n \n \n\"Fetus\" is the most neutral term, since it simply refers to a stage of development. \"Unborn\" is a PC term, like \"height challenged\". It amuses me to no end that the same people who spit with disgust on PC terms use this euphemism. The term also amuses me because I think \"undead corpse\" whenever I hear \"unborn infant\".\n\n And while unborn might be PC to you, it's an easy term for me. Currently fetus, while literally meaning a stage in developement, is used to mean 'mass of tissue not equivelant to a born person in classifications of life. Just as Child or baby is the pro-life term. Where you get unborn as PC is beyond me. If could be a euphamism for your area though. Such things happen but, it's either 'fetus' OR 'baby' where I'm at and in the numberous debates I've had on this subject. And you association with undead (zombie fan here) also amuses me. Fetus is not neutral any longer when dealing with what's in the womb, just as a swastika is no longer a neutral symbol in most western cultures. You may think so, but, you don't really see a lot from the perspective of the other side. You're the only one who's even made an issue out of it for over a decade ;). Seems like hair splitting or attempting to get me to use (owned) pro-choice verbage...and when I do, I often try to add the verbage of the prolifers (being PC and all...but, mostly attempting to find some actual debat rather than a simple shouting match).\n \n \nETA, yes it is correct. Few refute that sex can lead to pregnancy(A-<B); it can be prevented but not controlled. However, my contention is that pregnancy(B) -< childbirth(C) or pregnancy(B) -< abortion(C) while you say pregnancy(B) -< childbirth(C) alone. A -< B -< C, sex leads to pregnancy leads to childbirth, and the pro-life argument is if you consent to A you consent to C. If it was only that you consent to becoming pregnant but not to birthing a child abortion would still be allowed since you could stop from giving birth. This very debate is about that 3rd step.\n\n Understandable. Just as drinking a lot of alcohol doesn't mean you consent to dieing of alcohol poisoning, it's a possibility though and with information, most should be aware of the consequences of ones actions.\n Just like having unprotected sex doesn't mean you want to contract an STD. It's a possibility and people should make sure they know of the consequences of their actions.\n Consent has never really been much of a legal issue with having to deal with the consequences of your actions. \n \n Consent and choice seem to play a huge role in your beliefs. Legality topping it also from my take. \n \n \nLeaving your door open is not consent to being burglarized, nor is it consent to being killed in your bed. Also, regardless if you consent to them coming in your home, if they steal your stuff or plop down on the couch, eat your food and refuse to leave (and give you a punch in the gut every once in the while) you are perfectly able to kick them out or call the police to remove them. Consent to the original action in no way obligates you to allow them to remain in your house, let alone attached to your body. Only if there is a legal agreement can the intruder have a legal claim in staying in your house. Unless you suggest women (for only women can be pregnant) sign a legal document every time they have sex you have no basis for claiming the fetus has a legal right to be attached to her.\n\n Hehe, I wouldn't doubt some people would go that far with the signiture issue, after all some colleges had tried the signature for consent to have consentual sex so no one would be falsely accused of rape.\n But, I did state you invited rthe thief into your home, I'll correct that with KNOWN thief. Meaning you're aware of who they are and what they can do. Just as any female who lies with a male should know what he can do. If he says 'no baby, I won't get you pregnant, I promise' , she;s either gullible or he's a liar (assuming neither has been sterilized. There's no 100% guarantee that you won't get pregnant contrary to what many who support contraceptions often state just as there's not 100% security that you won't contract an STD along the way if he has one.\n \n \n \nTrue, but no law states you cannot change any of those consequences if you are able to. You are able to take marriage counseling if you do not want a divorce (even if it is a possible consequence of cheating), and you can have an abortion if you do not want to give birth.\n\n Sure, there are often easy (or not easy) ways to get out of most non-fatal situations. But, some resolve themselves naturally as would pregnancy. \n And, state laws on divorce vary a lot. But, it's near universal that if one wants a divorce (no fault divorce) it's granted regardless of what the other desires.\n The jist is that you still have consequences to deal with. I understand you state that abortion is a method for dealing with pregnancy consequences.\n \n \nYou seem to be under a misconception. The implication of what I said was \"Obviously Christians are not like Hitler even if Hitler espoused Christian beliefs, just as pro-choice people are not like slavers even if slavers espoused beliefs similar\". Evolution is not invalid nor is it oppressive even if Hitler believed it or tried to use it as justification for racial cleansing. Conversely, Stalin is compared to Hitler because their actions were similar (killings of mass numbers of people) even if their philosophies were polar opposites. In this way I compare pro-life people to slavers because their proposed actions mirror those of slavers.\n \n Really, you need to stop assuming, Zardoz.\n\n Understandable. You equate the pro-lifers as having control over a womans reproductive ograns like slavers (although a slaver could force her to concieve as well as abort, so it's true control rather than partial). I state that abortionists are such due to their absolute control over another life, the fetus/baby. Who's exerting more control? \n \n \n \n \nEvidence? Which ones?\n\n Are you looking for a case study?\n By it's very nature, sever to profound mental retardation can often preclude self awareness. All it takes is a little screwing up with the old brain and you're in little better shape than Terri Schiavo. I use 'some' because I don't want people to get the impression that I think it's prevalent. However, it does exist for demonstration in this debate. They are still protected under law, as are new born infants. This, of course is only a debate for those who use the 'they aren't people because they aren't self aware/sentient' line of reasoning.\n \n \nI don't believe that is necessarily so. Much of the pro-life argument is attempting to attack the reasoning behind pro-choice arguments. So, while the pro-life argument itself is a one-trick pony, you make up for it by trying to discover inconsistencies and create logic-traps for the pro-choice argument. So pro-choice people have to create consistent arguments across the board and know how to create it using sound logical principles while pro-life people have the easy job of attacking those arguments.\n\n It's not simply a one trick poney, it is a simple question, Do you believe the unborn/fetus/baby/whatever should have the same considerations towards life as the least capable member of society?\n Some, say no. Thus, we ask (or should ask) why do you think so.\n And take it from there.\n Most who say yes, often fall easily into the pro-life side with a few hitches as usual. And, pro-choice people DON'T have consistant arguements. They have varied. Quite obvious when they have varied reasons for agreeing with abortion/choise issues.\n Some pro-choice arguements are more persuasive than others. Some sound quite rational when devoid of any other mitigating circumstances. but, ration and logic don't easily apply. I could easily apply logic to a situation and call for the deaths of millions as the simplest rational end to my problem. It's a matter of viewpoint.\n \n \nIn what way have they failed it, and can you link to where it says newborns are not self-aware? \n\n Search Rouge Self Awareness. It's a common test for determining self awareness. I mistated previouly 3-4 years when it's commonly 20-24ish months before an infant can express the easiest to define traits of self awareness. http://ww2.lafayette.edu/~allanr/mirror.html\n If you're incapable of recognizing yourself...not much for self awareness.\n \n \nAlso, what is your point?\n\n This is another tangent and arises from debating multiple people. For you, it probably means nothing. But, as I've said, for some who wish to devine 'person' or 'being' from 'human' as is often done with some pro-abortionists, it matters since they say that the fetus isn't self aware so can be killed with no problems. Such logic fails when compared to how self aware primates are treated compared to non-self aware new borns and profoundly and severly mentally retarded people who have historically had to have special care and/or institutionalization. \n \n \nYes, says me. That's why I said \"should\", because I recognize you might get your way.\n\n ;)\n Hey, getting my way is fun.\n This also gets to something I've seen others discuss on subjective/objective morals. Many say that one should not forced their morality onto another. Thus, it's wrong for a nutter to oppose an abortion because that person is imposing their morality onto another. However, the reverse is also true. The pro-choicer is imposing their morality by stating that it's wrong to interfear and that it's morally right for them to passivly stand by as a life is taken.\n Both sides are guilty of imposing morality onto others or, expecting others to accept theirs. \n This may not apply to you but, it's also a reason some use to support abortion. You'll often hear, 'I would never get an abortion myself because of my morals but, I support others to do as they please.' It would be akin to an episode on Seinfeld, where Elains boy friends says he'd never be a thief as that opposes his religious views but, it's okay for Elain to be one (and he encourages her to do so).\n In the end, I'm as comfortable acting on my beliefs as you are yours. You can champion pro-choice rights and I'll do the opposite and seek to limit if not ban abortion practices.\n Preferably, we'll find a compromise or understanding or better yet, make the world a place where abortions simply aren't needed or desired.\n \n \nIn the pregnancy relationship, one participant necessarily has inferior rights. If there is one resource (the body) you and I cannot have equal rights to the use of it. If there is one hamburger, you and I cannot have equal rights to it as a whole. You may say \"cut it in half and it's equal\" but then I have the rights to half a hamburger instead. Also, the human body cannot be divided in that way. The waters are further muddied if you legally own the hamburger and I came along later and had to have it in order to live.\n\n Actually, that's not true. Resources can be ordered by the law to be shared. For example a home in a divorce or the fathers income in raising a child. You consider the body a resource. That's understandable. However, temporary use of such indivisable resources has been ordered by courts in the past.\n You're argueing for fairness and legal recourse at times. It's noce when they are equal but, they often aren't. \n Although I've seen short stories in science fiction that would pan out your seed of an idea and make the child indebted to the mother for the resourses it used to get to maturity...indenturedness.\n So, let's consider the little bugger a thief and have a legal decree to make him pay restitution for his theft...\n Hey, that should keep some loyalty to the mother. Especially if we have a debters prison the mom can throw him (her) into if they don't pay up.\n Also, how about the resources the fetus adds to the mother. All those chemical alterations. We can also weigh in any other benifits the mother might get from simply being pregnant (or detriments) such as how she's treated by others (or mistreated) and play around with the scales.\n Thus, we can have a child who'll either owe or be owed.\n Personally, I wouldn't want to be the fat little baby who took 24 hours of pain ladden labor to be born. Yep. I'd want to be the slick, handsome devil who was a breeze to pop out and made moms breasts look better (which is important in this image driven world) and wasn't even noticable while in the womb.\n \n \nThe fetus' use of the body denies the woman the use of the same resource within the body. They cannot have equal rights to the body because if the woman does not want her organs and life processes used and the fetus is using them, whose rights to the use of the body do you support? You cannot support them both equally. If you support the fetus' right to use her body then the fetus' rights are superior to the woman's rights to her own body. That makes her rights inferior to the fetus' rights. That makes her a second class citizen (after men and fetuses).\n\n Sureyou can support them equally. After all, the baby IS 1/2 her and is a part of her body. It's entitled to 25% of the whole at least...which is what it usually seems to use. ;)\n It even 'expands' her operations like a business add on. Giving her girth and added body mass. Sure, in the current westen world such things and baby fat are looked down upon but, in the realm of the world at large, some extra body tissue translated into survivability.\n A fetus doesn't just take, it provides a whole cocktail of chemical stimulants.\n So, why exactly can't I award part of the woman to control part of the woman? It isn't seperate until is comes out...right. :p\n It doesn't even get a legal name and identification number denoting seperate humaness until then. As I said, if the born child can be awarded resources from father or mother, we can award resources while it's in the womb too...IF you equate it to being equivelant to born status.\n *Note the role reversal here?\n \n Then you'll argue that she can do anything she wants with her 'own' body. Which I'll point out isn't universally true. If the FDA can ban silicon breast implants. And you can forbid doctors from legally removing a limb for no good reason or ban certain medical practics...you can ban abortions.\n If we woke up one day and forbid face lifts, we could do the same to abortions. They were previously illegal once.\n \n \n Gah. I say GAH! \n Is there any way to cut down post lengths?\n Or, can we simply pick a portion of the topic to debate?\n \n I doubt we'll change each others opinions on this any time soon and I don't have the time to devote to intensive arguements.\n \n \n *Sigh*\n Today is my sons 8th birthday (biological). I've been feeling all 'Raising Arizon'ish lately...he just ain't cute and cuddly anymore. I want a new one...might have to buy as that was our first and last natural one. I wonder what's on the market. I sure hope it isn't some Korean kid born with his heart on the outside...they'd have euthanized him.",

   "I'm going to presume that the story of Sun Hudson has not been discussed on this thread yet, this from FOXNews:\n \n Bush Criticized for End-of-Life Laws \n Friday, March 25, 2005\n By Jane Roh\n NEW YORK - While Americans were riveted by dramatic events unfolding in Pinellas Park, Fla., a five-month-old Houston baby took his last breath after a hospital let him die despite his mother's objections. \n \n Sun Hudson was born Sept. 25 with thanatophoric dysplasia, an incurable and fatal form of dwarfism. Doctors said his tiny lungs would never fully grow and that he would never breathe on his own.\n \n Hudson's mother, Wanda, put up a fight when doctors advised removing Sun from a respirator. She said she did not believe in sickness or death.\n \n But on March 15, a Texas law signed by then-Gov. George W. Bush in 1999 allowed the hospital to go ahead and take Sun off the respirator in defiance of Wanda Hudson's wishes.\n \n While the battle over Terri Schiavo has drawn dozens of outraged protesters to her Florida hospice, Sun's story made nary a bleep on the nation's radar. The few media outlets that picked up his story predictably drew parallels to the Schiavo case, and some experts have charged the president with hypocrisy.\n \n \"The Texas statute that Bush signed authorized the ending of the life, even over the parents' protest. And what he's doing here is saying, 'The parents are protesting. You shouldn't stop [treatment],'\" John Paris, a medical ethicist at Boston College, told Newsday.\n \n But some experts said the two cases are quite different.\n \n As is true of other state laws, Texas' Advance Directives Act of 1999 privileges the input of the patient's spouse over that of adult children, followed by the parents if there is no written directive.\n \n But ultimately, the decision to extend treatment is made by the doctors and hospital.\n \n \"I think her rights were violated,\" Mario Caballero, Wanda Hudson's attorney, told FOX News. \"These are decisions that the mother ought to make, and what really happened here is not an ethical issue.\"\n \n John Robertson, professor of bioethics at the University of Texas School of Law, said the Schiavo battle would have played out similarly had it taken place in Texas.\n \n \"The Schiavo case does not involve [the question of] if medical treatment is inappropriate,\" Robertson told FOXNews.com. \"It's just, is it a treatment she would have wanted? It's a case of what the patient would have decided.\"\n \n Doctors at Texas Children's Hospital unanimously agreed that Sun would never breathe on his own, was in pain and would eventually die from his condition. But Wanda Hudson objected, telling doctors that her baby was a gift from the sun and would not die.\n \n \"I was told what to do by Sun,\" she told a judge on Feb. 16. \"I don't understand all this legal stuff. But please give Sun time to allow Sun to create Sun.\"\n \n The doctors brought the case before a hospital ethics committee, which sided with them. But because Wanda Hudson disagreed, they were obligated to seek treatment for Sun elsewhere. Every facility they tried agreed with their prognosis.\n \n \"The provision in the statute indicates if doctors think treatment is futile and the relative doesn't want to take the patient off life support, then they can try to make provisions for care in another facility,\" Maxine Harrington, an associate professor at the Texas Wesleyan University School of Law, told FOXNews.com. \"They tried about 40 other facilities, and finally petitioned the court to authorize removal of life support.\"\n \n Harrington agreed that while the Schiavo case was different, her battle would have been as protracted in Texas as it has been in Florida.\n \n \"The laws aren't that different,\" she said.\n \n While Robertson conceded it was probably unfair to label Bush a hypocrite over the Advance Directives Act, the professor added that other contradictions had surfaced this week.\n \n Referring to Bush's backing of an unprecedented House maneuver to prolong Schiavo's life on Monday, he said: \"In 1999, as governor, he had more faith in our state court processes than he appeared last week to have in the Schiavo case.\"",

Disagree as you will but other such 'nonsenses' have and are perpetrated on people as decreed by the community or community leaders one finds themselves living in.\nOK, let me try to understand this. You propose to set up a dictatorship over women and their personal decisions regarding reproduction. Will women be completely powerless under this dictatorship? Will they be the only ones who bear the health and economic costs of being pregnant, of giving birth, of primary responsibility for the child? Is such a dictatorship a fair proposition?

But the basic costs would be the medical costs in medically monitoring a pregnancy and ensuring that it progresses satisfactorily, which can vary a great deal from woman to woman dependent upon the circumstances of that woman, her age, her economic status, her general health, her genetic predisposition for bearing children. Then, there are the potential additional costs of physical discomfort that pregnancy and giving birth presents to each individual woman. Should a woman be compensated for such pain and suffering? How should the costs of such pain and suffering be adjudicated?\n \n Beyond the physical costs of a pregnancy and giving birth, one must consider the economic ramifications. What if a woman, because of pregnancy, misses work and loses income as the result of an income. What about lost time during giving birth and recovery? What about the necessity for a mother and infant to have precious time to bond and form the parent/child ties? How could one deduce the compensation for those things? What, Zardoz, are your answers to all of those question?\n \nOne of the things I've found with dealing with some people is the 'Put Up or SHUT Up' method.

Until they can, why should those unfeeling, ruthless little people rule on the very personal decisions a woman makes regarding HER body, HER life, HER potential? Why?

   "How did I know you'd try to attach 'pain and suffering' to your list of demands. :p \n \n \n All things being equal (which pain and suffering isn't since we really can't empathise with you and your claims can be falsified) I can easily see bean counters weighing in the dollar amount.\n The question is, are people going to put up or shut up...\n \n \n But, yes, pregnant females can be dictated against. Just as ALL types can and as some ARE.\n Understand?\n It's what society does. To think that you can and should be able to go about as an island unto yourself is rediculous if that's what you're implying.\n \n Also, there is this little thing that some see as a dictatorship of LIFE and DEATH, (not comfort discomfort) that women have over the unborn/fetus/baby. If you says it's not a life, I understand that arguement, if you say it IS a life, you're a hypocrit.\n \n So, 9 months of subjective discomfort is often equivelant to a life.\n That's the message that's being received by pro-lifer types from pro-abortionists.\n Is that 'fair'?\n \n \n \nSadly, I fear that Hell will freeze over before anti-choicers can step out of their little black boxes, think outside the box, and give consideration to the true costs of pregnancy, giving birth and bearing primary responsibilities for parenthood.

Is this ability to oppress others in such a way truly rational?\n\n \n Saddly, I think you're right on hell freezing over. But, it's a good defense and also attempts to get the discussion on the right track for most. Rather than sit back yelling at people over rhetoric and doctrin, you attempt to engage them in responsive discourse.\n Simply start out, with a 'If you want me to keep a child I can't afford, what will you do to help me?' Or even 'I don't want a child, you take it and pay for it's costs.'\n Start there and see who jumps.\n Some will, but, I think it'd seperate the wheat from the chaff.\n \n \n But, even if they don't the reason why they would use their ability to alter the way things are done...is simply because they can. If enough of them seriously wanted change to abortion laws, it would eventually happen. Thus, the subject for debate shouldn't even deal much with abortion but, as you said, the reasons and causes on why a woman would even look into getting one.\n \n If these were looked at and addressed, there should be less abortions and more happy people. Win-win? Well, at least for the majority of people.\n \n As I said in a previous post. Child care is a huge issue. Already, in the US there is aid for giving birth and I've known many women who've used government assistance for it. It's once the booger is out that you have more financial issues.\n So, tighted up prenancy care.\n Address minor health concerns such as child wellness programs.\n And Deal with child day care and education.\n And most employers have maternity leave programs in one form or another.\n \n As I said, the liberals in Canada are currently trying to institute national daycare programs. If we could couple this with CPS over sites, we might even be able to stiffle cases of child abuse more.\n It's something to monitor to see if it works.\n \n \n If we're looking at purely financial issues and I'm allowed to be as utilitarian as others, then I'll take the unadulterated draconian method and prune society of the unintelligent and impoverished. Those without marketable or useful or entertaining skills will be aborted from society.\n After all, life itself is unimportant and we're talking about forcing others to share resources (like I have to when I pay out taxes to the poor people, that's me having my resources stolen and redistributed to another parasite) against their will. So, why not allow us to take it a step further than euthanasia and abortion and simply prune unproductive members of society.\n You can thus have your abortions since 'life' is unimportant. And we can allow you to starve without welfare programs or die of illness if you lack private health care. And if you steals from us, takes our resources, our prescious, we kills it! So says Golum!\n \n That's the attitude pro-lifers believe they're getting from pro-abortionists.\n \n So, when you get in an uproar about how you percieve others issueing decrees over you, that's what we see you doing...to the unborn.\n Pretty simple notion.\n \n \n And them little buggers are supposed to take care of you in your old age. Thus, the favor you do for your children is historically returned in your old age. Western society has moved away from this for the most part.\n \n \n Anyway, what would you rather us do?\n Work with you to address the causes for abortion.\n Or behave as we percieve you do...on steroids?\n \n We're extremist dontcha know.

   "All things being equal (which pain and suffering isn't since we really can't empathise with you and your claims can be falsified) I can easily see bean counters weighing in the dollar amount.\n The question is, are people going to put up or shut up...\nMy goodness, Zardoz, you certainly can ramble on and on. Are you on speed or something like that? Bean counters, really can't empathize with you, claims falsified, put up or shut. Quite a string of disparate ideas.\n \nBut, yes, pregnant females can be dictated against. Just as ALL types can and as some ARE.\n Understand?\n It's what society does. To think that you can and should be able to go about as an island unto yourself is rediculous if that's what you're implying.\nOh, and is that the American way? Are you a citizen of America, perchance, or perhaps some undistinguished emirate somewhere on the Sea of Arabia? You sound very like.\n \nAlso, there is this little thing that some see as a dictatorship of LIFE and DEATH, (not comfort discomfort) that women have over the unborn/fetus/baby. If you says it's not a life, I understand that arguement, if you say it IS a life, you're a hypocrit.\nWhat do you define as \"life,\" by the way? I think your argument is a tad obscure because, actually, you have not lain down very concrete parameters to discuss.\n \nSo, 9 months of subjective discomfort is often equivelant to a life.\n That's the message that's being received by pro-lifer types from pro-abortionists.\n Is that 'fair'?\n\"Subjective\" discomfort? Wooh! A very easy dismissal, a demeaning, a dimishing, a ridiculing of what a woman experiences in pregnancy and giving birth. Perhaps the experiences of women are not valid? Is that your flaccid excuse for your stance?\n \nSaddly, I think you're right on hell freezing over. But, it's a good defense and also attempts to get the discussion on the right track for most. Rather than sit back yelling at people over rhetoric and doctrin, you attempt to engage them in responsive discourse.\n Simply start out, with a 'If you want me to keep a child I can't afford, what will you do to help me?' Or even 'I don't want a child, you take it and pay for it's costs.'\n Start there and see who jumps.\n Some will, but, I think it'd seperate the wheat from the chaff.\nOh, heck, what the heck can't we boil down to a discussion of dollars and cents? It would be an interesting and very concrete way to look at the issue. I mean, the big things in life are dollars and cents aren't they? Isn't everything else in life secondary to the Almighty Buck?\n \nBut, even if they don't the reason why they would use their ability to alter the way things are done...is simply because they can. If enough of them seriously wanted change to abortion laws, it would eventually happen. Thus, the subject for debate shouldn't even deal much with abortion but, as you said, the reasons and causes on why a woman would even look into getting one.\nI don't care to know the reasons for choosing abortion. It's not my body involved, it's not my decision. Can you possibly tell me why I should tell another woman what to do with her body? One substantial reason that would make sense in America. Now, remember, we're not in your emirate, well, perhaps, you are, but I'm not and this is my turf and, well, women are considered human beings here, more or less.\n \nIf these were looked at and addressed, there should be less abortions and more happy people. Win-win? Well, at least for the majority of people.\nSee above.\n \nAs I said in a previous post. Child care is a huge issue. Already, in the US there is aid for giving birth and I've known many women who've used government assistance for it. It's once the booger is out that you have more financial issues.\n So, tighted up prenancy care.\n Address minor health concerns such as child wellness programs.\n And Deal with child day care and education.\n And most employers have maternity leave programs in one form or another.\nAnd, in which century will that occur?\n \nAs I said, the liberals in Canada are currently trying to institute national daycare programs. If we could couple this with CPS over sites, we might even be able to stiffle cases of child abuse more.\n It's something to monitor to see if it works.\nThe Canadian experiment should be very interesting to observe. My God! You're even making a wee bit of sense here in all your ramblings.\n \nIf we're looking at purely financial issues and I'm allowed to be as utilitarian as others, then I'll take the unadulterated draconian method and prune society of the unintelligent and impoverished. Those without marketable or useful or entertaining skills will be aborted from society.\n After all, life itself is unimportant and we're talking about forcing others to share resources (like I have to when I pay out taxes to the poor people, that's me having my resources stolen and redistributed to another parasite) against their will. So, why not allow us to take it a step further than euthanasia and abortion and simply prune unproductive members of society.\n You can thus have your abortions since 'life' is unimportant. And we can allow you to starve without welfare programs or die of illness if you lack private health care. And if you steals from us, takes our resources, our prescious, we kills it! So says Golum!\nOh, your tax dollars are going directly to poor people. Have you, perchance, followed a dollar or two of your precious tax dollars, watched it as it carefully made its way into, let's say, a poor guy named Joe, and have you then approached that poor guy named Joe and said, \"Hey, you wretched poor person, that's MY tax dollar that you've got your bloody hands on!\" Have you, Zardoz?\n \nThat's the attitude pro-lifers believe they're getting from pro-abortionists.\nOop, of which attitude do you speak? That seems to have disappeared in your rather confused wandering about in the countryside of debate.\n \nSo, when you get in an uproar about how you percieve others issueing decrees over you, that's what we see you doing...to the unborn.\n Pretty simple notion.\nWe? Who are the we of which you speak? Those of your emirate who are allowed to vote and have opinions?\n \nAnd them little buggers are supposed to take care of you in your old age. Thus, the favor you do for your children is historically returned in your old age. Western society has moved away from this for the most part.\nWhy should the little buggers be supposed to take care of me in my old age? Many of them choose not to, you know, many of them do not have the means to do so, that's why we have Social Security in the United States.\n \nAnyway, what would you rather us do?\n Work with you to address the causes for abortion.\n Or behave as we percieve you do...on steroids?\nAgain, who is this mythical \"We\" of whom you speak?\n \nWe're extremist dontcha know. Says so on the back of pro-choice literature. ;)\nAnd, as is so typical of extremists, a tad muddled in the thinking and reasoning process.",

She was part of a very strictly Roman Catholic family and it would have been unacceptable to her family for her to turn up pregnant. She was desperate and chose a dangerous and unsafe way out. Again, given the very few people I knew then, not an insignificant occurrence. A friend of mine in later life told of one of her friends literally dying in an alley as the result of an illegal, unsafe abortion. Both my cousin and my friend are very, very, very angry that this occurred to people they loved and they will never forgive the stupidity and evil of those times.\n \n I became a feminist because of those events and many other and saw some major changes to the good occur in our culture. Abortion became safe, legal and accessible. Also, because abortion was available, unwed women who chose not to have abortions were no longer shamed and stigmatized to the same extent that they had suffered those abuses before. That women were no longer shamed is one of the things I am proudest of in my involvement with Feminism.\n \n Although, I fear that in some backward, radically rightwing religious areas women are still shamed and stigmatized for becoming pregnant outside of marriage. There is still work to be done.",

   "My goodness, Zardoz, you certainly can ramble on and on. Are you on speed or something like that? Bean counters, really can't empathize with you, claims falsified, put up or shut. Quite a string of disparate ideas.\n\n Just a list of ideas. Much like how you toss out garbage without extensive thought or understanding on it. All things are done by bean counters. Insurance. Business. 911 compensation. It's all about numbers. Falsified claims...just like insurance fraud which happens, you can get a female faking a claim of pain and suffering (happens by many in common law suits and claims) to get more compensation. None are disparate ideas but responses to your claims. If you don't want many answers don't raise many points.\n \n \nOh, and is that the American way? Are you a citizen of America, perchance, or perhaps some undistinguished emirate somewhere on the Sea of Arabia? You sound very like.\n\n Yep. In America. Look at all the rights americans have. Not a SINGLE one is absolute. Speech? Don't yell \"fire!\" in a theater. Religion? Don't try human sacrifice (even of a volunteer) and animal sacrifice is pretty limited or try to restict medical care for your child based on your religious beliefs, a court can over rule that.\n Welfare and taxes is redistribution of wealth or, theft from one.\n Right to life? = Death penalty.\n Vote? = Not if you're a convicted fellon.\n All 'rights' have limitations. Except for this 'right' to have an abortion it seems. Some have the notion that it should be unrestricted.\n Privacy, better not be breaking the law.\n I've even given examples where the law can and has forced people to do something agaisnt their will 'for the greater good'. Forcing a woman to carry a baby to term isn't an alien concept. It happened before. Some reevaluated that idea and decided against it. If a male unrelated to an infant can be ordered by law to continue child support because 'it's in the best interest of the child' then other individuals can be imposed upon. We have precident.\n \n \nWhat do you define as \"life,\" by the way? I think your argument is a tad obscure because, actually, you have not lain down very concrete parameters to discuss.\n\n Sure, even though I wasn't the 1st to bring it up. Life for me translates as something that's growing and motive. Standard dictionary response if you want to look it up. Pro-abortionist sometimes try to define what living is and who's alive and who's not.\n \n \n\"Subjective\" discomfort? Wooh! A very easy dismissal, a demeaning, a dimishing, a ridiculing of what a woman experiences in pregnancy and giving birth. Perhaps the experiences of women are not valid? Is that your flaccid excuse for your stance?\n\n Perhaps you'd best once again get off your high horse. It has already been determined that such an event as a pregnancy IS subjective when it comes to discomfort. You're argueing just to argue and you have no substance. That or, you're tyring to speak for al women which last time around you seemed to impy you wern't doing.\n How should I award a person who has 24hrs of pain ridden labor and a complicated pregnancy compared to one who can litterally pop a baby out without breaking a sweat?\n Should the person who says she has pain get some extra cash? What about the one who doesn't have 'pain and suffering?'\n Can I fake discomfort (I do it on a daily basis) to get some extra cash?\n Please, is is subjective. Accept it and let's move on. \n \n \nOh, heck, what the heck can't we boil down to a discussion of dollars and cents? It would be an interesting and very concrete way to look at the issue. I mean, the big things in life are dollars and cents aren't they? Isn't everything else in life secondary to the Almighty Buck?\n\n You're too funny. For starters, let's get to already covered subjects. \n You mentioned pregnancy and cost.\n I'll counter with that and say, 'in the US (where you and I live) Medicaid covers 100% of it. You can't be turned away from a hospital if you have a medical issue (insurance or not). So, those who can't afford to have the child don't have to pay. Wonderful redistribution of wealth. I can accept that. Tax dollars already set aside for this issue and a developed system already in place. I've said before, I've had friends who've had 100% covered births.\n After that, if you don't want to or can't keep the child, the state will OR an adoptive parent. Still no extra cost to the mother. If she wants to keep it but can't afford to, other welfare programs exist.\n Now, we have the advancement issue as I mentioned. Child care. I proposed national child care and even gave Canada as a place to watch to see if it's feasable.\n After and during that, there's the issue of trying to make the mother (should she keep the child) self suffecient. Government programs already exist for that. I'd say they aren't the best and this can be looked at further. And, while SOME formes of state assisted child care is in place (My sister, unwed mother of 5 has used state assisted child care programs) it could be strengthened.\n Bottom line is, there's universally a way to get coverage for the issue of pregnancy. Pro-abortionists don't want you to think so though it seems.\n You mentioned missed work. Maternity leave and family time is often feasable for some. This could be expanded upon.\n You make it sound as if nothing is there to help the needy out.\n I acknowledge that there needs to be some topics addessed but that financial assistnace is readily avbailable and has been instituted for a long time. if republicans are cutting programs, how has this impacted the problems. Is there an alternative in place or are people going without?\n \n Sounds to me like you're tossing out random phamplet statements thinking that no one has an answer to justify your financial reasons to not carry a child to term.\n Ask for the money, I point and say it's there. If it's not enough, let's look into the matter. You then want to tag on pain and suffering. Well, life is pain and suffering. I undergo sever anguish when I have to get off my butt and go to work and leave the comform of my own home. I should demand something extra then. No?\n If such a thing exist and is compensatable, that what you have bean counters for to determin who gets what.\n \n \nI don't care to know the reasons for choosing abortion. It's not my body involved, it's not my decision.\n\n Then I don't care if someone kills or rapes you. 'It's not my body.' Right? \n Does that sound like the most insensitive thing you've ever heard? I think it is and would look extremly down upon any one who made that statement to me OR to you. So, why can you freely make that comment and I can't?\n I'm curious as to your reaction to me if I were to say 'I don't care if racists kill off all blacks, I'm not black so I don't care.' \n For me, the ONLY reason to justifiably get an abortion would start with the notion that you don't think of the fetus as equivelant (living/person/being/whatever) to another human. If you were to have said that, \"I don't care if they remove a limp of 'unliving' flesh from their bodues, it is their body.' I would have less to be upset about your attitudes than when you said what you did.\n It's all how you view the fetus/unborn/baby in the womb.\n If you think it's equivelant to a living born baby, then you should care.\n If not, well, then we can agree to disagree.\n \n \nCan you possibly tell me why I should tell another woman what to do with her body? One substantial reason that would make sense in America.\n\n Simply because we tell people what to do on a daily basis for many other things. If a woman comes and says keeping my born child is a burden on me financially, I should be allowed to kill it. Should she be allowed to do so?\n If finances are a reason for abortion, I've pointed out already existing government programs that aleviate that burden.\n We tell women that they can't have silicon implants even if they want them (this may change again) as they were banned by the FDA as unsafe due to leakages. So, even if a woman wanted a potentially harmful thing done to her here, she can't get it done. It is her body right?\n \n \nNow, remember, we're not in your emirate, well, perhaps, you are, but I'm not and this is my turf and, well, women are considered human beings here, more or less.\n\n Have you EVER delt with the law? In the US?\n Yes, a woman is a human being. Currently, a fetus is one too in some situations (reread my arguement on fetal homicide laws). RvW is predicated on 1st term fetuses not really being 'human' and not protected by the law.\n This is based on 30+ year old knowledge of fetus development.\n Often, it's mentioned that historically, a fetus could be aborted before quickening (moving in the womb on it's own). So, even ancient abortion practices and most current european laws on the matter, have a defining point when a fetus was deemed worthy of protection and not. America doesn't seem to be there at the moment. But, then again, we execute minors and the mentally retarded. While I'd like to think America is well off, maybe we do have a ways to go.\n \n \nAnd, in which century will that occur?\n\n I wish it would be soon.\n \n \nThe Canadian experiment should be very interesting to observe. My God! You're even making a wee bit of sense here in all your ramblings.\n\n Yes, I do ramble on. I think I've apologized for that before. I don't even like these debates as usually they're nothing more than shouting matches. I don't have the physical time to devote to constant back and forth exhanges so have to cram a lot into one setting often haveing to deal with multiple people.\n While I'd like for such a thing as national child care and heath issues to not be an issue, i think that we might have to look more into it. I'd love to see Canada implement a system that worked. Not only affordable but effective.\n I think this very subject would make for a good debate on a seperate thread. Where we could discuss the merits of national child care.\n It the only thing I heard out of Senator Kerrys mouth that made me smile and agree when he mentioned it during last election and I'll personally be watching the Canadian method when possible (it's my job so, I'll be spending some time monitoring it whether I want to or not).\n \n \nOh, your tax dollars are going directly to poor people. Have you, perchance, followed a dollar or two of your precious tax dollars, watched it as it carefully made its way into, let's say, a poor guy named Joe, and have you then approached that poor guy named Joe and said, \"Hey, you wretched poor person, that's MY tax dollar that you've got your bloody hands on!\" Have you, Zardoz?\n\n I don't have to watch each individual dollar to know how it's divided among the various programs.\n Many people have asked for a line item type of allocation for their own tax dollars in the past. Notably anti-military people who don't want their tax dollars going to support the 'military industrial complex' or what ever. If such a thing were to happen where each tax payer got to say where their dollar went, how many would think, 'I donate enough to charity as it is, I'm not donating to welfare'? I know there was an old fart (70-80yrs old) who was going about the neighborhood trying to get a petition signed to NOT open another needed school here simply because he didn't want his taxes to raise to maintain it. I told him to shove it...and all of my children are in private education so my taxes to pay for public schooling aren't being returned but, I see a need for that school and am willing to pay for it.\n But, it is simple that the government takes by force and redistributes to others portions of our tax monies against our wills. Otherwise, it'd be easy to simply say I choose not to be taxed and I don't want a portion of MY tax monies to go towards 'X' government program.\n \n \nThose of your emirate who are allowed to vote and have opinions?\n\n Yes the emirate of the US. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \nWhy should the little buggers be supposed to take care of me in my old age? Many of them choose not to, you know, many of them do not have the means to do so, that's why we have Social Security in the United States.\n Again, who is this mythical \"We\" of whom you speak?\n\n Social security is a relatively new thing in america and the world. Through out history, it was a given that you'd support your family. Several thousand years of human behavior there. Somehow, we in our enlightened state noticed the errosion of the traditional church in tending for the needy of the society and have instituted government in it's place. I also have to laugh if you think SS will be enough to do what is needed through out the rest of americas existance. maybe you'll be happy with SS and how your children deal with you in your old age. I know I'm currently happy with my plan and how things are coming to pass. if I get some SS, great.\n But, the 'WHY' is called social contract. We all participate in it in one form or another. and, if you children don't have the means to assist you, either they made some bad choices or you didn't instill in them the notion of caring for their own family. I'm not saying they should donate a kidney but they certainly shouldn't let thier old mum be tossed out into the street.\n \n \nAnd, as is so typical of extremists, a tad muddled in the thinking and reasoning process.\n\n At least I don't come off as a shrill bitch ;). And there hasn't been a fault in my reasoning no matter what you try to claim. A lot of the times here, you seem to desire to interject snide comments into your posts. I'm cool with that but, you don't seem to be willing to discourse. Is it because it might challenge your beliefs?\n That an anti-abortionist would desire to address the reason why many say they have an abortion?\n \n \n \n \n Just yesterday I was talking to a former minister who said that he agreed that the poor and needy and unwed mothers needed assitance. He thought the 'church' should provide assistance but, agreed that the church was failing in this regard. Thus, it is justifiable to seek the government to fill the gaps.\n \n This is the put up or shut up mentality.\n \n Simply ask a pro-lifer what are they going to do to meet the needs that many women find themselves in.\n If they don't have an answer or are willing to work with you then there isn't a single reason to waste your breath further unless you simply like to verbally abuse and be abused.\n \n \n \n As for your later comments on feminism. Universally getting women to feel and BE empowered should be the goal.\n I have a slightly different take though.\n I wouldn't say it's empowering to allow a woman to get an abortion to 'avoid' criticism and put downs for being an unwed mother. I'd say it's empowering them to make their own choices and not care about others comments.\n All you've done is replace 'unwed mother' with 'abortionists'. Some see this as a differnence and wouldn't redicule her for the abortion as they would an unwed pregnancy but that some would be few and far inbetween.\n Most people who would ridicule her for an unwed pregnancy would do the same or worse for an abortion. No change.\n And those who wouldn't put her down for an abortion wouldn't do the same for an unwed pregnancy. No change.\n So, what have you accomplished?\n Do you really think it's abortion rights that led to empowerment or simply women who refuse to be 2nd class citizens in ALL OTHER catagories?\n What's more important; equal pay for equal work or being allowed to get an abortion? Different answers by different people.\n \n Society cares less and less about unwed mothers as it is. It's not something to glorify but it certainly isn't treated as the worst you can do like it was decades ago. Faulty reasoning and justification.\n \n My little sister is on her 5th and is unwed and has been. There isn't a lot of stigmata attached to that fact for her.\n \n I have teen daughters. Esteem and empowerment for them is just as taught and instilled as you'd like it. They don't have to do something to avoid redicule to feel good about themselves. They don't have any desire to 'please a man' just to get a feeling of self worth. \n I'd have several of the traits of a feminist. Not one of those pandering males who was raised by an over bearing mother or man hater or someone who's faking sympathies to be around stronger women but, as someone who believes that equal treatment for all should be a given. Thus, I find it odd when people equate pregnancy to being enslaved.\n And recall, I did take my wifes last name upon marriage (I mentined in this thread or another similar to it).",

When you become married, that is a legally binding decision and your SO becomes your closest kin.\n \n \n\n A child didn't chose the parent. So, while the child possess less legal rights in some situations, I would take it that the child has a right to life unless it stated other wise. Currently, children are incapable of making an informed descision in certain matters.\n\n \n Actually, there is no right to life in the Constitution. You're right, parents do make decisions for their children. This does not always extend to removing them from life-support, but that is different than if they existed within and were living off of the woman's body. Machines have no rights to violate, while the woman does. The woman is the most important participant in the pregnancy relationship, imo. Her rights are paramount.\n \n \n\n Some would say it did. And many have argued that point.\n Had she been classified as such, most law makers would have issued protections. Over time, our thinking on such issues has gone back and forth.\n\n \n I believe those people would be wrong. Whether or not the other is a \"person\" or a human 'being' is not considered when killing is justified. In self-defense, the burglar isn't judged to be less than human or less of a person.\n \n None of your examples showed the one being killed was considered less than a person. You don't have to be considered a non-person to be legally killed.\n \n \n\n Then such things are 'temporary' much as the temporary pregnancy time.\n And, if she isn't keeping the child, at least it has a chance that it didn't have if it was killed via an abortion.\n\n \n lol, Zardoz, don't insult both my and your intelligence. Not only does this have nothing to do with me stating that a woman has various options with a born child, but a woman with a born child chooses to have another care for it. In your case, you want to remove any personal choice on the part of the woman. She has no choice, if you have your way, whether or not she shares her bodily processes and energy with another. A woman who is pregnant does not have the option to put the fetus down, temporarily or otherwise. A woman with a born child has many more options.\n \n Yes, with adoption and not keeping the child it has a chance it doesn't have with abortion, but women should not be legally required to remain pregnant for anyone else. Not for the future child, not for a couple wanting to adopt, and not for your morals.\n \n \n\n Temporary seperation. As above, the pregnancy is also a short term situation.\n Like suicide, abortion is a permanent answer for a temporary problem.\n I acknowledge that the majority of pro-abortionist view abortion as a worst case scenario, something that few do willingly and easily (there are exceptions).\n \n\n \n You're kidding. You're comparing 9 months of hormonal imbalances and stress on the body with leaving a child with a babysitter? Yes, both are temporary but the woman choose to leave the child with another and you wish the woman to have no choice during the pregnancy.\n \n \n\n The child could then be removed from her care if she's unable to support it beyond birth...such things do happen at times. Or, a better support and education system built upon.\n\n \n However, even the pregnancy can cost a woman in this situation. She may not be able to work as much or at all, she may not be able to care for herself or her existing children while she is pregnant. Financial issues are important and are not solved by saying \"the child can be removed from her care if she's unable to support it\". Whatever you personally went through is irrelevant, there are as many different experiences, and as many different conditions in pregnancy as there are women to experience them.\n \n \n\n As to oppression of law in forcing someone to do something against their will.\n Males are forced to pay support if the mother 'chooses' to have the child. I many instances, even when the male is NOT found to be the biological father of the child, the court has forced him to pay...since it's 'in the best interest of the child'. Privacy issues and occasionally other rights have been tossed out.\n\n \n Agreed, and I very strongly disagree with this. I believe a man should be able to \"abort\" his rights and responsibilities in the same time frame as a woman can abort the fetus. No-one should be forced to be a parent, and no woman should be forced to bear a child.\n \n The law treats men and women differently and I believe this is wrong. They are mostly hold-over and antiquated notions of the place of men and women in families.\n \n \n\n Ahhh, gottcha. However, while you see it as forced pregnancy, I simply see it as preserving a life that isn't capable of deciding to terminate itself.\n\n \n Preserving life is fine, I support that. Supporting life by violating another's rights? No, that's fascism. Supporting a thing but ignoring the consequences of that action is not responsible. Notice the role change? ;)\n \n The consequence is that women will be forced to remain pregnant against their will and without their consent.\n \n \n\n And, sorry, but people are forced to do many things by law.\n\n \n Your argument is \"rights are limited in other ways so we should limit the right to ones own body\"? How does that follow? In no situation I can think of is the energy and processes one's own body produces forced to support another person, even if they would die without it.\n \n \n\n I understand you. However a lot of what society has is current protection of life and continued well being.\n\n \n What of the woman's well-being? Why is that continually disregarded? Why is the fetus more important?\n \n \n\n But, I still see a pregnancy as a natural consequence of a consential act.\n\n \n It is a possible consequence to a consensual act. This is immaterial. There is no law requiring anyone to endure a certain consequence if they can change it.\n \n \n You've mentioned 'legal' in some instances. Would it change anything if it were illegal to have an abortion (or restricted abortions)? Or, will you still have your beliefs for what ever reason you hold?\n\n \n No.\n \n \n\n And, here, is where we'd severly disagree.\n As I demonstrated, a right to privacy (foundation for many on abortion issues) and a right to not have something growin in you is not universally protected.\n\n \n When is something legally allowed to grow inside you against your will? Pregnancy is not a valid example in this case.\n \n \n\n You place personal choice above the life and well being of another. I find this extremly morally repugnant. Others may agree or disagree.\n\n \n Then we are on equal footing. I find pro-lifers to be morally repugnant.\n \n Freedom can be more important than even life.\n \n \n\n I can understand the stance many take stating that it's not the equivelant to another human life. To them, it's little more than tissue. But, someone who still states abortion should be allowed to be practiced even if the fetus/unborn/baby is considered equivelant to say a new born baby is no different to me than a bigot or racist who wouldn't bat an eye at the murder of another because it made life easier for them or brought some real or percieved benifit, even emotional.\n You belief (and it's yours to have) isn't a universally practiced one. That of absolute choice.\n If I'm misstating you, please feel free to clarify.\n\n \n A fetus is not the equivalent to a newborn. Nowhere did I state this. I said even if the fetus is considered a person. The circumstances of pregnancy are unique and within those circumstances abortion is justified to me even if the fetus is considered a person under the law. What you stated here does not follow. Perhaps if you clarify?\n \n \n\n Acknowledged. Thuis, it's why many pro-choice people focus on the woman over the (unliving) fetus. The differentiation as I stated above and something I, while disagreeing with, understand.\n\n \n I never said the fetus was unliving. Please don't make assumptions, Zardoz.\n \n \n\n Where you get unborn as PC is beyond me.\n\n \n It is an overly verbose way of describing something in order to make it more palatable or pleasant. It's PC.\n \n \n\n If could be a euphamism for your area though.\n\n \n In my area? No, it's a euphemism wherever you use it.\n \n I honestly couldn't care less what you use, but it really does amuse me.\n \n \n\n Just like having unprotected sex doesn't mean you want to contract an STD. It's a possibility and people should make sure they know of the consequences of their actions.\n Consent has never really been much of a legal issue with having to deal with the consequences of your actions. \n\n \n Legal consent is required for the claim that the fetus has a legal right to the woman's body (any part) to have any basis. I agree that people should make responsible decisions and take into consideration the consequences of their action. Legally enforcing moral responsibility is fascist, however. Pregnancy should not be used as punishment for irresponsible behavior, it should not be a learning tool or a beating stick or a punishment. To do so denigrates women in general and mothers in particular.\n \n \n\n But, I did state you invited rthe thief into your home, I'll correct that with KNOWN thief. Meaning you're aware of who they are and what they can do.\n\n \n This is immaterial. Don't insult my or your intelligence. Even if you invite a known thief into your house you have every right to expel him if he steals your stuff.\n \n \n\n Just as any female who lies with a male should know what he can do. If he says 'no baby, I won't get you pregnant, I promise' , she;s either gullible or he's a liar (assuming neither has been sterilized. There's no 100% guarantee that you won't get pregnant contrary to what many who support contraceptions often state just as there's not 100% security that you won't contract an STD along the way if he has one.\n\n \n Agreed, there is no 100% security against these things. However, even as you said:  Just like having unprotected sex doesn't mean you want to contract an STD \n \n \n\n Understandable. You equate the pro-lifers as having control over a womans reproductive ograns like slavers (although a slaver could force her to concieve as well as abort, so it's true control rather than partial). I state that abortionists are such due to their absolute control over another life, the fetus/baby. Who's exerting more control? \n\n \n Agreed, who is exerting more control? The woman wants control over herself, while pro-lifers want control over another. Who is more morally corrupt?\n \n Yes, it is herself, for even you say: It isn't seperate until is comes out.\n \n \n \n\n It's not simply a one trick poney, it is a simple question, Do you believe the unborn/fetus/baby/whatever should have the same considerations towards life as the least capable member of society?\n\n \n Yes, I do. A fetus should have the same consideration. No-one, not even the least capable member of society, should have the legal right to live attached to anyone else against that other's will and without that other's consent.\n \n \n\n ;)\n Hey, getting my way is fun.\n This also gets to something I've seen others discuss on subjective/objective morals. Many say that one should not forced their morality onto another. Thus, it's wrong for a nutter to oppose an abortion because that person is imposing their morality onto another. However, the reverse is also true. The pro-choicer is imposing their morality by stating that it's wrong to interfear and that it's morally right for them to passivly stand by as a life is taken.\n\n \n It is not forcing my morality upon you to say that you cannot interfere in my life even if your morals allow it, not exactly. However, it is forcing my morality on you if I say that I can interfere with yours because of my morals.\n \n This is an empty argument.\n \n \n\n Actually, that's not true. Resources can be ordered by the law to be shared.\n\n \n However, a finite or consumable resource cannot be used by two different people at the same time. Your examples are not comparable.\n \n You're proposed course of action of indenturing the baby is disregarded as nonsensical.\n \n \n\n Sureyou can support them equally. After all, the baby IS 1/2 her and is a part of her body. It's entitled to 25% of the whole at least...which is what it usually seems to use. ;)\n\n \n How was that number come to?\n \n Entitled?! rofl! No-one is entitled to the use of your organs and the energy your body produces. Your labor may be used against your will, but the energy that your body produces is being used by yourself.\n \n \n\n It even 'expands' her operations like a business add on. Giving her girth and added body mass. Sure, in the current westen world such things and baby fat are looked down upon but, in the realm of the world at large, some extra body tissue translated into survivability.\n\n \n So you're going to legally force pregnancy because... extra body tissue translates into survivability?\n \n \n \n\n A fetus doesn't just take, it provides a whole cocktail of chemical stimulants.\n So, why exactly can't I award part of the woman to control part of the woman? It isn't seperate until is comes out...right. :p\n It doesn't even get a legal name and identification number denoting seperate humaness until then. As I said, if the born child can be awarded resources from father or mother, we can award resources while it's in the womb too...IF you equate it to being equivelant to born status.\n \n\n \n This role-reversal destroys the pro-life argument. If the fetus is a part of the mother and has no identity separate from her then what basis do you have for protecting it under the law? What are you protecting? An organ? There is nothing to protect because there is nothing inside the woman but more of the woman. \n \n You are right, it is not a legal citizen until it comes out. Then it receives the full protection of the law :) Why can you award resources? There no individual to award them to!\n \n \n\n Then you'll argue that she can do anything she wants with her 'own' body. Which I'll point out isn't universally true. If the FDA can ban silicon breast implants. And you can forbid doctors from legally removing a limb for no good reason or ban certain medical practics...you can ban abortions.\n If we woke up one day and forbid face lifts, we could do the same to abortions. They were previously illegal once.\n\n \n There is no desire to \"do anything she wants with her 'own' body \" (why is own in quotes? Is it not her own?). The desire is to not have things done or to happen to ones body that one does not want.",

   "Sorry it took me so long, Zardoz, I have little time at the moment.\n \n You're the second person to want smaller posts :-\\ I suppose that's better for me as well, given that I don't have much time myself. I'm something of an ego-maniac so I do go on ;) I'll thank you in advance for the site, I always look for opportunities to expand my education.\n \n I won't respond to irrelevant points.\n\n No problem, I'm in the same position. As an attempt to limit the length of the post, I'll respond to some points. If you think others need addressing, please chim in. Might need a new thread just to address individual issues.\n \n \n \n \nOf course this is true. Nor should they, since morality changes from person to person. The law exists to allow us to live together, not to make us moral people.\nI would posit that laws should reflect established morality. However, I acknowledge that morality, over recent time, has gone from the perspective of objective (all encompasing) to subjective (up to individual interpretation).\n Either way, there is no law that says we shouldn't pursue our own morality. Thus, so long as we're breaking no other law, we each can push our own agendas. If widely accepted, they can be established as law...or later repealed.\n \n \nlol, Zardoz. Actually, it's fairly explicit, not implicit. Our law provides that when you cannot make decisions on your own your closest kin makes those decisions for you. When you become married, that is a legally binding decision and your SO becomes your closest kin.\n\n One of the reasons I support homosexual unions/ marriages.\n \n \n \nI believe those people would be wrong. Whether or not the other is a \"person\" or a human 'being' is not considered when killing is justified. In self-defense, the burglar isn't judged to be less than human or less of a person.\n\n However, there are riles to follow when determining when you can end another life. Self defense being one (and even that has restrictions). Not a simple 'because'. It's why I can suppport the ending of a pregnancy when it risks the mothers life.\n \n \nNone of your examples showed the one being killed was considered less than a person. You don't have to be considered a non-person to be legally killed.\n\n Exactly, legally. Abortion could be considered legally killing someone? No? If so, why should it be allowed and no other forms of legal killing?\n Death penalty has due process where the defendant has the chance to defend themselves. Most forms of legal killing are based upon the to be killed having done something to warrant the death such as break the law. Is their a law against being born?\n \n \nYes, with adoption and not keeping the child it has a chance it doesn't have with abortion, but women should not be legally required to remain pregnant for anyone else. Not for the future child, not for a couple wanting to adopt, and not for your morals.\n\n Still with the 'should not.' Just as with me, this is a belief and not an absolute. I disagree and think the woman should. Particularly in the cases where the pregnancy arose out of consentual sex and doesn't threaten the mothers life.\n \n \nYou're kidding. You're comparing 9 months of hormonal imbalances and stress on the body with leaving a child with a babysitter? Yes, both are temporary but the woman choose to leave the child with another and you wish the woman to have no choice during the pregnancy.\n\n Choice is relative. There are many things you chose to do that you later can't 'unchose'. I consider pregnancy one of them.\n \n \nFinancial issues are important and are not solved by saying \"the child can be removed from her care if she's unable to support it\". Whatever you personally went through is irrelevant, there are as many different experiences, and as many different conditions in pregnancy as there are women to experience them.\n\n I would have no problem with insurance or government stepping in to assist a woman who was proven to be unable to work due to pregnancy financially.\n I know many conservatives wouldn't though. Thus, my 'Put up or shut up' defense for your side.\n \n \nAgreed, and I very strongly disagree with this. I believe a man should be able to \"abort\" his rights and responsibilities in the same time frame as a woman can abort the fetus. No-one should be forced to be a parent, and no woman should be forced to bear a child.\n\n This is a statement I can agree with. It makes it equal rights for the sexes in regards to parental choices. My very religious netter wife states this often.\n \n \nPreserving life is fine, I support that. Supporting life by violating another's rights? No, that's fascism. Supporting a thing but ignoring the consequences of that action is not responsible. Notice the role change? ;)\n\n :p\n From my view, rights are often arrainged in order of importance. Others may disagree.\n \n \nThe consequence is that women will be forced to remain pregnant against their will and without their consent.\n\n Initial consent is implied in consentual sex. Or, can we state saying that people aren't capable of giving consent when their hormonal levels are unbalanced due to lustful desires??? ;)\n \n \nYour argument is \"rights are limited in other ways so we should limit the right to ones own body\"? How does that follow? In no situation I can think of is the energy and processes one's own body produces forced to support another person, even if they would die without it.\n\n Hair splitting on what is energy of ones own body and labor of one.\n I see little to differ on when it comes to resoursces of ones own body and taxation. This resource of ones own body seems to be a new thing and often deals with abortion issues only, unless you have another expample.\n \n \nWhat of the woman's well-being? Why is that continually disregarded? Why is the fetus more important?\n\n Can we define 'well being'? Or is this subjective?\n \n \nThen we are on equal footing. I find pro-lifers to be morally repugnant.\n ;)\n Qustion is, are you willing (or do) to act on this belief? Via voting or other awareness issues. Or, simply a voice on the net?\n \n \nFreedom can be more important than even life.\n\n Not to the persons life you'r ending to achieve that 'freedom'.\n Otherwise, this seems like a decent reason to kill off the impoverished and expunge those who provide nothing to society. Somewhere along the lines, they are imposing on my and your freedoms. Once again, it's can. Not an absolute. So the line can be moved from freedom from pregnancy is more important a life to a life is more important than freedom from pregnancy.\n \n \nA fetus is not the equivalent to a newborn. Nowhere did I state this. I said even if the fetus is considered a person. The circumstances of pregnancy are unique and within those circumstances abortion is justified to me even if the fetus is considered a person under the law. What you stated here does not follow. Perhaps if you clarify?\n\n No where did I state you did. Actually, I've said several times that some pro-abortionist do consider it to be equivelant but still think abortion should be allowed whenever desired. It's the problem with debating multiple people on semi-related issues.\n \n \nI never said the fetus was unliving. Please don't make assumptions, Zardoz.\nSee above. Also, many pro-abortionists have differing levels of what constitutes 'living'. I'm not trying to build a straw man or put words in your particular mouth. Simply address various points.\n \n \nIt is an overly verbose way of describing something in order to make it more palatable or pleasant. It's PC.\n\n Says you. I could say that the mitigating word I leave out is Child. as in Unborn child. Which would be pro-life verbage. While fetus is a technical term, it is often politically identified with pro-choice verbage.\n Once again, hair splitting. If you prefer, since I'm anti-abortion, I'll simply say child, baby or unborn X. \n \n \nI honestly couldn't care less what you use, but it really does amuse me.\n\n I find it equally amusing that you even bring it up. Most people who try to get you to change your positions often use verbage exchanges. If I were to use fetus, I can end up acknowledging that it is somehow less equitable that a born child.\n Or, have you studied psychology and arts of persuasion?\n \n \nLegal consent is required for the claim that the fetus has a legal right to the woman's body (any part) to have any basis. I agree that people should make responsible decisions and take into consideration the consequences of their action. Legally enforcing moral responsibility is fascist, however. Pregnancy should not be used as punishment for irresponsible behavior, it should not be a learning tool or a beating stick or a punishment. To do so denigrates women in general and mothers in particular.\n\n Legally enforcing morality is fascist. You stating that I should allow the death of a child for what I consider to be poor reasoning is a forcing your morality onto me issue. You might not see it that way. No different that those who stood up to the fascist in germany or elsewhere. Why do you think pro-lifers try to equate abortion practices to the holocaust?\n Both sides are telling the other to 'accept it'.\n \n \n \nAgreed, there is no 100% security against these things. However, even as you said:  Just like having unprotected sex doesn't mean you want to contract an STD \n\n Wanting one and getting one is two different things.\n If you're aware that the possible out come of getting an STD from consentual sex is there, you acknowledge that. Just as pregnancy is for sex.\n Some people refuse consent in the case of rape. Others can't legally give consent such as a minor. \n \n [quote]Yes, it is herself, for even you say: It isn't seperate until is comes out.[/qyuote] That was role reversal used to counter a point made. I personally consider it to be seperate.\n \n \nYes, I do. A fetus should have the same consideration. No-one, not even the least capable member of society, should have the legal right to live attached to anyone else against that other's will and without that other's consent.\n\n It's defining when consent is given and whether is can be recanted. Similar to a contract.\n \n \nHowever, a finite or consumable resource cannot be used by two different people at the same time. Your examples are not comparable.\n\n Ypu're saying a womans body is a finite and consumable resource?\n Is she useing her womb for any other purpose?\n \n \nYou're proposed course of action of indenturing the baby is disregarded as nonsensical.\n\n Because you say so? \n It was just a finciful statement but it could be enacted if desired. Many things can.\n How many times have experts stated the financial cost of raising a child? Just tab the expenses to the child for later reinbursement to the state which pays the mother to care for the child. No different than debts being passed onto th child from the father which was a practice done (is done) in some places. Our moraility and laws did away with such.\n \n \nHow was that number come to?\n\n LOL, pulled out of my bung. It's speculation.\n \n \nEntitled?! rofl! No-one is entitled to the use of your organs and the energy your body produces. Your labor may be used against your will, but the energy that your body produces is being used by yourself.\n\n Where is this defined and legally stated? That you can't force someone to use their body? I really don't think it is. \n Labor is nothing more than use of energy a body produces. From forced labor and community service to taxation. There are precidents. \n \n \nSo you're going to legally force pregnancy because... extra body tissue translates into survivability?\n\n Acutually, yes. In many situations, extra body mass does translate into survivability. It's all depedant on the situation. Who's going to survive the elements better? The person with insulating body fat and stored energy...or little mrs anorexia?\n \n \nThis role-reversal destroys the pro-life argument. If the fetus is a part of the mother and has no identity separate from her then what basis do you have for protecting it under the law? What are you protecting? An organ? There is nothing to protect because there is nothing inside the woman but more of the woman.\n\n That it isn't legal or allowed to 'do anything with your body that you desire' which is what some pro-abortionists seem to think is the case.\n Some make that claim. 'It's my body, I can do with it as I please.' Which isn't true, at least not universally. \n \n \nYou are right, it is not a legal citizen until it comes out. Then it receives the full protection of the law :) Why can you award resources? There no individual to award them to!\n\n Were it to be true. Witness the fetal homicide issue where it is considered to be a person. Odd how on one hand, you can eliminate it and have no reprecussions and on the other, it's considered murder to do so.",

   "Simone: I don't care to know the reasons for choosing abortion. It's not my body involved, it's not my decision. \n \n Zardoz: Then I don't care if someone kills or rapes you. 'It's not my body.' Right? \n Does that sound like the most insensitive thing you've ever heard? I think it is and would look extremly down upon any one who made that statement to me OR to you. So, why can you freely make that comment and I can't?\n I'm curious as to your reaction to me if I were to say 'I don't care if racists kill off all blacks, I'm not black so I don't care.'\n \n Simone: I'm trying to make sense out of your statement in reference to mine. I favor a woman having autonomy over her own body. You introduce in comparison the spectacle of my losing autonomy over my own body by being raped by another person. How does that follow?\n\n It follows that I don't care what happens to you. period. ((Which isn't the case in reality)). Just as you say you don't care what happens to the baby.\n That's the line of thinking.\n You care more about a mothers choice than a childs life.\n That may not be the way you think but, it is the way pro-lifers see your stance. So long as someone gets to exercise freedoms it doesn't really matter how they are achieved.\n I could say, 'it's good from my government to allow citizens to kill illegal immigrants. After all, they are parasitical to my society and have no rights under my law since they aren't citizens.'\n I don't consider that to be a moral stance. Don't take it myself and would fight against it if it were true and legal. Even if those following that law have no impact directly on me and only limited indirect impact (as they remove a burden to my society).\n \n \nAlso, you introduce the topic of racism being acted upon to the extent that it involves killing someone of the hated race, the ultimate denial of one's autonomy over one's own body. How does that follow in a sensible way my original statement?\n\n Racism in the context of killing someone else. See my comment on illegal immigrants. It doesn't have to be a particular race, just 'people I don't want around for X reason'.\n \n \n \n \n \nZardoz: As for your later comments on feminism. Universally getting women to feel and BE empowered should be the goal.\n I have a slightly different take though.\n I wouldn't say it's empowering to allow a woman to get an abortion to 'avoid' criticism and put downs for being an unwed mother. I'd say it's empowering them to make their own choices and not care about others comments.\n All you've done is replace 'unwed mother' with 'abortionists'.\n \n Simone: I wasn't aware that I was the particular person who replaced 'unwed mother' with 'abortionists.' What is the point of your statement in this regard?\n\n The point is that you're still going to be put down by someone. 'Unwed mothers' is replaced by 'abortionist'. You're still put down by those groups.\n Thus to say that being allowed to get an abortion eliminates that isn't true, it replaces it.\n Feminism should be geared towards stengthening the woman to not care (be impacted) about what others think and to limit their physical criticism if it were to occure.\n \n \nZardoz: Some see this as a differnence and woldn't redicule her for the abortion as they would an unwed pregnancy but that some would be few and far inbetween.\n Most people who would ridicule her for an unwed pregnancy would do the same or worse for an abortion. No change.\n \n Simone: I disagree. The issue is CHOICE, not abortion. It makes no difference to me whether a woman chooses abortion to to continue a pregnancy. OK, please allow me to raise my eyebrows askance if a woman chooses unwed motherhood repetitively, family reflex, I guess.\n\n Some women think they can do better as a solo parent (possibly given their choice of mate) and while desiring a child don't desire a partner.\n While I disagree with such notions, I don't personally ridicule one for taking them. But, in a high divorce environment, it's hard not to find those who think such. For example of my sister. Not reflective of the family. I certainly don't share her beliefs.\n \n \nZardoz: And those who wouldn't put her down for an abortion wouldn't do the same for an unwed pregnancy. No change.\n So, what have you accomplished?\n \n Simone: I disagree with this statement. I think that because of the Feminist movement--I am very proud to call myself a Feminist--unwed mothers and illegitimacy are no longer stigmatized to the same extent by Christians--because these Christians are afraid of Feminists--and they should be. I agree that in radically rightwing Christian areas unwed mothers are still so stigmatized but there has been a lot of progress made and WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED A LOT OF WHICH WE CAN BE PROUD!\n\n I'd say that both are still stigmatized but to different extents. I'd also state it has nothing to do with feminism itself and more to do with societial views on morality. Similar to mixed race marriages. As people see it more often, it has less impact on them. Show more unwed mothers and it's hard to throw a stone at someone without breaking your own window in your glass house. I'd say divorce laws and making them more common (no fault divorce) accounts to single mothers. When you have this, it's not too hard to push it into women who've never been married. 1970's attitudes often reflected the idea of 'why get married when you're just going to get a divorce.'\n I wouldn't say it's womens liberation that led this movement but they were there with it and took advantage of it.\n I just don't think that abortion rights had a lot of impact with equality. \n \n \nZardoz: Do you really think it's abortion rights that led to empowerment or simply women who refuse to be 2nd class citizens in ALL OTHER catagories?\n What's more important; equal pay for equal work or being allowed to get an abortion? Different answers by different people.\n \n Simone: The ability to choose safe, legal, accessible abortion gave women a great deal of control over their own lives and destinies, their ability to pursue careers without the career-threatening burden of pregnancy or being the primary caretaker of an unwanted child. Women are still not equal in the job market in terms of economics and access of abortion because they are hobbled into the \"Mommy Tract,\" meaning women who are divided by the concerns for both family and career that most men are free of. If you don't see that, you haven't the eyes to see.\n\n However, the pendulum, is swinging back towards mommys and parenting with maternity leave protections and family friendly work places. Not universal but there and growing. I don't think it has much to do with abortion allowing women to compete with the males but with women not accepting lesser treatment for who they are.\n \n \nZardoz: Society cares less and less about unwed mothers as it is. It's not something to glorify but it certainly isn't treated as the worst you can do like it was decades ago. Faulty reasoning and justification.\n \n Simone: Yes, you acknowlege that societal views have changed but you fail to acknowledge the role that Feminism and the Feminist fight for safe, legal, accessible abortion in making this so. It is time for you to acknowledge your debt to Feminism and the Right to Choose.\n\n I really don't think abortion rights made any of this possible.\n I could also twist the feminist agenda and lament what it's done to me. ;) LOL.\n I also find it ironic that I'm more feminist oriented than my wife who dispises them.\n I dismiss 'femanizis' and embrace the equal rights movement. Abortion isn't about equal rights...it's supposedly about womens rights.\n A feminist who champions equality is great. One who want's preferential treatment or considerations isn't.\n \n I'm not allowed to take a life (the unborn child/fetus) for the reasons a woman is. If I can't de-consent to parenthood, why should she? Or, can I chose to not be a parent in the 1st 9 months of pregnancy too?\n Of course, we all often view a pregnancy differently. You say it's choice for ones own body, I say it's choice over anothers.\n \n Anyway, glad you can vote. Hope you're paid the same for your type of work as anyone else is and hope you have every opprotunity in life ans a 'inny' as an 'outtie' does.\n \n \n Side note, while still opposed to welfare state attitudes, I am looking forward to watching Canada spread child day care support. Hopefully the liberal government there will get it in place before it collapses and is replaced by some conservative coalation (who hs vowed to support what ever the liberals had going)",

   "\n I would posit that laws should reflect established morality.\n\n \n I do not agree. Legislating morality for the sake of morality makes the gov't the judge of what is moral or not. This is textbook theism, which is another word for fascism. When individual rights become secondary to the will of the State we will have become the antithesis of what our current value system is.\n \n \n\n However, I acknowledge that morality, over recent time, has gone from the perspective of objective (all encompasing) to subjective (up to individual interpretation).\n Either way, there is no law that says we shouldn't pursue our own morality. Thus, so long as we're breaking no other law, we each can push our own agendas. If widely accepted, they can be established as law...or later repealed.\n\n \n Persuing our own morality is fine. Violating individual rights for your own morality is not.\n \n \n\n However, there are riles to follow when determining when you can end another life. Self defense being one (and even that has restrictions). Not a simple 'because'. It's why I can suppport the ending of a pregnancy when it risks the mothers life.\n\n \n Pregnancy is never a simple 'because'. Pregnancy causes very real and stressful changes to the body, always. The severity changes, ranging from life-threatening to health damaging to mildly uncomfortable and everything in between, but every pregnancy is detrimental to a woman's body and abortion is justified by the circumstances of pregnancy. Imo, of course. The laws vary from state to state, but every state law I've seen allows you to kill a burglar in your home and to kill those who are committing a felony trespass on your property. Yet your body is fair game? \n \n Incidentally, these implications are why pro-choice people accuse pro-life people of disregarding women. Implying that all the various problems and issues that a pregnant woman goes through that aren't life-threatening can be reduced to merely \"just because\" actually physically makes me sick.\n \n \n\n Exactly, legally. Abortion could be considered legally killing someone?\n\n \n Could abortion be considered legal killing? Yes, it could\n \n \n\n No? If so, why should it be allowed and no other forms of legal killing?\n\n \n There are other forms of legal killing. It's called \"justifiable homicide\"\n \n \n\n Death penalty has due process where the defendant has the chance to defend themselves. Most forms of legal killing are based upon the to be killed having done something to warrant the death such as break the law. Is their a law against being born?\n\n \n It's against the law to force someone to donate their organs without express consent and this is a form of that. It's also against the law to force a woman to remain pregnant against her will :)\n \n Tell me, what law did the woman violate when she had sex? Where is her due process to justify the removal of her rights? \n \n \n\n Still with the 'should not.' Just as with me, this is a belief and not an absolute. I disagree and think the woman should. Particularly in the cases where the pregnancy arose out of consentual sex and doesn't threaten the mothers life.\n\n \n Yes, \"should\". It is a belief, but it is more supported than yours is, imo. Even pro-life people recognize it is unconstitutional to have a national ban on abortion and most recognize that one's organs and life processes are not the property of the gov't to use as they wish. \n \n \n\n Choice is relative. There are many things you chose to do that you later can't 'unchose'. I consider pregnancy one of them.\n\n \n And yet you can! You simply don't want it to be, you think it is wrong to make that choice. Congratulations you have an opinion.\n \n \n\n I would have no problem with insurance or government stepping in to assist a woman who was proven to be unable to work due to pregnancy financially.\n I know many conservatives wouldn't though. Thus, my 'Put up or shut up' defense for your side.\n\n \n I would have no problem with a gov't assistance program that fully supports a pregnant woman and guarantees she will have her job afterwards. If this were the case there would be fewer abortions performed (for many are performed for financial reasons) without having to resort to violating her rights by banning abortion. Yay you have suggested something that will help solve the problem without violating her rights :) Why in heavens name would you still want to ban abortion? It will not solve the problem.\n \n \n\n :p\n From my view, rights are often arrainged in order of importance. Others may disagree.\n\n \n Many pro-lifers spout this drivel, and this view has little support. Without evidence why would I accept this? There is no hierarchy of rights, as evidenced by the fact that rights take precedence in differing orders depending on the situation; there is no consistent order.\n \n \n\n Initial consent is implied in consentual sex. Or, can we state saying that people aren't capable of giving consent when their hormonal levels are unbalanced due to lustful desires??? ;)\n\n \n Nowhere did I state or imply this. People are capable of consenting to pregnancy, they simply haven't. Consenting to sex is consenting to sex, it is not implied consent to anything else. You do not consent to STDs, as you've agreed. Yes, you must \"deal with\" an STD, but how you deal with it is up to you. The same with pregnancy. You can change the consequence if you wish to and are able to.\n \n \n\n Hair splitting on what is energy of ones own body and labor of one.\n\n \n Not so. When you labor, you are using your organs and bodily resources (including energy). In a similar way, you may be forced to behave a certain way via laws but no one can control what you think and feel without unconstitutional methods of conditioning and brainwashing. Those are internal and may only be used by yourself. You, however, wish to invade that inner domain with laws and legislate how and by whom a woman's internal organs and life-processes can be used.\n \n \n\n I see little to differ on when it comes to resoursces of ones own body and taxation. This resource of ones own body seems to be a new thing and often deals with abortion issues only, unless you have another expample.\n\n \n Taxation and forced organ donation are similar you say? I disagree. There is my example :)\n \n \n\n Can we define 'well being'? Or is this subjective?\n\n \n Subjective.\n \n \n\n ;)\n Qustion is, are you willing (or do) to act on this belief? Via voting or other awareness issues. Or, simply a voice on the net?\n\n \n Yes, I am.\n \n \n\n Not to the persons life you'r ending to achieve that 'freedom'.\n Otherwise, this seems like a decent reason to kill off the impoverished and expunge those who provide nothing to society. Somewhere along the lines, they are imposing on my and your freedoms. Once again, it's can. Not an absolute. So the line can be moved from freedom from pregnancy is more important a life to a life is more important than freedom from pregnancy.\n\n \n Except your example applies more to the pro-life argument than the pro-choice argument. Those born people are thinking, feeling citizens and have protection under the Constitution and their bodies are being violated (by being killed) by law. Similarly, women are thinking, feeling citizens who have protection under the Constitution and their bodies are being violated (by being forced to remain pregnant) by law. An embryo in the first trimester of pregnancy is none of these things.\n \n \n\n Says you. I could say that the mitigating word I leave out is Child. as in Unborn child. Which would be pro-life verbage. While fetus is a technical term, it is often politically identified with pro-choice verbage.\n Once again, hair splitting. If you prefer, since I'm anti-abortion, I'll simply say child, baby or unborn X. \n\n \n Use whatever you wish, it is still a euphemism.\n \n \n\n I find it equally amusing that you even bring it up. Most people who try to get you to change your positions often use verbage exchanges. If I were to use fetus, I can end up acknowledging that it is somehow less equitable that a born child.\n Or, have you studied psychology and arts of persuasion?\n\n \n I have studied the arts of persuasion, but I am not trying to get you to use \"fetus\". Truly, it is more exact and avoids confusion so I believe using \"fetus\" contributes more to an intellectual debate than overly emotional terms such as \"unborn baby\", but it honestly doesn't matter much to me.\n \n \n\n Legally enforcing morality is fascist. You stating that I should allow the death of a child for what I consider to be poor reasoning is a forcing your morality onto me issue.\n\n \n I should restate that. Legally enforcing morality for the sake of morality is a fascist belief, or is a step toward fascism.\n \n I am forcing my morality upon you by saying we cannot force our morality upon each other? Truly, you are being disingenuous. Saying we will not interfere with each other's life is the same as interfering with your life? One is offensive and the other is defensive. I'll leave it to you to figure out which is which.\n \n \n\n You might not see it that way. No different that those who stood up to the fascist in germany or elsewhere. Why do you think pro-lifers try to equate abortion practices to the holocaust?\n\n \n Because they do not understand the issues involved. We are indeed standing up to pro-life fascists.\n \n \n\n Both sides are telling the other to 'accept it'.\n\n \n I am ready to accept it, I'm just not willing to accept what you tell me to accept.\n \n \n\n Wanting one and getting one is two different things.\n\n \n Agreed :)\n \n \n\n If you're aware that the possible out come of getting an STD from consentual sex is there, you acknowledge that. Just as pregnancy is for sex.\n\n \n Agreed again! You're getting better ;) In both cases the consequence can be legally changed.\n \n \n\n That was role reversal used to counter a point made. I personally consider it to be seperate.\n\n \n Oh ho! So why is the fetus able to have rights none other has, namely living attached to another person against that other person's will?\n \n \n\n It's defining when consent is given and whether is can be recanted. Similar to a contract.\n\n \n As far as I know, more than verbal consent is needed to harvest organs and donate blood. Verbal consent is all that is required to consent to sex, but the donation of bodily resources require a legal document.\n \n So, this is all the debate is about? Are you willing to drop all your other arguments? Without legal consent, you have no basis for the claim that a fetus has any legal right to a woman's body.\n \n \n\n Ypu're saying a womans body is a finite and consumable resource?\n Is she useing her womb for any other purpose?\n\n \n Oh... I see. A woman only has the right to the parts of her body she is actively using? If she isn't using her clitoris, is that the gov'ts property as well? If she isn't using her appendix, that belongs to the gov't to use as they see fit? No, the womb is perhaps not being used to carry anything within, but that does not mean it does not have a use in the body nor does it mean it now belongs to another.\n \n The resources I was refering to are the organ processes and the energy resources. Both are finite. The energy resources can be renewed when the woman eats, but why does the fetus have any right to the nutrients the woman's body ingests? Those nutrients do not belong to the gov't and they do not belong to the fetus. They belong to the woman.\n \n \n\n Because you say so? \n It was just a finciful statement but it could be enacted if desired. Many things can.\n How many times have experts stated the financial cost of raising a child? Just tab the expenses to the child for later reinbursement to the state which pays the mother to care for the child. No different than debts being passed onto th child from the father which was a practice done (is done) in some places. Our moraility and laws did away with such.\n\n \n Actually, the fetus is not what is forcing the woman to remain pregnant, the gov't is. If any entity owes the woman it would be the gov't in this case. If they wish to support every woman through pregnancy I really believe it would cut down on the number of abortions. Who wants to abort that gravy train?!\n \n However, having the option open would still be necessary.\n \n \n\n Where is this defined and legally stated? That you can't force someone to use their body? I really don't think it is. \n\n \n You cannot force someone to donate their organs, blood, marrow, etc (any bodily resource) to you. Do you honestly believe our bodies are property of the gov't? Do you honestly think that you should be legally required to donate your organs and life processes, even to save someone else? Don't you think it should be personal choice?\n \n \n\n Labor is nothing more than use of energy a body produces. From forced labor and community service to taxation. There are precidents. \n\n \n These do not compare. Your own body is still using your own energy. You are not being forced to use your organ processes and bodily resources to provide life-support for another.\n \n \n\n Acutually, yes. In many situations, extra body mass does translate into survivability. It's all depedant on the situation. Who's going to survive the elements better? The person with insulating body fat and stored energy...or little mrs anorexia?\n\n \n I'm sorry, when did we start enacting laws based on insulation and stored energy? Anorexia is not illegal, even if I personally believe it is a bad choice.\n \n \n\n Were it to be true. Witness the fetal homicide issue where it is considered to be a person. Odd how on one hand, you can eliminate it and have no reprecussions and on the other, it's considered murder to do so.\n\n \n Yes, the laws are inconsistent. Those in the womb are not legal citizens, however. The laws you speak of (at least some) are pro-life propaganda laws designed to create precedence for a national ban on abortion. Similar legislation making the woman the victim and doing the same job are voted against by the same people who vote for the ones you speak of.",

   "\n Yes, because \"we cannot force our morality upon each other?\" is a moral apprasal.\n\n \n No, it's more of a statement of fact about the values of our society (values are distinct from morals, holding in esteem rather than thinking something is right vs. wrong). A moral statement would be \"Forcing morality is bad\", which I certainly do believe but I am not using that as justification for my argument. If I were to state \"We should not force our morality on each other because that's bad\" I would be performing the same error that you are. Instead, I am basing it upon the values, both explicit and implied, in the Constitution. These values include personal responsibility, not governmentally enforced responsibility.\n \n \n\n I'll also state that we're the defensive one since we're coming to the defense of another life.\n You say we're interfering with a womans life.\n\n \n That life is inside of a woman. You must necessarily interfere with her body in order to defend it. The pro-choice argument is purely defensive, since it is, in essence: leave me alone. It does not interfere (when the vast majority of abortions are performed) with any other thinking, feeling, conscious citizen. You, however, are advocating offensive interference, not defensive protection.\n \n \n\n Not quite the same thing.\n We're perfectly willing to leave a woman alone so long as she refrains from harming another.\n Same as with any other potential killer. We won't bother you if you refrain from harming someone.\n It's not violating anothers rights. It's protecting someones rights.\n\n \n By \"protecting someones rights\" (the fetus currently has no right to live attached to the woman) you must violate hers. The gov't cannot Constitutionally do this.\n \n \n\n Pretty simple actually.\n\n \n Agreed.\n \n \n\n And, society DOES insert morality into law making. Nearly every law is based on established morality. That morality is a way to get people to live together smoothly is nice also.\n\n \n Are you trying to use reductionist thinking to say that complex human behavior including laws can be explained simply by saying it is based on morals? Using this argument, it would be equally valid to say that complex human behavior, including laws and morals, can be explained in terms of a desire to survive. Perhaps they can be, but this provides no insight into complex human behavior. This is an empty argument.\n \n Morals are not made into laws for the sake of morality, or at least they should not be.\n \n \n\n Theology as you tried to put it is religious theism. Rule of religion\n Nice try, but, I'm not a theist unlike others here who'd say God gives morality.\n It is possible to have morality without a mythical entity handing it down.\n\n \n Having the gov't decide what is moral or not would be a theist society, or a fascist society. Theism is marked by a belief that these morals are divinely ordained (need I point out the example of GWB?), but the end result is the same.\n \n Tell me, if these morals were not handed down by a higher authority, why should they have any authority over the entire nation? The State exists to serve the people, the people do not serve the States interests, even if those interests are \"moral\". \n \n \n\n If morality is reflected in the laws, then it is the government that judges morality...but, in a representative government, it's just a reflection of the people.\n\n \n Reflection or no (and who really believes our gov't is truly representative anymore?), the State does not exist to mold individual wills or their morals.\n \n \n\n Currently, you have the law reflecting your morality in some regards.\n\n \n It's called the Constitution :)\n \n \n\n That can change. Just as all laws can change.\n\n \n Agreed, it can. I happen to like the freedom that this document esteems.\n \n \n\n If I have to accept the law as it is now (still with the means to affect change) will you do so also if it were reversed (using the same methods as I to legally repeal it) OR would you engage in 'illegal' activities because your morality dictated it...illegal abortions as is bandied about.\n\n \n Agreed, I would have to accept it, though I would work to change it. Yes, I would probably engage in illegal activities because my morals dictated it.\n \n \n\n So, please don't have an abortion...think of all the poor little future tax payers/consumers.\n\n \n Future taxpayers? \n \n emoticon_confused",

   "*sigh*\n \n I swear I said this before. \n \n Low birth rates are due to a number of reasons.\n \n As the world saw during the early 1900s, the cost of raising a child steadily increased while child morality decreased. Because of higher costs and the need to have fewer children to ensure that some will survive, fewer children were born. Also, as urban life began to grow at the expense of farm life, even fewer children were needed. Low birth rates dropped from three to 2.4 in the beginning of the 20th century. \n \n During the last 40 years, more and more women have joined the workforce and become active workers having long term carreers. As women move into the workforce, they have less children for obvious reasons. They have less time to take care of them, and as the work for a specific goal, the age at which they have children forces them to have even fewer children. The age for marrying is now mids to late twenties instead of early 20s and late teens. Birth rates will decreases as the age for child rearing moves further and further away from optimal child birthing ages. \n \n Furthermore, as in the 1900s, the cost of raising a child has expoentially increased; it costs almost $100,000 to raise one child from birth to age 18. If you account for college, that could easily triple. With less time to spend raising a child, huge costs, later birthing periods and careers, birth rates are going to decreases regardless of abortion.\n \n Seriously, don't any of you have any basic economics or history knowledge?\n \n As for immigration, it makes alot more sense economically. Alllowing immigration lets the nation accepting them enjoy the benefits that the nation of origin paid for. The cost of education, housing, food, and other such costs are not burdend on the country accepting, but on the country of origin. The country of accepting, such as Canada then uses these immigrants to work without having to pay for their education costs.",
