The fact that another area which doesn't have a bad speeding problem isn't as \"protected\" is irrelevant.\n Would it make sense for the Jackson neighborhood, which doesn't have as much speeding, to require as much police presence to combat speeding as the Johnson neighborhood which has a habitual presence? \n NO!\n \n The LAW gets applied unilaterally and equally. Neither fat kids nor black kids nor gay kids should get bullied.\n But when there is a pronounced problem for one group, you obviously need MORE ATTENTION to enforce the law for that group.",
