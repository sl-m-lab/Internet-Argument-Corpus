   "China, the Olympics, and a man named Obama running for President of the United States!\n \n An Updated Commentary by David Duke\n http://www.davidduke.com\n \n I watched the opening of the Olympic Games in Beijing. It was amazing, but not just for its heroic scale and artistic beauty. It was amazing because it was an unabashed celebration of Chinese history, culture heritage and indeed of the Chinese people in their unique expression of humanity. The games were an eloquent statement of their identity.\n \n As the camera panned out across the Olympic field and there were thousands of Chinese dancers and singers celebrating their Chinese-ness. That's a new word and a tough one to say.\n \n Among the tens of thousands of performers I did not see any European faces or for that matter any black faces anywhere on the field. Every performer was Chinese. Everyone had a distinctive Asian fold in the corners of their eyes. China to the Chinese means a lot more than simply the collection of races or peoples that live in the geographical area of China. It means to them, the unique traits and character of the Chinese people and not just the people that reside within the political boundaries of China.\n \n China is the most populous nation on earth with 1.3 billion. It is practically all Chinese. Hong Kong, even when it was independent was considered a \"Chinese\" city. The Chinese have a clear understanding of what China is. To them it is a nation of Chinese people with Chinese identity, history, culture, tradition character and dare I say it: The genetic underpinning of it all - the unique character of their DNA that gives them their appearance, their talents and their underlying nature.\n \n The Chinese are free from the overwhelming media propaganda that pervades the Western world and are free from a specific ethnocentric group that dominates the American media and has inordinate influence on Western governments. They are not saturated with propaganda intended to make them feel guilty for being Chinese.\n \n American guilt and self-loathing are typified by the reaction to former President Clinton's June 13, 1998 speech that he made at Portland State University. He praised the new diversity in America and he spoke optimistically of the time when European Americans will become a minority in the country our own forefathers established. Here is what he said:\n \n \"But now we are being tested again - by a new wave of immigration larger than any in a century, far more diverse than any in our history...Today, largely because of immigration, there is no majority race in Hawaii or Houston or New York City. Within five years there will be no majority race in our largest state, California. In a little more than 50 years there will be no majority race in the United States. (Applause.) No other nation in history has gone through demographic change of this magnitude in so short a time.\"(Applause)\n \n In actual fact, the most recent figures say that Europeans will become a minority in America in far less time than that. How propagandized and sick our people have become. In Portland, Oregon the overwhelmingly White student audience applauded the demise of their own people. Could one imagine Afro-Americans in Atlanta applauding a remark that African-Americans there would soon become a minority? Could anyone in his wildest imagination, picture thousands of Chinese celebrating their own demise as a people in their own country?\n \n They know that if non-Chinese elements migrate or breed their way to dominance in some China provinces that it will ultimately result in conflict, and perhaps eventually to terrorism and civil war. That's why even though there are some border areas of China where there are people of different ethnic origin, the government has consciously promoted massive Chinese immigration into those areas. They want one nation and they have consciously thought about their future and what will happen if non-Chinese minorities grow in great number.\n \n That's precisely the root of what's happening in Tibet. Obviously massive Chinese immigration into Tibet is catastrophic for the Tibetan people and for their unique heritage, religion, culture and freedom. When another identifiable group with their own will to power becomes a majority in the country the indigenous people will be controlled by them. That should be obvious to anyone. It is demographics 101. The Chinese do fundamentally what they see as good for their own people, and so do the Tibetan people. Such behavior about the welfare of your own people is normal for most of the world, but of course, not permitted for the European people. It is the most natural thing in the world. Every expression of life on the planet seeks to preserve itself, except that now, seemingly Europeans and Americans don't.\n \n Of course, it wasn't always like that. Up until 1965, the American people and the American government consciously wanted to preserve the heritage of European Americans, and they had immigration quota systems so the demographic composition would be preserved. It was far less racial nationalist than the policies of China or most of the non-European world today. For instance the Chinese are obviously not trying to maintain the status quo in regard to non-Chinese minorities; they are trying to \"Chinafy\" every square kilometer of China. That's why the Tibetan people are in trouble, and here is where I part ways with Chinese thinking. The Tibetan nation and people should survive. The Chinese people also have that right and all peoples should have that right.\n \n The question to me is whether the Chinese have to wipe out Tibet to survive. Obviously, they don't. At the same time I obviously don't think we should go to war with China over Tibet. But, there are many economic and other policies that can be used to help encourage nations to respect the rights of others and I believe we should use those influences to help the Tibetans survive in their culture and their heritage.\n \n The Olympic Games have people of all races present from all corners of the world. It's about peoples and nations competing together in a spirit of fairness and friendship, but it is not a celebration of the homogeneity of mankind. It is actually a celebration of Mankind's diversity. This rich cultural and physical diversity exists because of ancient ethnic separations that created the different races in the first place, and it gave them their distinctions and character. Race is a product of geographic separation for thousands of years. Evolution is only possible, not just on the level of the individual but it also must occur on the level of the gene pool. Every bit of mankind's progress on the evolutionary scale came about in the survival of a specific population that carried forth favorable genetic factors.\n \n The carrier of the American Flag for the United States at this Olympics is Lopez Lomong, an immigrant from Africa. The main flag bearer for China was Yao Ming. Yao Ming does not't live in China. In fact, to them it doesn't matter where he lives, the essential factor is that Ming is Chinese. Having a European or an African carry the Chinese flag would be simply unthinkable.\n \n For the last 2000 years up until just 40 years ago, almost any cultural function in Europe, a public performance or concert, or fair, or sporting event or political rally - would have been an all-European version of the opening and closing ceremonies of the Chinese Olympics. Europe was for all practical purposes all White. Even in America, although there was an historically small minority of Africans and an even smaller minority of Mexicans and Asians, each race had its own expression and lived in its own community. America was deemed a white nation as typified by every White president, by the fact that every signer of the Declaration of Independence and author of the Constitution was of European descent.\n \n All that's changed in the blink of an eye, historically and the change accelerates with each passing day. The racial expression of America was perhaps just 40 years ago typified by Cary Grant and Grace Kelly. Not Lopez Lomong or Marion Jones. Marion Jones is the disgraced and imprisoned gold medalist, who is perhaps America's most famous Olympic Athlete.\n \n America may soon have a president with the unlikely name of Barack Hussein Obama, a man who for the past 20 years was a leading member of a church that condemned America weekly from the pulpit and proclaimed its loyalty to Africa. On the other side, John McCain is a man who supported open borders and amnesty and made his own private effort to change American demographics with an adoption from Bangladesh. Of course, Obama and McCain have both reaffirmed their commitment to Israel as a Jewish state and sworn to send American boys and American gold to fight endless wars for Israel. But both McCain and Obama would never even acknowledge the fact that our people of European descent in both Europe and America have a fundamental right to survive and to have a government and culture that reflects our own values, traditions, culture and identity.\n \n The Chinese who run their own media and their own government would never put someone in power, who was opposed to the rights of the Chinese to survive and thrive. That goes without saying, and that's the difference between China and the European and American nations.\n \n China has 1.3 billion people. It's all Chinese. In Europe and America as well as all other nations with significant White presence such as Australia and New Zealand and in South American nations, the White demographic shrinks ever more rapidly.\n \n Unless we begin to think more like the Chinese and less like the Hollywood and New York axis of media want us to think, we, the race of Shakespeare and Newton, of Michaelangelo and DaVinci, of Shockley and Watson, of Washington and Jefferson, Elizabeth and Victoria, will be wiped off the face of the Earth. The people that have led the world in science, medicine, exploration, and given unsurpassed beauty and artistic expression to the Earth, and who have actually put the footprints of mankind on the moon, will pass to oblivion.\n \n It seems strange that I must use the Olympics in China to explain to our own people, why they have a right to live, a right to go on in their unique and beautiful expression.\n \n It is my deep belief that our people will awaken to the abyss before them.\n \n Sometimes it takes showing the realities of race in other countries for us to see objectively the crisis in our own nation.\n \n Pointing out the realities of China and the Chinese Olympics can do that. Another thing that should do that is the catastrophic lack of choice in the American election for president. What a contrast, the unabashed celebration of Chinese-ness at the Beijing Olympics, and the two enemies of our European American heritage who vie for President of the United States.\n \n Thank you for being with me, and for having the ability to think independently.",
