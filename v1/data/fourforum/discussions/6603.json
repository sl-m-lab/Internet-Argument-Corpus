   "Clustered throughout our debates are the continual assertion that people have certain rights. This is powerfully evidenced on the abortion threads, where the \"rights\" of the mother to choice and the pursuit of happiness and the \"rights\" of the fetus (argued on the grounds that it is a person) are both leveled against the other side. This isn't the place to debate these particular cases, but it raises the question to me of where is it that we derive rights from? Most people seem to think that they have a set of things that are intrinsic rights belonging to them. Why is that? Beneath legal rights, what is the philosophical justification for human rights? I'd be glad for anyone willing to articulate the system by which they arrive upon human rights--or the system by which they say there are no human rights. The simple answer is given by the Constitution which says rights are given by God. But there are quite a lot of athiests and agnostics who vehemently argue the case of human rights. Whence comes the justification? Some might say that rights are merely social constructs, but I find that shallow and simplistic explanation. Explain to me, if you are willing, the foundation of rights either theistically or atheistically.",

   "You think human rights, then, have nothing to do with anything that is intrinsically good or evil, right or wrong, proper or improper? There is, in fact, no standard of what \"should\" be a human right, we have only the arbitrary realization of things that are, without any way to consider their value beyond functionality?\n Consider how empty this view is; we are looking at qualities to justify human action that have no substance beyond the capriciousness of human will. If this is truly the way it is then there are rights only for the powerful, and anyone advocating rights for the oppressed is sorely mistaken. Behind these empty qualities we have no controllers for human action; herein lies the ultimate justification for oppression of one's fellow man--as long as you are able, you have the right. If we've learned anything through human history, and all the savagery and abuse inflicted by tyrants upon the helpless, I think we should have learned that rights are more than an expression for the power of one person related to another, that there is something wrong with a capricious view of human rights that allows some privilege over others. We have a general term for the phenomenon of this understanding of human rights, and that is injustice.\n This is not apparent at first, I will grant. At first glance, one might say, a social contract view of rights seems perfectly reasonable. Once you show people that there will be the greatest overall happiness if they respect the \"rights\" of others they will comply. But our pretty picture dissolves rapidly under the scrutiny of reality. Humans are not that generous, not on the whole. There are places where a social contract definition of rights might succeed in creating free and democratic society. There are others, however, where dictators control and they could claim the same justification. Those under them have no power with which to oppose them, therefore no bargaining weight in the contract, and therefore no \"rights\" or very limited \"rights.\" We see these two divergent paths which are both justifiable in the materialist/economic approach we have taken towards rights whereby they are regarded as qualities empty outside of human arbitrariness. The fundamental flaw with this philosophy, then, is that oppression and injustice are perfectly consistent with it--not that it will necessarily lead to such abuses, but that such abuses are no violation of the system. There is something to this gaping reality of inconsistency--that this understanding of rights justifies a society where for most there are no rights--that defies the philosophy from having clout outside the world of theory.\n So you see the hurdle I am unable to cross, why I find such a fully social-cooperative approach ultimately unsatisfactory. This concept of rights devoid of foundation defies any acknowledgment that an action can be wrong or evil, makes moral qualities empty, and so doing fails to reconcile itself with history and the experiences of modern humanity alike.",

   "@Quardon7 :\n \n Rights which belong to all human beings by nature and independent of positive law, are called natural rights. (I would distinguish \"human rights\" as the theory of natural rights recast in the rhetoric of modern liberalism.)\n \n The following questions arise from this definition: \n \n 1). Are there any rights which can be described as \"natural\" ?\n \n 2). Which rights are natural ? \n \n 3). Under what conditions will people be persuaded to recognize or believe in them ? \n \n 4). Under what conditions will people uphold them ?\n \n Many philosophers have tried to answer the first question by reference to a theory of natural law. The second question has been traditionally answered in terms of rights to defend life, limb, liberty and property - some of which, it is suggested, are inalienable rights. (The right to life being the most notable). \n \n In response to the third and fourth questions, some realists will argue that natural rights are only recognized when a legal procedure that conforms to natural justice has been established. In other words, when the rule of law is presupposed. \n \n Skeptics are not convinced that the doctrine of natural rights has any sort of objective basis - but some are prepared to admit that it is a \"necessary\" human illusion that is politically convenient. At the extremity here is Jeremy Bentham's celebrated utilitarian view that the theory of natural rights is \"nonsense on stilts\".\n \n Excuse me breaking down your initial statement into these rather pedantic steps, but this is a complicated field of inquiry that (I think) requires a logical step by step structure on which to build a discussion.",

Namely, man vs himself, and man vs man. That's not trivial in the least.\n \n Desire for freedom (selfish action but freedom sounds so yummy)\n Desire for security/quality of life/self-fulfillment/power (Giving up some selfish things to obtain other ones that are presumably more desireable).\n \n \n A right is a declaration by a person, or group of persons that they should get something, be it material, an action, or a choice. Nothing is built in about rights being good, or bad (subjective), right or wrong, shallow or deep.\n \n Rights are certainly one of the founding principles of our society.\n \n =\n You and I are stuck on a desert island and get amnesia with regards to society. We constantly fight over the same fish in the same shallow pool, and one day, sitting there battered and bruised, we say \"Is there not a way we can both have fish, and not fight?\" \"Sure, I can kill you when you sleep.\" \"Well, but I could kill you when YOU sleep.\" So after many a sleepless night, we two extraordinarily tired citizens of the island, meet again and say, \"Man, I'm tired, can we not just agree that it's your right to fish tomorrow and every other day after, and I will fish the days in between? OK, let's carve this into this big stone tablet. You have the right to fish every other day, starting tomorrow. I have the right to finish every other day starting the day after tomorrow. So be it. Agreed? Sign here.\"\n \n <<<<<Rights. Created for man, by man. The definition of rights (as used with regards to our society or other human societies), necessarily means they were put in place by the choice of humans.\n \n If you mean, what are the origins of the rights we have in our constitution, they do indeed stem from thousands, if not millions, of years of human or human ancestor civilizations, products of both our physiology, our knowledge, and our philosophies. All of which took countless years, trial and error, and a few capable leaders who brainstormed and drafted the document. The legacy of lives and deaths, of knowledge gained, then lost, only to be gained again, all contributed to our Constitution. Some countries may have consistutions that you may not be proud of, or agree with, or that may be contradictory to our own. Nothing is inherent in a right, or in a constitution, but I for one believe strongly, on both rational and emotional grounds, with much of the U.S. constitution.\n \n -Mach",

   " This concept of rights devoid of foundation defies any acknowledgment that an action can be wrong or evil, makes moral qualities empty, and so doing fails to reconcile itself with history and the experiences of modern humanity alike.\n\n \n Exactly wrong, but it's a common dillema.\n \n This entire issue you have is resolvable, through thinking it through. I can help show you, but I can't resolve it for you.\n \n I should say at the begining though, that this is a question of human choice, and the acknowledgement that without that choice, we are slaves. With the choice, we are free. Choose before you begin, slavery, or freedom. If you are free, you may read on. If you are a slave, find your shackles man and unlock them!\n \n -------------\n \n Actions are actions, just that.\n \n Actions, in this case, human actions, that are driven by CHOICE, we can then apply a subjective criteria and declare:\n - That action (resulting from your choice) is bad/evil.\n - That action (resulting from your choice) is good.\n \n OK. Who defines good and bad?\n \n Humans do. In every case, the individual does. In many societies, for them to function, they agree on a common set of rights and wrongs. Without rules, anarchy, right? Those rules define \"for the society\", or \"against the society\". Both the rules and for/against are decided yes, I know, tedious repetition, by human choice.\n \n So, it's not a subjective matter to say:\n It's illegal to drive over a rabbit.\n Bob drove over a rabbit.\n Therefore, bob broke the law.\n \n But it is a subjective matter to say:\n Therefore Bob did a bad thing.\n \n Of course, depending on how you define \"bad\". But in my experience, bad means \"against somone else's idea of good and bad\". It is not inherent,once again, it's a human choice.\n \n Bad: Something that hurts your family.\n The rabbit is not a member of your family.\n The death of the rabbit will not measurably affect your family.\n Therefore, what Bob did was not \"bad\".\n \n Now, if you came along, and re-defined bad as:\n \"something that hurts any living thing\".\n \n Bob is now \"bad\" according to you. But then again, we're all bad in that case, we kill countless living things just by living, showering, etc.\n \n As you might imagine, definitions are helpful to us when they have clear meaning, and when they serve a purpose. In a society, again it benefits the society to have definitions for important things. We do. We use right and wrong all the time, good and bad...but many individuals avoid \"good and evil\", because they imply religious mythology, which while historically noteworthy, is ultimately a denial of reality.\n ==============================\n \n You are the only person I would place the resonsbility in, to decide what is right, and wrong. Without granting you that, I deny you freedom.\n \n We can of course disagree, or justify our definitions and choices, and if we are rational we might arrive at agreement, but that's maybe another topic.\n \n Most large groups of free people end up agreeing on the big issues of what is right and wrong. Just as large groups of people get most questions right, statistically, when they have a stake in being right or wrong. Yes, 2 heads are generally better than one! It's no surprise that many civilizations have come to agreement, and then that agreement is also arrived at by other civilizations. That's quite natural.\n \n I am humbled by the fact that human choice, ends up being the foundation for right and wrong. It's empowering, and scary, and required for a free society.\n \n To suggest that human choice is empty of meaning, is slavery, it's saying our choices have no meaning, no validity. It's saying the woman who throws herself into a bullet to save her son did it out of an empty reason, or it was meaningless since in fact this fantastic mythological beast MADE her do it, or TOLD her to do it. It was her choice that we appluad or decry, and only if she had the freedom to chose does it qualify for having such a reaction.\n \n A man is chained to a tree, and just out of reach is a gun.\n Do we applaud the man's action of not shooting the kid next door when he could not choose to kill the kid? Of course not, he's chained, he has no choice. \n - He's thrown the key, unlocks the chain, picks up the gun, an kills the kid. \n - He's thrown the key, unlocks the chain, picks up the gun and unloads it takes it home so no kid stumbles across a loaded gun.\n \n Doesn't right or wrong require choice, and action, of humans? \n \n It couldn't be a less-empty ideal of right and wrong. In fact, I'd say that a human telling you that this or that is \"evil\" because they wrote that a mythological entity told them, is the very definition of \"without meaning\". Your idea seems to be the exact opposite of how I view the words.\n \n Freedom. Choice. Society.\n \n Much more powerful to me than:\n \n Fantasy.\n \n -Mach",

   "Well, in viewing these valuable responses there are a lot of things to say, so forgive me if I miss some elements of the arguments presented.\n \n First, Mach, I'm going to have to admit that I'm not as free as you are, by your standards. I don't know how much of modern man's freedom you have embraced but it is likely more than I. Much of humanity has declared itself free from religion, from morality, from absolutes, even from logical consistency (not to accuse you of the last, but that seems to be how far our freedom has gotten). Some would say that in embracing that freedom we have become enslaved to something else...but to speak of that is to get far off track. In any case, I am not so free--by your thinking--as you and if that causes you to discard any of the things I say...there's nothing I can do about that.\n \n In starting this thread I was searching for primarily atheistic frameworks for human rights, looking for something that might prove more satisfying than the social contract theory. None have been forthcoming, but many defenders of social contracts leapt to the field; I will take this to support my initial suspicion that there are no other convincing atheistic human rights theories.\n \n In response to these delineations of social contract theory I want to level this criticism; it lacks ultimate efficacy. Social contract rights are only effective within the ability of humans to force acquiescence. In some places that ability is severely limited, and nowhere is it near perfect. The fundamental principle of this theory is that humans are selfish, and that selfishness is applauded as what maintains order. But in making this move, to not only acknowledging the obvious selfishness of humanity but to reinforcing and praising it we give full reign to the impetus behind all violence even as we strive for a humanistic method to prevent it. What I'm saying is this; selfishness is the root of violence, putting one's own desires above the wellbeing of others. The selfishness of a man is what prompts him to rape a woman, even though the experience was thoroughly degrading to her, and it is what prompts him to steal from another. The social contract says \"it is in your best interest to agree to x rights\" and in doing so it says of the actions of rape and theft that they may not be done yet says of the reason for them that it is perfectly valid.\n \n Is the inconsistency clear yet? In a social contract society I am told that my selfishness should keep me from killing my neighbor, because if I do I will be thrown in jail. In telling me that, it acknowledges that I am centered upon my own desire to kill this neighbor who has offended me and turns that desire into the reason I shouldn't do it, making a greater selfish desire. But my ultimate devotion to myself has been reinforced all the more so that while guards have been put in place externally--that is, outside of myself--to prevent me from committing murder the same rationale that placed them has given full sway internally to my impetus to violence.\n \n That is where we see the intensely limited quality of these prohibitions. What if I am smarter than those who enforce the laws protecting human rights? Then I will commit whatever acts of violence I please, because the counterproductive logic that placed external safeguards on the rights of those I wished to harm removed the internal barracades that might have prevented me from it. That is why the social contract is powerless against all the violence in America today. The BTK killer did what he did because modern man has said there is nothing preventing you from doing violence except the force of society to stop you. We see so much gun violence, and what is the proposed cure? Make guns harder to come by. Granted, without guns there isn't gun violence, and don't rip this out of context and say I'm advocating we sell AK-47s beside the magazine racks in grocery stores--but would it not prove ultimately more effective if there were something society reinforced within the minds of its members that prompted less selfishness? This, I would like to suggest is where morality meets human rights.\n \n To borrow an illustration from the esteemed Mach, what does the social contract do for a man who wants to shoot a kid? It takes his gun away and puts him in prison (or chains him to a tree). Granted, there is nothing to be applauded here that he does not shoot the kid. Rather, it truly is his choice that makes a difference to our estimation of him when he is free to act. But I see this example as saying perhaps the opposite of what it intended. It is the social contract theory that chains him so he is not free to act as he chooses, and rightly so in order to prevent anarchy. But the social contract theory is not neutral in regard to influencing his choice, for it grooms in him the selfishness that first made him think it was okay to shoot the kid, so on the one hand it chains him and on the other it propels him forth to violence.\n \n Another illustration was of two people trapped on a desert island, fighting over a fishing hole. Both threatened to kill one another, and so eventually decided to form a social contract. That could happen. But an equally likely alternative is that whoever is stronger or smarter will kill the other and take the fishing hole for himself. And neither situation is inherently superior to the other, for in either case society has resolved the conflict. There again is the ultimate failure of the social contract, giving fuel to violence in the one place and in the other being powerless to make any judgments about violence done. Now we come into the realm of good and bad. It was said that events can only be good or bad from the perspective of a group or individual. This is certainly not helpful to preventing violence, and is likely a conclusion drawn from our social contract reinforcement of the selfishness within. Anything I wish to do will of course be good to me. What we are looking at is far and away from the realm of running over bunnies. A man might think it good to murder, rape, and steal in whatever capacity he is able. Another man might think it bad. And the social contract says something about this situation. At first I'm inclined to think that it's neutral on such subjective moral matters, but that really isn't the case. The social contract mentality says that all these things are bad because doing them may result in reprisal; but on a deeper, more fundamental level it says that the pursuit of these things, of murdering ones' enemies, and stealing and raping to satisfy desires is a perfectly fine thing to want. It says this because, going all the way back to the beginning, it affirms human selfishness as good. So much to say, even in our great freedom we have not escaped morality, but find ourselves living a philosophy that promotes the desire for the things it forbids.\n \n On the larger scale the situation is even grimmer. If you were standing with me a few years ago in ruins of Birkenau in Poland, that death camp where so many were put into the gas chambers, I would have said that what was done there was evil. The modern humanist could not agree; from my perspective it is evil, from Hitler and Eichmann's perspectives it was good, we have freed ourselves from the burden of a universal, objective moral compass and so we cannot make any real judgment that it was good or evil outside of your perspective or mine. The logical inconsistency of that statement boggles the mind, and the sheer banality of it would send observers less detatched from the everyday world reeling. For the statement itself makes a moral judgment; it says good is subjective, therefore determined by the individual, therefore aligned with the individual's interests, and therefore selfishness is good. Morality is involved, as much as we have tried to escape it, and the morality of the social contract is one that ultimately lacks efficacy. This can be said because every violence done in human history is a testimony to the failure of the social contract in practice and an adherence to its moral teaching of self-centeredness.\n \n So it seems that there is an objective moral authority at work, which all our relativism was powerless to stop from emerging. Here is my conclusion, that the selfish morality of the social contract propels people forward to violence, and the external guards it builds in reply to this malady are ultimately ineffective. The alternative is to suppose that there is something deeper to which humans should attach themselves, some external reason whereby the wellbeing of the other becomes more important than the wellbeing of the self. An atheistic reason for this is what this thread first sought, but none have been offered. So it seems the only way to arrive upon a morality of others-centeredness would be to recant of some of our freedom from God...or escape our slavery to self (oops! Did I actually write that?! My my...). But there are too many humanistic prejudices and inhibitions that dictate we cannot consider this as an alternative. We have become thoroughly committed to naturalism, to humanism, to a malady of selfishness from which we cannot hope to emerge upon a framework for human society that does not suffer the destructive tendencies of all those theories that have logical inconsistency at the very foundation.\n \n I have said...a lot. Those who reply will likely be tempted to focus their answers on the last paragraph, and while you're welcome to comment on it I would prefer to here more in reply to the earlier segments, where I hope there was more substance for debate.",

   "\n Well, in viewing these valuable responses there are a lot of things to say, so forgive me if I miss some elements of the arguments presented.\n \n First, Mach, I'm going to have to admit that I'm not as free as you are, by your standards. I don't know how much of modern man's freedom you have embraced but it is likely more than I. Much of humanity has declared itself free from religion, from morality, from absolutes, even from logical consistency (not to accuse you of the last, but that seems to be how far our freedom has gotten). . . ..\nWhat, precisely, do you mean when you say, \"Much of humanity has declared itself free from religion, from morality, from absolutes, even from logical consistency\"? Do you have any specific examples of what you claim?\n \n \nIn starting this thread I was searching for primarily atheistic frameworks for human rights, looking for something that might prove more satisfying than the social contract theory. None have been forthcoming, but many defenders of social contracts leapt to the field; I will take this to support my initial suspicion that there are no other convincing atheistic human rights theories.\n \n In response to these delineations of social contract theory I want to level this criticism; it lacks ultimate efficacy. Social contract rights are only effective within the ability of humans to force acquiescence.\n\n My understanding of the concept of a social contract is that it something that is agreed upon, not something that is forced upon someone. I am unable to understand why \"force\" is a part of a social contract. Could this be explained?\n \n \nIn some places that ability is severely limited, and nowhere is it near perfect. The fundamental principle of this theory is that humans are selfish, and that selfishness is applauded as what maintains order.\nYou don't seem to hold the human race in much esteem. I have always been impressed by the overwhelming unselfishness and willingness to share of most of humanity, untempered by religious belief in many cases. Perhaps you associate with the wrong sort of people. \n \nBut in making this move, to not only acknowledging the obvious selfishness of humanity but to reinforcing and praising it we give full reign to the impetus behind all violence even as we strive for a humanistic method to prevent it. What I'm saying is this; selfishness is the root of violence, putting one's own desires above the wellbeing of others. The selfishness of a man is what prompts him to rape a woman, even though the experience was thoroughly degrading to her, and it is what prompts him to steal from another.\nI wonder why rape is much more prevalent in religious cultures than it is in more secular societies such as the Scandinavian nations. Could it possibly be that in nonsecular societies boys are carefully taught that girls and women are to be respected as fully human and equal rather than as less than men?\n \n \nThe social contract says \"it is in your best interest to agree to x rights\" and in doing so it says of the actions of rape and theft that they may not be done yet says of the reason for them that it is perfectly valid.\nI had absolutely no idea that the idea that rape and theft were accepted as valid actions was written into the social contract. Could you please point out the particular clause that states that?\n \n \nIs the inconsistency clear yet? In a social contract society I am told that my selfishness should keep me from killing my neighbor, because if I do I will be thrown in jail. In telling me that, it acknowledges that I am centered upon my own desire to kill this neighbor who has offended me and turns that desire into the reason I shouldn't do it, making a greater selfish desire. But my ultimate devotion to myself has been reinforced all the more so that while guards have been put in place externally--that is, outside of myself--to prevent me from committing murder the same rationale that placed them has given full sway internally to my impetus to violence.\nHuh?\n \nThat is where we see the intensely limited quality of these prohibitions. What if I am smarter than those who enforce the laws protecting human rights? Then I will commit whatever acts of violence I please, because the counterproductive logic that placed external safeguards on the rights of those I wished to harm removed the internal barracades that might have prevented me from it. That is why the social contract is powerless against all the violence in America today. The BTK killer did what he did because modern man has said there is nothing preventing you from doing violence except the force of society to stop you. . . .\nInteresting that you mentioned the BTK killer. Wasn't he the guy who was a thoroughly religious, church-going guy, a deacon in his church, the whole ball of wax? How come his religiously moral upbringing didn't stop the guy from murdering women? Seems to me that many of the serial killers who kill women are extremely religious folk, which leads me to wonder if Christianity doesn't have an underlying theme of disrespect for women. That certainly should not be written into the social contract. And, if religion is a factor in violence against women, maybe religion should be written out of the social contract. I shouldn't like to forbid religion because it is very, very important to many people but, my goodness, if it leads to hating women in such a way that one is motivated to hunt them down like animals, well!",

   ". . . . We see so much gun violence, and what is the proposed cure? Make guns harder to come by. Granted, without guns there isn't gun violence, and don't rip this out of context and say I'm advocating we sell AK-47s beside the magazine racks in grocery stores--but would it not prove ultimately more effective if there were something society reinforced within the minds of its members that prompted less selfishness? This, I would like to suggest is where morality meets human rights.\nDo people own guns out of selfishness? Or, out of fear?\n \nTo borrow an illustration from the esteemed Mach, what does the social contract do for a man who wants to shoot a kid? It takes his gun away and puts him in prison (or chains him to a tree). Granted, there is nothing to be applauded here that he does not shoot the kid. Rather, it truly is his choice that makes a difference to our estimation of him when he is free to act. But I see this example as saying perhaps the opposite of what it intended. It is the social contract theory that chains him so he is not free to act as he chooses, and rightly so in order to prevent anarchy. But the social contract theory is not neutral in regard to influencing his choice, for it grooms in him the selfishness that first made him think it was okay to shoot the kid, so on the one hand it chains him and on the other it propels him forth to violence.\nA man who wants to shoot a kid. A man, just out of the blue, wants to shoot a kid. Are there truly such men?\n \n If there are, why are there such men? Are they insane? Are they afraid of kids? I cannot see that a man would just randomly out of the blue go around shooting kids because he is \"selfish.\"\n \n \nAnother illustration was of two people trapped on a desert island, fighting over a fishing hole. Both threatened to kill one another, and so eventually decided to form a social contract.\nTwo people trapped on a desert island. One fishing hole.\n \n I'd kind of like to know how close to the coast these people were. If they were on the coast, seems to me that they would have the vast ocean spread before them promising all sorts of food and fish. Likely there would be little edible critters that exist between the land and sea offering themselves up as tasty food, if one chose the right critters. Seems to me that a lot of cooperative societies purposely lived on or near the coastlines simply because there were so many goodies to devour on a coastline.\n \n Now, a more realistic example could be the possible example of the recent tragedy in Sago mine. There is speculation that the 12 or 13 miners trapped decided amongst themselves to offer up their oxygen supply to the one who was probably the youngest, the most likely to survive, and the parent of a hopeful and needy family. If that is truly what happened, what prompted these doomed miners to behave in such a way? That's something I'd really like to speculate about. And, admittedly, there is a Christian context which may have played a part in their decision, if such a decision was what they made.\n \n \nThat could happen. But an equally likely alternative is that whoever is stronger or smarter will kill the other and take the fishing hole for himself. And neither situation is inherently superior to the other, for in either case society has resolved the conflict. There again is the ultimate failure of the social contract, giving fuel to violence in the one place and in the other being powerless to make any judgments about violence done. Now we come into the realm of good and bad. It was said that events can only be good or bad from the perspective of a group or individual. This is certainly not helpful to preventing violence, and is likely a conclusion drawn from our social contract reinforcement of the selfishness within. Anything I wish to do will of course be good to me. What we are looking at is far and away from the realm of running over bunnies. A man might think it good to murder, rape, and steal in whatever capacity he is able. Another man might think it bad. And the social contract says something about this situation. At first I'm inclined to think that it's neutral on such subjective moral matters, but that really isn't the case. The social contract mentality says that all these things are bad because doing them may result in reprisal; but on a deeper, more fundamental level it says that the pursuit of these things, of murdering ones' enemies, and stealing and raping to satisfy desires is a perfectly fine thing to want. It says this because, going all the way back to the beginning, it affirms human selfishness as good. So much to say, even in our great freedom we have not escaped morality, but find ourselves living a philosophy that promotes the desire for the things it forbids.\nThis is a huge clump of stuff that has to be deconstructed separately and later.\n \n \nOn the larger scale the situation is even grimmer. If you were standing with me a few years ago in ruins of Birkenau in Poland, that death camp where so many were put into the gas chambers, I would have said that what was done there was evil. The modern humanist could not agree;. . . .\nHow is it that you can claim to speak for the \"modern humanist\"? Can you name one specific \"modern humanist,\" whatever that might be, who has stated that what happened at the death camp in Birkenau was not evil?\n \n Who are the folks who deny that such events are not evil, that they never happened? Are they \"modern humanists\"? Perhaps we ought to look at the background and character of such folks to find out what they are and what they espouse. And, I'll bet I'm safe in saying that they aren't \"modern humanists,\" whatever that is.\n \n From Wikipedia:\n \n \nIn addition, most Holocaust denial implies, or openly states, that the current mainstream understanding of the Holocaust is the result of a deliberate Jewish conspiracy. For this reason, Holocaust denial is considered by some as an antisemitic conspiracy theory. Because of this, Holocaust denial is also illegal in a number of European countries, as their governments hold that it is motivated by an antisemitic and anti-democratic agenda.\n \n Most historians and scholars reject Holocaust denial as \"grounded in hatred, rather than any accepted standards of assertion, evidence, and truth\" and a \"pseudoscience\" that \"rejects the entire foundation of historical evidence,\" instead motivated by a \"blatantly racist\" ideology.\n \n While some Holocaust deniers are bona fide historians (degreed), some of their most prominent representatives have been shown in court to have a pattern of falsifying historical documents (e.g. David Irving) or deliberately misrepresenting historical data (e.g. Ernst Z\u00fcndel). This history of Holocaust deniers distorting, ignoring, or misusing historical records has led to almost universal condemnation of the techniques and conclusions of Holocaust denial, with organizations such as the American Historical Association, the largest society of historians in the United States, stating that Holocaust denial is \"at best, a form of academic fraud.\"\nIt seems evident that such folks are racist, anti-Semite, liars, and so forth. There is no indication that they are \"modern humanists,\" whatever that is.",

   "The two past responses by Simone demonstrate beautifully the sort of thread-derailing bunny trails that can crop up when someone replies to one post without having referred to the earlier ones. A great many things are taken out of context and issues are brought up that, while legitimate points of discussion, do nothing to contribute to the debate in this thread. I am going to respond to these various off-track assertions, but I discourage anyone but Simone from reading this post, as it has little to do with the topic of this thread. Please, let's continue this thread with replies to my last post that take the arguments it includes in the context of the previous posts from the beginning, not as though they were just thrown out by themselves. Other concerns, such as the various topics raised by Simone, should be given new threads if anyone desires to debate them.\n \n \nWhat, precisely, do you mean when you say, \"Much of humanity has declared itself free from religion, from morality, from absolutes, even from logical consistency\"? Do you have any specific examples of what you claim?\n\n Hmm...let's see...why don't you read something by Nietzsche, and the 'God is dead' movement that sprang from his thought? The comments on freedom are in the context of Mach's assertion that only a free person should explore this issue. If you don't know anyone who considers themself free from religion I suggest that you live in a bubble. Obvious Child and epaphras faith have been taking a few shots at the issue of absolutes, from which I infer that OC considers himself free. As for logical consistency, I take this whole forum to be filled with examples of that. Have you encountered noone here who doesn't seem to feel obligated to be logically consistent? But all of these things are merely subsidiaries; the point of the statement was that there are some things I don't wish to be free of, such as the commitment to a logically consistent worldview, therefore freedom itself is not necessarily something to be applauded.\n \n \nMy understanding of the concept of a social contract is that it something that is agreed upon, not something that is forced upon someone. I am unable to understand why \"force\" is a part of a social contract. Could this be explained?\n\n In the previous posts it was detailed to the effect that the social contracts we have are agreed upon only on the basis of force; people only make them because the other party has sufficient force to cause conflict and rather than that conflict they make the contract. But force is clearly what keeps the contract as well; supposing a social contract forbids stealing (because no one wants to be stolen from)? Yet people still wish to steal, otherwise there would have been no need for the contract in the first place. So it is the force of society to impose consequences on those who break the contract that maintain its integrity. If it is anything else keeping people from stealing then it is no longer the social contract but some other morality at work.\n \n \nQuote:\n Originally Posted by Quardon7\n In some places that ability is severely limited, and nowhere is it near perfect.

I have always been impressed by the overwhelming unselfishness and willingness to share of most of humanity, untempered by religious belief in many cases. Perhaps you associate with the wrong sort of people.\n\n \n In the first place, my statement about the selfishness and applause of it was not expressing my view but the view that I see implied by the social contract, as the post expresses. You can find the promotion of selfishness elsewhere, such as in a recent paper I read by someone on one of the other forum sections here; I can go find it for you if you don't know what I'm talking about.\n In the second place, I don't know where you live but we clearly do have different experiences with people if you think they are generally unselfish. Let's see, I live in America, surrounded by wealthy people in huge houses...and there are people starving all over the world. The powerful nations stood by and did nothing while genocide was going on in Rwanda, and now we do little enough for Darfur. Big corporations go to other nations to exploit child labor and cheat the people in order to make a profit. Maybe your friends share their possessions with you, maybe you live in a generally hospitable city, but anyone with a globally-conscious worldview would have a hard time thinking people are generally unselfish.\n \n \nI wonder why rape is much more prevalent in religious cultures than it is in more secular societies such as the Scandinavian nations. Could it possibly be that in nonsecular societies boys are carefully taught that girls and women are to be respected as fully human and equal rather than as less than men?\n\n 1. If I were you, I would immediately demand that you give specific references for the claims you make about the prevalence of rape. But that would not be conducive to debate unless I wished to actively dispute the claim, in which case I would take the initiative by giving specific examples of why it is not so. Just a thought about considerate debate tactics.\n 2. This comment may be perfectly in line with your agenda, but it has nothing to do with the topic of this thread\n 3. In every religious setting I have ever been in I have been taught that \"girls and women are to be respected as fully human and equal rather than less than men.\" You are dealing with a strawman stereotype. If you have a bone with religion it does you no credit to pick on bad examples of religion, you should be attacking those whose deeds are in keeping with the teachings of their religion. This topic of women is one of great debate theologically, and deserves a thread of its own if you want to argue that religions denegrate women. Some do, some don't, and your going to have to make a much more detailed argument to get where you want. But don't make it on this thread.\n \n \nQuote:\n Originally Posted by Quardon7\n The social contract says \"it is in your best interest to agree to x rights\" and in doing so it says of the actions of rape and theft that they may not be done yet says of the reason for them that it is perfectly valid. \n \n I had absolutely no idea that the idea that rape and theft were accepted as valid actions was written into the social contract. Could you please point out the particular clause that states that?\n\n The social contract we are dealing with is the concept of basing human rights upon the agreement of humans without any moral basis for these rights. If you had read the previous posts that should have been abundantly clear; there is no document in which to identify clauses. Further, you failed to grasp the point of that statement. Rape and theft are not valid actions--and I did not say that they were in the social contract; I said it is the selfishness that is the underlying motivation for them that the social contract makes valid.\n \n \nHuh?\n\n I don't know what anyone can say in reply to that. Read the whole thread from the beginning, slowly and carefully, don't make assumptions and pull things out of context, and it should all be coherent. You may not agree, but it has the logical consistency to be grasped by the mind.\n \n \nInteresting that you mentioned the BTK killer. Wasn't he the guy who was a thoroughly religious, church-going guy, a deacon in his church, the whole ball of wax? How come his religiously moral upbringing didn't stop the guy from murdering women? Seems to me that many of the serial killers who kill women are extremely religious folk, which leads me to wonder if Christianity doesn't have an underlying theme of disrespect for women.

I shouldn't like to forbid religion because it is very, very important to many people but, my goodness, if it leads to hating women in such a way that one is motivated to hunt them down like animals, well!\n\n 1. Yet again you are completely off-topic. There are existent threads where you can express assertions that religious people are immoral.\n 2. Yet again you mention the social contract as if it's a piece of paper. We are talking about a theory for understanding human rights.\n 3. I do not know what the religious status of the BTK killer was. However, if he was a Christian he certainly did not follow the teachings of Christ--that stuff about love and charity, you know? That would make him a FAKE Christian. If you wish to join a thread attacking religious people, be sure you do not fallaciously assert that those who did bad stuff did it because they were religious while demonstrating that what they did contradicted their religion. Remember what was said about people not feeling obligated to logical consistency? This argument of yours you may take as the specific example you desired.\n \n \nDo people own guns out of selfishness? Or, out of fear?\n\n People own guns for any number of reasons. I suggest that you have again misinterpreted what was being said. If not, please restate what it is you are trying to say.\n \n \nA man who wants to shoot a kid. A man, just out of the blue, wants to shoot a kid. Are there truly such men?\n \n If there are, why are there such men? Are they insane? Are they afraid of kids? I cannot see that a man would just randomly out of the blue go around shooting kids because he is \"selfish.\"\n\n These questions are completely irrelevant if the illustration was taken in context. The point was that it is precisely the man's willfull decision that we applaud or abhor, not the presence or absence of the chains of a social contract. It was not originally my illustration, but Mach's which I wished to reverse. If you have problems with the theoretical situation (which was perfectly plausible, if taken in context) you may bring them to Mach's attention.\n \n \nTwo people trapped on a desert island. One fishing hole.\n \n I'd kind of like to know how close to the coast these people were. If they were on the coast, seems to me that they would have the vast ocean spread before them promising all sorts of food and fish. Likely there would be little edible critters that exist between the land and sea offering themselves up as tasty food, if one chose the right critters. Seems to me that a lot of cooperative societies purposely lived on or near the coastlines simply because there were so many goodies to devour on a coastline.\n\n Once again Mach's illustration, which makes sense in context. Once again you either completely missed the point or chose to ignore it.\n \n \n \nNow, a more realistic example could be the possible example of the recent tragedy in Sago mine. There is speculation that the 12 or 13 miners trapped decided amongst themselves to offer up their oxygen supply to the one who was probably the youngest, the most likely to survive, and the parent of a hopeful and needy family. If that is truly what happened, what prompted these doomed miners to behave in such a way? That's something I'd really like to speculate about. And, admittedly, there is a Christian context which may have played a part in their decision, if such a decision was what they made.\n\n Finally something that has bearing on the topic!!! With this you may proceed; was it more likely that they did so because of a social contract or altruism? Was their decision good? What does that mean for our society?\n \n \nHow is it that you can claim to speak for the \"modern humanist\"? Can you name one specific \"modern humanist,\" whatever that might be, who has stated that what happened at the death camp in Birkenau was not evil?\n\n On this I speak only what I have heard, and its logical implications. Mach said that a person runs over a bunny; one thinks it morally bad, another might not. This is the tenet of subjective morality, no one has the authority to make such judgments. But I disagree, and that is why I brought the discussion to where it matters. When we talk about morality what's important is Birkenau, not a bunny. And the logical implications of what was said by (SPECIFICALLY!!!!!!!) Mach, and seemingly supported by Obvious Child and Zardoz was that Birkanau was not evil; I may think so but Hitler didn't, so we cannot make an absolute judgment on it. That is the implication of what they were promoting.\n Yet they did not say \"what was done in Birkenau was not evil;\" in fact, they said nothing. I should hope they would not say that. But I don't see how they can say it was evil without allowing for the existence of objective morality. That is the point. And if you don't believe that the modern humanist--the contemporary average man who takes a Darwinian outlook--is not morally relativistic then I would encourage you to read some other philosophy threads...such as the ones arguing against objective morality.\n \n \n \nWho are the folks who deny that such events are not evil, that they never happened? Are they \"modern humanists\"? Perhaps we ought to look at the background and character of such folks to find out what they are and what they espouse. And, I'll bet I'm safe in saying that they aren't \"modern humanists,\" whatever that is.\n\n 1. You have erroneously inferred that we are talking about people who deny that the holocaust happened. We are talking about people who realize it happened but (because they do not hold to objective morality) have lost the ability to meaningfully say that it was evil.\n 2. To clear up your confusion, I would suggest you go back to wikipedia. Look up \"modern\" or \"contemporary\" or any other such synonym. Then look up \"humanist.\" Put the two together. You should get a fair picture that describes a good many people.",

   "Simone:\n Another example of logical inconsistency. You say:\n \n \nEvil is evil and good is good.\n\n Here you posit an objective standpoint, asserting that these things are what they are, regardless of an individual's view on them. People may view good and evil through their individual lenses, but nonetheless there is some defining quality outside of people that makes good good and evil evil. This, however, stands in complete contrast to:\n \n \nHow much meaningful can one be? How does one say meaningfully that something is evil\"?

There can be no answer to this, because whatever is meaningful to me may not be to someone else, so in essence the standard of meaningfulness becomes meaningless, it cannot have any clout in attempting to understand reality.\n \n You cannot have it both ways. If there is something objective in good being good and evil being evil, then there is something objective in saying something is meaningful; \"altruism is good\" is a meaningful statement. If, however, meaning is entirely based on a subjective standard then the statement translates \"hooray!\" It is an expression of personal feelings, the objectivism of the \"good\" moral quality and of the \"meaningful\" objective property have both departed together.\n \n One must decide where she/he stands on this. You clearly have expressed a view that evil and good exist in an objective manner; bigotry and oppression are evil regardless of what a person thinks of them. Mach could not agree. But if you are going to take a position in contrast to him and those in the same camp you need two things:\n 1. You need to bring the rest of your beliefs in line with the objectivism of these moral beliefs. \"What is your subjective standard of meaningfulness?\" is not a question consistent with objective morals. Rather, you should be asking, \"what is your subjective assessment of the objective state of meaningfulness?\" (meaning, how do I understand meaningfulness--which you must believe to be a real, objective quality).\n 2. You need to find some foundation to ground these objective morals in. Having rejected God, I think you are going to have a tough time of it. Frankly I have never encountered a convincing atheistic framework for objective morality; and I think most of the posters on this forum would agree, and that is why the atheists are arguing that there is no such thing as evil outside of one's subjective standards. But you need something there. Good and evil cannot just be floating on their own...although some have tried to make philosophical arguments in favor of that, I suggest that they fall prey to defenses based on subjective assertion, thereby undermining their own objectivist stance.",

   "A lofty statement is made in the Internet Dictionary of Philosophy regarding conceptural naturalism:\n \nThe principal objective of conceptual (or analytic) jurisprudence has traditionally been to provide an account of what distinguishes law as a system of norms from other systems of norms, such as ethical norms. As John Austin describes the project, conceptual jurisprudence seeks \"the essence or nature which is common to all laws that are properly so called\" (Austin 1995, 11). Accordingly, the task of conceptual jurisprudence is to provide a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of law that distinguishes law from non-law in every possible world.\nAgain, I cringe at such statements, inasmuch as such statements are made by white males with a narrow education in western thought exclusively, totally devoid of the entire world of experience and history and thought which is far vaster than the narrow world of European existence.",

   "perhaps man doesnt have rights per say\n\n No indeed? :) I'm inclined to agree. Thus far this thread has demonstrated that atheistic systems of thought cannot justify a doctrine of natural rights. It is possible that theistic thought systems could, but I would argue that they should not, since doing so would push them into an anthropocentric (rather than theocentric) worldview; and in the case of Christianity, whatever the founding fathers (of America) might have thought, there is no evidence for the Creator endowing man with \"certain inalienable rights.\" Quite the opposite, the Creator has invested in man certain inalienable responsibilities--which we commonly understand as morality. This is the final stage of where I wish to point to, and you have gotten ahead of me because I was stuck waiting for the defenders of social contract theory to rescue it from my indictment that it promotes an arbitrary moral code based on selfishness, and thus promotes violence.\n \n \nman is part of a community, we are no different from the community, trying to establish what is right to us...what we deserve...what we are owed...is a search for nothing at all\n we are like everyother creature on the planet. we live to live and take part in what is around us. Looking for what we deserve is selfish and pointless.\n\n \n Here I suggest that you run into trouble. In the statement \"we are like every other creature on the planet...\" I infer that you are espousing naturalism, and I see a couple of references to vacuousness and pointlessness. But then you state that \"looking for what we deserve is selfish and pointless.\" It does not need to be said that searching for rights is selfish in a factual sense, that would be redundant--so that statement can only be understood as making a value judgment, that it is \"selfish and pointless\" and that is bad. But in the naturalistic worldview I don't see how you can substantiate that moral judgment. What's wrong with pursuing something selfish? That's only wrong if there is something very right about being self-less. And there is...but believing that may cost you your naturalism, may obligate you to posit a moral law-giver who is the objective basis for these value judgments. Now let's take a look at your catchy quote:\n \n \nWar.Rape.Murder.Poverty.Equal rights for gays.Guess which one the Southern Baptist Convention is protesting?\n\n \n What's this? Do my eyes decieve me, or is it a stated approval of a rights concept? And right after you said running after such things was pointless. Do you see how this might make me suspicious of your ethos, might hint at some incoherence in your views?",

Perhaps, to check it out, you should read on the work of Hans Kelsen, Ross, Hart or Olivecrona, some of the major positivists. None the less, I have also googled the term I gave you in English, and found, in Wikipedia, the following:\n \n \nLegal positivism is a school of thought in modern and contemporary jurisprudence and the philosophy of law. The principal claims of legal positivism are:\n \n that laws are rules made by human beings; and \n that there is no inherent or necessary connection between law and morality. \n \n Legal positivism stands in opposition to various contrary ideas in the tradition of natural law, a body of legal theory asserting that there is an essential connection between law and justice. Legal positivism incorporates the separation thesis: the idea that legal validity has no essential connection with morality or justice.\n\n \n Do you consider minimally coherent a theory that claims there is no necessary connection between law and justice?\n \n With respect to your amusing and convenient (yet grossly unfounded and exaggerated) conspiracy theories of history involving the relationship between Hitler and the Holy Catholic Church, perhaps you should recheck some sources of history that are not necessarily too attatched to any agenda. No, Hitler was not a Roman Catholic (even if he would have been one, we would probably be qualified as the worst Catholic ever). In fact, in Mein Kampf, he openly attacks religion stating it is little more than a mere means of controlling the people. If you check any mildly objective and scientifically elaborated list of the peoples that were slaughtered by the Nazis in their killing camps, you will find that very many were Catholic priests. Also, if you care to visit St. Peter's Basilica in Rome someday, you will find (if you search well), an inscription which conmemorates all the ministers of the Church that were killed for their adherence to their faith and to Rome in Nazi Germany and in other totalitarian regimes, like the Communist ones. This inscription was commissioned by H.H. Pope Pius XII.\n \n \nDo you, perchance, have access to some historical commentary on the resurging of the doctrine of \"natural law\" in the face of the savage excesses of the Nazi regime?

Also, you could read some authors, like Del Vecchio or Villey, modern thinkers that call for a return to natural law, as it was understood by the Roman jurists, Aristotle and St. Thomas Aquinas.",

Thank you.\n\n \n According to Gibbon's celebrated aphorism:\n \n \"History is little more than a register of the crimes, follies, and misfortunes of mankind\".\n \n Reflecting on this view of recorded history, it does not seem unduly cynical to claim that Hobbes got it right in his account of human nature. The unchanging and selfish desires of humanity, the war of every man against every man, are the 'natural reality'. And though natural law may have the authority, it does not have the power to enforce its ordinances.\n \n This is why, for the sake of justice and security, every society must establish a civil and criminal law administered by the state or the sovereign. People must be coerced in order to be law-abiding: they will not obey the theoretical commandments of the natural law.",

Why should we endeavour to protect a group of individuals that are inclined to do evil? Where is the value of the human person if he is naturally inclined to do evil? The idea that we must respect each other lies in the respect for what we are (more than whom we are). If we are naturally evil creatures then there is no philosophical argument that can sufficiently or satisfactorily favour the continuation of society or of the human race, for that matter. In the end, following Hobbes, war is natural but it is also something good, because if history is a mere repetition of evil, then that very evil is good because it purifies the creatures that create it. There is a profound logical error in this line of thought.\n \n The idea Hobbes give of justice is also inadequate. Because claiming that humanity is in constant war against itself, justice is not to stop that war and provide for peace (because, according to our nature, that peace is unattainable), but it would be to destroy everything that is unjust, in other words, us.",

It is to the credit of Hobbes that his realism had little use for a theory of intrinsic human benevolence: he saw that 'original anarchy' is covered by a mere facade of order, and that coercive pressure is always needed to keep the lid on human passions. \n \n I'm not sure that it matters whether the continuation of any human society can be favoured by one philosophical argument rather than another. Empirical data (from the observation of humanity over many centuries) strongly suggests that man is indeed inclined to do evil rather than good. We might associate this inclination with the 'fundamental truth' - that reason is passion's slave.\n \n Nature is always with us, and, in principle, it is possible to have people who are perennially primitive. Even in the sophisticated cultures that we suppose ourselves to inhabit, glimpses of the world of Hobbes occur. \n \n Apart from the obvious examples, of wars, cruelties, terrorism, etc., there is also the Hobbesian world of 'mass man'. I'm talking here about the destructive phenomenon of mass culture that stamps the character of modern life, and which is analysed so brilliantly by Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset.",
