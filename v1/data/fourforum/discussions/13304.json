Don't be so gullable. emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n By both sides? How so? What is deceptive in the message that same sex couples want to marry? What is the big deception? Jeez.....\n \n \n Tikkun Magazine - Historic Election: Obama and Prop. 8 By Lynice Pinkard\n \n One of the indicators that racism is still at work in our culture is the way in which some mainstream media reports have insinuated that black voters were somehow centrally responsible for the passage of California's Proposition 8 to ban gay marriage. This is a classic case of scapegoating, in which disproportionate attention is being paid to the black voters targeted by a massive homophobic outreach program, rather than to the mostly white institutions and funders behind that outreach program. Thankfully the New Yorker helped to clarify the situation in a December 1 article: \"If exit polling is to be believed, seventy percent of California's African American voters did indeed vote yes on Prop. 8, as did upward of eighty percent of Republicans, conservatives, white evangelicals, and weekly churchgoers. But the initiative would have passed, barely, even if not a single African American had shown up at the polls.\"\n \n Nevertheless, it was sobering to see how many African American voters cast ballots in favor of the measure. The \"Yes on 8\" campaign targeted African American communities very successfully in large part because of the effects of a racist society on sexuality and gender roles in those communities. Talking about sexuality at all in African American contexts, and especially African American church contexts, is deeply problematic because of the history of the denigration of black bodies in this country through enslavement, rape and accusations of rape, lynchings, and on and on. This discussion becomes even more loaded because of the ways that traditional gender roles have been inscribed in the empowerment of black families. The emasculation of black men in a racist society-their inability to really protect their families, to provide for their families-has resulted in strict gender roles that often play out as male dominance and female subordination. Anything that seems to interrogate these gender norms-the feminization of men, the masculinization of women-is threatening. In this way, African American homophobia is in part the effect of racism.\n \n Homophobia among white working-class people is similarly an effect of class oppression, although it is important to note that oppression plays out differently among different groups. African American people have borne the full weight of the imperialist system in a way that people of the dominant culture have not. Because of that, it is revolutionary for African American people to fight homophobia and heterosexism in ways that it isn't for people in the dominant culture.\n \n This is not to deny the suffering of white people who struggle to provide for their own families and may use homophobia and heterosexism as a way of defining themselves as strong and worthy in opposition to a demonized \"other.\" Although oppression plays out differently for different groups, oppression tends to replicate itself as oppressed people oppress others. The only answer to the endless pecking order of isms is for all suffering people to enter into solidarity with each other to fight for the liberation of all and the flourishing of all life.\n \n That means LGBTQ activists would get into solidarity with other suffering people to address not only the denial of the right of all to marry, but also the myriad other forms that domination takes. This means transcending self-interests to create authentic bonds of solidarity across lines of difference.\n \n What does this look like? Here I think we can take some cues from what Obama did in his campaign. He used his deep exposure across many lines of difference to connect with the suffering of many different communities. Likewise, at First Congregational Church of Oakland, where I serve as senior pastor, we are engaging in intercultural work in an attempt to connect our own suffering with the suffering of all people everywhere. In this way we are struggling to recognize that the source of that suffering is an interconnected system or network of systems that create overarching structures of domination. When we address single issues that emerge from our own narrow self-interest, we are in essence pulling at the individual straps of the boot of domination, without recognizing the entirety of the boot that is holding us all down.\n \n What are you to do if you are a white LGBTQ activist who genuinely wants to work against \"the whole boot\" in this way? If you want to build bridges to the African American community, start with your genuine care for the suffering of African American people. Let that compassion lead you into genuine relationships with African American LGBTQ activists who have been disenfranchised in the same ways as other members of the African American community. African American LGBTQs can traverse the full length of the bridge between LGBTQ concerns and African American concerns and can introduce you to other African Americans who are not gay. Work with this larger community of African Americans on the issues that directly affect their lives as a way to build real, authentic relationships. Through these relationships, everyone involved is transformed and made capable of entering into solidarity, even when their self-interest is not immediately served. This process leads to a broadened understanding of what liberation means-it is universal or it's nothing. This is the only way to create broad-based capacity for sustainable change.\n \n This is what we are seeking to model by building our own alternative, intercultural community here at First Congregational Church of Oakland. We are allowing genuine bonds of commitment to transform all of us and build our capacity to work against all forms of domination and oppression. Then we are using what we learn here to do the same thing in the various communities in which we live and work.",
