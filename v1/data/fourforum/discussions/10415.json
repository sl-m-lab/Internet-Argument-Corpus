True, the government chooses what it will buy with the money we all contribute to the purse. The government is expected to buy us roads and bridges. Government takes labor which must be paid. Government of a superpower like the US requires a large military. In all cases, the government is spending from a pile of citizen's money and buying things that benefit the citizens.

(Hint: Yes)\n \n Have you not heard of her plan to force everyone to buy health insurance? Have you not heard of her plan to give every newborn American $5000? (Boy, this will get a lot of late term aliens to cross the border. Not only do they get to have an anchor baby in the US, they get an instant 5 grand.) With the latter, she's merely pandering to the welfare whores who have babies for profit.\n \n \n\n No Jim, it's based on one statement provided for you by someone who, you yourself demonstrated, is willing to lie.

The fact that both sides round up numbers is not astounding. (7.886 to 8 is not a ridiculous round-up) The fact that she and others claim the full number without extracting the ones that are NOT AMERICANS makes it a lie. The fact that they do not extract the ones actually capable of buying their own insurance points to their being deliberately misleading, but not necessarily lying.\n \n \n\n Snopes did a great job of showing your last dig at Clinton to be bogus.

You do not solve that by sticking people on a subsidized HMO. You solve that by going head to head with the health care industry. You take away the AMAs certification authority and give it to the FDA. You remove the health care exemption from racketeering laws, and you mandate single price policies (so the lab work that costs one person $7 costs the next person $7, too, as opposed to the way it is now, where if you are insured it is $7 total cost, and if you are uninsured it is $90).\n \n Just doing that....treating health care like every other industry, would halve our health care costs. \n \n Then we stop paying R&D costs for the pharmaceutical companies so they cna turn around and gouge us. Patents that came from publicly funded research used to autmatically be public domain. You cold not have the federal government pay millions in R&D costs and then claim exclusive use of the fruits of that reasearch. You have to admit there is a certain logic there. The public pays for the research, the public should own the results. \n \n Not only should we do that going forward, we should also pull the patents and place in the public domain all currently protected medication that was developed using public money. \n \n Since the cost difference between name brand drugs that are still under patent and their generic counterparts that pop up as soon as they come off patent is typically 500%, that move should net a MAJOR savings when it comes to prescription drugs, since 80-90% of R&D costs for new drugs are paid not by the companies that ultimatly benifit from them, but by the federal government through NIH grants.",

   " \n Are you staggering in disbelief that Hillary actually has these plans? \n\n No, I'm stating flat out that you are so desperate to believe any bad thing you hear about Clinton that you have no actual idea what her plans are. I'm quite sure that all you know, or want to know, are the distortions that you've been fed. \n \n \n \n No cigar. She and others have used the 47 million number without modification in their arguments for socialized medicine. The fact that both sides round up numbers is not astounding. (7.886 to 8 is not a ridiculous round-up) The fact that she and others claim the full number without extracting the ones that are NOT AMERICANS makes it a lie. \n\n And case in point. She quotes actual numbers, but because the one sentence fed to you does provide all the details you'd like, you label her a liar.\n \n \n \n It did nothing of the sort. It gave its opinion regarding the full text from which the words she spoke were quoted. It did not successfully argue that she is not exhibiting socialist values. \n\n And another case in point. It thuroughly showed that the quotes were taken out of context or edited to skew what was said. If having read the full text, if you actually did, you choose not to see that obvious truth, that's your choice.",

   "\nNo, I'm stating flat out that you are so desperate to believe any bad thing you hear about Clinton that you have no actual idea what her plans are. I'm quite sure that all you know, or want to know, are the distortions that you've been fed. \nYour tactic will not work here. While true that I have not read word for word, her plan, I have listened to and read many paragraphs about it. \n \n \n\n And case in point. She quotes actual numbers, but because the one sentence fed to you does provide all the details you'd like, you label her a liar.\nShe quoted the total number of people who have no insurance...not the total number of people who cannot afford insurance.\n \n \n\n And another case in point. It thuroughly showed that the quotes were taken out of context or edited to skew what was said. If having read the full text, if you actually did, you choose not to see that obvious truth, that's your choice.\n...and as I responded last time, it did not, even when acknowledging the snipping, make a case that she is not a socialist.\n \n \nOk, so do you have anything solid to back that up? I know Jim doesn't, but i'd like to hear what you have in the way of details.\n\n (bolding is mine.)\n \n http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1662655,00.html\n Instead, Clinton's new plan achieves universal coverage by imposing an \"individual mandate\" - a requirement that those who do not get coverage from their employers go out and purchase it themselves - but also by offering tax breaks and other incentives to make that affordable. It would be financed in part by eliminating President Bush's tax cuts for wealthier Americans.\n \n {the tax cuts were for all Americans, not just wealthy ones}\n .....\n \n Ironically, although the Clinton plan looks very much like the one that Mitt Romney signed into law for Massachusetts when he was Governor of that state, the Republican candidate blasted it Monday as \"bad medicine.\" As a presidential contender, he has distanced himself from the Massachusetts program, which is proving costlier and more difficult to implement than advertised. He also says that what works for an individual state may not work nationally. \"A one-size-fits-all national health care system is bound to fail,\" Romney said in introducing his plan last month.\n \n \n \n \n http://www.hillaryclinton.com/feature/healthcareplan/americanhealthchoicesplan.pdf\n This is a biased Hillary site continuing the claim that 47 million American are not insured. It paints the whole 47 million (and 10 million who fear they may lose their coverage) as being unable to buy insurance without government help.\n \n Bull-on-E!\n \n \n \n \n http://ezraklein.typepad.com/blog/2007/09/the-hillary-pla.html\n Clinton's plan is of the \"individual mandate\" variety, in which universal coverage is achieved by mandating that every American purchase health care. In order to ensure that that's both possible and affordable, the Clinton plan creates a few new coverage options, reform the insurance industry, limits coverage costs to a percentage of income, and washes your car.\n \n The comments under this article are interesting, too.",
