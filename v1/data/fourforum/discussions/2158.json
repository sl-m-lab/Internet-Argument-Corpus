   "New turn of oil war is going to be. It sounds as headline in the news papers when one wrights about mafia war. But everyone wants to live and rule. So as the Kurds. Kurds preparing to attack Baku-Ceyhan pipeline. They have another two reasons to do it. First of all they don wanna Turkey to feed itself from the cheap Caspian oil and thus boost its army expenses to further upgrade it. And certainly they wanna a real profit for themselves. They wanna sell Mosul oil for a good price themselves. And also they wanna spite Turks. And I can tell you more, most likely terrorist acts will be organized on the Georgian territory. 'Course the country is still very weak after the US activities that led the to the interior conflicts and disorders. Last explosion in Tbilisi can confirm the fact. They couldn't even protect foreigners in Georgia. And will never be able to protect the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline. So Georgia is the most convenient place to bomb. And also it's time to. No one could prevent Kurds to realise their aim. Neither Turkey nor the USA. They do what they wanna do 'course they have broken all the ties with Americans.",
