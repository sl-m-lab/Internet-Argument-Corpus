   "Greetings, all. It's been quite some time since I've posted on this forum and it may have been another long while if it weren't for some interesting circumstances in my family. To state it briefly, my sister recently \"came out\" as a christian in an otherwise atheist family. She did so in letter form and stated her feelings and reasons for her decision. We've all looked at it as an opportunity to open a dialogue about beliefs and reason and what follows is my first response to one of the specific \"problems\" she assigned to atheism. We've all heard it before: atheism is not a logically defensible position since you must be omnipotent to prove there is no god anywhere in the universe. \n \n I know, in the end, that it won't matter what I write to her since reason is typically hopeless if the face of belief, but I thought it would be an interesting exercise to get a little more mileage out of these thoughts on this forum. There's been some editing to protect the innocent, but it's otherwise as I first wrote it...\n \n \n\n Atheism (cue Darth Vader music). What is it? Semantic games aside (we'll get to those), an atheist is someone who does not believe in God (or any gods for that matter). This much is obvious. However, when you start looking closer, you might see some different varieties of atheists - \"weak atheists,\" who might also be called agnostics - and \"strong atheists,\" who would be more likely to say that there absolutely is no God, period. Now these aren't strict categories, like Protestant or Catholic, but they help us realize that atheism comes in different flavors (like Godless Grape or Sacrilicious Sherbet), which makes it difficult for any argument to pin down atheism by definition alone. So when someone says \"atheism doesn't make sense because the word 'atheist' means this...\" it's not really addressing atheism, or atheists, just a particular definition of a word. \n \n Even so, let's look at that exact claim: \"'Atheism' literally means 'no god' and that doesn't make sense since you can't prove a negative without being omnipotent.\" First, as has been pointed out, this isn't really the modern usage of the word (which is more like \"without belief in a god\"), but how can one interpret a word except by how it's used? If a word has multiple uses and definitions, which exactly is the \"right\" one? We'll stay away from this slippery semantic slope though, and take the claim at face value: atheism means no God. Can this position be proven? Nope. You can't prove a negative. No one in this family can make the absolute claim that \"there is no God of any kind anywhere.\" But this is a dangerous road for the believer to go down, because just as we can't claim that there absolutely is no deity, neither can they claim that there absolutely is (even if the clouds parted and giant guy with a white beard did a cannonball into the ocean, how could we absolutely know it's not just advanced aliens playing mind games with us?). So if the atheist can't call him/herself an atheist simply on logical grounds, then neither can a theist call him/herself a theist for the same reason. Then we'd all live in the gray goo of agnosticism and nobody would be sure of anything.\n \n Thankfully, though, we don't live in a world where absolute proof is necessary to make a claim. Absolute proof only exists in the abstract realms of logic and math. We live in a world where the best we can do on any matter is make theories based on observations. One person says, \"Based on what I see and what I feel, it makes sense to me that there must be a God. I'll call myself a Christian/Muslim/Jew/Druid/whatever since that best describes my interpretation of the world.\" Another persons says, \"I look at the world and see no evidence for the supernatural. It makes sense to me that there is no God. I'll call myself an atheist since that best describes my interpretation.\" From this perspective, arguing against the term \"atheism\" or \"theism\" makes no difference to the validity of the worldviews themselves. What you have to look at is the evidence that supports or doesn't support either of them. \n \n Personally, I've heard this argument from apologists and evangelicals numerous times. It's used to try and knock the atheist back to a softer position, but it isn't terribly effective, for the above reasons. As I heard one woman recently say to a particularly obstinate evangelist, \"You can call me whatever makes you happy,\" but it doesn't change her lack of beliefs.\n \n To further expand the definition of the word, I'm an atheist towards God, an atheist towards leprechauns, an atheist towards invisible pink elephants and pretty much any supernatural phenomenon that one can think up. Is it possible that such things exist somewhere in the vast universe? Perhaps, but I feel comfortable enough with our current knowledge of the laws of physics to say that there's no need to posit their existence. Besides, if I were a believer, I think that argument (that God could exist somewhere we haven't looked yet) actually belittles the religious experience. God is supposed to be everywhere, and finding Him, an easy task. To use the \"atheism/omnipotence\" argument is to effectively admit that there is, in fact, no legitimate evidence for God in our current realm of knowledge. \n \n Of course, as has been said, absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence. The fact that there's an absence of evidence for an invisible, insubstantial pink elephant right behind me doesn't mean that there's not one there. This follows for God as well. Philosophically speaking, they're the same. We could populate every square inch of the universe with such non-things and yet, at the end of the day, there's just us, our actions and our relationships to each other that make up our world. For me, that's enough. \n \n\n \n I'll be adding some more to this in the coming couple weeks on the nature of morality and the Meaning of Life (that one should be easy). In the meantime, I hope it's useful to anyone here and I certainly welcome any debate on the topic. Thanks!",

   "However, when you start looking closer, you might see some different varieties of atheists - \"weak atheists,\" who might also be called agnostics - and \"strong atheists,\" who would be more likely to say that there absolutely is no God, period.\n\n I'm repeatedly surprised by how many people equate weak atheism with agnosticism. Here's how it works:\n Strong atheism: \"I positively believe that there is no god.\"\n Weak atheism: \"I lack the belief in a god,\" or sometimes, \"I don't think there is a god.\"\n Weak agnosticism: \"I don't know if there is a god.\"\n Strong agnosticism: \"There is no way to know if there is a god.\" (This one led to the bumper sticker: MILITANT AGNOSTICISM; I don't know, and you don't either.)\n \n \nAbsolute proof only exists in the abstract realms of logic and math.\n\n And liquor. emoticon_xhoho\n \n \nTo further expand the definition of the word, I'm an atheist towards God, an atheist towards leprechauns, an atheist towards invisible pink elephants and pretty much any supernatural phenomenon that one can think up.\n\n This is indeed the correct rebuttal. You can prove that your sister uses the logic behind the assumption of atheism all the time, be it with leprechauns, invisible pink unicorns (mhhhnbs), Greek gods and godesses, Ahuramazda, and the big head from Star Trek V. She doesn't claim to need omnipotence to reject belief in those entities, so she is committing the fallacy so special pleading with her argument.\n \n Those things being said, you must realize: you sister, as well as anyone else, is entitled to her own religious beliefs regardless of how silly they are or how much you object. It's one thing to defend your beliefs, but it's quite another to go on the offensive without an invitation or provocation. While I would love to say at will to Bible-thumpers, \"Your beliefs are silly and -- more importantly -- your actions are sometimes detrimental to society,\" that would reduce me to acting at their level of blind proselytization in violation of one's civil rights. I choose not to stoop that low, and I encourage you to choose the same.",

   "So...all Christians have some sort of brain damage, trebor? You're not getting any better at this are you?\n\n \n Despite Trebor's caustic language, he does have a point. The assertion of the religious, if believed by an individual, would be evidence of mental illness. To quote Sam Harris:\n \n \nIf I believe that Christ was born of a virgin, resurrected bodily after death, and is now literally transformed into a wafer at the Mass, I can still function as a respected member of society. I can believe these propositions because millions of others believe them, and we have all been taught to overlook how irrational this picture of reality is. If, on the other hand, I wake up tomorrow morning believing that God is communicating with me through my hairdryer, I'll be considered a nut, even in church. The beliefs themselves are more or less on a par-in so far as they are in flagrant violation of the most basic principles of reason. The perversity of religion is that it allows sane people to believe the unbelievable en masse. \n\n \n There are no other circumstances of human belief systems in which we allow such departures from reason, other than religious belief. This is not to say that the religious are mentally ill, but why is it that is exactly how we would label an individual who believes a similar, if unique collection of ideas??

   "Religion was once an honorable system of beliefs based on God and His teachings. It made its way through horrible times, taking root in the foundation of society - the home.

In Darwinian terms, something that costs so much (whether it's a tithe, a hole in your tongue or a virgin sacrifice) will persist only if it delivers an even greater pay-off; and for most of history religion has done just that, cementing societies together in a common cause, providing rationalisation and sanctification of codes of behaviour, and legitimising leadership.\n \n Since the Enlightenment, we have begun to see that these things are possible without an underpinning of irrational belief in supernatural agencies. However, a strong disposition in human brains to look for causes, and to invent supernatural ones where no natural cause is obvious, means that religion will be with us for some generations yet.",

The biggest problem in the discussion is using a diverse term generally.

This isn't so much a discussion for an atheist to get into as it is between different sects of Christianity battling for who has the \"correct interpretation.\" \n\n The OP is Logic of Atheism, which is why we are discussing the need for religion in the first place. Interpretation of God's Word is not the problem. The problem lies in the blatant misinterpretation of His Word. I believe those that do this aren't quite sure there's a God or gods, either. That's where my point comes to focus...or at least I would have thought so. There's going to be honest mistakes made in interpretation no matter what division of religion to which one belongs. It's sort of hard to make that claim if a preacher screams about drinking a beer late of an evening, yet he takes the church's money to make a political contribution, or to further the cause of some joint venture into the oil business.\n \nMaybe the \"correct\" version of Christianity only existed between Jesus and his immediate followers. \n\n Despite popular belief, we can all be His direct followers. If you trust in Him and believe you can and will shuck all the unnecessary things of religion. Some find it hard to attend church without the usual condiments. God's Word needs no spicing-up...it's perfect the way it is. \n \nMaybe the \"correct\" version entails handling snakes and speaking in tongues.

He instructs us to allow Him to work through us, not for us to work through Him. If it takes the handling of snakes to prove His existence, then there would have been no need for Him to bear the Cross. Material things are and will always be material things - whether it be snakes or diamonds.\n \nPersonally, I think the correct interpretaton of the Bible is as a document of the beliefs of some ancient people looking for answers.\n\n That's your opinion and I shouldn't condemn you for it.

However, I agree that there is no progress being made at this point. \n \n EF - I think the point has been made pretty darn clearly, I have no idea how to present it to you in a different/better manner. I understand your position, and I think the others do as well, but it's been proven wrong IMHO, rather comprehensively. It is of course your perogative as to how to deal with the info you've been given.\n \n Waxy\n\n \n \n The problem with 'logic' is that the result is only as good as the premise. \n Garbage in , garbage out.",
