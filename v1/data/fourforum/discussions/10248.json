   "One of the most hateful mothers I have read about. \n \n I wish I could tell you precisely how angry I am right at this moment. The rage is boiling up like you wouldn't believe. It is almost 5 am and I should be going to bed. I can't. The very, very ugly head of hate and bigotry has reared itself again and harmed innocent people and destroyed the beauty of loving commitment. I want to tell you about two of the cruellest, most vicious, bastards I have ever heard of. And I sincerely hope that both of them are struck down dead soon. These people are monsters for what they did. These vile people are Thomas and Jeanne Atkins of Carmel, Indiana.\n \n Now, let me tell you about their son, Patrick. Patrick was raised by these two \"parents\" who were ultra-religious and still are. Patrick went off to Wabash College in 1978 and there he fell in love. His parents hated the idea. The person he loved was Brett Conrad.\n \n For a quarter of a century Brett and Patrick lived, loved and struggled together, to establish their lives. After 12 years they were able to buy a home together. They shared their bank accounts and their entire life. The bastards of parents hated every moment of it. But the lengths they would go to astounds me and I don't expect much humanity from fanatics.\n \n Patrick was on a business trip in Atlanta when he collapsed from a ruptured aneurysm and then, while still in hospital, he had a stroke. Brett rushed to Atlanta to be with his partner. The vile parents had flown down as well and asserted legal control over their incapacitated son. They hate homosexuals and homosexuality. And they don't want Patrick to ever be allowed to see Brett again. You can see why I think these people are walking pieces of ####.\n \n According to court documents Patrick's brother said \"that Brett's mere presence in the hospital was 'hurting' Jeanne and offending her religious beliefs.\" The court also said that \" Jeanne told Brett that if Patrick was going to return to his life with Brett, after recovering from the stroke, she would prefer that he not recover at all.\" Any woman that would wish this upon her own son is not fit to be called a mother, unless one were to insert a very rude word immediately thereafter.\n \n Jeanne is a fanatical Catholic. The picture above is of her leading employees, at the company her son used to run, in daily prayer sessions. On top of that she attends Catholic Mass every day. We are talking hard-core fanatic. It takes a lot of faith to inflict this much pain on others.\n \n At first the family would allow Brett 15 minutes with Patrick but only after they had left so that they wouldn't have to be religiously offended by the FACT that Patrick is gay. But then the cruelty of righteousness got the upper hand and they banned the visits altogether. Only \"family\" and clergy were allowed in by the family's orders. The court reports, with seeming approval, that \"hospital staff defied the family's instructions and allowed Brett to continue to visit with Patrick in the morning and in the evenings, outside of regular visiting hours.\" Good on them.\n \n Patrick is pretty much incapacitated. He can do basic things with help but can't understand most of what he reads and can only engage in simple, short conversations. Brett has been fighting to bring Patrick back to the relationship and home they built together. The \"parents\" refuse to consider it. It's a sin, is all they can snarl. I don't quote this guy often, but didn't someone these people allegedly worship supposedly say: \"As you have done it unto one of the least of these, you have done it unto me\"?\n \n Brett went to court but Indiana doesn't recognize gay relationships in any form. Thanks to the Republicans they have a constitutional amendment specifically forbidding legal recognition of gay couples. The court was sympathetic but their hands were tied. The court said: \"We are confronted here with the heartbreaking fracture of a family. Brett and Patrick have spent 25 years together as life partners -- longer than Patrick lived at home with his parents -- and their future life together has been destroyed by Patrick's tragic medical condition and by the Atkinses' unwillingness to accept their son's lifestyle.\" The court said that given the parent's rabidly antigay views that it was skeptical they could properly care from Patrick's emotional needs but their hands were tied by the law.\n \n The best the court could do was grant Brett visitation rights . What god-damned awful people are these parents from hell. But these bastards weren't finished. They are going back to court to deny even this much. The argument is that Brett has no legal standing and that they, as the so-called parents, are guardians and that means they can determine anything they want about who is allowed to visit their son. What perfect little Hitlers they have become.\n \n First, the parents stuck their son in a nursing home. Brett would come by after hours to spend time with his partner so the parents wouldn't see him. Staff at the nursing facility said that Brett's \"visits had a positive impact on Patrick's recovery.\" An observer from the court testified it is \"evident that Patrick loves Brett very much and it is evident that Brett loves Patrick.\n \n A neuropsychologist told the court that a long term relationship is beneficial to recovery. Normally he would try \"to reintegrate the patient into that environment so that they can participate in activities and situations with which they're familiar.\" He said spending time with Brett would be beneficial. The family argued in court that any visitation \"poses a risk of diminishing Patrick's chance for normalcy of life.\" I suspect they are referring to his homosexuality and not his illness. These parents apparently would prefer their son to be incapacitated than for him to be gay. Lovely people!\n \n When Brett filed for guardianship, which the courts denied because of the law, the parents suddenly had Patrick transferred to their home even though they were told this would negatively impact Patrick's recover. They have prevented Brett from coming on the property and won't even let him speak to Patrick by telephone. They also grabbed what assets they could. And they admitted that regardless of what the court ordered they would never allow Patrick to see his partner again. All of this pain just because they believe that a deity has told them to act this way.\n \n Under guardianship laws in Indiana there is no provision to recognize gay partners, no matter how loving or how long they have been together. Parents, no matter how cruel, have superior rights. The court document is heartbreaking. It lays out the facts that these parents can't stomach.\n \n It acknowledges the men have, for 25 years, \"lived together and have been in a committed and loving relationship\" but that the parents \"vehemently disapprove\". The court quoted a letter Patrick had sent his parents begging them to accept Brett. \"I want you all to know that Brett is my best friend in the wold world and I love him more than life itself. I beg all of you to reach to him with the same love you have for me, he is extremely special and once you know him you will understand why I love him so much.\" The parents refused that request.\n \n The court says that Jeanne is so hateful of homosexuals that Brett's family, which is accepting of the couple, were called \"evil\" and \"sinners\" because they refused to condemn them. Jeanne \"testified that no amount of evidence could convince her that Patrick and Brett were happy together or that they had a positive and beneficial relationship.\"\n http://freestudents.blogspot.com/2007/08/one-of-most-hateful-mothers-i-have-read.html",

And so many times people conflate those two, intentionally I suspect. That's exactly WHY I get suspicious when these horror stories are dredged up--are you taking issue with the fact that parents simply mistreated their son and were being terrible parents? Then yes, of course I agree with you. And probably most anyone here would. Heck, maybe even AA. But if you're trying to use this story as a way to say that moralistic objection toward gay relations is wrong in and of itself, then no. I'm not willing to go that far. So frankly, I don't know what your intentions were for posting it. I think a very important point needs to be made .... the sin of the parents wasn't that they objected to what their son was doing, but was that they mistreated their son.  Or as you say, they \"went overboard.\"\n \n \n2) I get pretty sick and tired...\n scratch that. make that BORED with claims that pretend that both sides of the fence have equivalence.\n\n \n I did NOT say they were equivalent.\n \n \nThere is no \"probably\" about this.\n These things ARE happening to some gay couples.\n \n I don't know about you, but I don't know any \"weight\" or \"situation\" whereby a choir boy abused is okay.\n No circumstance where an Iraqi woman raped is okay.\n \n\n \n And like I said, lots of bad things happen to lots of people. The choir boys; the Iraqi women. We take each situation and fix it in it's own way. It doesn't mean we get rid of our soldiers, or tell all priests they can't be in the same room as choir boys. But more importantly, it doesn't speak to the norm. None of these horror stories (including the one you posted) speak to what happens in MOST cases, because most of the time, gays are able to live together without people ruining their lives.\n \n Tell you what Foundit ... why don't you tell us, specifically, how you think this situation in the article should be reacted to. What specifically needs to be done? What are you calling for, if anything?\n \n \nAnd I have seen NO equivalent scenario of similar tragedy, or potential for similar tragedy, playing out on the flip side of the field.\n\n \n You're off on the wrong tangent here on this \"equivilent\" tragedy, that has occupied so much of your post. That wasn't even what I meant, so I'm not even going to bother addressing it.\n \n \nMoreover, the abused choir boy HAS LEGAL RECOURSE.\n The raped Iraqi woman can hopefully get her story out and SEE LEGAL RECOURSE.\n In this situation, this tragedy IS the legal recourse. It IS how the law plays out.\n\n \n Actually, the gay man in your story--Brett--would have had legal recourse too if they had taken some fairly simply preparations. It's called having Power of Attorney. It's a fairly simple, inexpensive process, and it WORKS. (I know, because I've had experience with it.) They should have done that. No, it doesn't make the parents' actions any less vile. But it would have been a legal recourse for them.\n \n \nI'll take this to mean that my suspicions above that it wasn't justified are accurate. If not, please correct me. I don't know why you can't just admit that. The fact that you can't just admit that is probably part of why MrWriteLA made the comment in the first place. It would be so easy to simply say, \"This family went overboard.\", and that's it. I mean, I have never seen you advocate such extreme treatment, so why is it so hard to simply criticize what happened without the extra junk?\n\n \n Because I don't want to look at a complicated situation in a simpleton-sort-of way. Like I said, taking that appoach is the easy, convenient thing to do, but not always the best one. \n \n I would think that by saying \"obviously compassion should take precedence. Obviously the parents should put the interests of their son first and do what would bring him happiness and well-being in this situation, and allow the two of them to be together\" that would make clear that I felt the parents \"went overboard\". (Actually, I'd say that's being pretty generous toward them in terms of portraying their actions.) But since it seems so important to you and MrWrite to hear it said, yes the parents went overboard.

I'm not willing to go that far.\n\n Considering I referred to this family as \"extreme\", I would hope you could put two and two together that I am not taking this EXTREME case and trying to derive a conclusion for the whole.\n \n \n \nSo frankly, I don't know what your intentions were for posting it.\n\n I have to chuckle at statements like this when I EXPLICITLY STATE what my position is, and then you act like I haven't done that.\n \n Let me repeat it for you, and I'll even sign-post it. (\"Can we get a spotlight over here?\")Moreover, the abused choir boy HAS LEGAL RECOURSE.\n The raped Iraqi woman can hopefully get her story out and SEE LEGAL RECOURSE.\n In this situation, this tragedy IS the legal recourse. It IS how the law plays out.\n THAT is my intention. To point out how the law is woefully inadequate regarding gay couples, and in fact how some DOMAs go above and beyond the call of duty in actually mandating that gay couples be NOT recognized legally.\n \n \n \nI think a very important point needs to be made .... the sin of the parents wasn't that they objected to what their son was doing, but was that they mistreated their son.  Or as you say, they \"went overboard.\"\n\n Again, I have to laugh.\n You quote me in ADMITTING that they are extreme with my comment of \"went overboard\", yet you try to pretend that somehow I was making a point (or that you should be concerned that I might be making a point) about ALL people who are against homosexuality by generalization.\n \n The signs are clear that is NOT what I was doing.\n You even REPEAT the signs that are there.\n Yet you fail to recognize them. Or possibly just ignore them because you just need some foot-hold to criticize me or other gays (or conjure a specter of potential criticism) for an imaginary stance which nobody is taking.\n \n Again, PAR for your course... emoticon_xgood \n \n \n \nI did NOT say they were equivalent.\n\n Quibbling over the word is meaningless.\n Your statements suggested that any sides had a \"horror story\".\n Quite frankly, THIS was a horror story.\n The \"horror\" your side goes through is the equivalent of having to sit through Gigli.\n \n So, to repeat my point again because you didn't really respond to it, your side DOES NOT have horror stories that are anywhere near the #### involved in this one.\n So don't try to even hint at it.\n \n \n \nAnd like I said, lots of bad things happen to lots of people. The choir boys; the Iraqi women.\n\n 1) Why do you repeat yourself when I EXPLICITLY responded to EXACTLY what you said? It makes no sense.\n \n 2) And like I said, the point IS NOT that \"bad things happen\", but rather that the law MANDATES that bad things can happen.\n For the choir boys, if they go to the law, the problem will be fixed.\n For the Iraqi women, if their problem is brought to public, the offenders will be put on trial.\n \n The tragedy HERE is that the law MANDATED this tragedy continue.\n \n \n \nWe take each situation and fix it in it's own way.\n\n Fine Jyoshu.\n HOW do we fix this situation?\n I realize you've given some initial responses to this query, but I'm hoping that you can do better.\n \n \n \nTell you what Foundit ... why don't you tell us, specifically, how you think this situation in the article should be reacted to. What specifically needs to be done? What are you calling for, if anything?\n\n 1) Gay marriage.\n 2) If not gay marriage, completely equal civil unions. That means state and federal level, with all the same benefits, rights, and responsibilities copied over. \"Super\" DOMAs that tie the state's hands by insisting that gay relationships cannot receive benefits or legal recognition need to be stricken.\n \n \n \nYou're off on the wrong tangent here on this \"equivilent\" tragedy, that has occupied so much of your post. That wasn't even what I meant, so I'm not even going to bother addressing it.\n\n Actually, I think I'm right on track.\n And interestingly enough, you don't even try to claim I am wrong. Just on a \"tangent\".\n \n \n \nActually, the gay man in your story--Brett--would have had legal recourse too if they had taken some fairly simply preparations. It's called having Power of Attorney. It's a fairly simple, inexpensive process, and it WORKS.\n\n I wonder how many straight couples out there have powers of attorney?\n And why should a gay couple have to go to a lawyer and pay him fees to get one, when straight married couples automatically get one like the story describes?\n I wonder if EVERY straight married couple out there suddenly had their powers of attorney revoked, would we be saying the same thing to them? That the wife / husband should have gotten a document instead?\n It's heterosexual privilege that people like you take for granted. Ignoring the extra hoops that you ask others to jump through, while ignoring the special rights you are granted in not having to jump through them.\n \n \n \nBecause I don't want to look at a complicated situation in a simpleton-sort-of way.\n\n Of course not WHEN it's a situation where the anti-gay people are coming under scrutiny.\n But when it comes to situations like gay people wearing matching accessories, or a dummy in a store window dressed up in a way some might consider as \"gay\", you're all about the \"simpleton\" then, aren't you...\n \n \n \nI would think that by saying \"obviously compassion should take precedence. Obviously the parents should put the interests of their son first and do what would bring him happiness and well-being in this situation, and allow the two of them to be together\" that would make clear that I felt the parents \"went overboard\". (Actually, I'd say that's being pretty generous toward them in terms of portraying their actions.) But since it seems so important to you and MrWrite to hear it said, yes the parents went overboard. They treated their son and his partner like scum.\n\n Quite frankly, it would be so much easier to JUST SAY that instead of dredging up strawman arguments that nobody is posing, and trying to dredge up \"raped Iraqi women\" in a conversation to help diminish the situation.\n \n By analogy, would you tell an Iraqi woman \"Well, you should have taken precautions and moved when you heard the military was coming.\"\n Would you tell the altar boy \"Well, you should have been a Lutheran\"\n But your solution for this situation is to tell the gay couple that they should have taken precautions with a power of attorney. emoticon_xdonno \n \n Straight couples (that aren't married) would be able to qualify as \"common law marriage\" and argue such a thing in court to help defend against such problems.\n But here, an anti-gay legislation worked against even that simple argument, and actually prevented such an argument from being made.\n The court EXPLICITLY talked about how their hands were tied by the DOMA legislation.\n \n In some regards, I have to laugh a little because this would have been a PERFECT situation for you to plug \"civil unions\" as a solution, but of course THAT should probably only be dragged out when you need some kind of deferrence away from marriage, and here you had more obvious issues of strawman arguments you could start with, eh?",
