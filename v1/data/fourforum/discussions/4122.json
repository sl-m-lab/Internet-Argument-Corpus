That's likely because most of the blacks were in the South. It had nothing to do with the relative degree of racism that existed throughout the country.\n \n My dad correctly predicted in the '50s that there would be more racial strife in the North than in the South. It's true that the front page lynchings and murders occurred mostly in the South, but the Chicago riots, the Watts riots and the stories of mistreatment from blacks who moved to the North and back show that the problem is common to all parts of the country.\n \n Southerners tended to accept blacks on an individual basis and reject the thought of mass racial equality. Northerners tended to accept the idea of racial equality but rejected the thought of individual blacks being part of their lives.\n \n Ethnic pride and the expected coagulation of like minded people gave some of the big cities the \"little italy\", \"little germany\", \"little ireland\" areas where alien individuals were (and still are) not accepted with friendship. New York City is a prime example, but Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami and others have the same divisive but natural separation of turf.\n \n Racism is passed down from generation to generation. It will not disappear until we all disappear.",
