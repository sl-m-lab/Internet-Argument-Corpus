   "To address the original question though...Democratic leaders have screwed up, and I'm not just saying that because I'm a Republican. The DNC's leadership has locked itself in a room and through groupthink, has convinced itself that everybody in the party and America itself A. hates Bush, B. hates the war, C. thinks things could be so, so much better, and D. desires a wave of liberal social policy. This is their platform, it's failed in 2000, 2002, and 2004, and somehow, they still sit and wonder, \"Why isn't our plan working?\"\n \n They need to realize that most folks don't think that way. Some do, but most don't. Generally, people are moderate and vote according to things that affect them. Now, my GOP is not perfect, but we have been successful because we try to cater to practical issues and don't sit and around bitch about \"how bad things are.\" That's the other thing about the Democrats - they talk about problems, but they don't present any possible solutions. As long as the Democrats keep thier heads in the clouds and pass out negativity, they will continue to lose ground.",

   "Not sure I agree with that. In the last election the media barely covered any of Bush's policies, polices the majority of Americans are now disagreeing with. SS reform is going nowhere fast. Immigration policies by Bush are overwhemlingly beening rejected by the country. His sheer incompetence to secure the borders, nuclear power plants and ports doesn't have any American who loves their country on his side. Few Americans agree with his spend and borrow policy. Now, how many Americans knew about that when they voted? emoticon_rolleyes \n \n As for Dems, what did the election media actually cover in terms of Kerry's platform? \n \n Um...Nothing beyond abortion? Virtually every ad was on his past, past that is irrevelant towards how he would governor, not to mention a number of thing sthey attacked kerry on easily apply to Republicans. \n \n The real problem the dems have is reveling in the scum that the republicans love to toss at them. As soon as they stop hesistating and learn to litterally avoid discussing at all costs the actual platforms and making litteral fabrications and lies aganist their opponents, they will get back in the game.

In a world/historical sense, conservatives would want absolute monarchy, and liberals would want absolute individual freedom. In that way, Republicans aren't conservative.
