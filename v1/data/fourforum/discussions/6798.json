   "I wanted to go ahead and put up a thread for college teams (Football/basketball/etc.) If this starts to go all over the place, it can easily be separated into separate categories. Basically, for now, College teams and sports and how they are doing.\n I'll go ahead and get started since I'm putting this up. As a current KU student, I'm rooting for KU. In football, the Jayhawks beat Mizzou 13-3 (big border rivals) and just this last weekend, they beat Nebraska. That was a first since 1968 and the Jayhawks beat Nebraska 40-15. There are talks of KU making it to a college bowl this year. I would like to see that happen.\n So, anyone else have opinions on College sports?",
