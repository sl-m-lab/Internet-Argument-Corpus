Keeping their old communist system would be the conservative move. You dont seem to know what either of those terms actually mean. I would suggest you actually LOOK THEM UP because I have to tell you, you look like a complete and utter jackass trying to claim that the founding fathers were conservative. \n \n Second of all, China is not a capitalist country. It is hard to say what China is. They do not classify themselves as capitalist (they say they are market communists). The WTO does not classify them as capitalists. The US government does not classify them as capitalists. \n \n Their state directed economy is a lot closer to a Fascist economic system than anything else, but even that does not fit because there is no corporatism. \n \n The truth is that the Chinese economy is, for all intents and purposes, something NEW. You can not really even call them a \"mixed\" economy like you see in many European nations because typically for a mixed economy wealth distribution is modified via taxation and defined benefits. That is not china. \n \n Currently over 90% of business loans in China are made by state owned banks, and by agreement roughly half those loans are nonperforming. The chinese government literally find people they think can run a billion dollar business, gives them a billion dollars, and turns them loose. Even that is not the wealth allocation via taxation you see in mixed economies because by leveraging their fractional reserve banking system to make the loans, they are not using anybodies tax dollars. They are literally printing the money, transferring the loans to the central bank, who then drops them off the balance sheet. \n \n There are certainly some capitalist components to the chinese economic system, but when your government controls the VAST majority of your financial system, government officials literally call you to tell you how much to pay your people, how much of your product to produce, delivers R&D to your doorstep, sets your prices, and settles worker disputes by sending a government official to run your company and get things back on track, that aint capitalism.\n \n If you had actually taken any of those economic classes you recommend for others, you would recognize how novel and exciting the chinese system is. We are literally seeing the formation of a NEW economic system, and by all standards an incredibly successful one. As it matures, it seems likely that the Chinese system, whatever we end up calling it, will probably replace capitalism as the worlds most successful economic system. The efficiency gains they get from central direction are incredible. They do not have 5000 companies all researching different types of solar cells and hoping to come up with something new. Instead they figure out which research avenues are the most promising, pull the best R&D people that those companies have to offer, the government throws billions of dollars at it, and they come up with the solutions they are looking for.

We have data on gender payroll disparity going back to 1952, and women have always gotten the short end of the stick, despite the fact that we have data going back to 1963 that shows consistently that women are more productive than male employees. \n \n The problem is that capitalist theory, or free market theory, requires that everybody always make the decision that makes the most economic sense. That is unrealistic. Most Americans do not even know how to TELL which decision makes the most economic sense. They have no idea. They just do things with no clue what the ramifications are. That is why less than 2% of the companies in our stock market can justify their valuation with a fundamental analysis. That is why we just had a massive housing bubble. Those people buying those houses pretty clearly did not make the decision that makes the most economic sense. Those people buying the MBS paper CERTAINLY did not make the decision that made the most economic sense. \n \n The sole purpose of a market economy is price discovery, and the markets price discovery broke down COMPLETELY. Assets were literally priced at thousands of times their actual worth. \n \n So, in a way, you could be right. If everybody made decisions based solely on what makes the most sense economically, the lower wages that women are paid would ultimately turn out to be a good thing for women.

When a problem happens with the Foxconn board or if the board has a terrible layout the users are basically scr*wed for an entire generation of computer parts. No one really knows how to fix the problem and some mid-level manager jumps out a 10 story window and life moves on. \n \n So yeah, you have one hell of a production team going on over there but with a lot of sacrifice.

Somewhere, deep in the bowels of Foxconn, there is a little chinese man sitting at a desk with a great big grin on his face saying \"OK....you no like Foxconn....you buy other brand....It OKAAAY...we own them all!! Buy Asus...that us! Buy Dell....us inside!!!\"\n \n It is also worth noting that the products offered for sale domestically in china are MUCH different than what they export. The cheap chinese junk all gets shipped to Wal Mart. The good stuff ends up getting sold domestically. \n \n Innovation is, in large part, a function of knowledge and funding, and with enough funding you can buy the knowledge. As far as ideas, you can just steal them from somebody else. Remember Obamas \"Sputnik moment\" speech where he was talking about how the US is missing the boat on green energy, and if we do not get out there and lead we are going to get left behind?? 4 days later the Chinese announced $40 billion in YEARLY grants to renewable energy research and startups. \n \n I actually agree with you on the innovation component. However, I dont think that necessarily negates the efficiency gains. BUT...should having the most efficient economy necessarily be the goal? My vacation is pretty damn inefficient. I like to take lots of them. Believe me, Chinas central planning board would NOT approve. It goes back to the age old question \"Do you work for a living or do you live to work?\"",

That is where their tax revenues go...to compensate manufacturers who are ordered to sell their product under production costs. \n \n The only reason China is not slapped with punitive tariffs all over the world is that anti dumping laws (and laws against government support of industries, which at the end of the day are the same thing) have exceptions for non market based nations, and since there is not a single trade organization that classifies China as a capitalist nation, they are exempt. \n \n \n \ntoo stupid!!! they are successful now as capitalists only because, being so poor, they work longer, harder and cheaper than anyone in the world. \n \n \n So the fact that their return on pre production capital is 400x more than anywhere else on the planet has nothing to do with it? Longer, harder, and cheaper does nothing for you if you are shoveling dung. Look at how quickly they have managed to move from what was essentially manufacturing industry based on 1960s technology to having one of the most technologically advanced manufacturing sectors in the world.

The simple fact of the matter is that you save an enormous amount of resources, and typically get quicker results, by eliminating duplicitous effort. It works in the US, too. Look at the manhattan project. Prior to the beginning of the project, there were over 200 different projects, both private and public sector, that had been looking at nuclear energy and weapon applications for years. They could not get it past theory. The Government federalized all those projects, put them under one umbrella with a single management structure, and they moved from theory to a working weapon in less than 18 months.",

Actually, dear, those for freedom and liberty from government are conservatives and those who are statist are liberal.\n \n \n \n\n Yea. Adam Smiths theory of moral sentiment. Smith also endorsed the labor theory of value and believed that profit came from ownership of capital, not entrepreneurship, savings, or wages. Das Kapital was based almost entirely on Smiths theories. \n\n \n \n you get more stupid all the time don't you! Smith and Marx were opposites \n \n \n \n\n Right...which is then spent on enormous social welfare net like in mixed economies....oh...wait.....no, its not......hmmm.\n\n \n no idea what subject you are on\n \n \n \n\n 53 dumping cases in the last 5 years, China lost all of them. That is where their tax revenues go...to compensate manufacturers who are ordered to sell their product under production costs.\n\n \n \n subject???????????????? \n \n \n\n The only reason China is not slapped with punitive tariffs all over the world is that anti dumping laws (and laws against government support of industries, which at the end of the day are the same thing) have exceptions for non market based nations, and since there is not a single trade organization that classifies China as a capitalist nation, they are exempt.\n\n \n 1) if they want to sell us stuff below cost that makes us rich, and them poor! The world actually encourages it. Econ 101\n \n 2) capitalism is mostly about competing in a free market to have the best product at the lowest price. China is hugely capitalist. \n \n \n \n So the fact that their return on pre production capital is 400x more than anywhere else on the planet has nothing to do with it? Longer, harder, and cheaper does nothing for you if you are shoveling dung.\n\n \n but it does everything if you are competing successfully in the international market as China does. \n \n \n \nLook at how quickly they have managed to move from what was essentially manufacturing industry based on 1960s technology to having one of the most technologically advanced manufacturing sectors in the world. There is a LOT more to it than just being able to supply cheap warm bodies to an assembly line.\n\n \n \n yes, they are importing western expertise, but so what??? Who disagrees????? \n \n \n\n You can spew all the ideological BS you want....that seems to be all you know how to do anyway. Facts are not your strong point. At the end of the day, their central direction policies provide a LOT more bang for their buck than you see in any other economy on the planet. \n\n \n \n Do you think they have found genius who can see the future?? Did they know about Facebook? Did they know Microsoft would take over IBM, that IBM would take over RCA and GE in computers? Did they know Google would take over the internet from Microsoft. Did they know Amazon would succeed or the GM volt would sell only 500 units?? Did they know Apple would kill Nokia? See why we are positive the liberal will always be stupid!! \n \n \n \n\n The simple fact of the matter is that you save an enormous amount of resources, and typically get quicker results, by eliminating duplicitous effort.\n\n \n exactly, or so Stalin and Mao thought before they killed 120 million with your liberal idea. It is no wonder that our liberals spied for Stalin. Why have IBM and Microsoft both in computers when a libtard bureaucrat can see the future!! See why the liberal will be perfectly stupid?? \n \n \n\n It works in the US, too. Look at the manhattan project. Prior to the beginning of the project, there were over 200 different projects, both private and public sector, that had been looking at nuclear energy and weapon applications for years. They could not get it past theory. The Government federalized all those projects, put them under one umbrella with a single management structure, and they moved from theory to a working weapon in less than 18 months.\n\n \n Too stupid, and oh so perfectly liberal. A nuke during World War is perhaps the least representative example one could possibly think of!! The USSR produced many military hits because it was a matter of life and death to them, but not one single consumer product innnovation the entire time!! Catching on now??",

Smith was right in that he understood how the invisible hand worked to make a pin and to enrich everyone beyond belief, in fact to instantly transform the earth after 10,000 years of non capitalist stagnation.\n \n \nI am very concerned and have been for some time, that the monetary policy of China and the direct investments, are tilting the entire country towards exports, in the long run this is not sustainable and will result in a crash.

   "LIBERAL - favorable to or in accord with concepts of maximum individual freedom possible, especially as guaranteed by law and secured by governmental protection of civil liberties.\n \n CONSERVATIVE - disposed to preserve existing conditions, institutions, etc., or to restore traditional ones, and to limit change.\n \n I guess if one can't stand change, consider improvement, or think the stone age is the way to go, CONSERVATIVE is the way to be.\n\n \nUh.....first of all, introducing capitalism to china would be a liberal move, not a conservative one. Keeping their old communist system would be the conservative move. You dont seem to know what either of those terms actually mean. I would suggest you actually LOOK THEM UP because I have to tell you, you look like a complete and utter jackass trying to claim that the founding fathers were conservative. \n \n\n That is what the terms would mean if they were not twisted and mutilated after 50 years of political tug of war.\n \n It is not what they mean now and you know it.\n \n If it was than sarah palin is more liberal than obama.\n \n \nCurrently over 90% of business loans in China are made by state owned banks, and by agreement roughly half those loans are nonperforming. The chinese government literally find people they think can run a billion dollar business, gives them a billion dollars, and turns them loose. Even that is not the wealth allocation via taxation you see in mixed economies because by leveraging their fractional reserve banking system to make the loans, they are not using anybodies tax dollars. They are literally printing the money, transferring the loans to the central bank, who then drops them off the balance sheet. \n\n Printing money accomplishes removal of wealth to the government just as surely as taxation does in any country with an arbitrary unit of currency. Pointing out that they use it far more than we do is a null point when distinguishing the principles of their government.\n \n \nIf you had actually taken any of those economic classes you recommend for others, you would recognize how novel and exciting the chinese system is. We are literally seeing the formation of a NEW economic system\n\n Exciting in the way one observes a volcano smoke before eruption.\n \n China is forming a stable fascism, it only appears new to you because the only examples of fascism we have had yet burned rather quickly and were geared to war time for a good chunk of their existance.\n \n \nand by all standards an incredibly successful one\n\n Not by all standards.\n \n \nAs it matures, it seems likely that the Chinese system, whatever we end up calling it, will probably replace capitalism as the worlds most successful economic system. The efficiency gains they get from central direction are incredible. They do not have 5000 companies all researching different types of solar cells and hoping to come up with something new. Instead they figure out which research avenues are the most promising, pull the best R&D people that those companies have to offer, the government throws billions of dollars at it, and they come up with the solutions they are looking for. There is no duplicate effort. As long as the research continues to look promising they continue funding it at whatever level is needed. Stuff gets DONE.\n\n Now I know why you ignored me, liberal morality would become very constricting to your new world order.\n \n \nThe problem is that capitalist theory, or free market theory, requires that everybody always make the decision that makes the most economic sense. That is unrealistic. Most Americans do not even know how to TELL which decision makes the most economic sense. \n\n No it just requires that they do it often, and that is only required for efficiency, not the maintenance of liberty.\n \n If you want to turn that stick around, every other theory requires that who ever makes the decisions always makes the right one that makes the most economic sense.\n \n You just finished your little propaganda short on the fascist communist fusion in china. Doesn't that require that the central direction always make the correct decision that makes the most economic sense?\n \n Let's stop pretending that people in the past were so idiotic and observe how similar some modern political ideas are to traditional feudalism.\n \n Isn't that a great idea provided that the lords always make the correct decesion, I mean after all who could expect peasants to do that?",
