When these differences are large enough to be a barrier to successful interbreeding, speciation is established.\n \n There are other mechanisms, such as allopolyploidy, but the above is accepted as the 'mainstream' theory.",

   "ender_krum, here's something that might get you started: a bit on evolutionary medicine.\n \n \nHuman biology reflects our long history as hunter-gatherers. For example, to cope with a variable food supply, we evolved the ability to consume extra calories and store them efficiently as fat. Now that most humans live very differently, this adaptation is often a disadvantage. Evolutionary medicine, an exciting new multidisciplinary field, looks at such conflicts between our biological traits and contemporary culture. It provides deep insights into a wide range of aspects of human health and biology, from childhood asthma and infant crying to breast cancer, aging, and menopause. The approach is uncovering both causes and treatments and will be an essential aspect of medical research well into the next century. This volume is a comprehensive survey of the field and contains work by such leaders as Paul Ewald, Melvin Konner, and Randolph Nesse. Topics include anxieties and phobias, substance abuse, SIDS, high-blood pressure, obesity, vitamin and mineral deficiencies, sensory disorders, and reproductive disorders including cancers. Useful as a supplementary textbook for a variety of courses, this book will prove an invaluable resource in medicine, biology, anthropology, and psychology.\n (http://www.us.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/LifeSciences/EvolutionaryBiology/?ci=0195103564&view=usa)\n \n",

How was the theory of evolution helpful in determining the little buggers phylogeny?\n \n \n \n Walking-fish:\n I can give you a general picture of how phylogeny is established in microbiology. Different species or taxons will grow on different media, or show tell-tale colony characteristics, or metabolize certain substances put into the media. Then once the phylogeny is established, other things can be infered about their reactions to antibiotics. Evolution figures in here because it is based on the assumption that closely related organisms share a common ancestor. So it would make sense that a mold (which is a type of fungus) shares the same common ancestor that other fungi share, and would have a lot of biochemical similarities with them which it would not share with bacteria.\n \n A creationist view would not be based on that assumption of shared ancestry, and would not lead one to believe that fungi share the same suseptibility to the same chemicals because of that common inheritance.That is, there would be no reason to expect that bacteria would be affected by bacteriocides & fungi by fungicides if a creator could arbitrarily design any system of bochemistry into each separate species without regard to their taxonomy.

The most often quoted example here is that of Stephen J Gould, who proposed that the jaws evolved in fish as a result of such genes causing a shift in the position of the first 2 gill arches relative to the others so they could be free to evolve as jaws.

   "good clip, and thanks for the link\n \n as far as medicne and biotechnology, evolution is a theory that makes sense of a lot of what scientists have observed in nature. it makes sense of both why there is a wide variety of species in an area, as well as why many species can be classified as \"related\". it makes sense of environmental effects on living things, and vice versa. it makes sense of heredity and genetics. it makes sense of particular offence and defense mechanisms in living things. basically, evolution serves to tie the other theories of nature together\n \n because of this better understanding of living things, we are better armed to analyse and deal with medical problems. for instance, we have a better understanding of cell mutation in reproduction, and can better engineer the cells in animals to produce more desirable offspring. also, as symbiote pointed out, we are able to understand why treatments against virii and other pests become ineffective over time, and we can formulate better ways to defeat them. \n \n one major manifestation of evolution can be seen among humans. its interesting to hear arguments like \"how come humans arent evolving into something else?\" clearly, a question like this shows a misunderstanding of the mechanisms of evolution. evolution is achieved through random mutations AND natural selection. random mutations occur all the time in humans, but natural selection is virtually impossible in a social environment such as ours. in nature, if a random mutation causes an offspring to develop a trait that makes it disadvantageous, that offspring has a smaller chance to survive, creating a net effect of a more survivable population overall. among humans, offspring with undesireable traits cannot be weeded out from the population naturally. our efforts to protect and preserve the phsyically disadvantaged is counterproductive to the evolution of the species overall. thats why man probably wont evolve the way we would naturally\n \n as a side note, it seems that the more we learn about evolution, its the more we hinder its progress. man has caused the endangerment and extinction of too many species to mention, and is now fighting to protct and preserve the environment through artificial means. we have the resources to kill the strongest member of a given species as easily as the weakest. and we have the resources to circumvent the natural life progression of an animal, affording the least fit member equal or better chances of survival than the most fit member of the species. the net effect is a naturally weaker species overall.",

First of all, there are enough harsh conditions in the \"third world\" that can weed out those with a weaker constitution. Secondly, the main thing working against speciation in humans who live under the worst conditions is the fact that there are virtually no isolated populations anymore on this planet, since there is constant migration & interbreeding which mixes gene pools. But I do think the human race may well evolve by a form of artificial selection. I'm sure genetic engineering will someday take the place of natural selection to weed out physical & mental disabilities as the genes for these defects eventually become located.

   "Well, the conventional explanation would be dimorphism driven by sexual selection. If early Ms Sapiens found hairy males more of a turn-on, she would be selecting for that trait in future generations; she might at the same time be gaining by selecting a mate with higher testosterone levels, and thus greater fathering potential. Selection by males of less hairy females would work the same trick in reverse.\n\n \n \n \n \n Walking-fish:\n You could be right that hairiness comes with the package if high testosterone levels are selected for. The hairiness, itself, may also have survival value for males by shielding the face from harsh weather, or by hiding facial expressions to make men appear less vulnerable during a confrontation. Then, sexual selection may enhance these natural selection benefits as females are attracted to males that afford the greatest amount of protection , without being so extremely high in testosterone that they are too physically abusive. So there is also a down side to high teststerone as well. These are my speculations an the matter.",

   "Concerning why humans males have 'more hair' than females, here's some info (bold added in a few places).\n \n \nIt is important to note that hair grows across all areas of the skin on humans regardless of sex or race except in the following locations: the lips, the nipples, the palms of hands, the soles of feet, certain external genital areas, and the navel. Some people may seem to have less body hair than others. In fact the difference is that some people have shorter and thinner body hair than others. Overall coverage in terms of number of folicles is relatively constant.\n \n Several theories have been advanced to explain the unique features of human hair. One theory suggests that nature selected humans for shorter and thinner body hair as part of a set of adaptations including bipedal locomotion and an upright posture. There are several problems with this theory, not least of which is that cursorial hunting is used by (other) animals that do not show any thinning of hair, and that hair similar to chimpanzees and gorillas also shades the skin from radiant heat and protects it from hot winds, and thus another mechanism for heat loss is not required. Another problem is that bipedal locomotion possibly predates hominids moving from a forest environment to a savanna environment. A more recent theory for human hair loss has to do with a possible period of bipedal wading in a salt marsh in the Danakil region of Ethiopia, possibly occurring in the hominid lineage between 5 and 7 million years ago. As a wading animal, it was more efficient to develop short body hair and a layer of subcutaneous fat for streamlining and insulation in the aquatic environment; the eccrine sweat glands developed later after the hominids left the water; see Aquatic ape hypothesis. One problem with this theory is that both chimpanzees and gorillas have the same density and distribution of the eccrine glands, but that they have not been developed for sweat production. A third theory proposes that sexual selection played a role, possibly in conjunction with Neoteny, with the more juvenile appearing females being selected by males as more desirable; see Types of hair and Vellus hair. This would also explain the sexual dimorphism in human body hair. At this point the evidence is inconclusive as to the cause of the unique features of human hair.\n (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair) \n",

A study of evolution can lead the student to realise there is nothing divine at all about life and ultimately ourselves. At the very least it would cause a Christian to read Genesis as an allegory as opposed to an absolute truth.\n \n Once such a rationalisation is made then any part of the Bible is open to interpretation and re-appraisal. This is something that the YEC's do not like because they believe the Bible is the underlying truth to everything in life and must be taken as read. If not humanism will take its place (humanism being the #1 bogey-idea to the YEC) and undermine the absolute moral authority of the Bible.\n \n So when debating YEC's and other creationist types I always bear this in mind- its far less frustrating reading someone explain how the stratigraphy of the Grand Canyon supports the biblical flood when you know they don't really believe what they are trying to put across, but are using it as a tool to attack the philosophy of science.",

A good theory is one which is supported by the available evidence, has strong explanatory power, and has not yet been falsified by observation or experiment. That is as good as it gets in science; and on those grounds the theory of evolution is right up there with gravitation and relativity.\nI would add one more quality of a good scientific theory: it has predictive power. In fact, that is one of the ways by which an hypothesis is tested. A prediction is made about the necessary consequences of the hypothesis; some further observation that should be made or the outcome of some specific experiment. This is what makes a scientific theory falsifiable, one of the necessary characteristics of a scientific theory according to Popper.\n \n Hopefully, ender_krum is getting the picture. It is impossible to test an hypothesis in every possible case in every possible place in the universe. It is only possible to test it in one specific place under a fixed set of circumstances. When an hypothesis has been frequently and strongly tested, it becomes a theory. Both hypotheses and theories are explanations for the observed facts, the latter having been tested. However, every scientist is aware that there may exist a case that has not been tested that will cause a revision of the theory. Thus, there is always at least the formal recognition that a scientific theory is tentative, even though for all practical purposes some theories have been so well supported and tested that it is considered foolish to question the basic foundations. The theory of evolution is such a theory.\n \n On the other hand, creationism has no observational facts, it explanations are ad hoc, it makes few predictions, most being claimed predictions of already observed phenomena, and any real efforts to test the hypothesis have consistently shown creationism to be false. Surely, everyone would agree that a religious assertion should stand up to the most basic examination before it is used as the basis to reject science. It seems not to be the case with creationism.",

   "\n \n High school science classes will not cover any theory of the origin of species. Only that which is currently observable and repeatable will be included in science classes.\n\n \n Why? It's a theory of the science of biology, and it's taught in biology. It's science.\n \n What is your motiviation for suggestion science, be removed from a science class, and placed in a debate class?\n \n If you are motivated by:\n Public opinion\n or\n Religion\n \n Your suggestion is rejected on the basis that they have nothing to do with science, or the scientific classification of a scientific theory of biology into some other \"science\" class.\n \n History is the science of the past, but generally limited to human societies. Including a bit in a history class that covers the eras of life on earth is a good idea, but has nothing to do with removing a biological theory from biology. I suspect teaching how life obviously emerged on it's own, from nature, and evolved into life as we know it today, as \"historical\" would meet MORE resistance to leaving it in biology, not that it really matters.\n \n Philosophy is the science of systems of belief. That includes theology...\n Science is included in most philosophy courses as a system of gaining knowledge already.\n \n Important correction of your claim:\n All science can be tested today.\n No specific event of the past, say \"the occurence of A\", can be repeated in the present, without it becoming a new past, call it \"B\".\n \n For instance:\n Sam hit Gwen on the arm, and she replied that it hurt, she felt it, etc. (event A).\n Sam again hits Gwen on the arm, but because of the way physics describes matter/energy/space/time, Sam and Gwen are always different than they were at event A, thus, event A cannot be \"repeated\". It must be called event B.\n \n Likesise, even immediately after event A, observation must occur. After observation B, more observation must occur.\n Does the fact that event B took place after event A, somehow disqualify it as scientific observation? \n \n Of course not. When you get right down to it, your suggestion that \"However, these theories simply cannot be scientificly tested. It is these theories of the past\" is just a bad one.\n \n So, the theory that Sam hit Gwen on the arm, necessarily a theory of the past, is not acceptable? This is your \"reasoned\" debate?\n We can of course examine Sam's fist, and Gwen's arm, and through understanding of science, perhaps determine that he hit her. Would you also reject this? So forensic science, when we determine someone comitted a crime, is not science, but should be open to a worldview debate? That's nothing but funny to me. Actually, causation and time are PART of SCIENCE. To suggest they be removed from science is...simply not reasonable.\n \n And don't be upset that your idea was ridiculous, that's OK, we all have ridiculous notions, and will continue to, and it's through science that we rationally approach sifting out the good notions from the bad ones.\n \n -Mach",

Not sure how that works.\n \n If these short dictionary definitions aren't very good after all, then here is a longer one:\n \n A discipline is widely regarded as a science if its practitioners apply the 'scientific method'. According to falsificationists, this involves the formation of a testable hypothesis, followed by ongoing attempts to refute this hypothesis via critical reasoning, experimentation and observation. A hypothesis that has been rigorously tested under a wide variety of conditions, and which remains unrefuted, is tentatively accepted as a useful approximation to the truth, and attains the status of theory; future observations may yet refute it.",
