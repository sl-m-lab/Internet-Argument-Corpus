   "Poking Fun at the Tired \"Anti-Semitic\" Accusation\n \n You find anti-Semitism in the strangest of places - the Democratic Leadership Council, for example. Perusing the online pages of Blueprint, the DLC house organ, I came upon this filthy piece of anti-Semitic propaganda from Will Marshall, the head of the Progressive Policy Institute and a well-known DLC fellow traveler:\n \n \"As they catalogue the administration's many mistakes, Democrats should also attend to the other side of the balance sheet. That side shows that our forces and their allies have toppled one of the world's most odious tyrants; upheld the principle of collective security; liberated a nation of 24 million; made possible Iraq's hopeful experiment in representative self-government; and changed the strategic equation in the Arab-Israeli conflict.\"\n \n Dying in Iraq...for Israel's Sake:\n \n http://www.antiwar.com/billmon/?articleid=7084\n \n \n .",
