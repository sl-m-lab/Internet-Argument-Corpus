   "Posters comparing Barack Obama to Adolf Hitler are taped to a table at a town hall meeting on healthcare in Alhambra, California. Photograph: Danny Moloshok/Reuters\n \n The health debate in the US is taking an ugly turn with Barack Obama and other Democrats pushing reform being compared with Nazis and one congressman having a swastika daubed outside his office.\n \n The FBI is investigating the swastika that the staff of the congressman, David Scott, found painted on a sign bearing his name near the entrance to his office in Smyrna, Georgia.\n \n The police hope that the incident might have been picked up on surveillance cameras.\n \n The incident came less than a week after a rowdy town hall meeting in which Scott was involved in acrimonious exchanges with critics of Obama's proposed health reform.\n \n In a separate incident, police admitted they were helpless to do anything about a man who openly carried a gun outside the venue where Obama addressed a public meeting on the health issue at Portsmouth, New Hampshire yesterday.\n \n The man, William Kostric, held up a sign reading \"it is time to water the tree of liberty,\" an apparent reference to a letter written by Thomas Jefferson that the tree of liberty \"must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants\".\n \n Police kept close watch on him but were unable to intervene because the law in New Hampshire allows firearms to be carried in public. Police were also hampered by the fact that Kostric was on private property at the time, a church near the public meeting. Also outside the meeting, a woman held a sign with Obama's face superimposed on a Nazi stormtrooper.\n \n Such reactions reflect the emotions aroused by health reform, one of the most divisive issues in US politics of the last two decades. Meetings of members of Congress trying to sell Obama's call for health reform have frequently been disrupted. Some members of Congress have cancelled plans for further meetings but others pushed ahead today.\n \n Obama, trying to win back ground lost to conservative opponents over the last month, is to return to the fray on Friday and over the weekend with further town hall meetings in Montana and elsewhere in the west.\n \n Some recent opinion polls have suggested that Obama has lost popularity, down from the mid-60s or higher he enjoyed during his first six months in office to an approval rating of around 55%. But a Gallup poll published today found that opinions on healthcare had no significant shift over the last three weeks, with 49% saying they disapproved of Obama's desire to introduce healthcare reform and 43% approving. The poll was conducted last week. A similar one in the middle of last month had 50% disapproving and 44% approving.\n \n The congressman who had the swastika painted outside his office is to ask the police for increased protection for himself and his family. Scott received hate mail after angrily denouncing healthcare critics at a meeting that received widespread television coverage in the US. He told the Associated Press that the swastika was probably intended as a warning and expressed hope that it will persuade reasonable people to maintain a more substantive debate. He said: \"We must not allow it to intimidate us.\" \n \n The Anti-Defamation League condemned the swastika paint job as a \"frightening display of bigotry and ignorance that should not be tolerated by a democratic society.\"\n \n The incident came after the rightwing talk show host Rush Limbaugh last week described Obama's healthcare logo as \"right out of Adolf Hitler's playbook\".\n \n The campaigning on both sides will intensify over the next few weeks. Obama has set October as the deadline for having a healthcare bill on his desk for signing but in order to meet that the Senate will have to begin finalising work on the legislation by the middle of next month.\n \n As part of the intensification, the US Chamber of Commerce today began airing 30-second adverts opposing health reform across 20 states. The ad concentrates on concerns that the expansion of healthcare coverage to the 50 million uninsured in the US will stretch an already inflated federal budget. It shows a balloon bursting, and predicts big tax increases and huge deficits.\n \n Debate over US healthcare reform takes an ugly turn | World news | guardian.co.uk",

Is there something currently prohibiting doctors from talking about end of life issues with patients?\n\n \n The provision in question doesn't \"allow\" such counselling. It's already allowed. The provision in question would reimburse doctors for such counselling. Medicare doesn't cover such consultations, nor do most private insurance plans. Hence, even though they're allowed, most patients don't get them.\n \n Newt Gingrich knew all this when he wrote the following a month and a half ago:\n \n Health Care Rx: Across the Country, Some Systems Are Getting It Right - Newt Gingrich\n \n I here excerpt paragraph two:\n \n \"More than 20 percent of all Medicare spending occurs in the last two months of life. Gundersen Lutheran Health System in La Crosse, Wisconsin has developed a successful end-of-life, best practice that combines: 1) community-wide advance care planning, where 90 percent of patients have advance directives; 2) hospice and palliative care; and 3) coordination of services through an electronic medical record. The Gundersen approach empowers patients and families to control and direct their care. The Dartmouth Health Atlas has documented that Gundersen delivers care at a 30 percent lower rate than the national average ($18,359 versus $25,860). If Gundersen's approach was used to care for the approximately 4.5 million Medicare beneficiaries who die every year, Medicare could save more than $33 billion a year.\"\n \n Scary stuff! \"Community-wide\" -- oooooooo.... \"Saving billions\" -- aaiieegh.... \"Empowering patients\" -- bwa-ha-ha-ha-ha....\n \n This is all that the provision in the house bill is designed to encourage. No one would be required to seek out a consultation he doesn't want. And the government wouldn't decide his end-of-life directives: he would.\n \n But if someone wants to consult a medical professional about such directives, the provision ensures that this counselling is covered. The assumption is that more people would then do it, saving the system money -- and saving their loved ones from having to make agonizing care decisions when they're not typically in an emotional state conducive to making such decisions wisely.\n \n WHY IS THIS BAD?",

If they aren't, and it's left all up to doctors, we're no better off than we would be with private healthcare. Doctors will just bleed the system and prices will stay high.\n\n \n I guess I don't see why any of this is true. Neither Medicare nor private insurance companies \"leave it all up to doctors.\" They check for fraud. Why adding an additional point of coverage makes this any more expensive is beyond me.\n \n And of course, this still addresses the issue in terms of cost, rather than providing any specifics about increasing government control over individuals' lives.\n \n \nOh, and we'll have another giant govt program sinking money from our economy.\n\n \n You just aren't going to address anything specific, that anyone actually says, are you? Just generalities and platitudes.\n \n The provision in question is not \"another giant govt program.\"\n \n And of course... See above for the rest.\n \n \n the WHOLE concept of socialized healthcare represents more govt. control.\n\n \n Of course it would. But the plan isn't talking about socialized healthcare. It isn't modeled on Britain, nor even on Canada. It would not eliminate private participation in the health care market, nor even in the health insurance market; to the contrary, private entities would make up the overwhelming majority of both.\n \n And in any event, this is yet again to deal in generalities. I have asked you about a specific point, and you simply are not answering.\n \n Let's just suppose, for a moment, that Medicare reimburses doctors, subject to the restrictions of the provision, for consultations about end of life care. Suppose that you're on Medicare. You have an office visit with your primary care physician to discuss advance directives. For a couple hours, he explains various conditions and treatments to you, and what they would likely cost, and what Medicare does and doesn't cover, and what your options beyond Medicare are, and who you could grant legal power to make the decisions if you were mentally incapacitated -- everything. The meeting ends, and you thank him. He gets paid for his time, because Medicare covers this sort of thing. A few days later, after carefully considering all your options and discussing them with your family, you make your decisions and fill out your formal documentation.\n \n My question is this. How, in any way, does the fact that Medicare reimbursed the doctor for this meeting represent government controlling people's lives? That is what I'd like to know. And I want specifics, not just some vacuous statement about how government being involved at all means increased control over individuals.\n \n \nEr, in the context of the healthcare debate, it's [i.e., cost] pretty darn central. You can't have a real discussion of it without that coming into the discussion.\n\n \n Again, I have no doubt about this. But it's not relevant to the particular point at issue.\n \n Are you a baseball fan? I am. If someone asked me about whether a change should be made to the infield fly rule, I could respond by insisting that the game remain a nine-inning affair. If, perplexed, he pointed out that this is not what's at issue in his question, I could respond that the length of the game is centrally important, and even that this change to the infield fly rule is going to have an effect on how long games take to play, so my point was relevant after all. But somehow I don't think he'd agree.\n \n My point is this. I have no doubt that costs are important. And I have no doubt that having Medicare reimburse for end-of-life consultations would affect those costs. Indeed, as Newt Gingrich himself pointed out in his July WaPo piece (which I linked in an earlier post), its effect on costs will be to save -- let me repeat that for emphasis: SAVE -- Medicare $33 billion a year. But even that potential savings is not the issue here.\n \n To wit, one last time: You claim that reimbursement of doctors for end-of-life care consultations is just more government control of the individual.

   "I realize the \"death panel\" debate is like trying to argue with somebody on why they think a triangle has six sides, but I figured I would throw out some more information to show how childish Republicans are being on this.\n ESPECIALLY the queen of childish tantrums, Sarah Palin and Newt Gingrich.\n \n Cause you see, BOTH were advocating these types of consultation sessions BEFORE they started being against them...\n \n \nIn recent weeks, right-wing groups have been pushing the myth that health care reform will somehow kill seniors. One of the most high profile voices pushing this lie has been Sarah Palin, who claimed President Obama will institute bureaucratic \"death panels.\"  Today, again on her Facebook page, she continued the attack. Though some Republicans have rebuffed this absurd, inaccurate notion - like Johnny Isakson (R-GA), who called such talk \"nuts\" - others, like Newt Gingrich, have piled on to agree with Palin. \n \n However, on April 16th 2008, then Gov. Sarah Palin endorsed some of the same end of life counseling she now decries as a form of euthanasia. In a proclamation announcing \"Healthcare Decisions Day,\" Palin urged public facilities to provide better information about advance directives, and made it clear that it is critical for seniors to be informed of such options: \n  WHEREAS, Healthcare Decisions Day is designed to raise public awareness of the need to plan ahead for healthcare decisions, related to end of life care  and medical decision-making whenever patients are unable to speak for themselves and to encourage the specific use of advance directives to communicate these important healthcare decisions. [...] \n \n WHEREAS, one of the principal goals of Healthcare Decisions Day is to encourage hospitals, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, continuing care retirement communities, and hospices to participate in a statewide effort to provide clear and consistent information  to the public about advance directives, as well as to encourage medical professionals and lawyers to volunteer their time and efforts to improve public knowledge and increase the number of Alaska's citizens with advance directives.  WHEREAS, the Foundation for End of Life Care in Juneau, Alaska, and other organizations throughout the United States have endorsed this event and are committed to educating the public about the importance of discussing healthcare choices and executing advance directives. \n Though this proclamation is now deleted  from the Alaska governor's website, it shows that Palin's current fear-mongering is purely political . Palin is not the only conservative leader completely flip-flopping on this issue. Merely months ago, Gingrich too endorsed end of life counseling. At a conference in April of this year, Gingrich said advance directives can \"save money\" while also helping to \"decrease the stress felt by caregivers.\" \n\n \n Think Progress For 'Death Panels' Before She Was Against Them? Palin Endorsed End Of Life Counseling As Governor\n \n This is one of the reasons why the Republican party has a divide these days.\n I know there are a lot of Republicans who are smart and honest enough to recognize these tactics for what they are. It's part of the reason why so many Republicans find Palin to be repugnant, and don't want her to be their candidate.\n \n And on the other hand, there are also a lot of Republicans who embrace these type of partisan tactics. Who lack the honesty to admit what Palin and crew are doing.\n The really pathetic thing is that the American people are the clear losers out of the consequences of this. BOTH sides have agreement that people should be counseled on this option.\n It's just that the Republicans BLOCK it and throw out fear when it's the Democrats putting it forth... emoticon_frazzled",

Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said in a statement. \"We dropped end-of-life provisions from consideration entirely because of the way they could be misinterpreted and implemented incorrectly.\"\n \n The Finance Committee is the only congressional committee not to report out a preliminary healthcare bill before the August congressional recess, but is expected to unveil its proposal shortly after Labor Day.\n \n Grassley said that bill would hold up better compared to proposals crafted in the House, which he asserted were \"poorly cobbled together.\"\n \n \"The bill passed by the House committees is so poorly cobbled together that it will have all kinds of unintended consequences, including making taxpayers fund healthcare subsidies for illegal immigrants,\" Grassley said. The veteran Iowa lawmaker said the end-of-life provision in those bills would pay physicians to \"advise patients about end-of-life care and rate physician quality of care based on the creation of and adherence to orders for end-of-life care.\n \"Maybe others can defend a bill like the Pelosi bill that leaves major issues open to interpretation, but I can't,\" Grassley added. \n http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/finance-committee-to-drop-end-of-life-provision-2009-08-13.html\n \n\n \n Rating and paying physicans based on their \"end-of-life\" performance sure sounds like it could lead to death panels to me. Let's give Doctor Jones an extra $10k because he convinced granny NOT to get expensive treatment. emoticon_rolleyes",

   "Can you elaborate on the distinction you are making?\n Sure, in 2004 the budget deficit was -$413 billion and in 2005 it was -$318 billion. So the deficit decreased between 2004 and 2005. Total outstanding US debt in 2004 was 7.35 trillion and in 2005 was 7.9 trillion. This is true as a percentage of GDP a well (which I don't think is a wise figure to look at but every does). So that's what i mean :)\n \n \nI would disagree on whether \"one is better\".\n Republicans squandered a deficit when there was no need.\n Democrats are trying to help the economy.\n \n Although, I'm not going to hold my breath on the economics after the economy actually recovers. I don't expect a balanced budget for quite some time.\nThe republican congress and democrat president passed a \"balanced\" budget and a republican congress and republican president had huge deficits. A republican president and democrat congress had huge deficits and a democrat president and democrat congress had even bigger deficits. One president used the excuse of national security and this one is using the economy. Both times the debt is not justified because it is indefinite. Each Obama year will have a bigger deficit than Bush ever did...i think even after inflation. The lowest one is around $650 billion and chances are great that is a low ball...even more so if health \"reform\" is passed.\n \n So no, I don't think one is better either...they all are terrible and I refuse to vote for the \"lesser\" of two evils because you still are voting for evil.

The concerns he had.\n But less than a year later, he's saying it's the best in the world, which actually it isn't.\n Our EXPENDITURES rank one of the highest.\n The actual measurement of care RECEIVED is rather poor.\n \n In the end, I fear we're going to get something similar to what Clinton got on his healthcare.\n Similar to what Bush got on his retirement funding reform attempts.\n Partisanship will kill ALL potential progress, and the minority party will think they've achieved something. But they haven't...\n \n The two sides fight against each other, instead of fighting for a common goal.\n And the common man continues to suffer because of it...\nWell even you admitted that now isn't the time for health care reform. On that we agree. You seem to be looking at the reality in that we are here now so how do you make it work. If we look at that reality than face it all. The truth is, you can't win. If you want a huge central government this is the consequence. There is no such thing as people having a reasonable debate on this. There are over 100 million voters all with an opinion and less than 500 of them are supposed to make a decision on it. This is just never going to end well. Yet another reason for having stronger local and state governments. All that happens is lines in the sand are drawn and we come up with a solution that is almost always do nothing spend money. \n \n So the solution is not to get us all to work together but to understand human nature and get the federal government to a reasonable size again.\n \n Speaking of health care though, why doesn't anyone want to make it so you can get health insurance from any company with no state boundaries like we have now....kinda like car insurance. I recently got upset with State Farm who jacked up my rates because my driving record is perfect (yes, no speeding no accidents, nothing). What did I do? Switched to Geico and yeah, I saved $1,400 a year. I should totally be their spokesman now :)",

Good grief ....\n \n I made it clear in this post I was talking about the PUBLIC OPTION and the fact Obama is losing on it. \n \n \nFor the life of me, I don't get how some people aren't more understanding that government action is NEEDED.\n In the United States, we pay MORE for healthcare and see LESS in quality of results than many other nations.\n \n The lesson we can take away from last election cycle is that many, many Americans recognize a need for change, but they can be shouted down, scared, and cowed by many Americans who can spread disinformation.\n And then NO change happens. NO progress.\n And some people think that's a good thing... :xbanghead\n\n \n Nah. \n It's just that, if we're going to change things, we want change that WORKS and that we can AFFORD. The bottom line is, you're losing on this.\n \n It's high time some people realize that the American people didn't intend to give Obama some great mandate here to be instituting government-run options in healthcare compensation.\n The man only got 53% of the vote. \n It's no surprise that so many people aren't behind 'Obamacare'. It's why he's starting to compromise and suggest a co-op as an alternative. I for one would be MUCH more open to that alone.\n \n I'm reminded of when Bush tried to reform Social Security.\n It didn't work either, and he tried to assume a mandate he really didn't have.",

Part of the Republican party's problem right now is that it seems unable to debate without making such extreme distortions.\n \n Maybe that's why the NBC poll released yesterday showed that while Americans are not thrilled with Obama's approach to the healthcare so far -- 41% approve, 47% disapprove -- they're even less impressed by the Republicans: 21% approve, 62% disapprove.",

   "but don't you think, given our Congress's recent track record, that being unsure...and by unsure I mean really unsure and not just a few people disagreeing...shouldn't we have just not risk the money? I honestly think we need to tell congress that before we trust them again they have to prove they are competent and I hate to say this but the last time Congress did something somewhat rational was probably when we had Clinton and Gingrich (and that was minimal at best). \n\n emoticon_wow\n Even the Republicans believed in stimulus when THEY were doing it, with Bush in office.\n In fact, the Republicans voted to set aside some stimulus money that would be used under the next president. But then when the next president turned out to be Democrat, they suddenly complained loudly about it.\n \n The real source of the \"not sure\" lies in political partisanry.\n \n \n \nIn fact, going back to that budget thing in '95, if you read the articles from that CNN link you see a majority of economists and accountants felt a balanced budget would benefit our country in the mid-long term (5-8+ years). \n\n To put it in perspective, we're talking about doing what is best for the economy when it is HEALTHY, as compared to today's world when we're talking about what is best for the economy when it is NOT healthy.\n You wouldn't see a good doctor advising that a person severely sick should just be treated like he would be when he was very normal... \n \n \n \nThis was starting to be true before Bush screwed us over. So now we are back into a huge central government mode with unlimited spending. Maybe the right mix is a democrat president with republican congress ha.\n\n Or the right mix is people working for what is best for the country, instead of partisan crud.\n \n \n \nBecause the bigger an organization and the more they do the more people pay attention and take sides. It's hard to explain but almost human nature. Consider baseball as an example. The major league teams have strong loyalties to teams such as the Red Sox and Yankees. These are like Republicans and Democrats. No matter how good a player is on the Yankees a Red Sox fan will think he is terrible. Go down to AAA and AA baseball teams and people will like a team and prefer a team but they aren't rioting if the Norfolk Tides lose a playoff game. This is like local level government. Hopefully that makes more sense. \n\n I really don't see how that transfers over to what we're talking about.\n At the end of a baseball game, people's lives aren't directly effected. Their emotional ties THAT THEY THEMSELVES CREATED may be impacted, but nobody's lives are truly altered by the game's outcome.\n \n In the political world, if Republicans and Democrats don't work together, people's lives are negatively impacted when things wrong in the system don't change. When things don't get fixed.\n It would be like a few dozen people in the stadium going bankrupt as a consequence of the game outcome. Or losing their jobs.\n And the game participants didn't care, cause they just wanted the spotlight on them and how much they didn't like the other team.\n Sports doesn't have the impact upon people's lives that the government does. With the healthcare situation, people go bankrupt even when covered by insurance. Things need to change.\n And while the Republicans may be fixating on preventing the Democrat touchdown, the prevention of that touchdown has much larger ramifications than \"Yay. They did it\".\n \n \n \nWell even you admitted that now isn't the time for health care reform. On that we agree.\n\n Way to avoid the point.\n Palin and Gingrich WERE NOT arguing \"now isn't the time\" for doctors to advise their patients on living wills.\n Palin and Gingrich were MISREPRESENTING the democrat's plan.\n \n Furthermore, I recommend you review what I actually said.\n I am concerned over a large (i.e. very costly) healthcare plan under an umbrella of \"rush it through\".\n That doesn't mean the same thing as a simple \"now isn't the time for health care reform\".\n Cause I am sympathetic for WHY Democrats are pushing this. Because they know the Republicans have a tendency to stall and do nothing on the issue, being completely callous to the cares and concerns of the American public on the issue.\n Back when McCain was running for president, just look at his healthcare advisor's attitude at a time they thought the economy was okay.\n The emergency room was supposedly the way everybody got healthcare, and I've got tons of horror stories about people who were diagnosed when they were well enough to be preventatively treated, but then they couldn't afford it so they went to the emergency room LATER, causing MORE cost than the earlier treatment would have taken...\n \n And I'll stop right there, cause that alone should be an eye-opener.\n These people could have gotten healthcare EARLIER, and it would have been CHEAPER than letting the problem get progressively worse until an emergency room treatment was used that proved to be MORE COSTLY.\n And the patient still can't pay for the more costly emergency room treatment, so the hospital shoulders the debt.\n And the government may step in and pay for a FRACTION of that debt, but the problem is already worse than it would have been if treated initially. Both health-wise worse and financially worse.\n \n While I am cautious as to a healthcare plan, I honestly see an outcome where NOTHING gets done as much worse.\n And if the Republicans succeed in stalling this, that will be their outcome...\n \n \n \nYou seem to be looking at the reality in that we are here now so how do you make it work. If we look at that reality than face it all. The truth is, you can't win. If you want a huge central government this is the consequence. There is no such thing as people having a reasonable debate on this.\n\n I find your words poignant, but possibly not in the way you intended them.\n We can't look at this as a \"win\" situation.\n We have to look at it as a situation as what will make things better.\n And fearing a \"huge central government\" is kind of like saying \"I'm going to fear this animal over here, as opposed to this rampaging elephant I currently have running loose\".\n \n If you were to tell me to weigh fears of a huge central government, vs the healthcare fiasco we have today, I can guarantee you which one I would pick.\n We have one of the best capabilities for healthcare, with one of the worst ACTUAL APPLICATIONS of that healthcare to the populace.\n I am not going to put a fear of \"huge central government\" above my concern for my fellow man.\n \n \n \nThere are over 100 million voters all with an opinion and less than 500 of them are supposed to make a decision on it. This is just never going to end well.\n\n I was reading an article on Britain the other day.\n Britain has been in the news on healthcare since one Republican who didn't have a clue made a comment about how Stephen Hawking would never have survived with ALS under Britain's healthcare system.\n Except Hawking IS British. He was BORN in Britain. And he has lived there his entire life and he is quoted as saying that he is thankful to their healthcare system for saving his life.\n \n It brought out a variety of examples of support for British's support for Britain's healthcare system. Including a look at the HISTORY of it and how people feared it before it came into being.\n And that's what we have right now. People fearing what our system could be (in their imagination) without even really looking at it.\n \n Social security.\n Medicare.\n Medicaid.\n All large socialized programs that are used in our modern system.\n If you tried to tell somebody \"It's a huge government program, and we shouldn't have it. We should eliminate it\", you wouldn't get very far at all.\n \n \n \nYet another reason for having stronger local and state governments. All that happens is lines in the sand are drawn and we come up with a solution that is almost always do nothing spend money.\n\n I see the words. I understand the sentences.\n But I don't see how you arrive at these conclusions.\n It's like saying \"red and blue, thus 4\".\n \n \n \nSo the solution is not to get us all to work together but to understand human nature and get the federal government to a reasonable size again.\n\n In debate, there's a concept of \"inherency\" to an argument that some people fail to recognize the significance of.\n One aspect of \"inherency\" is for a person to explain WHY their desired outcome is blocked in the current system.\n And that is a HUGE problem with your argument...\n \n The federal government DOES NOT do anything to block \"smaller\" government implementation of potential solutions.\n A city or state government could have, ALL ON THEIR OWN, implemented their own solutions YEARS ago.\n In some ways, I think some states (liberal of course) have tried to help the people, while most more local governments did nothing.\n \n We ARE HERE today, with the current healthcare situation, which INCLUDES what local governments have done.\n I see a solution for the federal government.\n I'm not going to turn my back on that in order to hope that the local government suddenly does what it has failed to do all this time...",

I'm telling you this just will not happen and both sides will present \"fuzzy\" facts to get their \"win\". In the end you will end up with some medicare type plan that bankrupts us and doesn't improve health care at all.

He has signed more executive orders in that time than all the presidents since Roosevelt did combined, I believe. And the true evidence that our representative republic is doomed unless we the people take it back is that the free press is freely working with the enemies of our democracy in supporting this European style of socialism which Obama is promoting.

One camp believed that the new President was a pragmatic realist who would seek a centrist approach - disappointing his most liberal supporters, perhaps, but maximizing his personal political clout.A second group, including many conservatives, believed Obama was, in fact, the deeply liberal ideologue that his resume as a community activist and his past associations suggested. With solid Democratic majorities in the House and Senate, conservatives feared the Obama era would be a treacherous time for the principles of limited government and free markets.\n \n One hundred days into Obama's presidency, the debate is over. The President has now signed the most expensive spending bill ever passed by Congress; asserted government control of major banks and automobile manufacturers; diverted billions of tax dollars to individual mortgages; proposed a massive new role for government in health care; sought punishing taxes on the use of carbon-emitting fossil fuels; and submitted a budget plan that would explode the national debt to more than $20 trillion over the next ten years - even as he preposterously claimed that he did not believe in big government.\n \n So how have journalists reacted to this audacious liberal agenda which, if fulfilled, would inevitably push the United States away from our traditional free market system and towards a European social democratic system? A Media Research Center analysis of ABC, CBS and NBC evening news coverage of President Obama's first 100 days in office (January 20 through April 29) shows network reporters have failed as watchdogs, raising few doubts about Obama's agenda and showering every major policy initiative with positive press. While the networks have covered the President's individual policy choices, reporters have failed to focus on the massive shift away from the free market that they collectively entail. Reporters never once described his actions as \"socialist,\" nor sought experts to debate whether that correctly describes Obama's overall agenda. Indeed, TV reporters never once even used the term \"liberal\" to describe Obama's approach, arguably the most left-leaning in American history. Instead of presenting a debate about Obama's dramatic policy direction, network correspondents all but ignored conservative policy experts who disagreed with the President's direction.\n \n For this report, MRC analysts examined all 982 broadcast network news stories about President Obama and his administration from Inauguration Day, January 20, through his 100th day in office, April 29. ABC's World News ran the most stories (366), followed by the NBC Nightly News (315 stories) and the CBS Evening News (301). More than half of these stories (546, 55%) were full reports or interview segments that focused directly on the President or his administration; the rest were divided between brief, anchor-read items (182) or stories that contained a substantive mention of the administration, but did not focus on the President or his team (254).\n \n Not surprisingly, the main policy focus was the state of the economy and the various economic-related measures proposed by the administration. Nearly half (46%) of all Obama stories featured discussion of the economy, while about one-fourth (27%) discussed an aspect of foreign policy. A few policy issues that involved neither economic nor foreign policies - mainly stem cell research, the environment and ethics of administration officials - also drew significant coverage during the first 100 days. Table 1 shows the top policy areas featured in stories about the Obama administration during this period.\n \n While not the focus of this report, the networks also broadcast dozens of stories that treated the new President and his family as pop culture celebrities. First Lady Michelle Obama, for example, was the focus of 34 stories, all of which struck a promotional, positive tone (and more than half of which aired on the NBC Nightly News). The First Family's adoption of a puppy was chronicled in 12 stories, or more than were focused on the President's education policies (9 stories). While these stories contained no substantive policy discussion, their highly positive approach certainly added to the public relations glow that surrounded both the President and his administration during the policy battles of the first 100 days and beyond. \n The President's Economic Agenda: Liberal Government on Steroids\n \n The centerpiece of President Obama's first 100 days was his economic agenda, and the broadcast networks certainly chronicled the new President's interventionist approach. During just this brief, three-month period, the White House intervened to change the way business is done in both the banking industry and the auto industry. Obama fired the CEO of General Motors; instructed Chrysler to merge with the Italian car-maker Fiat; limited the pay and bonuses of executives at the nation's top banks; instructed banks to be more lenient to credit card holders; and constructed an elaborate program to use taxpayer money to subsidize the home mortgages of several million homeowners.\n \n As for big government, the President pushed through a huge $787 billion stimulus package, and proposed a massive $3.5 trillion budget for next year, projecting large deficits and a swelling national debt over the next ten years. The President announced he would push for universal health care coverage, adding more than $600 billion to his budget for that purpose, and suggested a \"cap-and-trade\" system of taxing carbon dioxide emissions that would cost each American more than $3,000 per year in higher energy costs and decreased productivity.\n \n In spite of this (partial) menu of initiatives, the networks failed to run a single story focused on the question of whether Obama's economic policies were driving the U.S. in the direction of European socialism. In the first 100 days, not a single network news reporter used the term \"socialist\" to describe how the administration was shifting economic authority away from the free market and towards government.\n \n On five occasions, the term was used in network news stories - three times in soundbites from sources and twice by reporters summarizing the views of Obama's conservative critics. In no case was the discussion of socialism more than a brief mention. The February 28 NBC Nightly News, for example, ran a clip of Newt Gingrich from CPAC, saying of Obama's policies: \"It is the boldest effort to create a European socialist model we have seen.\"\n \n Summarizing Obama's first 100 days on the April 26 Evening News, CBS's Jeff Greenfield acknowledged that the term was used by \"the right\" to describe Obama's policies, but also saw \"allies\" who \"like\" Obama for his leftist approach. \"The degree to which he sees government as an active partner in so many fields....is one reason why his opponents on the right are using phrases like 'socialist' or 'fascist' to describe him. They see Obama as a big government guy, and to some extent he's confirmed that, and his allies like him for that reason.\"\n \n Not only did reporters eschew the \"socialist\" debate about Obama, they never once labeled his big government, tax-and-spend approach as \"liberal.\" The L-word passed the lips of ABC's John Hendren and Dan Harris as each summarized how Republicans used it to describe Obama's big spending, as when Harris announced on the February 8 World News: \"Republicans are saying that this stimulus bill is a tired old liberal wish list.\"\n \n NBC's David Gregory used the label on the January 23 Nightly News to describe those who thought the President wasn't spending enough: \"This stimulus package has to do something that Americans are not doing, and that's pump money into the economy to get it moving again. Some liberals think you need more.\" And CBS's Chip Reid on February 6 said congressional liberals did not like the Senate's attempt to cut back some of the stimulus spending.\n \n Of the top seven economic policy initiatives that received major coverage during the first 100 days, all were given mainly positive coverage by the three broadcast networks - a far cry from the adversarial approach that dominated during the Bush years. Some topics, such as the big spending in the stimulus package and the budget, incorporated some Republican or conservative critics in stories in which the views of liberals, Democrats and the administration dominated. Coverage of other issues - such as health care, the banking bailout and the auto bailout - essentially excluded any conservative critics of Obama's big government approach.\n \n A rundown of how the networks covered each of the big economic topics during the first 100 days:Cheerleaders for the Revolution - Network Coverage of Barack Obama's First 100 Days",

For example, you can't buy health insurance across state lines. I could go on but your point as another flaw. People going bankrupt doesn't signify a problem with capitalism. In fact, it seems capitalism is working somewhat ok, given the regulation, in health care.

They actually gave the money back to avoid the regulations they were facing. This just makes my point even stronger. Thanks :)\n \n \nThere may be issues of difficulty, but by and large it IS STILL BETTER than without these systems.\nAnd you know this how? Give me a reason why having a bankrupt system is better than no system? How long can a country go with a bankrupt system? What do you think will fix it? Higher taxes? Lower benefits?

And it is run like a pension plan...granted a poor one. The only major difference is that you can't invest SS money like you see with normal pensions. Isn't this difference what Bush wanted to change by the way? Interesting. \n \n Anywho, you basically admit it isn't run well. You keep arguing that if the \"government just did things differently\"...well guess what!! They aren't! Again, there is no incentive to do it right so chances are it won't be. You keep wanting the fed government to work together and put politics aside and change the way medicare and SS are run to make it better but all the time you don't see the trend.

   "Capitalism checks this why government does not. Monopolies are anti-capitalism by the way.\n\n We are having a serious disjoint in how we perceive reality.\n \"Capitalism checks this\"???\n NO. It does not.\n The recent fiasco of bail-out vs bonuses should have proven your claim definitively false. I know a couple examples where a company was GOING BANKRUPT, and the execs were STILL seeking their bonuses...\n \n \"Monopolies are anti-capitalism by the way\"\n HOW does that supposedly work?\n In a capitalist society, monopolies are a VERY real danger.\n In OUR capitalist society, they are NOT prevented by capitalism but by the government.\n \n \n \nThis is just silly. I would tell God what I did to help the sick and hungry...I don't think saying \"I supported Obama's healthcare reform bill\" will cover it.\n\n I never claimed it would.\n But imagine if the Good Samaritan had a Republican nearby who tried to stop him from helping, like you are advocating against Medicare, Medicaid, etc, etc, helping those who are not as well off...\n It's not the \"I gave at the office\" mentality I'm talking about, but the HINDERANCE of those who are trying to help.\n \n \n \nYou are foolish to think I don't support improving health care. I just think government can only make it worse.\n\n emoticon_rolleyes\n Then what's your solution?\n Wish the capitalist fairy will somehow make things better?\n \n \n \nSeeing that now? It seems to be working great when we let it.\n\n Reality check.\n Medicare? Medicaid? VA? Welfare?\n All go away tomorrow.\n \n How does the capitalist market compensate to get those people help?\n \n Right now we have banks that are scoring some impressive returns while unemployment continues to go up.\n Why?\n A large part of that is because of credit card interest rates and bank fees.\n Things that do nothing real to \"service\" the consumer, but act much in the way that money changers did in Jesus' time.\n Did you ever stop to wonder why those people XXXXXX him off so much?\n The ONE TIME Jesus actually gets violent is at the money changers...\n \n \n \nIf you becomes separated from the needs of the consumer you go bankrupt...unless you get bailed out like GM.\n\n And are banks currently serving the needs of the consumers?\n Or is their money tightly wound in their own control?\n \n You really don't recognize what is going on out there, do you...\n \n \n \nMost importantly the health-care industry and insurance industry is heavily regulated. For example, you can't buy health insurance across state lines.\n\n Government interference is obviously not capitalist.\n It's a violation of capitalism.\n Moreover, you aren't addressing my point at all...\n I ask HOW DOES THE MARKET SELF-CORRECT, with EXPLICIT REFERENCE TO \"involving large segments of the population having NO insurance, and many more WITH insurance still driven to bankruptcy\"\n \n In actuality, you answered my question in your follow-on sentence, but you just don't recognize it...\n Steeeeve: \"People going bankrupt doesn't signify a problem with capitalism.\"\n You are proving my point.\n From a CAPITALIST point of view, people not getting healthcare and going bankrupt DOES NOT signify a problem.\n :xbanghead\n But from a HUMAN view (not fixated on greed of money =< root of all evil), those things DO present a problem.\n \n \n \nPeople going bankrupt doesn't signify a problem with capitalism. In fact, it seems capitalism is working somewhat ok, given the regulation, in health care. As linked in another thread about 90% of people are happy with the care they get..that includes people with and without health insurance.\n\n \"happy with the care they get\"... \n That's such a funny phrase, because it involves PERSONAL contentment.\n Cause you see, the people of New Orleans were happy with the levies...\n ... until they broke.\n \n I've talked to plenty of people who were \"happy with their health care provider\" ...\n ... but then others who actually needed help had horror stories they were willing to share.\n \n It's easy to be \"happy with\" what little you get...\n ... until you need serious coverage and actually need something non-routine from your healthcare insurance, and that's where the problems come in...\n \n \n \nWe give them loans they go back to the same practices. They actually gave the money back to avoid the regulations they were facing. This just makes my point even stronger.\n\n You are inappropriately blurring issues.\n Bank bailouts are not insurance coverage issues.\n \n \n \nAnd you know this how? Give me a reason why having a bankrupt system is better than no system?\n\n Why do you assume it has to be bankrupt?\n \n \n \nWhat do you think will fix it? Higher taxes? Lower benefits? Not only would we be better off without them but we would probably have better health-care for seniors with something else. Granted you can't just remove it now...you have obligations. \n\n \"better off\"???\n Again, we're back to recognizing those that are NOT better off.\n What you're essentially advocating is that we can't let any more people in the life raft, cause you think it will sink.\n So let's not even explore the option, cause a CAPITALIST solution the liferaft is the best solution...\n \n \n \nThe age actually just intensifies the problem.\n\n No.\n The age shift IS the problem.\n It's the REAL reason why people talk about Social Security and Medica__ going bankrupt.\n It's not \"intensifying\" some problem you don't even bother to name.\n It IS the problem.\n \n \n \nAnd it is run like a pension plan...granted a poor one. The only major difference is that you can't invest SS money like you see with normal pensions.\n\n Say whaaa?\n The federal government has included Social Security in their general revenue accounting for quite some time.\n There is no way in hades an XYZ Company would be allowed to mix their pension money in with corporate revenue. They would go to jail.\n \n \n \nAnywho, you basically admit it isn't run well. You keep arguing that if the \"government just did things differently\"...well guess what!! They aren't!\n\n :xbanghead\n Suppose we had computer program that was supposed to calculate a math problem in one minute.\n It doesn't, but mostly because the program is not run properly. It inefficiently wastes times in a long list of ways.\n Would it make more sense to deny the capability to create such a program by pointing to a program that doesn't work?\n Or would it make more sense to CREATE such a program that DOES work?\n \n The federal government CURRENTLY screws up some stuff.\n But the obvious solution is to FIX IT. None of the problems I am discussing are INHERENT to the approach of government involvement.\n And like I keep pointing out, the situation WITH government involvement is better than WITHOUT government involvement.\n \n \n \nAgain, there is no incentive to do it right so chances are it won't be.\n\n emoticon_confused\n I actually got fairly annoyed with the \"tea-parties\" cause they turned into a primary cluster-mess about PARTISANSHIP, complaining about an Obama administration, when the truth is that the Republicans were just as bad.\n \n The \"incentive\" is WE THE PEOPLE who need to take up that spirit of the tea-party in a SERIOUS and NON-PARTISAN manner to make the government fix its problems.\n FIX the lobbyist problems.\n FIX the government's capitulence to corporations over the American people.\n \n \n \nYou keep wanting the fed government to work together and put politics aside and change the way medicare and SS are run to make it better but all the time you don't see the trend. The federal government CAN'T do it correctly and never will.\n\n Again, we keep coming back to the situation where you want it PERFECT, and refuse to admit it is BETTER WITH the government involvement than without.\n \n \n \nOur founders knew this which is why they wanted them to do as little as necessary. You keep trusting them...I won't.\n\n Does the above sound like I trust them?\n No.\n \n I just recognize the difference between two separate scenarios, and will admit that the government involvement IS better.\n \n \n \nI commend you for actually giving Bush credit for something but this is yet another failure. Not just my opinion either. Clinton appointed GAO Comptroller David Walker called it \"probably the most fiscally irresponsible piece of legislation since the 1960s\".\n\n Gee.\n A democrat criticized a Bush initiative?\n How the heck did that happen???\n \n You're ignoring the proof that I offered.\n The ACTUAL RECIPIENTS have a positive recommendation.\n The ACTUAL RECIPIENTS have a positive recommendation.\n \n \n \nIt apparently did reduce costs for poor seniors and other seniors but also increased the number of drugs prescribed and increased the overall costs of drugs (meaning the fed picks up a larger freight). \n\n emoticon_rolleyes\n What is it about this situation that people don't seem to get?\n We currently have a nation that is NOT RECEIVING ADEQUATE HEALTHCARE.\n Too many people go WITHOUT healthcare...\n \n FIXING that will lead to what???\n More people receiving healthcare...\n \n That means an \"increase\" in \"the number of drugs prescribed\".\n And I would love documentation on \"increase the overall costs of drugs\", cause companies don't need any help spiking their prices to unreasonable amounts.\n In this capitalist nation, we have a LOW overall healthcare coverage rating that ranks BELOW other much less known countries, but we PAY MORE for what we do get...\n \n Again, GREED OF MONEY...\n Jesus pointed out it's the \"root of all evil\".\n NOT a way to fix mankind's woes...\n \n \n \nCan everyone in the US afford a flat screen TV? No. Does that mean we ration them? No. Rationing is when no one has a choice and someone else decides who gets what and when for everyone. \n\n By your very definition, you eliminate your own claim that rationing WOULD EVER become a reality in this country.\n The government healthcare has always been presented as AN OPTION for people to have, but they could still use their EXISTING healthcare system.\n \n Even if we were to assume that two years after implementation, the government option system would collapse, we would STILL HAVE the old system with the old adherents...\n \n By YOUR narrow definition of \"rationing\", healthcare would never be rationed under Obama...\n \n \n \nLike your friend Glenn Beck said, the US has the worst healthcare system other than all the rest.\n\n Just out of curiousity, do you REALLY listen to Glenn Beck at all???\n Like perhaps, back when he was at CNN???\n The hypocrite actually had to USE healthcare for himself back then, and his complaints about the healthcare system are archived for all the world to see.\n Complaining loudly about healthcare, and how it needed reform.\n Obviously not thinking it was better at that stage...\n Jon Stewart on Glenn Beck's Healthcare Hypocrisy | The Moderate Voice\n One of the reasons I find Glenn so repugnant is he has no consistency.\n \n You already seem familiar with Glenn Beck's praise, so you can jump to time 1:15 to see him complain avidly about our existing healthcare system... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n Glenn Beck: \"Getting well in this country can actually, almost kill you\"\n \n Jon Stewart: \"\"If only the ailing Glenn Beck 16 months ago (on CNN) had received the health care he's raving about today (on Fox).\" \"",

TOO capitalistic to the detriment of the people.\n I never claimed it was purely capitalistic.\n \n \n \nMisrepresentation? I never said he didn't host a tea-party. \n\n Obfuscation.\n I pointed out he hosted one.\n You tried to contradict me with pointless and meaningless side-chatter.\n \n Beck SUPPORTED tea-parties.\n Can you contradict that and say he did NOT support tea-parties?\n \n No. Of course you can't...\n \n \n \nI don't go by a soundbite I heard on The Daily Show. You choose to be that person and that is your right but that certainly makes you an uninformed typical American that Symbiote rightfully condemns.\n\n < yawn <\n And I don't go by your word as to how you try to categorize Glenn Beck and tea parties.\n And I have proven myself more accurate than your lame obfuscations...\n \n I use the Daily Show cause it's an amusing demonstration of the point.\n To date, you have yet to actually PROVIDE EVIDENCE for your counter-claims...\n \n Again, I invite the viewing audience to click the links and judge for themselves.\n You provide nothing...\n \n I put the Daily Show mounds above either you or Symbiote... emoticon_xgood",

   "Death threats are part of the job for any American president, but Barack Obama has reportedly had more levelled against him than any commander-in-chief in history.\n \n Concerns about his safety are mounting in the midst of a tense summer that has seen mobs of angry demonstrators showing up to protest Obama's health-care reform plans - including a man openly carrying a pistol today in New Hampshire, where the president held a town hall meeting on health care.\n \n It's legal to carry holstered weapons in the state, so long as they're not concealed. \n \n The man was also waving a sign that read \"It Is Time To Water The Tree of Liberty,\" a reference to the Thomas Jefferson quote: \"The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time, with the blood of patriots and tyrants.\"\n \n Footage of the protester with his gun in a leg holster rapidly made its way to various news websites in the hours before Obama appeared, alarming video in a country that has seen four presidents gunned down in public and attempts made on the lives of 11 others.\n \n \"There is, and rightly so, a growing concern about the tone in American politics right now,\" Cal Jillson, a political scientist at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, said today.\n \n \"It started with Sarah Palin and the way the crowds responded to her last year, and continued with the tea party gatherings and now the town hall meetings on health care - there is an arc of rhetorical excess that I think is rightly worrying to people.\"\n \n A new book, \"In The President's Secret Service,\" says Obama receives as many as 30 death threats a day, 400 per cent more than those made against his predecessor, George W. Bush.\n \n Its author, Ronald Kessler, has sent shockwaves through Washington with his allegations that the cash-strapped Secret Service is cutting corners, leaving the first African-American president in U.S. history particularly vulnerable.\n \n \"There's no question his life is in danger,\" Kessler, a veteran investigative journalist, said in a recent television interview. \"Tomorrow, Obama could be assassinated ... simply because the Secret Service was not doing what it used to do.\"\n \n TheSpec.com - BreakingNews - Obama: 30 death threats a day",

I can see how you would make that assumption, though, considering I'm a supporter of smaller gov't, less taxation, no social engineering. Unfortunately, those characteristics aren't represented by any party in power nowadays. We get to choose between liberal(R) and radical9D) now.

Whether abortion is or isn't \"murder\" is precisely the issue, so just saying that it is, isn't helpful.\n \n\n I agree to a point. We can surely agree that killing a viable fetus is murder, however, and since the definition of viable is a sliding scale based on the latest technology, I believe it's better to err on the side of humanity.\n \n\n Moreover, the gay marriage question is even more clearly circular. What is to be decided is precisely whether the legal definition of marriage -- not the sacramental definition, which is none of the government's business, but the legal definition -- should be changed!

If the general population wants to foot the bill to include gays in the \"married\" classification, it should be done via the ballot box. After all, the Federal recognization of marriage comes with a price tag. Until now, society has decided that it's worth subsidizing marriage in order to promote family stability. IMO, gays haven't made the argument that they deserve that subsidy.\n \n\n And in light of such circularities, I'd guess many people would say that being anti-abortion and anti-gay-marriage are perfect examples of using government to \"control the citizens,\" regardless of how we think in terms of right/left.

I just want to see why I should subsidize a relationship that doesn't further the goal of maintaining sustainability of the nation.\n That's not controlling anything other than my pocketbook and how my taxes are spent.",
