   "emoticon_wow\n emoticon_xgood\n emoticon_xagree\n \nSAN FRANCISCO - A federal judge challenged the backers of California's voter-enacted ban on same-sex marriage Wednesday to explain how allowing gay couples to wed threatens conventional unions, a demand that prompted their lawyer to acknowledge he did not know.\n \n The unusual exchange between U.S. District Chief Judge Vaughn Walker and Charles Cooper, a lawyer for the group that sponsored Proposition 8, came during a hearing on a lawsuit challenging the measure as discriminatory under the U.S. Constitution.\n \n Cooper had asked Walker to throw out the suit or make it more difficult for those civil rights claims to prevail.\n \n The judge not only refused but signaled that when the case goes to trial in January, he expects Cooper and his legal team to present evidence showing that male-female marriages would be undermined if same-sex marriages were legal.\n \n &#8216;Naturally procreative relationships&#8217;\n The question is relevant to the assertion that Proposition 8 is constitutionally valid because it furthers the states goal of fostering \"naturally procreative relationships,\" Walker explained.\n \n \"What is the harm to the procreation purpose you outlined of allowing same-sex couples to get married?\" Walker asked.\n \n \"My answer is, I don't know. I don't know,\" Cooper answered.\n \n Moment later, after assuring the judge his response did not mean Proposition 8 was doomed to be struck down, Cooper tried to clarify his position. The relevant question was not whether there is proof that same-sex unions jeopardize marriages between men and women, but whether \"the state is entitled, when dealing with radical proposals to make changes to bedrock institutions such as this ... to take a wait and see attitude,\" he said.\n \n \"There are things we can't know, that's my point,\" Cooper said. \"The people of California are entitled to step back and let the experiment unfold in Massachusetts and other places, to see whether our concerns about the health of marital unions have either been confirmed or perhaps they have been completely assuaged.\"\n \n Walker pressed on, asking again for specific \"adverse consequences\" that could follow expanding marriage to include same-sex couples. Cooper cited a study from the Netherlands, where gay marriage is legal, showing that straight couples were increasingly opting to become domestic partners instead of getting married.\n \n \"Has that been harmful to children in the Netherlands? What is the adverse effect?\" Walker asked.\n \n &#8216;Proof of no harm?&#8217;\n Cooper said he did not have the facts at hand.\n \n \"But it is not self-evident that there is no chance of any harm, and the people of California are entitled not to take the risk,\" he said.\n \n \"Since when do Constitutional rights rest on the proof of no harm?\" Walker parried, adding the First Amendment right to free speech protects activities that many find offensive, \"but we tolerate those in a free society.\"\n \n Walker made clear that he wants to examine other issues that are part of the political rhetoric surrounding same-sex marriage but rarely surface in courtrooms. Among the questions he plans to entertain at the trial are whether sexual orientation is a fixed or immutable characteristic, whether gays are a politically powerful group, and if same-sex marriage bans such as Proposition 8 were motivated by anti-gay bias.\n\n Judge challenges backers of gay marriage ban - Crime & courts- msnbc.com\n \n It's funny.\n I have been making these types of comments FOR YEARS to refute that pathetic attempts trying to give a constitutional justification for why the government should be able to discriminate against gay marriage.\n \n People have scoffed at the constitutional requirements of equality, but FINALLY somebody is addressing it.\n Now I guess the question remains as to whether enough people like Scalia will be on the bench to ignore it...\n \n On another note, it's also interesting to see the anti-gay side taken to task.\n They casually toss out accusations that gay marriage somehow harms straight marriages or society without justification. Some like Jyoshu actually toss out such arguments, and then try to ignore the existence of such arguments...\n And now that argument is getting scrutinized by the courts and is being taken to task.\n \n The anti-gay side performed pathetically.\n I expect the right will have the typically mindless accusations of \"judicial activism\" while ignoring the fact that upholding the constitution is one of the main duties of the courts... emoticon_angry",

If you want to convince me that Gays too should have their marriages recognized by the government,... to onus is on you to show me how that recognition is needed to improve the \"general welfare.\"\n\n There is even historical precedent to demonstrate the outdatedness of this approach of yours.\n Take Loving v Virginia. A \"legal\" definition of marriage was formed.\n The Loving couple challenged that definition.\n The courts did not require the Loving couple to show how their relationship furthered \"general welfare\". The truth is that NO married couple has to do that.\n Equal rights isn't about what we can do to help others with our rights.\n \n In the Loving v Virginia case, a clear path was formed by SCOTUS in demonstrating what the proponents of existing marriage law had to show in order to prove the law was constitutional.\n Your argument is something thoroughly alien to the actual way that the law and our constitution works with regards to rights in general, and marriage rights in specific.\n \n \n \nYou keep making the mistake in thinking that being treated with indifference is the same as being discriminated against.\n\n emoticon_rolleyes\n Come on.\n Let's not play this absurd pretense of a role.\n Gays are discriminated against by preventing gay marriage.\n We can at least agree on the obvious and recognize that.\n \n Whether the discrimination is allowable or unconstitutional is a separate question, but the fact that gay couples are discriminated against should not be in question... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \nAlso, just to keep this issue in perspective,.... how is it that you and the rest of your ilk are outraged by the definition of marriage being so ridged that it does not include same sex couples,.... yet you have (seemingly) no problem at all with the definition of \"personhood\" being interpreted by the government as necessary to deny prebirth children their rights to their lives?\n\n Perhaps I should just approach this issue with your standard line of \"agreeing to disagree\"...\n \n I'm sure that if we went farther with the \"other\" agree to disagree issue, maybe you could get more of a response on this issue...",

If certain judges are allowed to override democratically-enacted laws, what is to stop right-wing judges at a later time from over-riding democratically-enacted laws supporting SSM?\n\n First of all, on issues such as these, the courts are often coinciding with an EXISTING societal move in the first place.\n \n For Loving v Virginia, the margin was 3-to-1 against interracial marriage at THAT time.\n In the late 1980's / early 1990's, the polls on interracial marriage finally shifted to have a majority FOR interracial marriage support.\n \n Secondly, and more importantly...\n Stare decisis - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n \n \nEventually, after the initial fuss over Massachusetts died down, people relized the world didn't actually end and went about their lives.

When the anti-gay discrimination CANNOT SATISFY ANY level of scrutiny (including the lowest level), then your side fails.\n \n \n \n Wow.\n And there you go. You did just stumble upon words you don't understand.\n \n Your assessment is ridiculously false, and proven so by historical precedent.\n Romer v Evans.\n Lawrence v Texas.\n \n \n \n emoticon_xgood\n That WAS STILL 14th amendment application.\n \"rational review\" IS STILL a level of requirement for the 14th amendment.\n \n My gawd man. Your comments are hilarious.\n It's like you are trying to argue that black isn't a color, because it's not red or blue.\n And then you admit that somebody painted their house black, failing to recognize that your very wording admits that black is a color.\n \n Rational review IS a level of 14th amendment protection. emoticon_xgood\n \n Same back atcha...\n\n \n The above proves that you aren't capable of handling a constitutional argument, so I'm done here.",

   " It is the JUDGES JOB to overthrow democratically-enacted laws, if those laws violate the constitution. \n\n \n And can you explain how Prop 8 violates the Constitution? Should marriage equality be a legal principle? Yes. Is it? No. The Constitution offers no such right to marriage.\n \n \n And as for \"ammunition to the fundies\", I don't think you appreciate the fact that they don't need \"ammunition\" in order to start things. \n\n \n Yes but what you to relize is that there are a lot of people who are not oppossed to gay marriage who are very oppossed to judicial activism or the appearance of it. If there is a better way to accomplish your goal (i.e. legislative action), why not use that?\n \n \n But based on your commentary, I am assuming that you are against gay marriage then? \n\n \n Of course not. Personally I don't feel government should be recognizing any marriages as their involvement is really only a way to keep lawyers and judges imployed. But since I have a better chance of seeing a martian than I do of seeing government get out of the marriage business, I have no problem in extending recognition to gays.\n \n My only gripe is how the process is accomplished. If activists in Massachusetts had brought the matter to the legislature or put a measure on the ballot, you can be almost certain it would have passed. Gay marriage in Massachusetts would be legal, the entire anti-SSM fiasco would never have occured, and gays in over half the states wouldn't now have to be living under state constitutional ammendments.\n \n \n After the legislation was enacted, these anti-gay proponents quietly turned around and tried to get civil unions thrown out based on the enacted law which referred SOLELY to gay marriage.\n Just out of curiousity, did you complain about THAT judicial activism? \n\n \n I complain about it just as much as you do. Another side-affect of anti-SSM amendments which swept the country in 2004.\n \n \n Take Nebraska for example.\n They didn't have gay marriage before Massachusetts enacted it.\n They didn't have gay marriage after Massachusetts enacted it.\n Nothing changed as far as capability to get married.\n And nothing changed as far as rolling back the time-table in Nebraska for being able to get gay married. \n\n \n One example. Do I really have to list all the states which had either state laws (easily repealed) or no laws at all concerning SSM but now have constitutional amendments against it?\n \n \n So today, following your plan, how many states would have gay marriage?\n So today, following your plan, how many states would not have gay marriage? \n\n \n Okay, lets review. Currently Massachusetts, Conneticut, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, and Iowa allow SSM. Obviously we are all aware of the blow-up caused by Massachusett's law, enacted by the courts. Conneticut had their SSM implemented by the court as well but there was no blow-up. Looks like I give that one to you... Iowa also enacted SSM by judicial ruling but you can be certain a ballot measure will come up within the next couple of years and that won't last long. Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine all approved their SSM laws through the legislature. The response from those oppossed to SSM has been almost mute.\n \n You have to realize that the notion of majority rule is a powerful force. Not that this is always a good thing. Fortunately we live in a Republic with the guarantees of rights. And this brings me to my two main points on the matter:\n \n - Whether marriage should be a constitutionally protected right (Yes, I agree it should) is besides the point. The fact is it is currently NOT a right protected under the U.S. Constitution for anyone.\n \n - Excluding Iowa, it is likely that legislative or ballot measures to enact SSM in all the states that currently have it via judicial ruling would have passed. The result would have been the same and all the collateral damage of state constitutional amendments would not have occured.

   "And can you explain how Prop 8 violates the Constitution? Should marriage equality be a legal principle? Yes. Is it? No. The Constitution offers no such right to marriage.\n\n I'm sorry, but you don't know much about the issue.\n Marriage has been documented as covered by the 14th amendment in Loving v Virginia.\n There is no argument against that. That's a documentable fact.\n There is a right to marriage, recognized by the government.These statutes also deprive the Lovings of liberty without due process of law in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The freedom to marry has long been recognized as one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.Loving v Virginia\n \n \n \nYes but what you to relize is that there are a lot of people who are not oppossed to gay marriage who are very oppossed to judicial activism or the appearance of it. If there is a better way to accomplish your goal (i.e. legislative action), why not use that?\n\n Yeah. But typically, they aren't...\n Like I pointed out, LOVING V VIRGINIA had a nearly identical scenario.\n In my experience, the vast majority of people who object to \"judicial activism\" have absolutely no problem with the \"judicial activism\" of Loving v Virginia.\n \n Like with many issues of prejudice, the people opposing equality just identify a new reason to declare they are upset and demand acquiescence.\n But the truth is that it is a legitimate function of the courts, regardless of how \"oppossed\" some people are...\n \n \n \nOf course not. Personally I don't feel government should be recognizing any marriages as their involvement is really only a way to keep lawyers and judges imployed.\n\n If you seriously believe that, then you are seriously not recognizing the reality of marriage.\n There are over 1,000 rights and privileges associated with marriage that people use all over this country.\n I really don't think they utilize them while thinking about how it keeps \"lawyers and judges imployed\"... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \nBut since I have a better chance of seeing a martian than I do of seeing government get out of the marriage business, I have no problem in extending recognition to gays.\n\n That's reassuring.\n But by the same token, since the courts already have this function, is there any real point in granting gay equality by a mechanism that has been oft utilized by other discriminated against groups in the past?\n \n Those who are against gay marriage are typically against gay marriage regardless of whether or not the courts initiate the recognition or not...\n The \"I object to supposed judicial activism\" is typically just a ploy...\n \n \n \nMy only gripe is how the process is accomplished. If activists in Massachusetts had brought the matter to the legislature or put a measure on the ballot, you can be almost certain it would have passed. Gay marriage in Massachusetts would be legal, the entire anti-SSM fiasco would never have occured, and gays in over half the states wouldn't now have to be living under state constitutional ammendments.\n\n Like I pointed out, the situation in those states didn't really change.\n Gays couldn't marry before a legislation change against gay marriage.\n They couldn't marry after a legislation change against gay marriage.\n \n Do you not understand how history often repeats itself.\n When interracial marriage was first started as a potential reality, THAT is when states started adopting laws (all over this country) to preclude interracial marriage.\n I can list you state after state after state which adopted anti-interracial marriage laws.\n Want to guess as to when the first court ruling against miscegenation law was adopted?\n \n I'll give you a hint.\n It came AFTER the laws by quite a long period... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \nI complain about it just as much as you do. Another side-affect of anti-SSM amendments which swept the country in 2004.\n\n Is that just a convenient claim for you?\n Did you actually recognize the actions of the anti-gay activists after the earlier California anti-gay marriage legislation, and did you really argue against those efforts at that time?\n \n Or did you just find out about that just now...\n \n \n \nOne example. Do I really have to list all the states which had either state laws (easily repealed) or no laws at all concerning SSM but now have constitutional amendments against it?\n\n Actually, Nebraska is one of those states with a constitutional amendment.\n And I think you're missing (or avoiding) my point.\n \n The absence of the laws is meaningless compared to the fact that there was a de facto recognition of preventing legal gay marriage in those states without a law.\n \n Gays couldn't marry there before.\n They also couldn't marry there after.\n If gays could have married in Nebraska before the Massachusetts decision, that would be meaningful.\n But they couldn't.\n You can't lose a right you never really had...\n \n \n \nOkay, lets review.

Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine all approved their SSM laws through the legislature. The response from those oppossed to SSM has been almost mute.\n\n \"almost mute\"?\n Are you kidding me?\n \n Like I pointed out earlier, they had one avenue of complaint eliminated, but they still complained.\n You not hearing them is not a refutation of the fact that they DID complain.\n They DID form groups against gay marriage.\n \n \n \nYou have to realize that the notion of majority rule is a powerful force. Not that this is always a good thing. Fortunately we live in a Republic with the guarantees of rights.\n\n \"Majority rule\" can be a powerful force, but you have to recognize which force should come out on top when it comes to a majority wanting to discriminate (unjustifiably) against a minority's rights.\n \n I brought up the Loving v Virginia as an example.\n It was a case where the \"majority rule\" was thwarted.\n You get that, right?\n \n So the question comes forth.\n If a majority doesn't want minority equality, who should win?\n What conditions should decide the situation?\n \n Or should mindless complaints of \"judicial activism\" reign supreme without question...\n \n \n \nAnd this brings me to my two main points on the matter:\n - Whether marriage should be a constitutionally protected right (Yes, I agree it should) is besides the point. The fact is it is currently NOT a right protected under the U.S. Constitution for anyone.\n\n And before Loving v Virginia, interracial marriage was not a \"right protected under the U.S. Constitution for anyone\"...\n \n That doesn't invalidate Loving v Virginia.\n It doesn't mean Loving v Virginia was wrong in coming to the conclusion they did...\n \n \n \n- Excluding Iowa, it is likely that legislative or ballot measures to enact SSM in all the states that currently have it via judicial ruling would have passed.\n\n By this logic, you would invalidate the 1967 ruling of Loving v Virginia, and insist that people would have to wait TWO DECADES before having a chance with the opinions finally shifting to a majority granting interracial marriage.\n \n And even then, that's two decades for the POSSIBILITY.\n \n I earlier pointed out that a vast majority support[*]Gays serving openly in the military[*]Gay hate crime legislation[*]Gay discrimination protection\n Gays have had majority support for a LONG time. Even under Clinton (1992), we had a majority support for gays in the military.\n But even with that, the minority opinion claimed a victory in passing a law through Congress proclaiming that gays could not serve in the military.\n \n Why is it that people don't complain when gays are the majority, and the minority opinion (holding for discrimination) maintains control???\n \n \n \nThe result would have been the same and all the collateral damage of state constitutional amendments would not have occured. After a few years of people realizing the sky hasn't fallen you would see measures spring up in other states as well.\n\n Again, when was the first state law precluding interracial marriage?\n When was the first court ruling mandating that interracial marriage must be a protected right?\n \n The cause and effect you are talking about is not real.\n These legislation efforts would have happened anyways for their own excuses...",

   "It was easy to see interracial marriage bans as unconstitutional. They were discriminatory against a federally-protected suspect class, therefore laws banning interracial marriage were held to the SCOTUS' highest level of scrutiny. States had to PROVE that banning interracial marriage had a measurable positive benefit to the state's interests in order to overcome the inherent discriminatory nature of the laws and states were unable to make that argument based on fact.\n As I've stated before, SSM doesn't even come close to the level of racial discrimination. Gays aren't a protected suspect class, the SCOTUS uses only a rational basis and the states don't have to prove squat.\n\n \n \"History doesn't necessarily repeat but it sure does rhyme!\"\n \n It's (as you said) easy to see, both then & especially now, that interracial marriage bans were idiotic, not only discriminatory, but really really idiotic.\n \n Here's where history rhymes.\n \n This is the same o lame o level of thinking used in the eternal quest for legitimacy.

The court rejected the argument that the federal Due Process Clause encompassed a right to marry that extended to same-sex couples, noting that in Loving and its other privacy cases the US Supreme Court had recognized that \"[t]he institution of marriage as a union of man and woman, uniquely involving the procreation and rearing of children within a family, is as old as the book of Genesis\" (291 Minn at 312, 191 NW2d at 186). The US Supreme Court summarily dismissed the appeal \"for want of a substantial federal question\" (409 US 810 [1972]). Under Supreme Court decisional law, as far as lower courts are concerned, \"summary dismissals are . . . to be taken as rulings on the merits . . . in the sense that they rejected the specific challenges presented in the statement of jurisdiction and left undisturbed the judgment appealed from\" (Washington v Confederated Bands & Tribes of Yakima Nation, 439 US 463, 477 n 20 [1979] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]) and \"lower courts are bound by summary decisions . . . until such time as the [Supreme] Court informs (them) that (they) are not\" (Hicks v Miranda, 422 US 332, 344-345 [1975] [internal quotation marks omitted]). Thus, with respect to the federal Due Process Clause, we must presume that Loving did not expand the fundamental right to marry in the manner suggested by plaintiffs in the cases before us. This observation does not, however, preclude this Court from interpreting the New York State Due Process Clause more expansively. \n Hernandez v Robles (2006 NY Slip Op 05239) \n",

I didn't take such statements as truth either...\n emoticon_xdonno\n \n \n \nFootnote 4: Four years after Loving, the Minnesota Supreme Court upheld Minnesota's marriage laws in the face of a challenge brought by same-sex couples (Baker v Nelson, 291 Minn 310, 191 NW2d 185 [1971], appeal dismissed 409 US 810 [1972]). The court rejected the argument that the federal Due Process Clause encompassed a right to marry that extended to same-sex couples, noting that in Loving and its other privacy cases the US Supreme Court had recognized that \"[t]he institution of marriage as a union of man and woman, uniquely involving the procreation and rearing of children within a family, is as old as the book of Genesis\" (291 Minn at 312, 191 NW2d at 186).\n\n This has already been rejected on numerous occasions.\n \n A simple observation.\n Does the government EVER reject straight couples who can't procreate?\n Does the government EVER punish straight couples who marry and don't procreate?\n \n Furthermore, this approach is distinctly false in that the government does not recognize rights in order to further a governmental goal.\n The government recognizes rights because they are RIGHTS.\n \n Furthermore, I challenge you to quote ANYWHERE in Loving v Virginia which shows the court claiming that they are granting the Loving couple marriage rights because they can procreate.\n Such a claim is distinctly false.\n \n And more precisely, let's look at the statement in the ruling which prompted this \"footnote\"... emoticon_xangelNor does this exclusion rationally further the State's legitimate interest in encouraging heterosexual married couples to procreate. Plainly, the ability or desire to procreate is not a prerequisite for marriage. The elderly are permitted to marry, and many same-sex couples do indeed have children. Thus, the statutory classification here-which prohibits only same-sex couples, and no one else, from marrying-is so grossly underinclusive and overinclusive as to make the asserted rationale in promoting procreation \"impossible to credit\" (Romer, 517 US at 635).\n \n \nUnder Supreme Court decisional law, as far as lower courts are concerned, \"summary dismissals are . . . to be taken as rulings on the merits . . . in the sense that they rejected the specific challenges presented in the statement of jurisdiction and left undisturbed the judgment appealed from\" (Washington v Confederated Bands & Tribes of Yakima Nation, 439 US 463, 477 n 20 [1979] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]) and \"lower courts are bound by summary decisions . . . until such time as the [Supreme] Court informs (them) that (they) are not\" (Hicks v Miranda, 422 US 332, 344-345 [1975] [internal quotation marks omitted]). Thus, with respect to the federal Due Process Clause, we must presume that Loving did not expand the fundamental right to marry in the manner suggested by plaintiffs in the cases before us. This observation does not, however, preclude this Court from interpreting the New York State Due Process Clause more expansively.\n\n Do you understand what is being said here?\n I don't think you do.\n \n I am pointing out that Loving v Virginia establishes:\n 1) Marriage is a right.\n Period.\n That is unequivocable.\n It would help if some people would get that through their head. Especially when they quote Scalia who \n \n 2) Loving v Virginia establishes a test process which can be repeated on other issues.\n I simply repeat that test process, on another subject.\n I never claim that Loving automatically means gays should be able to marry, all by itself.\n \n I simply examine the claimed legitimate state interest of the gay marriage, in the same manner as Loving v Virginia.",

I know.\n If you lose, you'll just complain about \"activist judges\" which will convince noone...\n \n \n \n3: The 9th district (where this case is being decided) is the most overturned (by the Supreme Court) district in the United States...

The court has enough respect for the will of the people in California and the for the procedures (ballott initiatives) they took to amend their state's Constitution,.... to uphold the amendment. (my bets have been placed)\n\n And if you place your bets on that, you are going to lose.\n You don't seem to get that the 14th amendment DOES NOT RESPECT people's majority rule. That isn't a good enough reason...\n \n I have REPEATEDLY explained that at the time of Loving v Virginia, the opposition to interracial marriage had a THREE TO ONE opposition.\n Did the court \"respect the will of the people\" then???\n Nope!\n \n \n \nYou go right ahead,... just keep accepting the idea that the government has the right to define what is and what is not a 'person' and yet does not have the right to define 'marriage.'

Calling it \"indifference\" DOES NOT refute the fact that it IS DISCRIMINATION.\n \n You calling it \"indifference\" does not make it not discrimination.\n \n And the funny thing is that we can see you over and over again FAILING to provide any argument that it is not discrimination.\n Instead, you just give it a different label.\n \n Jim Crow laws were experts at that.\n It would still be discrimination against blacks, but the racists would give it a different label to try to persuade the gullible that it wasn't discrimination.\n It WAS still discrimination...\n And we both know that you cannot pose a persuasive argument for why it is NOT discrimination.\n \n \n \nthe government hast the right to draw the line somewhere. That means some variations of relationships will (in his own view) be treated with indifference. \n\n Your arguing style is to fixate on truisms which offer no actual refutation, but you pretend that refutation has been established.\n \n Yes. SOME forms of relationships can be constitutionally discriminated against as long as the government shows a legitimate state interest for doing so.\n But in the case of gay marriage, there is NO legitimate state interest.\n \n \n \nThat's not discrimination and you know it. Else you too would be demanding the rights for pligamists, bigamists and incestors to marry as well.\n\n This comment steps beyond your usual \"truism\" mentality to just go for strawman argument coupled with blind naivete...\n \n Polygamists, bigamists, and incestors are LEGITIMATELY discriminated against, with a LEGITIMATE STATE INTEREST involved.\n \n We are upholding the constitutional standard of requiring a legitimate state interest in cases of discrimination.\n \n And the pathetic part is that I can explain that to you, and you'll simply ignore it and keep on repeating the myopic comments you have routinely made...\n \n \n \nbut your careful wording tells me that you actually do understand the fact that the government has the right to draw the terms (article 1 section 8) and that it is not an act of 'dicrimination' to reward or incentivize one behavior that serves the 'general welfare' responsibilities of the government....\n\n That also was not a truism, but just plain false understanding of reality.\n I frequently come across people who \"define\" the word \"discrimination' so that it only is discrimination IF YOU APPROVE, and it's not discrimination IF YOU DO NOT approve.\n \n As an example, a racist would not see it as discrimination to prevent a black man from voting, because he approves of such a move. He could even imitate your comment of \"article 1 section 8\" and pretend it means something significant to the denial of rights, as he ignores the 14th amendment which clearly puts limitations on such pretenses of interpretations.\n \n Preventing gay marriage IS discrimination.\n \n The humorous thing here is that NOT ONCE have you come out and USED the meaning of the word \"discrimination\" to pretend it isn't.\n \n Instead, you try oblique arguments like claiming that it is \"indifference\", and then pretending that it somehow negates classification of \"discrimination\".\n Which it doesn't.\n Instead, you try to pretend that if we thought it was discrimination we would have to supposedly fight against every non-recognized form of marriage.\n Which is completely nonsensical. Not even the opponents of interracial marriage legislation in 1967 who fought for equal rights thought that EVERY OTHER form of marriage had to be recognized.\n I have asked you time and time again if the people who fought for interracial marriage equality would have to be for gay marriage as well, otherwise their fight wasn't real.\n Another argument you habitually ignore...\n \n \n \nIndifference is not an act of discrimination.\n\n It can be.\n \n Case in point which I recognize you'll cower from addressing...\n In the early 1960's, many states refused to recognize interracial marriage. It was illegal, like gay marriage is today.\n One could easily say that the states were \"indifferent\" to interracial marriage, as you argue regarding gay marriage.\n \n Since Loving v Virginia was contingent on recognizing the discrimination, do you think that they got it wrong?\n Were miscegenation laws simply \"indifferent\" and not \"discrimination\" like SCOTUS recognized?\n \n Or is this another case where you will claim that you are much more interested in abortion debates, ignore the question, and then continue posting incessantly on these threads... emoticon_xdonno\n \n \n \nThe fact is; Neither voting nor the Government recognition of a marriage is a non conditional right. There are requirments for voting same as there are government requirments for getting married. Same goes for many other aspects of our (so called) rights.\n Same as it ever was!\n\n This has already been addressed.\n Those \"requirements\" (as you put it) are contingent upon 14th amendment restrictions mandating a legitimate state interest.\n \n You can't simply say \"it's a requirement\" and that somehow voids the issue.\n That's a nonsensical approach.\n emoticon_wow\n \n If that were the case, we would simply tell the Jim Crow opponents that \"reading is a requirement\", and the courts would not have been able to touch the law... emoticon_xdonno\n \n One of the areas where anti-gay rights activists fail on these issues is that they CANNOT apply their standards unilaterally, otherwise they would recognize that MANY black equality civil rights efforts would have failed if the argument the anti-gay rights activists attempt were held true...\n \n In conclusion, let me finish with some words which would leave any RATIONAL person to abandon this \"indifference\" / \"it's a requirement\" nonsense...\n It doesn't matter how many different times you try to use a different word, it does not negate the situation...\n \n While the state court is no doubt correct in asserting that marriage is a social relation subject to the State's police power, Maynard v. Hill, 125 U.S. 190 (1888), the State does not contend in its argument before this Court that its powers to regulate marriage are unlimited notwithstanding the commands of the Fourteenth Amendment. Nor could it do so in light of Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390 (1923), and Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535 (1942).Loving v Virginia.\n \n The 14th amendment applies to laws limiting who can legally marry.\n Get over it already...",

When you can see the beginning of a belly-button, a head, when it has a head, arms, leg, and back?
