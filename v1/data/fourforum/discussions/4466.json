We already know that british intel folks were basically told to mirror the Americans position. Beyond the Americans, israelis and british, nobody out there was really reporting the saem thing we were seeing.\n \n This, of course, begs another question. On the one hand, Bush had intelligence from Iraqi defectors who stood to gain a ton from Saddams overthrow. He had no sattelite data to back their position up. On the other hand, he had reports from our hand picked UN inspectors, who had been in country for years, inspected everything rom military installations to private homes, and they were giving Iraq a clean bill of health as far as the WMD issue goes.\n \n It should be clear to any right thinking person that thre is a descrpancy between this data. It should also be clear that any reasonable person is going to go with the data from our hand picked people who are on the ground looking in all the alleged WMD locations. \n \n Bush, though, went with the intel from Iraqi defectors.\n \n So, at BEST, he is a liar who pushed his own agenda and used faulty intel as an excuse to push that agenda.

   "Now that fear created by our actions and expanded by our government has become an American way of life, they have further no need for deception. Rulers only have two successful methods of dominance; fear and prosperity. The general public has seemingly been successfully refocused.\nVery true. We rode the prosperity horse to death by piling on more debt that it could carry, and now we continue with fear as as a justification for such folly. Some point to one political party over another as the primary villain in our economic tragedy while others seem to think that a particular label will suffice to explain our lack of fiscal sanity. People, the R's and the D's and the C's and the L's are there to get reelected and they do that by sending pork home and avoiding the hard decisions that will cost them votes from their constituents who are generally clueless.\n One man (one of few) in government that I admire does not clean up his statements or play politics. He is David Walker, Comptroller General of the United States. Here's what he said recently, \"The United States of America's public finances are a shambles and are getting rapidly worse. The truth is that the United States faces a long-term deficit that will only increase as the baby boomers retire. The resulting physical imbalance will test the nation's spending and tax policies.Washington's recent difficulty in maintaining fiscal restraint has not helped matters. I don't like using words that are overly inflammatory. At the same time, I think that it is critically important that the American people, as well as their elected representatives, get a better understanding of how serious our situation is.\n The sooner we start fixing this, the better because right now the miracle of compounding is working against us. DEBT ON DEBT IS NOT GOOD. We have to first stop digging, and then figure out how we are going to fill the hole. The thing that is frustrating is that you can talk to people and point to things. but that's all you can do.You can lead them to water, but they have to drink. And they better start drinking fast -- and soon.\"\n What this man said is known by the elected, but it is going to take a lot more voices than his to make something happen, and sheep have little to say.\n Dono",
