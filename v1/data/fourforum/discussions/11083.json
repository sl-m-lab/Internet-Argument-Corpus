I also do not think schools, churches and businesses -- or the people employed or volunteering there -- should even be giving away chocolate to American or British children produced by African children who are slaves.\n \n IOW, I hope folks will think twice about what's being handed out at their local Easter egg hunts et al. Even if they didn't buy it directly themselves. What their children or grandchildren are consuming. What the Easter Bunny really put in their baskets.",
