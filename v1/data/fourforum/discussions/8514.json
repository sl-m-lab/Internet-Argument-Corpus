   "Home for mentally disabled ordered to pay for discrimination\n \n \n SAN JOSE, Calif. - A boarding home for mentally disabled homeless people has been ordered to pay $8,200 in damages for discriminating against a lesbian.\n \n Nora Jensen, now 30, moved into the New Beginnings home in April 2003 after treatment for bipolar disorder, according to the state Fair Employment and Housing Commission.\n \n Jensen said she mentioned to manager Juanita Prunty that she was upset because she had broken up with her domestic partner. Prunty replied that she \"could not relate\" because \"homosexuality is an abomination,\" according to the commission.\n \n The commission said Prunty also prohibited Jensen from using the women's bedroom before 8 p.m. to eliminate the chance of sexual activity with another woman.\n \n \"It's just not right to be calling people an abomination,\" Jensen said. \"It's not right to be telling them what they should and shouldn't be doing. She made me feel like I was 3 inches tall.\"\n \n New Beginnings said Prunty's statement that \"homosexuality is an abomination\" was protected freedom of religion.\n \n But the commission said in a decision made public this week that Prunty was required to treat residents equally.\n http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/local/states/california/northern_california/15048022.htm",

Other teachers working in the school may not even be aware that the discrimination is taking place. Should they be aware, they are at fault for not attempting to solve the problem, and should in turn be sued as well.\n \n Criminal actions committed by an individual are not seen as representative of any organization they work for (with the exception of organizations that promote such actions, like a terrorist faction). If, for example, the CEO of a company uses his job as a means to steal millions of dollars, the entire company would not be charged with the crime. Instead, only the handful of individuals who helped the CEO in his crime or turned a blind eye to his actions would be charged.\n \n I believe it is no better to sue an organization for the torts of one person than it is to charge an organization for the crimes of one person.",

   "Anything could make it worse. There's no guarantee that anything ANYONE says will do any good for someone with bipolar, or that it wouldn't make them worse off.\n\n Yeah.\n So let's throw all caution to the wind and criticize the woman with bipolar disorder. And if she commits suicide, we can all have a clear conscience that \"anything\" could have set her off and it wasn't necessarily the manager calling homosexuality an \"abomination\".\n \n Try asking one of your \"counselor\" acquaintances about this case. Ask if they think the woman should have been criticized in such a harsh manner with the ONLY obvious objective being for the manager to express himself...\n \n \n \nThe opinion the manager gave is completely independent of all that. If he gave the right counsel about bipolar disorder, then he did the right thing, regardless of what he said about homosexuality. However, because homosexuality is not an abomination, the manager should not have said that.\n\n Don't you see that you are invoking YOUR OWN PERSONAL OPINIONS into this matter in where to draw the line.\n The manager may believe whole-heartedly that homosexuality is an \"abomination\", but you don't want the manager to say that because it is YOUR OPINION that it isn't, but rather just the act that is...\n \n Anyways, the judge disagrees with you.\n This one should be a no-brainer for anybody who is actually concerned about her condition.\n \n But not you. \"Anything\" could set her off in your book, therefore it's obvious that \"anything\" (but calling homosexuality itself an abomination) is okay in your book...\n \n \n \nAbsolutely not. And neither do you. Or are you going to tell me that you know what would be harful or not to someone with bi-polar? Where's your MD from?\n\n It's amazing how you will sit there and come up with ALL SORTS of convenient conjecture for your side of things in your opposition to gays...\n But when it comes to criticizing a bipolar woman in a callous manner, you can't fathom how that would harm her unless a doctor tells you...\n \n You are unbelievable...\n \n \n \nWhat they see is what they see. It may not fit with your worldview, but it's what they see.\n\n Fine. Then PROVE it...\n \n Oh wait. You're not going to \"prove\" anything.\n You're going to TWIST it into demanding that I DISPROVE their claims instead of asking them to prove their claims...\n \n Wait for it... \n \n \n \nThe idea that it can't be linked to it is unproven. These people see it every day. Whether you realize it or not there's sometimes a disconnect between acedemia and the real world.\n\n So instead of YOU SUPPLYING THEIR PROOF for how they are linked, you suddenly demand others DISPROVE the link.\n Or rather, you claim that it \"can't be\" disproven.\n \n Well, unfortunately for you it HAS been disproven. By the APA and a slew of other professional medical and scientific organizations.\n \n And it's not a matter of \"PC\". It's a matter of research and facts.\n And you have presented NONE for explaining why your \"counselor\" friends believe it to be linked.\n \n \n \nWell, you're back to Mr. Hyde, right on schedule. Let me know when Dr. Jekyll is back and I'll continue with you.\n\n Funny.

However, recent studies have confirmed that stress can cause episodes in all phases of bipolar disorder.8\n \n Some stressors simply cannot be avoided, but you can do your best to change what you can. Knowing what kinds of situations, events or behaviors that may be troublesome for you can help you to steer clear of certain circumstances and/or develop coping strategies when they can't be avoided. At the very least, by recognizing that certain stressors may trigger an episode of illness, you and your loved ones can make an effort to recognize times when you may be at increased risk for a recurrence of illness.8\n http://www.seroquel.com/cons_bip/seroquel/take_control/reduce.asp\n \n The manager stressed the lesbian unnecessarily. There was no point to it other than another anti-gay person pounding their chest at the gays and proclaiming that they disapprove.\n \n The manager is managing a boarding home for homeless mentally ill people, and as such the manager SHOULD HAVE KNOWN better.\n But in the end, the manager went with his prejudice and made matters worse for this lesbian instead of HELPING this woman and giving her the best care possible.\n \n While Jyoshu is incapable of admitting the obvious, I'll leave it for the rest of you to realize that this \"gap\" has been adequately filled in...",
