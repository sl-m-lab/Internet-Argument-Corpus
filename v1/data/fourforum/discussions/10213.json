   "I found out about this event called The Ultimate Fighting Championship in 1993-94, in a martial arts magazine ad. I didn't catch the first one, but my friend somehow got a copy of UFC 2 on VHS. I've always been interested in fighting since I was very young, probably because of all the kung-fu movies my dad watched. I took kung-fu and kickboxing classes when I was very young, but I always wondered what the best art was, who would really win in a real fight. That is what the early ufc's were all about. Which style was the best. I found out that grappling or Jiu-Jitsu was. Royce Gracie, a relatively small man, compared to his 200+ opponents, dominated everyone. I was hooked. \n \n On another note, I've always been the kind of person who hated conforming with the norm. If everyone was wearing khaki's, I wore baggy blue jeans. If everyone was listening to rap music, I listened to punk rock. I hated being like everyone else. I still do.\n \n Anyway, back to the topic. I've been keeping up with MMA since I started watching, I know all the stars, all the organizations, everything. In the last couple of years, my sport has gotten very, very popular due to added rules(which I agree with), and a reality TV show called The Ultimate Fighter.\n I've watched the sport grow and become accepted by mainstream audience which means I get to see more fights, but also have to put up with the new breed of fans.\n If you are at or watch a live show, you will understand what I mean. These people boo everytime the fight goes to the ground. They don't have any respect for what is actually going on inside the cage or ring. Personally, if you are willing to get inside a cage, and fight someone whose only intentions are to knock you out or make you submit to them, you get my respect automatically. But most don't see it that way.\n I love this sport, I think about it day and night, I am emotionally attached to some fighters, I almost had a full blown panic attack when Mirko Filopovic got knocked out recently from a head kick. But I am really considering giving up this sport because of the people it attracts. I don't want to be an #######, guy who thinks he's tough cause he watched a fight last night. \n I sometimes want this sport to go back underground, where just a few of us real fans watch. Tell me what you guys think. thanks.",
