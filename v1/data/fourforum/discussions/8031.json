   "Senator Byrd made the following statement \"$397,000,000,000 dollars. Can you even fathom how much money that is. It is $397.00 dollars for every minute since Jesus's birth up to today. Every minute!\"\n \n I have been thinking a lot about this statement. What one gets from it is in the eye of the beholder. One may see a religious statesman, one may see a corrupt politician using Jesus as a means for re-election. Most others may think about the direct statement of how much money this war is costing us.\n \n Have you seen the response to hurricane Katrina? Our government could do nothing except watch in horror as chaos was the leader of the people during that awful disaster. What a powerful statement to suggest that in the eyes of disaster our governments reach cannot penetrate the anarchy that follows a disaster of this kind of magnitude.\n \n recently was the 20th anniversary of the Nuclear meltdown that happened in Chernobyl.Our government has confided in us that a nuclear bomb hitting US soil is not a matter of if, but when. Can you imagine what kind of impact a nuclear disaster like that would have on the people of America? Imagine a response team that can do nothing as the media exploits their inability to respond to a massive, wrath of god type of disaster such as Katrina, and Combine that with the nuclear fallout that will last our lifetime if not longer. Imagine The greed of the businesses that will take advantage of the American people with their prices. Imagine The corrupt politicians that will use our own personal fears against us for selfish gain and power. Can you imagine that a nuclear bomb could show us that when America faces tribulation we respond with greed, and curruption? It is a scary thought that this corruption that is already here has the potential to do more damage than a nuclear bomb ever could. A nuclear bomb effects an area of about 30 square miles. Curruption and greed however effect the entire nation and can bring Americas values and beliefs to there knees if noone stands up against it.\n \n One may ask \"How do we fix it?\" My thought are that the ones who wish us harm hold an idea. You cannot shoot bullets at an idea because it is equivalent to trying to light a wet match. An idea of hate can only be fought with an idea of love and true compassion. Americas ideas are being loaded into our weapons and fired at our enemies. The compassion that America once stood for was the compassion of the lord himself. the compassion of the lord God almighty is not found in bullets. The compassion the lord God almighty cannot be felt by most men because they themselves are hatefilled and ignorant. The compassion of the lord God almighty is to forgive those, and loves those that wish us harm and ill will. For even Benjamin Franklin once said \"A man forced to agree against his will is of the same opinion still.\" When we impose our ideas on another we walk away holding onto our original belief even stronger than when we first began to quarrel. In the end all we need is another's goodwill, for that is most important.\n \n Corrupt civilizations fall. History has proven this. The idea of communism is good. The execution of the idea of communism is bad when put in the hands of another human being. Another human Whose only intent is for self improvement and self gratification. The ideas conflict with each other and when that happens it is sure to have a negative influence on future generations. Certain truths are self evident as long as they are spoken from the heart. The heart knows it is wrong to kill even if the person has never witnessed or heard of a murder. Universal morals and ethics do not apply to the man made world of politics. In politics the only truth is the truth of the majority. therefore it is my belief that truth also is in the eye of the beholder.",
