   "My opinion is that illegal immigration is a major issue facing America today. Although it would be great if we could handle accepting the influx of hundreds of thousands of individuals looking to make a better life for themselves here in America, the fact is that our economic system is not able to do that. The flow of immigrants has to be controlled if the system is to work and currently illegal immigrants are crossing our borders and bypassing that system.\n \n Eventually there will need to be a solution put into place to solve this problem. There are plenty of ideas out there ranging from opening the border to anyone who wants to come here to giving legal citizens the right to kill citizens here illegally. The best answer is somewhere in the middle.\n \n Feasibility is a problem when trying to deal with this large of a problem. There are maybe 5-10 million illegal immigrants already living in the US. They have settled in areas all over the United States and have become important parts of our economic structure in some areas. Also there are millions more that are trying to get over the border into the US and we have only minimal forces in place to prevent them from crossing.\n \n Also the political question of how to go about this will have to be addressed. With the Hispanic population in the US now greater than any other minority, politicians will be cautious when addressing this issue. The Hispanic population is also growing faster than any race in the US and at its current rate along with the immigration will eventually become the majority in the US in about 100 years.\n \n Then there is the economic and policing issue. California has a major immigrant problem and is currently losing a great deal of money trying to support the immigrants that live there. Illegal immigrants are also causing a great deal of crime as 1 in 10 of them are caught committing a crime, far larger ratio than the legal citizens. As the problem grows, crime is likely to increase and a drag on our economy is likely to increase. However, this has been a problem for many years now and it probably won't become extremely damaging to our economy as a whole or our criminal system as a whole for some time.\n \n So what should be done about this problem? Or don't you see it as a problem at all? If you were president, what would you do to solve this? Do you think that it will ever get resolved? Are you at all concerned about the growing number of illegal immigrants in the US?",

Let me quote something for you here.\n \n \n\"Feasibility is a problem when trying to deal with this large of a problem. There are maybe 5-10 million illegal immigrants already living in the US.\"\n\n \n OK, now you were only responding to the \"Feasibility is a problem\" part of that section and you got the impression I meant feasibility as it pertains to guarding the border. As you can see, I didn't mean that at all. I meant the feasibility of dealing with the illegals already here.\n \n \nThey shed loyalty to their homeland and embrance our country.\n\n \n To some extent. If their families still live elsewhere then they will provide money to them. Billions of dollars are shipped across our borders every year because of this and it is a prime reason why Mexico is trying to slip even more illegals across the border. Mexico's government is making money off this deal and therefore is very supportive of it.\n \n I'm not sure if you know my policy on it so I'll lay it out quickly. I support legalizing the current illegals here and following that by closing down the border with a style similar to what you laid out with the addition of more men guarding the border.",

Illegal immigratants in this country live on the margins of our society. Naturalization is a process that takes time and must be done as an open member of our society. Illegal immigrants never become naturalized. They stay forgein. I do not want forgeiners in this country with forgein views of government and society changing OUR ideas of government and society. I don't care what country your from, if your from France here illegally, become legal, then your a French forgeiner living here. I want that immigrant to become americanized. All over the world people suffer because thier homeland is full of corruption and have an inefficient government. If your French and stay French, live in this country, you keep your notions of government and society. I don't want the rest of the world to bring their notions of corruption, government, and society here to this country. Plus you do not have a choice of who we want when we do a blanket legalization. I want other countries college educated, skilled tradesmen, and professionsals. When you do a blanket legalization, you do not choose who lives here.

Please expand on this.\n \n \nKick the current illegals out of this country and take the best prospects from their homeland.\n\n \n Like I said earlier, it is feasibility problem with doing that. Can you imagine how hard it would be to round up 5 to 10 million illegals? Not to mention that no politician would never sign for that to happen. The economic costs would be incredible including the legal and transportation issues. This is the type of step that will stop an entire project dead in its tracks. I can just imagine the hispanic marches going on in Washington and riots breaking out throughout the country. Legal hispanics are not small in population here and they may not appreciate that there are so many illegals, but I don't expect that they would be too happy to see this type of thing put into action.\n \n We have to be realistic on what we can do at this point. It is our own fault for letting it get this far and it will go grow if we don't do something about it. It isn't reasonable to try and kick out every illegal we have here today. I think the best option is to simply legalize them and stop anymore from coming in. However, we cannot do one and not the other else it just won't work. What is happening in California right now is essentially legalization of almost 2 million illegals and of course that will only make it more attractive for others to cross the border into California. It just won't work without both of the steps being taken.",

I don't think you can draw a distinct line between the two because they are going to be so similar. And lets not forget how corrupt the Mexican government is. Those that got here legally probably didn't do it without being corrupt in some manor. Mexico is not like America. The poor and politically unconnected will not be nearly as likely to get into the US legally through the Mexico system. That means the ones who need to be here the most, the poor people, are the ones who can't get here by any other means than to jump the border.\n \n I don't want to get into the same mode that we are in the constitution debate. Coud you focus on the issue of feasibly sending back 5-10 million illegals if you strongly believe in your 3rd statement? If you want to have some sort of lottery or test to be done by these people to determine if they can stay here or not and the rest leave, how will you do this and how many will stay?\n \n Your 4th statement is true. However, if you have a huge, huge house and over the last 200 years have allowed several families to just show up there and live their illegally while raising their own families and now they are in control of 3% of the house and only a handful of the other guests are willing to support kicking them out or stopping more from coming in, then your going to have to find a way to deal with that. In this house scenario you of course could get federal help and there really is no where for them to hide in the house. They can easily be found by a police raid if necessary. Think of doing this on a wider scale. It would be extremely costly and it would disrupt a lot of our society especially if there is rioting which I would guess there would be.",

He was a hispanic and he believed it was their right to cross the border and to become legal citizens.

   "I agree with letting as many in as we legally can. But they don't all have to from Mexico of course.\n \n When did I say irrational? That is rational to let in people legally as long as we can handle them.\n \n When did I say it was irrational to pick and choose? I never did. It is rational.\n \n Mexico does decide who gets into our country at least at this time. Their government wants more of their citizens in our country to improve their own economy. They support those who are trying to cross the border and since they are able to you have to admit that Mexico has some say in who gets into our country. This needs to change.\n \n I'm glad you agree it isn't feasible to move them all back. Now we need a solution. Your solution is unclear. You want to make it difficult for them to stay. What does that mean? Remember that you also posted that people born in this country are legal, so illegals will have people born here soon that will become legal. Do you care that this will happen or not? Are you looking to move all the illegals out over time or not? Are you looking to increase spending on getting the illegals out and going to crack down on businesses who hire them?\n \n 200 years of tradition. That is what your trying to stop. If a family of Mexican origin lives in the US today and has family in Mexico who wants to get here, then it makes it more likely that it will happen. The US has allowed this for so long that it will be seen as taking away a freedom to the Mexican community. I listened to a guy on the O'Reilly show on Friday that was a supporter of allowing the border to stay open to illegals and to make all illegals that cross into legal citizens. He was a hispanic and he believed it was their right to cross the border and to become legal citizens. I think you will find a lot of these flawed ideas in the minds of hispanics who have jumped the border or know people who have jumped the border. As flawed as it is, hispanics will raise hell about taking away this 'freedom' the US has allowed them to have for years.\n\n \n I agree with everything you have said in this post. I still disagree with blanket legalizatlion.",

   "Thankfully this IS America's land \n\n \n Based on what? Not international law, which dictates that what the invaders did to First Nations here is illegal, making the US, essentially, a \"rogue nation\".\n \n \"The United States, during the first ninety-odd years of its existence, entered into and ratified more than 370 separate treaties with the peoples indigenous to the area now known as the 48 contiguous states.23 There are a number of important dimensions to this, but two aspects will do for our purposes here. First, by customary international law and provision of the U.S. Constitution itself, each treaty ratification represented a formal recognition by the federal government that the other parties to the treaties-the native peoples involved-were fully sovereign nations in their own right.24 Second, the purpose of the treaties, from the U.S. point of view, was to serve as real estate documents through which the United States acquired legal title to specified portions of North America from the indigenous nations it was thereby acknowledging already owned it.\n \n From the viewpoint of the indigenous nations, of course, these treaties served other purposes: the securing of permanently guaranteed borders to what remained of their national territories, assurance of the continuation of their ongoing self-governance, trade and military alliances, and so forth. The treaty relationships were invariably reciprocal in nature: Indians ceded certain portions of their land to the United States, and the United States incurred certain obligations in exchange.25 Even at that, there were seldom any outright sales of land by Indian nations to the United States. Rather, the federal obligations incurred were usually couched in terms of perpetuity. The arrangements were set up by the Indians so that, as long as the United States honored its end of the bargains, it would have the right to occupy and use defined portions of Indian land. In this sense, the treaties more nearly resemble rental or leasing instruments than actual deeds. And what happens under Anglo-Saxon common law when a tenant violates the provisions of a rental agreement?\n \n The point here is that the United States has long since defaulted on its responsibilities under every single treaty obligation it ever incurred with regard to Indians. There is really no dispute about this. In fact, there is even a Supreme Court opinion, the 1903 Lonewolf case, in which the good \"Justices\" held that the United States enjoyed a \"right\" to disregard any treaty obligation to Indians it found inconvenient, but that the remaining treaty provisions continued to be binding upon the Indians. This was, the high court said, because the United States was the stronger of the nations involved and thus wielded \"plenary\" power-this simply means full power-over the affairs of the weaker indigenous nations. Therefore, the court felt itself free to unilaterally \"interpret\" each treaty as a bill of sale rather than a rental agreement.26 \n \n Stripped of its fancy legal language, the Supreme Court's position was (and remains) astonishingly crude. There is an old adage that \"possession is nine-tenths of the law.\" Well, in this case the court went a bit further, arguing that possession was all of the law. Further, the highest court in the land went on record boldly arguing that, where Indian property rights are concerned, might, and might alone, makes right. The United States held the power to simply take Indian land, they said, and therefore it had the \"right\" to do so. This is precisely what the nazis argued only thirty years later, and the United States had the unmitigated audacity to profess outrage and shock that Germany was so blatantly transgressing against elementary standards of international law and the most basic requirements of human decency.27 \n \n 23. The complete texts of 371 of these ratified treaties can be found in Charles J. Kappler, ed., American Indian Treaties, 1778-1883 (New York: Interland, 1973). The Lakota scholar Vine Deloria, Jr., has also collected the texts of several more ratified treaties which do not appear in Kappler, but which will be published in a forthcoming collection.\n \n 24. The constitutional provision comes at Article I, Section 10. Codification of customary international law in this connection is explained in Sir Ian Sinclair, The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (Manchester: Manchester University Press, [2nd ed.] 1984).\n \n 25. See generally, Vine Deloria, Jr., and Clifford E. Lytle, American Indians, American Justice (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1983).\n \n 26. Lonewolf v. Hitchcock, 187 U.S. 553 (1903). For analysis, see Ann Laquer Estin, \"Lonewolf v. Hitchcock: The Long Shadow,\" in Sandra L. Cawallader and Vine Deloria, Jr., eds., The Aggressions of Civilization: Federal Indian Policy Since the 1880s (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1984) pp. 215-45.\n \n 27. Probably the best exposition of the legal principles articulated by the U.S. as being violated by the nazis may be found in Bradley F. Smith, The Road to Nuremberg (New York: Basic Books, 1981). \n \n \nNot in modern day society. If you believe that you are correct why not try walking into the White House or any other house that isn't yours.

In other words, just because you can force someone out of their home with a gun does not mean you have a \"right\" to it. Also, if they return later, just because you can \"defend\" your newly-taken house doesn't mean you have a \"right\" to be there.

   "Seal off the border to new immigrants until we come up with a solution for the problem.\n \n :xbanghead\n\n \n I really, really hope that something like that is done soon if only as a temporary solution. It really worries me to see our border so weak when there are probably thousands of people working at this very moment trying to think of a way to hurt us. There are governments out there who have chemical and biological, if not nuclear, weapons who would be glad to see us suffer. They would have cheap and experienced help getting such things into the US as well. I'm sure that drug dealers who have experience crossing our borders with certain illegal packages would be willing to help some of these nations causes for a price. It is entirely possible to drive a WMD right into any US city once beyond the border. It is just as possible to store it until more arrive and strike several cities at once.\n \n I see our border issue and it reminds me of how stupid we felt after 9/11 for not having seen the problem before it hurt us. Now we have this problem staring us right in the face and we don't seem to notice. It makes me mad that we will go so far to protect ourselves from an overseas threat in Iraq or Afghanistan, but we won't protect ourselves from a threat that is right in our own backyard. If nothing is done about this issue before something happens, then we have no one to blame but ourselves.",

   "Not true. Unless you think Native people, Puerto-Ricans, Hawaiians, and many others aren't people.\n\n \n What are you talking about here? That the natives still own the land they were born on? Perhaps you think that the French still owned their land after the Germans occupied it. Could you make this argument? Could you argue that China doesn't own Tibet? I bet those people would love for you to talk to the Chinese leaders and tell them why they cannot possibly own Tibet. You have a pretty weak argument here that I don't think would hold up on many levels and could not win in an actual debate about who owns Hawaii.\n \n \nHow is that? Hardly any two people can agree on what \"rights\" are, and what \"rights\" people should have.\n\n \n People cannot always agree on rights, but being that America is a democracy it was founded with us being given rights based on the leader's and people's opinion on what those rights should be. They have also been changed over time by the leader's and the people based on rights they found necessary to have or those they found that were not helpful to have. So now we have 285 million people who essentially share the same rights unless they are criminals. Most of the people can agree on what rights they have and most of the people can agree that these are the rights we should have. If not, this is still a democracy and the people would have the ability to change these rights with the help of our leaders if it was actually beneficial to ourselves and our system.\n \n That is why I claim that my definition of rights is and should be what I am allowed to do. The rights I have been given are the same as what the rest of the Americans have and they have allowed our system to become the most influential and powerful in the entire world. If you were to change the definition of rights from what we are essentially told to do by society and our government to being whatever we thought we should be able to do, then you have anarchy. That is a system that is completely uncontrolled by government or society because everyone is just doing whatever they feel like doing. If they think they have a right to rig lottery drawing so they can win, whose to say they shouldn't have that right if rights are based on individual opinions instead of that of the society and government?\n \n \nIt is absurd for you to be sitting at your computer discussing who should or should not be \"let in\" from Mexico of all places, seeing as a huge portion of Mexico was invaded by the Americans. Mexican people have much more historical and practical \"right\" to be in \"New Mexico\", Texas and California than European-Americans do.\n\n \n They have a right to that land? Perhaps the British should be able to take back America as well then because they do have more of a right to be here than us, right? This was their land so they should have all the rights to it? You would never use this debate to claim that Hitler should have given the Jews the right to settle on land in Germany and all the other places he conquered because they were there first. Military might allows you to change almost anything. Land ownership, population, culture, laws, rights, and borders. Mexico lost the land and if you want to be technical, since when have you ever lost something and ever felt you had a right to have it again? If you lost your house would you claim that you should have more of a right to live there than anyone else?\n \n Also you can recall that we could have taken all of Mexico if we wished. We gave some back for them to have. So I could make the argument that since we were so nice to them we should have more of a right to that land than they do because they wouldn't have it if it were not for how kind we were to them after their defeat. That is your debate turned around. Now do you take this seriously or do you actually respect current borders more than you respect history?\n \n \nI think you should look into how those states came to be taken from Mexico, amongst other things, before you start thinking you can say who should and shouldn't be allowed there.\n\n \n I think you should start looking at how hypocritical you are being before stating that the US alone should give land rights to the people who were there before the US took the land though might. You could use this debate on almost any country anywhere at anytime. China is a good one. They took a lot of land from the Manchu's so shouldn't they have special rights there instead of being treated like second hand citizens? Almost no country in the world would be too tolerant of your idea because it really makes no logical sense. We didn't take some land so that we could keep illegal immigrants on it who will suck our economy dry and break our laws. We took it for our own gain, not their gain. That is the way the world works and even a liberal thinker such as yourself have to realize this is a fact even if you don't like it.",

(JCC) in its capacity as today's association of successor organisations claims situated in the accession area with regard to cultural property of Jewish parties having suffered loss.
