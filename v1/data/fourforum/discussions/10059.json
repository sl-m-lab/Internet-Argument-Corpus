   "I'm not confusing the two, but it's quite clear that a nation is a people with a government, not just the people alone.\n\n \n **\n Wrong. There are still plenty of places where nations exist simply because they are a polity, an aggregation of peoples with a shared culture. There need be no recognised or recognisable government. The \"First Nations\" of Canada were nations without the formalized government institutions that create states, including 'nation-states', and they still are, despite the fact that the nation-state, Canada, has been built over the top of them.\n \n Nation-states are, as I see it, single-culture ethnic aggregations with a formal government tied to a specified geography. Without such formal government, and such a geographic definition, such an ethnic aggregation is not a 'state', but still a 'nation'. The \"Quebecois pur laine\", the Kurds, and the Palestinians being cases in point. They are nations without a state of their own, even as the jews once were. And the 'gypsies', the 'Romany\", too. And the Quebecois 'pur laine'. The problems arise when nations demand their own states.\n \n As to a nation's right to exist and resist 'ethnic cleansing', i.e., genocide and extirpation, it is a human right, the right to live, extended to a number of similar lives. If nations have no right to exist, then individuals have no right to life. You can argue the latter, but if you accept the one, you must accept the other.\n \n Not so for 'states'. States are arbitrary abstractions, political artefacts, and non-living artefacts have no rights. States may be changed, geographically and economically, and philosophically,and still remain the same states. (See Germany, 1918--1945.) Or they may remain unchanged, geographically, economically and philosophically, but be considered 'different' simply because of a name change. I could be wrong, but I think \"Ceylon-Sri Lanka\" is an example.\n \n IAC, nations have a right to exist as nations, but nations do not have a \"right\" to be \"states\", and \"states\" do not have 'a right to exist'. That is, a nation does not automatically have a right to possess a geographic area, and arbitrarily impose their 'state' upon it. That right is a 'property right', not a 'human right', and is a legal right, not a moral right. As such, wrt to 'states', property law must prevail. One of the chief principles of property law is that property does not belong to whoever has the muscle to take it from another and keep the loser from getting it back. Civilization operates on different lines, although in many cases, you wouldn't know it.\n \n \n\n For example if I said \"Quebec should be its own nation\", or \"The people of Quebec have a right to nationhood\" it would be clear not that I was simply suggesting Quebec's people live in Quebec, but that they have an independent government.\n\n \n **\n It would be clear if any racist Quebecois 'pur laine' was the speaker. Not at all clear if anyone else said it. The \"people of Quebec\" are not, one and all, \"Quebecois pur laine\", i.e., mono-lingual french-speaking descendents of pre-20th century immigrants. In fact, the canadian province of Quebec was territorially limited to a few miles north and south of the St. Lawrence River until 1912. Any argument over the 'property rights' of the 'pur laine' nation wrt independent statehood must take that fact into consideration, along with the fact that the indigenous english-speaking indian and inuit nations that inhabit what was once \"Rupert's Land\" have a far better property claim to it than any \"pur laine\" separatiste in Quebec City. But forget all that; it's not the middle east.\n \n \n\n So far we have heard, there is an argument for the existence of Israel, and it is a bad argument, but you don't think Israel should disappear, and no matter if you do or don't agree you're a dumbass....\n\n \n **\n As to Israel, as a state it has no 'right to exist', nor ever did. The jews as a nation always had a right to exist, but never a right to their own geographically circumscribed state. No claim under property law that says \"This property was mine 2,000 years ago [no paper title or other historical testimony submitted in evidence apart from an antiques collection of self-serving ethnic writing], and so it is mine, and not the property of those peoples who have inhabited it since time immemorial, including the time prior to my ethnicity's first invasion, when we took it by violence and murder and ethnic cleansing for the first time, some 3000 years ago.\n \n Add to that the fact that Israel is politically a zionist, mono-ethnic racist state that persecutes the conquered indigenous folk that owned the land before the eastern european zionist-jews invaded, and that their treatment of these peoples maps perfectly to the heinous behaviour of Nazis wrt the people's they conquered, I would go so far as to say that, just as we did contra Hitler, the Palestinians and their allies have a perfect right to destroy Israel. \n \n But not the jewish nation. No more than we had a 'right' to destroy the German and the Japanese 'nations', that is, to kill the people. Nation massacre, i.e., 'ethnic cleansing', is for the likes of nazis and zionists and pre-20th century colonialists.",

Only around 20% of Israel was actually annexed (taken from someone who owned the home). There are over 2 Million Jews living Iran as we speak. So many of the families in Israel have clear ties to the land they now hold.\n\n \n **\n Up to now you had shown some real knowledge of the history of Palestine, [as opposed to the xtianish and jewish garbage of people like peteratwar],but what you say here is highly questionable.\n \n Between the first century and the 20th century only a very small minority of the palestinian population was hebrew. There are population data in turkish archives. Most certainly jews never owned or in any way had legal title to anything remotely approaching 80% of palestinian territory.\n \n From the Balfour Declaration on, eastern european zionists began to deliberately wrench the land out from under its aboriginal muslim and christian residents. It was, as I say, a deliberate move to dispossess one resident people and replace it with another, foreign, ethnicity. Anyone who knows the first thing about zionism knows that.\n \n At first, since Palestine under the turks was feudal, FAPP, the land was agrarian, tilled by palestinian peasants for absentee landlords. Zionists used money to buy the land, and then to drive off the peasants that had lived on it for thousands of years. Much as was done in the \"Highland Clearances\" of british ill-fame. The difference being, of course, that the indigenous peasants were then replaced by jews, most of them with no farm experience. Look it up. \n \n Now some say that if you buy land, it's yours to do with as you like. For instance, if the chinese government should buy Hawaiian real estate, thousands and thousands of acres of it, then they would have the 'property right' to evict all non-chinese on their 'private property', and replace them with settlers from China. This is what the jews did to the palestinians.\n \n Buying land is one thing, but when you buy land, evict your tenants that come with, and declare, as the jews did and still do, that this land is now 'jewish' and can never be sold to a non-jew, nor may any but a jew live upon it, then you, as a political unit, have not bought land,-- you have annexed territory. In effect, you have expropriated it.\n \n Between 1919 and 1947 jews used every sort of terrorism to drive palestinians both from homes that they owned privately, and from homes that were theirs by right of living in them for generations, as peasants-- no matter the 'deed' held in Cairo or Istanbul, or wherever. They continue this vicious, evil, monstrous practice to this very day.\n \n See below, this excerpted citation--\n \n \"Conflict between Palestinians and Israelis stems from the conflicting claims of the two groups to the same territory. In light of post-WWII tensions in British controlled Palestine, the newborn United Nations passed Resolution 181 in 1947: a partition plan to divide the territory between Palestinian Arabs and Jewish immigrants. Palestinians resisted the partition plan, which assigned the smaller Jewish population a larger territory. This partition would eventually lead to the dispossession of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, an event is known as Al-Nakba or \"the catastrophe.\" Palestinians argued that neither Roman era Jewish history nor the recent Nazi genocide against the Jews voided their rights as legal residents and landowners in Palestine. \n \n During this time, Jewish terror groups intensified their attacks on Palestinian civilians and began driving them from their homes and villages. In 1948, Zionist leaders declared the new state of Israel and aggressively seized the offensive in guerrilla warfare against the Palestinians. Subsequent Israeli attacks on Palestinian towns and villages during this first Arab-Israeli War of 1948-49 served to expand the territory under Jewish control and drastically reduce the Palestinian population in its interior. \n \n For example: \n \n \n Israeli forces committed at least 34 atrocities (i) , including the massacre at Deir Yasin, which killed 254 men, women, and children. (ii) \n 750,000 Palestinians were expelled from their homes between 1947 and 1949. In addition, 13,000 Palestinians were killed, 418 Palestinian villages were completely depopulated, and half of all villages in Palestine were physically destroyed. (iii) \n By 1949, only 150,000 of the pre-1947 Palestinian population remained in Israel. (iv) Two thirds of the refugees who fled Israel went to the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The remaining third scattered throughout Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and other parts of the world. (v) \n In 1967 Palestinians were once again forced to flee war as victorious Israeli forces occupied portions of Palestinian territory that were captured by Jordanian and Egyptian forces in the 1948 war. The 1967 War impacted refugees living within areas attacked and/or annexed by Israel: the West Bank, Gaza, East Jerusalem, the Golan Heights, and the Sinai Peninsula. \n \n Since the so-called \"Six Day War,\" Israel's actions in the occupied territories have maximized territorial gains while reducing the numbers of, or altogether displacing, Palestinian residents via annexations and an ongoing settlement policy that violates both UN Security Council resolutions and the Geneva Convention. \n \n \n In 1967, 325,000 Palestinians, many of them refugees originally displaced in 1948, sought refuge in neighboring Arab states. (vi) \n During the next decade, an average of 21,000 Palestinians per year was forced out of Israeli-controlled areas. (vii) \n The pattern of Palestinian flight continued during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. \n \n During the 1982 Israeli siege of Beirut, about 2000 Palestinian civilians in Sabra and Shatilla Refugee Camps were massacred by right wing Lebanese militias in areas controlled by Israeli forces under the command of Ariel Sharon, who was Minister of Defense at the time. In response to the massacre and under pressure from its own peace movement, the Israeli government set up the Kahan Commission to investigate. The commission reported that, \"Mr. Sharon was found responsible for ignoring the danger of bloodshed and revenge when he approved the entry of the Phalangists [right-wing militias] into the camps as well as not taking appropriate measures to prevent bloodshed.\" \n 312,000 Palestinians were working and living in Kuwait in 1990, but as a result of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1991, the vast majority of those refugees were displaced and are still without secure residency. Only 30,000 Palestinians were living in Kuwait in 2000. (ix) \n Since the Israeli occupation began in 1967, Palestinians have been subject to brutal repression and Israeli government attempts to resolve the \"refugee issue\" by expelling refugees not in camps. Displays of Palestinian nationalism are often met with collective punishments, including the closure of communities, measures preventing Palestinians from holding steady employment, curfews (which sometimes place whole refugee camps under house arrest for months at a time), and the denial of basic utilities such as electricity and water service. \n \n \n Since 1987, the Israeli government has destroyed over 2,650 homes in the West Bank for not obtaining building permits. Thousands of acres owned by Palestinians have been confiscated to construct Israeli settlements. (x) \n In the 1970s and 1980s, Israeli policy in the Occupied Territories was designed to suppress political activity and isolate the population from Palestinian organizations and activists abroad. Despite systematic Israeli repression, the occupied population nevertheless established themselves as leaders of the Palestinian struggle for national liberation when, in 1987, they launched the first Palestinian Intifada (\"shaking-off\" in Arabic), which lasted until 1991. \n \n INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION OF PALESTINIAN REFUGEE RIGHTS\n \n During the past 50 years, the international community has repeatedly called for a resolution to the refugee problem. The most important and explicit support for the rights of Palestinian refugees is UN resolution 194 signed in 1948. Resolution 194 was adopted only six months before Israel's admission as a member of the United Nations (GA Resolution 273, 11 May 1949). Israel's admission was conditioned by an Israeli commitment to carry out the obligations under the UN charter and United Nation resolutions, including Resolution 194. (xi) \n \n According to Paragraph 11 of the resolution, recognition of the refugees' right of return to their homes is stated as follows: \"Refugees who wish to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbors should be permitted to do so at the earliest practical date, and that compensation should be paid for the property of those choosing not to return and for loss of or damage to, property which under principles of international law or in equity, should be made good by the governments or authorities responsible.\" \n \n Since 1949, Resolution 194 has been reaffirmed more than 110 times by the General Assembly. (xii) \n \n A general support for the concept of refugee rights is found in the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 13: \"Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country.\" (xiii) \"\n \n **\n See-- http://www.globalexchange.org/countries/mideast/palestine/refugeeFacts.html",

   "**\n \n FYI--\n \n \"United Press International\u00ae\n News. Analysis. Insight.\u0099 \n International Security - Emerging Threats - Analysis \n \n \n Published: Aug. 6, 2007 at 11:17 AM\n Commentary: Embarrassing history\n By ARNAUD DE BORCHGRAVE\n UPI Editor at Large\n WASHINGTON, Aug. 6 (UPI) -- The Palestinians call Israel's 1948 war of independence their nakba, or catastrophic ethnic cleansing, or forced exile. The Israelis, for their part, have steadfastly rejected any suggestion of ethnic cleansing as calumny in all its anti-Semitic horror. \n \n Historic revisionism is now under way. Without fanfare, just below the media radar screen, the Israeli Education Ministry has approved a textbook for Arab third-graders in Israel that concedes the war that gave birth to Israel was a \"nakba\" for the Palestinians. The textbook refers to the \"expulsion\" of some of the Palestinians and the \"confiscation of many Arab-owned lands.\" \n \n Textbooks for Jewish Israelis in the same grade make no such verbal concession. But Israel's \"new wave\" historians have been combing through fresh material now available from the British mandate period and Israeli archives that document the history of Israel before and after it became a state. Long-lasting myths are being debunked. \n \n Ilan Pappe, an Israeli historian and Haifa University lecturer, whose ninth book is titled \"The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine,\" documents how Israel was born with lands forcibly seized from its Palestinian inhabitants who had lived there for hundreds of years. \n \n During the British mandate (1920-1948), Zionist leaders concluded Palestinians, who owned 90 percent of the land (with 5.8 percent owned by Jews), would have to be forcibly expelled to make a Jewish state possible. Pappe quotes David Ben-Gurion, Israel's first prime minister, addressing the Jewish Agency Executive in June 1938, as saying, \"I am for compulsory transfer. I do not see anything immoral in it.\" \n \n Pappe outlines Plan D (Dalet in Hebrew), which followed earlier plans A, B and C, and included forcible expulsion of some 800,000 Palestinians from both urban and rural areas with the objective of creating by any means necessary an exclusive Jewish state without an Arab presence. The methods ranged from a campaign of disinformation -- \"get out immediately because the Jews are on their way to kill you\" -- to Jewish militia attacks to terrorize the Palestinians. \n \n The first Jewish militia attacks, says Pappe, began before the May 1948 end of the British mandate. In December 1947 two villages in the central plain -- Deir Ayyub and Beit Affa -- were raided, and their panicked Palestinian inhabitants fled. Jewish leaders gave the order to drive out as many Palestinians as possible on March 10, 1948. The terror campaign ended six months later. Pappe writes 531 Palestinian villages were destroyed, and 11 urban neighborhoods in cities were emptied of their Palestinian inhabitants. \n \n There is no doubt in Pappe's mind that Plan D \"was a clear-cut case of an ethnic cleansing operation, regarded under international law today as a crime against humanity.\" \n \n Plan Dalet began in the rural hills on the western slopes of the Jerusalem mountains halfway on the road to Tel Aviv, according to Pappe. It was called Operation Nachshon, and served as a model for massive expulsions using terror tactics. Pappe also details what he calls the \"urbicide of Palestine\" that included attacking and cleansing the major urban centers of Tiberias, Haifa, Tel Aviv, Safad and what he calls the \"Phantom City of Jerusalem\" once Jewish troops shelled, attacked and occupied its western Arab neighborhoods in April 1948. The British did not interfere. \n \n Lobbied by the World Zionist Organization and its guiding spirit Chaim Weizmann, who became the first president of Israel (1949-52), the British decided in favor of a Jewish state in Palestine in the 1917 Balfour Declaration. This was a letter from the British Foreign Secretary to Lord Rothschild (Walter, 2nd Baron Rothschild), the leader of the British Jewish community, for relay to the Zionist Federation. The British also pledged indigenous Arab rights would be protected as they divvied up the Ottoman Empire. \n \n The myth was then created of \"a land without people for a people without a land\" even though the \"empty land\" had a flourishing Palestinian Arab population. The U.N. partition plan of Nov. 29, 1947, gave the Jews 56 percent of Palestine, with one-third of the population, while making Jerusalem an international city. The Jewish part included the most fertile land and almost all urban areas. \n \n When the British handed power to the Jews on May 15, 1948, including the influx of survivors from Hitler's concentration camps, two-thirds of the population was still Palestinian. \n \n The first Arab-Israeli war quickly followed as the armies of Egypt, Transjordan (now Jordan), Syria, Lebanon and Iraq joined Palestinian and other Arab guerrillas who had been attacking Jewish forces since November 1947. The Arabs failed to prevent the establishment of a Jewish state and were defeated. The war ended with four U.N.-arranged armistice agreements between Israel and Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria. \n \n Commenting on Pappe's historical research, Rami Khouri, director of the Issam Fares Institute at the American University of Beirut and editor at large of the Beirut Daily Star, writes, \"Many Israelis will challenge Pappe's account. Such a process should ideally spark an honest, comprehensive analysis that could lead us to an accurate narrative of what happened in 1947-48 -- accurate for both sides, if it is to have meaning for either side.\" \n \n An Israeli official textbook for Palestinian third-graders, says Fares, \"that fleetingly acknowledges the Palestinian trauma of exile and occupation in 1948 is an intriguing sign of something that remains largely unclear.\" The \"something\" is worth exploring and reciprocating, \"if it indicates a capacity to move toward the elusive shared, accurate, truthful account of Israeli and Palestinian history that must anchor any progress toward a negotiated peace.\" \n \n The consensus in Israel today, says Pappe, is for a state comprising 90 percent of Palestine \"surrounded by electric fences and visible and invisible walls\" with Palestinians given only worthless cantonized scrub lands of little value to the Jewish state.

   "**\n \n FYI--\n \n \"United Press International\u00ae\n News. Analysis. Insight.\u0099 \n International Security - Emerging Threats - Analysis \n \n \n Published: Aug. 6, 2007 at 11:17 AM\n Commentary: Embarrassing history\n By ARNAUD DE BORCHGRAVE\n UPI Editor at Large\n WASHINGTON, Aug. 6 (UPI) -- The Palestinians call Israel's 1948 war of independence their nakba, or catastrophic ethnic cleansing, or forced exile. The Israelis, for their part, have steadfastly rejected any suggestion of ethnic cleansing as calumny in all its anti-Semitic horror. \n \n Historic revisionism is now under way. Without fanfare, just below the media radar screen, the Israeli Education Ministry has approved a textbook for Arab third-graders in Israel that concedes the war that gave birth to Israel was a \"nakba\" for the Palestinians. The textbook refers to the \"expulsion\" of some of the Palestinians and the \"confiscation of many Arab-owned lands.\" \n \n Textbooks for Jewish Israelis in the same grade make no such verbal concession. But Israel's \"new wave\" historians have been combing through fresh material now available from the British mandate period and Israeli archives that document the history of Israel before and after it became a state. Long-lasting myths are being debunked. \n \n Ilan Pappe, an Israeli historian and Haifa University lecturer, whose ninth book is titled \"The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine,\" documents how Israel was born with lands forcibly seized from its Palestinian inhabitants who had lived there for hundreds of years. \n \n During the British mandate (1920-1948), Zionist leaders concluded Palestinians, who owned 90 percent of the land (with 5.8 percent owned by Jews), would have to be forcibly expelled to make a Jewish state possible. Pappe quotes David Ben-Gurion, Israel's first prime minister, addressing the Jewish Agency Executive in June 1938, as saying, \"I am for compulsory transfer. I do not see anything immoral in it.\" \n \n Pappe outlines Plan D (Dalet in Hebrew), which followed earlier plans A, B and C, and included forcible expulsion of some 800,000 Palestinians from both urban and rural areas with the objective of creating by any means necessary an exclusive Jewish state without an Arab presence. The methods ranged from a campaign of disinformation -- \"get out immediately because the Jews are on their way to kill you\" -- to Jewish militia attacks to terrorize the Palestinians. \n \n The first Jewish militia attacks, says Pappe, began before the May 1948 end of the British mandate. In December 1947 two villages in the central plain -- Deir Ayyub and Beit Affa -- were raided, and their panicked Palestinian inhabitants fled. Jewish leaders gave the order to drive out as many Palestinians as possible on March 10, 1948. The terror campaign ended six months later. Pappe writes 531 Palestinian villages were destroyed, and 11 urban neighborhoods in cities were emptied of their Palestinian inhabitants. \n \n There is no doubt in Pappe's mind that Plan D \"was a clear-cut case of an ethnic cleansing operation, regarded under international law today as a crime against humanity.\" \n \n Plan Dalet began in the rural hills on the western slopes of the Jerusalem mountains halfway on the road to Tel Aviv, according to Pappe. It was called Operation Nachshon, and served as a model for massive expulsions using terror tactics. Pappe also details what he calls the \"urbicide of Palestine\" that included attacking and cleansing the major urban centers of Tiberias, Haifa, Tel Aviv, Safad and what he calls the \"Phantom City of Jerusalem\" once Jewish troops shelled, attacked and occupied its western Arab neighborhoods in April 1948. The British did not interfere. \n \n Lobbied by the World Zionist Organization and its guiding spirit Chaim Weizmann, who became the first president of Israel (1949-52), the British decided in favor of a Jewish state in Palestine in the 1917 Balfour Declaration. This was a letter from the British Foreign Secretary to Lord Rothschild (Walter, 2nd Baron Rothschild), the leader of the British Jewish community, for relay to the Zionist Federation. The British also pledged indigenous Arab rights would be protected as they divvied up the Ottoman Empire. \n \n The myth was then created of \"a land without people for a people without a land\" even though the \"empty land\" had a flourishing Palestinian Arab population. The U.N. partition plan of Nov. 29, 1947, gave the Jews 56 percent of Palestine, with one-third of the population, while making Jerusalem an international city. The Jewish part included the most fertile land and almost all urban areas. \n \n When the British handed power to the Jews on May 15, 1948, including the influx of survivors from Hitler's concentration camps, two-thirds of the population was still Palestinian. \n \n The first Arab-Israeli war quickly followed as the armies of Egypt, Transjordan (now Jordan), Syria, Lebanon and Iraq joined Palestinian and other Arab guerrillas who had been attacking Jewish forces since November 1947. The Arabs failed to prevent the establishment of a Jewish state and were defeated. The war ended with four U.N.-arranged armistice agreements between Israel and Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria. \n \n Commenting on Pappe's historical research, Rami Khouri, director of the Issam Fares Institute at the American University of Beirut and editor at large of the Beirut Daily Star, writes, \"Many Israelis will challenge Pappe's account. Such a process should ideally spark an honest, comprehensive analysis that could lead us to an accurate narrative of what happened in 1947-48 -- accurate for both sides, if it is to have meaning for either side.\" \n \n An Israeli official textbook for Palestinian third-graders, says Fares, \"that fleetingly acknowledges the Palestinian trauma of exile and occupation in 1948 is an intriguing sign of something that remains largely unclear.\" The \"something\" is worth exploring and reciprocating, \"if it indicates a capacity to move toward the elusive shared, accurate, truthful account of Israeli and Palestinian history that must anchor any progress toward a negotiated peace.\" \n \n The consensus in Israel today, says Pappe, is for a state comprising 90 percent of Palestine \"surrounded by electric fences and visible and invisible walls\" with Palestinians given only worthless cantonized scrub lands of little value to the Jewish state. In 2006, Pappe sees that 1.4 million Palestinians live in Israel on 2 percent of the land allotted to them plus another 1 percent for agricultural use with 6 million Jews on most of the rest. \"Another 3.9 million live concentrated in Israel's unwanted portions of the West Bank and concentrated in Gaza that has three times the population density of Manhattan,\" notes Pappe. Back from the Middle East last week, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said prospects are good for a two-state solution.
