Here is an interesting discrussion that talks about the fetus and pain, and also about pain itself...\n http://eileen.undonet.com/Main/fetlpain/PainDiscus.htm\n\n \n There is obviously much more disagreement and uncertainty than what you suggest. Artilces from the pro-choice website, you quote say foe example: \n \n (From the quoted article itself) \"A Department of Health spokesperson reportedly told the Catholic Herald that the Government was aware of considerable diversity of opinion within society and the medical profession.\"\n \n (Other articles on the site) \"The evaluation of pain in the human fetus and neonate is difficult because pain is generally defined as a subjective phenomenon.\"\n \n \"Invasive diagnostic and therapeutic techniques are increasingly applied to the etus. It is not known if the fetus feels pain during such procedures, but the fetus does mount significant stress hormonal and circulatory changes in response to these from 18-20 weeks.\"\n \n Here are some conclusions from various medical journals and books I looked up:\n \n \"By 13 1/2 to 14 weeks, the entire body surface, except for the back and the top of the head, are sensitive to pain.\" S. Reinis & J. Goldman, The Development of the Brain C. Thomas Pub., 1980.\n \n \"While a cortical processing of pain theoretically becomes possible after development of the thalamo-cortical connections in the 26th week of gestation, noxious stimuli may trigger complex reflex reactions much earlier. However, more important than possible painfulness is the fact that the noxious stimuli, by triggering stress responses, most likely affect the development of an individual at very early stages.\" Vanhatalo S, van Nieuwenhuizen O. Brain Dev. 2000 May;22(3):145-50. \n \n \"As to the question of fetal pain, one can never know whether fetuses feel pain, because they can never tell.\" Goodman NW. \"Changing tactics in the abortion argument: does a fetus feel pain?\" Br J Hosp Med. 1997 Dec 10;58(11):550. \n \n \"There has been debate recently as to whether the fetus can feel pain, a subject not readily amenable to research--not only are ethical issues involved, but the evaluation of pain felt by the fetus is also problematic, as it is unable to communicate intelligibly. A philosophical problem also arise concerning the definition of pain, as it is a phenomenon complicated by the presence of both emotional and experiential components. Moreover, there is the question of which anatomical structures are necessary for pain perception.... Nervous system function in infants differs from that in adults, reflexes being more easily triggered in infants, for example, and thus it is difficult to distinguish pain response from reflexes.\" Amerioun E, Westgren M. \"Insufficient knowledge about pain in the unborn child.\" Lakartidningen [Article in Swedish]. 1998 Jun 17;95(25):2959-61. \n \n \"Do fetuses feel pain? We don't know; better to err on the safe side from mid-gestation.\" Glover V, Fisk N. BMJ. 1996 Sep 28;313(7060):796. \n \n \"Can fetuses feel pain? Pain perception in fetuses and newborn infants is not measurable--nonetheless operate only with anesthesia.\" Bethcke B. Fortschr Med. 1987 Dec 10;105(35):78-9.[Article in German]\n \n \"The Telegraph has investigated this contentious issue... by approaching 100 neuroscientists for their views...80 per cent of those who did respond agreed that pain relief should be given to the foetus during abortions conducted between 11 and 24 weeks.\" Telegraph (UK) 12/10/2000.\n \n \"By thirteen and a half weeks, organic response to noxious stimuli occurs at all levels of the nervous system, from the pain receptors to the thalamus.\" V. J. Collins, Principles of Anesthesiology, 1976.\n \n As many of these researchers are saying, we must be somewhat agnostic on this issue since measuring pain is extremely difficult. Very tentatively, it looks like an important source of the disagreement is what the definition of pain is. If we mean psychological pain, this appears later in fetal development. If we mean \"physical\" pain--stress responses to noxious stimuli like increased heartbeat or reflexive, reactive movement--this appears during the time when many abortions occur.",

According to the Guttmacher website I just looked at, there were 1.3 million abortions in 2000 (the most recent year they had listed). 1.5% of those abortions were of fetuses 21 weeks or older. So the contention that experiencing pain when aborted is typical is probably mistaken. They do not break down these late term abortions further, but following the wide ranges of estimates I gave in the earlier post, one can argue that fetuses aborted at 21 weeks or later are likely to feel it. Well 1.5% of 1.3 million is 19,500 abortions where fetuses did feel the pain as they were killed. That is more than the 17,182 homicides in the U.S. in 2001 (latest figure by CDC).",
