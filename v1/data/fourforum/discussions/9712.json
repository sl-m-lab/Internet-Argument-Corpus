It is obvious they were doing so--they planned the turnout beforehand and wore rainbow attire at the event. This year, the group called Family Pride basically tried to do the same thing having gay families sign up on their website to come. This was a contrived, planned, turnout by a gay activism organization. So their strategy was obviously to use the event for their cause, by attracting attention by making the news over this, and by visibly standing out at the event (e.g. rainbow attire). I'm not saying their cause isn't just. I'm just saying that they are using the egg roll for an activist purpose, and they are. It's that simple. There's no way around that. I have no problem with gay families going to the egg roll. But they aren't just attending the egg roll--they could have done that anyway, without signing up for it on the gay rights org website. They're going to stand out in the crowd and they are using the event for ulterior purposes. Surely you can see that. So that's the strategy.\n \n what they hoped to accomplish ...\n \n Attracting attention to their point that gays have families. What else would it be?\n \n why you think it was misguided ...\n \n Because it has done little good, if any. In fact, almost everyone I know of viewed it as a stunt, and so with some it obviously had the opposite effect by turning people off. Tell me, what good do you think really came of it? Specifically? Gay groups got in the news. That's really about it. (and this year even THAT didn't really happen to any significant degree.) Everyone knows gays have families. Everyone knows gays exist. Everyone knows that many gays have children. It's not like using this event as a means to an end is going to make people slap their forehead and say \"doh! I had no idea gays exist, have families, and that many have children!\" People realize that already. (You see? I am fully understanding of what gay rights groups were trying to get across here. Disagreement does not equal misunderstanding.) Now you need to realize that I would feel the same way about a religious group coming in and trying to use this children's event to further their cause/agenda. That would be just as much of a turn-off to me. The ideology is not the issue; the issue is that of using something like this for ulterior motives. You may have no problem with that, and you're entitled to your opinion. But I'm also entitled to mine and I think the whole thing was pretty silly.",

And this year the anti-gay crowd didn't either, which is an improvement from last year. I think the gays were quite clever. They managed to score some political mileage without causing the least bit of disruption, they did nothing to spoil the event for the kids. You are right though, I don't get why you're upset over this when nothing actually happened at the event. To me this is as much of a protest as wearing one of those yellow bracelets that people have now. Which is to say, not a protest at all.\n \n \n\n Maybe you're right that I have no idea regarding that, but I suspect a lot more people know this than you realize. And when it comes to the legal goals of the gay pride movement, it's pretty much beside the point anyway.\n\n If it's besides the point, why are you even bringing it up? emoticon_confused \n \n \n\n Absolutely, which is why I took issue with the gay pride protesters in this case. Turning a children's event into a protest opportunity on a hot-button issue is a very Phelpsian thing to do. :)\n\n A gay wearing a lei equates to a Christian protesting at a funeral and saying that someones dead child is going to hell to you?

I would point folks to the Family Pride Coalition website: http://www.familypride.org/eggroll/ \n \n The Family Pride Coalition organized the gay participation in the egg roll event, last year and this year. You can see a brief interview with Jennifer Chrisler, the executive director of the Family Pride Coalition, if you click on the video link to the right, which has a tv news story about the egg roll. Jennifer argues that this was not a protest, that it's just gay families taking an opportunity to be visible. \n \n Apparently there were other groups doing a bomb protest with children at the same time, and they drew a lot of fire from people who felt that their protest was inappropriate.\n \n Anyhow, I think it's always good for gay families to be visible and to organize events like this. Just the one-on-one contact between our families and other families helps to bridge gaps and to build positive relations. Our families have been invisible for too long. Plus I think the egg roll would be fun for kids from all kinds of families. \n \n I have some knowledge of the Family Pride Coalition. Our family has gone to Family Week in Provincetown for the last 3 years. This is a week organized by FPC. I think they are a terrific group. Family Week is great fun.",

   "Steeeeve,\n \n I don't see why gay families getting together to take their children to the egg roll and being visible to others is \"wrong.\" What's wrong about that? The children have a good time, and families of different sexual orientations get to interact with each other. It seems like a win for everyone. No one is harmed, and people have fun and meet each other. \n \n And if the gay families are not protesting anything and are simply participating openly and visibly, how is it a \"protest?\" Especially if the organizer of the gay family event says that it's not a protest. It seems to be more of a meet and greet than a protest. I think that our families being visible and meeting others is an essential part of our changing attitudes and making life better for our families. We meet people and get to know them, and we become friends. How is doing that \"wrong?\"\n \n It strikes me that the people who organized a children's \"bomb hunt\" at the same time did organize a protest.....against bombs. That was a protest, and one that drew much criticism for having children hunt for \"bombs.\"",

That would be a lot more convincing to me. I think it is wrong to use your kid to try and prove something to others.\n\n \n The Million Man March was more than a bunch of people walking, but it wasn't exactly a protest either. It was a statement, which is not necessarily a protest. In part it was a statement of commitment by African American men to their families and communities. \n \n Being visible is only a protest if people are protesting something. In the case of the egg roll, it was simply a statement that, \"We are here.\" \n \n Gay parents always pay attention to our own children. The point of participation in the egg roll was not to convince other families that gay families are \"good.\" It was to be visible to other families and to get to know other families. I think the more we interact with other families and give our children the opportunity to interact with others, the better for our children. \n \n I am an adoptive parent, and my child is from Guatemala. I belong to a group of families with children from Guatemala. We go to events together all the time, and we identify ourselves as families with children from Guatemala. Is that a protest? No. Are we being visible? Yes. We want people to know that there are families with children from Guatemala, and we want to interact with other families and also to enable our children to have a good time. Are we using our children \"to prove something to others?\" I don't think so. We are interacting with others. It's similar to what the gay families did at the egg roll.",
