He can pay the $500,000, but not a penny more. But, he'll let the american taxpayer pay the other $4 million thats owed on the original loan. So, us kind hearted taxpayers paid $4million for Jeb so that he may keep this piece of property.\n First we are forced to pay the $4 million of the original loan, and secondly, when Jeb, the brilliant one, sells that piece of property for over $8 miilion, he gets to keep every single penny of the profits. He doesn't have to pay a penny of the $4 million back to the taxpayers. \n \n Hell, imagine if any of us tried to pull something like that off?\n \n \n Thats just 1 of quite a few reasons why Jeb wont make it to the Whitehouse.",

I also agree that MTBE is one of the biggest screw ups of the environmental lobby.\n \n You're certainly a jaded fellow. :p \n \n It was a gov't job LOL, she was paid by the hour. She would do all she could pass people's tanks, she wasn't in the business of shutting people down, but if your tanks leak, your tanks leak, that's just the way it is. She didn't have anything to gain personally from it. In fact, that's a rather assinine assumption on your part. \n \n I don't recall the exact timeframe that station owners were given to replace the tanks, but IIRC, it was actually a substantial time period, somewhere in the neighborhood of 6 months to 1 year.\n \n Unfortunately, when they were \"informed\" (most knew damn well their tanks leaked) many people simply walked away from the station and the cost of clean up, leaving the gov't with the tab. There are still hundreds, if not thousands, of sites out there that will likely never be cleaned up, or at the least, will be waiting a long time to be cleaned up.\n \n \nWhy is it that a \"staunch environmentalist\" tosses his passion right out the window when it comes to safety??

WHY NOT? \n \n \n Why is it that thousands of other environmentalists don't in the case of road salt?\n \n At any rate, safety is very important.\n \n \"Private property rights\", what about my right to drink clean water? Breathe clean air? \n \n Again, who's rights are more important?\n \n Private property rights are great, but they are not a license to do as you please regardless of the consequences your actions may have for others.\n \n \nWell, they're both by economists, too bad you missed them.

However, I understand it, and I even tend to agree with it to a certain extent. Unfortunately, it only takes a handful of XXXXXX to destroy an area that thousands of people use and enjoy without causing any damage.\n \n \nThe regulations caused the boom? Or the boom happened in spite of the regulations?\n\n \n The regulation caused the boom, plain and simple, by forcing the manufacturers to develop the 4 stroke. The inflow of cash and advanced technology into motorcycling created far better bikes and a whole new market for them. IMHO, no EPA, we'd all still be riding the same 2 stroke MX'ers that they've been building largely unchanged since the mid 80's.\n \n \nAccording to whom? An environmentalist who is paid to make that decision? If most cars are not spewing out high emissions, why should they have to pay so the government can make sure? \n \n \n Most people aren't criminals, why should I have to pay for a police force?\n \n Do you have insurance? Been in an accident?\n \n Do you pay school taxes?

   "Now to the real issue.\n \n In fact oil and gas does mix to a very small degree in water, and of course can and does contaminate ground water and other drinking water sources. If I am not mistake less then 10 mg/L of oil or gas contamination in water makes it unpalatable for human consumption.\n \n A heavily poluting car is not a problem, 1 million heavily poluting autos is. Monitoring auto emmisions in Montana doesnt make economic sense. Monitoring auto emmisions in LA, Vancouver or Toronto ( currently suffering from an inversion trapping air polutants within the city)\n \n Alberta is not overly excessive when it comes to environmental cleanup or industry. Sediment from oil and gas batteries ( Oil well collection sites designed to remove sediments and water from oil) is used on rural roads to keep dust down as long as certain conditions are met ( heavy metal contamination). Industrial sites that are contaminated but present no risk are not cleaned up. If the contamination is spreading or presents a risk to human life it is cleaned up. \n \n Two examples \n 1. Creosote (sp) used to treat rail road wood ties. In downtown Calgary along the Bow river, there used to be in the early 1900's a plant used to treat railroad ties with Creosote. Of course many many litres leaked and contaminated the area. In the early 1990's the Creosote started to leak into the river and into area basements. It was cleaned up and I believe still has a small monitoring station that is pumping up the remaining creosote.\n 2. An oil refinery that closed down in the 50's was not cleaned up at that time. Now many homeowners have been directly and negatively affected by the high lead ( I lbelieve) contamination in their neighborhood. Imperial OIl ( Esso) is having to remove the top 1 meter of open surface top soil for almost the entire area.",

   "The ratio is irrelevent. It's a simple function of how toxic the pollutant is. \n\n \n Pollutants are almost always more toxic in greater quantities. Today's technology can find microscopic amounts of deadly substances in just about everything we eat and drink. But the amounts are small enough not to matter. If one drinks enough ocean salt water, they'll die. Ratio is very relevent. \n \n \nI agree that all that road salt is bad for the environment, but your position is hypocritical, to say the least. \n \n \n MY position is hypocritical? It's hypocritical to condemn small amounts of pollution from private sources, and condone large amounts of pollution from public sources.\n \n \n \nIn all cases, the stations were either in the city, or in small towns. \n \n The cleanup was somewhat subsidized by the county and provincial gov't, but in the end, why should the taxpayer pay to clean up someone else's mess? Remember personal liberty? It brings with it personal responsibility. If you've got leaking tanks in the ground, it's your own personal problem to fix them, no one else's. \n\n \n Personal liberty should mean no one but the property owner should make the decision about clean up. Unless there's clear evidence that contamination can leech to adjoining property, it's no one else's business. \n \n \nIME, the cost of the clean up was made very clear to the customers up front, it was really a pretty simple thing to estimate. The fact that it was left out of two articles you found on the internet is a veryy weak basis for your assumption that all environmental clean up work is done on the sly with an unlimited budget.\n\n \n Environmental clean up costs are seldom clear because so many of them are INDIRECT costs. Either taxes, or business costs passed on to the consumer. I DID NOT find those articles on the internet. I found them in my local, mainstream newspaper, THEN looked them up on the net. They were local things from MY community, and that information was largely the only information available in my area.\n \n \n \nAgain, why are the people unsuspecting? That's a baseless assumption on your part. \n\n \n They are unsuspecting because most of the cost is indirect. The cost penetrates the economy like most people don't realize. It's not reported to them. IMO there would be quite an uproar if people could see some cost comparisons of, for example, how much cheaper per gallon gasoline would be without the 1998 tank testing regulations that rendered so many storage tanks useless. It was INDIRECTLY paid for, at the pump. \n \n \nIf the alternative is leave the hydrocarbons in the soil because you don't want to pay for the cleanup, TOUGH. I don't want the soil and my drinking water contaminated by your leaking tanks. \n\n \n How far is your drinking water source from those tanks, and how far can that petroleum leech through the ground? Something besides the emotions of a minority should figure into the decisions made on others private property.\n \n \nWho's personal freedom trumps whoms? \n\n \n Property owners, when there's no clear evidence that their actions infringe on others. Emotional cries of \"I wanna breath clean air\" may suffice in some types of societies, but not free ones.\n \n \n \nAgain, this is a ridiculous assertion. \n \n \n Not when you notice how much the U.S. EPA has grown in size, budget, and power over the last 35 years. Or how many new private environmental companies have started up in that time. \n \n By the way, I may come across as thinking the sun rises and sets on the U.S. and I honestly don't intend to do that. It's where I live, and I'm most concerned about U.S. laws. I do appreciate hearing from you Canadians and others how things are in your countries. Do you call it the ~EPA~ in Canada? How long has it been in existance? Does each province have it's own, or is there one for all of Canada?\n \n \nTheir method for growing is to continue to do good work and continue to develop new technology. \n\n \n You trust government or an environmental company completely, but believe product producing companies are likely to care only about money? IMO it more often than not goes the other way, because of how legalities and free markets work.\n \n \nTrust me, there's no shortage of work out there as it is, there's no shortage of competition for that work either though. \n\n \n There's a shortage of competition for government agencies.\n \n \n \nI agree that tanks not leaking and within their rated lifespan should not be required to be replaced. I also agree that MTBE is one of the biggest screw ups of the environmental lobby. \n\n \n Thanks for bringing up MTBE - how long ago was the screw up discovered? Three counties in my area STILL HAVE IT in gasoline. Government agencies are very slow at admitting their screw ups, aren't they? At the expence of my drinking water!! emoticon_mad I don't know exactly why - they can't be sued like a private company in exactly the same position sure as #&%$ would!!\n \n \nYou're certainly a jaded fellow. :p \n \n It was a gov't job LOL, she was paid by the hour. She would do all she could pass people's tanks, she wasn't in the business of shutting people down, but if your tanks leak, your tanks leak, that's just the way it is. She didn't have anything to gain personally from it. In fact, that's a rather assinine assumption on your part. \n\n \n Assinine? All I was doing was comparing her to another person doing the exact same job that shut down my aquaintance 1 mile up the road from me who had tanks that DIDN'T leak. He was probably paid by the hour too. He may be like the type of person this world has no shortage of, people who get their jollies giving other people orders. \n \n \nI don't recall the exact timeframe that station owners were given to replace the tanks, but IIRC, it was actually a substantial time period, somewhere in the neighborhood of 6 months to 1 year. \n\n \n My aquaintance up the road paid roughly $100,000 for his tanks in 1984. I don't know what it would be in today's dollars, but 6 months to 1 year isn't very substantial for someone pumping gas & fixing cars to cough it up. \n \n \nUnfortunately, when they were \"informed\" (most knew damn well their tanks leaked) many people simply walked away from the station and the cost of clean up, leaving the gov't with the tab. There are still hundreds, if not thousands, of sites out there that will likely never be cleaned up, or at the least, will be waiting a long time to be cleaned up. \n\n \n And some may have walked away from a building & land they owned, and got nothing for it. Years of work down the drain - their lives wiped out, when reasonable compromises could have been reached. And you're so surprised that your cousin got her life threatened?\n \n \n \n \nWhy is it that thousands of other environmentalists don't in the case of road salt? \n\n \n I don't see evidence that they exist. I'd like to see what they have to say - do you have any links?\n \n \nAt any rate, safety is very important. \n\n \n Auto crash safety is 100% UNRELATED to environmentalism.\n \n \n\"Private property rights\", what about my right to drink clean water? Breathe clean air? \n \n Again, who's rights are more important?\n \n Private property rights are great, but they are not a license to do as you please regardless of the consequences your actions may have for others. \n\n \n May have, or WILL have according to evidence, not emotion? Who decides?\n \n \n \n \nI don't mind missing the ramblings of \"economists\" that write like spoiled, immature teenagers. \n\n \n \n oooooookay :) \n \n \n \n \nThe only thing I can think of is the closing of some of my favourite areas to off highway vehicle use due to environmental concerns. It makes me mad, and I stand up to it where it's unwarranted, with a considerable amount of my own time and money invested. However, I understand it, and I even tend to agree with it to a certain extent. Unfortunately, it only takes a handful of XXXXXX to destroy an area that thousands of people use and enjoy without causing any damage.\n \n \n \n The regulation caused the boom, plain and simple, by forcing the manufacturers to develop the 4 stroke. The inflow of cash and advanced technology into motorcycling created far better bikes and a whole new market for them. IMHO, no EPA, we'd all still be riding the same 2 stroke MX'ers that they've been building largely unchanged since the mid 80's. \n\n \n I don't believe free markets need government regulation for incentive to build improved products.\n \n \n \nMost people aren't criminals, why should I have to pay for a police force?\n \n Do you have insurance? Been in an accident?\n \n Do you pay school taxes? Have any children currently attending school?\n \n This argument is a non sequitor. \n\n \n Those are different situations. Crime has always been around - politicians and people have centuries of experience dealing with it. Environmentalism is practically brand new, and still being defined. Insurance? Voluntary, until recently. Still should be IMO (another thread) I pay school taxes and have no kids in school, and don't mind. They'll be working and contributing to the same society that I live in.\n \n \n \n \nSo is it the testing, or the fact the company is based in California that actual bothers you? \n\n \n Both, equally.\n \n \n \n \nI'd hate to see the cost of operating without environmental regulations, or regulations such as those that you would favour.\n \n For a quick example of the impact of unregulated or poorly regulated environmental controls, look up the oil fields of Oklahoma/California, or the Turner Valley area of southern Alberta, right up into the late 60's.\n \n Or, as suggested, go for a swim in Lake Ontario.\n \n Waxy\n\n \n Look them up?

It's hypocritical to condemn small amounts of pollution from private sources, and condone large amounts of pollution from public sources.\n\n \n Yes, your position is hypocritical, regardless of whether or not you're willing to acknowledge it or not.\n \n \nPersonal liberty should mean no one but the property owner should make the decision about clean up. Unless there's clear evidence that contamination can leech to adjoining property, it's no one else's business. \n \n \n Are you serious?\n \n There is clear evidence. Tonnes of it. Simple grade school geography/geology tells us that ground water circulates, often over very large distances (100's of miles).\n \n NEVER, have I encountered a contaminated site where the contamination abruptly stopped at the surveyed boundaries of the owner's land. That's ridiculous.\n \n Further to that, the land owner should be be responsible not only for the clean up his own property should it be sold, but should be, and is, liable for any damages that his polluting has caused to adjoining landowners.\n \n \nThey are unsuspecting because most of the cost is indirect.

IMO there would be quite an uproar if people could see some cost comparisons of, for example, how much cheaper per gallon gasoline would be without the 1998 tank testing regulations that rendered so many storage tanks useless. It was INDIRECTLY paid for, at the pump. \n \n \n $0.000001/gallon maybe?\n \n IMHO, there would be very little uproar, if any. Partly because the effect of something like the 1998 tank testing regulations would barely be a blip on the price graph, but also because, IME, most intelligent people see the value in investing in the maintaining of a clean and healthy environment. \n \n \nHow far is your drinking water source from those tanks, and how far can that petroleum leech through the ground? Something besides the emotions of a minority should figure into the decisions made on others private property.\n\n \n In many cases, water sources are a matter of only hundreds of yards away.\n \n Petroleum/water in underground aquifers can travel 100s of miles. This is a WELL documented fact, and I can supply references for you if you'd like. \n \n Your refusal to acknowledge that these regulations are based on valid science doesn't invalidate them. There is no emotion involved is shutting down leaking gasoline tanks that are contaminating groundwater. If it were up to me, not only would the tanks be shut down, but the holder of the \"private property rights\" would be facing stiff fines for polluting the groundwater. \n \n \nProperty owners, when there's no clear evidence that their actions infringe on others. Emotional cries of \"I wanna breath clean air\" may suffice in some types of societies, but not free ones.\n\n \n No clear evidence? Again, where do you get this from? Your imagination?\n \n Breathing clean air and drinking clean water may just be \"emotional cries\" in your mind, but to the majority of people, they represent the very basics of survival, and are far more important than $$$ now. \n \n On top of that, clean air and water are the key to a strong population and a strong economy. \n \n \nNot when you notice how much the U.S. EPA has grown in size, budget, and power over the last 35 years. Or how many new private environmental companies have started up in that time. \n\n \n When you start from zero, there's no where to go but up.\n \n I won't argue that gov't agencies like the EPA are unwieldy and inefficient, of course they are, they're gov't agencies, but they're doing an important job. \n \n \nBy the way, I may come across as thinking the sun rises and sets on the U.S. and I honestly don't intend to do that. It's where I live, and I'm most concerned about U.S. laws. I do appreciate hearing from you Canadians and others how things are in your countries. Do you call it the ~EPA~ in Canada? How long has it been in existance? Does each province have it's own, or is there one for all of Canada?\n\n \n It's a mix. Water and oceans are strictly federal. Most other regulations are a mixture of federal and provincial regulation.\n \n There isn't an \"EPA\" as such in Canada, but rather an number of smaller gov't agencies.\n \n \nYou trust government or an environmental company completely, but believe product producing companies are likely to care only about money? IMO it more often than not goes the other way, because of how legalities and free markets work.\n\n \n Where have I stated that? Or are you just assuming/placing words in my mouth?\n \n There are many private companies that have exceptional environmental records, there are many that don't. On top of that, I certainly don't implicitly trust gov't or the environmental lobby on any issue - my stance on global warming should be more than enough proof of that.\n \n What are you basing that opinion on? \n \n All of the good will and stringent environmental practies that large corporations were undertaking before the advent of environmental regulations? \n \n Large corporations flocking to overseas locations were environmental regulation are largely non-existant to maximize profits? \n \n I think your glasses are a little rose coloured in this situation.\n \n \nAssinine?

To automatically assume that someone in that position would actually work on the basis of what would essentially be a commision for shutting people down, and to assume that a person would actually \"get their jollies\" by closing down the source of someone's livelihood. \n \n \nMy aquaintance up the road paid roughly $100,000 for his tanks in 1984. I don't know what it would be in today's dollars, but 6 months to 1 year isn't very substantial for someone pumping gas & fixing cars to cough it up. \n \n \n Life's tough. IMHO, they should be thankful there are no legal ramifications for the polluting they've been doing for the last 20-50 years.\n \n In this particualr case, where he wasn't polluting, it's a tougher call.\n \n Regardless, allowing a year to \"get it together\" so to speak seems reasonable to me. \n \n \nAnd some may have walked away from a building & land they owned, and got nothing for it. Years of work down the drain - their lives wiped out, when reasonable compromises could have been reached. And you're so surprised that your cousin got her life threatened?\n\n \n So you would condone, or at least understand, the \"kill the messenger\" mentality? Why am I not surprised.\n \n Isn't a big part of \"personal property rights\" accepting the responsibility that goes along with those rights, or does that only apply when it's convenient?\n \n According to your theory above, the private land holder/business owner should be striving to be 100% pollution free due to market pressure and legal liabilities, why isn't that happening? Could it be profit?\n \n What would you deem a reasonable compromise?\n \n \nMay have, or WILL have according to evidence, not emotion? Who decides?\n\n \n There's plenty of evidence. For crying out loud, there's been entire Hollywood movies based around some these situations.\n \n Scientists decide. People trained in the field with appropriate experience and credentials. \n \n The only emotion I see here is coming from you.\n \n \nI don't believe free markets need government regulation for incentive to build improved products.\n\n \n Nor do I, but in this particular case, the correlation is undeniable.\n \n \nThose are different situations. Crime has always been around - politicians and people have centuries of experience dealing with it. Environmentalism is practically brand new, and still being defined. Insurance? Voluntary, until recently. Still should be IMO (another thread) I pay school taxes and have no kids in school, and don't mind. They'll be working and contributing to the same society that I live in.\n\n \n Why are they different? Answer - They aren't.\n \n Pollution hasn't always been around? Of course it has, as long as man has been around, and especially for the last 2-300 years.\n \n We're learning to deal with it, we've got a long way to go, and it won't be easy or cheap, much like dealing with criminals.\n \n Insurance is mandatory in Alberta.\n \n So you see no problem with school taxes because you feel they'll provide you, and society in general, with a tangible benefit in the future, but you're opposed to environmental regulations and the associated \"indirect costs\". \n \n Hypocrital again, to say the least. If you can't leave a clean and prosperous environment to your children, what's the difference whether they're educated or not, where will they work?\n \n \nLook them up? Is there information about them that's not been written by and for environmentalists?\n\n \n Yes, but, what does it matter?\n \n If you want info about rocket science, do you ask a rocket scientist or a garbage man?\n \n Look up those areas, I'm guessing even you would be appaled at how the environment was treated until regulations were put in place - regulations much of the industry fought tooth and nail. If nothing else, it makes for some very interesting historical reading. \n \n Waxy",

So if an underground tank from the 50's is discoverd to have been leaking for years, evidence of it would be miles away? You could dig miles away from it and find traces of gasoline? I'd have to see it with my own eyes. I've lived in the same house all my life. Decades ago, my brothers and I pulled out many an engine-trans-rear axle-gas tank in a field beside the house. I couldn't even guess how many gallons of gasoline / oil hit the ground. The cistern I still drink from today is about 400 feet away. I pump it dry and clean it every couple of years. No traces of petroleum that I can see, I do see some streaks near the top in the masonry cracks that show ground water gets in when it rains hard. I'm not completely defiant, I don't drink as much of it as I used to, and I avoid spilling gas and oil like I used to. But I'm still here! I\"m sure I'll outlive a few more healthnuts before I'm done.\n \n \n \n \n$0.000001/gallon maybe?\n \n \n Maybe, but considering the cost of replacing that many tanks, maybe not.\n \n \nIMHO, there would be very little uproar, if any. Partly because the effect of something like the 1998 tank testing regulations would barely be a blip on the price graph, but also because, IME, most intelligent people see the value in investing in the maintaining of a clean and healthy environment. \n \n \n Several stations around here closed in 98, and were never re-opened. I'm sure that's typical across the U.S. Less stations = more driving to get to gas. Of course more new stations were built - more cost. All trucks that deliver products buy fuel, and pass on the cost. There's more, it all adds up.\n \n \n \n \nIn many cases, water sources are a matter of only hundreds of yards away.\n \n Petroleum/water in underground aquifers can travel 100s of miles. This is a WELL documented fact, and I can supply references for you if you'd like. \n\n \n I'd like to see them. \n \n \nYour refusal to acknowledge that these regulations are based on valid science doesn't invalidate them. There is no emotion involved is shutting down leaking gasoline tanks that are contaminating groundwater. If it were up to me, not only would the tanks be shut down, but the holder of the \"private property rights\" would be facing stiff fines for polluting the groundwater. \n\n \n Don't most people who live in areas where much activity at all is going on, get their drinking water from a water treatment plant? Are these plants not capable of purifying the water? \n \n \n \nNo clear evidence? Again, where do you get this from? Your imagination? \n\n \n My home situation that I described above. You don't have to believe it, but I know it's true.\n \n \nBreathing clean air and drinking clean water may just be \"emotional cries\" in your mind, but to the majority of people, they represent the very basics of survival, and are far more important than $$$ now. \n \n On top of that, clean air and water are the key to a strong population and a strong economy. \n\n \n Different people have different definitions of \"clean\". When presented with cleaning costs, their definitions tend to change. They're not being allowed enough involvement in the process IMO. \n \n \n \n \nWhen you start from zero, there's no where to go but up. \n\n \n And nowhere to stop, no matter how \"clean\" things get.\n \n \nI won't argue that gov't agencies like the EPA are unwieldy and inefficient, of course they are, they're gov't agencies, but they're doing an important job. \n\n \n Some of it is important, I agree. But not enough to justify ALL the cost.\n \n \n \n \nWhere have I stated that? Or are you just assuming/placing words in my mouth? \n \n There are many private companies that have exceptional environmental records, there are many that don't. On top of that, I certainly don't implicitly trust gov't or the environmental lobby on any issue - my stance on global warming should be more than enough proof of that.\n \n What are you basing that opinion on? \n\n \n \nThere's a responsibility to do more than simply make money that comes with being a business owner. I know you'll disagree. \n\n \n Statements like that are a pretty strong hint of it. \n \n \nAll of the good will and stringent environmental practies that large corporations were undertaking before the advent of environmental regulations? \n\n \n That was sarcasm, I trust. Another hint of it. Common sense and a free press worked just a little bit before the wonderful government got involved. \n \n \nLarge corporations flocking to overseas locations were environmental regulation are largely non-existant to maximize profits? \n \n I think your glasses are a little rose coloured in this situation. \n\n \n Largely non-existant, or more reasonable?\n \n \n \nYes assinine. To automatically assume that someone in that position would actually work on the basis of what would essentially be a commision for shutting people down, and to assume that a person would actually \"get their jollies\" by closing down the source of someone's livelihood.\n\n \n You've never seen a little wanna-be tyrant in action at a local level? Visit the U.S. sometime. I saw on another message board where an OTR trucker in California got a ticket for smoking (alone) in his truck. Violated \"smoking in the workplace\" law. That cop would make a great EPA agent. \n \n \n \n \nLife's tough. IMHO, they should be thankful there are no legal ramifications for the polluting they've been doing for the last 20-50 years.\n \n In this particualr case, where he wasn't polluting, it's a tougher call.\n \n Regardless, allowing a year to \"get it together\" so to speak seems reasonable to me. \n\n \n Six figures is a lot of getting together for a one or two man business. Have you ever been self employed? \n \n \n \n \nSo you would condone, or at least understand, the \"kill the messenger\" mentality? Why am I not surprised. \n\n \n I don't condone revenge killing, of course. But I understand if somone else would in these circumstances. I am self employed. \n \n \nIsn't a big part of \"personal property rights\" accepting the responsibility that goes along with those rights, or does that only apply when it's convenient? \n\n \n It applies when that \"responsibility\" is defined by correct interpretation of the U.S. Constitution. \n \n \nAccording to your theory above, the private land holder/business owner should be striving to be 100% pollution free due to market pressure and legal liabilities, why isn't that happening? Could it be profit? \n\n \n My theory is that \"100%\" isn't necessary. There is an acceptable, realistic level, suitable for a free society.\n \n \nWhat would you deem a reasonable compromise? \n\n \n A case by case basis. The problem with government agencies is that so much of their requirement has to be documented, with certain rules applicable to many situations, so their robot employees can match rules and commands. \n \n \n \nThere's plenty of evidence. For crying out loud, there's been entire Hollywood movies based around some these situations. \n\n \n HOLLYWOOD MOVIES?? Townhall columnists are \"spoiled, immature teenagers\", and Hollywood is a better information source?? Please, just a few seconds of your time to read a small paragraph from a spoiled, immature teenager; \n \n \nCalifornia's San Bernardino County was just about ready to build a new hospital. That was until the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Department discovered that the endangered flower-loving Delhi Sands fly was found on the site. The county had to spend $4.5 million to move the hospital 250 feet; it also had to divert funds from its medical mission to pay for mandated Delhi Sands fly studies. \n\n \n That wan't a movie script. That was the real world. \n \n \n \n \nWhy are they different? Answer - They aren't.\n \n Pollution hasn't always been around? Of course it has, as long as man has been around, and especially for the last 2-300 years. \n\n \n Sacrificing money and freedom to deal with it hasn't been around very long.\n \n \nWe're learning to deal with it, we've got a long way to go, and it won't be easy or cheap, much like dealing with criminals.\n \n Insurance is mandatory in Alberta.\n \n So you see no problem with school taxes because you feel they'll provide you, and society in general, with a tangible benefit in the future, but you're opposed to environmental regulations and the associated \"indirect costs\". \n \n Hypocrital again, to say the least. If you can't leave a clean and prosperous environment to your children, what's the difference whether they're educated or not, where will they work? \n\n \n Environmentalism is much more vague and hard to define. \n \n \n \nYes, but, what does it matter? \n\n \n It matters what their motives are.\n \n \nIf you want info about rocket science, do you ask a rocket scientist or a garbage man? \n\n \n If I want info about the feasability of a rocket science program at taxpayers expence, I ask the taxpaying garbage man every time.\n \n \nLook up those areas, I'm guessing even you would be appaled at how the environment was treated until regulations were put in place - regulations much of the industry fought tooth and nail. If nothing else, it makes for some very interesting historical reading. \n \n Waxy\n\n \n I may just do that, but I'll also see if I can find anything on what the arguments of the industry were too.",

   "PMY position is hypocritical? It's hypocritical to condemn small amounts of pollution from private sources, and condone large amounts of pollution from public sources.\n\n I won't say it's hypocritical, but it's certainly disingenuous to ignore the relative toxicity of the substances involved. A \"large amount\" of something that's already present in the human body and in fact necessary for that body to function might indeed be preferable to a \"small amount\" of something as toxic as gasoline or MTBE. Quantity is important, but that shouldn't be spun to mean it's the only factor to consider.\n \nPersonal liberty should mean no one but the property owner should make the decision about clean up. Unless there's clear evidence that contamination can leech to adjoining property, it's no one else's business. \n\n Absolutely wrong. In the old Chelsea salt works, there used to be a problem with ground subsidence, causing buildings to collapse etc. It was absolutely impossible then, and probably still would be today, to attribute a particular subsidence to a particular salt mine, but the fact remained that the salt miners as a group were causing the destruction of other people's property. The solution was to require that miners pay into an insurance fund, based on the quantity of salt they produced, with the fund proceeds being used to pay those affected by subsidence. Pollution is just like that. It's generally difficult if not impossible to trace a specific harm to a specific polluter, especially when the effects might not be noticeable for decades, but that doesn't mean a debt isn't owed. Given that the cost might not be recoverable after the harm is done, it must be prevented from being incurred.\n \nHow far is your drinking water source from those tanks, and how far can that petroleum leech through the ground?\n\n A very long way. As soon as it hits the water table, which is often not far underground, it can diffuse quite rapidly. Aquifers are like rivers and lakes underground, with the same capability of spreading pollution over long distances.\n \nThanks for bringing up MTBE - how long ago was the screw up discovered? Three counties in my area STILL HAVE IT in gasoline. Government agencies are very slow at admitting their screw ups, aren't they?\n\n Are you trying to claim that the slow response is due to the EPA itself, and not to industry pressure?\n \nI don't believe free markets need government regulation for incentive to build improved products.\n\n It depends on what you mean by \"improved\" doesn't it? If \"improved\" means more appealing to the buyer but with greater cost/risk for others, then yes, regulation is needed. Ditto if the product itself is fine but the processes for making it place a burden (e.g. pollution) on others.\n \nNo, it's the opinion of the person that owns the vehicle, the only person that matters in a free society. \n\n Wrong. To the extent that the person's use of that vehicle affects others, their opinions matter too. Your right to swing your fist ends at the tip of my nose.\n \nIn my area, we see no comparisons of today's air vs. yesterdays air before the testing began. Without those comparisons, your definitions of \"clean air\" aren't well enough defined IMO.\n\n Even if it truly were impossible to measure air quality before direct measurement started, that wouldn't justify ignoring the problem. In any case it's not impossible. Tree-ring studies, for example, provide strong indications of air quality prior to direct measurement.\n \nThe EPA may not be 100% corrupt, but IMO it is one of the most corrupt bureaucracies in the U.S.\n\n Indeed it is, but not for the reasons you think. The source of its corruption is its close ties to the industries it supposedly polices, and its tendency to safeguard those interests instead of the public's.\n \nCommon sense and a free press worked just a little bit before the wonderful government got involved. \n\n Wrong yet again. Study the history of the EPA. You'll find that it was created specifically as a response to industry failure to act in the real world as your utopian dreams suggest. Government typically does not institute regulation just for the hell of it. A regulatory agency might outgrow its mandate, or become obsolete due to technological/social change, but the initial reasons for any agency's creation are usually pretty strong. All you need to do is not turn a blind eye to history.\n \nIt applies when that \"responsibility\" is defined by correct interpretation of the U.S. Constitution. \n\n And who made you the judge of what's a correct interpretation? I think Congress (which created the agencies you oppose) and the Supreme Court (which supported them) might know a thing or two about constitutional interpretation that you don't. Yes, correct interpretation matters, which means your interpretation doesn't.",

Quantity is important, but that shouldn't be spun to mean it's the only factor to consider. \n\n \n That would be true if the ratio was 60% salt vs. 40% petroleum, or 70% salt vs. 30% petroleum, etc. But it's not, it's more like 99% salt vs. 1% petroleum. And the percentages keep moving in the same direction. Road salt usage keeps going up. As old steel underground petroleum tanks deteriorate, and are replaced by newer higher tech non steel ones, petroleum pollution goes down. And it's not completely because of the EPA, it's because as steel tanks leak and deteriorate, the leaks get worse so that eventually it's not economical to keep using them.\n \n \nAbsolutely wrong.

It's probably more likely or less likely in different types of soil.

If no government agency was involved, if it was all private, there would have been a very quick response. If Enron would have recommended that we put MTBE in gasoline, for example.\n \n \nIt depends on what you mean by \"improved\" doesn't it? If \"improved\" means more appealing to the buyer but with greater cost/risk for others, then yes, regulation is needed.

In any case it's not impossible. Tree-ring studies, for example, provide strong indications of air quality prior to direct measurement. \n\n \n Reasonable proof should exist, before liberties are destroyed by unelected government agencies.

The source of its corruption is its close ties to the industries it supposedly polices, and its tendency to safeguard those interests instead of the public's. \n\n \n Those are exactly the reasons I think. If a government agency is in bed with a private company, who is the more guilty one? I think it's the one that is supported by taxpayers, with no competetive incentive.\n \n The vast majority of the public owns, works for, or buys products from medium & small businesses who do not have close ties with the EPA.\n \n \n \nWrong yet again.

All you need to do is not turn a blind eye to history. \n\n \n \"does not institute regulation just for the hell of it\" - Really? The framers of the Constitution may not have agreed with you. Shall we check a few phrases from the Bill of Rights?\n \n \"shall make no law\"\n \"shall not be infringed\"\n \"no soldier shall be quartered\"\n \"unreasonable searches and seizures\"\n \"no person shall be held\"\n \"nor shall private property be taken\"\n \"shall not be required\"\n \"shall not be construed\"\n \n The framers had first hand knowledge of \"regulation just for the hell of it\". They didn't have their senses dulled by 200+ years of relative freedom.\n \n Have you ever heard of a country collapsing because of oppressive government? Have you ever heard of a country collapsing because they polluted themselves to death?? \n \n It isn't ME who's turning a blind eye to history.\n \n \n \n \nAnd who made you the judge of what's a correct interpretation? I think Congress (which created the agencies you oppose) and the Supreme Court (which supported them) might know a thing or two about constitutional interpretation that you don't. Yes, correct interpretation matters, which means your interpretation doesn't.\n\n \n My interpretation means little? - Congress and the Supreme Court can be trusted completely with interpreting the Constitution? Don't think George Washington agreed with you here either.\n \n \n If men are to be precluded from offering their sentiments on a matter which may involve the most serious and alarming consequences that can invite the consideration of mankind, reason is of no use to us; the freedom of speech may be taken away, and dumb and silent we may be led like sheep to the slaughter. \n\n \n I don't care how smart John McCain and Russ Feingold think they are, the words \"Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech\" are understandable by just about anybody, understandable enough to know that their \"campaign reform\" law was UNCONSTITUTIONAL. \n \n Do you completely trust Congress and the Supreme Court - is reason of any use to you?",

   "That would be true if the ratio was 60% salt vs. 40% petroleum, or 70% salt vs. 30% petroleum, etc. But it's not, it's more like 99% salt vs. 1% petroleum.\n\n So a toxicity difference of millions to one matters less to you than a volume difference of a mere hundred to one? Learn some math.\n \nIf it's not possible to forsee it, how is it possible to prevent it from being incurred? Guess? Err on the side of safety?\n\n Basically yes, but without the prejudicial language. The best scientific predictions and estimates - which are not just guesses - should be used, and the precautionary principle applied.\n \nIf it is discovered that a guess that cost someone money or liberty turned out to be false, should the guesser be held accountable?\n\n First, let's stop tying money and liberty together all the time. I know laissez-fairies think that property rights are the only kind that matter, but there are other kinds of liberty that rational people consider more important. Money is the only thing really at stake here.\n \n Yes, bad estimates will happen. One kind of bad estimate is assuming nothing bad will happen and doing nothing. It's a simple matter of risk management. It's better that several catastrophes be avoided, even if that also means one false alarm, than that we sit back and let everything go to hell. As long as our action - or inaction - is guided by scientifically valid estimations of risk and cost, we'll be better off. We tried the other way. It sucked. As I said before, learn the history of the EPA and similar agencies before you criticize.\n \nI gave my own personal example that says that's not true.\n\n Personal examples don't mean squat. After you finish learning basic math, learn basic statistics as well. Other people have their own \"personal examples\" which conflict with yours, and the only way to make a rational decision is to get past anecdotes to the statistical reality.\n \nIt's probably more likely or less likely in different types of soil. If the water table IS far underground, or non existant in certain areas, should rules be the same in those areas as they are in areas where porus soil is a problem?\n\n No, probably not. There's no reason such factors can't be accounted for.\n \nIf no government agency was involved, if it was all private, there would have been a very quick response.\n\n That's a strong prediction. What is it based on? Absolutely nothing is my guess, unless self-interest counts as a reason. These types of pollution existed for decades, ever since use of gasoline became widespread, without the private sector doing a damn thing to address it. They had no incentive to do so, and you should know that markets are all about incentives. There was no incentive to avoid polluting, so there was no effort.\n \nCosts/risks, burdens. Who decides, free markets in a constitutionally limited government, or a government agency?\n\n Free markets, but free markets don't just happen by themselves. A market characterized by perverse incentives and ignored externalities is not truly a free market. Markets are powerful things, and market mechanisms should be used to handle whatever kinds of resource allocation etc. that they can, but sometimes they need a bit of a nudge.\n \n You also seem to be missing the point that government isn't something that is imposed on the people from outside, and treating it as such is just a cop-out to avoid responsibility. The government and all of its agencies is us, the people, acting in their collective and democratic interest. Yes, government power is constitutionally limited, but that doesn't mean it's totally proscribed.\n \nHow can tree ring studies differentiate between man made pollution and natural pollution, such as volcanic activity?\n\n It's not hard, actually, since the two leave different chemical traces. Look it up. Educate yourself, instead of demanding that others education for free. Nobody loves a leech.\n \n\"does not institute regulation just for the hell of it\" - Really? The framers of the Constitution may not have agreed with you. Shall we check a few phrases from the Bill of Rights?\n\n You forgot \"general welfare\" and \"to protect these rights governments are instituted among men\" (indicating recognition that rights might not be preserved otherwise). I guess you like to pick and choose which parts of the Declaration and Constitution you care about, but it's an utterly transparent and childish ploy. The founders were well aware of the dangers both of too much government and of too little. Government is not the only agent that can deny liberty, and is necessary as a counterweight to others that are even less subject to popular will or constitutional limitation.\n \nThe framers had first hand knowledge of \"regulation just for the hell of it\". They didn't have their senses dulled by 200+ years of relative freedom.\n\n The ones whose senses are dulled are those who think that freedom (and opportunity which is its complement) just kind of happened and did not require positive action by the government to preserve it.\n \nHave you ever heard of a country collapsing because of oppressive government?\n\n Yes, but I've also noticed a lot of countries collapsing because of too little. If you don't like living where there's a social contract that might inconvenience you, try living in Afghanistan or Sierra Leone. That's the kind of society (or non-society, really) that you'd give us, whether you know/admit it or not. Those places are rather hellish compared to the US, but that's the point. Since you don't seem to believe in American ideals, I suggest you try those alternatives. Good luck to you.\n \nMy interpretation means little? - Congress and the Supreme Court can be trusted completely with interpreting the Constitution?\n\n Did I say completely, or anything that meant it the way your paraphrase does? Putting words in other people's mouths is another example of childish non-debate. As long as you engage in such tactics in lieu of facts and reason, you fall further behind in every round.",

   "Do you think this might have a correlation to toxicity and the severity of the problem? emoticon_rolleyes \n \n How many times do I have to explain it? \n\n \n Once would be real nice. You haven't addressed it at all. You're very convincing about how bad petroleum is, but you've done nothing to show that salt is comparatively harmless.\n \n \n \n \nYes, evidence could certainly be found miles away, depending on the amount of fuel that leaked, and the geology of the area.\n \n Go outside your house and dig around in those old spots. Is the oil still there? What does it look like, pretty much the same as when you dumped it?\n \n You're aware of the fact that you don't have to be able to see the petroleum in water for it to be toxic right? \n \n It's soluble components in gasoline (benzene, toluene, etc...) that are the most toxic, and the most mobile.\n \n Ever wonder why cancer rates are on the rise? \n\n \n I suspect it could largely be due to current eating habits and exercise habits. 2/3 of Americans are said to be overweight today, as opposed to less than 1/2 in the early 60's. We can't blame everything on petroleum leaks from small businesses.\n \n \n \n \nhttp://ewr.cee.vt.edu/environmental/teach/gwprimer/btex/btex.html#1.%20Introduction\n \n http://gis.esri.com/library/userconf/proc01/professional/papers/pap213/p213.htm\n \n http://www.skidmore.edu/~jthomas/fairlysimpleexercises/gwasessment.html - this one might be particularly useful for you.\n \n http://www.hillsdalecounty.info/planningeduc0020.asp\n \n http://research.esd.ornl.gov/hydrology/WAG5/\n \n http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/topogeo/groundwater/bad_hydro.aspx - a counter point link describing limitation on groundwater flow.\n \n Is that enough for you? \n\n \n It's enough on petroleum, not enough on salt. The fourth one's table of problems and cures did include salt, however. Let's compare two of the proposed solutions from that link.\n \n On underground storage tanks,\n \n \nPrevention:\n - Proper installation, maintenance, leak testing and inventory control.\n - Permit compliance.\n - Leak backup containment.\n - Removal of abandoned tanks or filling with inert material.\n\n \n 4 big checkmarks - plenty of private property invaded, plenty of money spent.\n \n Now for road salt\n \n \nPrevention:\n - Proper protection of salt storage.\n - Minimize use of salt.\n - Use alternative deicing materials.\n\n \n Three big failures. I noticed a wide open salt storage bin in Cincinnati right along I-75 just a week or so ago. The next two are an equal joke of course. In 1965-66, only 2 million tons of road salt were used all across the U.S. \n \n http://emml.mtu.edu/gem/community/publications/wellspring/deicingdebate.html\n \n Today, it's 15 million. What is going to stop it from increasing further? Why couldn't we cut back to 60's levels, for the environment? We have built more roads since the 60's but the percentage is fairly small. Except for the beltways and a few extensions, our interstate system was in place in the 60's. Instead of 2 million tons, why don't we allow for the extra roads and make it 3 million? A little more plowing, a little more dicipline in driving habits, we could even have a tax refund for 12 million tons of salt! It would be a drop in the bucket of course, but all the accumulated taxes that now cost us almost half of our income came one drop-in-the-bucket at a time. The public would grumble, but no more than they do at auto emissions testing. The big problem would be ~insurance lobbyists~, that's where the problem lies! Money & corruption - that's what causes the environmental double standard that you can't disprove.\n \n \n \n \nGroundwater and even hydrocarbons in the subsurface are capable of migrating 1000kms, small distances are a \"drop in the bucket\" so to speak.\n\n \n Is this from one of your links above? From your second link;\n \n \nHundreds of millions of years ago, Southeast Minnesota was covered by a warm, shallow sea. \n\n \n How can we know where \"fact\" ends, and evolutionary/environmental propaganda begins?\n \n \n \nYes and no. It can be done, it is costly. Why not eliminate the source of the problem rather than putting a band aid on it?\n \n Besides, why change the subject now?\n\n \n The subject is groundwater pollution - no subject change at all. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n Except for rainwater, it's not really safe to drink any water from a stream or pond. You never know if a dead animal is rotting in the water up around the bend. Any water in a city water system is treated. The water entering a treatment plant can be dirty in varying degrees, and will come out the clean end safe to drink. It's not a band aid, water treatment plants can't be made cheaper just because the EPA says it's \"eliminated the source of the problem\". The EPA is never going to claim that anyway, there's always more to be done. If they ever permenantly \"eliminate\" pollutions sources, their funding could be in jeopardy.\n \n \n \nI'm sure you \"know\" a lot of things are true.\n\n \n I know things that I personally experience a lot better than I know where warm, shallow seas were hundreds of millions of years ago. \n \n \n \n \nYep, right. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \n \n What's justifiable?\n \n Who decides?\n \n Someone like yourself with only a very limited understanding of the subject and limited anecdotal evidence, or trained scientists and other experts? \n\n \n Not just myself, but people collectively. People have a right to question why private pollution is bad, but government pollution is not a problem.\n \n I\n \nStatements like that are a hint of nothing. You made an assumption based on your preconceived notions, and when challenged, you couldn't back it up. \n\n \n They are a hint of plenty, because there is often NO DIFFERENCE between your posts and those of a rabid environmentalist. I did read through the \"global warming\" thread. It is amazing - you seemed like a different person there. In this thread, I can see no difference between your reasoning and the reasoning of a global warming alarmist.\n \n \n \n \nA hint of my mistrust of private enterprise and capitalism when it comes to the environment? You're darn right. I'm just as leary of most government agencies. \n\n \n But you give them a FREE PASS on road salt? \n \n \nI'm glad you picked up the sarcasm in this one, despite the other two being dripping with it, you seemed to have missed it.\n \n As far as the effectiveness of \"common sense and a free press\", apparently the point of the sarcasm was completely lost on you. \n\n \n Oh no no no no no, I caught it, I just didn't say anything, I was being polite. :p So you're MORE LEARY of common sense and a free press, than most government agencies?? \n \n \n \n \nI can only shake my head at this one. Do you want to live in Mexico City? \n\n \n If I was running a filling station and wanted to be left alone, I probably would.\n \n \n \n \nYes I have. \n \n What's your point? \n\n \n My point is this ~ many people who work as an employee, on a tax withholding payroll, with benefits, vacation, sick days etc. can have a hard time understanding why a service they require (a roof on their house, a major repair on their car) requires them to pay 4 or 5 times their own hourly rate to a worker/workers who very well may be less skilled than they themselves are. They don't understand normal business operating expences, let alone operating expences involved in a government as large as the U.S. currently is. I've been reading your posts long enough to know you have a grasp of it, but your comment about 6 months to a year being plenty of time for a one or two man business to scare up six figures didn't indicate it.\n \n \n \n \n \n I knew you were rather fanatical before I engaged in this debate, but I'm getting a glimpse of just how fanatical you are. \n\n \n Much of the U.S. could be considered fanatical according to you. One of our founders said \"when the government fears the people, there is liberty. When the people fear the government, there is tyranny. \n \n Did you hear about the U.S Supreme Court ruling today? Eventually someone will die over that one - I hope it's a long time away and I hope it's rare. Much better if it's a government agent than a private citizen, but either way, their death won't be in vain. We'll learn from it.\n \n \n \n And that would save money how? \n\n \n That one's about liberty far more than money.\n \n \n \n \nThe point here, since I seem to have to spell everything out for you, is that this situation is so common, and is so much a part of general public knowledge, that Hollywood has even made movies about it. (Erin Brokovich for one) It has nothing to do with using Hollywood as a source of information. \n\n \n So common, part of public knowledge? You have it backwards. The only way a lot all the public got the knowledge was from the propaganda movie. Some people vote based on nothing more than what they hear on late night comedy TV. Why aren't any movies made showing the waste of moving a hospital to avoid disturbing the Delhi Sands Fly?\n \n \n \n \nPlease do.\n\n \n Haven't had a chance to do that yet. Did some checking on salt though - it seems to be a REAL problem. I won't bother to link you - I'm sure you know about it.\n \n \nThen, do a little more digging and find out what the effects of the new environmental regulations were on the industry. \n\n \n No new regulations on salt.",

Yes, government power is constitutionally limited, but that doesn't mean it's totally proscribed. \n\n \n Different government agencies seem to have different standards. We see police cars, fire trucks, ambulances all the time. They are paid for by taxpayers, and those in charge of them often seem to take pride in them. We sometimes see police cars with slogans on them, \"to protect and serve\". We see jurisdiction names proudly displayed on them. Even school district vehicles have emblems on them, often with the words \"for official use only\". Schools, jails, police stations, firehouses, what legitimate group couldn't get a polite tour of them upon request? Tell me please, when was the last time you saw a vehicle with ~EPA~ emblazoned on it's side? The EPA has vehicles - I sometimes see them on job sites. Unmarked, luxury SUV's. Have you ever seen an EPA office? There's one in Cincinnati. It's like a fortress. In my business I was involved in parking lot pavement work on it. Armed guards watched me very closely. High fences, security gates, not inviting at all. What do they do in there that they want no one to see? How many other government agencies are shrouded in mystery and secrecy? \n \n Couldn't they project a more positive public image if they were more outgoing, like a police dept? In addition to having their gas guzzling SUV's marked with attractive letters, they could have pictures of sparkling waterfalls, or smiling trees on them. They could invite school children to tour their taxpayer funded offices. Or could it be that they're afraid of what the childrens parents might think about how their hard earned tax money is being spent? \n \n \nIt's not hard, actually, since the two leave different chemical traces. Look it up. Educate yourself, instead of demanding that others education for free. Nobody loves a leech.\n\n \n Would these be the trees that lived in the same area where the warm, shallow sea was hundreds of millions of years ago? Are they smarter than trees without such an impressive background? Should we give them the right to vote? \n \n \n \nYou forgot \"general welfare\" and \"to protect these rights governments are instituted among men\" (indicating recognition that rights might not be preserved otherwise).

Who's really picking and choosing? General welfare? Here's what James Madison had to say;\n \n \"With respect to the two words 'general welfare', I have always regarded them as qualified by the detail of powers connected with them. To take them in a literal and unlimited sense would be a metamorphsis of the constitution into a character which there is a host of proofs was not contemplated by it's creators.\"\n \n I think he's saying that there are ways a government can promote the general welfare, provided it doesn't violate parts of the constitution. The way the EPA sometimes declares private property \"wetlands\" or an endangered species preserve, and then denies the landowner use of it without paying him for it, violates the last line of the 5th amendment.\n \n \n \nThe founders were well aware of the dangers both of too much government and of too little. Government is not the only agent that can deny liberty, and is necessary as a counterweight to others that are even less subject to popular will or constitutional limitation. \n\n \n Do you have examples of \"others\"?\n \n \nThe ones whose senses are dulled are those who think that freedom (and opportunity which is its complement) just kind of happened and did not require positive action by the government to preserve it. \n\n \n The one's whose senses are REALLY dull are those who think freedom is a gift from government. \"Endowed by their creator\" - ever hear the phrase before?\n \n \nYes, but I've also noticed a lot of countries collapsing because of too little. If you don't like living where there's a social contract that might inconvenience you, try living in Afghanistan or Sierra Leone. That's the kind of society (or non-society, really) that you'd give us, whether you know/admit it or not. Those places are rather hellish compared to the US, but that's the point.

I think Congress (which created the agencies you oppose) and the Supreme Court (which supported them) might know a thing or two about constitutional interpretation that you don't. Yes, correct interpretation matters, which means your interpretation doesn't. \n\n \n Translating your sarcastic \"might know a thing or two\" into \"completely\" wasn't that far off.

Except for the beltways and a few extensions, our interstate system was in place in the 60's. Instead of 2 million tons, why don't we allow for the extra roads and make it 3 million? A little more plowing, a little more dicipline in driving habits, we could even have a tax refund for 12 million tons of salt! It would be a drop in the bucket of course, but all the accumulated taxes that now cost us almost half of our income came one drop-in-the-bucket at a time. The public would grumble, but no more than they do at auto emissions testing. The big problem would be ~insurance lobbyists~, that's where the problem lies! Money & corruption - that's what causes the environmental double standard that you can't disprove.\n\n \n You seem to be operating under the two wrongs make a right method.\n \n I don't really see how the evils of salt have anything to do with the evils of hydrocarbon.\n \n You scream blue murder about salt, then in the same breath criticize regulations on hydrocarbons. (Some might call this hypocritical.) \n \n The real kicker is, you justify your opposition to hydrocarbons by pointing out how poorly we're dealing with salt.\n \n Can you honestly not see the flaw in that reasoning?\n \n \n \nIs this from one of your links above? From your second link;\n \n How can we know where \"fact\" ends, and evolutionary/environmental propaganda begins?\n\n \n emoticon_rolleyes \n \n I didn't know you were a creationist. That explains a lot - particularly your total lack of scientific knowledge.\n \n Here's a link to the Minnesota Geological Survey. Educate yourself.\n \n http://www.geo.umn.edu/mgs/\n \n \nExcept for rainwater, it's not really safe to drink any water from a stream or pond. You never know if a dead animal is rotting in the water up around the bend. Any water in a city water system is treated. The water entering a treatment plant can be dirty in varying degrees, and will come out the clean end safe to drink. It's not a band aid, water treatment plants can't be made cheaper just because the EPA says it's \"eliminated the source of the problem\". The EPA is never going to claim that anyway, there's always more to be done. If they ever permenantly \"eliminate\" pollutions sources, their funding could be in jeopardy.\n\n \n I'm sure you'll do your best to maintain the need for agencies like the EPA.\n \n Removing dissolved hydrocarbons, particularly benzene, toluene, etc... is VERY difficult to impossible, not to mention VERY expensive, and most water treatment facilities are not equipped to do so. \n \n If you want to pay the taxes to modify your water treatment plant so that Joe Sixpack can continue to dump petroleum on his private property, I guess that's your perogative. \n \n I perfer to nip the problem in the bud, it's cheaper that way.\n \n \nI know things that I personally experience a lot better than I know where warm, shallow seas were hundreds of millions of years ago. \n \n \n http://www.geo.umn.edu/mgs/\n \n You got a better explanation?\n \n \nNot just myself, but people collectively. People have a right to question why private pollution is bad, but government pollution is not a problem.\n\n \n Two wrongs make a right again.\n \n Not only that, but people are questioning gov't pollution.\n \n \nThey are a hint of plenty, because there is often NO DIFFERENCE between your posts and those of a rabid environmentalist. I did read through the \"global warming\" thread. It is amazing - you seemed like a different person there. In this thread, I can see no difference between your reasoning and the reasoning of a global warming alarmist.\n\n \n I think you must read every second word, and just fill in the blanks with inferences and whatever it is you want to hear.\n \n I've never been called a rabid environmentalist before, every I know would laugh out loud at that. If simply pointing out to someone with no knowledfe of the subject that hydrocarbon leaks are serious, have potentially far reaching affects, and need to be dealt with makes me a rabid environmentalist, then so be it. \n \n I consider it simple common sense, even self interest for the most part.\n \n \nBut you give them a FREE PASS on road salt? \n \n \n WHERE?\n \n Answer - in your head.\n \n From post #39 -\n \n \nI agree that all that road salt is bad for the environment.\n \n \n I simply compared levels of toxicity of salt and hydrocarbons, the rest is your imagination and twisted logic.\n \n \nOh no no no no no, I caught it, I just didn't say anything, I was being polite. :p So you're MORE LEARY of common sense and a free press, than most government agencies?? \n \n \n You obviously didn't catch it.\n \n Quit trying to put words in my mouth, you've been doing repeatedly and it's getting very tiresome. It's childish to say the least.\n \n \nIf I was running a filling station and wanted to be left alone, I probably would.\n\n \n As many on your side are so fond of saying - \"Don't let the door hit you on the way out, America love it or leave it.\"\n \n We both know there's no way in hell you'd voluntarily move to Mexico City, even if I bought you your very own gas station there.\n \n \nMy point is this ~ many people who work as an employee, on a tax withholding payroll, with benefits, vacation, sick days etc. can have a hard time understanding why a service they require (a roof on their house, a major repair on their car) requires them to pay 4 or 5 times their own hourly rate to a worker/workers who very well may be less skilled than they themselves are. They don't understand normal business operating expences, let alone operating expences involved in a government as large as the U.S. currently is. I've been reading your posts long enough to know you have a grasp of it, but your comment about 6 months to a year being plenty of time for a one or two man business to scare up six figures didn't indicate it.\n\n \n Do you get a lifetime to pay your traffic fines?\n \n These people faced a hard slog no doubt, but they had plenty of gov't assistance - loans, grants, etc... and I find it hard to believe that they weren't aware their tanks were leaking. They should have been planning on the refit.\n \n If you've got the experience you claim to have, you know darn well that they were aware of the leaking tanks - you don't just have profit disappear into the ground and not know it.\n \n Regardless, it's the cost of doing business. People make money, people lose money. I never enjoy watching someone lose their life savings or suffer, but it's a simple reality. Given your political and economic leanings, I would have thought you'd embrace the concept.\n \n \nMuch of the U.S. could be considered fanatical according to you. One of our founders said \"when the government fears the people, there is liberty. When the people fear the government, there is tyranny. \n \n \n No they couldn't. Most of the USA, at least I hope, wouldn't condone or at least \"understand\" killing the messenger when they didn't like the message.\n \n You can vote them out of office any time you like.\n \n \nHaven't had a chance to do that yet. Did some checking on salt though - it seems to be a REAL problem. I won't bother to link you - I'm sure you know about it.\n\n \n I do actually.\n \n Unlike you, I like to know a little something about a subject before I presume to form an opinion and speak about it.\n \n Waxy",

   "You know, Marc, salt contamination could be a very significant problem. I'll admit I haven't read this last page of the thread too closely, but if you could point out any study (if you haven't already) that shows the dangers of salt contamination in groundwater? Perhaps the risk isn't as significant because the salt is more easily degraded by natural means. \n\n \n Here are two reasonable looking ones.\n \n http://www.forester.net/sw_0107_environmental.html\n \n \nRoad salt, however, is a pollutant that received little attention in the Watershed Agreement. Aside from a partnership program in which New York City pays to construct salt and sand storage facilities in watershed towns, road salt is not specifically regulated in the Watershed Agreement. \n\n Could this be a sign of corruption? The insurance industry loves road salt.\n \n \n \n \n http://emml.mtu.edu/gem/community/publications/wellspring/deicingdebate.html\n \n \nDespite these known cases of road-salt contamination, MTU GEM staff were surprised by the extent to which the public and decision makers perceive road salt to be a major source of groundwater pollution. In our 1992 groundwater awareness survey of 170 county fair-goers, road salt was ranked as the most serious groundwater contaminant, ahead of the other choices: gasoline/oil, bacteria, pesticides, solvents, and nitrates. Similarly, the 105 respondents to our 1992 water resources needs assessment ranked road salt second only to gasoline/oil. \n\n \n \n \n \n Now on to oil: Iif an aquifer is contaminated with hydrocarbons (even a small amount), it may be rendered unfit for human consumption for decades.\n http://www.mst.dk/publica/projects/2001/87-7944-367-2.htm\n -A bit technical, but has some useful information.\n \n And if you're still skeptical as to just how far water can travel underground, you really should read more about aquifers. Take, for example, the Ogallala Aquifer:\n http://www.npwd.org/Ogallala.htm\n It's one of the largest continuous aquifers in the world, and provides water to much of the region it covers. It's already facing problems with depletion. Imagine if a groundwater supply this large were contaminated.\n\n \n I don't disregard this information, but I'd like for the general public to do the imagining. Almost all environmental decisions are political. It would be nice if they weren't, but we can't change it. They should be decided in a political way IMO.",

   "No argument here. \n\n \n So that means I won? :p \n \n \n \n \nUnreal. Those darn elites again. emoticon_mad :p \n \n Where's the guesswork? Benzene, toluence, etc... are PROVEN CARCINOGENS. Some of the most carcinogenic compounds we know of. \n\n \n The guesswork is in the AMOUNTS. How much is spilled, and how many proven carcinogens make it to our drinking glasses.\n \n \nAlcohol is a factor in many car accidents. It may not be the only factor, ie speed, road conditions, driver skill, a deer, etc... can all be factors in an accident in addition to alcohol.\n \n Does that mean then that we should just ignore alcohol as key factor? \n\n \n Apples & oranges. Drinking alcohol before driving is easily identified if a wreck happens. If someone gets cancer, it's more difficult to accuse private owners of old filling stations.\n \n \n \nLMAO. Yeah, that's exactly the subliminal message I was trying to get across. :p \n \n You're a real piece of work marc9000. :p \n \n Please do repost it \"in perfect order\". Should be good for a laugh, or at the least, some insight into how your mind works.\n \n By pointing out the childishness of your reasoning with an intentionally simple analogy, I somehow defined the gov't as the \"parent\" and the people as \"children\". \n \n ROFLMAO. Again, unreal. \n\n \n \nYou seem to be operating under the two wrongs make a right method.\n \n I don't really see how the evils of salt have anything to do with the evils of hydrocarbon.\n \n You scream blue murder about salt, then in the same breath criticize regulations on hydrocarbons. (Some might call this hypocritical.) \n \n The real kicker is, you justify your opposition to hydrocarbons by pointing out how poorly we're dealing with salt.\n \n Can you honestly not see the flaw in that reasoning? \n\n \n \n]No I can't. Most other government agencies have to consistently do their job. Police can't obviously fight crime on one side of the city, and let it go on the other side. Firemen can't let buildings burn on one side of the city only. The EPA should address pollution consistently, in keeping with political guidelines. When our fourth amendment says \"reasonable\", I don't think it means \"reasonable according to an unelected bureaucracy\".\n\n \n \nThen there's no point in continuing this debate. You reason at the level of a child. \"Well Jimmy gets to do it, so I should be able to do it too.\" \n\n \n Nothing subliminal at all, it's right there for all to see. Jimmy is insurance companies and municipalities and salt companies, and I'm an old filling station owner. And my parents the EPA tells me, \"We're your parents, and you'll do as we say. Some day you'll understand why Jimmy the rich one gets different treatment than you the poor one. Why should we let you do what Jimmy does? Two wrongs don't make a right you know.\"\n \n \n \n \n \nOhhh man, this just keeps getting better. :p \n \n ARE YOU KIDDING?\n \n You actually think you've won this debate? LOL. \n \n Maybe some readers would care to comment. :p \n\n \n Well, you gotta admit it was a good line. You led me right into it.\n \n There's seldom a winner in non-judged debates. We've each made our good points. You think you've made more good points than me, and I KNOW I've made more good points than you. :p \n \n \n \n \nDespite my favourite definition of insanity (stolen from Einstein), I may give it whirl.\n \n \n \n You're right, everyone in the USA that supports the EPA is an idiot with no knowledge of the subject. On top of that, the EPA is so powerful, that it maintains its conspiracy of lies and deceit over the entire population with ease.\n \n Only people such as yourself see through their evil conspiracy and truly understand and object. \n\n \n You may be more guilty than me of exaggerating oponents positions.\n \n \nLegitimate EPA actions (yes I think there are a few, \n",

We use 15 million tons per year today, as opposed to 10 million in 1983, and 2 million in the mid 60's. In the mid 60's, we didn't have many major roadways closed, economical hardships or public safety concerns. With increasing government, we've grown increasingly spoiled. There don't seem to be any plans to hold the line on 15 million tons/year. How long before it reaches 20 million, then 25 million, year in and year out? If a new discovery is made that it's more harmful than we thought, will we hear about it, or will the insurance lobby increase political contributions?\n \n \n \n Again, the key point here is the government is applying the salt with the approval of their constituents.

As long as the swarms aren't too obvious to too many people. It's the main reason EPA vehicles aren't marked. The main reason auto emission testing hasn't (yet) gone national.

   "Hello to another ol FTE guy - it's been awhile!\n \n \n\n \n Hello back at you! ;) \n \n Marc, you don't have to convince me that there are great inequalities of justice that occur in our government. I guess the other side of the coin is that despite how strongly we feel on an issue, we live in a society where the majority gets the last say. Something may not appear to be moral, logical, or prudent, but if 51% of Americans believe it (theoretically), it's probably going to become law. I agree with you that the EPA, like a lot of other government agencies, is inefficient, bloated, and has the propensity to outstretch its boundaries and infringe on individuals rights. I do, however, disagree that industry and the individual citizen are capable of regulating themselves when it comes to doing the right thing with respect to the environment. All we have to do is roll the clock back several years ago and witness all the cleanup efforts of our lakes, rivers, and neighborhoods from the many years of unregulated pollution that occurred before we started holding people accountable. Just travel outside the United States and you'll get all the proof you need. For an industrialized nation, I suppose there is always a fine line between too much, and too little. Too much regulation and we stifle industry, too little and we pay the price with health concerns. I guess it's like a swinging pendulum that has to settle somewhere in the middle.",

   "Well said Jskufan, but I think things would be different if 51% of todays Americans appreciated their freedom as much as 51% of Americans did in 1776.
