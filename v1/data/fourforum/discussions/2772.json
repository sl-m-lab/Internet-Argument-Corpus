   "I just wanted to reitterate what our administration was saying about a unified coalition, the twenty something supporters of this fight against terrorism or rather Saddam Hussein, or liberation... I mean wmds? Oh hell I don't know but in 50 years, we're all gonna be better off, I think, well if we all pray hard enough to god (not allah) things should be looking fine. So here's the break down \n \n Military Fatalities \n \n American 896 \n UK 61 \n All others 60 \n \n \n Now if that's not a unified coaltion I don't know what is. This is war... I mean occupation... XXXXXXn it I mean reconstruction involving the US. We are not bearing the majority of the cost and fatalities, I meant to say all, all the cost and fatalities... Where was I? The point is we are unified, together, cohesive, like... like a coaltion... a unified coaltion. That's what we are. Just look at the numbers for crying out loud. \n \n US deaths since Pres Bush announced the famous slogan, \"Bring Them On\"",

   "You do realize Britain is the only country that is in the coalition vountarily right?\n \n The rest were either bribed, blackmailed, extorted, or threatned. Coalition of the willing or coalition of the coerced? Hell, we even tried to bribe Turkey with millions of dollars. \n \n \nOh hell I don't know but in 50 years, we're all gonna be better off,\n\n \n And you say this why? \n \n \nI think, well if we all pray hard enough to god (not allah) things should be looking fine.\n\n \n So I see you are adamantly aganist Islam. Do you realize that the majority of Muslims want peace? \n \n \nNow if that's not a unified coaltion I don't know what is.\n\n \n How about a coalition that believes that all their interests are essentially the same and voluntarily sacrifice to achieve these? Not because they are being threatned with the withdraw of millions in military aid. \n \n Example: Is it a coalition if a thug says join me or die? \n \n \nWe are not bearing the majority of the cost and fatalities\n\n \n My country is certainly bearing the VAST majority of the economic costs, political costs, human costs, crediblity costs, and good will costs.",
