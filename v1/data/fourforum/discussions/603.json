   "There seems to be ALOT of misconceptions and misinterpretations of Islam from the West (and Muslims themselves of course!) to the extent that terrorism has become synonymous with the religion! In my opinion this is corrupting the beautiful messages and philosophies that Islam has to offer to their believers. One thing that non-Muslims (or those questioning Islamic motives) should keep in mind is that there is a fine line between fundamentalism and orthodoxy (can't find the correct word, referring to 'normal' or 'simple' Muslims). The two shouldn't be confused. \n \n As a Muslim myself, I hate to see the west having such hostile views towards ALL Muslims and the common stereotype Muslim = Terrorist. I totally condemn these fools especially bulls*** Taliban philosophy and those behind 9/11. \n \n Speaking of which. Another thing Americans have to keep in mind. Us Arabs, especially those from the Mashreq, that is, the nations stretching from Egypt to Iraq, have suffered a GREAT DEAL in the 20th century whether internal problems such as coup d'etats or Israel. That is why, upon mentioning 9/11 to an Palestinian, he/she might reply, \"Oh, that's nothing compared to what we've experience for over 50 years!\" \n \n I'm not saying this is good, or bad. What I'm trying to do is to help you understand our psychology. Newsweek magazine (in late 2001) printed an issue with the cover reading: \"Why do they hate us?\" \n \n For God's sake 'we' don't hate 'you'!!!!! Hussein Hajj Hassan, a Hezballah member was on Lebanese TV the other night in an interesting debate with none other than............DANIEL PIPES ;) \n and he specifically told Dr. Pipes, \"I have ABSOLUTELY NO HATRED TOWARDS AMERICAN CITIZENS, they are most welcome to visit our beautiful country. The issue is, we are totally against your foreign policies namely your BLIND support for the zionist state of Israel!\" \n \n It's stories such as the American who attacked a guy wearing a turban? Turns out he was a Sikh from India. Upon his arrest, they explained to him, \"He's not an Arab, he's from India\", he replies \"Aaah, close enough!\"\n \n sad",

A small, and by small I mean Small, percentage of Americans do think that way, but mainly due to either lack of knowledge on the subject, poor raising by the parents, or just plain stupidity. I know of no one who has hostile views of Muslims, and definitaly don't know of anyone who would beat up a man wearing a turban.\n \n I wish I had read that issue of Newsweek. I'm GUESSING that by saying \"Why do they hate us?\", they are refering to the Al Quieda (spl?) and why they hate Americans, since the issue was just after the Sept. 11 attacks.

Do Muslims acknowledge this problem within their religion? NO. They use techniques such as denial, or misdirection (What about the Inquistion?) or projection (It's the Jews!), all the time the situation within Islam, it's memebers and the countries that DEMAND it's practice worsens. Non Muslims in the west, and really the whole world, grow SO tired of having a Western Muslim say that his or her faith is being misrepresented, only to have that person lay blame on the Jews, or point out something in ancient history like the Inquistion. Enough is enough already, we aren't buying it. Islam MUST recoginze it's internal (and eternal) problemS and then fix them. If not, it will be fixed by an outside source.

When a KKK memeber kills a black man, there is ZERO backing he can get from the Bible. It's not a Christian doctrine. But when a Muslim kills a non Muslim, it IS an Islamic doctrine. It's ok to do that. Muhammad himself pardoned followers that killed non Muslims. And the sad thing is, there's a HUGE difference between vocalizing something, and then acting on it. Being a Muslim and pointing out that Islamic Terrorists are Extremeists doesn't bring back the World Trade Centers. It doesn't bring back the child with bombs strapped to them.

However, one they are on a small scale. Christians don't bring down Trade Centers or strap bombs to their children. Their will be crazy people in all faiths, so this is a moot point. Islamic terrorism is one that is organized and world wide. It is the one faith that has the characteristics. It also effects the WORLD. I couldn't care less if you all kill each inside your borders, you do so anyways. But when it effects the rest of the world's population, it's a problem.\n \n +++\"But don't spit on us and say it's raining\"\n \n - Please elaborate on that. I understand for them not to \"spit on us\" but \"say its raining\" I don't think relates to the situation at hand.+++\n \n What I mean by this is Muslims say, \"Everything is A OK.\" All the while buildings blow up, children blow themselves up, demonstrations are inacted to \"Kill Westerns and Christians\", heads are turned in ignorance. Do you see? Everything is NOT A OK. Yet Muslims walk around like it is. And when it is brought up, it's the Christians or the Jews.

   "SilentPoet, it would seem that we need to clear up some more of your own misconceptions.\n \n \n- I think you are referring to the crusades. I feel it crucial to remind you that probably around just as much bloodshed was enacted by Christianity, during the crusades.\n\n \n First, do some history research, please. \n \n I cannot control what another Christian does. Mr. Urban II may have thought he was helping Jesus out, but he was far from it. A quote from Christian historian John Woodbridge from Lee Strobel's book The Case for Faith \"[the Crusades] made a mockery of the teachings of the Bible and can't in any way be squared with historic Christian beliefs.\" \n \n \nChristianity must be pretty far up on a list of most violent religions.

Most Christians would call such groups as these as not real Christians. Because they are secular groups. This is also what Islam calls their own extremists. \n\n \n First off, I would like to say that the KKK and Neo-Nazi's are a bunch of XXXXXX who use Christianity as a background so they can gather more support. Second, there's a major difference between so-called \"Christian\" cults and Islamic cults. These terrorists are doing what the Koran says to do. They are taking it to the extreme (why they're called extremists) by wanting to kill every single person who doesn't believe in Islam, but where did it come from? These terrorists didn't decide to add to the Koran. The Koran does say to kill those who don't agree with you. Google it, you'll find verses upon verses out of the Koran stating things like that. The Bible says nothing about going out and killing people who aren't of the same ethnic group or about controlling others and killing them if they don't agree with you. \n \n \nHow is this any diffrent?\n Rudolph was a Christian terrorist, Just as the plane jackers were Muslim terrorists. \n \n\n \n It's very different. Rudolph may call himself whatever he wants, but he will not find ANYTHING in the Bible to justify what he did. Therefore, he is NOT acting upon Christian beliefs. Children attending Christian schools will not be taught that he was a 'matyr' who will go to Heaven and be with 72 virgins forever and ever. Neighborhoods with the majority of people being Christians did not throw parties at the news of those bombings. There's a big difference here, the question is, are you willing to accept it? \n \n \nMust I also point out how many indivisual crimes are commited in the name of Christianity. \n (Indivisual killings... such as the woman who drowned her children in the bath tub)\n She did that to \"protect them from Satan\". Of course the woman was obviously insane, but there are alot more cases like hers that kill in the name of Christianity. \n \n\n \n You really have a one-sided view. Many people can come up with crimes done in the name of Allah, or of Islam. People can name crimes done in the names of Greek mythological gods. Guess what, people can even name crimes done in the name of evolution. \n \n \nAlso just for a note Christianity will use alot of the same tactics as well alot of other religions to brainwash their members and excuse their violence.\n\n \n Let's rephrase that so it's not so one-sided. \n \n \"Also just for a note evolutionists will use alot of the same tactics as well alot of other religions (humanists) to brainwash their (it's) members (supporters) and excuse their violence.",

One example is a racist group known as the Christian Seperatist Group. They claim that Jesus was a \"White Man\" i.e. a Gentile and run their theology off that idea. They have there own translation of the Bible as well, the Anointed Scriptures. (If memory serves me well.) The problem is, there's nothing to back up their claims, and to keep their claims they've had to falsify the Bible to fit it into their little doctrines. Islam doesn't do this though. Another problem is that the Koran isn't a sole authority, like the Bible is to Christendom. Hadiths are up there, and in fact, even the Biography of Muhammad is used in some groups as yet another \"authority\". The other issue is this, Muhammad was by no means a saint. A group often look no further then the actions of it's leader. Muhammad was a thief, a war monger, a womanizer, dare I mention his 9 year old wife, and a politicaly leader. If Muhammad killed, I can kill. If Muhammad stole, I can steal. If Muhammad marries a 9 year old...well, you get the idea.

It matters not though, the Koran says the Jews and Christians are in agreement to go after Muslims. This is Islam at work for you.\n \n +++- More so in Christianity than in greek mythology and evolution (please name 3 crimes commited in the name of evolution). You are restating my point and therfor I agree with you.+++\n \n I will state this fact, with Russia and China, two atheistic governments, they succeeded in reducing the Earth's population by over 1 billion people. If you think athieism is a viable alternative, look at Russia and China. Russia is an economic nightmare and is guility of human rights violations, and China is even worse! This is athieism dirty secret. When mankind becomes his own standard, his true nature is revealed. And it ain't pretty.\n \n +++ Tell me Habbit... How many humanist churches or meeting places are there. Tell me how many private schools are there for atheists? Tell me how many evolution beleiving parents grow up sending their children as an inphant to special classes or orginzations to endorse there beleifs and therfor brainwash the child?+++\n \n Several actually. One, public institutes for learning. Government buildings. There's humanism right there. Atheists don't need private schools, they have public schools. And again, public schools teach evolution, despite the fact it is an unproven theory, and despite the fact that they will not teach another way. So, who is being brain washed again? Let's have no pity party for athieism.\n \n +++But of course just about every religion uses brianwashing tactics. More so I beleive in Christianity and Islam than any other religion. There is some brainwashing in judiasm but not as much. They are taught to question god.+++\n \n Sadly, this whole \"brainwashing\" thing isn't a good foundation to stand on, though it's the most common one among athiests. It's the athiests that are screaming at the very, very top of their lungs to remove all alternatives to their theories. Evolution is one. Faith is another. This is brainwashing. Athieism is not free of it by a long shot. And it's less then 200 year track record in all aspects of life is utterly deplorable. I ask all athiests to do this, instead of looking at others, first look at yourself. \n \n Thanks for reading this, take care,\n \n Suede",

Apparently many of them didn't realize that it isn't quote of the Constitution and they get all excited and point it out with glee. Of course, you are probably aware the the phrase comes from Thomas Jefferson in his Letter to the Danbury Baptists. In Jefferson's words, the two religion clauses of the 1st Amendment build \"...a wall of separation between church and state.\" One might be inclined to believe that Jefferson was aware of the intent of the Congress when they wrote the 1st Amendment, since he was so close to one of the driving forces, James Madison.\n \n But you are correct that it says that \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\" Apparently the 1st Congress considered this important, since these clauses are the first two of the Bill of Rights. But obviously, we must look elsewhere to apply these clauses to the states (and therefore counties, cities and towns, and even school districts - all divisions of the state).\n \n But first, I should mention another truth about the Constitution. The sole power to interpret the meaning of the Constitution rests with the Surpeme Court. That is the job of the Supreme Court, nothing more. Any and all matters brought before the Supreme Court are questions of interpretation of the Constitution. So it is the Supreme Court that decides when one article or clause of the Constitution is applicable to another.\n \n So let me quote from lexisnexis review of Constitutional Law.\n \nBoth the Establishment and the Free Exercise Clauses by their terms only restrict legislative action by Congress. However, both clauses have been interpreted to apply also to the states, by means of the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause.\n\n The legalese, the religious freedom clauses of the 1st Amendment have been incorporated against the states by the 14th Amendment. In fact, most of the Bill of Rights have been incorporated at one time or another, with the significant exception of the 2nd Amendment. That's why cities and states can make it illegal to cary firearms.\n \n But I digress. At any rate, you can see that the religious freedoms guaranteed by the 1st Amentment also apply against the states. Justice Black even quoted Jefferson in a church-state decision in which the religious liberty clauses were incorporated under the 14th Amendment in 1947.",

   "Gilligan,\n \n Though I usually don't entertain athiests anymore, I will counter your post because you call yourself a liberal athiests and seem open to listen to counter points. I have good faith you'll consider them.\n \n +++Genesis\n \n \"God drowns everything that breathes air. From newborn babies to koala bears -- all creatures great and small, the Lord God drowned them all.\" 7:21-23\n \n \"God tells Abram to kill some animals for him. The needless slaughter makes God feel better.\" 15:9-10+++\n \n The two statements are emotional arguements. They find their power in moving you, or hitting your emotions. Emotionalism is a tough one though, because it is biased and subjective. What makes one sad may make another glad. \n The world had become wicked, this is why God flooded the earth. I LOVE the inclusion of newborn babies and koala bears though. Really pulls on the heart strings. Guess what, puppies and kittens died too. Needless slaughter? No, an animal's life is in it's blood. Sacrifice was for atonement of a person's sin, not to make God feel better. But cute touch. \n \n +++Leviticus\n \n \"Homosexuals must be executed.\" 20:13+++\n \n Another emotional arguement here. Sadly now days, people think homosexuals are men with good fashion sense and a snappy wit. Too much Will & Grace I must say. They never mention the negatives though. \n \n +++Deuteronomy\n \n \"Kill everyone who has religious beliefs that are different from your own.\" 17:2-7+++\n \n Not exactly. This law applied to people living in the land of the Hebrews. Second, for one of them to be executed for false worship, it required three witnesses. Third, one of those witnesses was to seal his confession by being the first to strike the guilty party. This wasn't to run amok and kill everyone and anyone. Again though, the laws that regulate this law are left off. Of course. \n \n +++1 Samuel\n \n \"\"The Lord killeth ...\" -- every chance he gets.\" 2:6, 2:25+++\n \n Cut and pasting two seperate verses. This is all to typical. 2:6 is \"The lord brings death AND makes alive. He brings down to the grave and raises up.\" A bit different when the whole verse is listed. 2:25 is the same. It is dealing with wickedness of some of the sons of Israel and is not connected with verse 6. \n \n +++Matthew\n \n \"Jesus sends some devils into a herd of pigs, causing them to run off a cliff and drown in the waters below.\" 8:32+++\n \n Emotionalism yet again. First off, this is the story of a demon possessed man. Personally I place humans above animals, but maybe I'm wrong. Secondly, it was the DEMONS request to be sent into the pigs, as we can read in there verse right before verse 32. 31-The demons begged Jesus, \"If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs.\" \n \n +++\"Jesus condemns entire cities to dreadful deaths and to the eternal torment of hell because they didn't care for his preaching.\" 11:20-24+++\n \n Actually it was because they did not repent. We need note the city of Ninevah, found in the Book of Jonah. It too was wicked and was to be destroyed by God, BUT, they repented and were spared. \n \n +++Mark\n \n \"Jesus tells us to cut off our hands and feet, and pluck out our eyes to avoid going to hell.\" 9:43-49+++\n \n Jesus is showing just how serious sin is. Plucking your eyes out or being limbless doesn't get you into heaven. Jesus states that if these cause you to stumble, you should get rid of them. Again, this discourse is dealing with the seriousness of sin.\n \n +++\"Jesus says that God is like a slave-owner who beats his slaves \"with many stripes.\"\" 12:46-47+++\n \n First this is the book of Luke, not Mark, but moving on. Jesus is not saying that God is a slave owner that beats slaves. First, Jesus is speaking in a parable, not in a literal sense. Here's what Jesus means. Jesus is stating that if you are aware of a law, and break it anyways, you are much more guilty then someone who breaks the law and wasn't aware of it. This is summed up in verse 48, conviently, but expectedly, left off. \n \n +++and i could go on, and on, and on, and on...+++\n \n No need, as we can see by this small sampling of both the OT and the NT, the emotionalism, the cutting and pasting, the leaving off of verses that explain previous verses, etc...All in all, typical. \n Well, take no offense Gilligan. I'm hoping you will honestly consider what has been noted here, and understand the manipulation and blinding that athiests will do to remain in hate. Take care,\n \n SUEDE\n ;)",
