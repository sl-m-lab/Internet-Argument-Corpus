   "The article accuses him of nepotism. Where does it say that Annan had anything to do with OFF? Or are you just assuming guilt and worrying about finding the evidence later?\nThis particular article only questions his honesty and ethics. There are other things that have pointed toward his guilt in the actual manipulation of things related to the OFF scandal.\n \n Here's an example:\n \n http://www.heritage.org/Research/InternationalOrganizations/wm589.cfm\n \n Annan and Oil for Food\n \n In an extraordinary intervention, Kofi Annan attacked the conclusions contained in the Iraq Survey Group Report (the Duelfer Report)[2] regarding Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction program. Annan firmly rejected accusations in the report that Saddam attempted to bribe members of the U.N. Security Council through the Oil-for-Food program:\n \n \n \n I don't think the Russian or the French or the Chinese government would allow itself to be bought because some of his companies are getting relative contracts of the Iraqi authorities. I don't believe that at all. I think it's inconceivable, these are very serious and important governments. You are not dealing with banana republics.[3]\n \n \n \n These remarks on the Duelfer Report are breathtaking in their arrogance and are a blatant demonstration of the Secretary General's bias in favor of those nations that had opposed the removal of Saddam Hussein from power.\n \n \n \n Annan's comments are all the more remarkable for the fact that they were made against the backdrop of the biggest scandal in U.N. history, the ill-fated Oil-for-Food program, now the subject of at least four congressional investigations, three U.S. federal investigations, as well as a U.N.-appointed commission of inquiry, the Volcker Commission.[4] In a recent development, the U.S. Department of Justice is investigating the role of Kojo Annan, Kofi's son, in connection to his role as a paid consultant to Cotecna Inspection SA, a Swiss-based company that received a contract for inspecting goods shipped to Iraq under the Oil-for-Food program.[5]\n \n \n \n As the U.N. faces its greatest ever crisis, with its reputation firmly on the line, it is in the interests of the world body that Kofi Annan stand down while investigations into the U.N.'s management of the Oil-for-Food program proceed. The allegations against the U.N. are of such a serious nature that it is inappropriate for the organization's CEO to remain in place when his own credibility is in question.\n \n Several key questions remain regarding Kofi Annan:\n \n Did the U.N. Secretary-General deliberately turn a blind eye to U.N. mismanagement and corruption in overseeing the Oil-for-Food program?\n Did he sympathize with the efforts of Saddam Hussein and key members of the Security Council to lift U.N. sanctions against Iraq?\n Were efforts made by the Hussein regime to influence the actions and decisions of the Secretary-General with regard to Iraq?\n Was Annan influenced in his decision-making regarding the program by his son's involvement with Cotecna?\n The refusal of the U.N. to hand over to congressional investigators the audits into Oil for Food produced by the U.N.'s Office of Internal Oversight suggests that their contents may be damaging to the reputation of Annan and the U.N. Secretariat.",
