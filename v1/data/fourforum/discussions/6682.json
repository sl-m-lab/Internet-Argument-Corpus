   "I was listening to a programme called Point of View on BBC Radio 4. In this programme Harold Evans was talking about the Iraq War and the attempt at building Democracy in that Country. \n \n During the course of the programme he compared Bush to Wilson, both men where devout Christians and both men supported a doctrine of American Intervention.\n \n Here is the transcript of the programme.\n http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/views/a_point_of_view/\n \n I honestly do not know much about Wilson, so do you guys think it is a valid comparison ? Also what do you guys think of the article in General ?",

Bush's is public, designed to cater to a specific voting bloc.\n\n \n It wasn't personal--one can't read much on Wilson and not know he was devout. He was presbyterian and a staunch calvinist. I suspect that Wilson's political enemies said some of the same things about Wilson then that you are saying about him and his religion now.\n \n The problem isn't that Wilson was any less public about his religion than Bush, but that we're a lot more secular of a society now than then. People didn't mind at all for a president to be religious back then--they might have viewed it as a good thing. There was no us-vs-them mentality even among secularists; they wouldn't use political terms like the \"religious right\" even though from an ideological standpoint, most religious people WERE like the religious right back then. I think you are wrong to think that Bush's faith is only to cater to a voting block; I think his faith is very real to him. If Bush's faith were only to cater to a religious voting block, he'd have withdrawn the Miers SCOTUS nomination.\n \n There is at least one HUGE difference between these men--Wilson was big on international cooperation and uniting nations around the world. He almost did it with the League of Nations, which was his brainchild. Bush, in contrast, is quite comfortable having the U.S. chart their own course.",

   "If Billybubba is smart, then I've got a nice patch of swampland I'd like to sell ya.\n\n Oh? Did BushyBoy get a Rhodes Scholarship, too?\n \n \nThe Rhodes Scholarships were established in 1903 by Cecil Rhodes, who dreamed of improving the world through the diffusion of leaders motivated to serve their contemporaries, trained in the contemplative life of the mind, and broadened by their acquaintance with one another and by their exposure to cultures different from their own. Mr. Rhodes hoped that his plan of bringing able students from throughout the English-speaking world and beyond to study at Oxford University would aid in the promotion of international understanding and peace. Each year, 32 U. S. citizens are among more than 90 Rhodes Scholars worldwide who take up degree courses at Oxford University.\n \n Mr. Rhodes' Will contains four criteria by which prospective Rhodes Scholars are to be selected:\n \n 1. literary and scholastic attainments; \n \n 2. energy to use one's talents to the full, as exemplified by fondness for and success in sports; \n \n 3. truth, courage, devotion to duty, sympathy for and protection of the weak, kindliness, unselfishness and fellowship; \n \n 4. moral force of character and instincts to lead, and to take an interest in one's fellow beings. \n \n The American Secretary of the Rhodes Trust administers all aspects of the Rhodes Scholarships in the United States. On behalf of the Rhodes Trustees in England, he determines the rules and procedures of the competition, advises colleges and universities, selects all selection committee members, interprets Trust policies and selection criteria for Americans, and advises Rhodes Scholars-elect. The current American Secretary is Elliot F. Gerson. The Rhodes Trustees have designated officers in other countries with Rhodes Scholarships who have similar responsibilities.\n\n \n http://www.rhodesscholar.org/\n \n From the biography of Bill Clinton:\n \nHe excelled as a student and as a saxophone player and once considered becoming a professional musician. As a delegate to Boys Nation while in high school, he met President John Kennedy in the White House Rose Garden. The encounter led him to enter a life of public service. \n \n Clinton was graduated from Georgetown University and in 1968 won a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford University.\n\n \n http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/presidents/bc42.html\n \n Now, Bassman, I suppose that you are extremely angry, because of your elitist views, at Clinton's American success story--the fact that he came from a poor family in Arkansas but was able to, because of his intelligence and excellence as a scholar to get a Rhodes Scholarship, to go to Yale University based on his excellence and qualifications, not because he had a rich and powerful daddy who had also gone to Yale so that he could slump through university as a low-grade C student. I just know it riles you no end that the someone who did not belong to the rich elite succeeded.\n \n Obviously, to you success is inherited from a rich and powerful daddy who has rich and powerful friends to help a failure look like he is successful, not earned.",
