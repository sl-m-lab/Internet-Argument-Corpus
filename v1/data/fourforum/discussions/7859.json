   "Two hours ago, aliens landed in a small corn field in Iowa. Two of the aliens came out of the ship and start to study the locals. Landing in a corn field in Iowa, they believe that the corn is the predominate life form on Earth. When the corn doesn't respond to them, they conclude that there is no intelligent life on Earth what so ever. They decide to go back into their ship before they waste anymore time when a guy in a black suit rolls up and takes down one of them while the other alien escapes into his ship and leaves behind the other alien who was taken to a secret lab where they do...what ever it is that they do to aliens in secret labs. People, I'm telling you this for three reasons...\n 1. Scientest are looking into this new found interest the aliens have in corn.\n 2. The U.S. Government, as always in this kind of situation, is hiding the truth.\n and as for number 3...\n \n \n \n \n 3.It's April Fools Day!emoticon_xgood\n \n \n \n Please note that everything said above was just for humor and none of it is true...to my knowldge.",

   "lol, I don't know if they did anything today (I had SAT's this morning and a baseball game this afternoon), but I know last year the paper (the washington post) did a story on dinosaurs and a theory that they had a writing system. They showed a picture and said to put it up to the mirror to see what it said. I was really curious but smacked myself when I read it in the mirror. Very clear, in reverse letters, were the words \"April Fools\". lol. The best part was some people hadn't taken the time to look at the picture in the mirror and came to school believing it was true. One teacher was actually telling us about it :)",

The conclusion was to have the principal conviently in the class room as the teacher told us that due to bad schedualling, if we were going to be able to go on to middle school, we were going to have to start staying late until like 3:30 or 4:00 (usually we got out at 3:10). This was anounced right after we came in from the Recess after lunch (so about 12:30 or so.) Then right before 3:10 as we were about to leave, the teacher got out the not that we were supposed to give to our parents and after reading the \"Dear Parents, we need to inform you of...\" (or whatever she said) she finished with a big \"APRIL FOOLS!\" That was probibly the meanest April Fools joke.",
