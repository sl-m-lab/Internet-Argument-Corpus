   "GOP rams anti-union bill through Wis. Senate \n \n \n GOP rams anti-union bill through Wis. Senate - Politics - More politics - msnbc.com\n \n \n MADISON, Wis. - Republicans pushed a provision stripping public employees of their collective bargaining rights through the state Senate Wednesday evening after finding a way to bypass the chamber's missing Democrats.\n \n Republican senators separated the provision from Gov. Scott Walker's controversial budget bill, removing the requirement that 20 senators be present for a vote on the anti-union measure.\n \n The vote in the Senate was 18-1. Sen. Dale Schultz was the sole no vote. No Democrats were present.\n \n Spectators in the gallery screamed at the Republicans on the floor, \"You are cowards.\"\n \n All 14 Democrats had left the state for Illinois nearly three weeks ago to prevent passage of the overall budget bill, because it contained the anti-union measure. \n \n The Senate is split 19-14 with Republicans in the majority. Because the union provision was part of a budget bill, Republicans in the Senate needed at least 20 senators present for a quorum.\n \n By separating out the anti-union measure, Republicans did not need 20 senators to allow a vote on that piece.\n \n \"In 30 minutes, 18 state senators undid 50 years of civil rights in Wisconsin,\" Democratic Sen. Mark Miller said in a statement. \"Their disrespect for the people of Wisconsin and their rights is an outrage that will never be forgotten.\"\n \n Democratic Sen. Jon Erpenbach said on msnbc cable TV's \"The Rachel Maddow Show\" that the Democrats would not return to the state yet, fearing the action was a GOP trick. Other members, appearing on \"The Ed Show,\" reiterated that position.\n \n Walker said in a statement: \"The Senate Democrats have had three weeks to debate this bill and were offered repeated opportunities to come home, which they refused. In order to move the state forward, I applaud the Legislature's action today to stand up to the status quo and take a step in the right direction to balance the budget and reform government.\"\n \n Before the Senate floor vote, Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald read the bill to a hastily created joint conference committee. The lone Democrat on the panel, Rep. Peter Barca, D-Kenosha, objected, saying the meeting was in violation of the state's open meetings law. But over Barca's strenuous objections, Fitzgerald went ahead with the vote, which was seen live on the WisconsinEye public affairs cable network, and the measure was approved.\n Video: Wisconsin GOP pushes through anti-union bill (on this page)\n \n Senate Democrats reportedly were meeting to decide how to respond. Some argue that Senate Republicans were violating legislative rules with the vote.\n \n Barca, the Assembly minority leader, said later that he would seek action by the state attorney general, a Republican.\n \n The stand-alone measure now would have to be approved by the Assembly, the lower chamber. The Assembly was not in session Wednesday. Assembly Majority Leader Scott Suder says the chamber would be in session at 11 a.m. Thursday.\n \n The measure approved Wednesday forbids most government workers from collectively bargaining for wage increases beyond the rate of inflation. It also requires public workers to pay more toward their pensions and double their health insurance contribution, a combination equivalent to an 8 percent pay cut for the average worker.\n \n Police and firefighters are exempt.\n \n The battle over union rights has galvanized protesters in Wisconsin. Up to 70,000 people at a time have rallied in Madison against the measures, and protesters have occupied the Capitol Rotunda, prompting a legal battle over their right to do so.\n \n About 2,000 protesters remained in the building after police repeatedly announced the building was closed and they needed to leave.\n \n \"The whole world is watching!\" they shouted as they pressed up against the entrance to the Senate chamber, which was heavily guarded by state patrol officers.\n \n Stripping out the collective-bargaining provisions into a \"non-fiscal\" bill raises questions about the governor's and the Republicans' argument that the issue of collective bargaining rights is crucial to the budget.\n \n The drama unfolded less than four hours after Walker met with GOP senators in a closed-door meeting. He emerged from the meeting saying senators were \"firm\" in their support of the bill.\n \n For weeks, Democrats had offered concessions on issues other than the bargaining rights and they spent much of Wednesday again calling on Walker and Republicans to compromise.\n \n Fitzgerald said earlier that Republicans had been discussing concessions offered by Walker, including allowing public workers to bargain over their salaries without a wage limit. Several GOP senators facing recall efforts had also publicly called for a compromise.\n \n \n \"The people of Wisconsin elected us to come to Madison and do a job,\" Fitzgerald said in a statement after the vote. \"Just because the Senate Democrats won't do theirs, doesn't mean we won't do ours.\"\n \n Union leaders weren't happy with Walker's offer, and were furious at the Senate's move to push the measure forward with a quick vote. Phil Neuenfeldt, president of the Wisconsin state AFL-CIO, said after Wednesday's vote that Republicans exercised a \"nuclear option.\"\n \n \"Scott Walker and the Republicans' ideological war on the middle class and working families is now indisputable,\" Neuenfeldt said.\n \n NBC News' Mike Taibbi, John Yang, Mark Murray, Samira Puskar and Stephanie Himango, and msnbc.com staff contributed to this report, which includes information from The Associated Press.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n So there you have it folks.... Welcome to the GOP majority and the sellout by walker to the Koch brothers. This isn't just outrageous and horrific in the terms of workers rights, it's dirty, underhanded and the MO for the Republican Party....",

   "So now WI public employees can't strike and can't unionize.\n \n Why should they be second-class citizens?\n\n \n Yes, they can unionize. They can even strike. They just have no strike protection. The state can fire employees who strike. As it should be (it should be the same in the private sector). \n \n Public sector unions are not like private sector unions. From an economic standpoint, private sector unions bargain for wages from limited profits. Competition moderates wage demands. In the public sector you dont have this...the union negotiates for tax dollars, with no competition to moderate wage demands...the sky is the limit.\n \n The next difference comes in who they negotiate with. In the private sector, union negotiation is an adversarial process. On one side the the table you have the union reps working to get their people as much as they reasonably can. On the other side of the table you have management working diligently to keep costs down.\n \n There is no such adversarial process in public sector unions. In the majority of public sector union negotiations you have the union reps on one side of the table. On the other side of the table you have management, who are also members of the union. They negotiate (in good faith I am sure) their own salaries with representatives of their own unions.\n \n Once that is done, the \"management\" essentially goes to the brass, in this case elected representatives, and tells them what they have negotiated with their own union. \n \n This is where things get real sticky and why unions should be prohibited from giving money to political campaigns. Unions typically favor democratic representatives, but unless they are SURE the democrat is going to win a particular race, they also give generously to the republican candidate. That is a dirty little secret the republicans would rather you did not know...they take the union money, too. \n \n So the union \"negotiates\" with a manager, who is also a member of the union. Then the manager goes to the elected representative who, regardless of party, has received tens of thousands of dollars from the union, and is asked to approve the deal. \n \n Anywhere but the government EVERYBODY involved in that would end up in a federal prison because the conflicts of interest are waist deep.",

   "Yes, it seems that conservative Republicans never tire of trying to disempower the working-class populace of our society, so as to place the nation even more under the control of the economic elite of course. If they keep at it with the dogmatic tenacity they've demonstrated thus far, then perhaps one day the corporatocracy will even be able to come out in the open and officially abolish the facade of representative government.\n \n emoticon_xbouncer",
