   "What should we do about North Korea and its leader, Kim Jong Il? North Korea has the fourth largest army in the world. North Korea has admitted to restarting its nuclear weapons program and may already have a few nuclear missiles. It also has chemical and biological weapons. North Korea was behind terrorist attacks in the 1980's such as bombing of a Korean Airlines jet which resulted in the deaths of 115 people. \n \n Kim Jong Il is an evil dictator. In recent years, millions have starved to death in North Korea. Despite this, Kim Jong Il lives a life of luxury. He spends $650,000- $720,000 a year on cognac, a type of brandy distilled from white wine. The average North Korean only earns $900 a year. Kim Jong Il is also famous for his pleasure team. His pleasure team consists of young girls who have the responsibility to entertain Kim Jong Il and satisfy his fantasies. In the past, North Korea has kidnapped young girls from other countries so that they can join the pleasure team. It is estimated that there are also about 200,000 people in Kim Jong Il's prison camps. In these camps they beat, torture, and execute prisoners. Prisoners are used as guinea pigs to test biological and chemical weapons. Here are some quotations from my sources.\n \n \"Entire families, including grandchildren, are incarcerated for even the most bland political statements. Forced abortions are carried out on pregnant women so that another generation of political dissidents will be 'eradicated.' Inmates are used as human guinea pigs for testing biological and chemical agents, according to both former inmates and U.S. officials....'And then, from time to time there a living infant is delivered. And then if someone delivers a live infant, then the guards kick the bloody baby and kill it. And I saw an infant who was crying with pain. I have to express this in words, that I witnessed such an inhumane hell.' \"\n http://www.msnbc.com/news/859191.asp?0cl=cR#BODY\n \n \"The confrontation started three months ago when the United States said North Korea admitted it was pursuing nuclear weapons in violation of a 1994 agreement...As unquestioned leader, Kim has lived a life of comfort and excess as his people boiled grass for food. More than 2 million North Koreans are believed to have died of famine from 1994 to 1997. Even now, 70% of the country's children are malnourished, says the Korean Welfare Foundation, a private aid group in Seoul.\"\n http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2003-01-14-kim-cover-usat_x.htm\n \n \"As head of North Korea's special forces for much of the 70s and 80s, he has been linked by defectors to international terrorist activities, including the 1986 bombing of a Korean Airlines jet in which 115 people died.\"\n http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/1907197.stm\n \n \"But what else do we know about this man who may already have two nuclear bombs and controls the fourth largest military in the world -- one million heavily armed forces only miles away from nearly 40,000 U.S. troops in South Korea? ...Dr. Post, in his study of the Korean dictator, says Kim Jong Il also loves to drink a certain Hennessey cognac that sells for $630 a bottle in Korea. 'He is the largest customer over the last 10 years, averaging between $650,000 and $720,000 a year in purchases -- while the average [North] Korean earns only about $900 a year.'...There are other strange details about this man, according to Dr. Post. 'He's recruited these 'joy brigades,' where he finds these attractive young women as early as junior high to entertain senior officials.' Kim Jong Il also lives in a seven-story 'pleasure palace,' Post says, 'and sees himself as a great creative force.' \"\n http://edition.cnn.com/2003/US/01/08/wbr.kim.jong.il/\n \n \"Kim has shown a willingness to support terror in the past. He is credited with ordering the 1983 bombing of a South Korean delegation in Burma and the 1987 bombing of a South Korean airplane over the Andaman Sea, killing 115. Kim's secret agents have kidnapped at least a hundred Japanese and South Koreans over the years, including, to indulge Kim's cinema fancy, a prominent South Korean movie director.\"\n http://www.msnbc.com/news/855119.asp#BODY\n \n \"North Korea has a stockpile of 2,500 to 5,000 tons of chemical weapons and is believed to be capable of producing 1 ton of biological weapons annually, South Korea's Defense Ministry said yesterday...Pyongyang's army also has biological weapons involving 13 different lethal germs and viruses, the ministry said.\"\n http://www.washtimes.com/world/20020917-84317288.htm\n \n \"In order to please Kim Jong Il and his close associates, North Korea maintains a group of pleasure women, called the pleasure team at each specially prepared villa. The existence of the team was revealed to the outside world in the 1980s, when North Korea abducted a number of young women from Hong Kong, Maccao and Middle East countries in order to reinforce the pleasure team. The pleasure team is again broken down into a 'satisfaction team,' which performs the duty of providing sexual pleasure, a 'happiness team,' which conducts a massage service, and a 'dancing team,' which conducts and singing and dancing performances.\"\n http://www.fortunecity.com/meltingpot/champion/65/pers_cult.htm",

They stand no chance, Kim loses everything.\n\n \n I agree to a point that North Korea won't start a war themselves but they may force the US and UN to do so if they keep up what they are doing.\n \n Also my guess is that Kim is so used to getting what he wants that he has lost his perception of reality. Who in their right mind would threaten the United States with nuclear war day and and day out for months and months? They have to know the US doesn't negotiate so well with terror threats like this so they will not get anything. So in my view they already stand no chance and Kim is risking losing everything so why does he persist?\n \n He is either too proud to back down now or he is stupid enough to believe he can force the US into doing whatever he wants as he has nuclear weapons. The US cannot adopt this policy or every other poor nation around the world will get the same idea. Either Kim has to back down or he will have to be prepared to go to war. I doubt the US and the rest of the world is going to wait much longer since North Korea is close to their nuclear goals now. I find it amazing we haven't already retaliated or at least got this movement towards a war further along, unless we are planning a sneak pre-emptive strike that we just haven't heard about.",

   "You don't attack a country with nuclear weapons.\n\n \n Well what do we do with them then? Keep giving them aid so they can build up and really begin to make legitimate threats against the US? Put sanctions on them to wear them down and force them to make the first strike after they have had time to build up a stronger force?\n \n Neither of those options should be at the top of the what to do list but perhaps they are. My options if I'm the US government is to first find out to a great degree of certainty whether they have nukes or not. Perhaps they do, perhaps they don't, although they probably do have 1 or 2. Next they need to find out for sure how far they can shoot. We have to know this so we can estimate where they would hit. If they cannot hit the US, then the best option we have is to secretly put our experimental nuclear weapons targeting systems in Tokyo, Seoul, and other major targets. It is pretty likely they could target Hawaii as well though. Next we have to force their hand by launching our own attack on their nuclear reactors and any area we believe nuclear weapons could be located. These strikes have to be quick, coordinated, and as massive as can be arranged because it will be the only strike we can manage before the nukes would be launched. From there, we can only hope that we succeed either in our first attacks or our defensive measure or that the Korean government is not coherent enough to strike back before it is neutralized.\n \n Saying \"You don't attack a country with nuclear weapons\" will cause problems for a number of reasons. The biggest being that by saying this we encourage other nations to build nukes and then we leave them alone while they build up their force. They begin demanding bigger and bigger stuff after this and of course we have to give in assuming they threaten nuclear war along with their demands. Eventually all International law falls to pieces and countries like N Korea who are willing to launch nuclear wars become more and more daring.\n \n Just to test your theory, lets say that North Korea invaded South Korea, killed thousands of American troops, and threatened nuclear war against the US if we did anything about it. We absolutely couldn't stand down at that point. If we did, then what do we do when they encroach on Japan? How about Guam? Then Hawaii? Then our own borders? What they are asking right now is for time to get more weapons so they can become a big enough threat that no one in their right mind would stop them from taking South Korea. We cannot allow that time because Kim is too erratic to predict and perhaps his ultimate goal is to land United Korea troops in the United States.\n \n Nuclear weapons are not the end all unless your talking China, Great Britain, Russia, US, France, Israel, or others with 50 or more ICBMs. North Korea is in a weak position now and they know it. They are threatening to get more time so they can begin to make serious threats. I don't wish for a nuclear conflict in my life time but I also realize it will likely occur. I don't want to see Americans die by the millions just because the little dictatorship of North Korea was allowed to become a nuclear threat to us. We have to deal with this problem eventually so why not do it while they are weak and we are ready to absolutely obliterate their entire nation if they dare launch a single nuke at us or anyone else?\n \n BTW, I am a huge supporter of anti-nuclear weapons such as those laser systems we are testing now. I realize why so many countries are threatened by the idea because that would mean the US could nuke anyone and never be retaliated against because of this technology. But in the world of today, this technology would be traded or stolen by others and eventually a global shield would be in place. Countries like North Korea would be without them for quite some time and wouldn't be able to be the terror threats they are today. I hope China and Russia both lift their opposition to this technology and begin researching it for themselves along with the rest of the UN.",

They have nukes and are still making them, but, they are not capable of shooting a nuclear warhead at the United States.\n I recently did a report on the Nuclear Weapons for a school persuasive speech. Let me tell you, America is the only remaining superpower. The word \"SUPERPOWER\" means a nation with world influence, and a huge bloc of allies. Plus, nuclear weapons are what made Amerika and the former Soviet Union Superpowers. When the other was caft down by capitolism, Amerika became the last remaining.\n America, to this very day as I have learned, is the only nation that can fire a nuclear warhead at any country around the world. We can launch a nuclear missile at ANY country. No country besides us can do that. North Korea the farthest they could hit is Japan and if they do that, millions of angry Chinese will retaliate. \n Some countries can, however, fire at the United States, but, they won't. Cause if they do, the Amerikans would retaliate with quadroople the amount of nukes. No country has the manhood big enough t launch against any country cause nine out of ten chances, the Amerikans would get involved.\n As for North Korea, they are just a little kid. They need a little attention, and that is all. North Korea CAN NOT launch against the United States. Beleive me, I have done my research and the farthest they could launch is Japan and possibly even Cina. \n I also, would like to clarify something in case you all still don't understand. When I say the United States can fire nukes at any country around the world, they can. That is the reason we remain a superpower, plus the other two reasons. We have a huge bloc of allies and world influence. Now, some of you might think, wait a minute, nukes did not make us a superpower. Well, actualy they did.\n Sergei",

We should also invade cause they have threatened countries including us.
