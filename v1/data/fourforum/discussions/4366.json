   "I'm just tingling in anticipation! Today is the day. It's Tuesday and HeavenBound has promised to post the \"proof\" that radiocarbon dating is not reliable. I'm sure that this will turn the science of archaeology on its ear, especially Biblical archaeology that has placed a lot of credence in the dating of finds in Near East. As stated in the Library of Congress Exhitit on the Dead Sea Scrolls, \"Within a fairly short time after their discovery, historical, paleographic, and linguistic evidence, as well as carbon-14 dating, established that the scrolls and the Qumran ruin dated from the third century B.C.E. to 68 C.E.\" Radiocarbon dating has recently been used to verify that the dates of the Hitite civilization as per the Bible are correct, and not some 200 years later as previously believed. Just think, HeavenBound's \"proof\" will make nonsense of so much Biblical scholarship that it will be a disaster for all western religions.\n \n But I look forward to the \"proof.\" This is a paradigm shifting revelation that will also upset most of science. This \"proof\" will upset nuclear physics by showing that the technology is based on error (will it cause the closing of all nuclear reactors?). It will upset geology and paleontology by showing that all dates are unreliable. It will also upset astrophysics by showing that the detection of radioactive elements in heavenly bodies that are light years away (eg., cobalt-56 and cobalt-57 in SN1987A at 170,000 light years) are wrong. In effect, the dating of the universe, the earth, and human civilization will be thrown into termoil. A whole new era of science is about to dawn and I look forward to it.\n \n So let us all hope that HeavenBound was not just trolling. She wouldn't actually promise something and then not deliver, would she? Sometimes it seems that she in just a bit incoherent. For example, here are some of her remarks from other threads.\n \nI didn't realize evolutionist were so closed-minded when I entered this forum.\n\n Well! I guess that just showed you guys. It seems that HeavenBound thinks that having a closed mind is a bad thing. And yet,\n \n...even if I did do more research my stance would not change.\n\n What? How is that an example of an open mind. It seems that a closed mind is a virtue only in a non-religionist. Isn't the above statement the equivalent of a declaration of a closed mind?\n \nI have given evolution a fair shot, I believe God made all life on earth to evolve.\n\n Now I'm confused. In the same breath HeavenBound tells us that she accepts and rejects the science of evolutionary biology. I wonder if giving evolutionary biology a fair chance is like giving gravity a fair chance, or the heliocentric theory, or maybe the germ theory of disease? Did she give all of those a \"fair chance\" too? How about nuclear physics? And yet, as I mentioned above, HeavenBound has rejected most of science apparently, because she is going to offer \"proof\" that falsifies cosmology, astronomy, astrophysics, nuclear physics (or, as our President says, \"nucular physics\"), anthropology, paleontology, geology, and biology.\n \n So it seems that HeavenBound is a theistic evolutionist, believing that evolution is just God's method of creation. Her opinions seem contradictory to me.\n \nAll you hardball Evolutionist remind me of Spock from Star Trek, you can only think in logical terms.\n\n If we are talking about ideas that work by means of logic, why does HeavenBound think that it is wrong to use logic? Why is it better to address logical topics with ideas based on mythology, spiritualism, and superstition? I haven't ever seen a peer reviewed paper that described how verification for a hypothesis was sought in the Bible, but it seems that HeavenBound finds that idea logical.\n \nI mean scientist know evolution isn't 100% absolute truth, but no one on this forum is willing to admit there could be other possibilities out there.\n\n Actually, you haven't understood much of what has been discussed here, have you. Scientists are quite sure that evolution is 100% absolute. It is quite simple. Evolution has been observed. There is no question whatsoever. Changes in populations of organisms that meet the definition of biological evolution have been observed and are observed all the time. Strains of drosophila used for genetic studies have speciated several times so that many of them are no longer able to interbreed. This is in spite of the fact that they are all derived from a single population. The original strain was domesticated in California. Recent experiments have shown that the laboratory strains can't interbreed with the original population any more either. That is evolution. There is no doubt. The DNA of Drosophila has been sequenced and studied and differences that prevent interfertility have been identified. That is evolution. That is 100% sure. What isn't sure is whether the theories that explain these facts are correct. For most of the fundamental theories we are about 99% sure. Some of the newer work is less secure. New theories on the frontiers of knowledge are still being tested and amended.\n \n But of course, it is evolutionists who have closed minds and not religionists.\n \n...all I'd like to see is you open your mind to other possibilities.\n\n Where appropriate, I do. Unfortunately for you, there is no room in science for \"POOF, GODDIDIT!\" as an explanation of the causes for observed natural events. Recourse to a miracle is giving up on learning. It is a declaration that we can't learn by the application of a logical method of study, the scientific method, to natural events that are observed in the natural universe. It is a declaration that mythology, spiritualism, and superstition is more reliable than logic. It is a declaration that a closed mind is the best way to learn.\n \n Oh, yeah. HeavenBound. This post is mocking. I thought I would tell you that since you seem to have a great deal of determining when you are being mocked and when someone is trying to educate you. It seems that you respond to mocking better than you respond to education, since you haven't bothered to educate yourself about science to this point.\n \n Looking forward to the evidence. Don't disappoint. And remember, anything from AIG, ICR, and Mr. Hovind isn't proof unless you can explain and verify any assertions. In other words, you will need to be able to show why your \"proof\" is a better explanation for the data than science - Occam's razor you know.",

   "I don't think HeavenBound is a troll. I think she is a real, honest-to-god scientifically illiterate creationist. She entered the board with a major case of snide (yes HeavenBound, I know that snide is an adjective, and I know that I used it as a noun, but coining a new usage in this case seemed appropriate) and then accused me of mocking her. I never did so intentionally. The specific quote that she claimed was mocking was when I called here a dupe. It wasn't mocking, it was a statement of observation based on many years of debating with closed minded creationists. Most are dupes. Most are scientifically illiterate. Most are only semi-literate.\n \n In fact, as most of you are aware, polls by Gallup and others have shown that creationists tend to be less educated, less affluent, female, southern, and rural. They are gullable and believe what anyone who claims to be a christian and a \"creation scientists\" tells them.\n \n My bet is that HeavenBound will present unsupported assertions about radiometric dating. She has already made the claim that it is based on assumption. It certainly is. It is based on the assumption that the laws and forces of nature that we see in effect in the universe today are the same forces of nature that have always been in effect in the universe. We also assume that by careful observation and application of the scientific method we can learn about those forces.",

It will also upset astrophysics by showing that the detection of radioactive elements in heavenly bodies that are light years away (eg., cobalt-56 and cobalt-57 in SN1987A at 170,000 light years) are wrong. In effect, the dating of the universe, the earth, and human civilization will be thrown into termoil. A whole new era of science is about to dawn and I look forward to it.\n \n So let us all hope that HeavenBound was not just trolling. She wouldn't actually promise something and then not deliver, would she? Sometimes it seems that she in just a bit incoherent. For example, here are some of her remarks from other threads.\n \n Well! I guess that just showed you guys. It seems that HeavenBound thinks that having a closed mind is a bad thing. And yet,\n \n What? How is that an example of an open mind. It seems that a closed mind is a virtue only in a non-religionist. Isn't the above statement the equivalent of a declaration of a closed mind?\n \n Now I'm confused. In the same breath HeavenBound tells us that she accepts and rejects the science of evolutionary biology. I wonder if giving evolutionary biology a fair chance is like giving gravity a fair chance, or the heliocentric theory, or maybe the germ theory of disease? Did she give all of those a \"fair chance\" too? How about nuclear physics? And yet, as I mentioned above, HeavenBound has rejected most of science apparently, because she is going to offer \"proof\" that falsifies cosmology, astronomy, astrophysics, nuclear physics (or, as our President says, \"nucular physics\"), anthropology, paleontology, geology, and biology.\n \n So it seems that HeavenBound is a theistic evolutionist, believing that evolution is just God's method of creation. Her opinions seem contradictory to me.\n \n If we are talking about ideas that work by means of logic, why does HeavenBound think that it is wrong to use logic? Why is it better to address logical topics with ideas based on mythology, spiritualism, and superstition? I haven't ever seen a peer reviewed paper that described how verification for a hypothesis was sought in the Bible, but it seems that HeavenBound finds that idea logical.\n \n Actually, you haven't understood much of what has been discussed here, have you. Scientists are quite sure that evolution is 100% absolute. It is quite simple. Evolution has been observed. There is no question whatsoever. Changes in populations of organisms that meet the definition of biological evolution have been observed and are observed all the time. Strains of drosophila used for genetic studies have speciated several times so that many of them are no longer able to interbreed. This is in spite of the fact that they are all derived from a single population. The original strain was domesticated in California. Recent experiments have shown that the laboratory strains can't interbreed with the original population any more either. That is evolution. There is no doubt. The DNA of Drosophila has been sequenced and studied and differences that prevent interfertility have been identified. That is evolution. That is 100% sure. What isn't sure is whether the theories that explain these facts are correct. For most of the fundamental theories we are about 99% sure. Some of the newer work is less secure. New theories on the frontiers of knowledge are still being tested and amended.\n \n But of course, it is evolutionists who have closed minds and not religionists.\n \n Where appropriate, I do. Unfortunately for you, there is no room in science for \"POOF, GODDIDIT!\" as an explanation of the causes for observed natural events. Recourse to a miracle is giving up on learning. It is a declaration that we can't learn by the application of a logical method of study, the scientific method, to natural events that are observed in the natural universe. It is a declaration that mythology, spiritualism, and superstition is more reliable than logic. It is a declaration that a closed mind is the best way to learn.\n \n Oh, yeah. HeavenBound. This post is mocking. I thought I would tell you that since you seem to have a great deal of determining when you are being mocked and when someone is trying to educate you. It seems that you respond to mocking better than you respond to education, since you haven't bothered to educate yourself about science to this point.\n \n Looking forward to the evidence. Don't disappoint. And remember, anything from AIG, ICR, and Mr. Hovind isn't proof unless you can explain and verify any assertions. In other words, you will need to be able to show why your \"proof\" is a better explanation for the data than science - Occam's razor you know.\n\n Why is it that some of you choose to antagonise members of this board that have a Christian belief system and believe something else occurred instead of sciences evolution theory? Much of Christianity is faith based, meaning we don't have hard core 'proof' of creationism. Some of you are a bit hard on posters in here that don't share your opinion on evolution (as this belittling attempt at a post suggest). \n I would suggest in the future that some of you tone down your mocking of fellow posters. Its not respectful and does not add one iota to good debate.",

Evolutionist fundies would do well to take a much less condescending and rude approach when dealing with creationist people--they'd probably be a lot farther in convincing religious people of their views by now if they did.\n \n I accept evolution--I am now of the \"theistic evolution\" view. Please consider that evolution and faith in God as creator don't have to be juxataposed to each other. I understand your thoughts as to why you believe the way you do because I used to as well. But I have come to realize that a christian doesn't have to compromise belief at all to note and accept scientific reality. God is no less God if Genesis 1 took place in 6 literal days or over eons. There is even Biblical basis for the timelessness of what God does: one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.--2 Peter 3:8 Maybe all the matter and energy in the universe was created at a point and has expanded and contracted ever since. Who knows? The one thing we can believe that science will never be able to disprove is that there is a Creator and that He created and creates all things (ultimately through the physical laws and natural processes that he put in place and maintains). Isn't that really what it's best about anyway: the Creator rather than the method?\n \n As someone who knows exactly how you feel, I would encourage you to consider thinking of evolution and scientific theory as something other than being a threat to faith. It really isn't. Evolution really is real, and has been observed and is observable. There's really no way around it, but the bottom line is that we have to stop thinking of the whole issue as creation [b]versus[/i] evolution.

Evolutionary scientists try to predict which strain will be the most prevelant the following year in order to product enough vaccine. Some years they have missed and the available vaccine has been less than effective against the most prevalent virus. The problem is that the flu virus evolves so rapidly.\n \n Right now we are witnessing the evolution of a brand new killer strain in the far east. Bird flu has again been making the jump to humans, and recently there have been cases that were passed from human to human. Twice in the last century similar avian flu strains have made the jump directly from birds to humans.\n \n SARS is another virus that evolved in order to jump from the animal host (civit) to humans.\n \n And, of course, there is HIV that probably evolved from a strain of Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) that was passed to a human either from bush meat or from a bite by an animal.\n \n And that's just a couple of examples of bacteria and virus. Drosophila (fruit fly) was domesticated from a wild population in California. All laboratory strains have been bread from this initial domestication. And yet, there are several known lines of domesticated flies that can no longer interbreed. Attempts to breed domesticated strains with the original population have failed. The domesticated strains of Drosophila have speciated several times.\n \n And then there are ring species. Ring species live in a favorable environment that encircles a region that is not favorable. One is the herring gull-lesser black-backed gull. These two species of gull share the same range and do not interbreed. And yet they are the two separate ends of a continuous population the encircles the pole in the norther himisphere.\n \n Another example is a salamender in which the population encircles California's central valley. Where the two extreme ends of the population meet at the southern end, they are unable to interbreed. There is a warbler that encircles the Tibetan plateau. Same thing. The two ends of the population are separate species.\n \n The first black morph of the peppered moth was observed in 1848. By 1900, 98% of the moths in industrialized areas were black. After about 1950, the black morphs became rarer and rarer until they are only 1 or 2% of the population today.\n \n And of course, whale fossils have been found with hind legs. Whales today don't have hind legs but they did in the past.\n \n So we have observed the process of evolution again and again.\n \nI think it has been more theorized (if thats a word) then anything else. Creating theories for theories and so on.\n\n Yes, the word theorized exists but you don't seem to know what it means. A scientific theory is an explanation for the observed facts. We have observed evolution and the theories explain the mechanisms that caused the evolution. Theories have been tested.\n \n Why don't you give us an example of a theory of evolution that is based on a theory of evolution.",
