   "The problem with questions like that is that you never know what might have been or what may be in the future. This is why our constitution is set up the way it was and our forefathers were insightful enough not to install a pure democracy where 50.00001% of the people could do whatever they wanted. It was to ensure that rights that we might need later are not foolishly squandered.\n \n I have heard the argument that the second amendment has no meaning today, that it is outdated and unneeded. If that is the case, I urge the anti-gunners to get it repealed. I am a constitutionalist. If the second amendment was to be repealed, I would be first in line to hand in my guns for destruction. Until that happens, I will enjoy the rights that come with being an American.\n \n Voice of reason, you might take a look at the rest of the miller case. The miller case specifically stated that the right to bear arms was an individual right. The fact that it is inextricably connected to the preservation of the milita means (according to the miller decision) that the only weapons specifically covered by the second amendment are weapons that would be useful in maintaining a militia. This means military type weapons or weapons that would be useful in a military capacity.\n \n Here is the quote from the briefing:\n \n \"In the absence of evidence tending to show that possession or use of a 'shotgun having a barrel of less than 18 inches in length,' which is the subject of regulation and taxation by the National Firearms Act of June 26, 1934, has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well-regulated militia, it cannot be said the the Second Amendment to the Federal Constitution guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument, or that the statute violates such constitutional provision.\"\n \n \"It is not within judicial notice that a shotgun having a barrel of less than 18 inches in length is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense.\"\n \n Here is the MILLER courts definition of \"militia\"\n \n \"The signification attributed to the term Militia appears from the debates in the Convention, the history and legislation of Colonies and States, and the writings of approved commentators. These show plainly enough that the Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. \"A body of citizens enrolled for military discipline.\" And further, that ordinarily when called for service these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time.\"\n \n Much to the frustration of the anti-gunners that would argue that the national gaurd is the militia, or that the right to bear arms is a collective on because of the militia clause, the only supreme court case law that touches on the issue clearly defines the militia as \"all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense\". \n \n In a couple of other cases regarding militias, the court has ruled that the states only retain the right to assemble the militia one time per year to ensure that they were properly armed (in most states men who were eligable for militia duty were required by law to provide their own military weapons). Assembeling the militia for any other purpose was illegal (standing army).\n \n If you are going to use a quotation from MILLER, pls use the whole section, not just the 10 words that support your viewpoint. At one time I did think miller was anti second amendment becuase of all the MILLER cites I saw the anti gunners using. Then, I looked up the miller case for myself and went \"my god, can't these XXXXXX read?\" Of course, now that I am a little older and a little wiser, I know it is not an issue of literacy, it is an issue of honesty.",

The Supreme Court has defined the modern day militia as the National Guard-\n \n \"The National Guard is the modern Militia reserved to the States by Art. I. 8, cl. 15, 16, of the Constitution....The passage of the National Defense Act of 1916 materially altered the status of the militias by constituting them as the National Guard.\"\n Maryland v. United States, 381 U.S. 41, 46 (1965)\n \n And more recently in 1990 the Supreme Court ruled that \"Notwithstanding the brief periods of federal service, the members of the state Guard unit continue to satisfy this description of a militia.\"\n Perpich v.

   "The perpich case did not establish the definition of \"militia\" as a whole. It simply defined the National guard as a portion of the \"active militia\", drawn from the general population of the state, which comprises the militia as a whole. The court did concur that it might be unconstitutional for the federal governmetn to require active duty training by a truly state milita, the National Gaurd is an extension of the federal guard, although not on active duty unless needed. \n \n In the maryland case, the National gaurd is defined as the militia as defined by the article 1 of the constitution. It is strongly implied, however, that the definition of \"militia\" as used in article one, and the definition of the same word in the second amendment may be different. This is obvious in the fact that the text of the decision specifically states that \n \n //quote//\n The national Guard is the modern Militia reserved to the States by Art. I. 8, cl. 15, 16, of the Constitution\n //quote//\n \n It does not say \"the national guard is the modern militia reserved to the states by the constitution\"\n \n Here are the relevant clasues from the constitution:\n \n //quote//\n Clause 15: To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions; \n \n Clause 16: To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress; \n //end quote//\n \n The definition, as laid out by this case, only applies to those 2 clauses of the constitution. No where else. Specifically, it does not neccesarily apply to the definition of militia as used in the second amendment. The only supreme court decision which has ever addressed that is Miller.\n \n And, of course the comprised is past tense, they were citing historical reference. How else would you phrase a statement like that when discussing historical references?\n \n The big question as to the second amendment is, does the first phrase mean anything at all? Several legal documents of the period ere written in that format. There is an introductory clause, then the main phrase. You can argue this all you want, but that is the way it is. This was a common writing method in use at the time. Textbooks which have survived from the time teach this writing style, although they refered to it as a \"purpose clause\" as opposed to an \"introdutory clause\"\n \n Some other examples:\n \n From the Rhode Island constitution:\n //quote//\n \"The liberty of the press being essential to the security of freedom in a state, any person may publish sentiments on any subject, being responsible for the abuse of that liberty.\"\n //end quote//\n \n This passage would seem to ensure the freedom of speech. By using the second amendment argument argument that the first statement is the main statement, however, it does not. That clause would limit free speech to that which is directly connected to the security of freedom. By that thinking, discussion of recipes, cars, the weather, or the price of tea could be prohibited.\n \n Another example from the New Hampshire constitution:\n //quote//\n \"Economy being a most essential virtue in all states, especially in a young one; no pension shall be granted, but in consideration of actual services, and such pensions ought to be granted with great caution, by the legislature, and never for more than one year at a time.\"\n //end quote//\n \n This amendment is commonly held to make pensions of longer than one yer at a time void. However, if you apply the forementioned method of thinking, it would only apply to the state when it was \"young\".\n \n If you want some more examples of this, look up \"Volokh\". He provides dozens of examples form state constitutions.\n \n Ultimatly, what needs to be done in order to solve the second amendment question is to put it directly to the supreme court. Anytime a second amendment case comes up, though, both sides of the issue do their best to torpedo it. This is why I am no longer a supporter of the NRA, or of HCI. I am an American, and I believe in our system of government. I want to see this hit the supreme court, as is proper with constitutional questions, and I will resign myself to whatever decision the court makes. That is how America is supposed to work.",

In China were there are no guns, the army was quite comfortable to rape and kill women and children at will. \n \n Iraq is handing the 82nd Airborne thier hinnie as we speak. The militia is not going to stand head to head on a battlefield. That is the job of the standing army, not the militia. The civilians and irregulars in Iraq are doing EXACTLY what the militia will do in the USA agains a forgein invader.

   "In the context of the Miller case, the milita mentioned in article one of the contitution and the militia mentioned in the second amendment are the same. The \"militia\" metioned in article 1 is the active militia, which is drawn from the \"militia\" as a whole, which is every able bodied man, yadda, yadda. \n \n For the purpose of the Miller decision, it was not necessary to distinguish between the active militia (national gaurd) and the militia as a whole (everybody).
