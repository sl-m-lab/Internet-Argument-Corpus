There was a similar feeling about Fidel in Cuba, and although by the time we got to China the Mao cult was being distinctly played down the echoes were certainly there.\n \n There does seem to be an uncanny recurrence of themes in these secular religions:[*]an infallible figure of veneration[*]an ideology associated with this figure that governs all aspects of life[*]a sacred and infallible text (Capital, My Struggle, the Little Red Book).\n Presumably this is why avowedly secular states that start off declaring their tolerance of conventional religion (like the USSR) end up persecuting it: after all, who needs competition?",

Korea, though he might have been touching on my post as well. In your list, we'd probably agree that ritual, symbol and creed are not hard to find in the personality cults of avowedly secular states: the interesting one I suppose is transcendence. Here Kim Jong Il's boosters really do take centre stage:\n \n \nWhen the Dear Leader played his first ever round of golf at the country's only club, the testing 7,700-yard course at Pyongyang, he completed his round in a mere 34 shots, a score some 25 shots lower than the next lowest round in history. What made the round even more incredible, if that were possible, was that the general also recorded no less than five holes-in-one on his way round. Now, the odds of getting a hole-in-one for an average golfer, incidentally, have been calculated by Golf Digest magazine at 12,000-1, so to get five, and in your very first round, without a single lesson, well...\n\n http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguide/features/story/0,,1857340,00.html\n \n If that isn't transcendence I don't know what is. An almost equally clumsy attempt to flatter a quasi-divine leader with something beyond normal human powers was the blatantly faked photo of Mao swimming the Yangtze River at the age of 73.\n \n Are there other examples? Was the mummification of Lenin's corpse in Red Square an attempt to imply transcendence? Any views?",

My point in quoting it, however, is that a Roman influence on the development of the early church might be debated on all sorts of grounds but cannot be dismissed solely on the grounds that its writings were in Greek.\n\n \n To an extent I agree. However that was not the point I was trying to make. One can see a 'Greek influence' on Christianity. However the poster I responded to said that the Roman empire influences Christainity/invented it/ etc. without showing what those influences were.\n \n Greek influence I would accept.

Now I know you said 'Romans' as opposed to 'Roman Empire' but I did ask you for a clarification on what you meant by that.

   "That's a bad argument. Betulah is ambiguous. The married woman in Joel 1:8 is a betulah. In Esther chapter 2 the king's concubines were referred to as betulah's even after they spent the night with the King. And finally, a betulah could well be a much older woman. Almah was the better choice for Isaiah 7:14.\n\n \n It was my error in post #52 to claim that Joel 1.8 used almah. Apologies: I should read my sources more carefully.\n \n It remains the case that biological virginity is only an implied adjunct to almah, not its central meaning; and you still have not addressed the point that 'an almah shall conceive' is a perfectly meaningful prediction without suggesting virgin birth. It implies 'without having sex first' only if you deliberately read that in.",

   "You are missing the point, I think. Almah is a word meaning a young woman of marriageable age but not yet married. Certainly it would have been the norm in that society for such a woman to be a virgin; nonetheless that state is a peripheral adjunct to the word, not its central definition. If Isaiah was, as christians claim, foreshadowing such a miraculous event, of which its protagonist's biological virginity was the very core and essence, it would make no sense to use almah when bethulah was available.\n\n \n If the words are synonyms then there is no problem.\n \nIgnoring for a moment the inconvenient present tense of modern translations, writing 'an almah shall conceive' does not in any case necessarily prefigure a virgin birth. If I were acquainted with a young woman whom I believed to be a virgin, and knew that she was about to get married, I could well predict 'That young woman is going to conceive'. If for some reason I was speaking Hebrew I might well call her almah; but no-one in their right mind would think I meant that she was going to conceive without having sex first. Nor is there any such necessary implication in Isaiah: the virgin birth is the Matthew author's retrofit.\n\n \n No one in her right mind? That's why it's a miracle.",

The fact is that the Septuagint, which is the Jewish translation made in pre-Christian Alexandria, takes almah to mean \"virgin\" here. Accordingly, the New Testament follows Jewish interpretation in Isaiah 7:14. Therefore, the New Testament rendering of almah as \"virgin\" for Isaiah 7:14 rests on the older Jewish interpretation,...\n \n In addition, the respected biblical commentator Rashi (Rabbi Shelomoh Ben Yitzhaki) states that alma means virgin in his commentary on Song of Solomon 1:3. Specifically, Rashi states that alma is synonymous with another Hebrew word that means virgin, the word betulah. The rabbis unequivocally state that betulah means virgin as well. Almah and betulah are nearly synonymous terms, meaning \"virgin.\" However, alma is the more restricted term and never needs explanatory information. (it denotes a YOUNG maiden / virgin, whereas a betulah can mean an older woman, even a married one, as in Joel 1:8 - EZ).\n \n http://www.hadavar.org/Virgin.html\n \n Now, your respected Jewish Rabbis must also be dishonest as well! \n \n Duh.",

   "That's ridiculous. \n \n We have the opinion of Dr. Cyrus Gordon, Professor of Assyriology and Egyptology in Dropsie College, in his article Almah in Isaiah 7:14(The Journal of Bible & Religion, vol. 21 [April 1953], p.106):\n \n The commonly held view that \"virgin\" is Christian, whereas \"young woman\" is Jewish is not quite true. The fact is that the Septuagint, which is the Jewish translation made in pre-Christian Alexandria, takes almah to mean \"virgin\" here. Accordingly, the New Testament follows Jewish interpretation in Isaiah 7:14. Therefore, the New Testament rendering of almah as \"virgin\" for Isaiah 7:14 rests on the older Jewish interpretation,...\n \n In addition, the respected biblical commentator Rashi (Rabbi Shelomoh Ben Yitzhaki) states that alma means virgin in his commentary on Song of Solomon 1:3. Specifically, Rashi states that alma is synonymous with another Hebrew word that means virgin, the word betulah. The rabbis unequivocally state that betulah means virgin as well. Almah and betulah are nearly synonymous terms, meaning \"virgin.\" However, alma is the more restricted term and never needs explanatory information. (it denotes a YOUNG maiden / virgin, whereas a betulah can mean an older woman, even a married one, as in Joel 1:8 - EZ).\n \n http://www.hadavar.org/Virgin.html\n \n Now, your respected Jewish Rabbis must also be dishonest as well! \n \n Duh.\n\n \n \n \n Guess what...\n \n I looked at that in the Zohar.\n \n Your source lied.",

The Bible says that he will: \n \n A. Build the Third Temple (Ezekiel 37:26-28). \n \n B. Gather all Jews back to the Land of Israel (Isaiah 43:5-6). \n \n C. Usher in an era of world peace, and end all hatred, oppression, suffering and disease. As it says: \"Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall man learn war anymore.\" (Isaiah 2:4) \n \n D. Spread universal knowledge of the God of Israel, which will unite humanity as one. As it says: \"God will be King over all the world -- on that day, God will be One and His Name will be One\" (Zechariah 14:9). \n \n The historical fact is that Jesus fulfilled none of these messianic prophecies. \n \n Christians counter that Jesus will fulfill these in the Second Coming, but Jewish sources show that the Messiah will fulfill the prophecies outright, and no concept of a second coming exists.\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n 2) JESUS DID NOT EMBODY THE PERSONAL QUALIFICATIONS OF MESSIAH\n \n A. MESSIAH AS PROPHET\n \n Jesus was not a prophet. Prophecy can only exist in Israel when the land is inhabited by a majority of world Jewry. During the time of Ezra (circa 300 BCE), when the majority of Jews refused to move from Babylon to Israel, prophecy ended upon the death of the last prophets -- Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi. \n \n Jesus appeared on the scene approximately 350 years after prophecy had ended. \n \n B. DESCENDENT OF DAVID \n \n The Messiah must be descended on his father's side from King David (see Genesis 49:10 and Isaiah 11:1). According to the Christian claim that Jesus was the product of a virgin birth, he had no father -- and thus could not have possibly fulfilled the messianic requirement of being descended on his father's side from King David! \n \n C. TORAH OBSERVANCE\n \n The Messiah will lead the Jewish people to full Torah observance. The Torah states that all mitzvot remain binding forever, and anyone coming to change the Torah is immediately identified as a false prophet. (Deut. 13:1-4) \n \n Throughout the New Testament, Jesus contradicts the Torah and states that its commandments are no longer applicable. For example, John 9:14 records that Jesus made a paste in violation of Shabbat, which caused the Pharisees to say (verse 16), \"He does not observe Shabbat!\" \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n 3) MISTRANSLATED VERSES \"REFERRING\" TO JESUS\n \n Biblical verses can only be understood by studying the original Hebrew text -- which reveals many discrepancies in the Christian translation. \n \n A. VIRGIN BIRTH \n \n The Christian idea of a virgin birth is derived from the verse in Isaiah 7:14 describing an \"alma\" as giving birth. The word \"alma\" has always meant a young woman, but Christian theologians came centuries later and translated it as \"virgin.\" This accords Jesus' birth with the first century pagan idea of mortals being impregnated by gods. \n \n B. CRUCIFIXION \n \n The verse in Psalms 22:17 reads: \"Like a lion, they are at my hands and feet.\" The Hebrew word ki-ari (like a lion) is grammatically similar to the word \"gouged.\" Thus Christianity reads the verse as a reference to crucifixion: \"They pierced my hands and feet.\" \n \n C. SUFFERING SERVANT \n \n Christianity claims that Isaiah chapter 53 refers to Jesus, as the \"suffering servant.\" \n \n In actuality, Isaiah 53 directly follows the theme of chapter 52, describing the exile and redemption of the Jewish people. The prophecies are written in the singular form because the Jews (\"Israel\") are regarded as one unit. The Torah is filled with examples of the Jewish nation referred to with a singular pronoun. \n \n Ironically, Isaiah's prophecies of persecution refer in part to the 11th century when Jews were tortured and killed by Crusaders who acted in the name of Jesus. \n \n From where did these mistranslations stem? St. Gregory, 4th century Bishop of Nanianzus, wrote: \"A little jargon is all that is necessary to impose on the people. The less they comprehend, the more they admire.\" \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n 4) JEWISH BELIEF IS BASED SOLELY ON NATIONAL REVELATION\n \n Of the 15,000 religions in human history, only Judaism bases its belief on national revelation -- i.e. God speaking to the entire nation. If God is going to start a religion, it makes sense He'll tell everyone, not just one person. \n \n Judaism, unique among all of the world's major religions, does not rely on \"claims of miracles\" as the basis for its religion. In fact, the Bible says that God sometimes grants the power of \"miracles\" to charlatans, in order to test Jewish loyalty to the Torah (Deut. 13:4). \n \n Maimonides states (Foundations of Torah, ch. 8): \n \n \n The Jews did not believe in Moses, our teacher, because of the miracles he performed. Whenever anyone's belief is based on seeing miracles, he has lingering doubts, because it is possible the miracles were performed through magic or sorcery. All of the miracles performed by Moses in the desert were because they were necessary, and not as proof of his prophecy. \n \n What then was the basis of [Jewish] belief? The Revelation at Mount Sinai, which we saw with our own eyes and heard with our own ears, not dependent on the testimony of others... as it says, \"Face to face, God spoke with you...\" The Torah also states: \"God did not make this covenant with our fathers, but with us -- who are all here alive today.\" (Deut. 5:3)\n \n \n Judaism is not miracles. It is the personal eyewitness experience of every man, woman and child, standing at Mount Sinai 3,300 years ago.\n \n See \"Did God Speak at Mount Sinai\" for further reading. \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n 5) CHRISTIANITY CONTRADICTS JEWISH THEOLOGY\n \n The following theological points apply primarily to the Roman Catholic Church, the largest Christian denomination.\n \n A. GOD AS THREE?\n \n The Catholic idea of Trinity breaks God into three separate beings: The Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost (Matthew 28:19). \n \n Contrast this to the Shema, the basis of Jewish belief: \"Hear O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is ONE\" (Deut. 6:4). Jews declare the Shema every day, while writing it on doorposts (Mezuzah), and binding it to the hand and head (Tefillin). This statement of God's One-ness is the first words a Jewish child is taught to say, and the last words uttered before a Jew dies. \n \n In Jewish law, worship of a three-part god is considered idolatry -- one of the three cardinal sins that a Jew should rather give up his life than transgress. This explains why during the Inquisitions and throughout history, Jews gave up their lives rather than convert. \n \n B. MAN AS GOD?\n \n Roman Catholics believe that God came down to earth in human form, as Jesus said: \"I and the Father are one\" (John 10:30). \n \n Maimonides devotes most of the \"Guide for the Perplexed\" to the fundamental idea that God is incorporeal, meaning that He assumes no physical form. God is Eternal, above time. He is Infinite, beyond space. He cannot be born, and cannot die. Saying that God assumes human form makes God small, diminishing both His unity and His divinity. As the Torah says: \"God is not a mortal\" (Numbers 23:19). \n \n Judaism says that the Messiah will be born of human parents, and possess normal physical attributes like other people. He will not be a demi-god, and will not possess supernatural qualities. In fact, an individual is alive in every generation with the capacity to step into the role of the Messiah. (see Maimonides - Laws of Kings 11:3) \n \n C. INTERMEDIARY FOR PRAYER?\n \n The Catholic belief is that prayer must be directed through an intermediary -- i.e. confessing one's sins to a priest. Jesus himself is an intermediary, as Jesus said: \"No man cometh unto the Father but by me.\" \n \n In Judaism, prayer is a totally private matter, between each individual and God. As the Bible says: \"God is near to all who call unto Him\" (Psalms 145:18). Further, the Ten Commandments state: \"You shall have no other gods BEFORE ME,\" meaning that it is forbidden to set up a mediator between God and man. (see Maimonides - Laws of Idolatry ch. 1) \n \n D. INVOLVEMENT IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD\n \n Catholic doctrine often treats the physical world as an evil to be avoided. Mary, the holiest woman, is portrayed as a virgin. Priests and nuns are celibate. And monasteries are in remote, secluded locations. \n \n By contrast, Judaism believes that God created the physical world not to frustrate us, but for our pleasure. Jewish spirituality comes through grappling with the mundane world in a way that uplifts and elevates. Sex in the proper context is one of the holiest acts we can perform. \n \n The Talmud says if a person has the opportunity to taste a new fruit and refuses to do so, he will have to account for that in the World to Come. Jewish rabbinical schools teach how to live amidst the bustle of commercial activity. Jews don't retreat from life, we elevate it. \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n 6) JEWS AND GENTILES\n \n Judaism does not demand that everyone convert to the religion. The Torah of Moses is a truth for all humanity, whether Jewish or not. King Solomon asked God to heed the prayers of non-Jews who come to the Holy Temple (Kings I 8:41-43). The prophet Isaiah refers to the Temple as a \"House for all nations.\" \n \n The Temple service during Sukkot featured 70 bull offerings, corresponding to the 70 nations of the world. The Talmud says that if the Romans would have realized how much benefit they were getting from the Temple, they'd never have destroyed it.\n \n Jews have never actively sought converts to Judaism because the Torah prescribes a righteous path for gentiles to follow, known as the \"Seven Laws of Noah.\" Maimonides explains that any human being who faithfully observes these basic moral laws earns a proper place in heaven. \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n 7) BRINGING THE MESSIAH\n \n Maimonides states that the popularity of Christianity (and Islam) is part of God's plan to spread the ideals of Torah throughout the world. This moves society closer to a perfected state of morality and toward a greater understanding of God. All this is in preparation for the Messianic age.\n \n Indeed, the world is in desperate need of Messianic redemption. War and pollution threaten our planet; ego and confusion erode family life. To the extent we are aware of the problems of society, is the extent we will yearn for redemption. As the Talmud says, one of the first questions a Jew is asked on Judgment Day is: \"Did you yearn for the arrival of the Messiah?\" \n \n How can we hasten the coming of the Messiah? The best way is to love all humanity generously, to keep the mitzvot of the Torah (as best we can), and to encourage others to do so as well. \n \n Despite the gloom, the world does seem headed toward redemption. One apparent sign is that the Jewish people have returned to the Land of Israel and made it bloom again. Additionally, a major movement is afoot of young Jews returning to Torah tradition. \n \n The Messiah can come at any moment, and it all depends on our actions. God is ready when we are. For as King David says: \"Redemption will come today -- if you hearken to His voice.\" \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n For further study, read: \n \n \"The Real Messiah,\" by Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan\n \"The Path of the Righteous Gentile,\" by Chaim Clorfene and Yakov Rogalsky\n \"The Seven Colors of the Rainbow,\" by Rabbi Yirmeyahu Bindman",

The prophet Isaiah refers to the Temple as a \"House for all nations.\" \n \n The Temple service during Sukkot featured 70 bull offerings, corresponding to the 70 nations of the world. The Talmud says that if the Romans would have realized how much benefit they were getting from the Temple, they'd never have destroyed it.\n \n Jews have never actively sought converts to Judaism because the Torah prescribes a righteous path for gentiles to follow, known as the \"Seven Laws of Noah.\" Maimonides explains that any human being who faithfully observes these basic moral laws earns a proper place in heaven. \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n 7) BRINGING THE MESSIAH\n \n Maimonides states that the popularity of Christianity (and Islam) is part of God's plan to spread the ideals of Torah throughout the world. This moves society closer to a perfected state of morality and toward a greater understanding of God. All this is in preparation for the Messianic age.\n \n Indeed, the world is in desperate need of Messianic redemption. War and pollution threaten our planet; ego and confusion erode family life. To the extent we are aware of the problems of society, is the extent we will yearn for redemption. As the Talmud says, one of the first questions a Jew is asked on Judgment Day is: \"Did you yearn for the arrival of the Messiah?\" \n \n How can we hasten the coming of the Messiah? The best way is to love all humanity generously, to keep the mitzvot of the Torah (as best we can), and to encourage others to do so as well. \n \n Despite the gloom, the world does seem headed toward redemption. One apparent sign is that the Jewish people have returned to the Land of Israel and made it bloom again. Additionally, a major movement is afoot of young Jews returning to Torah tradition. \n \n The Messiah can come at any moment, and it all depends on our actions. God is ready when we are. For as King David says: \"Redemption will come today -- if you hearken to His voice.\" \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n For further study, read: \n \n \"The Real Messiah,\" by Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan\n \"The Path of the Righteous Gentile,\" by Chaim Clorfene and Yakov Rogalsky\n \"The Seven Colors of the Rainbow,\" by Rabbi Yirmeyahu Bindman\n\n \n There are astronomical holes in these arguments. Not sure if you yourself believe these Jewish reasons why Jesus can't be the Messiah, but they're inaccurate anyway. For instance, saying Jesus didn't fulfill all the Messianic prophecies is a stunted and disengenuous argument because the remainder of the Messianic prophecies not already fulfilled are expected to be fulfilled during Jesus' 2nd Advent. Jews for Judaism, etc., always seems not to mention this little dagger in their theory.\n \n Regarding Isaiah 53, numerous ancient Jewish Rabbis are on record as stating that this prophecy was Messianic.\n \n Regarding the Shema - \"Hear O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is ONE\" (Deut. 6:4)\": \n \n In Hebrew it reads, \"Shema Yisrael Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.\" The word Shema is the first Hebrew word in the passage and means \"hear.\" At first glance this seems to support the Jewish concept of a monotheistic God. However, a careful examination of Deuteronomy 6:4 actually establishes a credible argument for the plurality of God. Here's why. The last word of the Shema verse is echad, which is translated into English as the word \"one.\" This is what is often known as a compound-unity noun - that is to say, a noun which in many cases (see examples below) demonstrates oneness or unity, but at the same time contains two or more entities. A number of scriptural examples will help make the point.\n \n Genesis 2:24, speaking of the union of Adam and Eve, reads: \"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become ONE flesh.\" Here, the Hebrew word that is used for \"one\" (one flesh) is the same word for \"one\" that is found in the Shema verse - echad. It clearly speaks of the unity of more than one person into a united, or singular, entity.\n \n In Genesis 1:5, Moses used this same word when he described the first day of creation: \"And God called the light day, and the darkness He called night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.\" This \"one\" day, or \"first\" day is the Hebrew word echad. The one day referred to was comprised of both light and darkness - evening and morning.\n \n And still another example is found in Jeremiah 32, verses 38-39 which reads, \"And they shall be my people, and I will be their God; And I will give THEM ONE HEART.\" Here, the many people are given \"one\" (echad) heart. A unity of two or more individuals into oneness.\n \n Interestingly, however, there is another Hebrew word which signifies an absolute oneness, or singleness. That word is yachid. It is found in such scriptures as Genesis 22:2 (only son - one son), in Proverbs 4:3, in Judges 11:34, in Jeremiah 6:26, Amos 8:10, and in Zechariah 12:10 - \"....and they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for an only son.\" But it is not used in the Shema!! So considering that the Old Testament is the inspired word of God, Jehovah had a choice of using a word that implies strict singularity (yachid), or plurality in oneness (echad). Hence, the Shema verse, at best, does not in any way exclude a Triune God. \n \n I could go on, but I have other posts to read / respond to.\n \n Jesus is Lord!",

   "People who care about matters of truth don't need to hide anything.\n \n If I remember correctly, we have gotten onto this line of discussion because I claimed that Christians don't care about Jesus or what he had to say. We can argue and interpret the bible all day to try to figure out whether the Romans manipulated the words of Jesus or not, that all seems pretty futile to me.\n \n The fact of the matter though, is that people who genuinely care about what Jesus said are able to study ALL of the historical documents available, and come to a limited but reasonable understanding of who he was. These people know that Jesus was a philosopher who's ideas were developed from the philosophers of his time, and those that came before him, and they know that his ideas affected people and that he developed a devote following of people to whom he was a legend and a god, because he came to them in a time when needed something like that.\n \n Christians, however, do not study all of the available facts about Jesus. They study only the documents about Jesus that have been approved by political authorities, political authorities who, by no coincidence, made Jesus a part of their authority during times when Jesus was a threat to it. Consequently, these authorities did not take up Jesus word because they were moved by it, but rather because they needed to in order to maintain their power. And conveniently, Jesus' word was so poorly recorded, in so many different accounts, that they were able to construct something that worked for them from all of the various things available. \n \n Basically the result is that the bible is a collection of perverted and distorted documents contrived by people with an agenda that had nothing to do with Jesus, and thus, the bible has nothing to do with Jesus.\n \n Answer me this, religious person: if you are so damned interested in Jesus, enough to base your life upon his words, then why don't you put some effort into doing your own original research on him and explore sources other than the church? I mean, considering that the Church is such a controversial source of information about Jesus, and considering that their power resting on what they say about him creates a huge conflict of interest, doesn't it make sense to be open to what people who have nothing to loose have to say about Jesus, or even just to study for yourself the actual documents left over from the time?",

It's a head scratcher and you all help keep me out of church. Especially EZ - he's special. The way he throws around Bible verses, quickly followed by insults for anyone who may not share his view points - whew - loving Christian men like that - who needs Satan? Whatever logic he may or may not posess is lost in his meaness. \n \n Anyway - I simply found what I originally responded to amusing. Something about those words in a religion debate forum. What is arguing religion if not \"Simply stating people are wrong claiming no context although providing none, using prejudicial comments, claiming bias etc. Never analysis. Never actual evidence.\" My reaction is probably out of context of your arguments. Just ignore me.\n\n \n fair enough. HOwever amusing you may find it, you assume to much. You assumed that someone was trying to prove the existence of or know the mind of God. At this time that claim was not made. What was made was a claim on analysis of a particular religious document. You may not see the point in those and I am sorry if it keeps you from the church (likely as not a bowl of milk would keep you from the church given that your mind is made up already). Do you not also see the point of argument of things such as \"what is good\" \"what is wisdom\", \"what is truth\" and other philosophical arguments.\n \n These have been around a long long long time. As have the arguments in this thread. I personally would never claim to know fully the mind of God. I would claim that God revealed himself to the world through the bible and through Jesus. I cannot prove either. There exists evidence on both sides of the fence. Neither are provable. \n \n My argumentation rarely seeks to prove a point of faith. It is almost always a point of reality. Trebor just throws out his own agenda and opinion and never backs anything up. It is just frustrating to continually debate with someone (remember this is a debate forum) who does not really debate.\n \n I have no problems with your comments, they are just not debate.

   "http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/16/opinion/16sat2.html\n \n September 16, 2006\n Editorial\n The Pope's Words \n There is more than enough religious anger in the world. So it is particularly disturbing that Pope Benedict XVI has insulted Muslims, quoting a 14th-century description of Islam as \"evil and inhuman.\" \n \n In the most provocative part of a speech this week on \"faith and reason,\" the pontiff recounted a conversation between an \"erudite\" Byzantine Christian emperor and a \"learned\" Muslim Persian circa 1391. The pope quoted the emperor saying, \"Show me just what Muhammad brought that was new, and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached.\"\n \n Muslim leaders the world over have demanded apologies and threatened to recall their ambassadors from the Vatican, warning that the pope's words dangerously reinforce a false and biased view of Islam. For many Muslims, holy war - jihad - is a spiritual struggle, and not a call to violence. And they denounce its perversion by extremists, who use jihad to justify murder and terrorism. \n \n The Vatican issued a statement saying that Benedict meant no offense and in fact desired dialogue. But this is not the first time the pope has fomented discord between Christians and Muslims. \n \n In 2004 when he was still the Vatican's top theologian, he spoke out against Turkey's joining the European Union, because Turkey, as a Muslim country was \"in permanent contrast to Europe.\"\n \n A doctrinal conservative, his greatest fear appears to be the loss of a uniform Catholic identity, not exactly the best jumping-off point for tolerance or interfaith dialogue. \n \n The world listens carefully to the words of any pope. And it is tragic and dangerous when one sows pain, either deliberately or carelessly. He needs to offer a deep and persuasive apology, demonstrating that words can also heal.",

   "http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/16/us/16beliefs.html\n \n September 16, 2006\n Beliefs \n By PETER STEINFELS\n Held together by a large black clip, the pages were jammed in a corner of a top shelf. E-mailed on Dec. 3, 2001, by an editor at the Eerdmans Publishing Company, they were the printed-out page proofs of a small book, \"Writing in the Dust,\" reflecting on what the author had experienced a few months earlier on Sept. 11. \n \n The author was Rowan Williams, then Anglican Archbishop of Wales and today the Archbishop of Canterbury. When the planes hit the World Trade Center, he was in Manhattan, about to videotape a discussion at 74 Trinity Place. The building, which houses Trinity Church's offices, stood between that famous Episcopal church, at Broadway and Wall Street, and the trade center. \n \n Trapped in the building, choking on smoke and fumes, the archbishop and many people with him seriously pondered the possibility that they were about to die. In the moments after the second plane hit, as one person present recalled, \"he read the anxieties of the group and prayed them into words, naming our fears and calming our nerves.\" \n \n The next day the archbishop led an impromptu service in the Cathedral of St. John the Divine on Morningside Heights and, speaking from notes, delivered a fully developed but completely different lecture than the prepared text he had come to New York to give. \n \n Impressive, yes, and on the first anniversary of Sept. 11, this column reported Archbishop Williams's moving thoughts on the limits of language in dealing with God and tragedy. But in December 2001 the page proofs of that little book still did not escape skeptical scrutiny. Rereading them this week, this writer found the margins peppered not only with his many appreciative checks and exclamation points - but also question marks and some serious grumbling. \n \n The archbishop's confidence that terror could be dealt with by international policing rather than military means, for example, provoked some pained scribbles - even a single \"yuck,\" which, in this personal system of marginal notes, ranks just below \"ugh.\" \n \n \"Writing in the Dust\" is a subtle interweaving of themes, many dealing with language. The religious language that the terrorists used to justify their acts. The final messages of doomed victims to loved ones. The language of violence. Think how often, Archbishop Williams reminded readers, one hears, \"It's the only language they understand.\" \n \n The author noted the volleying back and forth of clich\u00e9s about terrorism's roots in poverty and helplessness and the reflexive rebuttals, whether about Osama bin Laden's wealth, apocalyptic nihilism or hatred of the American way of life. There was a warning about the consequences of choosing the labels \"war\" and \"war against terrorism\" for a struggle that departs sharply from classic notions of war and in which it is not clear what can count as a conclusive victory. The author also warned against the use of language about suffering to make pious points, to translate suffering into ideology or self-justification, to reduce other people to symbols in one's own stories rather than acknowledging how they see themselves. \n \n The book, in sum, was a plea for \"language that brings into the world something other than self-defensiveness,\" language - or maybe silence - that creates (and the author knew from being on the scene how paradoxical was this chosen image) a \"breathing space.\" \n \n In an epilogue, Archbishop Williams offered three reasons for calling his book \"Writing in the Dust.\" \n \n \"The obvious one,\" he wrote, was \"the sheer physical recollection of that dense gray atmosphere in the streets, the soft fall of ash and paper, the gritty eye-stinging wind.\"\n \n The second was an awareness that \"these words won't last.\" He did not consider his reflections \"a theology or a program for action, but one person's attempt to find words for the grief and shock and loss of one moment.\" \n \n The third stemmed from the story of Jesus and the woman taken in adultery found in Chapter 8 of John's Gospel. When the accused woman is brought to Jesus for judgment, he seems not to hear but merely writes with his finger on the ground. \n \n (More)",

   "\"What on earth is he doing?\" the archbishop asked. \"Commentators have had plenty of suggestions,\" he wrote, but in light of Sept. 11 one meaning strikes him as obvious. Jesus hesitates. \"He allows a moment, a longish moment, in which people are given time to see themselves differently precisely because he refuses to make the sense they want.\" \n \n \"So this is writing in the dust,\" Archbishop Williams concluded, \"because it tries to hold that moment for a little longer, long enough for some of our demons to walk away.\" \n \n Although the war in Afghanistan had begun before the archbishop finished his book, and he did not condemn it there, it was clearly not in keeping with his plea for a \"longish moment.\" Perhaps that explained some of the impatient marginal comments encountered this week. \n \n Others were reacting to a tone that seemed scolding or superior or elevated above political realities. Still, from the perspective of five years, the archbishop's case for a longish moment to breathe deeply, to see things differently and to let some of our demons walk away looks increasingly wise. \n \n On Monday, the archbishop spoke on the BBC of the trauma of five years ago. He described a recent conversation with a senior Israeli rabbi about the bloody events in Lebanon. \"The rabbi,\" Archbishop Williams told his audience, \"made no political points. But he said that when in the Bible God tells Moses to take off his shoes in the divine presence, the Jewish sages had interpreted this to mean that we couldn't meet God if we were protected against the uneven and unyielding and perhaps stony or thorny ground.\"\n \n The rabbi considered this also true \"when we meet the human beings who are made in God's image,\" Archbishop Williams said. \"Those who are responsible for violence of any kind, even when they think it is in a just cause, need to take off their shoes and recognize what it is like when flesh and blood are hurt.\"\n \n \"Terrorism,\" he concluded, \"is the absolute negation of any such recognition,\" and what will defeat terrorism in the end \"is 'taking off our shoes,' coming to terms with what we share as mortal beings who have immortal value.\"",

   "Patriarchal Religions\n \n \nItalian Nun Killed in Somalia\n Associated Press\n September 17, 2006 9:15 a.m.\n MOGADISHU, Somalia -- An Italian nun was shot dead at a hospital by Somali gunmen Sunday, hours after a leading Muslim cleric condemned Pope Benedict XVI for his remarks on Islam and violence.\n \n The nun, who wasn't immediately identified, was shot in the back at S.O.S. Hospital in northern Mogadishu by two gunmen, said Mohamed Yusuf, a doctor at the facility, which serves mothers and children. The nun's bodyguard and a hospital worker were also killed, doctors said.\n \n There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, and it wasn't clear if it was directly linked to the pope's comments. Two people had been arrested, said Yusuf Mohamed Siad, head of security for the Islamic militia that controls Mogadishu.\n \n Earlier Sunday, a Somali cleric criticized the comments the pope made in a speech last week for offending Muslims. The pope had cited the words of a Byzantine emperor who characterized some of the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad, Islam's founder, as \"evil and inhuman.\"\n \n \"The pope's statement at this time was not only wrong but irresponsible as well,\" said Sheik Nor Barud, deputy leader of the Somali Muslim Scholars Association.\n \n \"Both the Pope and the Byzantine Emperor he quoted are ignorant of Islam and it is noble Prophet,\" he told journalists at a news conference in the capital Mogadishu.\n \n In Rome, Vatican spokesman Rev. Federico Lombardi called the nun's slaying \"a horrible episode,\" the Italian news agency ANSA said. \"Let's hope that it will be an isolated fact.\" Rev. Lombardi indicated the shooting could be related to the uproar over the pope's remarks.\n \n \"We are following with concern the consequences of this wave of hate, hoping that it does not lead to grave consequences for the church in the world,\" he was quoted as saying.\n \n The pope apologized earlier Sunday for the angry reaction to his remarks, which he said came from a text that didn't reflect his personal opinion.\n \n Witnesses also said the shooting and the pope's comments appeared to be linked. \"These gunmen always look for white people to kill, and now the pope gave them the reason to do their worst,\" said Mohamud Durguf Derow, who was at the scene when the nun was killed.\n \n The nun, who spoke fluent Somali, was believed to be around 60 and had been working at the hospital since 2002, said witnesses at the hospital on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.\n \n Somalia has been without an effective central government since warlords overthrew its longtime dictator in 1991 and divided the nation into fiefdoms. The Islamic fundamentalists have stepped into the vacuum as an alternative military and political power.\n \n The current interim government was established two years ago with the support of the United Nations, but has failed to assert any power outside its base in Baidoa, 150 miles from Mogadishu.\n \n The Islamic group, which seized the capital and much of southern Somalia this summer, is credited with bringing a semblance of order to the country after years of anarchy, but some of its leaders have been linked to al Qaeda and there are fears of an emerging Taliban-style regime.\nI hope that the name of this woman will be revealed so that we can remember her as a martyr because of the devilish beliefs of patriarchal religions. It is interesting to note that the cowardly men of religion shot her in the back.\n \n Ptah! upon your wretched patriarchal gods of dissension!",

   "I see religion as an obstacle to peace on a number of levels.\n \n Like countries, religions lumps people together and make it easy for the many to be judged based on the actions of the few. This alone causes all kinds of problems. However, unlike a country, the leadership of a religion has very little power to actually do anything about the misbehaviour of some of its citizens. Wringing their hands and distancing themselves is about the best they can hope for, and even that can be problematic if tensions are running high. Religious leaders can easily find themselves in an impossible position: denouncing violence will only see them deposed or ignored in favour of those who don't denounce it.\n \n This difficulty arises because religions are charismatic organisations, founded upon the principle of emotional fervour superceding reason. Their leaders are no more in control than the man who whips a mob into a frenzy and briefly surfs its momentum. It is the mood of the followers that ultimately dictates the direction of a religion, and the same fervour that binds them together makes that mood volatile indeed.\n \n So religions make peace harder to regain once violence is abroad. That alone is sufficient obstacle, when simple human nature makes violence inevitable. But there is more.\n \n Religions gather followers indiscriminately. They preach however and whatever they see fit, to anyone who'll listen, regardless of any slant poor communication by the teacher, or a listeners' emotional and psychological state might apply - yet religions accept no responsibility, and are not investigated or held accountable for the actions of those who choose to 'misinterpret' god's word. Moreover, religions prefer to indoctrinate followers during childhood or infancy before critical thought has a chance to establish itself. This is good for the religion's chances of ensuring its continuation, but very bad for the individual's chances of rationally correcting any misconceptions he might be harbouring. This 'grooming' of children is the most distastefully overt expression of the parasitic-meme nature of religion.\n \n Then there's the primary tenet of most religions: that a little suffering or privation here on earth is irrelevant compared to the eternity of bliss or torment that awaits us beyond. I see teaching that as breathtakingly irresponsible, so short a leap is it from there to believing the same about a little suffering or privation for someone else.\n \n It just goes on and on. Is religion an obstacle to world peace? Turn on your TV, and you'll see Mr Bush telling everyone that the same god who coined the phrase 'turn the other cheek' now wants him to blast apart or burn alive tens of thousands of Iraqi children in revenge for a Saudi act of terrorism - and worse, look out of your window and you'll see people who believe him, because their emotional attachment to their religion, or the religion that Bush wants America itself to become (guided by emotion rather than reason, with doubters or dissenters treated as heretics), is greater than their ability to empathise with another human being. Without religion - or more precisely, without religious thinking - who could possibly drop a thousand pound bomb into a crowded city and see it as anything more noble or forgivable than crashing a passenger jet?\n \n In my opinion there is no greater single obstacle to world peace than religion.",

   "Thel and Simone: You have both posted some interesting accusations, such as, simopne, that bush never talked to anyone in the military.

Talk. Youhave not posted a single item to support either position. \n \n To say that bush did not know about the three factions (suni, shia, kurd) is ridiculous on its face. To say that you did not know it is equally ridiculous for one who has \"studied\" that region. I knew this from a long long time ago from the time when Iraq invaded kuwait in an \"oil grab\". We beat the heck out of them then. The only problem with that war was that we stopped short and did not finish the job. The dictator of Iraq then used chemical weapons on the kurds and the shia. HIS OWN PEOPLE!\n \n To claim that bush did not know anything is simply silly. You offer no evidence and in fact there is tons of evidence to the contrary. The white house holds military briefings regularly even when we are not at war. The intelligence was clear to everyone that Iraq continued to develop weapons of mass destruction.\n \n The liberal favorite, Clinton, believed this. Check out the clinton library for info on iraq if you don't believe me. John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, Joe Lieberman, etc. They all believed it and the believed it long before Bush ever took office. Check out the congressional record for documents on the last show down with Saddam when clinton chose to shoot missles into Bagdhad for non compliance with UN inspectors. That was Clinton not Bush.\n \n Everyone thought he had what he had and it was before Bush took office. He operated on the same information that they were operating on.

Bush was unaware that there were two major sects of Islam just two months before the President ordered troops to invade Iraq, RAW STORY has learned. \n \n In his new book, The End of Iraq: How American Incompetence Created A War Without End, Galbraith, the son of the late economist John Kenneth Galbraith, claims that American leadership knew very little about the nature of Iraqi society and the problems it would face after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. \n \n A year after his \"Axis of Evil\" speech before the U.S. Congress, President Bush met with three Iraqi Americans, one of whom became postwar Iraq's first representative to the United States. The three described what they thought would be the political situation after the fall of Saddam Hussein. During their conversation with the President, Galbraith claims, it became apparent to them that Bush was unfamiliar with the distinction between Sunnis and Shiites. \n \n Galbraith reports that the three of them spent some time explaining to Bush that there are two different sects in Islam--to which the President allegedly responded, \"I thought the Iraqis were Muslims!\"\n \n Research by RAW STORY has confirmed a surprising lack of public statements from the president regarding the branches of Islam, but did uncover at least one mention of their existence. A fact sheet released by the White House in December of 2001 does indeed use the term Sunni to describe a Lashkar-E-Tayyib, \"the armed wing of the Pakistan-based religious organization, Markaz-ud-Dawa-wal-Irshad.\" Other mentions, not originating from the White House, were common in government documents and proceedings, as well as in media coverage of the middle east.\n \n Other reports also place Bush announcing newfound knowledge of the differences between Muslim groups shortly before entering the Iraq war.\n \n In an interview with RAW STORY, Ambassador Galbraith recounted this anecdote from his book to exemplify \"a culture of arrogance that pervaded the whole administration.\"\n \n \"From the president and the vice president down through the neoconservatives at the Pentagon, there was a belief that Iraq was a blank slate on which the United States could impose its vision of a pluralistic democratic society,\" said Galbraith. \"The arrogance came in the form of a belief that this could be accomplished with minimal effort and planning by the United States and that it was not important to know something about Iraq.\"\n \n The Bush Administration's aims when it invaded Iraq in March 2003 were to bring it democracy and transform the Middle East. Instead, Iraq has reverted to its three constituent components: a pro-western Kurdistan, an Iran-dominated Shiite theocracy in the south, and a chaotic Sunni Arab region in the center. \n \n Galbraith argues that because the new Iraq was never a voluntary creation of its people--but rather held together by force--America's ongoing attempt to preserve a unified nation is guaranteed to fail, especially since it's divided into three different entities. \n \n \"You can't have a national unity government when there is no nation, no unity, and no government,\" said Galbraith. \"Rather than trying to preserve or hold together a unified Iraq, the U.S. must accept the reality of Iraq's breakup and work with the Shiites, Kurds, and Sunni Arabs to strengthen the already semi-independent regions.\"\n \n Galbraith further argues that the invasion of Iraq destabilized the Middle East while inadvertently strengthening Iran. One of the administration's intentions in invading Iraq was to undermine Iran, but instead, the Iraqi occupation has given Tehran one of its greatest strategic triumphs in the last four centuries. \n \n Once considered to be Iraq's worst enemy, Iran has now created, financed and armed the Shiite Islamic movements within southern Iraq. Since the Iraqi Parliamentary elections of 2005, the Shiites have made considerable political gains and now have substantial influence over the country's U.S.-created military, its police, and the central government in Baghdad. In addition, Iraq is developing economic ties with Iran that Galbraith believes could soon link the two countries' strategic oil supplies. \n \n Galbraith says that, \"thanks to George W. Bush, Iran today has no closer ally in the world than the Iraq of the Ayatollahs.\" As a result, he argues, sending U.S. forces into Iraq, has in effect, made them hostage to Iran and its Iraqi Shiite allies and left the U.S. without a viable military option to halt Iran's drive to obtain nuclear weapons. \n \n A seasoned diplomat, Galbraith served as the first U.S. ambassador to Croatia, where he negotiated the 1995 Erdut Agreement that ended the Croatian war. \n \n Galbraith fears the United States may have lost the war on the very day it took Baghdad. \"The American servicemen and women who took Baghdad were professionals--disciplined, courteous, and task-oriented,\" said Galbraith. \"Unfortunately, their political masters were so focused on making the case for war, so keen to vanquish their political foes at home, felt certain that Iraqis would embrace American-style democracy, yet they were so blinded by their own ideology that they failed to plan for the most obvious tasks following military victory.\" \n \n Galbraith believes that the Bush Administration's effort will only leave the U.S. with an open-ended commitment in circumstances of uncontrollable turmoil. In the end, he believes, America's most important objective is to avoid a worsening civil war. \n \n \"There is no easy exit from Iraq,\" said Galbraith. \"The alternative, however is to continue the present strategy of trying to build national institutions-displaced in the 2003 invasion-but how can you do that where this now is no longer an existing nation?\"",

Once again Simone, you have looked at assertions made with no support. \n \n Here is another one from shortly after the invasion:\n \n \nWhether you're Sunni or Shia or Kurd or Chaldean or Assyrian or Turkoman or Christian or Jew or Muslim -- (applause) -- no matter what your faith, freedom is God's gift to every person in every nation. (Applause.) As freedom takes hold in Iraq, the Iraqi people will choose their own leaders and their own government. America has no intention of imposing our form of government or our culture. Yet, we will ensure that all Iraqis have a voice in the new government and all citizens have their rights protected. (Applause.) \n source: speech april 28, 2003\n http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2003/04/20030428-3.html\n \n\n \n These are Bush's direct remarks. This does not even count the innumberable press briefings and gaggles coming from the administration. He does not have to know everything. This is why he has a cabinet and listens to the military commanders and the same intelligence that caused Clinton, Clinton, kerry, Lieberman, etc. to believe that it was necessary to invade. The information was there in the Clinton Library (inspite of a nameless individual caught stealing info). I note you did not address that Bush was actually proceeding in the logical steps of the Clinton administration. Look at the call for Saddam's ouster by democratic senators prior to the bush administration.\n \n You simply cannot win this argument.\n \n EF",

Do you think they support it because they know it will rid the world of terrorism? NO!! They support it because they know that they will win.

So in a sense that element is not separate. An individual may reject the ethics in which case they have achieved a separation.\n \n The other is the religious element with regards to God and creation. That alway is there whether or not man exists. So yes that is/can be separate.\n \n My own thoughts are that we are on this world with words of guidance if you like and free will. What we do is up to us. We have to answer for what we do in the end tho'.\n \n So Religion as a whole is an element which can stand alone but with which man can react.

Your statement there requires the violent intent to start with the people to begin with, in order to require some excuse.\n\n Indeed. I've been trying to make the point - and I accept that the fault may be with my clarity of expression - that religion evolved in early societies with many purely pragmatic and secular functions, none of which need have been apprehended by its practitioners but which increased the society's survival prospects nonetheless. One of these functions, I suggest, was providing justification / sanctification for otherwise questionable or troubling courses of action. Yes, this view 'requires the violent intent to start with the people', but that is hardly a problem for my argument: historically, intra- and inter-societal violence has been the norm, not the exception. Religion is a way of raising inter-societal violence that is useful to the group to the level of holy obligation - a very useful spin-off indeed.\n \n \nAlso, why would you be using the account in Numbers when you don't believe there was a God to tell them to carry out the killing of the Medianites?\n\n It was not necessary that the commandment come from a real god; for the Israelites to benefit from their religion's whitewashing effect it was sufficient that they believed it did. This is true of all religions' adaptive functions: I have no doubt the Aztecs' religion made their society far more cohesive and purposeful than they would have been without it, but I don't have to believe in Quetzalcoatl to hold that view.",

Religion as a rule not only reinforces this maladaptive tendency but in many cases actually sanctifies it.\n \n Clearly I'm viewing religion as an evolved trait in humankind, intrinsic to our brains and cultures, without any necessary external validity or truth: it is the process of believing and sharing belief, not the thing or ideas believed in, that confers the survival value. (This view will not be yours, of course.) If I believed that religion could easily be expunged from the human psyche I'd hope fervently for that to happen; but I don't.

I do not believe some of what you are saying, you are correct. \n \n However, tolerance and cooperation are not far enough. While they are good results, they are only results and not the source for what is needed. People must truly be able to forgive. Because of this inherent nature that we have, we will continue to hurt each other. Forgiveness is one of the most powerful tools we have. My opinion is that Forgiveness is found only with Christ. However, that is my opinion. I believe it to be true, but I also believe that it is not my job to force others to believe that way. Forcing belief is wrong. It achieves nothing.\n \n Thanks for the discourse.\n \n EF",

Hypothetically, if a particular religion were intrinsically blameless but still tragically susceptible to misinterpretation, responsibility for ensuring its message was delivered and understood correctly - and that it was not taught to someone incapable of 'handling it' - would still weigh on the shoulders of its teachers and leaders every bit as heavily as if they were passing out firearms. \n \n 2. If 'rogue' teachers are miscommunicating the virtuous message of a religion, it is incumbent upon the mainstream to publicly and unanimously denounce those teachers as non-christian/muslim/jewish/etc. At this point we have a schism and one religion becomes two. Since a religion consists of - literally is - its teachings and beliefs, at least one of these two religions is now intrinsically harmful.\n \n 3. In reality, religions are never unblemished. The 'holy texts' of all three mainstream monotheistic religions remain littered with absolutely appalling - to our modern morality - exhortations to (and 'virtuous' examples of) atrocity and intolerance, ripe and ready to be raised to undue (as religious apologists would have it) prominence. Why are these passages not expunged? If a religion is supposed to be an absolute and divine moral guiding hand, why do readers have to apply their own personal moral filter to extract the 'correct' lessons and 'correct' interpretations from it? And if anyone here dares suggest that this process is some kind of ultimate 'test' deliberately manufactured by their imaginary deity, he is frankly being obtuse. A moral guidebook written in code? With tricks and traps to turn you into a human bomb or war criminal if you get it wrong? You're saying that back in the days when we stuck closer to the actual letter of these books and really did stone our grannies to death for crimes of fashion, we were being less virtuous than today, when we pick and choose which bits to take seriously? How screwed up is this maniacal deity of yours? \n \n 4. To say that religion only becomes dangerous when someone believes in it is every bit as foolish as saying that a virus is only dangerous when someone contracts it. Strictly true, yet it says nothing useful at all. A virus is not a complete organism; not even technically alive as such, yet the combination of a virus and a living organism is extremely successful at making more virus (and sometimes a dead organism), and quite often more infected organisms. Blaming individuals for actions carried out under the influence of a religious meme is as silly as blaming individuals for dying from a viral infection. After all, it was their cells that replicated the virus; clearly it was all their fault!\n \n 5. As I have pointed out many times before, a prerequisite for any mind's acceptance of religious drivel is the installation of the belief that faith is intrinsically virtuous; that it's ok - indeed good - to wall off certain ideas against rational enquiry. To hobble a mind thus is inherently dangerous, in that it vastly increases the risk that your victim will later adopt - and fail to adequately question - actively harmful beliefs.\n \n 6. Religions teach that there are such things as 'moral absolutes', and that they are somehow superior to - no, not moral relativity, as some would insist is the only alternative - but our innate* consequentalist morality. Quite why or how it is better to adopt an utterly unbending stance on an issue rather than considering the consequences has never been adequately explained, especially when faith and absolute morality are both required ingredients for the production of suicide bombers and lunatic presidents alike**.\n \n I apologise for skipping over the whole 'orifice' detour this thread latterly endured, but my time is unfortunately limited :)\n \n *Humankind's innate, Darwinian morality has been convincingly demonstrated. Reasoning that any such morality would logically span religious and geographic divides, researchers conducted 'moral dilemma' tests across the globe and found a high degree of correlation between the results. With depressing predictability, it has also been shown that identical groups of children from the same faith exhibit polar opposite reactions to a description of an act of violence and genocide depending upon whether it is reproduced verbatim from their religious literature or presented anonymously, stripped of its recognisable religious markers. It isn't hard to see why this might be: our increasingly populous and latterly globalized society naturally tends to favour those who assume other people belong to 'their' group rather than 'another'. Thus modern children, faced with the tale of an abhorrent act, instinctively react as if it was happening to members of their 'in-group', even if the victims in the tale are explicitly described as living on the far side of the planet. Religion has the power to shift the victims into the 'out-group' category, in which the terrible suffering is of less consequence.\n \n ** It is arguable that 'immovability as a virtue' arose as a corruption of our evolved, and very successful, tribal \"over-commitment\" strategy. Given otherwise equal tribes, one whose members 'have each others backs' utterly and unreservedly no matter what will reliably trounce a tribe of bean-counters who only co-operate so long as it is in their individual best interests. The truth of this does not require any moralistic deity helping things along; it simply emerges from the fact that no single member of a tribe can ever know everything all the others know, which means a member of an 'over-committed' tribe can act with confidence while a 'bean-counter' must always hedge his bets. Hence the (logically reprehensible) tendency of the electorate to favour a leader with 'strong principles' over one who changes his mind when new facts emerge: we have not yet accepted, on a 'gut' level, that \"I will always act in your best interests whatever the situation\" ought to reassure us more than \"I will always act the same whatever the situation\".",

So you really do blame the sufferer for what the virus causes his body to do to itself - interesting.\n \n \nThe basic teachings of our Lord as epitomised in his two great commandments I would have difficulty in finding fault with. Perhaps you can. if so let us debate them.\n\n \n You persist in avoiding the issue. Were we to debate these 'two great commandments' we would not be debating christianity. We would be debating the parts of christianity that happen to resonate with your personal experiences and innate Darwinian morality. Look in your holy book for peace and love, and you will find it. Look there for violence, intolerance and genocide, and you will find that too. As a moral guide it is no better than a tarnished mirror.\n \n \nIf they are good as a way of belief, then every letter to whomsoever, every preacher, every teacher will have interpreted the teachings. Many will be good and honest, many will be extreme, many will be political. That is their responsibility as it is for each of us.\n \n Religion is both a blessing and a curse. Blessing in its teachings and a curse in how people construe it for their own ends\n\n \n This all sounds terribly profound until you consider what a religious manual for assembling flat-pack furniture would be like. You might end up with a bookshelf, or a guillotine - it all depends how you choose to read it!\n \n Your argument is unsupportably silly. The bible, or torah, or koran, is either an effective moral guidebook or it's not. Evidence indicates that all it achieves over and above modern, evolved morality is to weigh people down with meaningless rituals and restrictions which they follow for no better reason than to enjoy feeling righteous or to please their parents, narrow our (wonderfully, globally) expanded concept of what 'in-group' can mean, and regularly inspire individuals and mobs to violence and hatred should anyone dare to point out just how silly the whole thing is. \n \n Moreover, in our modern world in which the decline of faith is often lamented, we nevertheless behave far better, in general, towards people of other ethnicities and geographical location - and are more considerate of their needs and care more about their welfare - than at any time in the deeply religious past. We have progressed, morally, despite religion, not because of it, as evidenced by your modern, selective interpretation of an ancient text that was once followed slavishly.\n \n But let's look at it yet another way. Nobody blows anyone up for saying, publicly, 'evolution is stupid and wrong'. Rather, the speaker is directed towards the evidence (or possibly the door) and encouraged to reconsider. Someone could yell those words in the centre of MIT campus and suffer nothing worse than a gentle ribbing, despite them having just insulted the life's work of literally thousands of brilliant academics, many of whom would be heroes to the students there. Yet if I were to shout the same about islam (or christianity) - or insult mohammed (or jesus) in the middle of an iranian mosque (or a southern-state church), my health, if not my life, would be in serious danger.\n \n What interpretation are we to put on this fact? That religions attract violent people to a far greater degree than science? Hmm. Not a great advertisement, I think you'll agree. However, you can relax, because I don't for a moment subscribe to your notion that it is the believers themselves who are to blame. \n \n No: it is the religious meme, defending itself the only way it can. Evolutionists don't blow up creationists because they know they're right in a way that makes faith - and the emotional attachment that entails - irrelevant. We could destroy every machine, burn every science book, murder every scientist - and in a few thousand years, our (justifiably irritated and probably quite hungry) descendents would have discovered the exact same principles and be working, once again, on genetic cures to hereditary diseases. Religion, existing as it does only in our minds, has only survived by evolving defensive mechanisms to discourage and smother dissent, and the sharp end of those defensive mechanisms are its loyal followers. A religion that engages the emotions, that can inspire at least some of its followers to great exertion or violence - even self-sacrifice - to discourage others from voicing contrary opinions, is going to outlast one that doesn't. \n \n Even you, with your avowed peaceful leanings, are here patiently explaining why I should not voice my criticisms of the meme that slumbers in your head; that attempting to instill doubt in a believer's mind is rude. Sometimes this false appeal to politeness or courtesy is enough, and the infidel falls quiet. But if it is not, your religious meme has plenty of sharper barbs at its disposal, who would have no qualms about causing me or my family financial or physical harm to silence me.\n \n It follows that even if there was a truly perfect religion, one whose teachings invariably caused its followers to follow uniformly virtuous lives, it would long ago have been trampled beneath the conquering heels of religions that don't mind a little wet work in the lord's name. It is a Darwinian inevitability. One might even go so far as to note the scriptural 'beefing up' christianity received around the time of the crusades, in response to aggressive muslim expansionism.",

It was not intended as such. It is strictly the revelation of God. \n \n 2) The bible actually does not place restrictions on people. It instead describes a holy God and His requirements for Holiness. Declares that People cannot live up to it. Then provides them the substitionary method for being Holy as a gift. A gift given a great cost.\n \n In fact, all other religions on the planet declare what man must do in order to obtain to heaven. Only The bible states that man cannot achieve this and that Heaven is offered as a gift.\n \n EF",

Look there for violence, intolerance and genocide, and you will find that too. As a moral guide it is no better than a tarnished mirror.\n\n \n So is your beef with the Bible as a whole and not religion? Or both? And I note that your take on the \"holy book\" doesn't account for the way most people in that religion interpret it. By far, the peace and love as considered the standard is the rule and the violence is the exception (to the point where it's rare in modern Christianity). You aren't taking into account that Christianity doesn't view the violent commands of the OT literally whereas it does take the commands of the NT literally. Christianity is based on the NT. Again this is yet another example of your sweeping brush painting all of Christianity the same way, and it's just flat out not accurate.\n \n \nMoreover, in our modern world in which the decline of faith is often lamented, we nevertheless behave far better, in general, towards people of other ethnicities and geographical location - and are more considerate of their needs and care more about their welfare - than at any time in the deeply religious past. We have progressed, morally, despite religion, not because of it, as evidenced by your modern, selective interpretation of an ancient text that was once followed slavishly.\n\n \n I think it's been about the same. 2 World wars, millions of Jews killed in the holocaust, etc. More have been killed in the wars of the last 100 years than in all of known history put together. A lot of that is contributable to technology, but it's still modern people that developed that destructive technology. Human nature are still very capable of destructiveness, no matter what time frame it is.\n \n \nBut let's look at it yet another way. Nobody blows anyone up for saying, publicly, 'evolution is stupid and wrong'.\n\n \n Er, I've never heard of anyone blowing up anyone for saying \"evolution is correct\" either. Have you?\n \n \n \nRather, the speaker is directed towards the evidence (or possibly the door) and encouraged to reconsider. Someone could yell those words in the centre of MIT campus and suffer nothing worse than a gentle ribbing, despite them having just insulted the life's work of literally thousands of brilliant academics, many of whom would be heroes to the students there. Yet if I were to shout the same about islam (or christianity) - or insult mohammed (or jesus) in the middle of an iranian mosque (or a southern-state church), my health, if not my life, would be in serious danger.\n\n \n Wow! I don't know about Islam, but you have some strange ideas of Christianity if you think you'd be in danger voicing those words about Jesus in a southern-state church. It just isn't that way. I'd encourage you actually visit and talk to people like this and learn what they're really like, because you really don't seem to know. I don't mean that to put you down, it's just the truth. I doubt there's a Christian southern-state church in existence where your life would be in danger if you said something like that about Jesus. I've certainly never seen or heard of one where that would be the case, and if such a church exists, it would be so uncommon as to be a non-factor in this discussion.\n \n What this means (and what I hope you come away from this with) is that there really is a difference between religions, and within religions between groups. Whether or not a religion is bad depends on the religion and how they do things. Two examples from the extremes: Obviously a relgious group that trains people to fly planes into buildings is bad. Obviously a relgious group peace-loving Tibetan monks who mind their own business up in the mountains to achieve enlightenment are not \"bad\" in any sense to society. Every religious group is different, some VERY different from each other. To sweepingly say religion is bad is just, well, an irrational way to approach things.",
