It's probable that any determined effort to locate and expel this huge number of people who have crossed the border illegally, would be condemned (by the media) as a draconian denial of human rights, or even a \"fascist\" expedient. \n \n A similar problem is faced by the UK government which, it is claimed, has lost control of the British borders and is unwilling to take the illiberal measures necessary to prevent further illegal immigration. \n \n There are no easy answers - especially in America where so many people are descended from immigrants.

If you want to combat illegal aliens you have to follow the money and attac here it is goign to matter. If what an illegal alien faces when they get to the US is no hope of obtaining a job and sleeping on the street, we will see a lot fewer of them showing up. I do not think that JUST fines is enough. I think that there needs to be some prison time for these corporate officers who are approving the hiring of thousands of these folks.\n \n I also think we need to revise our deportation procedure. Currently we pic up illegals and if they protest their deprotation they let them go pending a hearing. The ilegal alien just vanishes again. It would be far too expensive to eep them all in a proper jail pending deportation hearings. If, on the other hand, we followed the lead of cerain sheriffs in arizona and built prison camps to keep them in pending deprotation we could afford to do it and the system might actually work. I doubt there would ever bee too many people imprisoned in the camps. As soon as they realize that challenging their deportation means spending several months in a prison camp somewhere while agreeing to deportation sees them back home by the end of the week I am sure we will see a LOT fewer challenges. \n \n I also think that the guest worker program in the current bill absolutly sucks. Other nations have similar programs and they lead to rampant employee abuse. When the penalty for displeasing your employer is deportation that employer has a HUGE stick and not a whole lot of incentive to show you any consideration at all.
