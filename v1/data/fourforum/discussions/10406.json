   "I was at a bus stop this morning. There was some guy in a lawn chair at the corner with a \"Jesus saves\" poster (or something equivalent). He was chatting with another guy; his voice was loud and I heard they were having a discussion of things biblical. I proceeded to read my book, waiting for the bus.\n \n The other fellow left and the lawn chair guy started preaching. You know the spiel, that inane blather that essentially is saying the same thing over and over and over and gets no where. Not a problem, except he was speaking VERY loudly. He had this booming basso voice that was quite intrusive - I couldn't read with him shouting out not ten feet away.\n \n I approached him and said, \"Excuse me, sir, but...\" He started speaking louder, utterly ignoring me. I repeated, \"Sir, would you mind speaking more softly? I can't even read with you...\" He looked directly at me and kept up his tirade.\n \n He was clearly being very rude. Exactly the same as if someone was playing loud music. He understood he was being bothersome and clearly didn't care. He had been telling the other guy that this was \"his calling\" and he seemed to think that his caterwauling was beneficial to those within ear shot. \n \n My questions:\n What is someone like that thinking? Is he being a good Christian by being rude?\n What is the law here? When does free speech become disturbing the peace?",

   "Actually, if you really, REALLY wanted to get into it, you could check you local laws on noise levels and depending on where he's at loitering and such.\n \n Persoanlly, I'd bring a loud boom-box next time and simply crank it louder than he's yelling. But, not too loud to violate noise ordinances.\n \n Also, I don't think he has to be bothering more than one person. You can still call the police and make a report. They'll show, probably do nothing more than warn him...BUT, if it happens enough, they just migth taser him. I hear it's popular in some places to simply taser 1st and ask questions later.\n \n But, I'm about 99.9% sure that sitting in a 'lawn chair' on the corner costitutes loitering or some other public nuisance charge.",

   "Where my girlfriend lives we have a local fundie group of about 8-12 people. What they do is stand across from the Tower block and use a megaphone to denounce everyone in the local vicinity as sinners. This can go on for an hour or more, they then stop and next time they move to the next tower block. This happens almost every weekend.\n \n My girlfriend has called the police on them twice and each time the Police move them on but do nothing else. To me if that was any other group but a religious group they would be locked away as a public nuisance. For example if I started doing the same thing but instead of quoting scripture I quoted Marx I would probably rightly be told where to go by the Police.\n \n The next time I see them I may confront them and ask why they do such a thing, it would be interesting to see what kind of mindset it takes to be such a pain in the arse.",

   "Sounds to me like the guy belongs in an asylum for the mentally insane. Many of that ilk do.\n\n \n I thought he might be a run-of-the-mill psychotic, it's hard to tell with some the fundies. He seemed to be talking coherently with the other man initially, however. Later on, I think he was speaking in tongues. It sounded like gibberish, but I detected what I thought was an occasional Latin word and a tad of Spanish here and there. Maybe it was a real language.\n \n As for bothering only me, that was not the case. I soon figured out why the other half dozen folks were standing way on the other side of the bus shelter. And most of them had ipods. When I joined them, they all smiled in solidarity with me.",

   "You could do what some did to Fred Phelps when his group became annoying.\n Get some buddies to surround them and out shout them.\n \n I figure a few people with microphones of their own would be able to out-shout them for a while. \n \n The babbling was probably the charismatic version of 'toungues'.\n One of the more interesting aspects of a developed tongues speaker is that sometimes the sounds they make seem like another language. Most achieve this via practicing to make it 'sound better'. Borrowing sounds from established languages that they might have been exposed to to make the gibberish they spew seem like a real language.\n It lends an air of authenticity to their behavior.\n \n Most tounges speakers start out with child like noise \"da da daaada da da daaada di saa da\" for example.\n But, a new Christian wants to 'mature' like all those wisened ones about them, like the pastor who can rattle off \"Como si en lasmata qualiffen noto grama si en mata Jesus!\"\n Thus, they take sounds they can make but yest sound 'foreign' to their local to recite.\n I've read a few books detailing this phenomina but ex-beliefers (Pat Robertson, Oral Roberts) chronicling how they use tricks to get someone to do tongues and how they evolved their mutterings to mimick something more...'cool'.\n [/tangent]",
