We spend too much time with labels and not talking about issues. This is not an accident. The politicos spew a huge amount of rhetoric framing problems that aren't the real problem.

The left attempts to play catch up and reactively shifts to match the rhetoric. \n \n What I mean is how the right has framed all problems as an us versus the liberal, elitist, East Coast, Hollywood, intellectual, athiestic, socialistic amoral them. The \"us\" are the good guys, the real Americans, the Heartland, those God-fearing, homesteading, fiercely independent, nuclear family, man-on-top-the-way-it-should-be true patriots. And anyone who disagrees is not merely someone of a differing opinion, but an evil person. AND I should be VERY ANGRY about those people. And the country bought it. The left continually tries to react to this, either by apologizing for being liberal or maintaining they no different. \n \n The political machine, followed/supported by the media makes this all a big dichotomous name-calling mess and no one pays any attention to the issues. The right electorate is busy patting themselves on the back for being Christian patriots while their elected ones are robbing them. The left has followed suit and try to be more conservative with every passing year. \n \n There are no conservatives, the neocons and the religious right ruined that. \n There are no liberals, haven't been any since 1972. They are all too afraid to speak up. \n \n Because they are all bought and sold. It is so expensive to get elected, a politician can't do so without corporate obligations. \n \n I am wandering here.\n \n I think we need real election reform.\n \n But mostly we need people who want to think about issues instead of posture and hide behind labels.

   "Many states do give out delegates on a proportional system. The thing is, how delegates are assigned and how parties choose candidates is totally outside the framework of the government. Parties can use absolutely any system they like to pick who runs. Delegates, popular vote, flip a coin, stick a finger in the phone book. It's totally their call.\n\n \n While I still do not agree with the method that the candidates are chosen, my main concern is the presidential election. I used the Florida primary as an example. \n \n I think my problem is that I was using the word \"delegates\" when I actually was speaking about the electoral votes. My bad. I understand that there is a difference between delegates and electoral votes, but the concept of winner take all is the same (just as it was in Florida's primary). I don't really agree with the delegate system, but that is a story for another day. \n \n The winner take all concept in the presidential election is specifically why I refuse to vote. If electoral votes were awarded proportional to the popular vote, I might be somewhat satisfied. However, I still feel that a national popular vote should be enacted. If 100,000,001 votes are cast for Bob, and 100,000,000 are cast for Jane, Bob should become president. Until this happens...",

   "An amendment needs to be ratified by 3/4 of the legislatures, not 3/4 of the people.\n I assume they vote the way of the people. True this isn't always the case. And if you want to get technical it could be 3/4ths of state conventions as well.\n \n \nAnd I've seen how that 2.2% number is generated. It's very much an extreme case based on numbers breaking just right; it doesn't really show anything practical.\nThe point is that it is very hard to pass an amendment\n \n \nThat little 5 word phrase there is my biggest problem, and why I have refused to vote all my life, and probably will continue to do so in the future. Delegates should be handed out proportional to the popular vote. The delegate system is misrepresentative of a large portion of the population.\n \n For example, in the Florida primary, John McCain won 693,508 votes, or 36 percent of the vote, and was awarded all 57 delegates.\nDepends on how you look at it. If you look at it like each state selects a president then it makes sense to do it as such. The reasoning behind it was solid back when enacted...it is a little less useful now that we have strayed from the constitution so much.",

   "I agree that the system isn't great, but I don't see how not participating is supposed to help.\n\n \n Why should I participate in something I believe to be flawed, unfair, where my vote is likely not to count, and that specifically favors a 2 party system? No thanks. I excercise my right to not vote in a form of protest. Of course nobody cares but me, but it is a matter of principle.\n \n This is but one of the various reasons I do not vote. The other most obvious and important reason to me is that I have seen nobody worthy of my vote for the last 24 years. I refuse to take part in an election that involves choosing the lesser of 2 evils.",
