   "I know that I am not modest. How can an author resist recommending his own free ON-LINE book. The link to it should appear below my signature. You will see that it is an autobiography. My long life (I am 79) was not typical and I want to share what I know and think about communism, before it is too late.\n \n Unfortunately, the book is not as widely known as I expected. That is why I am looking for a reader willing to review the book somewhere, either here or in press, for example, in your local newspaper. One leftist said that my book is a cold war relic. But this is not true; no one asked me to write it. I simply felt that I must write.\n \n Thank you in advance,\n \n Ludwik Kowalski",
