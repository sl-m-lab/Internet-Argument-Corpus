   "Western countries in Uzbekistan are to blame for massacre in Andijan dating back to May 2005. At least they say so in Uzbekistan and I tend to believe into it. The sole western country now present in Uzbekistan and 'helping' through her non-profit organizations is Germany. \n I wonder who are we actually helping there and what's the cost of it to Germany? \n I am well in the know that after American and British NGOs had been wiped out of country due to their alleged involvement in Andijan events Germany has been made responsible for their line to be pursued in Uzbekistan. There's also our military base in Termez in the southern Uzbekistan and we are to keep it safe ... for Americans just in case of a new war on Iran or whoever. So firstly we are helping Americans, who are looking more of war-maniacs rather than civilized democrats I should say.\n Further, we are supportive there of a dictatorship regime terrorizing people of Uzbekistan, taking reprisals against those thinking differently. I know that many German journalists were withdrawn from Uzbekistan. Still Wolf Bauer, member of parliamentary group in charge of relationship with Central Asia states, asserts everything it is more or less OK in Uzbekistan. And then he adds, 'We need badly this base in Termez'. Is he on a payroll in America I wonder? I guess he is. So are the officials from Friedrich-Ebert Foundation engaged in 'soft dialogue' with Uzbekistan tyrant regime.\n I am sure our policy in Uzbekistan is erroneous. If we want to stay in CA for long and develop relations mutually beneficial to peoples of CA and Germany we should distance ourselves from present dictatorship regime in Uzbekistan. \n Germany should be perceived as beacon of democracy in this vital region rich in particular and worldwide in general! And we should stop dancing to the American tune as well imo.",
