   "It's too bad almost everything on this list is either not true or very misleading.\n \n I might come back around and take more on, but I'll attack a few of these now...\n \n \nShattered record for biggest annual deficit in history.\n \n In dollars. As a percent of GDP, it's half of what it was. Since our GDP is a lot larger now, why would we take the number in dollars over percent of GDP?\n \n \nSet all-time record for biggest drop in the history of the stock market.\n \n I assume that they picked a single stock index--NASDAQ--to include this. Gee, the NASDAQ, the index packed with technology and dot coms. What a wonderful example. Why did it lose 3/5 of its value? When you build an index on hope for earnings, that's an easy question.\n \n \nAfter taking the entire month of August off for vacation, presided over the worst security failure in US history.\n \n Right, because we all know when the president goes on vacation he doesn't do anything... he boards up the house and orders government officials shot on site.\n \n \nIn my first two years in office over 2 million Americans lost their jobs.\n \n And now 1.7 million jobs have been created. And a million of the jobs lost were lost after 9/11. I think there may have been a connection.\n \n \nCut unemployment benefits for more out of work Americans than any president in US history.\n \n I think this means failed to extend them. The point of unemployment is to provide money for a limited period of time, not forever. Plus workers are twice as likely to find a job when their benefits are about to expire.\n \n In any case, I think this is Congress' doing. Good for Congress.\n \n \nSet the all-time record for most foreclosures in a 12 month period.\n \n And now home ownership is at record levels.\n \n \nPresided over the highest gasoline prices in US history and refused to use the national reserves as past presidents have.\n \n Three or four cents less... thank you George! That was completely worth depleting our reserve!\n \n \nSet the all-time record for most people worldwide to simultaneously take to the streets to protest me (15 million people), shattering the record for protest against any person in the history of mankind. \n \n It's pretty sad when people can't find anyone worse to protest than Bush. There are a lot of people 100 fold worse than Bush, even if everything on this list was true.\n \n \nPresided over the biggest corporate stock market fraud of any market in any country in the history of the world.\n \n It's interesting... all of this stuff HAPPENS under Clinton. Then the Bush DOJ uncovers it and Bush gets blamed.\n \n \nFirst president in US history to have the United Nations remove the US from the human rights commission.\n \n Because we all know that W called Kofi up and begged him to do that.\n \n \nRendered the entire United Nations irrelevant.\n \n No, he didn't have to do that. He just had to show us.\n \n \nWithdrew from the World Court of Law.\n \n Good.\n \n \nFirst president in US history to refuse United Nations election inspectors (during the 2002 US elections).\n \n Good. UN needs to find something better to do.\n \n \nMy biggest life-time campaign contributor presided over one of the largest corporate bankruptcy frauds in world history (Kenneth Lay, former CEO of Enron Corporation).\n \n That's like saying to me \"Your sister murdered someone!\" like it means something. (She didn't, by the way)\n \n \nFirst president in US history to unilaterally attack a sovereign nation against the will of the United Nations and the world community.\n \n Right, because we know all those nations with us and supporting us just don't exist. We made them up in an effort to draw support to our cause.\n \n By the way, just not true. Clinton, Balkans, Russia: \"Veto!\" Clinton: \"NATO!\" Unless bombing and gunfire no longer count as an attack...\n \n \nFirst president to run and hide when the US came under attack (and then lied saying the enemy had the code to Air Force 1)\n \n First, quote Bush on saying that.\n \n Second, when the Vice President calls you and says, \"Stay away\" and the Secret Service is shaking its head, I wouldn't be caught running around Washington. The President walking across the lawn doesn't make everything better.\n \n \nFirst US president in history to have the people of South Korea more threatened by the US than their immediate neighbor, North Korea.\n\n Because we all know how afraid the South Koreans are of the US...\n \n \nFailed to fulfill my pledge to get Osama Bin Laden 'dead or alive'.\n \n It can still happen. We'll get hime one day.\n \n \nFailed to capture the anthrax killer who tried to murder the leaders of our country at the United States Capitol building. After 18 months I have no leads and zero suspects.\n \n Because the President is running around in an FBI van looking, inspecting the evidence at the FBI lab.\n \n I can't we to see the pictures of the President arresting the anthrax killer.\n \n \nRemoved more freedoms and civil liberties for Americans than any other president in US history.\n \n USA PATRIOT Act- Senate, 97-1. House, 350+-60-something.\n \n \nIn a little over two years created the most divided country in decades, possibly the most divided the US has ever been since the civil war.\n \n Right, because the country wasn't divided at all during the 2000 election.\n \n \nEntered office with the strongest economy in US history and in less than two years turned every single economic category heading straight down.\n\n Recession began in October 2000. Fact. Check the economic indicators.\n \n Plus, I think 9/11 helped a little.\n \n \nAll records of any SEC investigations into my insider trading or bankrupt companies are sealed in secrecy and un-available for public view.\n \n But we all know that he was investigated and dismissed, so big deal. In one case one of the stocks he sold was worth twice as much a year later.\n \n \nFor personal references please speak to my daddy or uncle James Baker (They can be reached at their offices of the Carlyle Group for war-profiteering.)\n \n The Carlyle Group's connection is through BDM, a defense contractor. BDM was sold before the wars.\n \n I bet they're really counting their war profits over there at Carlyle.\n \n \n \n Wow, I went on more than I thought I would. Well, that's Ok.\n \n Four more years! Not that I'm a big Bush fan, but he beats Kerry. I'm out to defend the truth... if you can identify anything I've said that isn't true or is misleading, please point it out so I can correct my understanding of things.",

Why would Bush change it?\n \n In any case, note the wording. al-Qaeda only. That means any statement mentioned any other terrorist group or terrorism in general would be excluded from the count.\n \n \n* 0 Number of times Bush mentioned Osama bin Laden in his three State of the Union addresses.\n \n What president would have mentioned bin Laden in his State of the Union when they couldn't find him...?\n \n Of course you address the new fronts.\n \n \n* $1m Estimated value of a painting the Bush Presidential Library in College Station, Texas, received from Prince Bandar, Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States and Bush family friend.\n \n So what?\n \n \n* 0 Number of times Bush mentioned Saudi Arabia in his three State of the Union addresses.\n \n Why would he?\n \n \n* 1,700 Percentage increase between 2001 and 2002 of Saudi Arabian spending on public relations in the United States.\n \n Gee, they didn't have any reason to do that.\n \n \n* 79 Percentage of the 11 September hijackers who came from Saudi Arabia\n \n Which may have been intentional on the part of al Qaeda in the first place.

That says a lot.\n \n \n# 2000 Year that Cheney said his policy as CEO of Halliburton oil services company was \"we wouldn't do anything in Iraq\".\n \n Yeah, because after 2000 Cheney was secretly controlling the company. What do you think he's been doing in that undisclosed location?\n \n \n# $4.7bn Total value of contracts awarded to Halliburton in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n \n Kellog, Brown, & Root won the bid for the general services/supply contract for the US military after losing it for about 6 years. It is standard practice to issue temporary, no-bid contracts to the holder of the general contract to support the deployments.\n \n Same thing was done by Clinton in the Balkans. With the same company.\n \n \n# $2.8bnValue of Bechtel Corp contracts in Iraq.\n \n Don't know enough about this specifically, but contracts aren't controlled by the White House. That's the job of thousands of civil servants who work administration to administration.

Addressing Congress in February 2001, CIA director George Tenet said \"bin Laden and his global network of lieutenants and associates remain the most immediate and serious threat.\" \n\n \nIn any case, note the wording. al-Qaeda only. That means any statement mentioned any other terrorist group or terrorism in general would be excluded from the count.\n But that was our greatest an most imminent threat.\n \n \nWhat president would have mentioned bin Laden in his State of the Union when they couldn't find him...?\n In NONE of them? You wouldn't mention the name of the man that the entire nation wants dead or captured?\n \n \nSo what?\n\n You don't think its odd that the Saudi royal family financially supports the Bush family all the time?\n \n \nWhy would he?\n\n They are only the source of 15/19 Sept. 11 hijackers. They are connected to bin Laden. They were kicking our troops out. They finance terrorists. \n http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=31265\n http://www.meforum.org/article/537\n http://www.lp.org/press/archive.php?function=view&record=578\n \n \nWhich may have been intentional on the part of al Qaeda in the first place. The best way to destroy the Saudi government is for us to stop buying their oil.\nWhen will we ever stop buying their oil?\n \n \nWhich the 9/11 Commission found no problem with. Everyone was properly questioned. The bin Laden family had already been being monitored by the FBI prior to 9/11.\nNo they weren't. No one was questioned. http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=34405\n \n \nI wouldn't want to stick around with that name.\n\n Thank god that when you have that name you get a special plane ride!\n \n \n \nThere is no history of US presidents attening memorial services for soldiers during times of war.\n\n http://www.historynewsnetwork.com/articles/1784.html",

   "Are you saying that Iraq and terrorism are two separate issues? Bush might have wanted to listen to George Tenet the FIRST time. http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004...ain609885.shtml\n \n You seem like the kind of person who would say that. Prior to 9/11 Iraq and al Qaeda would probably be considered seperate my most people. Until after 9/11 when all the links were revealed.\n \n \nBut that was our greatest an most imminent threat.\n \n Prior to 9/11?\n \n Terrorism, broadly, includes al Qaeda.\n \n \nIn NONE of them? You wouldn't mention the name of the man that the entire nation wants dead or captured?\n \n If I hadn't found him, no. That would just give the Democrats something to pounce on.\n \n \nYou don't think its odd that the Saudi royal family financially supports the Bush family all the time?\n \n The Saudis have an oil fortune. The Bush family is also wealthy. Both do that sort of thing... especially with investments.\n \n \nThey are only the source of 15/19 Sept. 11 hijackers. They are connected to bin Laden. They were kicking our troops out. They finance terrorists. \n \n But al Qaeda as a whole isn't composed of mostly Saudis. And they didn't kick our troops out...we pulled out. If I was the Saudi King I wouldn't want US forces using my bases to do something that upsets the Muslim world. They're close enough to being toppled.\n \n Basically, the Royal family is better than the regime that would replace them. I don't like the Saudis. Make no mistake.\n \n \nWhen will we ever stop buying their oil?\n \n When they run out.\n \n \nNo they weren't. No one was questioned.\n \n That's not what the 9/11 Commission found. They weren't grilled--they didn't have to be. They'd already been under FBI watch and had their phones tapped.\n \n \nhttp://www.historynewsnetwork.com/articles/1784.html\n \n See, the first two they never say whether they attended funerals.\n \n Johnson attended funerals for soldiers who died that were related to certain people. Not random soldiers.\n \n Nixon didn't attend any.\n \n Reagan and Carter never fought a war.\n \n George HW didn't.\n \n Clinton attended a special service not related to a war.\n \n So, no history of presidents attending funerals for soldiers during times of war.",

We are sustaining 95% of casualties, and we're footing 95% of the bill, all by tax money, not Iraqi oil.\n \n \n It's closer to 85% of the troops. The other 15% is important too. \n \n If you world economy was better, we'd have more foreign troops in Iraq.\n \n \nThe attacks on Serbia were totally at the behest of the UN and NATO. Not all of NATO or UN was \"with us\" on GWII\n \n That's just not true. The UNSC did not approve that attack.\n \n According to Kofi Annan, that would be a violation of the charter.\n \n \n NATO doesn't have to be.
