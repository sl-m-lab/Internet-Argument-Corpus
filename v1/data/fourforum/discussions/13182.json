   "As derived from my exploratory campaign web site...\n \n \n \n d) But the real issue, is the fact that most often, the girl is left to fend for herself, and ends up alone when she commits a mortal sin by killing her un-born child, BUT WHAT DOES THE FATHER HAVE TO DO? MORE OFTEN THAN NOT... nothing... the fathers are just walking away...even though often, they made promises and assurances to the girl before the sex act, and yet, when conception occurs those men are no where to be found.\n \n Therefore I would propose fathering laws, to hold men responsible for abortions, by mandating that women who have abortions, can give the name of the man or boy, and that simple DNA testing can prove they are the father, and those hesitant fathers, should do three months of hard labor, for each abortion they cause, by their lack of commitment and affection. In this way, the girls, and women are not imprisoned, or punished, but men who choose not to use a condom, and made false promises, will pay for their part of the sin.\n \n Of course, the girl, must be willing to give the name, and if she is given anonymity, and protections, she can do so, or not, if she chooses to, or not to. After which, before the abortion, the Father could be contacted by some means and given notice, such that later, after the abortion he cannot claim that he did not know, and as such, is guilty, if he allows the abortion to occur. THIS, will give the man, the chance to marry the girl, or be punished for his lack of affection and concern. But again, all of this is dependant on the girl, willingly giving the mans name, and he must actually be the father to be convicted.\n \n And as such, this law would directly prevent most abortions, by making the fathers responsible for them, as they SHOULD BE! \n \n \n So, unless they actually want to have kids THIS LAW, will put a condom on all males. \n \n So, if the goal is to prevent abortions, the best and only real solution is to get the males to wear a condom, and or otherwise be willing support the child, or to MARRY THE GIRL!!!!\n \n This kind of law, would do just that... and does not punish the female.\n \n \n -Mosheh Thezion",

   "Because naturally the man should be responsible to pay for it... one way or another, to support it... and her in marraige, or provide child support, as provided in the law... he did the deed, and must be made to pay..\n The idea is that if men are held responsible for abortions, then they will put on a condom instead of taking the chance,... and hence.. reduce the abortions or the need there of, and this would incourage them to marry.\nWhy is there this onus on the man to do everything? As I said before, it is just as much the woman's choice to have unprotected sex as it is the mans - if this is not the case, then it is already covered by rape laws. By your proposition, only the man need worry about birth control - the woman has no legal necessity to do so at all.\n \n It's not a case that 'the man did the deed' - both parties are potentially just as culpable. If you're going to introduce legal consequences for abortion, they are going to have to affect all the guilty parties; the woman included. \n \n However, personally I would argue against adding further legal restrictions to abortion.\n \n \num... gee... its killing a baby... now.. before 8 weeks, its not in the form of a human being.. at 4 weeks, its a fish.. at 5.. its a rodent.. but after 8.. its in the shape of a human... there is no way around that fact.\nSo you only class an abortion as something that occurs 8 weeks after conception?\n That's your line to draw. However, I doubt you could persuade many courts that 'looking like a human' was a valid qualifier for being a person.\n \n Everyone draws the line somewhere - be it conception, birth, or some point in between the two (if not before or after, in some cases). That doesn't mean that their version of 'the line' should automatically be the legal one. At the moment (in the UK, at least), that line is legally drawn at the point when the baby becomes viable; that is, when it could potentially survive a premature birth. Before that point, everyone can choose their own qualifiers.\n \n You can argue that the line should be legally redrawn... but I doubt 'looking like a human' will be considered the strongest of arguments.\n \n \nThe only time, the girl will give the name... is when the guy made promises, and refuses to marry... refuses to care.. and the girl is left alone.\nTo clarify: is it the womans choice whether the guy is prosecuted after he has been named, or is it the states? By what you've said so far, it seems that all this law does is give woman the power to punish men if they get pregnant by them; despite the fact that the woman was just as consenting as the man at the time of the coitus.\n \n There are also contraceptive paths for women that don't involve condoms. If a woman gets pregnant because she forgot to take the pill that morning and always relied on that rather than on condoms to stop her getting pregnant, why should the man be punished?\n \n The message here should be simple. If you don't want an abortion, and aren't currently in a position where you can support your children, don't have unprotected sex. At the moment, it is the woman's choice alone whether she has an abortion or not, so it is the woman who has to look after the child if she is single after its birth. If you want to add men to that equation, you have to add them in both places - give them the legal right to 'have an abortion' (force their partner to have one), and make them legally responsible for the child if they do not do so. Then you have an entirely connected couple from coitus onwards; both consenting to sex, both choosing not to have an abortion and both caring for the child after birth. I doubt that that law would be a popular one, either - but if you are going to force a man to take equal legal responsibility for a child, you have to give them equal legal opportunity to avoid it.",

My father left when I was 18 and they should have split when I was ten. Nobody should be forced to endure a miserable marriage. Its not fun for anyone, especially the kids. And there are plenty of men (and women) who should not let within ten feet of a child.\n \n Here is what I actually think:\n \n Abortion has been proven to be reduced through education, adequate health care, access to birth control, instilling self respect in girls (losing the idea that the MUST have a man), and addressing the needs of pregnant women. I also strongly support the rights of women to make their own medical decisions without interfearance from you, the government or peckerwood preachers.\n \n Nobody should be forced to parent. I support a more comprehensive adoption system and the ability for either parent to sign away their parental rights by the time the child is born. No child is serviced by being raised by someone who does not want them or will resent them.\n \n The institution of marriage should not be forced on anyone nor should it matter more than the people in it. If everyone is miserable and that isn't going to change - end it.\n \n All parents should be held accountable for their children via time and money spent - but just because someone (a man) may be partly responsible for my son does not mean I should be compelled to marry his XXX or do his laundry.\n\n \n I never said anyone should be forced to be a parent...\n \n They can just pay child support... or abort the kid.\n \n But when a woman... wants the baby... and the guy does not.. and abandons the woman... who then has no choice...\n \n THEN THAT GUY SHOULD GO TO JAIL.\n \n PERIOD.\n \n I never said women should be forced to birth the child.\n \n a dah..\n \n It is the potential threat... of going to jail, which will increase condom use... so that the guy.. doesnt have to worry about this girl trying to force marriage due to their one night stand.\n \n -Mosheh Thezion",

Mosheh Thezion's Campaign Committee for U.S. Senate (R) | EDUCATION\n \n 3) being into music.. is not a flaw.. and is a gift.. to which I have no talent... \n \n 4) and laziness... is learned.. and habitual.. and if we throw drugs in the mix.. it only gets worse.. I know.. many called me lazy for most of my life, but the fact is.. I had trouble sleeping.. and with reuhmatism pain.. and fatigue.. its a big challenge... but there are things which help..\n and we must experiment with them.. TO FIND THEM..\n \n FOR EXAMPLE... ginko biloba... and ginsing.. have changed my life.. where i used to sleep 10 hours a day.. i now only sleep 5... because i take a ginko biloba and ginsing pill.. before i go to sleep.. and now i sleep like a baby, and wake up in five hours.. and have no trouble getting up..\n but for most of my life... I could not get out of bed.\n \n 5) did the filters help?\n and dont think farm land.. doesnt have its own smog.. as far as animal waste and pollen.. and stuff goes.. something.. something.. is stimulating the immune responce... aND IF YOU CAN get rid of it.. or turn off the responce.. you may find releif.\n \n 6) humidity... can also cause ashma... as i learned by moving to the southern east coast.. when i joined the army.. i thought i was going to die.\n \n 7) I never cured my arthritus... it is simply that arthirtus.. like ashma.. is an allergic reaction... in the case of arthritus... it is food.\n I am practically cured now.. because I take 30 grams of omega 3 concentrate each day... which nuetralizes the food im eating, and so.. turns off the immune responce.\n \n i.e.. yummy foods... like meat.. sour cream.. ice cream.. milk.. cheese.. they are all like omega 6... and they turn on the immune responce, cause it... but omega 3... turns it off.. which is why fish oil... is nuetral because it has equal amounts of 3 and 6....\n so... by taking an omega 3 concentrate.. which has extra 3... it serves the purpose of nuetralising the food which is like omega 6...\n \n I was almost bed ridden.. and looking a wheel chairs...\n \n but, today.. with omega 3... I am normal.. and able to work out.. and have full function again.. and most of the damage has been reparied... BECAUSE I FOUND A WAY TO SHUT OFF THE IMMUNE RESPONCE.\n \n there is a cause.. and effect... for why your immune system is flaring up... and the best way to combat it.. is to experiment with large doses of natural sources of anti-imflamatory foods... like omega 3 oils.. or blue berries.. etc..\n they shut down the immune responce..\n \n I can eat 2 pounds of blue berries a day.. and get the same relief.. but they are so expensive... and the fish ol works great.\n \n The first thing you might do... is try an omega 3 fish oil concentrate... in large doses.. like 10-20 grams... and see if it helps...\n \n or eat a massive pack of blue berries.. and see if it helps.\n \n god gave us every herb of the earth for our benefit.. and one of them may be your salvation.\n \n I..\n \n used to literally have the body of an 80 year old man...\n \n but today... i can work out.. and am running for Congress.\n \n Do not give up.. and give in... we must fight on.\n \n And I would gladly have kids... as the fact is... no matter how much i am suffering... it is better than nothing at all.\n \n even if I am in massive pain... atleast im alive, and by fighting on, I can have that level of self respect in doing so....\n \n we must never give up, and give in, and quit.\n \n Please dont.\n \n -Mosheh Thezion emoticon_xbouncer",

Silphium figured so prominently in the wealth of Cyrene that the plant appeared on the obverse and reverse of coins minted there. Silphium, which was native only to that part of Libya, was overharvested by the Greeks and was effectively driven to extinction. The standard theory, however, has been challenged by a whole spectrum of alternatives (from an extinction due to climate factors, to the so-coveted product being in fact a recipe made of a composite of herbs, attribution to a single species meant perhaps as a disinformation attempt).\n \n As Christianity and in particular the institution of the Catholic Church increasingly influenced European society, those who dispensed abortifacient herbs found themselves classified as witches and were often persecuted.\n \n Medieval Muslim physicians documented detailed and extensive lists of birth control practices, including the use of abortifacients, commenting on their effectiveness and prevalence. The use of abortifacients was acceptable to Islamic jurists provided that the abortion occurs within 120 days, the point when the fetus is considered to become fully human and receive its soul.\n\n Abortifacient - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia",

   "You need to get together with the Lord God of Creation - the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob - the LORD JESUS CHRIST.  Get rid of your failed reincarnation follies - they're probably one of the main reasons you're sick, because you have not made the Lord of Glory your Great God and Savior!\n \n \n You have your answer. And when you make Jesus your Lord God and Savior for the remission of your sins, he will make you whole, and then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.\n \n Isaiah 53 - 750 B.C. - A Prophecy of the Christ\n \n 1 Who has believed our message \n and to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed? \n \n 2 He grew up before him like a tender shoot, \n and like a root out of dry ground. \n He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, \n nothing in his appearance that we should desire him. \n \n 3 He was despised and rejected by men, \n a man of sorrows, and familiar with suffering. \n Like one from whom men hide their faces \n he was despised, and we esteemed him not. \n \n 4 Surely he took up our infirmities \n and carried our sorrows, \n yet we considered him stricken by God, \n smitten by him, and afflicted. \n \n 5 But he was pierced for our transgressions, \n he was crushed for our iniquities; \n the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, \n and by his wounds we are healed. \n \n  6 We all, like sheep, have gone astray, \n each of us has turned to his own way; \n and the LORD has laid on him \n the iniquity of us all. \n \n 7 He was oppressed and afflicted, \n yet he did not open his mouth; \n he was led like a lamb to the slaughter, \n and as a sheep before her shearers is silent, \n so he did not open his mouth. \n \n 8 By oppression and judgment he was taken away. \n And who can speak of his descendants? \n For he was cut off from the land of the living; \n for the transgression of my people he was stricken. \n \n 9 He was assigned a grave with the wicked, \n and with the rich in his death, \n though he had done no violence, \n nor was any deceit in his mouth. \n \n 10 Yet it was the LORD's will to crush him and cause him to suffer, \n and though the LORD makes his life a guilt offering, \n he will see his offspring and prolong his days, \n and the will of the LORD will prosper in his hand. \n \n 11 After the suffering of his soul, \n he will see the light of life and be satisfied; \n by his knowledge my righteous servant will justify many, \n and he will bear their iniquities. \n \n 12 Therefore I will give him a portion among the great, \n and he will divide the spoils with the strong, \n because he poured out his life unto death, \n and was numbered with the transgressors. \n For he bore the sin of many, \n and made intercession for the transgressors.\n \n \n Psalm 139:13-14 (New International Version)\n \n 13 For you created my inmost being; \n you knit me together in my mother's womb. \n \n 14 I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; \n your works are wonderful, \n I know that full well.\n\n \n ... So basically your God makes girls sick from the age of two? At that point, I was going to church, and in foster care and very sick with asthma and my ear infections. My later adoptive parents had no idea what was sick until they ran a battery of breathing tests since I would turn blue and need to be rushed to the hospital. That was also when I was basically deaf from fluid in my ears. I would have constant ear infections and they were so painful I would scream and bang my head against the wall. \n \n So your kind and just God makes it okay for you to insult my beliefs? I don't have the beliefs you do, and I don't insult you. I believe that makes me more mature and open minded and oh my, I don't have a religion.",

   "Originally Posted by Easyrider: What did you do, turn your back on God? Not a good plan.\n \n \n \n Satan has an independent voice and mind, Jazy, so you'll have to come up with something better than that. But she did answer the question, writing, \"I decided to leave the church after my car was keyed with slurs and threats after mentioning I was bi.\"\n \n So, somebody sinned in keying her car and using slurs. \n \n So that makes it ok for her to sin and leave Christ? \n \n That's absolutely the most lame excuse I've heard yet.\n \n \n No but it gives justification of the hate and slander your people fling at others in their intolerance and sheer repugnant attitudes. She lost her faith in ORGANIZED religion Easy. It doesn't mean she has rejected anything. But then again if no one follows your own beat while threatening absolute damnation for being diverse I guess it would be safe to assume that then they are in your eyes heathens and scum right?\n \n [QUOTE=Easyrider;370694On the other hand, it might just appear she's choosing bi-sexuality over Christ, which isn't a good plan either. And you're sticking up for that folly. Like I've said elsewhere, you continually choose the gay thing over the Christ thing. That's your idol. That's what you do. You'll back-slap anyone who chooses illicit sin over Christ.  Shame on you!\n \n \n \n \n \n Look who just let out the sewer full of hatred - YOU! \n \n I Corinthians 6:9-10[/QUOTE]\n \n \n Illicit sin? Let me make this clear to you Easy. There are many gay Christians including myself. I see that being gay is not sin but another part of the design of a creator that we in our minds cannot fathom. I see the payment of death from Christ and his unbiased teachings of love and aid a cornerstone in the hearts of many people who can relate to such things. \n \n However I am also an activist. Seeing what the people like you do with religion. Seeing the Pat Robertson's and the James Dobsons's of religion come forth and leave a black mark upon the true meaning of salvation to legislation and power is sick and twisted in malice and contempt for their fellow man, and a degradation to the system of government that has clears set a boundary of separation between church and state.\n \n \n [QUOTE=Easyrider;370694Finally, regarding your lame remarks on Isaiah 53 (\"Oh, but the magical oil of the baby jesus will make it all better right?\"), that tells me the rest of the story. Now you're bad-mouthing the Great God and Savior of the Universe, Jesus Christ. All in the name of radical left-wing gay pride nonsense. Realnice, Jazy. You're a real class act, alright (NOT!!). Don't ever try to tell anyone you're a Christian, because you're still steeped in godless, carnal, self-idolatry.[/QUOTE]\n \n Oh I won't tell them I'm a Christian Easy. I'll just let you keep on damning others and showing them the true meaning of Christianity with your tyrannical self righteous views in a volatile mixture of hate, prejudice, and bigotry.",

   "As derived from my exploratory campaign web site...\n \n \n \n d) But the real issue, is the fact that most often, the girl is left to fend for herself, and ends up alone when she commits a mortal sin by killing her un-born child, BUT WHAT DOES THE FATHER HAVE TO DO? MORE OFTEN THAN NOT... nothing... the fathers are just walking away...even though often, they made promises and assurances to the girl before the sex act, and yet, when conception occurs those men are no where to be found.\n \n Therefore I would propose fathering laws, to hold men responsible for abortions, by mandating that women who have abortions, can give the name of the man or boy, and that simple DNA testing can prove they are the father, and those hesitant fathers, should do three months of hard labor, for each abortion they cause, by their lack of commitment and affection. In this way, the girls, and women are not imprisoned, or punished, but men who choose not to use a condom, and made false promises, will pay for their part of the sin.\n \n Of course, the girl, must be willing to give the name, and if she is given anonymity, and protections, she can do so, or not, if she chooses to, or not to. After which, before the abortion, the Father could be contacted by some means and given notice, such that later, after the abortion he cannot claim that he did not know, and as such, is guilty, if he allows the abortion to occur. THIS, will give the man, the chance to marry the girl, or be punished for his lack of affection and concern. But again, all of this is dependant on the girl, willingly giving the mans name, and he must actually be the father to be convicted.\n \n And as such, this law would directly prevent most abortions, by making the fathers responsible for them, as they SHOULD BE! \n \n \n So, unless they actually want to have kids THIS LAW, will put a condom on all males. \n \n So, if the goal is to prevent abortions, the best and only real solution is to get the males to wear a condom, and or otherwise be willing support the child, or to MARRY THE GIRL!!!!\n \n This kind of law, would do just that... and does not punish the female.\n \n \n -Mosheh Thezion\n\n \n But you must realize that it is not always the males fault. For sometimes the girl just decides that the male should not wear a condom, and in some instances she insists that he goes without one. So, when she finally cries wolf, why should he be held responsible? Because she chose not to?\n \n Sure, he should have his wits about him, and think about it, but it's not all of his fault.\n \n I do believe in having to support the girl, but I don't believe in that having that all based upon a promise. Words are words, she should have made sure that he followed them up with something before uncrossing her legs. It's not always his fault, that she couldn't hold them. He just got caught in the cross fire.\n \n While I am pro-life, I don't believe that he should HAVE TO MARRY THE GIRL! I don't think that one mistake should cause them both to be tied down. And then, what if the guy turns out to be a slime-ball? An abuser, rapist, murderer or something? Then you're subjecting both the girl, and the baby to a life of constant danger. I don't think that's fair to anyone. \n \n All in all, I think that the concept of child support should be kept in tact. That seems to work sometimes.\n \n Either that, or we, the people, should work out some sort of chastity pact. Something that enables the girls to have children, but does not allow it possible while they are young. That or having them keep the big V.\n \n Something other than the ideas that you proposed, although I do like your child support concept. That should be kept around. However, I do think that the other laws are reckless without thought.",
