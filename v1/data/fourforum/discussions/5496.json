   "It makes no secret, militants from various illegal armed units like al-Qaeda or Taliban or Chechen battalion of shahids called Riyadus-Salikhin, take shelter in the West where they feel absolutely safe. They stay there as refugees and a state gives them refugee pay and the police doesn't bother with them. They come to a zone of conflict only for a short moment to deliver a localized impact and retreat whereas US soldiers stay there every day facing mortal danger.....\n \n Mohammed Abu Bakar, citizen of Canada, was shot in the head in Chechnya. He was was a member of a special miner group and was training Chechen militants and teaching them to do blast service later in Iraq, Afghanistan and Chechnya. According to his relatives, Abu Bakar had left for Azerbajan to attend a wedding feast (that's how shahids call a suicide bomber attack). Azerbajan along with Georgia is a gateway for Islamic militants who are going to make Jihad. Statistically, demolition war in Iraq takes lives of about 30 American soldiers monthly. If the things go on like that, US Army will for ever stay in Iraq day after day sending packages with corpses back home....",
