There was a recent case where the court-appointed lawyer bragged that he never carried more papers with him than could fit in his pocket. The law proffessor at the University of Maryland (this happened in Baltimore) said he would have flunked a first year law student for handing in the brief he handed in to the judge. In this case the guy was sentenced to life w/o parole when the only evidence the prosecution had was that he was seen with the person who committed the assault on that same day in the morning. That was all. Not only that, but the person who was accused of the assault (the only evidence they had against this person with a court-appointed lawyer) was found not guilty. Yet this guy, supposedly an accomplice to the guy found not guilty, was sentenced to life w/o parole. Yet OJ Simpson has almost all the evidence pointing towards him and he gets off.

   "It's not the actual killing that cost so much. It is the appeals process, the average 15 years every condemned prisoner spends on death row, receiving free state appointed lawyers and defense teams, court costs, cost of guards to watch and transport prisoners, etc etc etc. If you want to cut costs, reform the appeals process.\n\n \n THe appeals process is retarted anyway. If someone is obviously a murderer then execute them. If it is unsure whether they are guilty or not then they probably won't be in jail for murder. If they are in jail but it still isn't sure then leave them in jail.\n \n \nYour \"creative\" methods of execution are amusing, but not likely to be adopted by any civilized society. \n\n \n It all depends on what you consider uncivilized. I consider letting murderers stay alive uncivilized. Many people think the death sentence is wrong but support our troops at the same time because the protect our freedom. They are fighting for our safety by shooting terrorists. What is the difference? The fact that terrorists aren't legal citizens? Terrorists kill. Murderers kill. They are the same. Killing terrorists keeps us more safe. Killing murderers will keep us more safe.\n Some people think that a bloody death is uncivilized. Then we would be considered an uncivilized country because shooting someone to death is very bloody, and our soldiers do that daily to those who threaten us. \n how about hangings? Would those be considered uncivilized? That would mean most of the old kingdoms from the past were uncivilized because hangings were a very popular way of executing criminals.\n \n \nAnd I take exception to your last comment. One might say that it would take a total lack of common sense for someone to think that the actual execution was what cost so much money, and to suggest that by lopping off heads or drowning people we could save mass amounts of money...but I would not paint with that broad brush...it would be rude and show a level of ignorance I am not comfortable with. emoticon_wow\n\n \n Well what I said above solves the whole death row problem. There would be no death row. There would be executions for murderers and jail time for others. No more money would be needed for the 15 year death row trials 'ause they wouldn't exist. I'm not sure what you meant by the broad brush and ignorance part. Please reword it. Are you calling me ignorant for thinking drowning is cheap? As far as I know it would cost anything to throw someone into a lake. \n \n And the line \n \nOne might say that it would take a total lack of common sense for someone to think that the actual execution was what cost so much money\n\n isn't correct. Common sense is common knowledge or something that can be figured out easily. I have no idea what the costs for the court cases are because I've never studied it. It isn't commonly known knowledge just like the amount of money a manager of Burger King makes isn't commonly known knowledge. All I know is that managers make more than cashiers. I easily found a solution to the cost problem. And then when you pointed out how the execution itself isn't the expensive part I easily figured out a cheap way around the court costs. I still hold true to the belief that America has lost it's common sense. When a man broke his leg while breaking into someone's house and then sued them and won I knew America had lost it.",

Or is that the claim of someone else, a contemporary or two perhaps?\n\n \n\n The Emancipation Proclamation was a presidential order on January 1, 1863 declaring the freedom of all slaves in those areas of the Confederate States of America that had not already returned to Union control. It was not a law passed by a Congress but a proclamation issued by President Abraham Lincoln, based on the war powers given to the President by the Constitution. Its immediate impact was only upon slaves that had already escaped to the Union side, but as the Union armies advanced, hundreds or thousands of slaves were liberated each day - until nearly all 4 million were free by summer 1865. (The border states freed their own slaves, except Kentucky, where some slavery existed until December 1865.)\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation\n \n\n And could slaves have been freed in territories, legally?

[/quote]\n Lincoln didn't believe that the Federal government had the power to abolish slavery.\n \n\n Before the American Civil War and even in the war's early stages Lincoln said that the Constitution prohibited the federal government from abolishing slavery where it already existed. His position, and that of his Republican Party was that in the long run the country could not exist half slave and half free. Like most Americans at the time, he believed slavery had to expand to survive. His position and the position of the Republican Party in 1860 was that slavery should not be allowed to expand into any more territories, and thus all future states admitted to the Union would be free states.\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln_on_slavery\n \n",

Vengeance is a natural human emotion. I am sure I would also feel a desire for vengeance if a loved one were brutally killed. If we, as a society, honestly look at the issue and admit that our desire for state sanctioned vengeance overrides all other considerations, then, by all means, we should continue to have the death penalty.

My belief in the death penalty stems from the brutality of the crime, not from my own desire to enact \"sanctioned vengeance.\" It is extremely important not to confuse punishment and revenge.\n\n What, in your view, is the purpose of \"punishment\"? \n \n I would think that, for most people, \"punishment\" implies the imposition of a certain type of suffering on the offender so that the offender does not repeat the action that resulted in the punishment. In that sense, it is a type of teaching tool - teaching them a lesson not to do that type of criminal action again. From that point of view, the death penalty cannot be viewed as a punishment against the offender since there will be no offender left that will have learned the lesson - he will be dead.\n \n For others, \"punishment\" might include an automatic imposition of a government action (via imprisonment, death penalty, etc.) in response to an offender's action (i.e. crime) so that those who might contemplate a crime will realize that the automatic punishment follows and will thus be dissuaded from the crime. From that point of view, one could argue that the purpose of the death penalty would be to dissuade others from committing such extreme crimes. Theoretically, one would think that it would have a large effect but most studies I have seen point to the presence of the death penalty in a state playing very little role in the homicide rates in that state. Indeed, in general, states without the death penalty seem to have lower homicide rates. Thus, homicide rates are more dependent on local economies, etc. than on any dissuading factor of a fear of punishment.",

First of all, nothing is convenient about pregnancy, I don't know where you got that, and that word carries no weight coming out of your mouth because you haven't been pregnant before. Second, if the situation were turned, you would probably say \"Purposely indulging in an act that carries risk to your own body for your own convenience and then committing suicide\" if we were talking about peds. getting hit by cars.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6. I have not lied, nor changed my stance. Resorting to calling names does not lend credence to your argument.\n\n \n What does lying or changing your stance have to do with being hypocritical?\n \n \n \n \nI not only approve of executing criminals, I demand it. I do not enjoy when it occurs, but consider it the right thing to do.\n\n \n Everyone in this country may not share your flawed perception. Many think its wrong, many think its right, and no one is more powerful than the other or more right than the other.\n \n \n \n \n \nI do cherish the process with which the life of an innocent comes to be. It is what should be the beginning of life for one not so entwined in itself that it would consider it's own convenience above the life of another who is innocent.\n\n \n Thats your twisting of words, and not mine. The beginning of a human being is the first sign on intelligence, not the first sign of DNA. What similarities do we share besides DNA?\n \n \n \n \n \n7. Not worthy of a response.\n\n \n Oh come on, Gman. I could've dodged a question better than that. If you're going to run away from my arguments, at least do it in a sneaky way.\n \n \n \n \n \n8. Yes, it would. I just don't use politically correct terms to define myself.\n\n \n Ok, but are you the defonition of the politically correct term \"pro-life\"?\n \n \n \n \n10. symantics.\n\n \n What?\n \n \n \n \n11. Yes, you say you agree 100%. It is relevant due to the fact that the woman \"makes the choice\".\n\n \n She does not make a choice once the embryo (if the embryo) becomes a child. \n \n \n \n \n \n12. Convenience is not being used to describe \"being pregnant\". It is being used to describe the act of abortion so as not to be \"inconvenienced\" by pregnancy.\n\n \n You practically just stated \"Convenience is not being used to describe 'being pregnant', its being used to describe pregnancy\". Could you please restate that?\n \n \n \n \n13. Because it is the right thing to do. Murderers and rapist forfeit their right to life when they ignore the rights of their victims.\n\n \n Since when?\n \n \n \n \n \n14./15. You are shitting me with this assinine statement aren't you?\n \n \n Whats so \"assinine\" about it?\n \n \n \n \n \n16. Fortunately for me I'm not worried about world opinion. heh?\n\n \n I would advise listening to it once in awhile. The KKK said the same thing.\n \n \n \n \n17. When babies are aborted. the remnants of it's body must be scraped from the womb.\n\n \n First, a baby cannot live inside of a womb. Second, I thought they used some sort of vaccum to get it out.\n \n \n \n \n18. You wonder why what is? Why you resort to name calling?\n\n \n Please state the name that I called you.\n \n \n \n \n \nThat's usually a symptom of lack of confidence in one's argument.\n\n \n Where is your proof of that?\n \n \n \n \n \n19. What torture do you refer to? The fate that they forced upon their victims?\n\n \n Being locked in a cage like an animal with thugs for 23 hours a day, being beaten by guards and living in inhumane living conditions.\n \n \n \n \n20. You twist my statement as you can not accept responsibility for your own ideals concerning the scraping and disposal of what would be a child if left alone without shame. I suspect.\n\n \n Your statement was twisted enough as it is now. I only twisted it back because you twisted it in the first place.\n \n \n \n \n \n21. I did not say that you would not verdict fairly. I say you would never condemn to death. That too falls upon a juror. They make recommendations to the judge for the sentence and most often judges accept the jury's recommendation. My concern for the victims and the families suggest that I care for the right people. Those tortured through no action of their own.\n\n \n \"The right of the people\"? To be more accurate, you should rephrase that to \"The right of some people\".",

   "This seems to be where we differ. You call it revenge, I call it punishment. (hence the name \"capitol punishment\"). \n \n So tell me, why do you consider it punishment to lock someone in a cage for the rest of their life (sometimes 60+ years), yet it is automatically revenge to execute them? Couldn't we turn around and state that it is simply revenge to lock someone in a cage for 50 years? I don't buy it. I see revenge as something that affected parties would persue outside the judicial theatre, and punishment as something society persues inside the judicial theatre. Difference there. This is why juries are supposed to be made up of fair and impartial members, not members of the family. \n \n Only people personally affected by the crime (ie. relative and friends of the victim, etc.) can seek revenge. I as an impartial outsider brought in as a juror in such a case seeks to determine innocence or guilt, and in most cases determines the severity of punishment, up to and including death. How could I call it revenge against the convicted when s/he has not done anything to me personally?\n\n There is a question that one can pose which cuts to the question of whether capital punishment is vengeance or, as you claim, punishment. Namely, if, while waiting on that death row, the offender truly did make a complete conversion (through faith or some other means) to become a safe, responsible individual to the point where even you would see that he was no longer dangerous, would you still want him to be executed? \n \n Also, what specifically, in your view, is the purpose of punishment?",

   "Jumping into the fray here, your reaction supports a general standing theory I have that the desire for the death penalty is nothing more than a desire for vengeance. Vengeance is a natural human emotion. I am sure I would also feel a desire for vengeance if a loved one were brutally killed. If we, as a society, honestly look at the issue and admit that our desire for state sanctioned vengeance overrides all other considerations, then, by all means, we should continue to have the death penalty. However, I, for one, am uncomfortable with the thought of our justice system being based not on reasoned analysis but on sattisfying our strongest basest emotions. Should we, as a society, indulge the emotion of vengeance? That is the question.\n\n And again, I will hold to the opinion that only those who are personally affected by said criminal can hold a desire for revenge. Society as a whole seeks justice, not revenge. \n \n I, as you can see from my post, had been personally affected by Saddam and his actions. But does it indicate a desire for vengeance that I found his death in some way satisfying? Only I can be the true judge of that. While I did find his death satisfying, for me it is not revenge...it's simply justice at work. He was tried, convicted, and sentenced in a court of law according to the local laws. Of course, it is hard to find too many fair and impartial people in cases such as Saddam due to his high level of notoriety. Perhaps the proceedings in the courtroom were based more on vengeance than a desire to seek justice, but it was carried out in the way of justice. Vengeance would have been killing him outright without the benefit of trial, legal counsel, etc.",

Granted, this is a hypothetical question not truly a practical one since we currently have no sure-fire way of testing a person's mental state. The reason I posed that question was to test YOUR reasoning for capital punishment.

Our purposes for punishment, if they are not to be based purely on the emotion of vengeance, need to have some RATIONAL reason for the punishment. I would include, among the rational reasons:\n 1. Protecting society from further harm by separating them from that society during their potentially harmful stage.\n 2. Teaching the offender a lesson so that he knows not to repeat the crime since he will see that the crime brings punishment, which brings him suffering.\n 3. Deterrent factor: Others see him suffer a punishment and know that they would also if they committed a similar crime.\n \n Those are the main rational reasons that I can think of behind having a society impose punishments to crimes.

If you design the system right, then that chance is nil or zero. However, there is also a chance that you \"got the wrong guy\" in the system and are putting the wrong person to death.

   "I would think that it would be an obvious point that we structure societies and civilizations in particular ways because there are REASONS to structure them that way. Are you saying that there is no reason to punish anyone - that is just the way it is and that's it? That makes no sense. If there is no reason to punish anyone to begin with, then why punish? I know that you MUST have reasons in mind - perhaps you are just unwilling to state them.\n \n All you have done is state a proclamation that all crimes must be punished, without giving any of your reasons behind that. I am claiming that vengeance is one of the reasons that people ultimately have for punishment. That is an emotional reason. There are also the rational reasons which I stated in my previous post. If you can give no reason why societies should punish crimes, then my guess is that your support of punishment for crimes really is based on the knee-jerk emotional reaction of vengeance and not on rational reasons. If you have rational reasons then please state them.\n\n Of course there are valid reasons to punish someone.\n \n 1. Removal (sometimes permanently) from society of a dangerous element, thereby preventing further crime by the individual and protecting the rights/interests of society. (If Billy Bob spends th next 25 years in prison, then I don't have to wonder if Billy Bob is going to be stealing my car for the next 25 years)\n \n 2. Show said criminal that their actions were unnacceptable to society, and therefore they must pay a penalty for their actions. (New York and LA have shown that catch and release is like simply telling a child that he is \"bad\" for stealing candybars in a store. The child will realize that 'hey...there are no consquences for stealing, so I'm going to keep stealing candybars. What's she going to do...call me bad again?' However, if you take said child back to the store, make him give the candybar back or the money for the candy bar, make him explain to the manager that he stole the candybar, and lock his playstation up for 3 weeks, the child might then say 'Hmmm, I really like to play my playstation, I'm not going to steal any more candybars...if I get caught again, mom might take my playstation away for even longer than 3 weeks.' )\n \n 3. Act as a detterent to future potential crimes/criminals. (see above)\n \n 4. Facilitate the rehabilitation of certain criminals, allowing them to gain education and job skills that they can then use on the outside. (punishment does not automatically mean that we cannot make something positive out of it. Certain offenders can and are rehabilitated in prison. Some simply require job skills, social skills, and life skills that can enable them to conform to societal norms (not stealing cars, selling drugs, robbing liquor stores, etc.) However this should not be seen as a substitute to punishment, rather a concurrent activity during the punishment. The criminals still have a debt to pay to society for their transgression of the laws. And by no means should one think that everyone is capable of rehabilitation, nor is every criminal deserving of efforts towards rehabilitation.)\n \n These are the first 4 that popped into my head. I'm sure that these could be combined into one mass reason, or picked down into 20 reasons, but it illustrates the point. There are plenty of reasons to punish criminals, none of which I listed have anything to do with vengeance.",

I take your remaining statements as facetious and see no reason to reply, but I will give you my answer to your last question. I do not view our joining the rest of the western world in abolishing the death penalty as \"down the slippery slope\", but instead consider it a step up. To me, there is no acceptable ratio of guilty/innocents put to death.\n My purpose was not to condemn our system, but to recommend a good book that shows what can and does happen, and the need for us to be aware. Our system is evolving and getting better as decisions such as Miranda and Brady come into law and advances in forensic science help to convict the guilty and protect the innocent, but, as humans are flawed, human systems are flawed and for that reason death should not be a state opinion.",

I would agree that, if we had a very good reason for killing, then some risk of innocents being killed might have to be acceptable. We have very good reasons for putting certain people away for the rest of their lives. Mainly, there are some people who are so very dangerous and unredeemable that society needs to protect itself from them - the risk of repeated crime is way too high. Given the strong reasons for imposition of life without parole for certain cases, the risk of an innocent suffering that would have to be acceptable. We just need to make as sure as possible that our justice system works as well as possible so we absolutely minimize that chance.\n \n My main arguement against the death penalty which I have presented in this thread is that, outside of satisfaction of the public desire for vengeance, there is no REASON to kill the offender.

Yeah, I know its a small risk but putting someone in solitary doesn't seem like a just punishment after a second murder.\n\n I think that criminals view the death penalty as worse than life imprisonment and worse than temporary solitary confinement within life imprisonment - at least given the conditions in American prisons. It is somewhat surprising to me but the statistics show that having the death penalty does not detter more criminals than life-without-parole itself. Indeed, on average, states with the death penalty have more murders per capita - probably because local economy is a higher differentiating influence. I suppose that, for most people, having to serve a life sentence without parole would already ruin their life enough that any who would be detered by fear of punishment are already detered.

Economics: In other words, the state shouldn't pay for such a worthless person.\n If this is what it comes down to, then that is a pretty miserable state of affairs.

You are not preventing jailbreaks just minimizing them by the tiny ratio of inmates who are death role - say ~0.01%.\n \n 7. Relieves prison overcrowding. Once again, 99.99% of prisoners are not death role so the effect would be negligible.\n \n 8. Prevents annual interviews with Geraldo Riverra. Ha Ha. NEXT...\n \n 9: Expediency. A life sentence is a de facto death sentence. Sentence a convict to life and it may take 60 years for the sentence to kill em. How barbaric when compared to the swift action of the lethal injection. The death penalty puts the life sentence into the fast lane. \n By that arguement, we are all sentenced to death. Those with a life sentence are just sentenced to spend their life in prison.",

If the reasons behind the DP, life without parole, or any other punishment methodology is sound, then any error that happens in the system - either killing an innocent or paroling a dangerous criminal - should be resolved by reforming the system to reduce errors, not by changing that punishment methodology. My main issue with the death penalty is that I don't think that the reasons behind it are sound.\n \n2. I understand that anti DP'ers debate because they are kind hearted.

I would expect that there would be terror of that criminal hurting them again. From that point of view, the death penalty would remove that particular terror. However, so would life without parole - as long as it is really done properly (no incompetent releasing dangerous criminals). It is a matter of having a system fail-safe enough that one could trust.\n \n As for the loss, nothing will bring that loved one back or, if it is a rape or other such violation, nothing will turn back the clock to undo the violation and the pain that goes along with it. \n \n I can understand the anger that would come if the criminal did not suffer any punishment and was allowed to go on his merry way. However, that is not the case. The question with the death penalty is not kill or give no punishment. Life without parole certainly IS a strong punishment - it ruins the life of the criminal. I just don't see why one needs to go all the way to death. If we have no limit to what punishment we are willing to inflict, then why not even torture before killing? I simply think that, if we wish to avoid a certain level of barbarism in our society, we need to stop at a place which is determined by reasoned debate.

Similarly, one of the reasons societies punish criminals is to teach them a lesson. Other reasons involve protecting society from them and using their punishment as a deterrent to others. You imply that punishment is automatically vengeance. I disagree and I think my example of the parent punishing the child proves it.\n\n Why is it that nothing is vengeance until it reaches the level of the death penalty? Why is the death penalty so different for you? Could a parent not punish their child out of an act of revenge, rather than to teach a lesson? Sure they could. Again, the whole argument between punishment and vengeance hinges on the motivation used in determining the severity of the punishment weighed against the severity and mitigating factors of the crime.",

   "We have covered all of this before in case you forgot. Please see post #160 if unclear on my position. It is a waste of my time to type it all out again for you.\n\n Since, in stating that no goals were necessary for a punishment, you seemed to step back for punishing for reasons, I am glad that you are reaffirming that punishments should be for reasons.\n \n So, in that post #160, you gave the following reasons for punishment:\n \n1. Removal (sometimes permanently) from society of a dangerous element, thereby preventing further crime by the individual and protecting the rights/interests of society. (If Billy Bob spends th next 25 years in prison, then I don't have to wonder if Billy Bob is going to be stealing my car for the next 25 years)\n \n 2. Show said criminal that their actions were unnacceptable to society, and therefore they must pay a penalty for their actions. (New York and LA have shown that catch and release is like simply telling a child that he is \"bad\" for stealing candybars in a store. The child will realize that 'hey...there are no consquences for stealing, so I'm going to keep stealing candybars. What's she going to do...call me bad again?' However, if you take said child back to the store, make him give the candybar back or the money for the candy bar, make him explain to the manager that he stole the candybar, and lock his playstation up for 3 weeks, the child might then say 'Hmmm, I really like to play my playstation, I'm not going to steal any more candybars...if I get caught again, mom might take my playstation away for even longer than 3 weeks.' )\n \n 3. Act as a detterent to future potential crimes/criminals. (see above)\n \n 4. Facilitate the rehabilitation of certain criminals, allowing them to gain education and job skills that they can then use on the outside. (punishment does not automatically mean that we cannot make something positive out of it. Certain offenders can and are rehabilitated in prison. Some simply require job skills, social skills, and life skills that can enable them to conform to societal norms (not stealing cars, selling drugs, robbing liquor stores, etc.) However this should not be seen as a substitute to punishment, rather a concurrent activity during the punishment. The criminals still have a debt to pay to society for their transgression of the laws. And by no means should one think that everyone is capable of rehabilitation, nor is every criminal deserving of efforts towards rehabilitation.)\n\n Of those reasons which you gave, which ones do you think cannot be accomodated by lesser senteces and NEED the death penalty?\n \n I know I had asked you a similar question earlier but you ultimately dropped the ball. Here is your response to essentially the same question, nested within my response to your response - our last exchange on this subject:\n \nIt doesn't quite work that way. You asked for reasons to justify punishment in general. I gave you reasons, although I suspect we all had these in mind before I wrote them down. These are reasons to punish people...plain and simple. The severity of that punishment is determined based on the facts of the individual case. \n \n We should look at the difference between vengeance and justice. As I had stated previously, I see the difference as the motivation for the punishment, and who the punishment is decided upon by. Sentencing someone to 20 years in prison could be an act of vengeance, just as easily as giving someone the death penalty could. But in most cases, I view the use of any punishment, when delivered through a fair and balanced judicial process as justice, not vengeance. As I said, killing the defendant on the courthouse steps without a trial by a jury of his peers would be vengeance. Carrying out a court sanctioned punishment as prescribed by law is justice, even when that punishment is death.\n\n But that is just a difference in logistics, not a difference in motivation. If a society imposes punishments for the wrong reasons - they are still wrong no matter what official means were used to reach that punishment. Many a law regarding slavery was ethically wrong because the REASONS underlying that law were wrong. The fact that the court actions had the full support of law was irrelevant ultimately to the morality of that court action.\n \n Here, I am questioning the REASONS behind capital punishment and the only one that I can see is public vengeance. You still have not given a REASON for capital punishment outside of that. You have given reasons for punishment in general but haven't applied those reasons to why one should incorporate capital punishment. \n \n By the way, I suspect that certain harsh punishments imposed on lesser crimes are also often imposed with vengeance also in mind. It is a hard thing to decide on the specific punishment for a specific crime for a specific individual. Judges have their work cut out for them in trying to be rational and fair.\n\n Perhaps you would like to finish that discussion now that was never finished. In that response, you seemed to back away from having punishments based only on reasons.",

I'm aware of murders that have occurred after an argument over 50 cents, or a pair of freakin' tennis shoes, or a dime bag of mediocre pot. You seem to value the murderer's life more than the victim's.\n\n There are many reasons for punishing criminals - teaching them a lesson, protecting society from them, using their punishment as a deterrent for others. In the practice of the death penalty, vengeance seems to be part of the reason (which I am also hearing in your responses) and that is what started my entry into this debate. Specifically, I started off in this thread by stating that vengeance seems to be the main motivating force behind the death penalty and, even though I would probably also want vengeance if a loved one was murdered, I remain quite uncomfortable with our justice system being based on such base emotional reactions. \n \n So, the question remains, why kill them if you don't need to. I am hearing two answers from you: (1) vengeance (they are so bad that they deserve to die..an eye for an eye...) and (2) you don't want to pay for them. If you accept vengeance as a reason for punishment then I understand why you would support the death penalty. I just want people to admit that it is vengeance that they are seaking and not stay in a state of denial - which many supporters of capital punishment seem to be in. Otherwise, if it is only a matter that you don't want to pay for them, then I should mention that the average capital punishment criminal costs more all together than does a lifer. Also, many criminals condemned to death would be willing to pay or work their own way through a life sentence (to pay for their own costs) rather than be put to death - so the state would not need to pay for them.\n \nAs for the welfare bums and poor people, they have committed no crime. They are not subject to any punishment by law. The law is what gives them the socialized gifts that enable them to continue their lives as welfare bums. I'm all for taking away the massive benefits, but I can't extend punishment to someone who is merely taking advantage of the liberal give-away programs. If they murder someone...they should die.\n I listed a number of people that society doesn't want to pay for but does. One group of people that I included in that list, which you ignored, were those who committted lesser crimes - ex. assault, or rape, etc. Where do you draw the line on which criminals you are willing to pay for (instead of kill) and which you want to kill to save money?",

   "There are many reasons for punishing criminals - teaching them a lesson, protecting society from them, using their punishment as a deterrent for others. In the practice of the death penalty, vengeance seems to be part of the reason (which I am also hearing in your responses) and that is what started my entry into this debate. Specifically, I started off in this thread by stating that vengeance seems to be the main motivating force behind the death penalty and, even though I would probably also want vengeance if a loved one was murdered, I remain quite uncomfortable with our justice system being based on such base emotional reactions. \nWhere do YOU draw the line between non-vengeful punishment and vengeful punishment? One might say that incarceration for any reason is vengeful. One might also say that making someone pay a fine is vengeful. Where do you draw the line? This argument for not having a death penalty could be extended to not having pumishment for any crime because there might be a touch of vengeance involved and don't want to appear to be vengeful.\n \n Call it vengeance if you will...I call it making the punishment proportional to the crime.\n \n \n \n\n So, the question remains, why kill them if you don't need to. I am hearing two answers from you: (1) vengeance (they are so bad that they deserve to die..an eye for an eye...) and (2) you don't want to pay for them. If you accept vengeance as a reason for punishment then I understand why you would support the death penalty. I just want people to admit that it is vengeance that they are seaking and not stay in a state of denial - which many supporters of capital punishment seem to be in. Otherwise, if it is only a matter that you don't want to pay for them, then I should mention that the average capital punishment criminal costs more all together than does a lifer. Also, many criminals condemned to death would be willing to pay or work their own way through a life sentence (to pay for their own costs) rather than be put to death - so the state would not need to pay for them.\n I listed a number of people that society doesn't want to pay for but does. One group of people that I included in that list, which you ignored, were those who committted lesser crimes - ex. assault, or rape, etc. Where do you draw the line on which criminals you are willing to pay for (instead of kill) and which you want to kill to save money?\nStrike out the vengeance argument because I don't consider being non-vengeful to be possible in distributing punishment. The money issue is valid.\n \n ...and I would extend the death penalty to murderers, rapists, child molesters, traitors and possibly a few more. (Assault would not be one of them unless it caused death or was a sexual assault on a child.)",

As for the execution of innocent convicted killers (rapists, child-molesters) I could be really hard-hearted and say it's just collateral damage...something I could live with.

I've seen papers presenting both sides.\n \n Another reason that any deterrent may be ocassionally ineffective in stopping a crime is that most criminals are likely not considering the punishment at the time of the crime. In the case of premeditated murder, they've likely thought of and dismissed it, thinking they're not to be caught or convicted.\n \n This brings up a possibility of my relenting on the execution of rapists and molesters.

Why have the state spend money to kill them when other prisoners will do the job for free?\n \n \nAnd for the record, financials are not important to me when considering any sentence, including death.\n\n \n Well, $1 billions, especially when it comes primarily out of county coffers (who never budget for it) is pretty damn important, especially when you consider what they have to cut to fund these cases. I'd rather have the county spend $150,000 on education in low income that helps prevent crime or on more cops then spend it to prove a guy shoud be executed. But I like prevention over damage control. \n \n \nRight. So are you saying that we are probably more sure about death penalty cases than we are about LWOP cases? In that case, I don't think we should be sentencing anyone to LWOP.\n\n \n No, we just spend more money to make us think we are more sure. Whether or not we are is something entirely different. Even though the requirements are higher, it doesn't actually MEAN we are proving it. Juries are notorious for ignoring specific information and guidelines. That's kind of a part of the broken system. A jury of your peers is often a jury of ignorant, biased XXXXXX. Merck is a example of this where the jury admitted to ignoring scientific evidence of what the drug didn't do just because they wanted to punish Merck. That's a broken system if you ask me. \n \n \nI'm not talking about the mid 70's - the 90's. I am talking about our modern day system.\n\n \n So am I. my point was that a mechanism for proving innocences takes time to be viable. Limiting appeals and shortening executions will almost invariably result in many innocents being killed before tech comes around to free them. \n \n \nUntil we come up with some sort of human tracking device or implanted chips that can tell us what someone was doing every day of their life\n\n \n well that would be beyond fascist...\n \n \nI think we have assured just about the highest level of accuracy we can. A little faith in the system, after all, it is good enough to sentence someone to LWOP. In for a penny, in for a pound.\n\n \n We can at the moment. As I have made my point, that changes.",

   "So how about we stop a penalty that has executed innocents? I'm more aganist the penalty because it costs so damn much over life. \n\n But it should not have to be like this. Eliminate the rediculous appeals, only admitting those based on substantial evidence that can change the outcome of the case. This alone will save vast amounts of money if you are concerned with that. Like I said, money is not a factor for me when it comes to punishment.\n \n \nLWOP can be reversed. The death penalty cannot. There's alot more work on freeing death row over LWOP because LWOP has time. \n\n The death penalty can be reversed. That's why there is an appeals process. What can not be reversed is the actual execution itself, but the condemned is given plenty of oppotunities to prove their innocence before they are executed. Given the scrutiny of death penalty cases, it seems that we would be more likely to lock someone up for life in prison and never uncover their innocence than we are to execute an innocent person. I don't call it collateral damage like Jim does, since I feel that this shows a general attitude of indifference that we cannot have when it comes to the death penalty. However, I do not see any moral difference in locking up an innocent person for 60 year or executing an innocent person. Again, consistency. \n \n \nActually the stated goal by many proponents is that it acts a deterrent. Essentially punishment is a deterrence. Problem is the Supreme Court stated the penalty is not a deterrent.\n\n Just because the supreme court issues an opinion on a subject does not make it fact, it is just that...an opinion. And how exactly do you measure deterrence? How are you going to know if detterence actually works, when the whole point of deterrence is that it prevents someone from doing the crime in the first place? \n \n \nNo, just stick them in prisons. Child Molester have a high morality (I take it you meant mortality) rate inside prison. Why have the state spend money to kill them when other prisoners will do the job for free?\n\n Oh...so it's ok that they get murdered, but it's not ok to implement a lawful prescribed punishment? Listen up AO, there's the difference between vengeance and punishment. \n \n Again, money is not an issue for me when it comes to punishing a criminal, regardless of what that punishment is. I'm willing to have my tax dollars go towards executing those found guilty of crimes and given the death penalty.\n \n \nWell, $1 billions, especially when it comes primarily out of county coffers (who never budget for it) is pretty damn important, especially when you consider what they have to cut to fund these cases. I'd rather have the county spend $150,000 on education in low income that helps prevent crime or on more cops then spend it to prove a guy shoud be executed. But I like prevention over damage control.\n\n Seperate issues. Sure, I support education, job training, crime prevention, and programs to keep people from going down the criminal path. But once they go down that criminal path, I am also willing to spend the money to punish them, even if that punishment is death. \n \n \nNo, we just spend more money to make us think we are more sure. Whether or not we are is something entirely different. Even though the requirements are higher, it doesn't actually MEAN we are proving it. Juries are notorious for ignoring specific information and guidelines. That's kind of a part of the broken system. A jury of your peers is often a jury of ignorant, biased XXXXXX. Merck is a example of this where the jury admitted to ignoring scientific evidence of what the drug didn't do just because they wanted to punish Merck. That's a broken system if you ask me. \n\n Again, I find no moral difference in locking an innocent up for life or executing an innocent. People use the argument that we should not execute people based on the possibility that they may be innocent, but they could care less if we lock someone up for life who may be innocent. Mistakes can be made both ways, and go uncorrected until the accused dies. Yet anti's continue to call for an end to the death penalty due to the possibility of these mistakes, gloss over the fact that we could just as easily lock an innocent someone up for life, and don't call for or initiate any plans to fix the system in the first place. Sad. \n \n \nSo am I. my point was that a mechanism for proving innocences takes time to be viable. Limiting appeals and shortening executions will almost invariably result in many innocents being killed before tech comes around to free them. \n\n What other tech? DNA evidence can be evaluated thoroughly in a few days. If you know of some other secret technology in development that could be used to determine guilt or innocence, speak up now. 5 years is way more than enough to gather evidence and make arguments based on said evidence.\n \n \nwell that would be beyond fascist...\n\n Absolutely.\n \n \nWe can at the moment.

This alone will save vast amounts of money if you are concerned with that. Like I said, money is not a factor for me when it comes to punishment.\n\n \n Seeing as our system is already broken as it is, doesn't it conclude that reducing the time in a broken system to possibly fix things would result in more innocents being convicted? There are plenty of cases where a innmate was convicted on a sole testimony and only after a huge amount of time passed did the testifier change their story and the innmate was let go. Granted that has changed in terms of requirements but you get the point. A broken system can be mitigated by giving the convicted time to at least try to prove their innocences.\n \n \nThe death penalty can be reversed. That's why there is an appeals process. What can not be reversed is the actual execution itself, but the condemned is given plenty of oppotunities to prove their innocence before they are executed. Given the scrutiny of death penalty cases, it seems that we would be more likely to lock someone up for life in prison and never uncover their innocence than we are to execute an innocent person.\n\n \n Yes and no. Gregg vs. Georgia and Furman Vs. Georgia kind of refute that argument as the justices's opinion argues aganist just that. Some states like California that is true where the state provides huge resources and mandatory appeals, but other states are not like that, Pre-Ryan Illionis for example. As for the life, I disagree, we don't uncover LWOP as much because fewer people are working on it. That guy is going to be there for a long, long time. Death isn't as time friendly.\n \n \nI don't call it collateral damage like Jim does, since I feel that this shows a general attitude of indifference that we cannot have when it comes to the death penalty. However, I do not see any moral difference in locking up an innocent person for 60 year or executing an innocent person. Again, consistency.\n\n \n Jim is also a Fascist. You'd expect that. I don't see the point of providing luxuries to innmates in life or death lockups for what they did, that seems pretty damn inconsistant. If I had my way, we'd have no death penalty except for rare cases, and have time in prison be cruel and usual with regular torture. Something kind of like the systems in Saudi Arabia and Iran with a way out of the torture part for showing real rehabiliation. That way inmates would have a HUGE incentive to rehabiliate and not go back to prison. Well, you could rehabiliate and become a successful member of society or you could face torture on a weekly basis. Incentives are the path to controlling human behavior. \n \n \nJust because the supreme court issues an opinion on a subject does not make it fact, it is just that...an opinion.\n\n \n True, but it does lend a huge amount of evidence towards that notion. \n \n \nAnd how exactly do you measure deterrence? How are you going to know if detterence actually works, when the whole point of deterrence is that it prevents someone from doing the crime in the first place?\n\n \n First of all, a dead man fears nothing. That's not a deterrence. Second of all, most of these kind of crimes are crimes done without thinking, bank robberies gone wrong. They didn't PLAN on killing someone. It just happened. The idea of the penalty is not in their mind. Now actual planning is something entirely different. We'd have to have something like a minority report to know just how many of those were planned and then stopped due to the potential punishments. Still, given how few of those there are, it doesn't seem likely that they are high in number. If you're serious about killing someone, you're going to do it law or no law.\n \n \nOh...so it's ok that they get murdered, but it's not ok to implement a lawful prescribed punishment? Listen up AO, there's the difference between vengeance and punishment.\n\n \n Not to many. The penalty is seen as vengence, why do they let families of the victims watch? \n \n \nSeperate issues. Sure, I support education, job training, crime prevention, and programs to keep people from going down the criminal path. But once they go down that criminal path, I am also willing to spend the money to punish them, even if that punishment is death.\n\n \n And what if the money that is spent to kill these people is directly taken from crime prevention?\n \n If you spend $1 million to kill someone, but that million comes from a program that stops tens of kids from going down in the first place, have you actually done a productive thing? Killing one man, but letting 10 more become murders is counterproductive. This is why the money matters. \n \n \nSad.\n\n \n Agreed, I just don't share their beliefs as to why the penalty should be stopped. It should be stopped and then reformed in to something useful. \n \n \nWhat other tech? DNA evidence can be evaluated thoroughly in a few days.\n\n \n If only that was true. There are a few labs in the US capable of doing this on the level law enforcement requires. These labs are also backed up by several years. Many DA's offices are limited to submitting only a few samples a month to these labs. It can be months, even years before results are sent back. The obvious solution is to expand the labs, but that isn't happening.",

Usually it's public defenders who are doing the job and they don't get anywhere near half of the salaries private attorneys get. And the few public defenders I know wouldn't want to do a death penalty case. Huge amount of time commitment. You don't see people able to pay such attorneys in such trials. \n \n \n???\n\n \n A innmate can request another appeal if they can provide significent new evidence. These evidence has to be sent though before the appeal is allowed to judge it is valid or useful. \n \n \nThere's actually a move on now to reduce the number of jurors required to vote for the death penalty...to make it 10 out of 12 or something like that\n\n \n That's a bad idea. It is easier to convince more people of a crime then it is of less. Proving to 24 different people that someone did do the crime is a feat close to removing all doubt. \n \n \nYour solution of pumping money into prison construction is also costly. \n\n \n Well my first alternative is the cheapest to just not jail non-vio drug users. but that's not going to happen. Therefore that doesn't leave much alteratives does it? Furthermore the status quo is hardly acceptable. Overcrowdings, escapes, guard murders....\n \n \nPlease explain \"thrown away without being executed\". You've already claimed that those who are unable to be rehabilitated should be killed.\n\n \n Just because you can be rehabiliated, the crime you may have done may have been so henius that society demands your removal, but not death. Some people will fit into that. \n \n \nI'm thinking you want those who can be rehabilitated to be released back into society to make more room in the prisons...or do you want to torture them every day until they die?\n\n \n Not everyday. That's expensive. Maybe once or twice a week tops. So instead of walking about the field for a couple hours, you get a hour of torture. You want to release rehabiliated prisoners into society so they can be a benefit to society instead of a drain.",

However, I do not believe that making life any easier for prisoners is the answer either. To tell you the truth, I do not know what action should be taken at the moment. We should be keeping the system the way it is until something realistic can be done. Blind speculation on what could be done would be unwise.

Organ donation:\n \n Why not, if it can be done safely, without harm to them and they can live without why not have immates tested to be donors. People who did nothing to deserve death might have a chance. Children who are poor and ended up in a doctors office at random, and it got to be more, it would do them good, if they got to live for someone gave them a kidney or a lung.

Society as a whole seeks justice, not revenge.\n \n\n \n So you are telling me if you are walking on the streets of your city and you walk into the wrong alleyway by mistake and see someone raping a seven year old girl who is crying, and then you watch them cut her throat. You wouldn't want vengeance?\n or if you hear about somone who used candy or a stuffed animal to draw a little seven year old girl away and then he rapes her and bruttally kills her? would you not want vengeance?\n \n \n \n Who in america didnt want vengeance for 9\\11? RELATED OR NOT/ \n I know I did and i was eight at the time, and i still do. My sister was close to the trade center and could of died but she didnt, and i dont know anione else who was killed in it but I still hate the people who stole mothers and fathers away from children. \n \n Nother example\n \n If on haloween some drunk highschoolers for the hell of it stalk junior high school kids and theres a confrontation and someone dies or the kids run into traffic , wouldnt you still want vengeance? \n I would\n \n \n \n \n \nAny mother who places her welfare ahead of the life of the child she was stupid enough to create does not deserve the right to make decisions. She's stupid.\n\n \n Oh yes its stupidyt if a single mother is raped by someone she knows or a stranger in her own home, and she goes along so to protect her current child?\n \n Or if a fourteen year old is in the wrong place at the wrong time and she goes in the wrong alley and some guy rapes her and she listens to the rapist because there is a knife at her throat?\n \n Or a five year old who gets raped by her step father or who gets lost at the park and wanders up to the nice man sitting by the bench who has candy and offers to help her find her mom if she will just get into his car?\n \n Or the 14, 15 or sixteen year old who has sex because she was not educated about it at all, and the guy is a good bit older and she isn't protected? OR even the young kids beneath 18 OR older and they use protection and it messes up, and don't find out she is p regnant till too late?\n \n Are they really stupid? \n \n Feel a bit foolish about now.\n \n \n \nWow, what? I though victims could only be intelligent life forms. I didn't know that anything made of organic material could be. Are the weeds in my garden victims too? I should have a funeral.\n\n \n Does that mean i;m guilty of murdering the ant i stepped on or the banana I ate? I should have a funeral with hearse and marching band and all and burial for the black widow spider , I asked my uncle to kill while I held his baby daughter(and the cousin who is like a sister to me) who is three, so she would not get bit?\n Do I need a burial for that spider?\n Three year olds are VERY inquistive , believe me , my baby cousin is and her twin brother is too but too a somewhat more moderate degree, i watch them for their parents so their parents can have some rest alot.\n \n \n \n \ndo do realize that if they do murder somebody while they are in prison, it will most likely be another prisoner, since the guards are armed? So you think the murder of a normal law abiding citizen deserves LESS of a punishment than the murder of a prisoner in prison? And you also think they deserve the death penalty for simply trying to escape? What if they don't kill anyone in their escape attempt? Do they still deserve the death penalty? So you are for the death penalty if a prisoner kills or attempts escape, but the normal run-of-the-mill citizen murder should only get life imprisonment? \n\n \n No if they have the chance to become a better person in prison and have time to think about how bad it was t hat they did and they still kill somone then maybe they have lost their chance\n \n \nIf you place a piece of cheese on the floor and a mouse comes and eats it, whose fault is it, the cheese's or the mouse's?\n \n\n \n OR YOURS YOU PUT THE CHEESE DOWN AFTER ALL< TEMPTING THE MOUSE AND SACRIFICING THE CHEESE?\n Do I need to have a funeral for the cheese than if it gets eaten?\n \n \n\n (If Billy Bob spends th next 25 years in prison, then I don't have to wonder if Billy Bob is going to be stealing my car for the next 25 years)\n\n Not if billy bob escapes than you have to wonder about it.

   "Dennis Fritz is a man who needs to be noticed more. His Book changed my views about the Death Penalty. He is the Other Innocent Man in John Grisham's The Innocent Man, he wrote a book called Journey Toward Justice Published by Seven Locks Press. A Companion book to The Innocent Man. Dennis Fritz writes his own story about unwarranted prosecution and wrongful conviction and is a true crime. Endorsed on Jacket by John Grisham which he states as Compelling and Fascinating.\n Journey Toward Justice is a testimony to the Triumph of the human Spirit and is a Memoir. Dennis Fritz was wrongfully convicted of rape and murder after a swift trail.\n The only thing that saved him from the Death Penalty was a lone vote from a juror. Dennis Fritz was the other Innocent man mentioned in John Grisham's Book. which mainly is about Ronnie Williamson, Dennis Fritz's co-defendant. Both were exonerated after spending 12 years in prison.\n \n The real killer was one of the Prosecution's Key Witness. Read about why he went on a special diet of his while in prison, amazing and shocking. Dennis Fritz's Story of unwarranted prosecution and wrongful conviction needs to be\n heard. Read about how he wrote hundreds of letters and appellate briefs in his own defense and immersed himself in an intense study of law.\n He was a school teacher and a ordinary man whose wife was brutally murdered in 1975 by a deranged 17 year old neighbor. On May 8th 1987, Five years after Debbie Sue Carter's rape and murder he was home with his young daughter and put under arrest, handcuffed and on his way to jail on charges of rape and murder.\n \n After 10 years in prison he discovered The Innocence Project, a non-profit legal organization. With the aid of Barry Scheck and DNA evidence Dennis Fritz was exonerated on April 15,1999 Since then, it has been a long hard road filled with twist and turns and now on his Journey Toward Justice. He never blamed the Lord and solely relied on his faith in God to make it through.\n He waited for God's time and never gave up.\n I can not add links at this moment But, For more information on Dennis Fritz and many issues in his book google me \"barbara's journey toward justice'.
