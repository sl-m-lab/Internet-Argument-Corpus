   "so we should thus stop developing ourselves militarily?\n\n \n IMO we should follow the rest of the world and put ourselves (US) in a defensive military posture. I don't see any major power in the world other than the US taking an aggressive military stance. We could reduce our military strength by 50% and still retain the capability of supreme defense based solely on nuclear warfare. Economics are the contemporary war, one that we're badly losing partially due to our out-of-proportion to tax base military commitment. \n \n I realize reducing US military capability would crash our economy, which brings up the question of now or later. Which is also the reason we continue our aggression as it feeds the GDP, that political gauge used to sooth the public and retain their confidence. Again; losing the economic war is a question of now or later. What surprises me is the lack of understanding by America's youth of their economic future being constructed as a house of cards consisting of public debt and trade deficits. If I were facing that, I'd be organizing political offense in no uncertain terms. Lack of personal responsibility seems to be the primary cause of that apathy. \n \n As to other whatever in the galaxy trouncing us, I agree with the other poster in that if they can get here and are aggressive, their technology makes any military resistance on our part pretty much a bad movie.",

Nothing fancy but, these figures are plastered everywhere currently for those who actually pay taxes...it being the middle of freaking April. \n \n The ONLY sites where I find the numbers you site are actually anti-government or anti-military sites.

SS administration is a budget line item.\" Which still means it's in the total budget. \n What you're tying to do is say the loose money that the government gets to play with and allot is the actual budget. The total of which is less than the governemnt takes in.\n Basically, You have $100 to spend. You say that that 100 isn't your 'budget' since you have to deduct $50 for rent and $10 for food. So you only have a budget of $40. Of that 40 you're saying you spend 50% on military...or $20. Yet, $20 is 20% of that 100 you recieved. Juggling numbers to inflate your claims. *note; numbers aren't hard data, just an example.\n And, it's more accuratly entitlement programs as I stated.

You're still useing human thinking to dictate how an 'alien invader' would invade. Hollywood and many sci-fi books often are humanocentristic. Heck, half the games I play and books I read are.

Yes its possible, and likely that an alien culture will develop differently than humanity, but FTL can not be the sole driving aim of any species that became dominate enough on a planet to have the resources at hand to create FTl vessels. So I am saying that if we are attacked by an alien species, we will not win, we may not lose, but we have no chance of victory, as we will be unable to strike at them, and they can choose to engage us at their leisure. I don't care how different your aliens may be, but no dominate species will choose to lose, otherwise they wouldn't have survived to become dominate, they may not think like us but that doesn't make them stupid.\n \n Back to my original post, we have yet to create a system that can reliably stop an object traveling at whatever speeds it is IBCMs travel at, so we need to advance our military, not enlarge it. A bigger military means more money being spent on trying to stay \"up-to-date\" which means that it will take longer for upgrades to reach the troops. If we are truly concerned about an alien invasion, than we should be reducing the size of the military not seeking to enlarge it and use it to achieve our expansionist goals.",

   "Regardless of different they may be from us, there is no reason a race that can traverse from solar system would choose to engage an enemy on their grounds under circumstances that would not favor their victory. Yes its possible, and likely that an alien culture will develop differently than humanity, but FTL can not be the sole driving aim of any species that became dominate enough on a planet to have the resources at hand to create FTl vessels. So I am saying that if we are attacked by an alien species, we will not win, we may not lose, but we have no chance of victory, as we will be unable to strike at them, and they can choose to engage us at their leisure. I don't care how different your aliens may be, but no dominate species will choose to lose, otherwise they wouldn't have survived to become dominate, they may not think like us but that doesn't make them stupid.\n\n \n Who ever said the aliens wern't stupid? In my scenario they are.\n Not only that, they opened their worm hole and stepped out in Amish country or 'the sticks' Africa. Saw some apparently 'primitive' people and decided to open the worm hole larger to move in. Turns out, their initial apprasals were wrong and the cunnin humans (lead by America of course) not only pull a Viet Nam victory (irony here) and defeat the aliens and then counter invade useing stolen worm hole technology. \n And, it doesn't take a lot of high technology to open a worm hole, just alternate technology...something we'd have discovered had we not decided to abort some super genius...but, we had to since his twin was that Histler dude that Nostrodamus talked about.\n This is a dumb (for humans) tangent. You could create a scenario about aliens impervius to radiation and blast...but very succeptable to potatoes. So, we'd best invest in potatoe guns. Just to be sure.\n FTL travel could simply be something humans haven't thought of yet other alien races have had since they could smelt copper. Seriously, most aliens don't even wear clothing if you've noticed (thinking the Greys who steal hillbillies), they can't be that advanced.\n \n \nBack to my original post, we have yet to create a system that can reliably stop an object traveling at whatever speeds it is IBCMs travel at, so we need to advance our military, not enlarge it. A bigger military means more money being spent on trying to stay \"up-to-date\" which means that it will take longer for upgrades to reach the troops. If we are truly concerned about an alien invasion, than we should be reducing the size of the military not seeking to enlarge it and use it to achieve our expansionist goals.\n\n The only thing an enlarged military seems to do is allow america to play world police and employ a bunch of people. Some good and some bad out of that.\n I personally could see trimming the military budget down. Even a 5% cut which is (according to what I find) 1% overall budget. Spend that money on reducing the deficit or education and infrastructure.\n I have no problems playing world police. Some do though. It could be our choice of targets are suspect. Would anyone complain if we went to the Sudan? \n As to enhancing our capabilities through R&D, we still get lambasted for that.

   "To quote Samuel Clemens \"It is better to remain silent and let others think you a fool, than to open your mouth and remove all doubt\" I'm not wasting any further time reading or responding to your post because my patience has run out.\n\n \n \n NOW you know how the other side feels.\n \n It's called mirroring. Basically, the opposition (you types) to general conservative types (and centrists) often state that they are open minded and willing to debate. The truth of the matter is often the opposite.\n Spew garbage and expect it to be returned.\n \n We go off on a silly tangent where you state a supposition as fact, Aliens being advanced enough to conqueor the earth simply because they can get here. For every plausable theory you tose out on this, I can counter....simply because it's of the realm of imagination.\n Basically, you lose. Because it's not even a valid debate. You state an imaginary scenario as fact. \n Something that a christian fundy (or any religious fundy) would push forward.\n \n So, getting past that nonsense, what part of my 2nd half of the post was worthy of dismissal?\n Do you want to win converts to the side of 'the military budget is too large' or simply make inflamatory remarks?\n As I said. \nask for compromises\n\n \n I approach in regards to trimming down the military budget in an initially conservative manner, thus, I approach the table to negotiate and honestly debate, and it appears you can't handle that since it undermines an ability to blithly make statements that don't have much substance and calls you to actual discussion. Heck, many anti-military web sites often state that a mere trimming of a small portion of the funds spent on the military would go a long way towards other, more worthy agendas. I open with a 5% cut slowly raised ofer the next 5 years. A subtle weening of the structure. You can't actually expect the military to go cold turky can you. After we get to the 5% mark, we can re-evaluate there and make further cuts as permissable.\n I say education would be a good source for those additional funds or towards the deficit. A smarter, more capable population can't be that bad. Or, infrastructure to further economic development so that we'll generate additional resources for further social agenda projects. \n I agree that the military has a lot of wastage. I also currently believe that the military can be put to a good use.\n \n The only thing I can think of that one would find offense is when I actually support some positions of anti-Iraq war types who say we should look at other countries where there is 'evil'. I suggested the Sudan. Cases of genocide there...oh, sorry, the UN doesn't call it that.\n I call into question how we can cut our military back without worrying about what other nations are doing. There are many non-democracies and despotic type regimes on the earth, can you guarantee that a weakened western world won't invite an invasion or beligerant attitudes?\n Why are they acts of genocide in the 3rd world? Is it because 'civilized' powers stand aside and simply don't care?\n Do you really care about the conditions of the rest of the world or only yours?\n It's what pro-americans get. We're accused of raping the resources of the less developed nations to further our life of luxury. I consider that to be a valid question. But, is the converse also true, that you chose not to be your brothers keeper and allow your fellow man to be ruled by tyranical nations who exploit the citizenry and strip the nation of resources...that they sell to your nation (or others) cheaply simply so a select few of those despotic nations can live in luxury.\n \n Let's go for Brians communistic paradise. You can play the role of the guy approaching the world in a passive manner with arms wide open. I'll play the role of the jerk who'll bash your head in with the butt of my rifle so I can save a bullet. I'll also take from you by force anything I can in the manner of a bully. If you're weaker and defenseless, you're fair game.\n Both types of humans exist. You can see them even in the most developed and civilized of nations. \n \n The moment all people are on the same page in the realms of social behavior and a sincear desire for peaceful coexistance, that's the day I'll jump whole heartedly into a socialist anarchist group.\n I have little problems with a communal existance in most regards.\n I do have a problem with people who are simply *******s (like I portray myself to be often) who'd try to get a free ride or be beligerant for no real good reason and seek to spoil everyones fun. Think of the bad drunks in some bars. \n \n \n When you simply dismiss someone else and say what you've said, you lose.\n Your ideas aren't worth pushing and you haven't the skill to do it if they were.\n In effect, all you desire to do is continue ******* in the wind. At least that's the message you're giving me. Which I'm cool with so long as it entertains you.\n \n \n As to what fracas said. Continue is NOT 'constant'. Subtle difference there.\n \n \n Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a Grey in the basement I haved to go torture for the secrets of worm hole technology and pyschically powered FTL drive powers. From what I gather, there's a symbiotic worm thingy that they insert into their brains that alters their equivelant of a pineal gland and allows them to manipulate copper in a teleportic manner. If I don't find the truth, I may have to experiment. Although the thought of inserting an alien worm up my nose isn't a pleasing idea, I'm sure the rewards are worth it. But, getting the worm out of his head will be a very unpleasant proceedure. Fortunatly, I have high tech power tools made by Craftsman. Craftsman, for all your power tool needs.

Along the lines of 'Well, if they can get here, they win, so we might as well do nothing.'???\n \n And there are probably billions of probably ways for aliens to get here. And there is absolutly NO evidence that they'll get here with high technology. Simply because we can't even guess the number of ways somethign ALIEN would work. You're still stuck with a humanocentristic notion when you keep harping on technology since that's the way humans do things. \n Now, if humas left the earth (say the Atlantans) and returned to reestablish themselves as dominant, then sure, I'd go with technology. But, for every tool using critter in the multiverse, there could be 1, 10, 1 billion or even 0 non-tool using critter. It's simply information we don't posses.\n So, being sensible, we know nothing. As such, stating in a factual manner that aliens will defeat us through technology is akin to saying my god is better than yours. Sure, it may be true but, we won't know until we get some further information...or, in the case of alien invaders, until it happens. Assuming that alien visitors many say visit are a hoax.\n \n \nIt may suprise you Zardoz, that recent breakthroughs have enabled people to predict events that might happen in the future even though they have not actually happened yet! A vast amount of these predictions, based off the current situation and things that have gone before are even right!\n\n Which ties into knowing details. Predictive thinking is based on knowledge. All we'd posses is that of what humans are capable of doing.\n If I can observe you for a short period of time, I can predict you behavior with some degree of accuracy. Just a knack for predictive psychology. Study your hand writting and determine what personality traits you have and thus what likely choices you'll make in given circumstances.\n \n One of the ironic things is the Viet Nam tangents and allusions that we recieve. That, for many a lower tech indiginious group can defeat a higher tech one. Somehow, that can ALWAYS apply to some western power (aka the US) but, it can't apply to them aliens. Where's my Custer? Where's my Zulu battles? Where's my Viet Nam? \n \n I've tried steering this tangent back on to the initial thread topic several times since it contributes little other than to say that the closed minded XXXXX such as myself live out of the box more than a liberal, open minded person would. \n But, I'm about 100% positive that when fracas said we needed our military to defend us from alien invaders, he was being flippant. Sarcasm doesn't always translate well on the net but come on, that was pretty off the wall comment to a supposedly serious thread about US militarism. Unless my thoughts are correct and this really isn't a serious thread...seeing as it opens with flame bait and has people closing down to discourse.\n \n \n So Tastyfish, what do you think about the US military budget?",

   "Not a lot, I certainly don't think that as a precautionary measure against possibly amish alien invaders its really up to it - though it would make area 51 interesting.\n \n I've not seen the figures for its percentage of government spending, or at least can't remember them, but in comparison to other countries I know its very high. I think Iraq has shown us that a lot of this money seems to be being wasted as the US army is neither particularly big and despite all this money still encounters a mass of problems with its training. \n \n Given that we are not including aliens in our list of threats now, probably the largest section of military budget (research of new weapons and equipment) should probably be scaled back and the money better spent on recruiting superior soldiers and training them better for the situations they are going to most likely encounter. \n \n Personally I think a lot of the military budget would be better spent socially but thats just me, however I also think that a combined military R&D budget for the US and its allies would be better though you are going to run into issues here.\n \n One thing though - how much does military R&D make from new patents? Apparently NASA makes quite a lot from discoveries made in the space race adapted to everyday use, is the mililtary the same?\n \n As for aliens - there arn't millions of ways to get here, there are very few which is what seems to be the problem.

   "Course if I turn up with High Elves against his Black Templars...\n\n \n \n What edition are we playing?\n \n I've seen a Dark Elf battle vs Marines back in 3rd ed fantasy/RTT (1st ed 40k) where the primitive elves kicked the space marines butts. That was when the rules were more compatable too...magic pwned.\n \n And I really think there could be as many ways to get across transgalactic / trans dimensional distances as there are alien races.\n They could litterlally be walking her right now. Yes, walking. Might be hard to imagine walking across several hundred light years of distance on foot but, all it takes is putting one foot in front of the other...and they started walking several zillion years ago, so they should be here soon. \n \n There's no good reason to expect that aliens would kick our butts when they arrive. Unless you think of them as human-like or similar.\n Geeze you lefty guys are so narrow minded and closed in your thought processes. Maybe that why you lose all the time. You can only convince the young of the rightness of your ways.\n \n Oh, and my interrogation of that alien grey is complet. I don't think the worm survived in my head that long. So, I decided to eat anything that remotly looked like a psychi organ. Pretty disgusting and no results. BUT, I think I can survive competing on Fear Factor, so, I'll chalk it up to funding. I'm also thinking on encaseing some of the aliens remains in glass and selling them on eBay as paperweights...extra fund raising.\n I was advised to sell them to the government but, seriously, they are broke and couldn't afford what I'm asking. Besides, I've seen al; the humanocentristic movies where the government screws over the little man. I may work for The MAN but, I'm not stupid (contrary to what many may think).\n \n \n Cause I'm board,\n \nAs for aliens - there arn't millions of ways to get here, there are very few which is what seems to be the problem.\n\n You really don't know how many ways there are of getting here. Just because humans are planet bound with limited exceptions doesn't imply all ofthers are. And there are untold stars in the universe plus the potential for alternate dimensions and other make believe stuff.\n \n \nIf some tool using species elsewhere has managed to find another waym then its a good bet that they have more technology due to a better understanding of the universe.\n\n Assumptions that are reasonable but, still centers on tool usage. Still no guarantee that, IF there are aliens that they rely upon tool usage.\n \n \nSeeing as we know vaguely what the universe is typically like I don't think we have really missed much on the way up. There isn't enough wierd gaps or unexplained phenonom in everyday life.\n\n And our understanding is limited by what we know, Human knowledge has greatly increased in the past 100yrs. While some things like psychic potential is pretty much dismissed in humans for example, it's still an idea that for all we know (next to nothing) is somethign that could be embodied in extrraterrestials. \n \nStill either the aliens got here through advanced tech, or they have access to powers and things we haven't even conceived of yet.\n\n A very reasonable conclusion yet still doesn't mean humans are powerless to their 'powers' that we don't understand. Primitive cultures didn't understand gun powder weapons by technologically advanced cultures that we invading yet, they were still able to defend themselves somewhat. In he human example, technological might often won out in the inevitable end. but, we don't know how an alien invada would respond to resistance from 'primitives'. \n \n \nAnd they are in space and are a militaristic race (lets ignore the pacifists who don't attack or completely screw it up as its their first go) so are in a good position with superior assets.\n\n Another assumption on them having superior assets. A common thought could be the human notion of logistics. Combining ideas, it could easily be that they just don't have the resources as they thought to prosecute the war as they initially thought. So, they come here with superior abilities that are limited in quantity. Turtledove and other sci-fi novelist have pondered this in depth. For example, those aliens walking here across the galaxy only have the numbers and items they transport themselves. And, while they don't need to eat or breath or even age (they're sleepwalking ;) ) they don't have enough to totally conqueor earth. Maybe if they got here 1,000 years sooner...\n \n \nWe would have to rely on them making some bad discions if we wanted to win or focus more on more pure research than military to start to get the weapons needed. With current military technology it would not be enough.\n \n Still assumptions. Sure, bad descisions would be nice but, they're ALIENS. For all we know, in the realm of human understanding, their rational discisions are, to humans, bad ones.\n \n Thus, as I've said several times, while they very well might be able to kick our butts, they might get their butts kicked by us.\n We know no variables. It's all make believe.\n Yet, if true, what are you going to do? I'd rather have a pokey stick than nothing even if a pokey stick still results in my defeat. Why? Because it brings me comfort. And that's what humans do quite often. Something that brings them comfort.\n \n \n And with that thought, I propose a 50% increase in military spending.\n This message brought to you by the good folks at the Military Industrial Complex Inc. Employing your daddy since the dawn of the nation.\n And from Nukes(tm). Because having them has solved every problem known to Man.\n \n Who needs the truth when you have a good logo?\n \n \n \n * Side note, I'm playing a SFB type game of glactic exploration and war and reading fan fiction by other players...why is it that when an alien race is contacted (and that alien race is locked in their own solar system due to a lack of knowledge of how to travel the intergalactic distances) that alien race often has fixed orbital defenses? Talk about a waste of money. Developing defenses for your planet from 'nothing that you've ever encountered or have any reasonable expectation of encountering'.\n I think it's chalked up to player knowledge over character knowledge. The player knows he'll encounter a hostile alien race even if the race (his character) doesn't.\n At least it makes for interesting battles. Beats, aliens show up, see no defenses and annihilates planet with anti-matter bombardment. War won. *yawn*\n \n \n \n Pie indeed.\n And what is cheese cake?\n Is it a pie of a cake or something else?\n Cheese cake, because stacking the odds in your favor, being a munchkin and general rules lawyer earns you a cry of cheese. Cheese cake, it's what's on the (game) table.",

   "Workers always pay more taxes togther than the rich\n That's demonstrably false in the USA - thanks to the progressive tax system and the number of astoundingly rich people, something like the richest 10% of the population in the USA pay 90% of the taxes. I'm sure Symbiote has the exact numbers somewhere. \n [quote]Their investment in war makes the rich richer by supplying weapons etc.\n \nI don't know any African businesses so only foreign ones profit.\n War can only be considered profitable if you subscribe to the 'broken window' fallacy of economics. There's a reason that people invest in stable economies in preference to unstable ones like in Africa. It's quite literally that war is bad for most business.\n \n Some businesses do apparently flourish during wartime, and particularly arms dealers supplying foreign conflicts appear to, but they flourish much like trees do in the artic - poorly in comparison to trees that grow in better conditions. \n \n It's a bit like the guys that wander around Halifax, where I live, collecting recycle-ables for a living. Sure, they're profiting from people's wasteful refuse, but really it's a waste of their time and effort considering what else they might be doing. \n \nGeeze you lefty guys are so narrow minded and closed in your thought processes. Maybe that why you lose all the time. You can only convince the young of the rightness of your ways.\n It's not really a case of brainwashed lefties so much as just regular people just doing what regular people do and not thinking critically about it much. \n \n I know plenty of 'lefties' that are older, that do think critically about their politics, and engage in centrist politics with their 'righty' counter-parts - it's radicalism of any political persuasion that's for the ignorant and the stupid.",
