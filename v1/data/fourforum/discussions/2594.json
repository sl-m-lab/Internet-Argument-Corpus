   "Hello everyone! I found a few good things that I would like to share with you.\n \n The following information is from a part of a physics textbook that I was given by my physics teacher titled &#8220;Planck, Einstein, Society and Politics&#8221;:\n &#8220;He [Einstein] had no particular politics and supported no government. He had moved out of Germany at a young age and most of his work was based in Switzerland. He became a Swiss citizen. Although of German descent, and working in Germany at the time [World War II], Einstein refused to sign the document supporting Germany&#8217;s war effort, instead signing a different document which called for a peaceful world. He was a pacifist, and did not accept that his work should contribute to the killing of others.\n \n This aspect of the science/society debate was emphasised after Adolf Hitler&#8217;s rise to power in Nazi Germany, mainly due to his ideology of Aryan purity. This resulted in all scientists of non-German descent being dismissed and their work being dismissed as not &#8220;true science&#8221;. In 1933, along with the works of many famous people, Einstein&#8217;s books were burnt in the streets of Berlin.&#8221;\n \n I would like you to draw your attention to the last paragraph of the quote. This is very similar to what many of you people do when creation scientists are mentioned. You dismiss them as being not real scientists, and likewise you dismiss their work as not being &#8220;true science&#8221;. Because their underlying assumptions are different to yours you accuse them of not being true scientists. Perhaps there is something to think about here? Are you people being like the Nazi&#8217;s were to non-German scientists? Personally, I think you are and I also think that many of you are honestly confused when it comes to defining science. \n \n Another attack that many evolutionists try to use is that evolution can change its theory but creationist cannot. Ken Ham recalls:\n &#8220;I once debated with a geology professor from an American university on a radio program. He said that evolution was real science because evolutionists were prepared to continually change their theories as they found new data. He said that creation was not science because creationists&#8217; views were set by the Bible and, therefore, were not subject to change. I answered, &#8220;The reason scientific theories change is because we don&#8217;t know everything, isn&#8217;t it? We don&#8217;t have all the evidence.&#8221;\n &#8220;Yes that&#8217;s right,&#8221; he said.\n I replied, &#8220;But, we will never know everything.&#8221;\n &#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; he answered.\n I then stated, &#8220;We will always continue to find new evidence.&#8221;\n &#8220;Quite correct,&#8221; he said.\n I replied, &#8220;That means we can&#8217;t be sure about anything.&#8221;\n &#8220;Right,&#8221; he said.\n &#8220;That means we can&#8217;t be sure about evolution.&#8221;\n &#8220;Oh, no! Evolution is a fact,&#8221; he blurted out.\n He was caught by his own logic. He was demonstrating how his view was determined by his bias. Models of science are subjected to change for both creationists and evolutionists. But, the beliefs that these models are built on are not. The problem is that most scientists do not realize that it is the belief (or religion) of evolution that is the basis for the scientific models (The interpretations, or stories) used to attempt an explanation of the present. Evolutionists are not prepared to change their actual belief that all life can be explained by natural processes and that no God is involved (or even needed). Evolution is the religion to which they are committed&#8230; Evolution is a religion; it is not science!&#8221;\n \n I have heard many people &#8211; especially on this forum &#8211; say that creation is the religious view and evolution is the &#8220;scientific&#8221; view as to how we got here. But how accurate is this? Firstly, can we use the Scientific Method (that many of you appear to hold so high in science) to scientifically test and observe things that happened millions of years in the past? Of course we can&#8217;t! I found a great part of Ken Ham&#8217;s book titled &#8220;The Lie: Evolution&#8221; that accurately describes what science is and how evolution is not science, but a religion. He says at the start of Chapter 2 titled &#8220;Evolution is Religion&#8221;:\n &#8220;However, because the majority of evolutionists are not Christians, I wish the reader to understand that the term &#8220;evolutionist&#8221; is used to mean those who believe that evolution &#8211; in the sense of time, chance, and struggle for survival &#8211; rather than the God of the Bible is responsible for life.&#8221;\n He goes on,\n &#8220;The Autumn 1985 (Vol. 2, No. 5) issue of &#8220;The Southern Skeptic&#8221; (the official journal of the South Australian branch of the American Skeptics &#8211; whose aims are similar to American humanist groups), devoted its entire 30 pages to an attack on the creation science ministry in Australia and the United States. On the last page we read the following: &#8220;Even if all the evidence ended up supporting whichever scientific theories best fitted Genesis, this would only show how clever the old Hebrews were in their use of common sense, or how lucky. It does not need to be explained by an unobservable God.&#8221; These people who vehemently attack the creation ministry in saying we are a religious groups are themselves a religious group. They have really said that even if all the evidence supported the Book of Genesis they still would not believe it was an authoritative document. They are working from the premise that the Bible is not the Word of God [as are many of you evolutionists], nor can it ever be. The believe, no matter what the evidence, that there is no God [like many of you]. These same people are most adamant that evolution is a fact [sound familiar?;-)]. \n \n Evolution is basically a religious philosophy. We in creation ministries are explaining to people that both creation and evolution are religious views of life upon which people build their particular models of philosophy, science, or history. The issue, therefore, is not science versus religion, but religion versus religion (the science of one religion versus the science of another religion).&#8221;\n And his justification for that statement:\n &#8220;It does not take much effort to demonstrate that evolution is not science but religion. Science, of course, involves observation, using one or more of our five senses (taste, sight, smell, hearing, touch) to gain knowledge about the world, and to be able to repeat the observations. Naturally, one can only observe what exists in the present. It is an easy task to understand that no scientist was present over the suggested millions of years to witness the supposed evolutionary progression of life from the simple to complex. No living scientist was there to observe the first life forming in some primeval sea. No living scientist was there to observe the big bang that is supposed to have occurred 10 or 20 billion years ago, nor the supposed formation of the Earth 4.5 billion years ago (or even 10,000 years ago!). No scientist was there &#8211; no human witness was there to see these events occurring. They certainly cannot be repeated today.\n All the evidence a scientist has exists only in the present. All the fossils, the living animals and plants, the world, the universe &#8211; in fact, everything &#8211; exists now, in the present. The average person (including most students) is not taught that scientists have only the present and cannot deal directly with the past. Evolution is a belief system about the past based on the words of men who were not there, but who are trying to explain how all the evidence of the present (that is, fossils, animals, and plants, etc.) originated [Not how they operate &#8211; both creationists and evolutionists are in complete agreement about that &#8211; it is where they came from and how they came to be that we argue about]. \n \n Webster&#8217;s Dictionary defines religion as follows: &#8220;Cause, principle or system of beliefs held to with ardor and faith.&#8221; Surely, this is an apt description of evolution. Evolution is a belief system &#8211; a religion!&#8221;\n \n On page 24 Ken talks about biases. He says the following:\n &#8220;Many think of scientist as unbiased people in white laboratory coats objectively searching for the truth. However, scientist come in two basic forms, male and female, and they are just like you and me. They have beliefs and biases. A bias determines what you do with the evidence, especially the way in which you decide hat certain evidence is more important than other evidence. Scientists are not objective truth seekers; they are not neutral. Many people misunderstand bias, thinking that some individuals are biased and some are not. Consider an atheist, for example. Such a person believes there is no God. Can atheists entertain the question, &#8220;Did God create?&#8221; The answer is, &#8220;No&#8221;. As soon as they even allow it as a question, they are no longer atheists. So, to an atheist scientist looking at the fossils and the world around him, it would not matter what evidence he were to find. It could have nothing to do with Biblical events, such as Noah&#8217;s Flood. Even if he found a big boat on the top of Mount Ararat he could never allow that evidence to support the claims of the Bible regarding Noah&#8217;s ark. As soon as he did, he would have abandoned his atheistic framework. An atheist is 100% biased. This should be kept in mind whenever one reads a textbook or sees a television program produced by an atheist.&#8221; He goes on, &#8220;An agnostic is 100% biased. He believes one cannot know anything for sure, so, no matter how much evidence he hears, he can still say, &#8220;I do not know&#8221;. As soon as he knows, he has stopped being an agnostic. But what about a revelationist, i.e. a person who believes that the God of history has revealed the truth about Himself by means of a Book? Can such a person consider the opposite question, that God did not create? No! Because he starts with the premise that God is Creator and His word is true. Atheists, agnostics and revelationists (and theists) hold to religious positions; and what they do with the evidence will again be determined by the assumptions (beliefs) of their religious positions.&#8221; So it is not really a matter of who is biased and who isn&#8217;t biased, as many of you evolutionists suggest. We all have our own beliefs on how we got here, we are all 100% biased. Silent Poet&#8217;s &#8220;always keep an open-mind&#8221; is false. Everyone is biased and as a result we can&#8217;t really believe what others say. For example, I will never be convinced that evolution is true, because I am 100% biased. Likewise, an evolutionist will not believe creation is true, no matter how much evidence is presented, as he/she is 100% biased.\n \n So in summary, all scientists have their own biases and evolution is a religion, or the science of a religion (as is creation).",

   "Because their underlying assumptions are different to yours you accuse them of not being true scientists.\n\n Wrong. A creationist says \"OK, here's our conclusions. What facts can we use to back it up?\" A scientist says \"Ok, here's the facts. What conclusions can we draw from these?\"\n \n See the difference?\n \n \nAnother attack that many evolutionists try to use is that evolution can change its theory but creationist cannot. \n\n They can't. Why else would they still be claiming there was a global flood 4500 years ago? Two very quick points refute this claim: no flood evidence (geological or fossil) and there were a number of cultures around then with pretty detailed records that extend through the supposed flood.\n \n \n \nKen Ham recalls:\n \"I once debated with a geology professor from an American university\n\n Wow, he sure caught him there, didn't he? So well in fact that he doesn't note the name or the university he taught at. Not to mention the fact that debating a geology professor on evolution is like debating an MD on chemistry.\n \n \nThe problem is that most scientists do not realize that it is the belief (or religion) of evolution \n\n It's not a religion. Really people, it's not that hard. There's no supreme beings, no services/rituals, no rewards, no punishments, etc, etc. All this is trying to accomplish is to reduce the ToE to the level of creationism so that creationists can pitch the idea of \"equal time\".\n \n \nFirstly, can we use the Scientific Method (that many of you appear to hold so high in science) to scientifically test and observe things that happened millions of years in the past? Of course we can't!\n\n Of course we can! The idea that you have to see something first hand to know it happened is ridiculous. Or should we release every prisoner who has been convicted using forensic evidence?\n \n \nHowever, because the majority of evolutionists are not Christians\n\n Does he have numbers to back this up? My guess is no, since it's false. \n http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA602.html\n And there is no such thing as \"evolutionism\". Just as there is no such thing as \"gravityism\".\n \n \n\"The Autumn 1985 (Vol. 2, No. 5) issue of \"The Southern Skeptic\"...<snip rest of conspiracy theory<\n\n First off, science can say nothing about god, so if all the evidence supports the bible, the only scientific alternative left is \"those Hebrews were smart\". The religous alternative in this situation would be \"see, the bible is right, and there is a god\".\n Secondly, you have yet to prove that most scientists are atheists, or humanists. Gup tried this as well. It don't work.\n \n \nNaturally, one can only observe what exists in the present.\n\n And I just spent all that money on a new camera. Pity.\n \n \n\"Cause, principle or system of beliefs held to with ardor and faith.\" Surely, this is an apt description of evolution. Evolution is a belief system - a religion!\"\n\n Wow, this definition is so loose it would describe hobbyists, patriots, sports fans, etc. Care to try again?\n \n \nHowever, scientist come in two basic forms, male and female, and they are just like you and me. They have beliefs and biases. A bias determines what you do with the evidence, especially the way in which you decide hat certain evidence is more important than other evidence.\n\n Yawn. Peer review. Ever hear of it? Scientists will rip apart research looking for the flaws in it. Anyone who can show that a currently accepted theory is false is looking at going down in the history books (Einstein ring any bells here?)\n \n \nCan atheists entertain the question, \"Did God create?\" The answer is, \"No\".\n\n Except he has yet to show that the majority of scientists are atheists. False premise, false conclusion.\n \n The rest of this is simply an attempt to make creationism seem as valid as science (like the rest isn't?)\n \n Here's an example of what I mean (Courtesy of Kronus)\n \n \nLet me pose a hypothetical here. You and I are summoned to a room, in which we find a man standing next to a table, upon which sits a regular shoe box. He invites us to guess what is in the box, but we're not allowed to look inside. You go over to the box, heft if in your hands, shake it, listen to it, sniff it. I give it a quick glance. He then asks us what we think is inside. You say \"A brick. The box weighs what a brick should, when I shake it the object inside feels rectangular, and I noticed on the way in that there is a brick missing in the wall outside, and it looks like it was recently taken.\" The man then looks at me, and I say \"An elephant. A full grown adult male African elephant.\" In response to his bemused expression I shrug and say \"I like elephants.\"\n \n\n Bias can only explain so much. Evidence makes up the majority. Where's yours?",

   "While it's possible that scientists call creation science \"bad\" due to some Nazi-esque persecution, let's not disregard that possibility that they do so because it is bad science.\n \n So, what is science? A religion? No. The definition you provide is the last one listed in dictionary.com. All the other defintions, as well as the usage people use in everyday parlence, involve belief in a diety or spiritual power. Using the least common defintion just to make a point is a bit disingenuous.\n \n So then, what is science? Is it a philosophy? That might not be a bad way to look at it. It is a system of thought based on certain axioms. For example, the univere exists in a real sense. Our senses can give us real information about the universe. Cause and effect is a real phenomema. These are the foundations upon which science is built. Now, what about \"everything can be explained\"? Or, to put it another way, \"There are no supernatural causes\". Certainly alot of scientists believe this, especially if you phrase it the second way. And certainly alot of things which used to be explained by the supernatural have in fact been found to have more mundane causes. However, this is not a tenant of science. Any good scientist will, when presented with something that doesn't submit to mundane explantion, say \"I don't know. I can't explain that.\" They may go on to try to find a mundane explantion; that's their job after all. But nowhere in any scientific presentation is a lack of belief in the supernatural required.\n \n As for your claim that science can say nothing about what happened in the past; that's simply not true. Science looks at evidence and draws conclusions. Naturally first hand reproducible evidence is the best sort, but it's not the only type allowable. Consider: I find a puddle of hot coffee on the ground, with a mug in the middle of it. Just above the puddle is a table edge, where I see a cat sitting, licking its paws. Now, whatever happened, happened in the past. No one saw it, and we can't reprodude the events in a lab. However, given what we know about cats and gravity, we can be pretty sure the cat knocked the mug off the table. Likewise, we can look at physical evidence and make reasonable deductions about what went on on the Earth in the past, either 10,000 or 10,000,000 years ago. \n \n Finally, about your assertion that once someone has a certain mindset, they can't even entertain a premisis that contradicts it. If that's true we might as well all give up and throw in the towel now. Thankfully, it's not true. What you're talking about is fanatisism. Sure fanatics exist, but they aren't the majority. Most people can at least entertain a hypothetical case where there beliefs aren't assumed. From what I've heard about Ken Han, I suspect he may be a fanatic, and is projecting his fanatisism on the rest of the world.\n \n P.S. TQ, the elephant bit was mine. Glad you liked it.",

   "There are several fallacies with Darwin's theory of evolution:\n\n Great! At least someone is going to make some definite statements. We can only hope that some evidence is presented to support those assertions.\n \n(1) Evolution supposedly explains the \"creation\" of all things in terms of present processes, but the first law of thermodynamics says that nothing is now being \"created.\"\n\n Evolution doesn't explain the \"creation\" of anything. The theories of evolution explain the causes for the changes in the heritable makeup of populations of living organisms.\n \n Thermodynamics is physics and not evolutionary biology. The first law of thermodynamics states that the total energy of a closed system is constant. I'm not sure what you thought it was. If the law is correct, then any claim of creation ex nihilo violates that law. However, evolution makes no such claim.\n \n(2) Evolution presupposes an innate tendency towards progress and increasing order and complexity in the universe, but the second law of thermodynamics proves there is an innate tendency towards decay and disorder in the universe.\n\n Wrong again. There is no such presupposition. First you are going to have to define what you mean by progress and complexity. Further, evolution does not deal with the universe but only with populations of living organisms. And the second law of thermodynamics doesn't prove anything. It is an observation that has held true in all cases. You have also confused clasical thermodynamics with statistical thermodynamics, and you have clearly misunderstood the concept of entropy.\n \n Just to check on you knowledge, please take the following thermo test to assure us that you know what you are talking about. This stuff is covered early in a 1st semester college course. Thermo Test I'm sure that my friend gallo won't mind a reference to his test.\n \n(3) Evolution supposedly is brought about by gene mutations, but almost 100% of all known mutations are harmful or even fatal to the creatures which experience them.\n\n Actually, most mutations are silent since most mutations occur in the junk DNA of the genome - that is, the more than 90% of the genome that doesn't code for any protein and has no function in control. However, even if a mutation occurs in the coding part of the genome, almost 1/3 of the point mutations are harmless and result in no change whatsoever in the specific amino encoded. Would you like to learn about the 64 possible combinations of triplets of 4 different bases encode the 20 amino acids that make up all proteins found in living organisms?\n \n But, even though most mutations are harmless (estimates are that every individual has between 10 and 100), many are deleterious, and a few are beneficial. Some that may appear deleterious may turn out to be beneficial in a given environment. Thus, if a mutation isn't lethal, it is the effects of the environment that will determine the fate of the organism and the mutated gene.\n \n Also, evolution is brought about by changes in the frequency in alleles in a population of organisms over time. Mutations are not necessary although mutations are one mechanism that increases genetic diversity. There are other mechanisms that increase diversity and yet others that reduce it. All \"bring about\" evolution.\n \n(4) No example of true evolution from one basic \"kind\" into another \"kind\" is known either in the present world or in the fossil record of the past.\n\n What is a \"kind\". Of course, since evolution is such a slow process, taking place over geologic time, no one would ever see such a thing. But we do have examples in the geologic record of animals that have adapted to new environments. Thus we have fossils of whales with legs and dinosaurs with feathers. And there have been several observations of the development of new species. We have discussed several that can be observed to be in process right now. Would you like to learn about them?\n \n(5) Evolutionary kinship of all creatures would imply a continuous intergrading of all forms of life, but both present life and the records of past life show great gaps between all the different kinds of plants and animals.\n\n Actually it doesn't. Although there are gaps, they are to be expected. Fossilization is an exceedingly rare event. Some environments are better for fossilization than others. But even though the geologic record is imperfect, it still reveals a phylogenetic tree that points to the unity of life. Even Carolus Linnaeus recognized the phylogentic tree and grouped living things acccodingly.\n \n But did you know that all living things use almost exactly the same genetic code made up of the same 4 nucleotides, that encode the 20 same amino acids that even have the same chirality? Just what one would expect if all life had a common ancestor.\n \n(6) Natural selection supposedly accounts for the development of new kinds, but actually tends to preserve the present kinds, since an incipient organ or new feature of any kind would have no \"survival\" value unless it were fully functional from its very beginning.\n\n Sometimes natural selection does act to preserve the status quo, especially in large, old, well established populations. As long as the environment is stable, the organisms will tend to be well adapted. However, if you change the environment, evolution will happen or the organism will go extinct.\n \n How do you determine that some new feature would have no survival value? What do you mean by \"fully functional?\" So what you are saying is that in a cold environment an organism that developed a filamentous covering would not have any survival advantage? What if the filaments kept it warmer? What if the filaments allowed the organism to maintain a constant body temperature?\n \n What you are saying just doesn't make sense. What if a feature originally had a different function? And why does it have to be \"fully functional?\" Wouldn't it be enough to offer just a little advantage?\n \n(7) Evolution contradicts the scientific law that no effect can be greater than its cause, since it assumes that intelligence was developed from non-intelligent matter, that morality was evolved from non-moral processes, that love and other emotional qualities came out of unfeeling chemicals, that infinitely complex structures arose from simple beginnings, and that spiritual consciousness began out of inert molecules.\n\n Well, evolution makes no assumption about morality, love, or other emotiions. And I've never heard of that scientific law. In what field of science might I find it and who was the scientist that first stated it.\n \n I guess that you feel that the mythology of ancient nomadic herdsmen is better. One should believe in creation stories and reject the observations of God's creation that can't be twisted into that story.",

   "Evolution doesn't explain the \"creation\" of anything. The theories of evolution explain the causes for the changes in the heritable makeup of populations of living organisms.\nThe term \"evolution\" is an oxymoron. The reality of genetic adaptability, doesn't equate with Darwin's fantasy. Every prototype genome possesses inherent genetic adaptability that assures a kaleidoscope of descendant diversity. Some public minds mistakenly confuse the reality of nature's genetic dynamism with evolutionism's make-believe. Human DNA carries 3+ billion base pairs. Two human parents possess the capacity to produce 70 trillion variations in their children. Darwin's Galapagos finches produced offspring endowed with different shaped beaks---but 21st century Galapagos finches still fly as finches! Fruit flies, subjected to laboratory induced mutations, may add or subtract wings and legs but continue producing fruit flies, ad infinitum---never butterflies nor dragonflies! Extrapolation doesn't mend the flaws and holes of Darwin's rag of an hypothesis.\n \n \nWrong again. There is no such presupposition. First you are going to have to define what you mean by progress and complexity.\n Contrary to the gradual, incremental \"progress toward perfection\" conjectured by Darwin's mega-evolution, thousands of fully formed, intelligently designed and irreducibly complex life forms appeared abruptly, simultaneously and world-wide, without persuasive fossil evidence of prior ancestry. This Cambrian Explosion defies the anchor premise of Darwinian conjecture. Also noteworthy of Darwins theory is the mistakenly viewed single-celled, organic life forms as \"simple.\" A blob of protoplasm! In reality, a living cell is vastly more complex than the most sophisticated man-designed mechanism. No human laboratory has duplicated what random chance allegedly accomplished in some still unidentified, \"prebiotic soup.\" No evidence exists that original life defied impossible odds to create itself by spontaneous generation. NEVER!!!\n \nActually, most mutations are silent since most mutations occur in the junk DNA of the genome - that is, the more than 90% of the genome that doesn't code for any protein and has no function in control.

Would you like to learn about the 64 possible combinations of triplets of 4 different bases encode the 20 amino acids that make up all proteins found in living organisms?\n Mutations are rarely beneficial. Mutations usually degrade the genome and trigger information loss. These genetic defects do not introduce new information to the gene code. Nor do genetic defects represent an incremental step in a mythical leap to some radical new organism. Variety potential, inherent within the dynamic genome assures genetic adaptability but not some quantum leap to some radically new prototype life. Neo-Darwinism ignores this scientific reality and relies on billions of mutations, combined with natural selection, as the source of every kind of life on earth after that first life cell. \n \n \nWhat is a \"kind\". Of course, since evolution is such a slow process, taking place over geologic time, no one would ever see such a thing. But we do have examples in the geologic record of animals that have adapted to new environments. Thus we have fossils of whales with legs and dinosaurs with feathers. And there have been several observations of the development of new species. We have discussed several that can be observed to be in process right now. Would you like to learn about them? \n The genetic system of each \"kind\" of living creature were sufficiently complex to permit the later development of many variations within it, but the basic \"kind\" was fixed by God in creation. The second law of thermodynamics doesn't track with Darwin's speculative progress toward perfection. Given 4.55 billion years, the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics impacts the precise opposite of what evolution requires. Entropy's deterioration and decline is the inevitable consequence in nature. Homo sapiens age, grow weak and die; trees lose their leaves and die; cars rust; buildings crumble; mountains erode.\n \n \nActually it doesn't. Although there are gaps, they are to be expected. Fossilization is an exceedingly rare event. Some environments are better for fossilization than others. But even though the geologic record is imperfect, it still reveals a phylogenetic tree that points to the unity of life. Even Carolus Linnaeus recognized the phylogentic tree and grouped living things acccodingly. \n Evolutionism requires billions of incremental steps to bridge the gaping genetic chasms between organic prototypes: single cell-to-fish-to- amphibian-to-reptile-to-bird and mammal and eventually, to-man. After billions of fossil discoveries, where is the evidence of Darwin's \"...innumerable transitional forms...\"? Certainly not in today's living natural world. As to the miniscule number of fossil forms categorized as \"transitional,\" they represent just another extinct species. So-called \"intermediates\" carry the label because an evolutionist has declared it, not because of irrefutable proof of genetic linkage as between old bones. Neither homology nor morphology equates genealogy. \n \n \nBut did you know that all living things use almost exactly the same genetic code made up of the same 4 nucleotides, that encode the 20 same amino acids that even have the same chirality? Just what one would expect if all life had a common ancestor. \n A cell's proteins require \"left-handed,\" amino-acid building blocks. DNA & RNA use only \"right-handed\" building blocks. Natural forms come in a 50-50 mixture. Evolutionism's random chance explains neither the cause nor the discriminating process that mandates selection of left-handed v. right-handed building blocks. \n \n \nHow do you determine that some new feature would have no survival value? What do you mean by \"fully functional?\" So what you are saying is that in a cold environment an organism that developed a filamentous covering would not have any survival advantage? What if the filaments kept it warmer? What if the filaments allowed the organism to maintain a constant body temperature?\n A partially evolved body part would render any alleged \"transitional\" severely handicapped. A critter saddled with an appendage half-leg and half-wing couldn't fly or walk efficiently. An incrementally evolving eye would hardly contribute to fitness or survival. Dr. Michael Behe illustrated the problem by referencing a simple mousetrap with a single missing part---no mouse need fear, the trap couldn't function!\n \n With respect to the often-repeated claim that scientists universally believe in evolution, there are today thousands of qualified scientists who are thorough-going Biblical creationists. For example, the Creation Research Society, organized in 1963, has a membership of over 700 such scientists, each with at least an M.S. degree, representing literally every field of modern science, and each believing in the special creation.",

Some areas of the chromosomes encode genes. Any two individuals can have at most only 4 different forms of any gene. In any case where there exists more than 4 alleles of any gene in a population means that it arose by mutation. That is a fact.\n \nDarwin's Galapagos finches produced offspring endowed with different shaped beaks---but 21st century Galapagos finches still fly as finches!\n\n But they aren't grass quits.\n \nFruit flies, subjected to laboratory induced mutations, may add or subtract wings and legs but continue producing fruit flies, ad infinitum---never butterflies nor dragonflies! Extrapolation doesn't mend the flaws and holes of Darwin's rag of an hypothesis.\n\n You don't seem to understand even the basics of genetics or evolutionary theory. It is a fact that strains of fruit flies that are maintained to supply laboratory stock have speciated several times.\n \nContrary to the gradual, incremental \"progress toward perfection\" conjectured by Darwin's mega-evolution, thousands of fully formed, intelligently designed and irreducibly complex life forms appeared abruptly, simultaneously and world-wide, without persuasive fossil evidence of prior ancestry.\n\n Wow! So many errors in so few words. First, Darwin did not propose \"progress toward perfection.\" Darwin tried very hard to combat that idea. \n Darwin proposed that organisms would change to become adapted to their environment by means of the differential reproductive success of individuals with heritable, advantageous characteristics. Further, there is quite persuasive evidence of prior ancestry to the Cambrian organisms.\n \nThis Cambrian Explosion defies the anchor premise of Darwinian conjecture.\n\n What premise is that?\n \nAlso noteworthy of Darwins theory is the mistakenly viewed single-celled, organic life forms as \"simple.\" A blob of protoplasm!\n\n Nope. Darwin never said that. Have you actually educated yourself about Darwin's theory? Perhaps actually read Darwin? Or maybe a text on evolutionary biology?\n \nblah, blah random chance blah, blah spontaneous generation. NEVER!!!\n\n I thought you were talking about evolution. What does random chance have to do with it? Spontaneous generation was the belief that vermin arose in dead organic matter - rats in piles of garbage, maggots on rotting meat. What does that have to do with evolution?\n \nMutations are rarely beneficial. Mutations usually degrade the genome and trigger information loss. These genetic defects do not introduce new information to the gene code.\n\n Define information.\n \n Actually, if a mutation produces an allele that didn't exist before, the information content of the genome has been increased. And you have to show that in fact all mutations are harmful. To even declare that mutations are \"rarely beneficial\" admits that they can be and shreds your own argument. It seems that even you admit to beneficial mutations that add information to the genome.\n \n Don't forget, define information.\n \nNor do genetic defects represent an incremental step in a mythical leap to some radical new organism. Variety potential, inherent within the dynamic genome assures genetic adaptability but not some quantum leap to some radically new prototype life.\n\n But not all mutations can be called \"genetic defects\" by any stretch of the imagination, and no one proposes that a mutation is a step to a radical new organism. Your whole view is a bit cartoonish. The diversity of any genome is increased by several mechanisms. One of them is mutations. The observed genetic diversity in most organisms would be impossible from only two individuals. And evolution does not propose any quantum leaps to new organisms. Again, that is a cartoonish idea.\n \nNeo-Darwinism ignores this scientific reality and relies on billions of mutations, combined with natural selection, as the source of every kind of life on earth after that first life cell.\n\n And none of that is your cartoonish \"quantum leap\" or \"mythical leap\". The ideas you express are invented by creationists. They invent ridiculous ideas and then argue against them and tell you that they are arguing against evolution.\n \nThe genetic system of each \"kind\" of living creature were sufficiently complex to permit the later development of many variations within it, but the basic \"kind\" was fixed by God in creation.\n\n Nope. Genetics isn't a mystery and even an understanding of the basics reveals that your assertion is just wishful thinking. Besides, you haven't defined \"kind.\"\n \nThe second law of thermodynamics doesn't track with Darwin's speculative progress toward perfection. Given 4.55 billion years, the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics impacts the precise opposite of what evolution requires. Entropy's deterioration and decline is the inevitable consequence in nature. Homo sapiens age, grow weak and die; trees lose their leaves and die; cars rust; buildings crumble; mountains erode.\n\n But since you haven't shown that you know anything about thermodynamics we can just reject your cartoon version out of hand. By the way, seeds grow, tornados form, water freezes. Do you actually know what entropy is?\n \n Also, Darwin said nothing about progress toward perfection, speculative or otherwise.\n \nEvolutionism requires billions of incremental steps to bridge the gaping genetic chasms between organic prototypes: single cell-to-fish-to- amphibian-to-reptile-to-bird and mammal and eventually, to-man. After billions of fossil discoveries, where is the evidence of Darwin's \"...innumerable transitional forms...\"?\n\n There are lots of examples and more are being found. Lots of the gaps have been filled. We have many transistionals between dinosaurs and birds for example, beginning with feathered dinosaurs, birds with teeth and clawed hands and long, boney tails. We have whales with legs. And there are many examples of the evolution of the horse alone.\n \n By the way, there isn't any such thing as \"evolutionism.\" You are just trying to reduce science to the level of creationism. Creationism is based on no evidence, just mythology. Evolution is based on well tested scientific theories.\n \nCertainly not in today's living natural world.\n\n Why would we expect to find transitionals \"living.\"\n \nAs to the miniscule number of fossil forms categorized as \"transitional,\" they represent just another extinct species.\n\n A transitional species. So you are just going to define the evidence out of existence because you don't like it. Besides, there are lots of fossil forms.\n \nSo-called \"intermediates\" carry the label because an evolutionist has declared it, not because of irrefutable proof of genetic linkage as between old bones. Neither homology nor morphology equates genealogy.\n\n So you demand \"proof\" that you know doesn't exist. Too bad that you don't demand similar \"proof\" to support your mythology.\n \nA cell's proteins require \"left-handed,\" amino-acid building blocks. DNA & RNA use only \"right-handed\" building blocks. Natural forms come in a 50-50 mixture. Evolutionism's random chance explains neither the cause nor the discriminating process that mandates selection of left-handed v. right-handed building blocks.\n\n Actually it does. The chirality of all life indicates a common ancestor with those particular chiralities.\n \nA partially evolved body part would render any alleged \"transitional\" severely handicapped. A critter saddled with an appendage half-leg and half-wing couldn't fly or walk efficiently.\n\n Nonsense. Besides the examples of the bat and flying squirrel that you have already been given, there are the birds. Bird's wings weren't legs, they were at one time clawed grasping hands. They were also feathered in some theropod dinosaurs. If they helped the dinosaur to run faster, or to maintain body temperature, or to grasp prey they would have been an advantage. Creationism is so short sighted.\n \nAn incrementally evolving eye would hardly contribute to fitness or survival.\n\n See what I mean about short sighted? Two light sensative spots that would allow an organism to move toward or away from light could be an advantage. The ability to sense the shadow of an approaching preditor would be an advantage.\n \nDr. Michael Behe illustrated the problem by referencing a simple mousetrap with a single missing part---no mouse need fear, the trap couldn't function!\n\n Nope. Debunked.\n \nWith respect to the often-repeated claim that scientists universally believe in evolution, there are today thousands of qualified scientists who are thorough-going Biblical creationists.\n\n The numbers come out that about 95% of all scientists are evolutionists. The numbers are more than 99% of geologists and biologists.\n \nFor example, the Creation Research Society, organized in 1963, has a membership of over 700 such scientists, each with at least an M.S. degree, representing literally every field of modern science, and each believing in the special creation.\n\n The problem is that they were creationists before they were scientists and few of them actually hold degrees in relevant fields. For example, Henry Morris is a Hydraulic engineer. Just look at the number of MD on their list, or biochemists or even kinesiology and veterinary medicine. And please, tell me about the actual science that these men are doing. Please point out some paper in peer reviewed literature that advances their field of science and is based on \"creation science.\" Most \"creation scientists\" stopped doing science when they got their degree.\n \n And then there are such outstanding and famous \"creation scientists\" as Mr. Kent Hovind, Mr. Carl Baugh, or Mr. Don Patton.",

Mutations usually degrade the genome and trigger information loss.\n\n This is false and/or irrelevant. Most mutations are neutral. And beneficial mutations arise with a high enough frequency to explain the evolutionary process. A mutation allowed a certain bacterium to digest nylon.

Another mutation has been found that protects against malaria in humans.\n \n \n \nNeo-Darwinism ignores this scientific reality....\n\n So far, we have been presenting evidence how your misconceptions are wrong -- you are ignoring us, which seems to indicate that you are ignoring scientific reality.\n \n \n \nEntropy's deterioration and decline is the inevitable consequence in nature.\n\n Entropy does not mean deterioration and decline. Look at gallo's thermodynamics test. You do not have to take it -- just look at it.

A flying squirrel seems to do fine with just have a wing.\n \n \n \nAn incrementally evolving eye would hardly contribute to fitness or survival.\n\n This is false. There are plenty of creatures whose eyes are primitive compared to ours, and they do quite well. 50% vision is better than no vision. The ability to tell light from darkness can be a very useful trait.",

   "Actually, Jaaaman got the number correct, but for the wrong reasons. How many base pairs make up the human genome is irrelevant. It is strictly on how many possible chromosomes any two individuals can produce. Here is how it goes.\n \n We know that humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes. We know from Mendel's law of independent assortment that the each pair distributes itself into the gametes independently with no regard as to which parent contributed the chromosome. That means that any individual can produce 2 to the 23rd power different gametes. That number is 8,388,608 possible gametes.\n \n So any two people could produce 8,388,608 X 8,388,608 = 70,368,744,177,664 different genetic combinations.\n \n But that doesn't take into account that possibility that any of the pairs of chromosomes might be identical or that one or more mutations occurred in one of any pair.\n \n But still, even given the diversity that is possible this way, it doesn't account for the diversity that has been observed in individual genes. In humans, there is an average of 14 alleles for every gene. Any two people can carry only 4 different alleles. The only way that the other 10 could arise would be by mutation, which means that they were not harmful - and therefore information was added to the genome.",

   "Thanks, ungerdunn. I thought that was what jaaama may have meant, but I wanted to be sure. Sure, if you count all the different combinations of how an allele of gene A can go along with an allele of gene B I can easily believe that a single pair of ancestors can produce a multitude of \"diverse\" offspring.\n \n But in examining the diversity of the human species, it is not enough to try to explain why some people have blue eyes with brown hair, others blue eyes with blond hair, brown eyes with blond hair, etc. It is how any given gene can have far more different alleles than the original four that presumably existed in the original two ancestors -- at least not without an absurdly high mutation rate!",

   "Here, I'll just attach 3 papers that I had online acess to. The older one from 1981 was not available online, but its abstract was:\n \n \"A simplified math. model of the origin of the left-handed asymmetry of proteins in living matter is presented. The model is based on the hypothesis of F. Vester and T. L. V. Ulbricht (1959) that the chirality of (left-handed) electrons from naturally b-active elements, e.g., 14C, 40K, etc., was the specific source of the asymmetry; it requires for its application data on the interaction of electrons having non-zero chirality with racemic mixts. of amino acids. This interaction is treated theor. in an order-of-magnitude calcn. The anal. yields a very approx. value of the induced steady-state asymmetry in the amino acids at the beginning of protein synthesis and indicates that this asymmetry, though small, may have been sufficient to account for the dominant left-handedness of proteins now obsd.\"\n \n Then notice that the authors on the Biomacromolecule paper are all Japanese.
