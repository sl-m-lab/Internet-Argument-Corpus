I am wondering if anyone knows of any verses in the bible that support this view as I have never seen any myself, and it has never been discussed at my church. Also, I'd like to hear what other religions have to say about gambling. \n \n I personally don't think there is anything wrong with it, although of course it can be done in excess, but then so can anything else.",
