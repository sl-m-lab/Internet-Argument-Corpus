I got to thinking that maybe this part of the tale may be more of a myth along with Adam and Eve, Seth, Cain and incest they had to do if they were trully the only ones on Earth and if you take the Bible literally. Some thoughts? EZ?\nAn ancient history prof of mine once strung it together this way:\n \n The ancient Sumerians (ca 2200 BC) have a tale, The Epic of Gilgamesh, wherein King Gil's best buddy Inki dies. Lonely, Gil goes outside the city and digs down to Hades (or whatever they called it then) to talk to him. Inki describes life in Hades as quite dismal, so Gilgamesh gets the urge to live forever. He searches far and wide, and gets wind of a hermit living in the mountains (now in western Iran). He finds the hermit, and the hermit tells the story: The gods became angry with mankind, and decided to send a great flood. One of the gods took pity on the hermit, Utnapishtim (means \"the man who lives forever\" in the Sumerian language) and told him to build a boat to ride out the flood. Ut did so, and floated for 40 days before the water went down and stranded him on the highest peak of the mountain range (whose name I forget). The first thing he did was sacrifice one of the goats he had brought along. In those days the gods actually ate the sacrifices, and did not have the foresight to see what would happen if they wiped out their worshippers - after 40 days, they were hungry and eagerly came trooping down to share the goat. The party was in full swing when one of the gods noticed Ut, and asked \"Hey! What's HE doing here?\" After much discussion, the gods compromised: for being a good man, Utnapishtim would be given the gift of eternal life in the form of the Tree Of Life - but, so word would not get out about their indiscretion, Utnapishtim would have to spend eternity in his little valley. Gilgamesh talked Utnapishtim out of the tree, and was carrying the tree home with him. He stopped to drink from a well, a snake jumped out and startled him into dropping the tree, the snake grabbed the tree and disappeared back into the well. That is why, to this very day, men are mortal and snakes live forever - you can tell by the way they leave their skins lying around each spring when they are reborn.\n \n The Babylonians (ca 1800 BC) borrowed the flood story, changed the name of the hermit to Ziusudra (\"the man who lives forever\" in Babylonian), but kept the same mountain for the scene.\n \n The name Noah doesn't mean anything in Hebrew, and there was no connection until about 1928 (I think) when archeologists discovered a tribe called the Hurrians who had moved into the Middle East from the direction of Armenia. They borrowed the story, changed the hermit's name to Noah (\"the man who lives forever\" in Hurrian), and changed the name of the mountain to Ararat, which is the highest one they knew of.\n \n When the Hebrews moved into the area a couple of centuries later, after 40 years on the road from Egypt, they apparently adopted the story whole.\n \n Personally, I'm not sure I buy all of this, but my history prof was a very good storyteller. I was sorry I was taking his class for credit, because it would have been much more enjoyable just to sit back and listen to him without the bother of taking notes.",
