   "These videos are hilarious by the way.\n \n \"Why does WellPoint deny care to people who cared their premiums\"...with a title of \"medicare for all\". Of course Medicare also denies people their care who have paid taxes and qualify for Medicare. \n \n These arguments are hilarious as well. It basically comes down to the fact that they don't like people making a lot of money...they are soo greedy with their extremely low profit margin (lowest in the insurance industry). This reminds me of those greedy grocery store owners! How dare they deny something that is required for life based upon the ability to pay. I say if you need it to live it should be free and paid for by those who are rich. Wait, whats that? Having a few rich pay for everyone else gives the rich more power? Well that won't work emoticon_frazzled",
