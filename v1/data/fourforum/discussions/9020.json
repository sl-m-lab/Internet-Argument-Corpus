   "Discussing the recent resignation of former Rep. Mark Foley (R-FL) with host Chris Wallace on the October 1 edition of Fox Broadcasting Co.'s Fox News Sunday, Fox News political analyst and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) claimed that House Republicans would have \"been accused of gay bashing\" if they had \"overly aggressively reacted\" to Foley's allegedly inappropriate email communications with a 16-year-old male congressional page when House Republicans reportedly first learned of Foley's actions in late 2005. As Media Matters for America has noted, the House Republican leadership -- including House Majority Leader John Boehner (OH), National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Reynolds (NY), and a senior aide to House Speaker Dennis Hastert (IL) -- has reportedly known for months about Foley's emails. Wallace then asked: \"How would it have been gay bashing?\" Gingrich replied: \"Because it was a male-male relationship,\" adding that \"there was no proof\" that Foley was a \"predatory person.\"\n http://mediamatters.org/items/200610010003",

The lie here isn't that the GOP thought they might be accused of gay bashing, the lie is that they would care.

They count on people knowing that they're anti-gay to gather support from the religious right. They wouldn't fear being caught gay-bashing, they'd take out campaign ads announcing the fact.

   "Along with saying Foley was a democrat when the story broke, it wouldn't amaze me if this was yet more spin, not only trying to draw the attention away from a Foley sleeping with minors and breaking the law he actually himself made, but to also imply that they thought the democrats would take his side.\n \n That said though I did see an interesting thing elsewhere..\n \n \nThe problem here, of course, (as I mentioned last week) is that liberals don't equate homosexuality with pedophilia because most of the gays on our side of the spectrum tend to be well-integrated and comfortable with themselves. They're out, they're self-aware, and they've been allowed the chance to grow into their own adult sexuality. They're grownups, with normal lives and normal relationships. Since these are the gays we know, we're quite clear that gay men aren't any more likely to be child molesters than straight men are. When we talk about gay issues, these are the people we've got in mind. \n \n But, as we're learning this week, when conservatives say that gays are pedophiles, they may also be accurately reporting what they see on their own side. As I've discussed here before, a core reason people become conservative because they're afraid of losing control. (Words like \"repressed\" and \"tightly wound\" may apply here.) Psychologists who work with pedophiles -- both hetero and homo -- say that virtually all of them suffered some major innocence-shattering life trauma when they were at a similar age as their victims. Their psychosexual development stopped right there, and never went any further. Thus, in a real sense, pedophiles are sexually still children themselves, and thus simply seeking out their developmental peers \n ... \n \n \n The upshot here is that, if you're a Republican, it seems quite possible that an unusual number of the gays you know really are pretty sick and twisted characters who prey on boys. Evidently, there's a nonstop parade of these guys in God's Own Party: in fact, what we're seeing this week is that they're so pervasive that Sidney Blumenthal recently called the GOP the \"largest walk-in closet in Washington.\" \n \n Which means that we may need to realize that when our conservative friends start going on about those gay child sex perverts, they're just calling it exactly as they see it. And we, in response, think of the well-adjusted, healthy gay folk we know, and wonder what in the hell they're talking about. It may be time for both sides to consider the possibility that, just maybe, we are both telling the truth. Or, at least, two different truths about the same issue. \n \n No idea who 'Sara Robinson' is who wrote it originally, but hey.",

One which he will be investigated for. He is making no excuses (beyond possibly alcoholism) for his actions. He resigned, and is not seeking re-election.\n I'm not sure where the \"debate\" would be on that issue.

The implications for the Republican members who saw the smoke and didn't investigate the fire. THAT is the issue of disagreement.\n And THAT is why there is focus there.\n \n Another part of this that you are demonstrating your PURE partisanship on, beyond just the baseless accusations that Democrats knew about Foley earlier and purposely did nothing until later for political reasons, is that it IS NOT JUST DEMOCRATS who are making the waves...\n \n \nWhile 52 percent of Americans believe Hastert was aware of Foley's actions and tried to cover them up, it's part of a larger loss of faith in Republican leadership, thanks mostly to the war in Iraq. For instance, for the first time in the NEWSWEEK poll, a majority of Americans now believe the Bush administration knowingly misled the American people in building its case for war against Saddam Hussein: 58 percent vs. 36 percent who believe it didn't. \n\n http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15167150/site/newsweek/page/2/\n \n So continue complaining about \"democrats\" all you want.\n Continue to cry that they are the bad guy who are improperly focusing on the Republicans.\n A majority of the country are asking these questions, and while I understand that it's a typical Republican ploy to blame the democrats, it doesn't seem to be working at the moment...\n \n you might want to try something new...",

(Gingrich already pointed out that the emails they knew of were innocuous.) If I found out someone I knew, as an adult, were carrying on email correspondence with someone who had worked under them and had left, and that someone happened to have been under 18, I wouldn't think anything of it. Would you automatically assume something like that was sexual? Sure, in this case it turned out to be, but how many times do people carry on email exchanges like that? It just doesn't seem to be something that would be THAT out of the ordinary, particularly since pages sometimes are under a sort of 'mentor' relationship with public officials. If you want to call that naive of me, go ahead, but I just tend to not assume things are sexual on the front end. And I suspect Hastert did the same thing. (Of course in THIS case, he turned out to be wrong in doing so, but it's at least understandable to me that he would make an error like that.)",

   "So you're saying Hastert knew all along that Foley was out to have sex with underage kids.\n\n It's funny how the sentences you post that start with \"So you're saying...\" or \"Are you saying that...\" typically have something follow WHICH IS NOT my position...\n \n No. I'm not saying that.\n \n \n \nIt just doesn't make enough sense that Hastert would put not only his career at risk, but risk losing a thin majority of congress as well.\n\n Where's the \"risk\"?\n He's got people like you insisting that this shouldn't reflect badly on the other Republicans. People like you shelling out all sorts of excuses and ignoring the issue of how NUMEROUS people were warned of impropriety on NUMEROUS occasions before this actually hit.\n \n Here's a question for YOU Jyoshu.\n Do you think it's rational for any republican congressperson to lose an election based on what happened in all of this?\n \n \n \nI think this is a case where Hastert and others gave Foley the benefit of the doubt not because they were trying to cover up something they knew about, but because they didn't really put two and two together that this was a sexual thing.\n\n And therein lies the rub...\n The Republican party, which prides itself on the campaign slogans of \"family values\" and \"protecting America\", because the democrats can't be trusted with it, can't \"put two and two together\" (as you put it) to realize the risk in their own midst. Sometimes, reported by THEIR OWN PEOPLE...\n \n And the next question is obvious Jyoshu.\n If they truly did not think it was a sexual thing, then WHY THE WARNING???\n \n \n \nIf I found out someone I knew, as an adult, were carrying on email correspondence with someone who had worked under them and had left, and that someone happened to have been under 18, I wouldn't think anything of it. Would you automatically assume something like that was sexual? Sure, in this case it turned out to be, but how many times do people carry on email exchanges like that? It just doesn't seem to be something that would be THAT out of the ordinary, particularly since pages sometimes are under a sort of 'mentor' relationship with public officials.\n\n Again, there are elements of the case which you repeatedly try to rewrite. Trying to ignore the facts of the case...\n \n These people weren't just \"told\" that Foley was just \"e-mailing\" pages.\n They were \"alerted\" about \"questionable\" and \"inappropriate\" e-mails.\n Not just correspondence, but words that CLEARLY denote a need for concern.\n \n And the question YOU need to answer is that if they TRULY THOUGHT this was all \"innocent\", then WHY THE WARNING???\n WHY did they go to Foley and tell him to \"stand down\"? (HASTERT's words...)\n \n That's a question you need to address Jyoshu...",

   "Here's a question for YOU Jyoshu.\n Do you think it's rational for any republican congressperson to lose an election based on what happened in all of this?\n\n \n The only one that should lose an election over this should be Foley.\n \n \nThese people weren't just \"told\" that Foley was just \"e-mailing\" pages.\n They were \"alerted\" about \"questionable\" and \"inappropriate\" e-mails.\n Not just correspondence, but words that CLEARLY denote a need for concern.\n\n \n Oh, so in your mind \"questionable\" and \"inappropriate\" automatically means sexual (hint, hint, nudge, nudge ...) Sorry Foundit, but people don't typically assume someone is trying to have sex with underage kids. Particularly when that someone goes to great pains to hide it and make excuses. I'm sure I could name any number of people--friends and family--that you know well, and if I told you they were trying to do that, you probably wouldn't believe me. And if you asked them about it, they'd deny it, and you' believe it. \"questionable\" and \"innappropriate\" don't always equate to sexual-red-flag, Foundit. You might even tell that friend that he needs to stop emailing his teenage buddy because people just might get the wrong idea. Is that starting to sink in??\n \n \nAnd the question YOU need to answer is that if they TRULY THOUGHT this was all \"innocent\", then WHY THE WARNING???\n WHY did they go to Foley and tell him to \"stand down\"? (HASTERT's words...)\n \n That's a question you need to address Jyoshu...\n\n \n It's simple--they didn't think the emails were sexual and were telling him to stop because it was making people suspicious. Considering they've already said the emails they saw were innocuous, I see no reason not to believe that. They probably thought people were getting the wrong idea.",

   "The only one that should lose an election over this should be Foley.\n\n And there you have it.\n \n You ask why he would \"risk\" congressional seats and his position based on these actions...\n ... but then you demonstrate that for people who think like you, there is NO RISK.\n \n You have pretty much answered your own question...\n \n \n \nOh, so in your mind \"questionable\" and \"inappropriate\" automatically means sexual (hint, hint, nudge, nudge ...)\n\n No. In my mind, they definitely DO NOT mean innocent. Period.\n Get that?\n If somebody says \"inappropriate\" to you, does that automatically mean \"innocent\"? <end sarcasm<\n \n What they COULD mean includes the possibility of \"sexual\".\n What they DO NOT mean is \"innocent\". What they DO NOT mean is \"dismissable\".\n What they DO NOT mean, when reported from a credible source, is \"no need to investigate\"...\n (and before you run off with your next strawman, I'm talking about if \"inappropriate\" is an accurate portrayal of the situation.)\n \n \n \nSorry Foundit, but people don't typically assume someone is trying to have sex with underage kids.\n\n Sigh. And thus jyoshu runs firmly on with his strawman argument...\n Not what I'm saying...\n \n \n \nI'm sure I could name any number of people--friends and family--that you know well, and if I told you they were trying to do that, you probably wouldn't believe me.\n\n :xbanghead \n If it warranted enough credibility to bring forth a warning to Foley, then it warrants enough credibility to demonstrate that YOU BELIEVE there is something there.\n \n \n \nAnd if you asked them about it, they'd deny it, and you' believe it.\n\n That's only because I put more stock in them than you...\n And because of that, I wouldn't even have asked them in the first place if you were my only source.\n \n The republicans had NUMEROUS warnings from NUMEROUS sources.\n \n But regardless, if I \"believed it\", I wouldn't follow it up with a warning to stop behavior that is \"innocent\", as you claim....\n \n \n \nYou might even tell that friend that he needs to stop emailing his teenage buddy because people just might get the wrong idea. Is that starting to sink in??\n\n If it's completely innocent, then there is no reason for the warning.\n I don't warn people that others might get the \"wrong idea\". I don't govern my life, nor do I advise others to limit their lives in fear of inaccurate perceptions.\n \n And on this issue of a hypothetical \"innocent\" Republican office-holder, any \"accusations\" could be firmly met with the strongest of positions. The truth.\n The \"victim\" could step forward and explicitly say \"This is bull. We're just friends. He asked me how I enjoyed being a page. Not how big my cup size was.\"\n How stupid does it look when you try to accuse somebody of something and you HAVE NO VICTIM???\n The only \"risk\" there is that you're going to turn the opponent's slur-fest into a stepping stone for proving him an idiot and a liar.\n \n \n \nIt's simple--they didn't think the emails were sexual and were telling him to stop because it was making people suspicious. Considering they've already said the emails they saw were innocuous, I see no reason not to believe that. They probably thought people were getting the wrong idea.\n\n With NO investigation??? NO further inquiry?\n I'm sorry, but no. That was GROSSLY negligent of them.\n They should have at least asked to read the e-mails and correspondence. Do what the news people and police / FBI would do and ask the people he was corresponding with.\n If it brings enough concern to ask the question of somebody you supposedly \"trust\", then it's obvious that you DO NOT trust him.\n \n And on another level, how many people who do this sort of XXXX would just admit to another friend, \"Yeah. I do that. It's sexual in nature.\"...\n The expected response, guilty or innocent, is a denial.\n Logically, if the outcome is the same, guilty or innocent, then you think of another way to test the situation.\n \n ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n \n And for the record, if you think I'm trying to say that Hastert \"covered up\" Foley's actions with a charade, that's not what I'm saying...",
