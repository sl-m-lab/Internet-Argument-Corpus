But until then, why not let them pursue legal enrichment? Why not make reasonable demands, instead of following the course of action we're on now?\n\n \n The problem is pretty simple. The \"inspections\" we want have nothing to do with Iranian nuclear activities. It is just like the BS we were pulling with Iraq. We were demanding that we be able to \"inspect\" everything up to and including Saddams private living quarters. I doubt the guy was going to have an anthrax lab in his closet. We were demanding records from Iraqi companies that had nothing at all, and could not possibly have anything at all, to do with WMDs, and turning those records over to competitors. We were demanding not only physical assets to, but complete records from military facilities that we had no reason to suspect. We basically turned the whole WMD inspection program into an absolute farce and used it as a massive spy program. \n \n Now, we are trying to do the same with the nuclear inspections in Iran. If we were just inspecting nuclear facilities, there would probably be no problem. That is not what we want, though. What we want is to use their nuclear program as an excuse to crack open the entire country and the Iranians object. The last 2 places we wanted to \"inspect\" were the facility where Iran makes their newest long range missile and their new rocket torpedos. Not only did the US IAEA inspectors demand access for inspections, despite the fact that we have already publicly stated that the missile is not nuclear capable, they wanted full design and construction details on both projects. \n \n The same thing that happened in Iraq has happened here. We subverted the inspection program and are trying to use it for our own end as opposed to using it to actually inspect for WMDS or nuclear weapons. Like Iraq, the Iranians have balked at the idea of laying their entire nation bare. Now we are screaming \"non compliance\" and trying to pressure Iran into giving us unfettered access to their nation. Predictably, their answer remains NO.",
