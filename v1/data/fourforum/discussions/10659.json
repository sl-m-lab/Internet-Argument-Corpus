Is there not a consensus among Christians concerning creationism? Does that make it a fact?\n\n \n My car runs on gasoline. If I deny evolution, I must deny that my car runs on gasoline. It doesn't get stronger then that. The consensus is actually irrelevant. The proof is in the tangibles of supporting sciences. Most creationists just ignore this and run away. Arch pretends that he can accept geology and its relation to fossil fuels but reject evolution even though the same sciences that bring him fossil fuels support evolution. It's a life of hypocrisy. Numbers are really quite irrelevant whether it is true or not. What matters is that there is proof. The bandwagon has rarely been a good measure of validity. \n \n \n3. Pay attention boy. I have not attacked evolution. Simply re-applied the reason and source of it. In reality, explained the lack of teleology.\n\n \n Not at all. You completely ignored the central issue of this thread and instead moved it to a discussion about purely evolution. Exactly what creationists always do. This is about if one theory is false does it make another true? Essentially this is nothing more then a discussion about false dichotomies. What you have done is completely ignored this and moved towards an argument of why evolution isn't true. It doesn't matter if evolution is true. It does not make the competing idea correct merely in its invalidity. The competing idea must be validated on its own merits, not because evolution is false. Hence why I talked about the innocences of suspect A automatically making suspect B guilty where there were multiple suspects. I am not stupid and I know how creationists operate. You did exactly what they would do.\n \n \n3b. An intelligent creationist would open your eyes to another possibility. Your refusal to see it would be on you.\n\n \n Not at all. The only intelligent creationists I know of are those who deliberately lie to enrich themselves. Austin probably knew that the samples he took of the Grand Canyon were not cogenetic. Did he mention this? No. But his works sold and he got rich. I have not met or heard of a intelligent creationist who believed because he thought it was true aside from Dr. Kent, but he's not exactly a typical creationist nor does he use the arguments of literal creationism. He believes because the Bible says so, entirely on faith. And he does not argue that evolution is false, therefore making Creationism true. \n \n \n4. Excellent reasons for evolution. Now, explain the teleology behind evolution on it's own.\n\n \n How is it any different then the teleology behind the basic scientific method?",

   "Even though, evolution is probably simply a tool implemented by God, much of it is simply a matter of consensus concerning vague comparisons of bones declared to be of different ages by people with similar agendas.\n\n \n emoticon_wow Talk about loaded and inaccurate statements! First of all, we have the loaded phrase: \"people with similar agendas\". Well, we all know that \"people with agendas\" are devious, mendacious, shifty, untrustworthy, and shouldn't be allowed near women, children or horses. So this statement comes prejudicially loaded against scientists, because they are dismissed from the outset as \"people with agendas\".\n \n Secondly, there is the throw-away phrase: \"vague comparisons\". My friends, paleontologists and molecular geneticists do not make \"vague comparisons\" of the materials they study. They actually make highly detailed comparisons. Paleontologists will typically compare tens, hundreds or even thousands of characteristics between fossils. Molecular geneticists compare not merely the DNA sequences of individual genes, but these days entire genomes. \n \n \"Vague comparisons\"? That is, as we say in the debating trade, \"deliberately disingenuous\".\n \n Third, what image does the phrase \"bones declared to be of different ages\" supposed to raise? Why, it's a clear implication that scientists make unjustifiable and arbitrary assumptions, convenient for their supposed agendas, about the relative age of their fossils, rather than trying carefully to date them, the strata they reside in, and those on both sides. There are many independent ways of dating, and they have been calibrated against each other in zones of overlap to provide objective assessments of their reliability. There are numerous controls, and detailed ways of identifying and handling artifactual results.\n \n Scientists don't just \"declare\" bones to be \"of different ages\" -- they work hard to establish the actual age.\n \n \nNow, deny that without thought. Does that make you a zealot? \n Or is your proof more concrete than speculation and concensus?\n\n \n I think that with only a little bit of thought, your objections can be dismissed as unworthy, anti-scientific dissembling that doesn't take scientific reality into account -- probably in order to advance a religious agenda! :)",
