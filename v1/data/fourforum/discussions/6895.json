   "Has anyone seen The Defender? It's an action movie with Dolph Lundgren. But it has a good political plot. It's really smart--for a Dolph Lundgren film. The story is mainly about a national security team that has to protect the secretary of defense while she has a secret meeting with a terrorist. Plus, the fight scenes are really intense, too. People getting blown up left and right.",
