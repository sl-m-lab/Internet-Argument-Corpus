   "Certainly it is quite natural for Europeans to take intense interest in what is happening in Turkey now if it's common knowledge that the country may become a new EU member soon. And it is no wonder that there are some things that XXXX me greatly. See for yourself! Turkish special services declare cyber war on separatists and fundamentalists. Nevertheless they continue to give shelter to the same Chechen terrorists. Take, for example, one of their leaders Mr. Udugov who lives in security in Turkey and coordinates illegal activity of his Chechen comrades-in-arms. So it seems to me Turkish cyber war only puts up a smoke-screen. And in reality Turkey continues to pose a threat for EU security, especially if we take into account constant escalating the threat of terrorist acts in Europe now.",
