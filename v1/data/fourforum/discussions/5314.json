   "No doubt we will be again told that oil cost is the result of \"inflation.\"\n =======================\n \n Reuters ^ | May 19, 2005: 3:56 PM EDT | staff\n \n NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices continued recent heavy losses Thursday as dealers focused on a glut of U.S. stockpiles, which have grown to the highest in six years. Weakness was curtailed, however, after OPEC's president said the cartel could rein in output if inventories rose too fast and after an oil workers' strike forced shut several refineries in France. U.S. light crude for June delivery ended down 33 cents to $46.92 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after falling as low as $46.80, its lowest since mid February.

   "All the geniuses here will still be opining that oil prices are the result of inflation when it falls below $30 a barrel. \n \n The truth is that no one really knows what the price of oil should be because it isn't truly market based as we normally experience here in the U.S. OPEC is a price fixing cartel. For all we know it might be $10 a barrel if the market actually determined the price. In the absence of any way to know that we can safely assume that supply and demand will always determine the price. \n \n I've posted several articles from business sources that all say the same thing. Today the price of oil dropped still further and it had absolutely nothing to do with \"inflation.\"\n ========================================\n Oil Prices Slip on Mixed OPEC Signals\n May 20, 2005 2:41 PM EDT\n \n VIENNA, Austria - Crude oil futures prices slipped Friday amid conflicting signals from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and a relatively upbeat assessment of energy prices from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.\n \n Light, sweet crude for June delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 12 cents to settle at $46.80 a barrel. The contract expired Friday.\n \n Heating oil and unleaded gas prices each rose by more than a cent to $1.3673 a gallon and $1.4191 a gallon, respectively.\n \n On London's International Petroleum Exchange, Brent crude for July rose 15 cents to $48.03.\n \n Greenspan said that oil and gas prices have calmed a bit recently, in his speech to the Economic Club of New York on Friday. Private inventories of crude oil in the United States have climbed to their highest level in three years, helping to curb the recent \"price frenzy,\" he said.\n \n Earlier this week, Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi said his country - the group's main producer - was \"ready to raise output as the market dictates.\" On Wednesday, OPEC president Sheik Ahmed Fahd Al Ahmed Al Sabah, who is also Kuwait's oil minister, said the group could cut its output ceiling by 1 million barrels a day if global oil inventories pile up too quickly.\n \n But Al Sabah appeared to reverse himself Thursday, telling Dow Jones Newswires: \"We believe we should sustain production.\"\n \n The comments appeared to reflect the push-pull of OPEC's twin concerns - maintaining stability without seeing the floor drop out of oil markets.\n \n OPEC traditionally produces more than the group's official quota, now at 27.5 million barrels a day. PVM Oil Associates in Vienna said that - without Iraq, which is exempt from ceilings while it rebuilds - over-quota output from OPEC's 10 other members was at just over 700,000 barrels in May, or about 300,000 barrels less than Al Sabah has estimated.\n \n Crude futures are more than $10 below April's all-time high of $58.28. OPEC is to meet June 15 in Vienna to plan strategy for the second half of the year.\n \n Analyst Jonathan Copus of Investec Securities in London said OPEC's anxieties are being fed by \"a six-year high in (U.S.) inventories, prices pulling back a bit and various conflicting pieces of information about the possibility of demand erosion.\"\n \n The U.S. Department of Energy revealed a build of 334 million barrels in the previous week, the 13th increase in the past 14 weeks. Inventories are up 34 million barrels from a year ago, the highest since May 1999.\n \n However, oil editorial manager Ng Weng Hoong at Energyasia.com said the inventory figures are not as bearish as they seem.\n \n The United States lacks sufficient refineries to process the crude oil, and global demand is growing faster than the stock builds, Ng said. He added that traders should also focus on China and India, whose appetites for crude oil are still increasing.\n \n The Energy Department said Thursday that U.S. refiners ran at 94.0 percent capacity, up from 91.8 percent a week ago. With refiners approaching peak capacity, analysts worry that the facilities may not be able to cope when demand, especially for gasoline, rises in summer.\n \n Analysts also pointed to work unrest, now in its fifth day, that has shut or crippled five of Total SA's six refineries in France.\n \n http://start.earthlink.net/article/bus?guid=20050520/428d60c0_3421_1334520050520-516968131",

A copy of the speech was distributed in Washington.\n \n \"Today, despite its recent surge, the average price of crude oil in real terms is still only three-quarters of the price peak of February 1981,\" the Fed chief said.\n \n In the wake of sharply higher prices, said Greenspan, the energy intensity of the US economy has been reduced about half since the early 1970s. Much of that displacement was achieved by 1985. Progress in reducing energy intensity has continued since then.\n \n Meanwhile, he said that \"Obviously, the risk of more-serious negative consequences would intensify if oil prices were to move materially higher.\"\n \n But he also said that it should be market forces that helps stabilize prices.

   "Which clearly disproves this \"inflation\" crapola posted here. Note the date of the highest inflation adjusted price of oil. The Euro didn't even exist then. Bush wasn't in office. We weren't in Iraq and the \"fascists\" had yet taken over the U.S. as per our resident economic dunce, Daewoo.\n ==================================\n Inflation Adjusted Oil Price Chart\n \n Updated- March 4, 2005\n \n by Tim McMahon\n \n http://inflationdata.com/inflation/images/charts/Oil_inflation_20050404.gif\n \n The above chart has changed from our previous chart. We have switched to monthly data from average annual data so you will get a bit more detail. In some ways I prefer the average because the monthly exaggerates the spikes.\n \n Just because the price for one month hits extreme values doesn't really affect the consumer very much. After all how much oil does someone buy in a single month? The average is a more accurate picture of actual expenses the consumer would see during the year but this chart does show the smaller bumps so some people prefer it.\n \n As you can see from 1946 until the early 1970's the nominal price of oil remained basically flat but the inflation adjusted price of Oil actually declined slightly.\n \n The tremendous spike in the 1970's resulted from the Arab Oil embargo and OPEC taking control of Oil prices. Prior to that the US government had forced US producers to produce oil at controlled prices so U.S. production had declined and more and more oil had come from overseas. This is what eventually resulted in OPEC gaining enough power over our supply to allow the embargo to have any teeth.\n \n As the oil price adjusted to true market pricing it spiked up and has been floating freely ever since.\n \n Recently, forces have converged to create a similar situation. But this time it is mainly a transportation problem. \n \n Remember the Exxon Valdez the ship that crashed off the coast of Alaska and spilled millions of barrels of oil all over the coast? Well believe it or not, that was the beginning of our current problem. Because of that accident and a couple of others like it, governments around the world began outlawing single hulled tankers.\n \n This created a shortage of double hulled tankers. And double hulled tankers are very expensive to build and weren't very profitable with oil at $20/ barrel. So there was no rush to build them (plus they aren't built in a day even if there was a rush!)\n \n In addition to not enough tankers, there aren't enough pipelines either. Who wants a pipeline in their backyard?\n \n So we are caught in a crunch between inadequate transportation and an increase in demand for oil. Because the US and China are both coming out of a recession both countries are demanding vast increases in oil. Fortunately, this winter has proven relatively mild on the east coast reducing the demand for oil and relieving the crunch somewhat.\n \n Tim McMahon is the editor of Financial Trend Forecaster in addition to the editor of InflationData.com \"The Place in Cyberspace for inflation data\" and the editor of Your Family Finances.

Instead, they ended up producing another 300,000 BPD, and it ws nto the light sweet that Saudi is so famous for, it was basically barrels of tar. Additionally, all saudi fields are now using hot water injection, which is not something you do for fun (becuase it is expensive) nor is it something that fresh, hiugh production fields generally require.\n \n Besides lying about production capability, I think they have been lying about reserves for years. When Opec changed the way they figured pumping quotas, relatign them to reserves, the amount of reserves in the ME nearly tripled in the next few years, despite the fact that Kuwait and Saudi arabia were already fully explored, including test wells, and the geogrophy of the region was fully mapped. The only resaonable explanation for this is that they lied about their reserves in order to increase their pumping quota. Even USGS does not independantly calculate the reserves for these coutnries, nor are they privy to the way these reserves are calcualted (took nearly 2 weeks to find that out, had to send a letter).",

While your sources are indisputable, their intent and your comprehension of composition are another matter. While your patriotic enthusiasm is certainly unquestioned, it, with a lack of finance/economic fundamentals, seemingly restricts your ability to rationally discuss matters that reflect poorly on the US and its future.\n\n \n Well, I thank you for relating your pedigree in business background. It is most impressive. So you are fully qualified to opine and express a point of view contrary to mine. But let's look at the facts.\n \n You can't argue with the historical price of crude oil that I posted above. As you can see, there is little or no coorelation with \"inflation.\" (See below for further discussion) I said from the gitgo that the price of crude was largely a product of supply and demand. That is the same force that forced the price of scrap metal up to historic heights last year and who has more scrap metal than does the U.S.? Yet, we know that our inflation rate has been at extremely low levels for many years now. There are other reasons that the price of crude is or was so high in absolute terms (not in relative terms). They have to do with the \"terrorism premium\" and/or other political instability in the middle east. And certainly it is demonstrably true that the demand by China and India will add to the already high demand from the U.S. imported oil. And certainly, we can't help ourselves by failing to build new gasoline refineries (although that doesn't account for the price of crude.) I mention this because the American motorist doesn't give a damn about the price of crude; only that the price of a gallon of gasoline is cheap enough to afford to buy.\n \n Now as to this \"inflation\" argument: No one can possibly argue that our true consumer inflation rate has been significant. Some prices are up; some are down but on balance the overall basket of consumer goods has increased only slightly. If one has purchased a vehicle recently (as I have) the bargains are almost too good to be true. In fact the new F-150 I recently purchased was even less given its features that weren't even offered in the new F-150 I bought in 1993. The prices of consumer goods is way down; especially in consumer electronics, etc.\n \n The argument put forth by Daewoo has to do with \"monetary inflation\" as I recall. I went to Google today to see if I could even find such a term as a concept, but I can guess. The argument would be that as the the Euro has appreciated in value compared to the dollar that this amounts to \"inflation\" as the dollar purchases less euros. And then we got bogged down in this silly argument about a \"basket of currencies\" that went off into nowwhereland and was a diversion altogether as it was largely irrelevant. I wish I hadn't brought it up because it just confused the issue.\n \n Let's look at this a little closer. If it were true that \"inflation\" of the U.S. dollar was significant, it would follow that the Chinese would be particularly interested in unpegging their currency (the Yuan) to the dollar. Who wants to swap finished goods for a depreciating currency? Has anyone ever heard the Saudis complaining about the value of the dollar? I haven't. It is true that the Europeans received a benefit from an appreciating Euro as their Euros will purchase more dollars which will be used to buy oil since oil is denominated in dollars. That much is true. But it is not true to extrapolate from that benefit that \"inflation\" or \"dollar inflation\" (or whatever one chooses to call it) is the reason for the price of oil going up (it is now coming down BTW). What is true beyond all dispute is that an expanding economy in the U.S, China, India and elsewhere with a growing appetite for crude oil will rachet up the price of oil. It is a natural result of economics and we don't need to spin elaborate and silly arguments about \"inflation\" driving the price of crude.\n \n And finally, I am reminded of the advice given to me many years ago by this auctioneer. He said that the value of something was only what someone else was willing to pay for it. And thus it is true for crude oil. If the price of oil gets too high we will replace it much like we replaced whale oil in the 1800s. This is one of the reasons the Saudis in particular are so very much interested in seeing that the price of crude doesn't get too high or they will be digging their own economic graves. Sooner or later we will find a substitute or greatly reduce its consumption. That will surely impact the price of crude as it does everything. The bottom line is this. The law of supply and demand will never be repealed; not now, not ever.",

It is a natural result of economics and we don't need to spin elaborate and silly arguments about \"inflation\" driving the price of crude.\n \n\n \n I suggest you look at the currencies and issuing countries themselves. You'll better understand what makes them tick and how they function as a medium of exchange. I would not want to unpeg the Yuan because it will display strength and add even more USD to Chinese reserves as prices to US and other consumers increase on a proportionate basis. As the USD is encumbered by substantial public debt service, a declining industrial sector, abnormal deficits and out-of-proportion military expenses, it prints more money to perpetuate and increase those problems, constantly diluting USD value. The USD has been in decline for 30-years. Only in the past three years has that decline accelerated to a point of alarm. The Euro has negligible debt and a mix of economies behind it, not just one, that equal the US GDP. \n \n Oil is no longer dominated by USD other than in Canada, Mexico, the US, UK, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq and some smaller nations. The rest of Europe other than the UK, including Russia, Iran and Venezuela now use the Euro for crude oil exchanges. The Euro for oil was one of the primary reasons Saddam was invaded and many private analysts feel US political pressure regarding USD and Brent oil is the real reason the UK has not joined in Euro participation. If you understand the reasoning behind US necessity for as much oil trade as possible to continue in USD, you'll better understand how that relates to US need for other countries to purchase US treasury issues to obtain USD using their national currencies. \n \n As to US economic growth, I suggest you take the US GDP, +/-$11-trillion, subtract this year's deficit, Afghanistan/Iraq (supplementary, non-budget) and SS 'surplus' to see where that leaves you when your government is claiming a 4% growth rate. The only reason the government is using tariffs, supporting inefficient business sectors and other attempts to reduce the payment imbalance is a grasp to shave the trade imbalance because it has a direct impact on GDP calculation, the magic (but cooked) number on which politicians and the general public base consumer confidence. \n \n Your level of patriotism and brand loyalty regarding facts is approaching blindness, and that's always needed to keep the masses comfortable, but other than driving consumer confidence, emotion has no place in rational discussion of finance or economics. Look not at just published numbers, every form of business, media and government has a big axe to grind, look at underlying factors, actual composition and determine where favorable adjustments and omissions are taking place to achieve favorable publicity. No different than buying a stock or bond. Money has no friends or emotion.",

   "Oil is no longer dominated by USD other than in Canada, Mexico, the US, UK, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq and some smaller nations. The rest of Europe other than the UK, including Russia, Iran and Venezuela now use the Euro for crude oil exchanges. The Euro for oil was one of the primary reasons Saddam was invaded and many private analysts feel US political pressure regarding USD and Brent oil is the real reason the UK has not joined in Euro participation. If you understand the reasoning behind US necessity for as much oil trade as possible to continue in USD, you'll better understand how that relates to US need for other countries to purchase US treasury issues to obtain USD using their national currencies. \n\n \n I think it is important for people to note why the decline of the dominance of the petro dollar is so important, and its replacement by the petro euro is such a problem for the US. As long a the petro dollar reigns supreme, the US governemtn can essentially export currency as a commodity since the demand for dollars is ensured due to the fact that other nations need the currency to buy their oil. With the petro dollar dominant, the US government has essentially been able to run a profitable enterprise essentially printing money. As more naitons go to a Euro based oil purchasing model, this leaves trillions of US dollars that nobody particularly wants floating on the open market.

   "Now as to this \"inflation\" argument: No one can possibly argue that our true consumer inflation rate has been significant. Some prices are up; some are down but on balance the overall basket of consumer goods has increased only slightly. If one has purchased a vehicle recently (as I have) the bargains are almost too good to be true. In fact the new F-150 I recently purchased was even less given its features that weren't even offered in the new F-150 I bought in 1993. The prices of consumer goods is way down; especially in consumer electronics, etc.\n\n \n This is consumer level inflation. Currently, we are just seeing the tip of the iceberg when it comes to consumer level inflation. Consumer level inflation is always followed by increased energy costs and dollar decliune. With our current public an private ebt levels, the question is....massive inflation, or Hyperinflation?\n \n \nThe argument put forth by Daewoo has to do with \"monetary inflation\" as I recall. I went to Google today to see if I could even find such a term as a concept, but I can guess. The argument would be that as the the Euro has appreciated in value compared to the dollar that this amounts to \"inflation\" as the dollar purchases less euros. And then we got bogged down in this silly argument about a \"basket of currencies\" that went off into nowwhereland and was a diversion altogether as it was largely irrelevant. I wish I hadn't brought it up because it just confused the issue.\n\n \n that would be treasury level inflaiton or monetary inflation. The dollar has declined in value on the forex market, which has lowered its value on the international trade market. The argumetn about a basket of currencies did not confuse the issue, it merely illustrated that you had no idea what you were talking about and only a fool would believe otherwise. \n \n \n \nLet's look at this a little closer. If it were true that \"inflation\" of the U.S. dollar was significant, it would follow that the Chinese would be particularly interested in unpegging their currency (the Yuan) to the dollar. Who wants to swap finished goods for a depreciating currency? \n\n \n No, they wouldn't. they are intentionally keeping their currency low in order to be able to move manufatured goods at cut rates. They convert those dollars to Euros or Yuan (since very litttle of chinas cash reserves are still held directly in dollars). Mostly they are converting to yuan. When they DO unpeg from the dollar finally, or move the peg, those yuan revlaue overnight. If current estimates are correct, they are looking at a 40% upward revaluation overnight. Go to bed tuesday with $100, wake up wednesday mornign with $140. Now multiply that by 20 trillion. Get the idea?\n \n \n\n Has anyone ever heard the Saudis complaining about the value of the dollar? \n \n \n Thats because they generally don't discuss such things on the editorial page, whcih is where you seem to get most of your news and world views. Prior to the invasion of Iraq, the Sauds were seriously considering switching to a mixed payment system (where they accepeted euros or dollars). The US moved to stop this. At the next OPEC conference Saudi Arabis pushed for $45-$50/bbl. this was the direct result of dollar decline.\n \n \nI haven't. It is true that the Europeans received a benefit from an appreciating Euro as their Euros will purchase more dollars which will be used to buy oil since oil is denominated in dollars. That much is true. But it is not true to extrapolate from that benefit that \"inflation\" or \"dollar inflation\" (or whatever one chooses to call it) is the reason for the price of oil going up (it is now coming down BTW). What is true beyond all dispute is that an expanding economy in the U.S, China, India and elsewhere with a growing appetite for crude oil will rachet up the price of oil. It is a natural result of economics and we don't need to spin elaborate and silly arguments about \"inflation\" driving the price of crude.\n\n \n Except that stockpiles are at an all time high, but prices are still over 50% higher than they were 6 years ago. This blows your idea out of the water. Supply has increased faster than demand, which should lead to reduced costs. It has not.\n \n Additionally, you keep dwelling on the euro. The dollar has declined against all major currencies, including the yen, despite massive efforts by the japanese to drop the yen.",

While I think you are correct as things now stand, I think it is too early to form any concrete thoughts as far as ultimate value of the Euro. While it is currently higher than it probably should be for a healthy european economy, Euro value is based on the relative strength of the EU, which ultimately has a much further reach than just Europe. \n \n They (the EU) are building what may well become a formidable base of cheap labor, which should return them to the manufacturing field as real competitors. \n \n I think this is why there seesm to be so much trouble as far as valuaiton of the Euro goes. It is not like other currencies where you can just pluck economic datat from the issuing nation and use it to calcualte value. Independant movement of the Euro seems to be more based (at least to some extent) on EU progress. I have noticed that when things do not go well in the EU, the euro will dip (such as disputes of EU constitution, etc...). \n \n Personally, I would still call the euro a long term buy against the dollar. Their plan seems to be a good one....combine the industrial know how of western europe with cheap labor from eastern europe and the ME without import/export problems. From a financial standpoint, it would be like the US annexing mexico and their wage structure.",

Once the demand slowed down investors (speculators if you wish to name them so) pulled their money out because of the future prospect of oil...which in other words means that the prices were going down, which means that investors would lose money if they didn't pull out and sold their shares. This doesn't mean that it was all a sham. It simply wasn't it. The demand was there before all this happened, that's why investors bought in oil and made money in it. Therefore this speculation is based on a solid evidence that oil was going down due to decrease in demand. The speculators did not drive the price up, it was the demand of oil (especially by China). Speculators just bought in it to make a buck. Simple as that.",

And if not, does anyone know the formula to compute what it should be at, because I believe it's still comparatively high at around 1.85 per gallon. Is this a consensus opinion or do you disagree?\n\n \n One main reason that gas does not fall as fast as it rises, especially after a big run-up like this is that refiners and distributers get squeezed just as badly, if not worse than the rest of us when oil prices go up. The real winners are those who are just straight producers such as Saudi Aramco, Pemex, Petrobras, etc. In the middle are companies such as Exxon Mobile which drills, refines, and sells. It certainly wasn't hurting, but ultimately does better when prices are low and people are buying a lot. The losers are the Sheetzes, WaWa's, and other distributers who can't raise their prices fast enough to keep up with costs. When oil finally does come down, they try to recoup some of their losses and only bring prices down slowly. \n \n As someone with a tiny car and a 5 mile commute who works for a company that sells mainly to oil producers, I admit feeling guiltily pleased when prices are high. But hey, there are millions of Americans like me who's jobs depend on oil companies doing well.",
