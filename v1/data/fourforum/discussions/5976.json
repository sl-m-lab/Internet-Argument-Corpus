   "Should Saddam get the death penalty? If he does, I bet he won't get twenty years to plead for a retrial.\n \nBAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) - The first criminal case has been filed against Saddam Hussein, stemming from the 1982 massacre of dozens of Shiite villagers in retaliation for a failed assassination attempt against the former leader, the head of an Iraqi tribunal said Sunday.\n The date for the trial of Saddam and three others will be determined in a few days. If convicted, they could face the death penalty.\n -snip-\n The tribunal will try the former dictator on war crimes charges stemming from 14 incidents, according to a list obtained by The Associated Press. Those incidents include the 1987-88 campaign to drive Iraqi Kurds from wide areas of the north and the 1991 suppression of a Shiite revolt in the south after U.S.-led forces removed Iraqi invaders from Kuwait.\n Saddam also is being investigated for a 1988 chemical weapons attack on the Kurdish town of Halabja that killed an estimated 5,000 people and the execution of 8,000 members of the Barzani tribe, a powerful Kurdish clan to which the current Kurdistan Democratic Party leader, Massoud Barzani, belongs.\n\n Source",

Hell, under muslim law, adultery is punishable by death. Why would killing tens of thousands of your own citizens not subject one to death? \n \n This man deserves whatever punishment he is given. I would like to see him hung like a dog from the archway of one of his former palaces.",

Why wasn't he left in cold storage until real Iraqi problems have been addressed?\n\n \n It makes for an interesting distraction for the Iraqi people. Looking at some of the media coverage, it appears to be a rather pthetic attempt to refocus Iraqis from the occupation to a celebrity trial. It works for hte US public, it will be interesting to see if Iraqis are as flighty.\n \n Personally, I doubt it. People who have real problems like massive unemployment, widespread poverty starvation, lack of drinking water, people blowing up their families, etc... Are not easily distracted.",
