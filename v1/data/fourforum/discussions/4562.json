   "The topic of this thread is whether Archaeopteryx is an evolutionary transitional and why/why not.\n \n Before we do anything else, we should define what we are talking about when we use the word, \"transitional.\" Clearly the word must indicate some sort of change from one thing to another and that is what is meant by evolutionary biologists. Transitionals are sometimes called intermediates in the same sense, that they are intermediate forms between two others, one older ancestral form and one younger descendent form.\n \n Before I go on let me correct a wrong impression that I may have conveyed by the above statements. Because we are defining transitionals (or intermediates) as being between two other forms does not imply that we can point out the specific ancestral species or any specific descendent species. In fact, any specific transitional may have actually been a dead end, en evolutionary lineage that went extinct. Detailed assertions about lineage are generally and understandably too fine grained to be represented in the fossil record.\n \n So it must be clear from the start that in speaking about transitional species I am talking about broad lineages of descent, not descent from one specific fossil through a second to a third. In the case of Archaeopteryx we are saying that the the 7 skeletal fossils show a mix of characteristics, some that are more like an ancestral lineage (in this case, a lineage of dinosaur) and some descendent lineage (in this case, birds). If evolutionary theory is correct, then we should expect that such fossils would be found, that is, fossils that carry a mixture of characteristics between two lineages.\n \n Thus, in calling Archaeopteryx a transitional form I am saying that it has a mixture of characteristics, some more like a theropod (more specifically a maniraptorian) dinosaur, and others more like modern birds. This is an old theory evolutionary biology. On the Origin of Species was published in 1859. T.H. Huxley, a friend of Darwin's and a fellow naturalist commented about the theory of natural selection, \"How stupid of me not to have seen that.\" In 1860, noticing the similarity between birds and some of the small dinosaurs that were being discovered, Huxley hypothesized that birds were descended from dinosaurs and predicted that fossil forms would be found with a mixture of characteristics. Archaeopteryx was found in 1861.\n \n OK. That's the basics. As long as we are talking about the same thing. Keep in mind that there is no claim being made that Archaeopteryx is ancestral to all birds or any bird. It is an example of several lineages that most certainly existed that evolved from maniraptorian theropods. One of those lineages gave rise to the birds.\n \n I'll leave it there for now and begin working on discussions of specific characterists of dinosaurs, birds, and Archaeopteryx and who has which one.",

   "So any discussion of Archaeopteryx has to start with the obvious. Archy had feathers! Not only that, Archy had asymetrical filght feathers. As I reported on another site about the single feather found in the Solnhofen quarry in 1860, \"The feather in about 60mm long and 11 mm wide with a central rachis that divides the feather into two asymmetrical vanes, one about twice as wide as the other. The asymetrical vanes show it to be a flight feather of a bird, and as such, there is nothing really remarkable about it, except that it is about 150 million years old.\"\n \n Of the 7 skeletal specimens, feather impressions are visible on 6. On some they are striking. On others they are barely visible under precise lighting. The Solnhofen Specimen (S6) (in private hands), discovered sometime in the 1960s, was clasified as Compsagnathus. Huxley had commented that an Archaeopteryx without feathers looked like a small dinosaur. In fact, it looked remarkably like a Compsognathus (of \"Jurassic Park\" fame). Thus, 3 of the first 6 specimens were classified as dinosaurs or a pterosaur. In 1988, after cleaning and preparation, the feather impressions on the Solnhofen Specimen became quite clear.\n \n The Teyler Specimen (TM 6428) is actually the first one discovered (1855). It was classified as the type specimen of a pterosaur, Pterodactylus crassipes. In 1970, John Ostrom of Yale University, while doing a survey of pterosaur fossils in the Museums of Europe was given access to this valuable fossil. The museum curator left him alone to study the fossil. In order to get a better look, he carried it to a window (the Teyler Museum is a natural light museum) to look at it under the bright sunlight. As he held the specimen at various angles he noticed that when the sunlight shone across the surface at an angle he could see feather impressions. He realized immediately what he had in his hands. He returned to the work table, knowing that the curator had already granted Ostrom permission to take the fossil back to the U.S. for further study. Ostrom reported that he had a brief inner battle. The thought crossed his mind not to say anything at that time and report his discovery only later, after returning to the States. But he realized that he couldn't do that out of respect for a colleague who had already been so gracious and kind to him. He sat for a time waiting for the curator to return. When he did, he took him to the window where he held the fossil at the correct angle for the curator to see. The curator was speechless. He too knew immediately what he had. Ostrom reported that the curator took the fossil and hurried off without a word. Ostrom sat down and was mourning the loss of a chance to study the fossil more closely. After a bit the curator returned with a box tied with string and handed it to Ostrom. He said to Ostrom, \"Of course, you will have the honor of describing it.\" Thus was discovered the 4th specimen of Archaeopteryx (other than the feather).\n \n The Eichst\u00e4tt Specimen (JM2257) was found in 1951 and also classified as a Comsognathus. While studying it in 1973 F.X. Mayr realized that the proportions of the front limbs to the rear were incorrect for a Compy but agreed quite nicely with Archy's proportions.\n \n So, without feathers, Archy looks like a dinosaur. But Ernst Mayr, the recently deceased ornithologist and evolutionary theorist at Harvard, after having seen the Berlin specimen said to Alan Feduccia (UNC), \"The thing that strikes me about Archaeopteryx, Alan: that it's a bird.[/i]\n \n Well, an ornithologist would say that. Even World Book Encyclopedia used to begin the entry on birds with, \"A Bird is an animal with feathers.\" That's pretty clear, and back when Mayr saw the Berlin specimen, and when Feduccia later saw it, and when World Book started the article that way it was true. All birds had feathers and anything with feathers was a bird.\n \n So does the fact that Archy has feathers disqualify it as a transitional? Are such claims nothing more than the desparate gasps of the anti-God conspiracy, evolution? NAAH! I'll say it once more and I'll repeat it to the point of nausea. Archy looks like a dinosaur with feathers.\n \n In fact, Hoyle, et al. published probably the best photographs of the London specimen yet in a journal of photography and claimed to demonstrate that it is a forgery. Hoyle, because of his status as a respected scientist, was even granted unusual access to the fossil and even allowed to take a sample. When Hoyle claimed to have found a foreign substance on the surface of the fossil and therefore evidence of forgery, the staff of the British Museum laughed. They informed him that it was the preservative and any competent paleontologist would expect it to be present and either ignore it or remove it before testing. Hoyle, an astronomer, demanded another sample. The Museum cut off his access completely. Once he had conclusively demonstrated his incompetence in paleontolgy, there didn't seem to be any reason to give him any further consideration.\n \n So what about the feathers? I've got a picture of the Berlin specimen, what some have called the most beautiful fossil in the world, and I've got a reproduction hanging on my wall (purchased with my wife's permission when I was pulling down significant $$$). It is a jolting admixture, an obvious small dinosaur with magnificent feathers.\n \n So are the feathers enough to disqualify Archy from being a transitional? Most certainly not. In fact, the feathers mark it as most definitely transitional. Because of the feathers it was classified in the Linnean system as belonging to the Class Aves. I don't have any argument with that and I think that Mayr may have meant that. Certainly, as an ornithologist, Mayr recognized that Archy wasn't similar to any bird that he had ever seen before. Even Feduccia, who creationists like to quote because he rejects the bird from theropod theory, believes that birds evolved from archosaurs. To Feduccia Archy is a transitional between archosaurs and modern birds, which only presents larger gaps in the fossil record.\n \n So the bottom line is that feathers on an otherwise appearing dinosaur are evidence that it is transitional rather than the opposite. It is unreasonable and illogical to demand evidence for the fine grained evolution of the feather when considering the status of Archy. Archy doesn't show intermediate stages in the evolution of feathers. Archy shows intermediate stages in the evolution of an entire class of organisms. Isn't that what Gould said?\n \n But it is not unreasonable to ask if there is any evidence that can be used to demonstrate the evolution of feathers. It is quite a legitimate question. In fact, it is one that many evolutionary biologists have asked themselves. And the question is being answered on a couple of fronts. China has recently become more receptive to paleontological investigations inside her boarders. There are many respected paleontologists in China, some of whom earned their degrees (creds if you will) in the U.S. and Great Britain. In cooperation with foreign scientists, they have opened vast fossil deposits to the \"west\". In those deposits there have been found several dinosaurs with structures that seem to be exactly what evolutionary science would predict as evolutionary stages in the evolution of feathers. So now it seems that while a bird may be an animal with feathers, not all animals with feathers are birds.\n \n Beyond that, modern technology has enabled scientists to study the development of feathers in modern organisms. These studies do not support the 'feather from scale' hypothesis. They do offer a sequence for feather development that is reflected in the fossil record. I mentioned in another thread a popular article by Prum and Bush in \"Scientific American\" where they linked their evo-devo studies of feathers with the recently discovered paleontological record. I am one who is inclined to accept that the convergence of several independent lines of scientific inquiry is meaningful. Thus, the fossil record, microscopic studies of development, DNA analysis, morphology, and several other field of inquiry all reach the same conclusions. Feathers are evidence of the evolutionary status of Archeopteryx as a transitional species.\n \n You must understand that I am at no advantage to anyone on this board when it comes to such questions. My formal training precedes even the serious consideration of the bird from dinosaur theory. But the topic interests me and I have sought information and done some reading - all of it published many years after my formal education. What I know about current theory, anyone can know. But it does take time and an open mind.\n \n So, after discussion to this point (only scratching the surface), let's procede with teeth. Name a bird that has any.",

   "So, after discussion to this point (only scratching the surface), let's procede with teeth. Name a bird that has any.\n \n I realize that I haven't given you a chance to respond, but I'm going to continue. Feel free to cut right in and name a bird with teeth.\n \n The question is, of course, loaded. There are several birds with teeth that could be named. The problem is that none of them are living. Every species of bird that had teeth is extinct and known only through the fossil record. That is not to say, or course, that toothed birds never existed. There are several examples. Of course, Archaeopteryx is one. Archy had teeth - real pointy, sharp, serated teeth that are quite typical of theropod predators. Archy's teeth are indistinguishable from those of Compsognathus, a theropod dinosaur.\n \n The skull of the London specimen of Archaeopteryx is so badly damaged (geological forces are not kind to paper thin bones) that it is for the most part useless in discovering morphological features. However, there is preserved on the plate, a short distance from the crushed head, a jaw fragment with teeth. It was assumed that this fragment was from some other specimen. Everyone knew that birds don't have teeth. I really can't fault anyone for this error. Given that no known bird had teeth, how could anyone logically associate a separated jaw segment with teeth with the primary fossil of a bird. It wasn't a bad assumption, merely a wrong one. And that assumption may have contributed to the mis-identification of other Archy fossils.\n \n When the Berlin specimen (called the most beautiful fossil in the world) was discovered, all that changed. Even though the skull was damaged, it was clear that Archy had teeth, real pointy, sharp, serated teeth.\n \n So we might consider teeth as a transitional characteristic in Archaeopteryx. Remember, we defined a transitional as an organism that embodied a mixture of characteristics between an ancestral lineage and a descendant lineage.. So now we see that Archaeopteryx had true flight feathers of descendand birds, and the teeth of the ancestral maniraptorian theropod dinosaur.\n \n So we now have, after considering only two characteristics, an example of a true transitional species. Archaeopteryx has the feathers of a flighted bird and the teeth of a maniraptor.\n \n (By the way, please disregard spelling errors.

   "No. You're not making it up. Lots of birds have egg teeth, which are not really teeth as in the sense that dinosaurs had teeth and Archaeopteryx had teeth, and in fact, birds like the Hesperornis and kin, Mesozoic aquatic birds, had a nifty set of teeth. The were highly adapted to an aquatic life to the extent that they couldn't have walked on land and they had no wings. The only thing remaining was a short humerus.\n \n Anyway, an egg tooth is developmentally different from teeth, being just a hard growth in the top of the beak. It is used to help crack the shell. Embryological studies have shown that birds do form \"tooth buds\" as they develop but they never develop into teeth. They are reabsorbed. However, there was an experiment done with embryonic chicken tissue in which teeth were induced to grow. They were sharp, pointy things like Hesperornis, Archaeopteryx, and maniraptors.\n \n However, the Hoatzin is probably the bird with claws you were thinking about. As nestlings Hoatzins have two clawed fingers on their wings. Apparently they use the claws for climbing in trees before they have learned to fly. They do it to escape predators. Shipman says that the claws \"disappear\" when they leave the nest. I don't know if that means they are lost or are hidden in the feathers and are no longer used. Shipman says, \"Although the hand claws of the nestling hoatzins are not an evolutionary retention from some Archaeopteryx-like ancestor but an independent development, the comparison is irresistible.\" Most other sources that I have seen can't seem to resist the comparison.",

   "In looking at only two characteristics I have already demonstrated that Archaeopteryx is a transitional. Biologists define a transitional species as an organism that shows a mix of characteristics of two (and only two) other lineages. So far I have talked about Archaeopteryx's feathers, characteristic of birds, and the teeth, characteristic of dinosaurs, and even reptiles. It doesn't matter that there are other birds that also had teeth. Those birds were late Mesozoic and are now extinct. And it doesn't matter that there were dinosaurs that had feathers too.\n \n But let's talk about feet. Think about the feet on some typical reptile. Doesn't look much like a bird's foot, does it? Now think about the creatures depicted in movies like \"Jurassic Park,\" like the T. rex and the velociraptors. Three toes with a 4th shorter toe towards the inside. A lot more bird like, aren't they. In fact, the whole group of dinosaurs belong to a group named for those feet, the avepods - and that means, literally, bird-foot. The first fossil prints of these kinds of dinosaurs found were attributed to giant birds. If you have the occasion to visit Dinosaur Valley State Park outside of Glen Rose, Texas you can see the tridactyl prints that were probably made by an Acrocanthosaurus, a theropod dinosaur.\n \n Now if you have occasion to examine the foot of a bird, you will probably notice the similarity first. But closer examination will reveal a significant difference. The 1st digit, the short one on the dino-avepod, is rotated around the foot. Instead of being in line with the rest of the digits, it is 180 degrees out, facing backwards. This is what gives birds the ability to sit on a perch. This rotated 1st digit is called the hallux. Without this adaption birds couldn't perch on tree branches or telephone wires.\n \n The hallux may have been somewhat reversed in some dinosaurs. There are indications that the hallux may have been dereversed during fossilization, for example, Compsognathus. This has also been observed in preserved specimens of kiwi. If such specimens were fossilized there is speculation that the hallux could be dereversed as much as fossilized avepods. In other specimens where we would like to look for such characteristics, they are not well preserved or are disarticulated. Therefore it cannot be determined the amount of reversal of the hallux.\n \n But Archaeopteryx has a strongly reversed hallux. In fact, it is a lovely example of a transitional feature - just what creationists have ordered. The hallux of Archaeopteryx was not reversed to the extend that it is in modern birds. It would have made Archaeopteryx quite capable of perching.\n \n Another feature that some paleontologists suggest in Archaeopteryx is a hyperextendible middle toe. This would be a characteristic retained from its dinosaur ancestry. Such a characteristic can be found in the sickle-clawed dromaeosaurs and troodonts. Of course, the sickle-claw at the end of that hyperextended toe was a killing claw.\n \n So the feet of Archaeopteryx are most definitely another feature that shows Archaeopteryx to be a transitional, being a mix of birdlike and dinosaur like characteristics.",

   "I remember when I was young that sometimes my mother would roast a chicken on Sunday, or a Turkey on Thanksgiving and Christmas. I remember that inside were stuffed the heart, liver, and gizzard, and she had to remove these before cooking, along with the long, bony, whiplike tail. My brothers and I used to vie for the tail because the whoever got it could lord it over the others the rest of the day, using the tail as a switch. With just the right stroke you could raise a welt that lasted the rest of the day.\n \n What? Chickens and turkeys don't have long, bony, whiplike tails? Maybe you aren't aware of just how old I am? Let me check my books.\n \n Actually, everyone knows that birds tails are composed of feathers that are attached to a small, stubby structure. That structure is known as a pygostyle and is composed of only a few fused vertebrae. All extant birds have only a pygostyle and not anything remotely akin to a tail that one might see on a lizard or other reptile. I'm sure that everyone found my suggestion of a bird with a long, bony tail composed of free vertebrae silly. If something had a tail like that you could reasonably claim that it certainly was not a bird.\n \n Well then, just look at Archaeopteryx! There it is, in all known specimens with that tail of free vertebrae that is longer than the entire rest of the animal. And yet, creationists claim that it is just a bird, based for the most part on the presence of feathers. Wouldn't it be just as logical to claim that it was just a dinosaur based on the tail? and the teeth? and the claws on the wings? Archaeopteryx was a dinosaur, one with feathers that could probably fly, but a dinosaur nevertheless.\n \n But in a transitional species between dinosaurs and birds we would expect it to have some features that are more bird-like, while others are more dinosaur-like. Evolution does not predict or claim that any organism will suddenly produce a completely different organism. Evolution predicts that any changes will be more gradual, taking place over a long period of time, with different characteristics developing at different times and at different rates. Thus, Archaeopteryx has the feathers of a bird (and has been classified according to the Linnean system as such) and the tail of a dinosaur (and has been placed closer to them than birds in cladograms). And Archaeopteryx even has feathers on that dinosaur tail.\n \n By the way, cladistically speaking, not only was Archaeopteryx a dinosaur, so are the grackles and jays in my back yard. But the smallest dinosaurs are the hummingbirds.",

Other members of the subfamily are the blackbirds, orioles and meadowlarks. They are bigger than a blackbird but smaller than a crow.\n \n All birds are equally related to dinosaurs. The large radiation of bird species happened after the K-T event. However, some species found at the end of the Cretaceous (65mya) do appear to be directly related to modern species. Shipman says, \"The earliest specimens are related to modern birds with aquatic adaptions...although many of the ancient species seem to combine features of several modern forms rather than being clearly ancestral to any single one. There are also hints in the fossil record of the lineage leading to the ratites--the group of flightless birds including emus, ostriches, and rheas...\"",

   "Even though no one quibbled over chicken tails when they were children, many of you probably did over the furcula. You probably know it as the wishbone. The furcula if formed by fused clavicles.\n \n The furcula was formerly known only in birds. It functions as a spring loaded anchor point for some of the flight muscles. It's presence in Archaeopteryx if one of the reasons why some have been so insistant to classify Archy as a bird, even though feathers and the furcula are the only characteristics of flight that are clarly present in Archy. The thought was the Archy must clearly be a bird since dinosaurs don't have furcula, and even the clavicles were in doubt.\n \n And then not only clavicles, but furcula were discovered in some dinosaurs, and they are exactly the dinosaurs that one would expect to find them if archy were descended for dinosaurs.\n \n Furculae have been identified in several basal avetheropods like Scipionyx and Allosaurus (tyrannosaurids), Gorgosaurus and Daspletosaurus (dino-avepectorans), Sinornithosaurus, velociraptorine dromaeosaurs, Velociraptor, Ingenia, and Oviraptor.\n \n So is the furcula in Archaeopteryx a transitional character? Certainly. Most dinosaurs didn't even seem to have clavicles, although they may have been cartilage (unossified) that did not fossilize well. Certainly there is not sign of fused clavicles. Until one reaches the avetheropods, the hypthesized ancestral lineage to birds. Then we begin to see fused clavicles that form furculae. But obviously they were not used in flying by terrestrial dinosaurs. The function of the furcula is a matter of speculation in such animals, but whatever the function, it was adapted by birds for flight.\n \n So we can add another line to the chart (for those of you keeping score at home). Reptiles, no; dinosaurs, some; Archaeopteryx, yes; birds, yes.",

   "One thing I didn't include in the discussion of teeth that probably should have been included.\n \n Interdental plates have been identified even in archosaurs. They are present in many subsequent lineages, including thecodont reptiles and many dinosaures, while they were apparently fused to the jaw in others. One lineage in which interdental plates were retained was the theropods and subsequent lineages including the maniraptors. Now the reason that I should have discussed this characteristic with teeth is probably pretty obvious. Birds don't have teeth. But the last specimen of Archaeopteryx discovered, the Solnhofen Aktien-Verein Specimen (1992) BSP 1999, (Archaeopteryx bavarica) has interdental plates clearly visible on the lower jaw. Clearly a transitional characteristic.\n \n I also have failed to mention the Linnean classification of Archy. The scientific name is Archaeopteryx lithografica. Archaeopteryx name means \"ancient wing\" and lithografica refers to the primary use of the plates from the Solnhofen quarry. The deposits are a very fine-grained, golden colored limestone. The extracted slabs were split along bedding planes and yielded a smooth, uniform surface, excellent for the engraving of lithographic plates. In 1992, quarrymen split a slab and found the Solnhofen Aktien-Verein Specimen. They knew what they had at once. This specimen is the smallest of all, even though it appears to be an adult. It has other characteristics that suggest that it is not the same species as A. lithografica. The Eichst\u00e4tt Specimen (1973) JM 2257 is also quite small, and while some have hypothesized that it is a separate species, the poor ossification of several bones, especially the shoulders, have led others to believe that it may be a juvenile.\n \n Sorry for the disjointed nature of these posts. I'm working from some old notes and a couple of books that I haven't looked at for some years. I'm sure that you are all aware that my posts don't have the concise, logical flow of a scientific paper. I'm just trying to tell you what I have learned from an extended period of study of the topic. I'm also trying to introduce a bit of humor in the mix (hence the chicken tails and the grackles).\n \n So to add to the chart:\n \n Interdental plates: reptiles, yes; dinosaurs, most; Archaeopteryx, yes; birds, no.\n \n Without \"dental\" there can't be \"interdental.\"",

They're more than plentiful on the Canadian prairies.\n \n I've killed more Grackles in my day than I could ever count. :p There used to be hundreds of them around the farm and the cottage - then I got a BB gun. Grackles, Crows and Magpies were the only \"game\" I was allowed to shoot, seeing as how they pick on song birds and are generally annoying. Given that Crows and Magpies were nearly impossible, and Grackles were plentiful, and I had nothing but time, well, they paid the price. To this day Grackles are pretty rare around the cottage. \n \n The \"chuck\" \"chuck\" of a Grackle still annoys the heck outta me. :p \n \n Waxy\n \n P.S.

   "Thanks for the kind words, Waxy.\n \n I had never heard of a grackle until I moved to Texas. Growing up in Montana we had Brewer's blackbirds that look a lot like grackles (even to the yellow eyes) but are smaller. In the spring (like now) Brewer's blackbirds migrate through here, as do red-wing blackbirds. They also hang around the bird feeder but are more willing to share, but they are also agressive enough to feed along side the grackles. Grackles are about 1 to 1 1/2 ft long and hog the feeder. Grackles are here all year long. One species lives along the Gulf coast. I'm about 80 miles inland and that species (boat-tailed grackle) doesn't even get this far inland.",

   "I thought I'd come back to the transitional features of Archaeopteryx with an easy characteristic - the beak.\n \n Everyone knows that birds have beaks in a variety of sizes and shapes, and therefore functions. Some birds are basically vegetarian, and their beaks are made to crack seeds. This feature in the Galapagos finch led to the realization that, even though they are remarkably similar in other respects, they form different species according to their preferred food source.\n \n The beaks of predatory birds like eagles, hawks and owls are hooked. Along with the sharp talons such birds are able to rip out chunks of flesh from the prey.\n \n There is also another characteristic that is linked to teeth and beaks and allowed the teeth in birds to be replaced by beaks. Even archosaurs swallowed stones that were utilized to grind food in the gizzard. This characteristic was carried through to the lineages from which birds evolved, while it was lost in the synapsids lineages that led to mammals. The teeth of carnivorous dinosaurs are made for slicing chunks of meat from the prey. The teeth were complete with serated edges for the purpose. But the food was probably swallowed in large chunks and masticated in the gizzard.\n \n Thus, the loss of teeth and the large muscles necessary for mastication is seen as a flight adaption. These losses reduced the mass of the head, which besides reducing overall weight, shifted the center of gravity back in the body, which allowed the long boney tail to also be reduced.\n \n So birds have beaks, while reptiles, dinosarus and Archaeopteryx didn't. One mesozoic bird that I mentioned before, Hesperornis, had a reduced set of teeth (in the back of the jaw only) in the upper jaw and a reduced beak on the front of the upper jaw only.\n \n And so, even though Archaeopteryx is called a bird, and classified in the Linnean system as a bird, it lacks a feature of all birds, the beak. Instead, Archaeopteryx has a jaw with teeth and no beak (not to mention interdental plates) that is typical of theropod dinosaurs.",

   "If you take your finger and poke your chest exactly in the middle, from depression between the ends of your clavicles to the solar plexus, the point where the bone ends, you are poking your sternum. Underneath is your heart and the upper ribs are fused to the sternum. Your sternum is a flat bony plate that serves as an anchor to muscles of the upper chest that connect to the bones of the upper arm an shoulder.\n \n Now I'm sure that you will understand that an animal that uses the bones of the upper arm to propell it in flight would probably have very large pectoral muscles, i.e., the muscles that attach between the sternum and the upper arm. Now it is a principle of anatomy that the larger the muscle, the larger the point of attachment to bone. Thus, gorillas have a huge sagital crest that extends perpendicular to the skull to which are anchored the jaw muscles necessary to chew their coarse vegetible diet.\n \n In a like manner, birds have developed a \"crest\" that is part of and perpendicular to the sternum that anchors the pectoral muscles. That structure is called the carina. I'm sure that you have all seen it on the remants of the chicken or turkey on your dinner table. The carina is a characteristic of flighted birds, although even non-flying modern birds have one.\n \n Well, such a prominent structure is invisible, if it was present, on all but one Archaeopteryx specimen. And in that case, the carina is quite small. This would be an indication of a very weak flyer.\n \n So reptiles and dinosaurs didn't have a carina. Archaeopteryx has a visible (small) carina on only one of 7 specimens, and all birds have rather large carinas.",
