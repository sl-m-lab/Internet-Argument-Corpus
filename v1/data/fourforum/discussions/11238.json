The thing to keep in mind is that planes don't push off on the ground like, for example, cars do. They pull themselves through the air. The prop is pulling the plane forwards at 30 mph, relative to the stationary ground, and the treadmill goes the other way at 30 mph. Thus, the wheels are spinning at 60 mph, but that's fine since they aren't powered, they can spin as fast as they like without the engine having to do more work. You could speed the treadmill up to the point where the wheels melt and the plane would still be able to take off.\n \n Now that you mention it, I don't think it would actually be possible to hold a plane still on a treadmill running at takeoff speed. Props have a mimimum speed, they produce a minimum thrust. I strongly suspect (and can probably confirm if anyone cares enough) that thrust is well above that needed to hold a plane steady on a treadmill, given that all it really needs to do is overcome the friction of the wheels.",

Many scientific questions are approached in that fashion.

They pull themselves through the air. The prop is pulling the plane forwards at 30 mph, relative to the stationary ground, and the treadmill goes the other way at 30 mph. Thus, the wheels are spinning at 60 mph, but that's fine since they aren't powered, they can spin as fast as they like without the engine having to do more work. You could speed the treadmill up to the point where the wheels melt and the plane would still be able to take off.\n\n \n Good explanation. It makes perfect sense.",

So if it's moving forward at 30 mph, with respect to the air, and the treadmill is going 40 mph the other way, all that means is that the wheels are spinning at 70 mph.

   "Increased, I think you meant.\nNo. I meant decreased.\n \n First, let's clear up some cloudy areas in the scene. One must assume that the wheel brakes on the plane are not applied, that the pilot has applied thrust via the propeller enough to overcome the wheel friction that he always encounters when attempting to roll forward, then the ground under (via the belt) starts to move backward. This is essentially what happened when the full scale experiment was done with the truck and the tarp. The only effect the moving tarp had on the airplane wheels was to spin them faster. This slowed the airplane's progress relative to the real stationary world by only a slight amount...nonetheless it put the plane slightly behind where it would have been had the tarp stayed put. Thus when the plane reached flight speed, it should have been a bit closer to where it started than if the tarp had stayed put. That's all I'm saying. The distance that the plane is moved backward by the tarp depends on the the speed of the tarp's motion and the friction of the wheels...with neither of these significantly affecting the outcome.\n \n What is confusing is the initial thought of a very short treadmill when in actuality it takes a treadmill whose flat topside is longer than the take-off distance required for the airplane because once the thrust is applied by the prop against the air, there is no connection between the treadmill and the plane except in vertical support and reactions. The horizontal movement of the plane is not restrained so it moves toward the opposite end of the treadmill. Only if it reaches takeoff speed before the end of the treadmill will it successfully take off.\n \n In the set up videos, the idea of a short treadmill is fixed in your mind. In the real full size experiment, it would not have made much difference whether they pulled the tarp or not...the plane would have taken off in about the same distance, given the same wind conditions.\n \n \n \n\n Sure, all that you say is true. I'm just anticipating future trouble here. I wouldn't want anyone to say \"but your theory is based on fricitionless wheels, which don't exist, so you're completely wrong!\". Given that we have an actually real world experiment to consider it seemed appropriate to specify just how much of a difference there would be between \"perfection\" and \"reality\". Simplifying assumptions work great for those who understand what's going on to start with, but I find they often confuse those who don't have a good grasp of what's going on; they don't always get just how little effect your assumption makes on the final answer.\n..and in this case, the friction of the wheels make so little difference we probably could not detect it without ultra-sensitive instruments.\n \n It would be interesting to consider what would happen in the same experiment repeated at various levels of wheel-brake application, using parameters such as tire pressure, diameter, braking torque, all three wheels or just two, the speed of the belt and such like that, but I'm due to consider something worthwhile here shortly.\n \n \nOk. If the aircraft builds an indicated airspeed of 30mph, yes, it will take off regardless of how fast the treadmill is moving under it. The treadmill could move 150mph backwards, the plane will still only require 30mph IAS to take off. \n \n The scenario seems to me to be poorly worded.

Why are you complicating it? Simply put, based on the hypothetical as defined, I don't see how if the light travels at the speed of light, and the car is traveling at the speed of light as proffered, then the light wont get in front of the car at all. The speed will neutralize the ability of the light to light the cars path.\n \n \nOne of the upshots of this is that light always travels at the same speed, regardless of observer.\n \n \n This is not a reliable assumption at all. Especially since we are still dealing with a hypothetical. If you want to get technical though, read on:\n \n http://www.aloha.net/~johnboy/Quantum_Thought.htg/thought.htm\n The immediate space surrounding an object is expanded and the space between objects (distance) in space is compressed. Thus \"gravity\" is a \"push / pull\" force that only seems like an exclusively attracting force that is actually a compressing force.\n \n It follows (to me anyway) that our measurement of the speed of light is inaccurate (insufficient) because we are measuring light speed in compressed space. \n \n Light travels slower through compressed space which is why, according to Stephen Hawking, a space ship navigating through the event horizon of a black hole would appear to a distant observer as stopped while the occupants of the space ship would experience velocity.  \n \n The space near a black hole is highly compressed, light velocity remains the same (Pi x 100,000,000 or 314,159,265.4 meters per second ) however from the perspective of a distant observer light speed only appears to be slowing because of the compression of space. \n \n footnote: Space immediately surrounding an object is sretched. Space between objects is compressed. \n \n Gravitational fields seem to bend light but the light only appears to be affected by the gravitational field. The field that is affecting the flow of light is caused by the warp of space created by the presence of matter displacing the immediate surrounding space. \n It is at this juncture that Stephen Hawking enters the playing field. Hawking's credentials are as impressive as Albert Einstein's and Isaac Newton's. Stephen determines that there is a theoretical place in the universe that contains huge quantities of matter that have attained \"infinite density\" (a teaspoon full is estimated to weigh hundreds of tons). Stephen calls these warped vortices \"black holes\" because light cannot escape from the black hole's massive gravitational influence. \n It is theorized that the escape velocity (the speed necessary to break free of a gravitational influence) for a black hole exceeds the speed of light. Since light speed is the maximum speed limit in the universe then it seems that once you are in a black hole there is no escape (unless you can find a way to go faster than light and then presumably go back in time and avoid entering the blackhole in the first place).",

This is a hypothetical, and it say's this: If I am in a car traveling at the speed of light, and I turn the headlights on...do they do anything?

Nothing can go at the speed of light, it is a physical impossibility. It's not a matter of \"we just need big enough engines\", the laws of the universe are such that it can't be done.

Why are you complicating it?\n\n I'm not complicating it, the universe is. It has been proven, experimentaly, that you can't talk about things travelling near the speed of light and get the right answers unless you use relativity. When you travel near the speed of light time and space act differently than they do when you're sitting still, if you don't take that into account you can't predict what's going to happen accurately.\n \n And concerning the speed of light, I should have said \"the speed of light through a given medium is a constant\". Since the scenario we're dealing with doesn't involve light travelling through different mediums I left the \"given nedium\" part off. The important point is that light speed isn't additive. If you're on a train doing 30 mgh, and you throw a ball forwards at 20 mph, the ball will be going 20 mph relative to someone in the train and 50 mph relative to the ground, right? But if you're in a space car going .9 c, and you shine your headlights how fast will the light seem to go? c, as observed from both inside and outside the car.

There has been nothing said yet to prevent that happening prior to reaching the normal takeoff distance.\n\n Here:\n http://img103.imageshack.us/img103/3953/graphlg0.gif\n This graph shows ground/air speed against time. The green graph is the plane taking off normally. The red graph is the plane under drag. V is the takeoff speed. The takeoff distance in both cases is the integral of velocity over time, or in other words the triangular area under each graph. Note that at any given instant the 'red' plane is both travelling slower and has travelled less distance than the 'green' plane. However, the distance travelled at the point of takeoff - the area under the red graph - is bigger than the area under the green graph.\n \n In reality the graphs wouldn't be nice and linear like that - but it doesn't matter, so long as we assume that the acceleration of the red plane (the slope of the red graph) can never exceed the acceleration of the green plane (the slope of the green graph) at any given velocity. As we've agreed, this is a reasonable assumption to make.\n \n The only way the red plane could take off in a shorter distance yet take longer is if it moved very slowly at first and then accelerated harder and faster than the green plane right at the end. But that can't happen. Ergo, the red plane will always move a greater distance before takeoff than the green plane.\n \n You've already agreed that a slower-accelerating plane takes a greater distance to get into the air.

   "Here's another graph to (hopefully) make it clearer:\n http://img520.imageshack.us/img520/8147/graph2uh9.gif\n What I've done here is shifted the graphs so that all takeoff times are at T=0. The green line is the velocity/time graph of the plane on a normal runway. The red line is the velocity/time graph of the plane on the tarp. The difference between the two now indicates how much extra time it takes for the red plane to reach the same ground/air speed as the green plane. As before, the areas under each graph represent the total distance travelled prior to takeoff. Clearly, the red plane travels further.\n \n The blue line represents the impossible: a plane subject to drag that takes as long as the red plane to get into the air but does so in a shorter distance than the green plane. The bolded section of the blue line is the impossible part: here the blue plane accelerates faster than the green plane at the same velocity.\n \n Proof that the plane on the tarp must travel further:\n \n 1. Plane A, under drag, is assumed to accelerate more slowly than plane B at any given velocity.\n \n 2. Plane A and plane B are both assumed to reach takeoff velocity V at the same instant, T = 0, having started their takeoff run at different times in the past.\n \n 3. For (1) and (2) to both be true, just prior to T = 0 plane A must have been travelling faster than plane B.\n \n No, I haven't got that backwards: between T = -0.1 and T = 0 plane A was accelerating more slowly than plane B, so for them both to reach the same speed at the same time plane A must already have been going quicker. Look at the graphs above: in order to reach V at T = 0, the slower-accelerating red plane must be going faster than the green plane just prior to T = 0.\n \n 4. Since plane A's average speed was higher over that small period, it travelled further in the same time.\n \n 5. Now consider the preceding period of time T = -0.2 to T = -0.1. Since we know by (3) plane A was travelling faster than plane B at T = -0.1, and A accelerates slower than B, it must logically have been already travelling faster than B at time T = -0.2.\n \n 6. Thus plane A's average speed was higher over this period also, and hence it must have travelled further.\n \n 7. By induction we can repeat 5 and 6 all the way back to the point when plane B started its takeoff.\n \n 8. Therefore, during the period of time B spent taking off, plane A travelled further.\n \n 9. To that total we add the extra distance travelled by A in the time prior to B starting to move. \n \n QED.",

   "That's very impressive. You evidently approached this in a scientific, albeit broad-brush manner. I'm am surprised you did not fully understand that I was approaching my conclusions based on what actually might happen in the real world rather than some comparison of your verbal descriptions of simplistic, unquantified happenings that I contend are somewhat unrealistic though they may logically back you up.\n \n Reducing engine thrust is not a valid comparison of experiments. It is patently obvious that doing so would increase the distance to lift off, all other things being equal.\n \n The fact that the reverse motion of the runway under the wheels should retard the plane's forward motion against equal engine thrust is what's being observed. The original question of whether the plane could take off while the runway went speeding backwards (I think originally, the runway or belt was already moving backwards at 30 mph when take off was initiated.)came with the tacet understanding that all other things are equal. It is quite simple to conclude that reducing the engine thrust would cause a longer path to lift off. It is not so obvious that the plane on the treadmill would require more distance (from the starting point). That it would take more time is easy to see. That it would be behind the unrestrained plane at any given time after T=0 is also obvious. What is not obvious is that the retarded plane cannot reach take off speed prior to reaching the take off point of the unrestrained plane.\n \n In your explanations, you use terms such as traveled further, speed was higher, accelerate more slowly and exaggerated the differences in your graphs.\n \n \n A true test would be to compare two identical planes starting side by side with their tails tethered to to the earth. Under one plane, the runway is already being moved at 30mph backwards. Under the other is a matching stationary runway. At T=0, the tethers are released and the race is on. Assuming identical planes under identical engine thrust, when plane A (the one on your left) reaches lift off speed...that is 30mph relative to the ground...plane B on your right may be at 29.99mph (relative to the ground) in a position several feet BEHIND the spot at which plane A lifted off. It may exceed 30mph prior to reaching the same spot. Therefore, though it lifted off in more time, it did so in a shorter distance.\n \n \n \n \n \nNo, it isn't; it's basic physics.\n \n Yes, at any given time the plane will be a) moving slower and b) have travelled less distance than it would if taking off normally. But it will only take off when it reaches takeoff speed, which will happen later.\nThere's been no argument with that. It will definitely take more time for the plane to lift off.\n \n \n \nSo what? Doesn't mean it's impossible or an invalid simulation of the effect.\nThe reduction of engine thrust is a totally different comparison.\n \n \nAnd nor has the plane :)\n \n You said that the plane will leave the ground closer to its starting point as a result of having been slowed down by the tarp. If the take off time was fixed, you'd be right, but it's the takeoff speed that's invariant.\nYes. For identical conditions, the takeoff speed is invariant.\n \n \n \n\n That's not what you said before, and it's still wrong anyway: the takeoff distance must increase.\nYou're right. It's not exactly what I said before. As I refine my thoughts, I see different things. I first stated that the takeoff distance would be decreased. I can now imagine it being decreased, the same or increased, depending of the wheel friction and the speed of the belt. After clarifying the original challenge (the plane is sitting on a treadmill that is already running 30mph backwards), I still contend that the takeoff distance can vary from less than to greater than that of an unrestrained identical plane.\n \n \n \n\n No, I'm not. I've explicitly said several times that at any given time the distance travelled will be less. But take-off doesn't happen at a given time, it happens at a given speed.\nI have not argued against that.\n \n \n \n\n I completely agree, and have said so numerous times now. What you're wrong about is the distance travelled at the point of takeoff.\nI am relating the distances of travel for each plane to the same point. The treadmill plane will not have traveled as far as the unrestrained plane at any given time prior to lift off of the unrestrained plane. The point at which its wheels last touch the ground will be a measureable distance ahead of where the treadmill plane is still struggling. The time it takes for the treadmill plane to reach the same distance from the GO mark could be sufficient time for the treadmill plane to reach lift off speed and be airborn prior to reaching that point...could it not?",

According to the definition you seem to be using it would be quite possible to have a negative takeoff distance, which would make no sense at all.\nYou have almost seen the light. The take off distance is the measurement from where the planes started to the point at which their wheels left the ground. Since I stipulated that in a fair test of identical planes operating under the conditions you mentioned in the OP, both planes (with identical aerodynamics and thrust) were tethered and applying full forward thrust when released at the same time as the ground moved 30 mph backwards under one of them, there is no doubt that neither plane would have moved backwards. Had the plane on the moving runway moved backwards at all, it would mean that full thrust is not enough to overcome the rearward force applied to the landing gear through the wheel friction. That plane would never take off.\n \n When comparing the takeoff distances of the planes, the distance from the staring point at T=0 is measured. By your way of measuring, a quarterback that drops back 15 yards then runs to a point five yards beyond scrimmage has made a 20 yard run.

At least, not in this scenario. Sure, under normal circumstances that would be one way to look at how it would be measured, but normal circumstances don't include a plane backing up before takeoff. The purpose of the \"takeoff distance\" measurment is to tell you how much runway you need. If the plane backed up 50 feet, then took off in 50 feet, the answer to that question, by your method, would be zero. The plane doesn't need any runway at all, it's become a helicopter. The actual answer, of course, is that the plane needs 50 feet of runway to take off, its takeoff distance is 50 feet; that doesn't change just because you dragged the plane back 10 feet or 50 feet or 100 miles. The takeoff distance of a plane is strictly a factor of the plane itself, the wind, and the interaction of the wheels with the ground. For a given runway and wind the takeoff distance is a constant for a given plane, just like its length or stall speed.

I have been flown into and out of many a tight spot in an air jalopy and often wondered if we would clear the treetops. \n \n Of course the original OP question is whether the plane would be able to accomplish takeoff. I think we both knew it would. Knowing that it is possible to make a STOL plane lift prior to its published takeoff speed, and that the landing speed with full flaps can be less than the takeoff speed, I had difficulty in mentally comparing two separate attempts in a real airplane with a real pilot. There are too many pilot controlled variables to make a reliable comparison of two actual sequential takeoffs by even the same pilot in the same plane with the same wind conditions. The simultaneous attempts of the two identical, pilotless planes with their tethered release and your clear explanations of the dynamics have convinced me that under identical conditions, the treadmill plane would always require more distance from the starting point to become airborne. It would be hard to prove with the little yellow plane, the truck and the tarp trick.\n \n I have seen STOL pilots rock the airplane nose up and down on roll out, move the stick at the right time and shorten the takeoff distance by several feet. I have seen them delay setting of the flaps for takeoff thereby reducing drag during the run up to takeoff speed. I have seen Pitts Specials fly across an airfield at a low altitude with a ground speed of less than five miles per hour in calm air, using mostly vertical and very little horizontal thrust. Theoretically, if you stand that plane on its tail and apply full thrust, it will takeoff vertically making the takeoff distance zero feet. I have also seen them fly somewhat controllably moving backwards. Aerobatic craft often appear to defy the principles of flight. For a while, it was thought that a shaped wing would not allow a plane to fly upside down and level...happens all the time.\n \n I enjoyed the discussion.\n \n Isly",
