Although I have felt this way myself for years, even growing up as a young boy I felt that we are all being conditioned for things conciously and unconsiously, that are out of our controll sometimes, I call it Conditioned slavery (but that is another can of worms...) and that their are Evils at work in this world.....in this country..... in this very Government of ours that are out for themselves and their \"agenda\" for power, money, and controll.

Bush was on camera in an elementary school in Sarasota, Fla. He could see the pagers of reporters and photographers going off, one by one. He was on the spot like few people have ever been.\n \n From two different angles, Americans have new glimpses of that historic moment. One comes from rabble-rousing Michael Moore, whose Bush-eviscerating film \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" premieres next week, and includes an uninterrupted seven-minute segment showing Bush's reaction after hearing the news of the attack. He doesn't move.\n \n Instead he continues to sit in the classroom, listening to children read aloud. Moore lets the tape roll as the minutes pass painfully by. \n\n washingtonpost.com: On 9/11, a Telling Seven-Minute Silence\n \n YouTube - Seven Minutes - The Bush 9/11 Split Screen Video",

At the time, 1996, he had committed no crime against America so I did not bring him here because we had no basis on which to hold him, though we knew he wanted to commit crimes against America. \n \n \"So I pleaded with the Saudis to take him, 'cause they could have.

Look at the historical American support for him.\n Quite frankly, America needs to learn a lesson about how our involvement in the Middle East backfires.\n\n Things can and do change. America's chief enemy #1 was the USSR, we were fighting the Cold War. Some people seem to think that the cold war was not a shooting war, and they would be flat wrong. Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq / Iran; it was all part of the US vs. the USSR. Sure, we propped up some people who we would later have to deal with, but we certainly defeated the far greater immediate threat. I would much rather face Saddam and Bin Laden now than have faced Khrushchev, Brezhnev, Andropov, or Chernenko in a nuclear standoff. We tried that once in '62, and I doubt many on this forum actually understand how close we came to WWIII and nuclear holocaust. \n \n \nIf you look at CURRENT DAY IRAQ, it's already a situation that reeks of future problems. They are already starting to rewrite their history. They loudly proclaim they don't owe America anything and they want us off their land. After spending a couple trillion (maybe more) on Iraq, they think they did it by themselves and that WE are the interlopers...\n\n That I do not doubt, in fact, I think it makes sense. After all, they have to save face in front of their Muslim neighbors. Add to that, when the US does leave, Iraq will now look like a wounded cat surrounded by a pack of wild dogs. The country is essentially torn apart by civil war and sectarian violence, has a weak military that is probably not capable of defending an igloo in a snowball fight, and the still holds some of the richest oil fields in the world. I can see Iran drooling already.",

As I said, we certainly created some of our own monsters to deal with. The problem that I have is far too few people realize that it wasn't simply the matter of supporting the mujahidin that did it. A lot of factors, some within our control, and many out of our control brought Bin Laden to the forefront. \n \n \nRussia was falling anyways, regardless of our U.S. efforts in Afghanistan. The problems that Russia had was present in its system, completely unrelated to Afghanistan.\n\n Which in my opinion made Russia even more of a danger to the west. I firmly believe that we were right to support their opposition at the time, even given the consequences. Sometimes the enemy of your enemy has to be your friend, even if he will become your enemy later.\n \n \nIran and Iraq have already started talking to each other, WITHOUT the U.S. present.\n But I guess it's really generous of us to destabilize Iran's neighbors for Iran.\n\n Generous indeed. Iran could run over Iraq in a matter or weeks, and it is doubtful if the US has the stomach for that kind of fight. A better question would be, given that Iraq wants us gone, should we come to their aid if such should come to pass. A nuclear armed Iran holding a huge majority of the world's oil could hold us over a barrel (pun intended).",

Nobody in the Osama administration is doing anything about our border, but I'm not screaming about how incompetant any of them are.\n\n Yeah. There you go again with the \"Osama\" remark... Consistent, aintcha?\n \n But on target, the point is that Bush was informed of the existence of an attack on the U.S., and he JUST SAT THERE.\n Do you think somebody came in to tell Roosevelt about the attack, and he just sat there wanting to finish his book on \"My Three Billygoats\" first?\n No. He probably stopped what he was doing and got FURTHER INFORMATION.\n \n Imagine for a second that somebody had gotten control of Russian nukes and had launched one at the U.S.\n The U.S. sees it, and rushes to inform the president.\n The president sits there for seven minutes DOING NOTHING.\n The point is that he sat there with NO information other than the United States was under attack, and he chose to DO NOTHING during a time-frame that he had no clue as to whether or not his leadership was needed.\n \n \n \nFoundit, never address any president as \"Mr. President.\"\nThe irony of that accusation.\n Everybody? Look above at Ethmi repeatedly naming presidents IN THE SAME FASHION that I have been doing.\n \n \n \nFoundit, never address any president as \"Mr. President.\" Address them as \"Mr. Scapegoat\".\n\n This isn't even a \"Scapegoat\" issue. I am not saying that he CAUSED anything by his failure of that seven minutes.\n The point is that it points to a THOROUGH LACK OF CAPABILITY to respond.\n Suppose a man got a phone call from his wife saying \"Our house is under attack\".\n The man does nothing for seven minutes.\n What would you think of such a guy?\n \n \n \nIt doesn't matter if it was seven minutes or seven seconds, I'd still be hearing these comments.\n\n That is one of the lamest excuses I have ever seen.\n First of all, NO. You wouldn't.\n Second of all, it doesn't even address the VALIDITY of the observation.\n \n \n \nThere you have it. But I don't see why you should change the subject immediatly after answering.\n\n My gawd this is amusing.\n I have a specific reason for thinking the president performed poorly in that circumstance. (That's putting it mildly)\n You throw out a WRONG GUESS as to why a person could think \"poor performance\" and ask if you are right.\n I reply that you aren't, and then I PROCEED TO EXPLAIN WHY I think he did poorly.\n \n You don't want to hear my REAL reason.\n You can't RESPOND to my real reason.\n So you ignore it.\n \n \n \nI'm not expecting anyone to agree with this, but sunshine and rainbows won't give Katie Couric her paycheck. I will be surprised if anyone agrees with that, but I will be equally surprised if anyone denies that the media will be biased if it helps to serve its own agenda (ie, the almighty dollar).\n\n This is another non-response.\n Our economy is in the outhouse.\n The media's bias HAS NOTHING to do with that.\n \n If you have the capability (but you don't) to argue the actual status of the economy, then do so.\n If you want to put out mindless gripes that have NOTHING to do with the point made, then you're doing fine (at least in your own mind)\n \n \n \nAnd I really expect Obama's shopping spree to lower gas prices.\n\n Did somebody say it would?\n Or is this just another pointless off the cuff subject change from you?\n \n The point is that GEORGE BUSH doesn't know what's going on.\n Quit trying to change the subject to \"Obama\".\n \n \n \nDon't even go down that road.
