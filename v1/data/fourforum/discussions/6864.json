You won't see him making appearances on their behalf unless the state is a locked-in landslide. With his poll ratings, Scooter's blunder and Iraq fresh in everyone's minds, he's more of a political liability than asset.

   "http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/cheney_doc.html\n \n \nWhen news of George W. Bush's drunken driving arrest surfaced during the final week of the 2000 presidential campaign, Republicans tried to dismiss it as one of those \"youthful indiscretions\" Bush had steadfastly refused to discuss. Of course, when he got popped in Kennebunkport in 1976, Bush was 30 years old, hardly a kid. \n \n Vice President Dick Cheney, on the other hand, could actually argue that his two DWIs came when he was young and reckless. \n \n Court and police records obtained by The Smoking Gun show that Cheney was convicted of drunk driving twice during an eight-month period in the early 1960s in his home state of Wyoming. The two convictions came when Cheney was 21 and 22 and resulted in fines and a brief suspension of his driver's license. \n \n On November 2, in the wake of the Bush DWI discovery, a Cheney spokesperson told reporters that the vice presidential candidate also had a rap sheet. But the Bush-Cheney campaign refused to provide any further details about the DWI busts. So TSG will now handle that chore. \n \n Cheney first privately disclosed the arrests in 1989, after he had been nominated for Secretary of Defense. According to an account in Bob Woodward's \"The Commanders,\" Cheney told members of the Senate Armed Services committee about the DWI arrests during a closed confirmation hearing. Cheney told the senators that he believed it would be best to publicly disclose the busts. But Armed Services committee members said there was no need for the disclosure and subsequently confirmed Cheney in a 20-0 vote. \n \n Following the May 1991 publication of Woodward's book, there was no mention of Cheney's arrests until the brief confirmation offered by the candidate's spokesperson last November. But the vice president himself mentioned his rap sheet in an interview in the current issue (dated May 7) of The New Yorker. Cheney noted that after dropping out of Yale in early 1961, he found himself \"working, building power lines, having been in a couple of scrapes with the law.\" The busts, he said, made him \"think about where I was and where I was headed. I was headed down a bad road, if I continued on that course.\" \n \n Cheney's first DWI conviction came in November 1962 when he was 21. According to this docket from Cheyenne's Municipal Court, Cheney was nailed for drunkenness and \"operating motor vehicle while intoxicated.\" A Cheyenne Police Judge found Cheney guilty of the two charges and hit him with a 30-day suspension of his driver's license. Cheney also had to forfeit a $150 bond posted at the time of his arrest. Further information about the case--such as the defendant's blood alcohol content or whether Cheney was jailed following the bust--is unavailable since other court records from that period have been destroyed, according to Wyoming officials. \n \n Details of Cheney's second Wyoming arrest, in July 1963, have also fallen victim to time and records destruction practices at the local Municipal Court. But a police arrest card (similar to the one that haunted Dubya) maintained by the Rock Springs Police Department shows that Cheney was fined $100 for his second DWI conviction. The card lists the charge against Cheney, who was then working as a groundman laying power lines, as \"11-44,\" the criminal code classification for drunken driving, according to Police Chief Neil Kourbelas. At the time of the Rock Springs arrest, Kourbelas said that local cops and judges would not have known that young Cheney was a boozing 'n driving recidivist. The police department, Kourbelas said, \"wouldn't have had the ability to automatically check with other jurisdictions to find out if anyone had had prior arrests or convictions. We could have arrested Jack the Ripper back then and had no idea what he had done.\" \n \n Since that second Wyoming arrest, Cheney has kept his nose clean.\n\n Cheney also dropped out of Yale University, couldn't hack it there.",

   "http://www.rense.com/general52/chenn.htm\n \n \nIt is apparent from the piece that Richard Cheney did everything humanly possible -- short of fleeing to Canada -- to avoid military conscription: He applied for and recieved 5 student deferments, a number described as \"incredible\" by professor David Curry of the University of Missouri in St. Louis. Curry has written extensively about the draft, including a 1985 book, \"Sunshine Patriots: Punishment and the Vietnam Offender.\" The Times quotes Mr. Curry as observing: \"That's a lot of times for the draft board to say O.K.\" \n \n * Three weeks and a day after the Gulf of Tonkin resolution passed (giving President Johnson unlimited military force in Vietnam), Cheney married Lynn Cheney. \n \n * Within a day or so of the end of deferment for \"Married w/o children,\" Mr. and Mrs. Cheney conceived their first child. \n \n Here's the rest of Cheney's well timed actions: \n \n In February 1962, when Mr. Cheney was classified as 1-A available for service he was doing poorly at Yale. But the military was taking only older men at that point, and like others who were in college at the time, Mr. Cheney seemed to have little concern about being drafted. \n \n In June, he left Yale. After returning home to Casper, a small city in east-central Wyoming, he worked as a lineman for a power company. \n \n At that point, the Vietnam War was still just a glimmer on the horizon. In 1962, only 82,060 men were inducted into the service, the fewest since 1949. Mr. Cheney was eligible for the draft but, as he said during his confirmation hearings in 1989, he was not called up because the Selective Service System was taking only older men. \n \n But by 1963, ferment in Vietnam was rising. Mr. Cheney enrolled in Casper Community College in January 1963 he turned 22 that month and sought his first student deferment on March 20, according to records from the Selective Service System. After transferring to the University of Wyoming at Laramie, he sought his second student deferment on July 23, 1963. \n \n On Aug. 7, 1964, Congress approved the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, which allowed President Lyndon B. Johnson to use unlimited military force in Vietnam. The war escalated rapidly from there. \n \n Just 22 days later, Mr. Cheney married his high school sweetheart, Lynne. He sought his third student deferment on Oct. 14, 1964. \n \n In May 1965, Mr. Cheney graduated from college and his draft status changed to 1-A. But he was married, which offered him some protection. \n \n In July, President Johnson announced that he was doubling the number of men drafted. The number of inductions soared, to 382,010 in 1966 from 230,991 in 1965 and 112,386 in 1964. \n \n Mr. Cheney obtained his fourth deferment when he started graduate school at the University of Wyoming on Nov. 1, 1965. \n \n On Oct. 6, 1965, the Selective Service lifted its ban against drafting married men who had no children. Nine months and two days later, Mr. Cheney's first daughter, Elizabeth, was born. On Jan. 19, 1966, when his wife was about 10 weeks pregnant, Mr. Cheney applied for 3-A status, the \"hardship\" exemption, which excluded men with children or dependent parents. It was granted. \n \n In January 1967, Mr. Cheney turned 26 and was no longer eligible for the draft.\n",

   "The point here is that it's silly to take one memo, from an outside source, that's heresay, could have been forged, and make an entire judgement of the situation based on that, without taking into account other evidence from bipartisan investigations. pretending what they say wasn't said. You guys are letting the Downing St. Memo trump everything else in your mind, because you want it to trump them. It says something you want it to say. It's quite obvious.\n\n \n Unfortunatly, the Bush admionistration has classified more materials than any presidency in history. This means that there is essentially zero chance of getting any kind of realistic assesment of that (or any other) sotuation from publicly available materials. \n \n The simple fact fo the matter is, the downing memo has been authenticated, it is from a highly reliable source, and it fits the fact FAR, FAR better than any other explanation to date.\n \n The Bush admin lied and fixed the intel. They have still not been willing to publicly address the downing street memo. We were seeing reports int he leadup to war from CIA analysts who claimed they were being pressured to cook the intel. When it came time for these guys to testify, not a single one of them was allowed. Instead people were hand picked to testify, most of whome testified that they had no direct involvement, but that they did not know of any external pressure being applied (which, since they were not involved, would certainly make sense).",

But he shouldn't have to apologize for something he didn't do.\n\n \n So why did he go with that intelligence when they had more reliable intelligence that said there wasn't?

Saddam could have offered himself hostage while Iraq was searched for WMDs and it wouldn't have changed a thing. Administration preferred listening to White House 'intelligence' gleaned from expatriate Iraqis with self-serving interests that coincided with administration desires.

   "Here's an excerpt from a book by Scott Ritter, former UN Weapons Inspector involved in Iraq weapons inspection prior to the US invasion of Iraq:\n \n ~The bottom line is by 1995 there were no more weapons in Iraq, there were no more documents in Iraq, there was no more production capability in Iraq because we were monitoring the totality of Iraq's industrial infrastructure with the most technologically advanced, the most intrusive arms control regime in the history of arms control. \n \n And furthermore, the CIA knew this, the British intelligence knew this, Israeli intelligence knew this, German intelligence, the whole world knew this. They weren't going to say that Iraq was disarmed because nobody could say that, but they definitely knew that the Iraqi capability regarding WMD had been reduced to as near to zero as you could bring it, and that Iraq represented a threat to no one when it came to weapons of mass destruction.~ \n \n No copyright infringement as this and other excepts were related to reporter Seymour Hersh by Ritter in a public meeting on 26-10-05. For Hersh's credentials; he's the reporter who received a Pulitzer Prize for uncovering and reporting the Mei Lai massacre in Vietnam. He also broke the story on mistreatment of Iraqi detainees by US forces at Abu Ghraib Prison. \n \n There are literally endless, factual stories on how world intelligence agencies were aware of Iraq's inability to threaten anyone with WMDs after the middle 1990s. Why some Americans cling to the deception of WMD intelligence fostered by US administration is testimony to their gullibility and conceit. And to those blind Americans who also believe congress shared the full realm of intelligence held by administration, get the pixie dust out of your eyes and do some research before repeating talking head reports prepared and distributed by administration. You might learn something.",
