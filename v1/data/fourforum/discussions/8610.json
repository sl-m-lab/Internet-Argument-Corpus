   "There is a good  God and a bad God. The good God is Christ's Father. He is the God of Liberty that Jeremiah speaks about. He rewards good people for doing good things. Then, there is the bad God. He is Lucifer prince of the earth. He punishes bad people for doing bad things.\n \n Our good God is like us. If we give the key to the police to lock up bad people for doing bad things, then the good God gives the key to the bad God to lock up the bad people for doing bad things.\n \n Jesus forewarned us of how the good God works. Maybe, we didnt' understand what he meant at the time. Let me refresh your memory.\n \n Matt16 [19]  And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\n \n I take the word of the good God. What's so good about the good God is he takes our word too. He even allows the words of our own mouth to either justify or condemn us.\n \n Matt12 [37] For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.\n \n No matter how important anyone may imagine he or she is, it is impossible to get around the system of our good God. He has it all worked out perfectly until the very end.\n \n Another thing is that the good God looks down on bad people that hate their own brother. In fact, in his eyes it's the same as being a murderer. The good God forbids the bad people from having eternal life in heaven.\n \n 1John3 [15] Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.\n \n I serve the good God. Find out which God you serve. It will determine if your name is blotted from the Lamb's Book of Life.\n \n Amen!",

   " The good God forbids the bad people from having eternal life in heaven.\n\n \n \nno one is good except your father in heaven\n\n \n \nAll have turned away, they have together become worthless; there is no one who does good, not even one.\" \n\n \n Jesus the Son of God told us to love our enemies and pray for those who persecute us.\n \n he layed down his life for his friends and also for his enemies and squred it with his heavenly father so that even those who unbeknown to them do wicked things can still have eternal life and those who know and repent he will forgive.\n \n \n\"forgive them father for they know not what they do\" \n\n \n \nBut the other criminal rebuked him. \"Don't you fear God,\" he said, \"since you are under the same sentence? 41 We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong.\" 42 Then he repented, \"Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.\" 43 Jesus answered him, \"I tell you the truth, today you will be with me in paradise.\" \n\n \n man can not attain justification to enter eternal life, it is by the justification of only one man that all men are saved\n \n \nThis righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe.\n\n \n Christ defeted sin and raised the whole of mankind from damnation and heaven awaits for anyone willing to accept it.\n \n \nwe have put our hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, and especially of those who believe. \n\n \n God led the whole of isreal out of egypt not one isrealite was left in the bondage of egypt, Christ has freed the whole of mankind from the bondage of sin, he is the saviour of the world, he has conqured sin and we are partners in that conquest, the isrealites were led to the promised land by the hand of god but remember those who choose their own path never saw the promised land.",
