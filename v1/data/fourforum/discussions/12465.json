   "NASHVILLE, Tenn. - One state lawmaker does not want homosexuality brought up at all in schools.\n \n Rep. Stacey Campfield said he believes the issue of homosexuality can be too complicated for young minds to understand. Campfield filed, the \"Don't Say Gay\" bill, which would essentially ban teachers from talking about the topic.\n \n \"I think our teachers need to stick with reading, writing, and arithmetic,\" Campfield said. \"It confuses a lot of children that are already in a difficult part of life, and it's a very complex issue.\"\n \n Campfield pointed to newspaper articles as examples of where homosexuality was being taught in schools, like a program in Knoxville that contains information on aids, gay and lesbian sex. He said second graders had access to the information.\n \n \"Let's take this off the table, lets not talk about this to very young children, I don't see a problem with that,\" Campfield said.\n \n \"I don't think its being taught as curriculum,\" said Chris Sanders with the Tennessee Equality Project.\n \n Sanders said Campfield does not have enough proof that the issue is real, and calls the bill homophobic.\n \n \"If you can't mention something, that sends a signal that there is something wrong with it,\" Sanders said.NewsChannel 5.com - Nashville, Tennessee - Legislation Aims to Ban 'Gay' From School\n Education should be age appropriate, but EQUIVALENT.\n \n If kids in second grade are able to see books that talk about Prince Charming and Snow White living happily ever after, then allowing them material about Prince Charming and Bill White living happily ever after is not teaching them about sex.\n And you'll note how this is phrased. \"Had access to\".\n Not \"the teachers were teaching them as part of the lesson plan\"...\n \n But going further, this legislation goes wayyy beyond the typical retort of trying to label \"John and Bill\" as age inappropriate, while \"John and Mary\" is something nobody thinks twice at.\n This bill would affect eighth graders who are not second graders, by preventing the teachers from raising the issue.\n \n It's another attempt to marginalize gays by ignoring them. The real issues go unaddressed, and REAL education is withheld.\n This is part of the problem for why we still have people who can't realize that being gay is not a choice. The fact that it is 2009 and we still have \"discussions\" on that should be embarrassing.\n \n The real issue is that people who are against gays and want to keep us quiet KNOW that they can't justify their position without insisting that people have to believe in the bible. Other justification attempts are contradictory or just fall flat in the modern age.",

Now there are two of you...\n < end sarcasm <\n Reviewing the web-site, I found this interesting tidbit... \"Saying that people can choose to become ##### does not necessarily imply that people can also choose to become heterosexual.\"\n Quite frankly, such a statement essentially revokes any claim to being able to \"choose\" in the first place.\n \n It's like saying \"I can choose to walk or fly, but I choose to walk.\"\n \"Okay. So you're saying you could fly if you wanted to.\"\n \"Not necessarily...\"\n \n Here's another one...\n Question: \"Do you mean you can just look at someone and decide whether to be attracted to them?\"\n Answer: \"That's not exactly the kind of choice we mean. ....\"\n That's kind of the point of claiming you can CHOOSE sexual ATTRACTION.\n One of the other attempts on this front is to REDEFINE what one means by \"sexual orientation\" into a nebulous and pointless interpretation that ignores what OTHER people mean when they say \"sexual orientation is not chosen\".\n It's like having John say \"The horse is black\".\n Mark comes along and says \"The horse is red\", but he's not really talking about the \"horse\" that John was talking about.\n \n Furthermore, I think we've already explored the issue of \"bisexuals\" who truly do have A potential to \"choose\", but NOT to really choose their \"sexual orientation\". They could suppress their desire for one, but that doesn't mean much. It's like a person who likes BOTH chocolate and strawberry, deciding to choose only chocolate, but the fact that the person LIKES BOTH still exists.\n \n \n \nExcept I've provided you with several links, like the one above, to groups of people who claim to have chosen their sexual orientation, so claiming I'm the only person you have ever seen that claims this is either a lie or willful ignorance.\n\n The \"one above\" is not a \"group\".\n I really don't remember you showing me ANY such \"several links\". I remember CHALLENGING you to show me the proof of a possibility of \"choice\", but then you tossed of a claim of \"I've already proven it\"...\n If you have those links, go ahead and show them.\n \n Reading through other spots on the web-site, I see the usual junk that screams of a person who was typically IN DENIAL of their sexual orientation, assuming they were one way before eventually choosing to ACKNOWLEDGE their sexual orientation.\n There is a huge difference inbetween coming to terms with who you ARE, and CHOOSING to be something.\n \n Also, another factor (as mentioned before) is bisexuality. There have been a variety of studies to demonstrate that women's sexuality is more nebulous and they are more capable of \"bisexual\" behavior.\n I look at several of those quotes on the web-site and see precisely that as well...\n \n And amusingly enough, some of those quotes have absolutely no claim to being representative of a \"choosing to be gay\" at all.\n \n \n \nOn the other hand if I or anyone else can accept your challenge then you have proven choice is a factor. I refer you back to the links I have already given you.\n\n And I am addressing those links.\n At any rate, it would be fascinating to see such an experiment play out in real life.\n \n \n \nAs I've said numerous times, I don't know what determines sexual orientation. I suspect its a combination of things, I know free will (choice) is a factor for some but quite possibly not a factor for others. I also suspect there are environmental factors for some. It's not strictly geneticly determined but their may well be a genetic predisposition that makes one orientation or the other more likely.\n\n The scientific consensus is that it is not \"strictly genetic\", but genetics ARE involved as demonstrated by a variety of genetic studies.\n There is also a realization that choice is not an aspect of the situation.\n \n \n \nI find it interesting that people who say choice isn't a factor present the exact same argument as people who say it is.\n\n I have no idea what you think you mean.\n \n \n \nI also find it the height of arrogance for people to claim that because they feel it wasn't a choice for them it couldn't have been a choice for someone else.\n\n As I have said, I am working off of experience.\n So far, you are the first poster I have EVER come across that has claimed it was a \"choice\" for you.\n I have given you a LONG LIST of reasons to show why it is NOT a choice. For one, if sexual orientation were a choice, there would be no need for \"reparative therapy\". People could just \"change\" at will.\n But as the review of the \"reparative therapy\" has shown, at best they can SUPPRESS sexual orientation in some, but not create sustaining and independent (without perpetual feedback like those who go into the reparative therapy business themselves) attraction.\n \n Tell me. If you come across dozens of dozens upon dozens of people who did not choose to their sexual orientation, and then you come across an internet poster who claims to be able to choose, what would be your assessment?",

However, what Matt is pointing out is that even though it may not be a prime focus, it has always been there in stories, and history. Examples in lectures given to students etc.\n \n What is different is that we (being the gay community) feel that people should broaden the subject matter. To instill in growing minds that ignorance and not knowing about others can lead to intolerance and fear, or even anger of there fellow gay and lesbian peers.\n \n This in turn subjugates those growing minds who seek a positive learning environment, to bullying, harassment, and even physical threatening and action. To show others and enlighten them about those who are gay and lesbian, and to show we are a positive influence on society will hopefully stem alot of the bias and ignorance brought forth from simply not understanding.\n \n We are not asking for teachers to say being gay is \"ok\" or what have you. But rather to give an unbiased look at our plight and struggles in society and to bring to light that we are a part of society that won't go away, and that we are jist a part of the populace and need fair treatment just as our heterosexual peers do as well.",

It NEEDS to be brought out that Walt Whitman was homosexual because it's generally understood that it influenced his writing. No accurate and education teaching about Whitman would leave this out. This would be a course where a teacher would do well TO talk about it.\n \n Example B - Physics class.

   "This has come up in like 3-4 threads that I can remember and I just don't remember any class in high school where this would even matter.\n Below is a list of high school classes I remember taking (granted this was decades ago).\n \n Math\n Science\n Social Studies (aka History)\n English\n French\n Health/PE\n Accounting\n Typing\n Computer Science...on old computers ha\n Technical Drawing\n \n I'm sure there are some others but I can't remember. Anyway, from that list \"gay\" or \"straight\" would come up in none of those. At best it would come up in the 2 week session in Health related to sex ed but isn't that course more about STDs, safe sex practices, and risks? I suppose if you schools has a sociology class it might come up there but that is High School I think. \n Basically my point is that this is a lot about nothing.\n\n Change the issue from \"gay\" to \"religion\" or \"Christianity\", and see how many people still agree...\n \n I think the main problem is that the teacher is PREVENTED FROM TALKING about it in the first place.\n If a student were to ask a question about gays, an age appropriate answer would be forbidden.\n That's ridiculous!",

   "Change the issue from \"gay\" to \"religion\" or \"Christianity\", and see how many people still agree...\n For the sake of argument, in those listed classes I can find an example where that is relevant other than, again, sociology. Parts might be stated in the founding of our country in a history class. For example people who came over on the Mayflower and why they did so. This certainly shouldn't go into ideals. Likewise a history class dealing with social movements could probably include gay rights assuming more events happen that a big impact. \n \n \nI think the main problem is that the teacher is PREVENTED FROM TALKING about it in the first place.\n If a student were to ask a question about gays, an age appropriate answer would be forbidden.\n That's ridiculous!\nWell when would it come up I guess is my question. I think it is dumb to outright ban the term from being said in school...that seems dumb. If it comes up in a political science class I don't see what the big deal is either. What you don't want to get into is a morality teaching session in schools. This never helps any cause and only serves to divide people. I have a lot of friends who support forced prayer to God in schools. While I do believe God is the purpose for everything you gain nothing from forcing people this way and from my experience you drive people away from God and end up doing a disservice. This is why, instead, a moment of silence is fine or why you shouldn't stop a student from praying on his own.\n \n Now I do have my exceptions to this with things like school sporting events where a prayer is said. I frankly don't care if they wish to do this because sports aren't a big deal in life.",
