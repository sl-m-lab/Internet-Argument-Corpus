   "Saakashvili is showing himself as 'The Collector of Georgian lands' and using US support and power for it. Look, he directs all his movements for creation of strong Army and he is set to eliminate internal opposition fully. Moreover Georgian president actions have very hard character. It's well-know that he is going to solve problem of reunion with Abkhazia and South Ossetia by power methods only. Movements of Georgian officials with regards to opposition we watched not long ago - 30 representatives of opposition were arrested and accused in preparation for coup d'etat.\n Well, to tell the truth all it pushed me to idea that Saakashvili used USA for his own problems solving. I think that Georgian president movements direct to creation of monarchic regime. He wishes to bring together all Georgian lands and annihilate opposition and in future he will create the ground for monarchy and will realize his own political line independent of USA. As a result of it we will lose control over so important district. We have to do something with Saakashvili and his ambitions.",
