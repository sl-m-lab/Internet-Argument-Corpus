   "Below is a \"fund-raiser\" notice from an \"ex-gay\" group to the public, trying to inspire them to send the ex-gay group money for their work...\n \n As of last year, we had almost 15,000 people on our postal and e-mail lists... many whom have supported this ministry in one way, shape or form within the last eight years. Yet last year, less than 1% (THAT'S ONE PERCENT) of SBM's support base supported this ministry financially. \n \n That my friends, is heartbreaking and sad.\n \n Believe me, this is NOT a \"pity post\". It's the honest truth. When churches and Christians close their doors and instead open them to those who \"tickle their ears\" with health, wealth, prosperity and entertainment instead of the truth that can set many of their members or member's families free, we know biblical prophecy is being fulfilled.\n \n ....\n There have been months we have gone without -- unable to pay simple necessities such as the ministry bills, the mortgage, electric, salaries, and personally doctor's bills. The Lord doesn't want this. We are to be responsible with what He provides and we are. We are frugal with every dime this ministry receives. Yet, as I said, we are at a major crossroad now. We can no longer go on operating the way we have.\n \n ....\n I don't need to tell you this, but homosexuality is destroying this nation. Our children -- your children -- are getting trapped and deceived into a lifestyle that is NOW being promoted, celebrated and being marketed as \"natural and normal.\" Nothing could be further from God's truth.\n \n We have been here for you and for others now for the last eight years. MANY people have come to Christ -- those struggling with homosexuality, and even those who have not. Lives have been changed! Souls have been set free and the Kingdom of God has multiplied through the work of SBM. It is now time to say, \"Yes, I will gladly partner with SBM monthly because I want to be part of the solution!\"\n http://www.igroops.com/igroops/sbm/blog/VIEW+00000002\n \n This is a perfect example of how some of the anti-gay movement often demonizes gays, and thus these examples have blame for the problems they cause gays.\n It is not rationale to proclaim such bile against gays, proclaiming that they are responsible for \"destroying this nation\", and then pretend that such actions don't have an inherent consequence in that some people HEAR and ACCEPT the message, and then act upon it.\n Act upon it in a way that attacks gays, both in their rights and in their mental well-being.\n \n I wouldn't be surprised if he is having problems because his \"base\" is shrinking. Being anti-gay used to be a huge selling point, capable of scaring up voters for Republican support.\n Today, not so much so. These actions are becoming more and more transparent for those capable of reason to see them as a facade of irrational fear put on to play to prejudice.",
