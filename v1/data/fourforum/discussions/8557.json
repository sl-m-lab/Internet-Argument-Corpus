   "Everybody should know the mental health hidden facts, including how to prevent misdiagnosing. Since money is, the issue and insurance companies play a role in the treatment of mental health disorders.\n \n The only area of problems in mental health is that the patient will be receiving a series of diagnoses that conform to the standards laid out in health care coverage.\n \n For example, Jane goes to a counselor and explains her symptoms, as well as talks about the people around her that are contributing to the problem. She is trying to control her behavior but others are making it difficult since every single day they center her out, bringing forward the issues of her disorder. \n \n In this example we can see that others are the first problem, since many people will center out individuals defects first, before complimenting. Therefore, that problem can be resolved if we teach Jane how to handles other people around her. \n \n The next issue of consideration of is the symptoms. What mental health disorder symptoms do you have Jane? Jane says I am having nightmares, night sweats, impulsive outbursts, flashbacks, and so on. \n \n First, Jane is illustrating symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, so it is apparent that she is a trauma patient. As a result, Jane is certain she was victimized, but uncertain of the feelings, emotions, and thought process she is lasting. \n \n Now Jane may or may not be able to tell you the entire event that brought forth this disorder, but Jane can tell you the surroundings of the event. This means the counselor needs to invoke talk therapy to find out the underlying source of her suffering. The mind is a tricky thing, and to understand it, you must address it.\n \n Louies.",
