   "From here. \n \n \nBoy faces felony in baseball bat abortion\n Law won't allow Macomb teen girl to be charged in helping end her pregnancy.\n \n RICHMOND TOWNSHIP - Macomb County Prosecutor Eric Smith said his hands were tied when it came time to decide whom to charge in the baseball bat beating death of a fetus being carried by a teenage girl. \n \n He decided Tuesday to do the only thing one state statute allowed: charge the boyfriend who wielded the bat, hitting his girlfriend in the stomach repeatedly over a two-week period, but let the girl off the hook, uncharged. \n \n The Richmond Township boy, 16, who may be arraigned as early as today in Macomb County Juvenile Court, is at home with his parents. He was charged as a juvenile with intentional conduct against a pregnancy or stillbirth, which is a felony. If convicted, he could remain in custody until age 21. \n \n But the girl, also from Richmond - who was a willing participant in the induced abortion, law enforcement officials say - cannot be charged under that law because it specifically excludes the mother from criminal liability. \n \n In part because it still was legal to abort the fetus, the decision renewed debate over the protection of fetuses and the fairness of charging just one of two juveniles who allegedly agreed to kill their unborn child. \n \n Although Smith called the case \"shocking and reprehensible,\" he added, \"we are bound by the law. We don't have the option of charging (the girl).\" \n \n Smith said if the 6-month-old fetus had been viable, the boy would have been charged with manslaughter of a quick-born child, a 15-year felony. \n \n The girl could have then also received the same charge for aiding and abetting. \n \n Miranda Massie, a Detroit civil rights attorney, believes neither teen should be charged. \"My heart went out to these poor kids,\" Massie said. \"I believe it is a terrible mistake to be charged at all. This is a tremendous waste of public resources. \n \n \"What is Macomb County going to gain by criminal charges?\" \n \n She contacted the family of the boy to represent him. She believes that neither teen deserves to be charged. \n \n Smith charged the boy under a state law passed in 1999 - called the \"Prenatal Protection Act\" - that states only the person assaulting a pregnant woman resulting in a miscarriage is criminally liable. The pregnant woman, no matter how complicit in the termination, is not. \n \n If that provision had not been written into the statute, it would have clashed with the federal law that allows abortions under the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade U.S Supreme Court decision, said Pam Sherstad, spokeswoman for Right to Life of Michigan, which worked to pass the 1999 state law. \n \n \"Abortion is obviously legal in the United States,\" Sherstad said, \"and you can't have a state law that interferes with federal law. The Prenatal Protection Act was designed to protect pregnant women who are assaulted by someone resulting in the death of their unborn child. This is obviously a unique case.\" \n \n Legally, the baby could have been aborted. Because the girl was a minor, she would have needed a judge's or parental permission to obtain an abortion. \n \n Smith said he waited until final toxicology reports on the fetus were completed by the medical examiner to determine what charges could be brought against the 16-year-old boy. The prosecutor declined to identify the youth because because he is charged as a juvenile. \n \n Arthur Caplan, professor of medical ethics at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, believes the girl should be charged with planning, plotting or conspiring to murder. \n \n \"But it's tough to do, because the law takes a different view of developing potential life than it does of actual life,\" Caplan said. \"If the boy was charged with murder she probably would be facing charges, too. \n \n \"But being involved in causing a miscarriage is not as severe as murder,\" Caplan said. \"Ethically, you could argue that this seems wrong, but the law draws a sharp distinction between killing your child and a fetus that's not yet viable. That may strike some pro-life people and conservatives as wrong, but that's the way the law is now.\" \n \n Sherstad said the case illustrates how \"the sanctity of life is not valued in our culture. It's sad that human life can be discarded this way. There's no value on the life of an unborn child, which makes it easier for something like this to happen.\" \n \n Lori Lamerand, vice president of the Planned Parenthood Mid-Michigan Alliance, said pregnant teens have safer options available than terminating a pregnancy without a doctor. \n \n \"It's always tragic when people resort to such drastic measures, when there are appropriate, safe medical measures are available,\" Lamerand said. \n \n Both the boy and his girlfriend have returned to classes at Armada High School, said Arnold Kummerow, superintendent of Armada Area Schools. \n \n Law enforcement officials were first made aware of the incident in mid-November, when the girl spoke about the series of events that led to the miscarriage while at a high school leadership conference in the Upper Peninsula. The adult facilitator of the conference contacted the Michigan State Police. Detectives from the state police Richmond Post investigated the claim, and went to the boyfriend's home, where they found the buried fetus. \n \n An autopsy was consistent with initial reports from the Michigan State Police that the miscarriage was caused by the girl's boyfriend repeatedly striking her with a 22-inch souvenir baseball bat over a two-week period, Smith said. \n \n The parents of the teens were not aware of the pregnancy or the decision to abort it, investigators said. \n \n Police believe the fetus was aborted in early October, then buried in the back yard of the boyfriend's home with the help of his mother. \n \n The fetus died of premature birth associated with trauma to the mother, according to chief Macomb County Medical Examiner Dr. Daniel Spitz. \n \n The fetus could not have survived outside the womb at the time of miscarriage, he ruled. \n\n \n A couple more facts:\n \n \nThe girl estimated she was four months pregnant, said Macomb County Prosecutor-elect Eric Smith. Police said the boy's mother helped transport the fetus to her home and bury it in the backyard.\n ...\n Smith said the beatings were \"done over a period of three weeks. It was done in an effort to terminate the pregnancy.\"\n ...\n Under Michigan law, people under 18 need one parent's permission to obtain a legal abortion. A minor also can receive one with a judge's permission to bypass that requirement.\n ...\n A first-trimester abortion without complications costs about $300, Warren said.\n Warren said she hears anecdotal evidence of forced miscarriages but those come mostly from states that require both parents approval for an abortion.\n \"If 16-year-olds feel that this is there only option, than we have really missed the boat on educating them about sexual health,\" Warren said.\n\n \n Thoughts? \n \n I agree with PP... there is something seriously wrong if the girl would rather be hit in the stomache with an aluminum bat for three weeks rather than give birth or try and get a legal abortion.",

I am pretty sure that is the case here - and something like abuse has to be shown to keep the information from parents.\n\n \n \n Generally no emancipation is required. When you become emancipated, you essentially become a legal adult (your parents are no longer responsible for you, you are responsible for yourself). If that was the case, I would not have so much problem with this. As is, a parent is wholly responsible for the actions of their children, responsible for the care and feeding of said child, and responsible for providing for that childs welfare. In return, the parent essentially gets to make all major decisions for that child. That is essential to the job of parenting. You cannot parent if you don't have the authority to make decision that you feel are best for your child and then enforce them. \n \n If the courts want to take the responsibility of making decisions regarding such things, then they can also take the responsibility of raising that child to be a productive member of society and providing for their material needs. Given the fact that over 80% of children who grow up in \"the system\" end up criminals, I really have to question the wisdom of this.",

(Pssst! It's not something in the water!)\n\n \n I agree with you. I do not advocate women having irresponsible sex and I don't wish you to either. However, pregnancy should not be mandated by law simply to teach women to be responsible. Forced responsibility is not responsibility, and just because a child is more responsibility does not make it the responsible choice. It is responsible to look down the road and see that one cannot physically, mentally, emotionally or financially afford a child and have an abortion. Truly told, it would be more responsible to do that before having sex, but that does not negate that abortion can be responsible.\n \n Your 'solution' of \"DON'T HAVE SEX\" is fine and dandy, but it does not solve the problem of unwanted pregnancy. Sweeping it under the rug and ignoring it by saying \"Oh she shouldn't have been irresponsible\" does not help anyone's situation and does not change the fact that she was irresponsible. Then when you mandate by law that she remain pregnant is simply lazy and an unethical means to an end. And the end does not justify the means.",

   "I disagree that violence is the way to deal with abortionists, however I can understand why someone would be compelled to resort to violence. It's getting to the point where it's the only option some pro-lifers feel they have left to save lives. No unborn children will ever again die at the hands of Barnett Slepain, for instance. And that is a good thing. It's unfortunate that he had to die for that to happen though, and two wrongs really don't make a right. I'd not do it, and I don't condone it, but I certainly understand the feelings of those that do, and I could never stand in judgement on them.\n\n \n I agree that violence is sometimes a last resort. However, Daewoo wasted no time in threatening \"pro-choice\" people with several graphic descriptions of what he would like to do to us.\n \n The same can be said of rights. As I have quoted before: \"Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!\"\n \n Rights are what people fought and died for, rights and individual freedom are the cornerstone of the Constitution. The gov't was expressly forbidden any powers that were not expressly given in the Constitution. One of the things it should not be able to do is violate my rights, even to ensure another's survival no matter who it is. I would fight for my right to be free from oppression, to be free of an oppressive gov't. Luckily, we have a system (in theory) that allows us to fight with ideas, and those of us who are pro-choice have won. Now you are fighting to oppress women again, to make choices for them regarding their own pregnancies. \n \n Not only that, but how, pray tell, do you intend to enforce a ban? How will you stop women from throwing themselves on chairs, stop girls from asking their boyfriends to hit them with bats to cause a miscarriage? Abortions happened before it was legal, and going by the desire today (which wouldn't have changed all that much, not in such a short while) it was rampant. Will you do what Virginia is trying to do and make it law that every woman must report a miscarriage to police within 12 hours? How will you do this without disrespect to nearly every aspect of pregnancy and women's bodies?\n \n \n\n Actually, most of the world has a higher view of life period that we do here in the U.S. It seems that women elsewhere tend to have a higher view of having children than we do in our selfish, individualistic society.\n\n \n I would argue that wanting each and every pregnancy is a placing a high value on life and a high value on having children rather than forcing pregnancy by law.\n \n \n\n By \"civilized\" world I assume you mean some of Europe and Canada. I think parts of Europe, these so-called 'civilized' countries, have lost much of their high view of having and raising children.\n\n \n I disagree. I think a poor view of life, and a very poor view of women in general, pregnant women specifically and the value of children would be a gov't mandate on pregnancy and that pregnancy is forced by law to continue.",

A situation where there are a myriad of options to have a good nights sleep without harming that person does not compare to a situation where there is no other option to stop being pregnant besides removing the fetus from your body. Which is a much more detrimental condition than the one you describe, btw.\n \n \n\n Your implication that all governmental control is fascist and unethical is totally ludicrous.\n\n \n Not all gov't control.

   "It also guarantees the right to life. (See 14th amendment) In my opinion, abortion infringes upon the rights of another: the child and it's right to life.\n\n \n The fetus has no rights to violate. Even if it did, the fetus cannot violate the woman's rights under the 14th amendment and the woman should always be considered before any consideration of what is inside her. She is the most important participant in the pregnancy relationship.\n \n The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment states \"nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law . . . \" meaning the gov't has to use sufficiently clear and fair procedures to lawfully take these away. Because a woman has sex is not a sufficient justification to deprive women of their liberty in this matter. \n \n Mr. Justice Harlan once wrote: \"[T]he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause cannot be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution. This `liberty' is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property; the freedom of speech, press, and religion; the right to keep and bear arms; the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures; and so on. It is a rational continuum which, broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints . . . and which also recognizes, what a reasonable and sensitive judgment must, that certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of the state needs asserted to justify their abridgment.\" \n \n Justice Potter Stewart, a judge on the Roe v Wade case said in his concurring opinon: \"Several decisions of this Court make clear that freedom of personal choice in matters of marriage and family life is one of the liberties protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. . . . As recently as last Term, in Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438, 453, we recognized \"the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child.\" \" \n \n That right necessarily includes the right of a woman to decide whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.\n \n \n\n If your rights infringe upon another, then it most certainly CAN and should prevent you from having that right, at least to all abandon. Abortion infringes on the right to life.\n\n \n Agreed, and the fetus is infringing on the woman's. Abortion does not violate the fetus' rights because the fetus has no rights to violate. Even if it did, that would still not allow the fetus to infringe upon her rights. And she is more important.\n \n \n\n Apparently legal abortion isn't entirely working, as 'baseball bat' abortions still go on, despite the avenues the girl could have followed for abortion.\n\n \n Agreed. There is something terribly wrong if girls have to resort to this when she should have had access to an abortion.\n \n \n\n But either way, your logic here is like saying we should allow homicide to be legal so that no one does it in an unsafe way that would injure the one doing the murdering. Or it's like legalizing anyone to have a professional-grade explosives lab to prevent them from getting hurt in case they do it 'at home' in their kitchen in an unsafe way. This is very faulty logic of yours.\n\n \n No. You are setting up a strawman, because this was not my justification for abortion. It was to outline the horrific and disrespectful violation of rights that would almost have to occur in order to effectively enforce a ban.\n \n \n\n You have no way to prove this.\n\n \n Nothing besides reason and logic. Women are not being forced or brainwashed into having an abortion. The desire did not just appear when abortion was legal, so it is reasonable to assume the desire was equally strong before it was legal especially given how young the law is. It is reasonable because the birthrate in this country remained unchanged between when it was illegal and then legal, and it is also reasonable to assume that there were roughly the same number of illegal abortions performed as legal ones because of that fact. It is reasonable to say that the desire was always there because there are abortion recipes written on ancient tombs. And it is reasonable to assume that it was passed down mother to daughter as \"woman's secrets\" before even that. The desire to control whether or not she has bears a child has always been there.",

   "A baby is a little person that grows up to be a big person, or a little animal that grows up to be a big animal.\n\n \n lol, is it? Do you color in the lines, too? :p \n \n The fetus is not a person, so I suppose it is outside of this definition. Care to restate \"abortion kills babies\"?\n \n You have to make a distinction between born children and a fetus, because their circumstances are so radically different that there is little to no comparison.\n \n \n\n You can ALWAYS change the consequences of your actions. 2:00 Am, driving down the road drunk off your XXX, 95 miles an hour, and you get pulled over. Sure, you may be royally screwed, but NOT if, as soon as officer friendly walks up, you whip out a .357 and blow his head off. Then you can basically go home and go to bed. \n \n Murdering someboys in order to avoid the consequences of your actions.\n\n \n Er, ok. Neither sex nor abortion is illegal, so your analogy does not apply. You have a myriad of options allowing the cop to live and the cop is not violating your rights by pulling you over, while banning abortion violates women's rights. There is no justification for your scenario because the circumstances do not justify killing the cop. In the pregnancy relationship, there is every justification for killing the fetus.\n \n \n\n Motherhood has nothing to do with abortion. Pregnancy, yes, you have sex, you end up pregnant, you should have to live with that, not kill in order to get out of it. Lotd of people have had babies are mothers. Lots of folks who have never had a baby are mothers. Motherhood is the rtaising of the baby. Pregnancy is just a matter of having the baby. The two are not mutually inclusive.\n\n \n Motherhood has much to do with pregnancy, however, and abortion has to do with pregnancy. You are a biological mother if you give birth. Other connotations of \"mother\" do indeed include actually caring for a child, but we aren't dealing with shadings of meanings or actually caring for a child. We are dealing with pregnancy and childbirth.\n \n No, you should not \"have to life with that\". Pregnancy and motherhood should never be forced because one has no other choice. It should always be wanted.\n \n \n\n Nobody is advocating forcing anybody to be a parent.\n\n \n You are advocating forcing women to provide the body for the fetus inside them. You are advocating forcing women to give birth. Whatever the connotations, she is the biological parent so yes you are advocating forcing her to be a parent. \n \n \n\n I am not talking about using pregnancy as a punishment, it is just the result of a chosen action that has to be dealt with, and preferably wihtout murdering anybody. If you shoot yourself in the foot, the hole in your foot is the direct result of your actions. It is not \"punishment\".\n\n \n If you are refused treatement by law on the rationale that \"you brought in on yourself\" then it is indeed a punishment for being stupid and irresponsible, and pregnancy is an intimate and special relationship that should never be used as a punishment.\n \n Who says she has to \"deal with it\"? You? The gov't? Why should either be able to force her to \"deal with it\" in the way you want her to? Why can she not deal with it in the way she chooses, including stopping the life-support functions she is involved in? Why must she donate her body, organs and life-processes when she does not wish to? \n \n Consenting to sex is consenting to sex, it is not consenting to donating your organs for 9 months.\n \n \n\n No, you have absolute control over your children, but you are not allowed to kill them, nor are you allowed to let them die through intentional negligence. It is not a hard concept.\n\n \n Where is the absolute control? I do not undertand why you brought up the \"permission\" issue since there is no need for permission. It is just a formality.\n \n \n\n Again, you are not allowed to kill your kids. This is not a difficult concept to grasp.\n\n \n Again, the situation of a fetus is to different from a born child to make any sort of comparison in this manner. Being able to cut your body from being used by a fetus does not translate at all into being able to take an axe to your kids.",

Hate to tell you this, but the fetus is never the one who does the violating. It is completely inactive in the situation; in fact the actions of the mother by getting pregnant are what causes this supposed violation of her own 'rights.' To blame it on the fetus is a sad attempt to shift responsibility to the one party that played the least role in setting things in motion.\n \n And your view that the fetus has no rights is not true--it does have the right to life, which is why criminals get prosecuted and sentenced for homicide on an unborn child all the time. (Think Scott Peterson) It's just that our sick society has caved to special interest groups who want women to be the one exception with the power to take away and infringe on the fetus' right to life. \n \n As you said yourself, the 14th Amendment states that \"\"nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law . . . \" Everytime an abortion takes place, the right to life for the fetus is infringed.\n \n \nThere is something terribly wrong if girls have to resort to this when she should have had access to an abortion.\n\n \n I agree--it IS terribly wrong that the abortion laws still don't do as you claim: stop non-clinical abortion.\n \n \nWomen are not being forced or brainwashed into having an abortion. \n\n \n But by making it so easy, it is being encouraged.

   "LOL. Hate to tell you this, but the fetus is never the one who does the violating.\n\n \n The fetus is in constant conflict with the woman over the resources of her body. In an ideal situation the woman would welcome this, but it does not negate that the fetus is instigating changes that are detrimental to her health and it has no right to do that, it does so at the sole sufferance of the woman. For the gov't to support the right of the fetus over the woman is a gross violation of her rights.\n \n \n\n It is completely inactive in the situation; in fact the actions of the mother by getting pregnant are what causes this supposed violation of her own 'rights.'\n\n \n If she is violating her own rights, then the fetus is part of her body and she has every right to control her own body to stop this violation of her own rights she is doing.

(Think Scott Peterson) It's just that our sick society has caved to special interest groups who want women to be the one exception with the power to take away and infringe on the fetus' right to life.\n\n \n And now it's caving in to special interests trying to make abortion illegal.\n \n No, the fetus has no rights, not when they conflict with the woman's. Abortion is legal, and women cannot be prosecuted for acquiring them. \n \n \n\n As you said yourself, the 14th Amendment states that \"\"nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law . . . \" Everytime an abortion takes place, the right to life for the fetus is infringed.\n\n \n Oh? Remember, \"...shall any State...\". When was the last time the State performed an abortion?\n \n The fetus does not have the right to live at the expense of women's rights. Then, the State is directly violating her right to liberty in this manner. You claim the fetus has rights, and we know the woman has rights. If they conflict, the woman is always more important.\n \n \n\n I agree--it IS terribly wrong that the abortion laws still don't do as you claim: stop non-clinical abortion.\n\n \n Nothing will stop that except a massive reordering of our society. Making abortion illegal will not stop them, and that is your and my goal. You will only make them more dangerous to women. That is abhorrent.\n \n The only thing that will stop abortions is respect for women. Abortions will stop when women are given the honor and support they deserve. \"Respect for life\" is meaningless... what we should do is respect women because life comes through them. Women should receive the support they need to have successful pregnancies because there is no pregnancy without her. Respect does not include treating them like broodmares with no say in their own future. Respect is allowing them to make their own decisions.\n \n \n\n But by making it so easy, it is being encouraged. As someone pointed out, allowing abortion by youths with no parental consent makes it easier to abort a baby than it is to go on a school field trip.\n\n \n It is ridiculous to think that anything except an extreme minority have abortions easily. Nearly every abortion is a very trying and agonizing decision for women. You are very demeaning toward women in general and mothers in particular when you intimidate that abortions are done at the drop of a hat. Your attitude does nothing to help any situation. You do not want to stop abortion, you simply want to control women.\n \n \n\n If you can't see the problem with that, either you are deliberately not trying or you're so sold to the pro-choice political movement that you are are closed-minded to even consider the ironies and problems being brought up to you.\n\n \n No, I do not see a problem with minors being able to have abortions without parental consent. I believe that it is much more preferable than anyone being able to force any girl or woman to give birth. Pregnancy is an extremely personal and intimate condition for a woman. Whatever decision she makes is her own. \n \n \nThe exageration and lying by pro-choice sources and political websites probably don't help either.\n\n \n Both sides exaggerate and lie.",

Women dying due to complications resultign from preganacy are pretty rare.

In cases where the pregnancy endagers the womans life, I think there is room for discussion.

They are simply convenience abortions sought by people too self absorbed and selfish to deal with the consequences of their choices. They are willing to kill for convenience.\n \n \nActually you do only advocate responsibility for the woman. And for the very reason you dismiss here. Please show me a single pregnant man. Just one.

I love men who seem to harbor the illusion that they have ANY clue about pregnancy. Do tell - how is it not fun for you? Bride not as cute and sweet as you would like? \n \n \n Actually, my wife becomes a borderline psychotic when she is preganant, and she knows it. She thinks it is funny (at least, not when she is pregnant). I personally have found that pregnant women generall have it as bad as they think they do. Example....My wife and sister in law were pregnant at the sam e time. My wife took the physical discomfort in stride (though, as I pointed out, she more or less becomes a lunatic when pregnant, this is not her fault, it is a hormonal thing). My sister in law on the other hand seemd to focus a good deal of her time and attention to how miserable pregnancy was. My mother (who had 8 children) claims that the dicomfort and difficulty inherent to your pregnancy is directly proportional to how much the woman feels she needs to whine about it. I have 5 sisters, have seen all them have children, have 2 children of my own, I have seen a lot of pregnant women, and you can almost always pick out who is goin got have a terrible, horrible preganancy and who is going to have a more pleasant one based on their attitude in general.\n \n I would guess that yours was a terrible horibble ordeal in your mind. You seem to be a weak, whiney person in general. \n You may pity my children - I pity your wife.\n \n \n \nActually I don't have a chip on my shoulder. But I there are those who like to call a spade a spade - ane then there are those who like to call it a freakin shovel. I am in that last group. I have no patience whatsoever for sanctamoanious pro-life men who dismiss women and the issues they face, and then try to tell sell me the story that they care about \"life\". Half the population is female and you trivialize us all. That makes you a misogynist - and nothing more - anything else you may say is window dressing. \n \n \n I have seen you jump down the throat of at least a half dozen guys who have made innocent comments, more often than not comments which have nothign to do with women, and you have jumped down their throat for it. It often takes several posts before anybody can even figure out what you percieved to be the insult, and often it seems that you do not even know.\n \n I recognise that you have had some bad experiences with men. Rather than mastering those experiences and using them for perosnal gain, you have allowed them to master you. This is a sign of weakness, as well as being a pretty serious personality flaw. You might want to look into some therapy.\n \n \nAnd for the record I am the single mom of THE COOLEST kid to ever walk the earth. He rules my wolrd and knows it.\n\n \n Does he know that, as a man, you hate him? Do you dress him up in girls clothing and beat his tallywacker with a ruler since he is unfortunate enough to be growing up with a mother who hates men?\n \n Do you plan to pass on the results of your weakness and personality flaws to him? Nice to know thta you are planting the seed of self hate in him early. Especially nice that it is in the form of something he can do nothing about. \n \n \n \nNow who is being childish? \n \n Not to mention, there are those of us open minded folk out here who do not consider homosexulality a personality flaw and find a comment like this about as insulting as trying to insult me by saying I have brown hair.\n\n \n Not trying to insult you, just asking a question, and given the information available here, it would seem to be a vlaid one. We know you hate men (or at least are so obsessively anti men that no man in his right mind would be willing to put up with your condescending needling). We know you have a child, and we know you were once married.\n \n There seem to be 2 possibilities. One, you found out too late (after marriage, pregnacy, etc...) that you are a lesbian. It happens. Or, two, you lack the strnght of characher to deal with the negative experinces of your past wihtout allowing them to impact you negatively.\n \n Since you apparently see the lesbian question as an insult, I guess it is #2. Not really a surprise, from some of your other previous posts it is pretty evident that you are the kind of person who prides themsleves in their strength, despite the fact that they have no real idea what stregth is (and often mistake bitchiness for strength). I lived with a girl like that for a couple years in college. Sad case, really, abuse in her past, hypersensitivity in any situation that she felt a man might even possibly be advocating control or domination over a woman, a series of failed relationships. She, too, thought she was an uncommonly strong person, when in reality all he bluster and BS was a nothing but a fron, and not a particularly good one.\n \n She eventually went to a counselor who helped get her straightened out. Now she really IS one of hte strongest people I know, because she has learned to dominate the unpleasantness of her past as opposed to the other way around.\n \n Oddly enough, we always got along just fine, which surprised a lot of people since I was dating her best friend (my wife). The key is that I never try to dominate women, nor do I require control in a relationship. I am pretty easy to get along with. I was raised in a house with 5 sisters and an exceptionally strong willed mother. I would not settle for a woman who is willing to be dominated. I prefer a woman who is my equal, or even superior, in all areas and knows it. Trophy wives are not for me.",

Women dying due to complications resultign from preganacy are pretty rare. Sure, it is uncomfortable and it requires certain adjustments to the way you live your life for a few months, but it doens't kill you. In cases where the pregnancy endagers the womans life, I think there is room for discussion. Most abortions done in this country, though, have nothing to do with endangering the mothers life, or to do with rape. They are simply convenience abortions sought by people too self absorbed and selfish to deal with the consequences of their choices. They are willing to kill for convenience.\n\n \n Thank you for proving my point about dismissing the circumstances of women. Do you really beleive the only circumstances a woman faces that may impact her pregnancy and decisions around it are potential death or rape? Medical reasons outside of death, medications she may need, pre-existing conditions or new ones that may occur, financial reasons, access to medical care, being young, being scared, being in an abusive relationship, being alone, having an education and/or job (that may provide for OTHER children) threatened, addiction, and a million other reasons are ALL circumstances. They are ALL valid. You dismiss them ALL. \n \n Believe it or not I believe abortion and unplanned prgenancy numbers numbers are alarming and need to be addressed. But you offer no solution - just insults and cages. Just how many successful pregnancies do you think you can have without the mother's cooperation?\n \n But all I see you do is preach, condemn and trivialize women. No law will fix this until lifers like you fix THAT attitude.\n \n \nwow, you did go for the childish approach. You are correct. No man can ever get pregnant. He can still provide support, etc... during the course of the pregnancy.\n\n \n He still doesn't have to be pregnant. Being nice to a woman while she is pregnant is not being pregnant. Here you are trivializing women and their circumstances again. \n \n \nActually, my wife becomes a borderline psychotic when she is preganant, and she knows it. She thinks it is funny (at least, not when she is pregnant). I personally have found that pregnant women generall have it as bad as they think they do. Example....My wife and sister in law were pregnant at the sam e time. My wife took the physical discomfort in stride (though, as I pointed out, she more or less becomes a lunatic when pregnant, this is not her fault, it is a hormonal thing). My sister in law on the other hand seemd to focus a good deal of her time and attention to how miserable pregnancy was. My mother (who had 8 children) claims that the dicomfort and difficulty inherent to your pregnancy is directly proportional to how much the woman feels she needs to whine about it. I have 5 sisters, have seen all them have children, have 2 children of my own, I have seen a lot of pregnant women, and you can almost always pick out who is goin got have a terrible, horrible preganancy and who is going to have a more pleasant one based on their attitude in general.\n\n \n And again. How a pregnancy impacts each woman will depend on the woman. \n \n And please refrain from telling me what it's like to be pregnant. I actually do know.\n \n \nI would guess that yours was a terrible horibble ordeal in your mind.\n\n \n I liked parts, disliked others, at times it was uncomfortable, at times scary, at times magical, by the end of nine months I was ready to be done with it and got a great kid in return.\n \n \nYou seem to be a weak, whiney person in general.\n\n \n And you seem to be a self-absorbed, short-sighted, hateful, can't see past his own XXX XXXXX. \n \n \nI have seen you jump down the throat of at least a half dozen guys who have made innocent comments, more often than not comments which have nothign to do with women, and you have jumped down their throat for it. It often takes several posts before anybody can even figure out what you percieved to be the insult, and often it seems that you do not even know.\n\n \n That generally only happens in this thread and I hate to break it to you sunshine but abortion and pregnancy have EVERYTHING to do with women - to say otherwise indicates that you are a blithering idiot.\n \n Secondly - when I have expressed my vehement disagreement I think I am pretty clear why (as they tend to respond) - if you ever aren't clear, feel free to ask, I will clarify.\n \n \nI recognise that you have had some bad experiences with men. Rather than mastering those experiences and using them for perosnal gain, you have allowed them to master you. This is a sign of weakness, as well as being a pretty serious personality flaw. You might want to look into some therapy.\n\n \n Let me see.\n \n I was raped and abused. But I split eventually.

Since then I have:\n \n Doubled my income\n Started my own business\n Taught myself to play bass guitar\n Have traveled all over North America with my son\n Bought a house\n Found faith in God\n Made lots of friends\n Found THE BEST man on the planet as a co-parent, male mentor, and father for my son \n Am really, really happy\n \n So let's be clear. I disagree with you. I think you are wrong. I think your views on women are horrible. I think you are a jerk. I will tell you so and not mince words. If you see every woman who isn't meekly agreeing with you and liking you all the time as a sign of weakness - that is your problem.\n \n \nDoes he know that, as a man, you hate him?

There are many men who like me plenty and I like them, too. I just don't like you or your attitude towards women.
