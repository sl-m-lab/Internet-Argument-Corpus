   "Lets hear ur thoughts on this subject \n\n \n The following thoughts are the sermon notes of pastor John Keating, who has graciously given me permission me to share them with whomever is interested. \n \n Bible Doctrine Church\n Website: http://bibledoctrinechurch.org/\n Attn: John Keating\n 700 Munras Avenue\n Monterey, CA 93940 \n Phone: 831-394-2708 \n \n \n NOWHERE in the Scriptures does it say that the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah was homosexual sex. Even if the specific point of the story was concerning a sexual matter, rather than hospitality, the real issue is rape not homosexuality. Jesus claimed the issue was simply one of showing hospitality to strangers (Luke 10:10-12). How ironic that those who discriminate against homosexuals actually seem to be the true practitioners of the sin of Sodom.\n \n 2. The story of Sodom: Genesis 19 is one of the most commonly cited anti-homosexual passages in the Bible. It is so frequently used that the term \"Sodomite\" that once referred to an inhabitant of Sodom, has become a legal term for criminal sexual acts, & has also become a derogatory synonym for a homosexual.\n \n This story is generally thought of in terms of the fate of a single town: Sodom. But according to Deut. 29:22-29, God's anger caused a number of cities to be destroyed. It involved: \"...the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the LORD overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath.\" \n \n Unfortunately, the real names of Sodom and Gomorrah were not preserved. Sodom was derived from the Hebrew word \"S'dom,\" which means \"burnt.\" Gomorrah is derived from the Hebrew word \"'Amorah,\" which means \"a ruined heap.\" These appear to be place names which were assigned after the disaster. \n \n Genesis 19 describes how two angels visited the Canaanite city of Sodom. The city had just experienced warfare (Gen. 14:1-2) and was probably on high alert to forestall more conflict. Lot welcomed the angels into his house. They had been sent to warn him that God was displeased with the wickedness of the city's residents. God had decided to destroy a large geographical area, including the city of Sodom. All of the people from the city gathered around the house and demanded that Lot send the strangers to the mob so that they might \"know\" the angels. (The Hebrew verb ya,dah - to know, is ambiguous. It appears 943 times in the Hebrew Scriptures (Old Testament). In only about a dozen of these cases does it refer to sexual activity. It is not clear whether the mob wanted to rape the angels or to just meet with them, and perhaps attack them physically. Sensing evil intent by the citizens of Sodom, Lot refused. As an alternative, he offered his two virgin daughters to be raped by the mob, if that would appease them. The offer was declined. God was apparently not critical of Lot for offering his two daughters to be raped. However, God was angry at the other inhabitants of the town. The angels blinded some of the mob. Later, the angels urged Lot and his family to flee and to not look back. Unfortunately, Lot's wife seems to have had an inquisitive mind. She looked the wrong way, so God killed her on the spot and turned her into a pillar of salt.\n \n He destroyed Sodom with fire and brimstone (sulfur). He presumably killed all of the men in the mob, their wives and other adults, as well as children, infants, newborns, etc. \n \n \"Traditional Churchianity\" has accepted the explanation of homosexual relations to explain what happened. In fact, the term sodomy which means anal intercourse is derived from the name of the city, Sodom. Actually inhospitality is the correct explanation! As recorded in Mat. 10:14-15 and Lk. 10:7-16, Jesus implied that the sin of the people of Sodom was to be inhospitable to strangers. In Ezek. 16:48-50, God states clearly that he destroyed Sodom's sins because of their pride, their excess of food while the poor and needy suffered, and worshiped many idols; sexual activity is not even mentioned. \n \n We are faced with the inescapable and rather amusing conclusion that the condemned activities in Sodom had nothing to do with sodomy. The story of Sodom and Gomorrah actually condemns inhospitality and idolatry, not homosexuality. \n \n 3. Genesis 19:4 -- Who was in the mob?\n \n According to the King James Version of the Bible, Genesis 19:4 says: \"...the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter.\" (KJV) \n \n The KJV translation is ambiguous. The first part of the verse talks about \"the men of Sodom,\" -- that is, a male group. The second part talks about \"all the people,\" -- presumably men, women, and children. The ambiguity appears to be due the phrase in the original Hebrew that is transliterated as \"anshei ha'ir, anshei S'dom.\" It meant \"the people of the city, the people of Sodom.\" It appears that the KJV translators perhaps influenced by their homophobia, chose a translation that would make the mob all male. The original Hebrew text says that everyone in Sodom -- men, women and children -- were there. Today, San Francisco has the reputation for being the \"gayest\" city in the world. Yet even in San Francisco, gay men constitute far less than half the total male population. To suggest that every man & boy in Sodom was homosexual is simply not credible. Any reasonable interpretation of the story must account for the fact that \"all the males\" (both homosexual and heterosexual), and perhaps even the women, participated in this attack. Something other than homosexual desire seems to have been at work here.\n \n 4. Genesis 19:5 -- What does \"ya,dah\" mean?\n \n According to the King James Version of the Bible, Genesis 19:5 says: \"And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know (Heb. ya,da) them.\" (KJV) \n \n Ya,dah is a Hebrew verb which is commonly translated as \"know.\" Its meaning is ambiguous. In most passages it generally talks about a man \"knowing\" a woman and of her conceiving a child as a result of the \"knowing.\" All such references involve heterosexual relationships. \n \n It is not clear (in the KJV) whether the mob wanted to:\n \n a. Gang rape the angels. This was a common technique by which men, particularly enemies, were humiliated in that society. \n \n b. Engage in consensual homosexual sex with the angels: This is the interpretation of the NIV translators. They wrote very clearly that the intent was to \"have sex with them.\" \n \n c. Interrogate them. They may have been concerned that the strangers were spies who were sent to the city to determine its defensive fortifications. \"Sodom was a tiny fortress in the barren wasteland south of the Dead Sea. The only strangers that the people of Sodom ever saw were enemy tribes who wanted to destroy and take over their valuable fortress and the trade routes that it protected.\" As noted above, the city had just recently survived just such an attack, and may have been on high alert. \n \n d. Attack them physically. \n \n 5. Gen. 19:8 -- Lot's offer to have his daughters gang raped: From the context, it is obvious that the mood of the mob was not friendly. Lot may have assessed that they had sex on their minds, because he offered his virgin daughters as an attempt to placate the mob. Some Christian interpreters maintain that all of the men in the city were present in the mob, and that all were homosexual. Lot would certainly have known of this, for he was a resident of the city. If they were all gay, then he would hardly have made a gift of his daughters to be raped; the mob would have had no sexual interest in women. It's obvious that Lot believed the crowd outside his door was predominantly heterosexual. Why else would he offer his daughters?\n \n If they were ALL homosexual, he would have given the mob a gift of his two future son-in-laws. His daughters were both engaged to men from Sodom. In their culture, engagement was a binding arrangement, with many of the properties of marriage. It gave Lot authority over his future son-in-laws, much as he had control of his daughters. So he would have been able to sacrifice his daughter's fianc\u00e9es. But he didn't. Thus, we can conclude that most or all of the men of Sodom were not gay. 13. Another indication that the all the men of Sodom were not gay is seen in a number of biblical references which emphasize that one of the serious sins of Sodom was their neglect of orphans and widows. If all male \"Sodomites\" were gay then there would be few or no marriages and thus few or no widows and orphans.\n \n 6. A final indication is that Lot's future sons-in-law were from Sodom and were engaged to be married to his daughters. It is apparent that they were not homosexuals. God was apparently not critical of Lot for offering his two daughters to be raped. If he were, he might have decided to not save Lot and his family. \n \n 7. Why did God exterminate all the men, women and children of Sodom? The text of Gen. 19 implies that God approved of Lot's behavior, even though he made an offer of his virgin daughters to be raped. This approval would have been extended to Lot's family as well. But God had a fierce anger directed at the other inhabitants of the town. He destroyed Sodom with fire and brimstone (sulfur) dumped from above. He presumably killed all of the men and Women of Sodom, as well as all the innocent children, infants, newborns, etc. who lived in the city. It is unclear from this brief passage in Genesis whether God demolished the city because the citizens habitually:\n \n a. Engaged in consensual homosexual acts -- a same-sex orgy in this case. This is the belief of most conservative Christians.\n \n b. Were uncharitable and abusive to strangers, the poor, sick, and disadvantaged. In that society, a person had a very strong obligation to protect any guests in their home. Other Christians believe that this is the meaning behind the story of the destruction of Sodom.\n \n c. Humiliated their visitors by engaging in \"an act of sexual degradation and male rape...These are acts of violence that are committed by parties seeking to show their hatred for those they are degrading. It is not an act of love or of caring\". Perhaps the sin of Sodom was the threat of mass rape.\n \n d. Wanted to engage in bestiality -- having sex with a member of another species. The mob may have wanted to rape the angels; angels are not human beings; they are of a different species. This would be consistent with the quotation in Jude about the men of Sodom going after \"other flesh.\"\n \n 8. Accessing other biblical passages to understand Genesis 19: A common procedure in biblical apologetics is to let the Bible interpret the Bible. Looking elsewhere in the Bible for references to Sodom may help us determine which of the four above interpretations is correct. \n \n a. The interpretation of Gen. 19 as referring to a homosexual sin appears to have been created in the 11th century by the Italian ascetic St. Peter Damian. Christian theologians generally accepted this explanation until recently. In fact, the English word sodomy, which popularly means either homosexual or heterosexual anal intercourse, was derived from the name of the city. The term sodomy is also used in some ancient laws to refer to a variety of sexual behaviors in addition to heterosexual intercourse. Some of these laws are still on the books although the U.S. Supreme Court declared them unconstitutional in 2003-JUN. Opinion among most liberal and mainline Christian and Jewish theologians has now reverted to the original Christian belief that Gen. 19 refers to a lack of charity and to ill treatment of strangers. Consider:\n \n b. In ancient Jewish literature, such as the Ethics of the Fathers and the Talmud, there are many references to Sodom. The phrase \"middat Sdom\" was used. It may be translated as \"the way the people of Sodom thought\". It meant a lack of charity and hospitality towards others; ignoring the needs of the poor, etc. In the Middle East, a person's survival could depend upon the charity of strangers. To help strangers was a solemn religious duty of paramount importance. See Lev. 19:33-34 and Mat. 25:35, 38 & 43.\n \n c. Many believe that texts in Genesis and the rest of the Bible make it clear that Sodom was punished because of the violent, abusive, inhospitable, greedy, and unsympathetic behavior of its citizens towards visitors, widows, the poor and other disadvantaged persons. Gen. 19 may condemn homosexual rape simply because it is rape. It would then be consistent with Deut. 22:25-29 which condemns heterosexual rape. The passage does not impact on consensual homosexual activities between consenting adults, and is totally unrelated to loving, committed, same-sex relationships, civil unions and marriages. \n \n There is an ironic aspect to this passage that is rarely discussed: God seems to condemn the citizens for insensitive treatment and harassment of others. But, this is the very passage that many conservative and some mainline Christian faith groups use to attack gays and lesbians. \n \n 9. The real story of Sodom may well have involved a mob driven by fear and hatred, attempting to humiliate, by rape, people that they do not know. Ironically, the Sodom situation has many parallels to gay-bashing today, with members of the public trying to assault gay and lesbian strangers who seek shelter from the mob. This is a story about attempted mob violence, not homosexual desire. \n \n 10. To test this proposition, let's ask a simple question. Suppose the 2 angels in the story had been women, but the story otherwise unfolded exactly the same: The men of Sodom clamored to have sex with the 2 female angels and God destroyed the city. Do you think anyone would conclude this story was a blanket condemnation of heterosexuality? Of course not! Instead, we all would conclude (correctly) that the wickedness of Sodom was shown by their desire to sexually violate two strangers in their midst, and perhaps simply to humiliate them not because of any particular sexual lust pattern.\n \n 11. In fact, this is the way other writers of the Bible interpreted this story (see the many references in the last class on Sodom and Gomorrah). We noted that NONE of them said that homosexuality was the sin of Sodom.\n \n 12. In total, the Bible contains six phrases which touch on homosexual behavior. Given the hundreds of commandments and thousands of pages, I can't see how homosexuality is of much interest to the scriptures. The Bible contains much more material condoning slavery and confining the rights of women than it does speaking about homosexuality. The fact that many Christians condemn homosexuality with righteous appeals to the scriptures is an example of bringing to the Bible what is really a twentieth century preoccupation and pretending that a handful of sentences from the Bible correspond to our modern anxieties over sexuality. I would submit that their interpretation is driven by anti-gay prejudice. Many Christians only know the stereotypes they learned in childhood. They buy into the idea that all gay men are predators and that loving relationships between inherently homosexual people do not exist. And thus they assume that Gen. 19 must be a sweeping condemnation of homosexuality, and that all homosexuality takes the form shown in that story. Actually, this story is at most a condemnation of homosexual rape or could it be heterosexual rape? And, as other Scriptures affirm, it is more generally a condemnation of the mistreatment of those who are most vulnerable, including strangers.\n \n 13. Thus, the condemned activities in Sodom probably had nothing to do with sodomy. As one Christian editor wrote: \"To suggest that Sodom and Gomorra is about homosexual sex is an analysis of about as much worth as suggesting that the story of Jonah and the whale is a treatise on fishing.\"",

   "The following thoughts are the sermon notes of pastor John Keating, who has graciously given me permission me to share them with whomever is interested. \n \n Bible Doctrine Church\n Website: http://bibledoctrinechurch.org/\n Attn: John Keating\n 700 Munras Avenue\n Monterey, CA 93940 \n Phone: 831-394-2708 \n \n \n CAN GAYS/LESBIANS BE SAVED? According to the Bible, it is God who creates people (regardless of sexual orientation). He forms us as we are. Our genes, our temperaments, our time and place in history, our talents, our gifts, our weaknesses -- all are part of God's inscrutable and loving plan for us. So, somehow God must be behind the fact that some people are homosexual. Why then would God's word condemn it? Does it mean that these people are \"mistakes\"? God doesn't make mistakes; but humans do, in Biblical interpretation for example. These are facts to think about when considering this issue and the relevance and meaning of the verses in the Bible so commonly used to condemn homosexuals. The clear message to the gay community from the modern Church has been one of rejection. Gay people, like many other minorities or small eccentric groups, have been labeled as unacceptable to the kingdom of God. In the same way that the Jews considered Gentiles as unclean, gays have been treated as filthy; rubbish to be thrown out. Some (like this church) have rejected this blanket statement and have attempted to reach out; understanding that Jesus' mission was not one of condemnation, but salvation. But, nowhere in scripture can anyone justify hate as a proper response to homosexuals or anyone else. All people (includes gays, or minorities, or any other \"undesirables\", etc.) are the creation of God. Just being different doesn't mean they should be treated different. Instead, James says to treat all alike without discrimination (Jam. 2:1-4). \n \n The Bible clearly says that God's free gift of grace (unmerited favor) is extended to all who by faith receive it (Rom. 5:2). \"For God so loved the world, that he gave his one and only Son, that WHOEVER believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.\" (John 3:16) \"Everyone who calls upon the name of the LORD shall be saved.\" (Joel 2:32) Paul teaches \"there is no difference between Jew and Gentile, the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him, for everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.\" (Rom. 10:12-13) \"All the Father gives me will come to me, and WHOEVER comes to me I will never drive away.\" (John 6:37) \n \n These important passages paint a picture that no matter what some misguided churches or even Christians may have said or done, God's love is extended to WHOEVER will respond to His free gift of grace. Jesus did not come to bring condemnation to anyone, but so that the world through Him might be saved (John 3:17). Therefore, those who do not extend the free gift of God's unmerited favor to EVERYONE as it was extended to them, are not abiding in the clear teaching of the New Testament. The witness of the Holy Spirit is all anyone needs (Rom. 8:16) to come to the inward security of knowing who they really are: a child of God!\n \n 3. THE LAW OF MOSES: The first five books of the Old Testament are called the Pentateuch (literally 5 tools). They are traditionally attributed to Moses' authorship and contain the Law (Torah). The Law contains more than six hundred regulations governing everyday living for the Children of Israel. They cover everything from instructions on how to wear clothes and prepare ceremonial foods to laws concerning the observance of holy days and punishments requirements for certain crimes. The Law was specifically given to the Israelites and never intended to be the law for the Gentiles. In that sense, none of us have ever been under the Law and there is no need for us to be under it now. \n \n The Apostle Paul observed that the ones who have fallen away from grace (Gal. 5:4) are the ones who have put themselves under the Law. This was a sect known as the Judaizers and is not referring to those without the Law. The Law was given to show that the righteousness of God could not be obtained by legalistically keeping rules. It gave the people knowledge of sin (Rom. 3:20) and demonstrated the impossibility of ANYONE being able to measure up and be accepted by God on the basis of keeping it. \n \n The major source of condemnation today against homosexuality and other social moral issues, has come from those who have not fully grasped the significance of the law of Grace as opposed to the Law of Moses and their belief that homosexuality is a violation of God's Law. Nearly every argument against homosexuality has at its root the Law of Moses. They mistakenly believe that \"sodomy\" is forbidden by the Law. This is not true. The word \"sodomy\" is a modern word, coined under the mistaken belief that Sodom was destroyed because of rampant homosexuality. We have seen in our last lesson that this is not true. The word \"sodomy\" does not appear in any of the main translations (KJV, RSV, NASB, or NIV). It has taken on new meaning in this century referring to any sexual act other than copulation between a man and a woman who are married to each other. It varies from state to state in its legal definition. This variance illustrates one of the prime difficulties in understanding the Scripture in its original language. To understand and explain what the writer has written, one must understand the words the writer used as the writer understood them. Word meanings change over time and the unlearned can come away from passages with a total misunderstanding of the writer's meaning. \n \n 4. The approach to Leviticus: The book of Leviticus is a product of its culture. Not only that, it is a commentary of the Law as represented in the Ten Commandments. The writers were neither scientists nor historians writing from expertise, but were persons of faith -- priests, writing from the unique experiences that they encountered. They were problem solvers in an era where simplistic, yet decisive actions were necessitated by illnesses and controversies that arose within the camp of the tribe of Israel. They were people who were forced to make quick and sudden decisions as need arose. For 21st Christians to use these formulas as criteria for ethical and moral decision making would be naive at best, heresy at worst. The priests used the tools of knowledge at their disposal, just as we are required to use the tools of knowledge available to us. Today, we can benefit from thousands of years of learning!\n \n Bottom line -- the arguments suggesting and concerning homosexuality in Leviticus as well as in all of scripture, must be treated equally. The Bible is not a cafeteria; there can be no picking and choosing! The rules of interpretation must be consistent across the board. Therefore, the Leviticus text must be critiqued as a whole, and not willy-nilly in order to defend or condemn a particular point of view. A verse taken out of its context is never an appropriate rule of measure for doing biblical exegesis and interpretation with integrity. This is especially so with the Book of Leviticus. A little common sense never hurt either!\n \n At the beginning of the chapter that includes the passages we will study, Lev. 18:3 states: \"After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in their ordinances.\" Here, God is saying that the Hebrews are not to follow the practices of the Egyptians or of the Canaanites. Homosexual ritual sex in temples of both countries was common. Thus, one might assume (since it's the same context) that Lev. 18:22 relates to temple same-sex rituals -- something that was ritually impure.\n \n 4. An Abomination - Leviticus 18:22 & 20:13: Perhaps the two most widely abused verses used to condemn homosexuality come from Leviticus. \n \n Leviticus 18:22: You shall not lie (Qal imperfect of shakab - to lay down with sexually) with mankind as one lies (Qal imperfect of shakab - to lay down with sexually) with womankind; this is an abomination.(Hebrew word toevah referring to the act as being \"detestable\" or an \"abomination\". This word literally means \"culturally forbidden\".) The term abomination is generally associated with idolatry and the Canaanite religious practice of cult prostitution (see note #3 above). Given toevah's strong association with cult prostitution it is unlikely that this passage applies to loving responsible homosexual relationships. This verse says nothing about consensual same-sex activity today. It only condemns same-sex religious prostitution. \n \n The Hebrews used special words to condemn specific wicked or abominable misdeeds. If this passage had been referring to sexual misconduct, the writer would have used the word zimmah instead of toevah. \n \n The land was full of idolatry. The Palestinian god of the sun, Baal and his consort, the fertility goddess Ashtorath, were commonly worshipped in the area and toevah appears throughout the Law to denounce these idolatrous practices. But zimmah is used wherever immoral acts such as prostitution or rape are the subject. Whatever detestable acts here are being prohibited have something to do with idolatry. This passage does not refer to gay sex generally, but only to a specific form of homosexual prostitution in Pagan temples. Much of Leviticus deals with the Holiness Code which outlined ways in which the ancient Hebrews were to be set apart to God. Some fertility worship practices found in nearly Pagan cultures were specifically prohibited; ritual same-sex behavior in Pagan temples was one such practice.\n \n When translated from Hebrew to Greek (Septuagint), the word BDELYGMA was used.. which means ritual impurity, and not the word ANOMIA, which would have meant a violation of the law or a wrong or a sin. The author was obviously meaning something different than what many Christians try to make them mean today. The verse seems to refer to temple prostitution, which was a common practice in the rest of the Middle East at that time. \n \n Another possible theory is that in modern day English this could be translated as: \"Men may not engage in homosexual sex while on a woman's bed; it is an abomination\" That is, \"rather than forbidding male homosexuality, it simply restricts where it may occur.\" This may seem a strange prohibition to us today, but was quite consistent with other laws in Leviticus which involve improper mixing of things that should be kept separate. e.g. ancient Hebrews were not allowed to mix two crops in the same field, or make cloth out of two different raw materials, or plow a field with an ox and a donkey yoked together. A woman's bed was her own. Only her husband was permitted there, and then only under certain circumstances. Any other use of her bed would be a defilement. \n \n An argument against this translation is that it would not blend well with the next verse. Leviticus 18:23 discusses a man or a woman engaging in bestiality. The traditional translations would make a smoother text. However, in defense of the above given translation, there is already a break in topic between verses 21 and 22. So a second break between 22 and 23 is not unreasonable.\n \n One more possible interpretation could be: that the operative cultural bias here is that it is an abomination to treat another man like a woman. The status of women in ancient Hebrew culture was very much lower than that of a man and barely above that of children and slaves. When a man engaged in sexual intercourse with a woman, he always took a dominant position; the woman would take a submissive posture. When two men engage in sexual intercourse, one of the men, in effect, takes the position of a woman. When a man takes on the low status of a woman, the act makes both ritually impure. It is not usual for a gay man to have sex with another man as if he the latter were a woman. If he were to do so, then he would be pretending that he was with a woman and not with another man. Thus, he would not be in a homosexual relationship at all. The passage might actually refer to a heterosexual male who is forcing himself to fantasize that he is having sex with a woman in order to be able to complete the act. In modern terms, this would be considered as a male heterosexual violating his own sexual orientation.\n \n Women were second class citizens in the Hebrew culture and were generally treated as property. If a man was penetrated in sexual intercourse he was being treated like a woman and so was degraded in the Hebrew mind. The offense was not that this was a homosexual act, the offense was that a MAN was treated like a WOMAN. If this line of thinking is correct it would serve to explain why there is no prohibition against female homosexual acts in the Old Testament. Women could not be degraded by such an act as they were already not held in high esteem. There is a theory that the Hebrew people believed in a perfect order of creation and anything that violated that order was considered unclean or an abomination. A probable example would be that fish were considered the perfect sea animal, hence anything in the sea that did not have scales and fins was unclean. (Lev. 11:9-10) Cattle were the perfect cud chewing animal, hence anything that chewed cud, but didn't have hooves was unclean. (Lev. 11:6). If this theory is correct then the prohibition against male sex acts would be violating the role of the perfect ideal human: man. It would seem to mix the sex role of the imperfect woman with the ideal role of the man. \n \n Leviticus 20:13: \"If a man also lies (Qal imperfect of shakab - to lay down with sexually) with mankind as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; (toevah - lit. - \"culturally forbidden\".) they shall surely be put to death, their blood shall be upon them.\" The passage is surrounded by prohibitions against incest, bestiality, adultery and intercourse during a woman's period. But this verse is the only one in the series which uses the religious term abomination; and it appears to be directed against temple prostitution.\n \n This verse in Leviticus prescribed the death penalty for this behavior. It really is severe. But Leviticus also prescribes the same penalty for cursing one's parents. Other sexual sins also merited the death penalty: adultery, incest and bestiality. The law in Leviticus considered all these crimes to be very serious -- but for different reasons. Cursing one's parents, for example, was a major crime against society. Israelite society of the time was built around the extended family and the operation of the whole family depended on obedience within the family hierarchy. So, to oppose one's parents was to threaten social disorder. As far as adultery, in that society the woman was the man's property and sex outside of the marriage was also a financial loss for the man... theft. The wives were bought with a \"bride's price\". It was important that any children born were legitimate heirs. \n \n As far as the reference to homogenital acts, it had a much different meaning then than it is today. Among the early Israelites, to engage in homogenital sex meant to be like the Gentiles, to identify with the non-Jews. That is to say, to engage in homogenital acts was to betray the Jewish religion. Leviticus condemned homogenital sex as a religious crime of idolatry, not as a sexual offense, and that religious treason was thought serious enough to merit death. Leviticus condemned homogenital acts as a religious crime of idolatry, not as a sexual offense. \n \n 5. Even if the reader disagrees with the theories stated above they should take note that these verses are a part of the Hebrew Scriptures often called the 'Holiness Code'. This 'code' is no longer followed by the Christian church.\n \n Let's understand that the Holiness Code of Leviticus (of which this is a part) was written primarily as a ritual manual for Israel's priests. Christians today are not bound by the rules and rituals described in Leviticus. (Gal. 3:22-25). One thing is clear from Paul's teaching: anyone who puts themselves under any one point of the Law obligates themselves to keep the whole Law (Gal. 5:3) or they are worthy of death. \n \n If Christians today insist on using this passage to condemn homosexuality, then they are also bound by the other rules and rituals described in Leviticus. \n \n Among other things, the Holiness Code of Leviticus prohibits: \n \n Sexual intercourse during a women's menstrual cycle \n \n Tattoos \n \n Wearing certain types of jewelry \n \n Eating certain kinds of meat \n \n Wearing clothing made from blended textiles (cotton-polyester blends) \n \n Cross-breeding livestock \n \n Sowing a field with mixed seed \n \n Eating or touching the dead flesh of pigs, rabbits, & some forms of seafood \n \n Men cutting their hair or shaving their beards \n \n The Holiness Code also endorses polygamy and requires Saturday to be reserved as the Sabbath. Obviously, it is unfair to use these passages to condemn homosexuality, while ignoring the fact that most Christians do not follow the rest of the rules and rituals outlined in the Holiness Code of Leviticus. \n \n 6. Judge for Yourselves: Why don't fundamentalists organize protests and picket seafood restaurants, oyster bars, church barbecue suppers, all grocery stores, barber shops, tattoo parlors, and stores that sell suits and dresses made of mixed wool, cotton, polyester, and other materials? All of these products and services are \"abominations\" in Leviticus. When have you heard a preacher condemn the demonic abomination of garments that are made of mixed fabrics? \n \n The warning is given in Leviticus 26:14-16 that \"If you do not obey me and do not carry out all of these commandments, if instead, you reject my statutes, and if your soul abhors my ordinances so as not to carry out all my commandments ...I, in turn, will do this to you: I will appoint over you a sudden terror, consumption and fever that shall waste away the eyes and cause the soul to pine away; also, you shall sow your seed uselessly, for your enemies shall eat it up.\" The list of punishments and terrors that will come from not keeping all of the commandments continues through many verses.\n \n Read what Jesus said in Matthew 7:1-5 about hypocrites who judge others. \"Do not judge lest you be judged yourselves... Why do you look at the speck in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? ...You hypocrite!\"\n \n If you have been led to misuse Leviticus and other parts of the Bible in order to condemn and hate and reject people, you are on the wrong path. Jesus quoted only one passage from Leviticus: \"You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\" (19:18). Jesus used Leviticus to teach love. Many false teachers use Leviticus and other writings to condemn, humiliate and destroy. I know which approach seems truly Christian to me. Jesus never condemned homosexuals or even mentioned anything that could be taken as a reference to sexual orientation.\n \n It is clear that the Christian church does not abide by the Holiness Code. It was a set of regulations which governed the Hebrew tribes but is not considered binding on the Christian church because there is now a NEW COVENANT IN JESUS CHRIST! The following verses talk about this New Covenant: \n \n Colossians 2:16-17 - \"Therefore let no one judge you in food or in drink, or regarding a festival or a new moon or Sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come, but the substance is Christ.\" \n \n \n \n Hebrews 8:18 - \"For on the one hand there is an annulling of the former commandment because of its weakness and unprofitableness, for the law made nothing perfect.\" \n \n Hebrews 8:13 - \"In that Christ says 'a new covenant,' Christ has made the first obsolete.\" \n \n Since the Christian church does not follow the Holiness Code it has no right to arbitrarily pick Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13-14 as still binding just because it seems to support a particular prejudice. Today we understand the dignity of women, human sexuality in general, and homosexuality in particular in ways inconceivable to the ancient priests who compiled Leviticus. As Christians, we are freed from the Law and saved by grace (Rom. 7:6; Gal. 5:4).\n \n 7. What did Jesus & the Apostle Paul say about this: Jesus in Mark 7:18-23 chided his disciples for their lack of spiritual understanding. Jesus and his disciples had been condemned by the religious leaders because they did not wash and eat according to the Law. Jesus said, \"Are you too so uncomprehending? Don't you see that whatever goes into your mouth from the outside cannot defile you; because it does not go into your heart, but into your stomach, and is eliminated?\" (Thus Jesus declared all foods clean.\"). And Jesus added, \"That which proceeds from within you, out of your heart, defiles you. Evil thoughts, abusive sex acts, thefts, murders, adulteries, deeds of coveting, wickedness, deceit, not caring, envy, slander, arrogance and foolishness: all of these evil things proceed from within and defile you.\"\n \n Paul also rejected the absolute commands of Leviticus in Colossians 2:8-23, where he said, \"If you have died with Christ to the elementary principles of the world, why, as if you were living in the world, do you submit yourself to decrees, such as, 'Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch!' (which all refer to things destined to perish with the using) in accordance with human commandments and teachings? These are matters which have, to be sure, the appearance of wisdom in self-made religion and self-abasement and severe treatment of the body, but are of no value against human indulgence.\" (2:20-23). Paul declared in 2:14 that Jesus has \"canceled out the certificate of debt consisting of decrees against us which was hostile to us; and Jesus has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross.\"\n \n 8. Clearing up some misconceptions about gays/lesbians:\n \n a. A common misconception is that gays and lesbians molest children at a far higher rate than heterosexuals. This myth has long been used to prevent gay men and lesbians from working with children. In truth, most children who are molested are molested by heterosexual men. \n \n Why don't we use the same logic that has previously, and is still applied to gay men and lesbians, to restrict heterosexual men from teaching, leading scout troops, or working in any field where they may be in close contact with children?\n \n b. Why do so many people consider AIDS/HIV to be a gay disease when: The World Health Organization reports that heterosexual contact is responsible for over 70% of all AIDS/HIV cases world wide?\n \n According to CDC statistics (July, 1997) heterosexual sex is the fastest growing mode of transmission for HIV in the United States - growing at a rate of 15 to 20 percent a year, compared to 5 percent for intravenous drug users and 5 percent for male homosexuals. \n \n Lesbians remain the least likely group of people to acquire HIV through sexual contact.",

   "Girl ESQ, you have a ridiculous mass of research supporting your position, and your articulation is excellent, as well as your debate style. nuff respect\n \n everything you said concerning the irrelevance of the old testament law and the issue of grace, I totally agree with all that. the word \"know\" in the context of Genesis 19, I still think it means \"to have sex with\", and you stated that you are open to the possibility of this definition, which would imply that the men of Sodom truly did desire homosexual relations with Lot's guests. that would make homosexuality one of the sins of Sodom. that would also mean that the men were struck with blindness because they were driven by homosexual lusts.\n \n but I leave that as \"possibly\". no debate necessary\n \n I do want to address a point that you implied at the very top of your post: \nAccording to the Bible, it is God who creates people (regardless of sexual orientation). He forms us as we are. Our genes, our temperaments, our time and place in history, our talents, our gifts, our weaknesses -- all are part of God's inscrutable and loving plan for us. So, somehow God must be behind the fact that some people are homosexual.\n\n to me it implies here that you believe people are born homosexual, or perhaps with homosexual tendancies. by extension, it implies that you believe people are born with all the tendencies of emotions and feelings that they act on.\n \n I disagree. it has not been proven that people are born with homosexual tendencies. there are a lot of studies about it that produce contradicting results. no doubt there are tons of articles that propogate the notion that homosexuality is genetic/biological/physical, but they are all based on a few experiments of questionable methods. I'll provide links later.\n \n homosexuality is the act of having sexual relations with people of the same sex. homosexuality is also the sexual attraction people of the same sex have for one another. therefore it is a feeling as well as an action based on that feeling.\n \n the thing is, homosexuals justify their actions by their feelings, and they justify their feelings by the belief that \"being gay\" is built-in\n \n first of all, if homosexual actions is based on feelings, how can it be justified? how can gays use the argument \"you cant resist your feelings\"? feelings dont control one's actions, the influence it at best, but a persons actions ultimately rests on choice. you can choose to act on your feelings or not.\n \n secondly, if it is true that \"you cant resist your feelings\", then why do we make other feelings-based actions crimes? murder and rape are considered passionate crimes, meaning that feelings had a lot to do with it. yet we incarcerate murderers and rapists because it is illegal for them to act on those feelings.\n \n moreso, if emotion-based actions can be linked to genetics/physiology/biology, then these commiters of \"passionate\" crimes are probably born with the temperament to kill or rape. how can society judge them? and if scientific research has found biological links to homosexual behavior, why arent there biological links to ALL emotion-based behavior? I hardly think that homosexuality can be the only feeling that is biologically rooted, and all other feelings are by choice...",

I am a homosexual and I am not certain why that is so. When I was a child I felt drawn towards girls when other girls were expressing interest in boys. I didn't have a name for the feelings nor was I aware they were frowned on by society until much later. I do agree that homosapiens are in control of how we act on our feelings. I feel attraction to women. Throughout my life when I have imagined falling in love, it has been a woman that I have pictured. Although I have had many close friendships with a variety wonderful men, I have never fallen in love with one. \n Almost ten years ago I met a woman who instantly took my breath away. She was elegant with a very happy smile and freckles across her cheeks. The friend introducing us thought we should meet because we were both nice people and had much in common. We had an instant rapport both intellectually and spiritually and felt compelled to spend time in each other's company. Over the years my love for her has deepened and matured. I appreciate virtually every moment I have with her. I worry about her safety and I wear my seatbelt to make her happy. I never imagined I would instinctively consider someone else's needs before my own. I take great pleasure in simple things like doing yard work on Saturday, with her on the porch drinking coffee and holding forth on some topic she just read in the paper. Yes this feels innately correct and natural. We have chosen to spend the remainder of our lives committed solely to each other. I know that we will age and that some day she may predecease me. The thought of life without her makes my heart seize with pain. Could I choose to walk away from her and ignore my feelings? Yes. But why would you ask me to do so? Why would you expect me to do so? Why would I want to do so unless it were absolutely commanded by God. What do I gain by walking away from her? Society's approval? \n \n After years of self doubt it finally occured to me to seek discernment from God and guidance from the Holy Spirit. God graciously answered my prayers. He does not disapprove and he does not expect me to break my committment and live a life without the person I love. To you I would say, point to a single place in the Bible where it says clearly, definitively and absolutely in the Hebrew, Greek, or Aramaic, that \"A woman shall only love a man and shall not love another woman\" or \"a woman must not marry another woman\" or \"a woman shall not have sexual relations with another woman.\"or \" a woman with another woman is despicaible in God's sight\" or anything even remotely close. Show me a clear prohibition on women together and if you please take it straight from the original languages and not from someone's self serving translation. I say self serving, because it was only in the last few years that I discovered without the help of a concordance, some obscure verses in Ezekiel 16:49-50 that addressed the sins of Sodom. Ezekiel 16:49-50 says, \"Behold this was the guilt of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had arrogance, abundant food, and careless ease, but she did not help the poor and needy. vs 50 Thus they were haughty and committed abominations.\" This particular reference to Sodom goes unmentioned by most Christians and is ignored in the concordance of at least three different Bibles of which I am aware. (see NASB Greek Hebrew Study Bible, NIV, Scoffield King James). You would think as these verses clearly address the sins of Sodom, that they would warrant a mention in every Bible concordance under the word Sodom. I would wager that the failure to mention Ezekiel 16:49-50 is directly related to self serving concerns that the verses would undermine the most well worn argument against homosexuals. Imagine, dictionaries would have to be altered from: \n \n sodomy< noun anal intercourse.\n DERIVATIVES Sodomize (also sodomise) < verb\n ORIGIN from latin peccatum Sodominicum 'sin of Sodom' (after the book of Genesis chapter 19, which implys that the men of the town of Sodom in ancient Palestine practiced homosexual rape)\n \n to: \n sodomy< adjective, arrogant, selfish, and lazy behavior .\n DERIVATIVES Sodomize (also sodomise) < verb\n ORIGIN from latin peccatum Sodominicum 'guilt of Sodom' (after the book of Ezekiel chapter 16, which clearly states that the guilt of Sodom was that she had arrogance, abundant food, and careless ease, but she did not help the poor and needy.\n \n \n You would also think that if homosexuality were \"one of the sins\" that caused the destruction of Sodom it would warrant a distinct mention in this list. Particularly so, if it were \"the sin\" that caused the destruction of Sodom. Ah, I hear it coming. \"but it does say abomination and every one knows when God says abomination it is a code word for homosexuality\" I ask you, why would Almighty God use a code word? If God meant to impart the idea of men having sex in men Ezekiel 16:50, I am quite certain he would have inspired Ezekiel to say so. Furthermore, if one reads Ezekiel Chapter 6 it becomes obvious that the abomination being addressed is idolatry and the worship of false Gods. \n \n The argument that all of the men of Sodom were homosexual is not even logical. God said he would not destroy Sodom if even ten righteous people could be found. If Sodom was destroyed because of homosexuality we would then have to presume that the term \"righteous \" was meant to be synonymous with non-homosexual. As the city was ultimately destroyed we also have to presume that 10 non-homosexuals could not be found in Sodom. What are the odds that every single inhabitant of Sodom was homosexual? Were there no women and if so, were all of the women lesbians? How did the city propogate itself if all of the inhabitants were homosexual? Even San Fransico with it enormous population of gay people has heterosexual inhabitants. \n \n If the city was destroyed because the crowd outside of Lot's door wanted to have homosexual sex with the angels that then must mean that the crowd was entirely male. This must be true because if women were in the crowd outside of Lot's door clamoring to have sex with the angels it would be heterosexual sex they were seeking not homosexual sex unless the angels were women. However, if the angels were women, that would of course mean that the men outside of Lot's door were not seeking homosexual sex. I guess the argument could be made that one of the angels was male and the other was female, but then that opens up a whole new theological argument regarding gender of angels and it also opens up the possibility that the men would have wanted to have sex with the female angel and the women would have wanted to have sex with the male angel thereby eliminating homosexuality entirely. Therefore, if one is to make the argument that Sodom's doom was homosexuality we must assume that the crowd outside of Lot's door was entirely homosexual males. If this is true, then either there were no heterosexual female or male inhabitants of Sodom or if they did exist, they were not outside Lot's home on that night. If there were heterosexual female and male inhabitants of Sodom, then it is likely that they numbered at least ten. So then why did God destroy Sodom if he had promised to spare the city if at least 10 heterosexuals could be found? \n \n The answer is in Ezekiel 16:49-50 \n Righteous did not mean non-homosexual.\n \n UnkerPaulie:\n \n You will notice that I have taken certain liberties with your argument. I hope you will not mind, as it is done solely for the purpose of experimentation. I have exchanged the word homo for hetero, the word same for opposite and the word gay for straight. The idea is to put the shoe on the other foot. I am assuming from your moniker, that you are a man, if not my apologies and the experiment will not work.\n \n \n \n \nI do want to address a point that you implied at the very top of your post: \n to me it implies here that you believe people are born HETEROsexual, or perhaps with HETEROsexual tendancies. by extension, it implies that you believe people are born with all the tendencies of emotions and feelings that they act on.\n \n I disagree. it has not been proven that people are born with HETEROsexual tendencies. there are a lot of studies about it that produce contradicting results. no doubt there are tons of articles that propogate the notion that HETEROsexuality is genetic/biological/physical, but they are all based on a few experiments of questionable methods. I'll provide links later.\n \n HETEROsexuality is the act of having sexual relations with people of the OPPOSITE sex. HETEROsexuality is also the sexual attraction people of the OPPOSITE sex have for one another. therefore it is a feeling as well as an action based on that feeling.\n \n the thing is, HETEROsexuals justify their actions by their feelings, and they justify their feelings by the belief that \"being STRAIGHT\" is built-in\n \n first of all, if HETEROosexual actions is based on feelings, how can it be justified? how can STRAIGHTS use the argument \"you cant resist your feelings\"? feelings dont control one's actions, the influence it at best, but a persons actions ultimately rests on choice. you can choose to act on your feelings or not.\n \n secondly, if it is true that \"you cant resist your feelings\", then why do we make other feelings-based actions crimes? murder and rape are considered passionate crimes, meaning that feelings had a lot to do with it. yet we incarcerate murderers and rapists because it is illegal for them to act on those feelings.\n \n moreso, if emotion-based actions can be linked to genetics/physiology/biology, then these commiters of \"passionate\" crimes are probably born with the temperament to kill or rape. how can society judge them? and if scientific research has found biological links to homosexual behavior, why arent there biological links to ALL emotion-based behavior? I hardly think that HETEROsexuality can be the only feeling that is biologically rooted, and all other feelings are by choice... \n\n \n Now for the experiment:\n \n From this point forward imagine resisting your feelings toward women. The next time you meet an incredible woman that you are tremendously attracted to, you must resist the urge. If you are currently in a committed relationship with a woman you are in love with, you must leave her immediately and put your feelings toward her out of your mind. \n No fantasizing about women, and no relationships with women that go beyond platonic -- EVER! You are limited to having good close women friends for the rest of your life. Unfortunately, in keeping with the rules, we must also prohibit any type of self gratification as it would undoubtly occur in conjuction with the aforementioned prohibited act of fantasizing about women. \n \n However, all is not lost, you are permitted to settle down and have a committed relationship with any man of your choosing.",

   "The following thoughts are the sermon notes of pastor John Keating, who has graciously given me permission me to share them with whomever is interested. \n \n Bible Doctrine Church\n Website: http://bibledoctrinechurch.org/\n Attn: John Keating\n 700 Munras Avenue\n Monterey, CA 93940 \n Phone: 831-394-2708 \n \n \n \n \"1. The last set of \"clobber passages\" (These are verses, we're told, where God condemns homosexuality in no uncertain terms.) are:\n \n I Corinthians 6:9: \"Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, (malakoi) nor abusers of themselves with mankind, (arsenokoites)\"\n \n Note: The Greek words translated into the English here: \"effeminate\" does not mean effeminate; and \"abusers....\" Does not mean homosexuals!\n \n \n \n I Timothy 1:9-10: v.9 - Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, \n \n v.10 - \"For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, (arsenokoites) for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;\"\n \n Note: The Greek word translated \"defile themselves....\" does not mean homosexual! \n \n \n \n 2. These two verses contain completely wrong translations to create \"homosexual ghosts\" that do not really exist! Ghosts may not hurt you, but they can make you hurt yourself! The homosexual ghosts in 1 Cor. 6:9 and 1 Tim. 1:10 were created by the inaccurate and intentionally misleading translation of two Greek words. \n \n 3. The word translated \"effeminate in 1 Cor. 6:9 is Greek malakoi and means \"soft\" or \"vulnerable.\" \"Soft\" does not mean \"effeminate.\" As we use the term today. The word is translated as \"soft\" in reference to clothing in Matthew 11:8 and Luke 7:25 and as \"illness\" in Mat. 4:23 and 9:35. It is not used anywhere else in the New Testament and carries no hint of reference to sexual orientation. The translation of malakoi as \"effeminate\" is incorrect, ignorant, degrading to women, and impossible to justify based on ancient usage compared to the meaning of \"effeminate\" today. In the early Christian church, the words were interpreted by some as referring to persons who are pliable, easily influenced, without courage or stability. Non-Biblical writings of the era used the world to refer to lazy men, men who cannot handle hard work, and cowards. Scholars have to look at material outside of the Bible in order to try and figure out just what this means. The early church Fathers used the word to mean someone who was \"weak\" or \"soft\" in their morals and from the time of the reformation to the 20th century it was usually interpreted as masturbation. In Greek this word never is applied to gay people or homosexual acts in general. \"No new textual data effected the twentieth-century change in translation of this word: only a shift in popular morality. Since few people any longer regard masturbation as the sort of activity which would preclude entrance to heaven, the condemnation has simply been transferred to a group still so widely despised that their exclusion does not trouble translators or theologians.\" (See Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality, John Boswell, University of Chicago Press, 1980, page 105-107) Our present culture has all sorts of connotations associated with the word 'effeminate' that simply don't apply\" to Paul's era. It would seem that the word \"effeminate\" can only be regarded as a mistranslation. \n \n Some Bible scholars have said that the center portion of 6:9 might be accurately translated as: \"male child abusers and the boys that they sexually abuse.\" i.e. the two behaviors probably relate to that portion of pedophiles who are child rapists, and the male children that they victimize. The verse would then refer to the crime of child sexual abuse and has no relation to homosexuality in the normal sense of the term: i.e. consensual sexual relations between adults of the same gender. \n \n It is worthwhile to check the words attributed to Jesus by the author of the Gospel of Matthew. He also had a list of sins that could bring doom on a person: Matt 15:18-20: \"...those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man. For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, and blasphemies. These are the things which defile a man...\" It is worth noting that homosexual behavior is not one of the behaviors that is mentioned in this passage. One might conclude that Jesus did not consider it important. \n \n 4. The English word \"homosexual\" is a composite word made from a Greek term (homo, \"the same\") and a Latin term (sexualis, \"sex\"). The term \"homosexual\" is of modern origin and was not used until about 100 years ago. There is no word in biblical Greek or Hebrew that is parallel to the word \"homosexual.\" No Bible before the Revised Standard Version in 1946 used \"homosexual\" in any Bible translation.\n \n 5. In various new translations we find the term homosexuals, described as:\n \n *\"men who practice homosexuality,\" (ESV); \n \n *\"those who participate in homosexuality,\" (Amplified); \n \n *\"abusers of themselves with men,\" (KJV); \n \n *\"practicing homosexuals,\" (NAB); \n \n *\"homosexuals,\" (NASB); \n \n *\"homosexual perversion,\" (NEB); \n \n *\"homosexual offenders,\" (NIV); \n \n *\"sodomites,\" (NRSV); \n \n *\"liers with mankind,\" (Rhiems); and \n \n *\"homosexual perverts.\" (TEV) \n \n \n \n Many of these entries are restricted to gay males; lesbians are often excluded. Also we find:\n \n *male prostitutes, also described as \"men kept for unnatural purposes.\" It is not clear whether the term \"male prostitutes\" (NIV, NRSV) is restricted to homosexuals or may also include men who are heterosexual prostitutes. \n \n *catamites, also described as \"boy prostitute.\" This is a young male who is kept as a sexual partner of an adult male. (Jerusalem Bible, NAB, James Moffatt) \n \n *pederasts: male adults who sexually abuse boys; an abusive pedophile or hebephile. \n \n *pervert: a person engaged in some undefined sexual perversion. (Phillips)\n \n Note: Although this is often translated by modern Bibles as \"homosexual,\" we can be fairly certain that this is not the meaning that Paul wanted to convey. If he had, he would have used the Greek word \"paiderasste.\" That was the standard term at the time for male homosexuals. We can conclude that he probably meant something different from persons who engaged in male-male adult sexual behavior.\n \n 6. The word translated as \"homosexual\" or \"sexual pervert\" or some other similar term is the Greek word arsenokoites, which was formed from two words meaning \"male\" and \"bed\". This word is not found anywhere else in the Bible and has not been found anywhere in the contemporary Greek of Paul's time. We do not know what it means. The word is obscure and uncertain. It probably refers to male prostitutes with female customers, which was a common practice in the Roman world, as revealed in the excavations at Pompeii and other sites. \"Bed\" is a euphemism for copulating. This word is extremely rare in Greek. Paul was apparently the first author to use this word. The word taken literally (male-copulator) is very ambiguous. Take, for example, the word \"lady-killer.\" Does it mean \"a lady who kills\" or \"someone who kills ladies\"? In our language it means the latter, but even then it is not clear because we do not mean that someone literally kills ladies but that their charm \"kills\" them. So taking the word \"arsenokoitai\" or \"male-copulator,\" does it mean \"a male who copulates men\"; does it mean \"a man who copulates with women\"; does it mean \"a man who is copulated?\" \n \n The Bible does not clarify. These are the only two passages in the whole Bible where this word is used... Apparently there is no known contemporaneous literature in which this word is used. However, relatively close to the time Paul wrote it was used to refer to a male copulator connected with temple prostitution. It probably had this meaning until the late fourth century after which it came to mean a lot of different things, including homosexual activity. (See The Bible and Homosexuality, Michael England and Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality, John Boswell, University of Chicago Press, 1980, page 42) \n \n Even IF the words \"malakoi\" and \"arsenokoitai\" COULD be connected with a male homosexual sex acts it STILL would not tell us WHAT KIND OF HOMOSEXUAL SEX ACT IS BEING CONDEMNED. They could refer to sex practices connected with the worship of idols, pederasty or some other sexual act which is exploitive. \n \n It is clear that the translation of these two words as \"sodomite\", \"pervert\" or \"homosexual\" has very little, if any, sound basis and is a result of homophobia.\n \n The Septuagint (an ancient, pre-Christian translation of the Old Testament into Greek) translated the Hebrew \"quadesh\" in I Kings 14:24, 15:12 and 22:46 as \"arsenokoitai.\" They were referring to \"male temple prostitutes\" - people who engaged in ritual sex in Pagan temples. 4 Some leaders in the early Christian church also thought that it meant temple prostitutes. Some authorities believe that it simply means male prostitutes with female customers - a practice which appears to have been a common practice in the Roman empire. One source refers to other writings which contained the word \"arsenokoitai:\" (Sibylline Oracles 2.70-77, Acts of John; Theophilus of Antioch Ad Autolycum). They suggest that the term refers \"to some kind of economic exploitation by means of sex (but not necessarily homosexual sex).\" Probably \"pimp\" or \"man living off of the avails of prostitution\" would be the closest English translations. It is worth noting that Much Greek homosexual erotic literature has survived, none of it contains the word aresenokoitai. \n \n Still others thought that it meant \"masturbators.\" At the time of Martin Luther, the latter meaning was universally used. But by the 20th century, masturbation had become a more generally accepted behavior. So, new translations abandoned references to masturbators and switched the attack to homosexuals. The last religious writing in English that interpreted 1 Corinthians 6:9 as referring to masturbation is believed to be the [Roman] Catholic Encyclopedia of 1967. \n \n Many would consider catamites, (a boy or young male who engaged in sexual activities with men) to be a likely valid translation for the first behavior. Such boys were often slaves, kept by rich men as sex partners. The second term might then refer to the men who engaged in sex with the catamites. That is, they are abusive pedophiles. The New American Bible 3 contains a footnote which reads: \n \n \"The Greek word translated as 'boy prostitutes' [in 1 Cor. 6:9] designated catamites, i.e. boys or young men who were kept for purposes of prostitution, a practice not uncommon in the Greco-Roman world....The term translated 'practicing homosexuals' refers to adult males who indulged in homosexual practices with such boys.\" \n \n Harper's Bible Commentary (1998) comments that the passage refers to \"both the effeminate male prostitute and his partner who hires him to satisfy sexual needs. The two terms used here for homosexuality... specify a special form of pederasty that was generally disapproved of in Greco-Roman and Jewish Literature.\" \n \n 7. When early Greek speaking Christian preachers condemned homosexuality, they did not use this word. John Chrysostom (A.D. 345-407) preached in Greek against homosexuality, but he never used this word for homosexuals, and when he preached on 1 Corinthians 6:9 and 1 Timothy 1:10, he did not mention homosexuals. See the full discussion of this in John Boswell's book: Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality - Appendix 1, \"Lexicography and Saint Paul,\" pages 335-353. \n \n 8. This incorrect rendering of malakoi and arsenokoites as references to gender orientation has been disastrous for millions of gay, lesbian, bisexual, transsexual people. This mistaken translation has enlisted a mighty army of ignorant religious fanatics against homosexual people and has turned many lesbians and gays against the Bible, and yet the true meaning of the Bible is NOT against lesbians or gays! \n \n 9. Note: Koine Greek contained no word which compares to the English noun \"homosexual\" meaning someone of homosexual orientation. In fact the word \"homosexual\" (meaning someone of homosexual orientation) was not even coined until the late 1800'S by German psychologists, and introduced into English only at the beginning of the 1900's. (See Christianity, Social Tolerance, and homosexuality, John Boswell, University of Chicago Press, 1980, page 42) However, during scriptural times there were a number of Greek words to describe homosexual sex acts and the two words \"malakois\" and \"arsenokoitai\" do not appear among them (on \"arsenokoitai\" see Boswell, pp 345-346.) \n \n 10. Conclusion: Once again the Bible (in its original languages) is clear in not condemning gays/lesbians in any shape, way, or manner!\n \n \n Bible Doctrine Church\n Website: http://bibledoctrinechurch.org/\n Attn: John Keating\n 700 Munras Avenue\n Monterey, CA 93940 \n Phone: 831-394-2708",

   "[QUOTE=Girl Esq.]The following thoughts are the sermon notes of pastor John Keating, who has graciously given me permission me to share them with whomever is interested. \n \n Bible Doctrine Church\n Website: http://bibledoctrinechurch.org/\n Attn: John Keating\n 700 Munras Avenue\n Monterey, CA 93940 \n Phone: 831-394-2708 \n \n 1. Creation, Procreation and Marriage:\n We primarily see the procreative emphasis for marriage/sex in Genesis 1-3, on which we see Paul basing his \"natural theology\" in Romans 1 and elsewhere (1 Tim 2:11-15, where we see Paul commanding women to be silent and not teach men, because Adam was created first, and Eve was deceived first; 1 Cor 11:4-16; etc.). However, while it is indisputable that God commanded Adam and Eve in Gen 1:28 to \"Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it,\" that does by no means imply that the sole, primary, or even permanent component of marriage/sex is child-bearing. On the contrary, there is nothing in the nature of this command that implies that it even has to do with a marriage relationship, other than exegesis from other texts that sexuality (thus \"increasing in number\") is to be done only within marriage relationships. For example, just several verses prior, in Gen 1:22, God similarly commanded the birds and the fish to \"Be fruitful and increase in number.\" \n \n This aspect of human nature, to \"Be fruitful and increase in number,\" is related to humanity as creatures, not humanity as image of God. There are two crucial points to understand in this regards. First, the contention that God's primary intention for marriage was procreation is not supportable from Scripture. Second, while a case can be made from the Old Testament that marriage and procreation was an assumed part of adult relationships, that assumption is overturned in the New Testament. Regarding the first allegation, that God's intention for human marriage relationships was primarily procreation, the only passages that are capable of sustaining such a belief is the Gen 1:28 verse, \"be fruitful and multiply\". However, given that this command is also spoken to the animals, it does little to support the relationship of humans to God. This description of sexuality colors it with a very primal feel, one that is instinctual in all animals and humans, and is one thing that strongly relates humans to the rest of creation: our procreative capacities, and our gender separation. However, it is by no means a reflection of our relationship to God. God is not gender separated. God is neither male nor female. While we have many texts in which God is described as He, Father, and masculine, one can also not deny the aspect of the divine feminine, such as in Proverbs 8, where Wisdom is personified as a woman, and in texts where God is nurturer and pro-creator (as in Genesis 1-2). Human male and femaleness does not personify Imago Dei, (the theology of \"the image of God which includes gender) but rather our likeness to creation. Rather, what personifies Imago Dei is our capacity to relate to one another, and to God, just as God, in the Divine Trinity, is self-relational and desires relationship with us. Just as God is faithful and loving to us, human Imago Dei is characterized by our capacity to be faithful and loving back to God, as well as faithful and loving to other people. \n \n The distinctive feature of Jehovah isn't that God is \"both\" genders, but that God transcends gender. Not even that, because the category of gender is irrelevant to the inherent nature of God. To say that God transcends gender is to imply that gender was first a category, and then Jehovah rose above it, which is clearly not the case. In humans, God \"created\" the construct of gender as a means to subdue the earth, in species propagation, which again, is what the grammar of Gen 1 seems to clearly say, and is what the church has historically supported. \n \n There is never a time when God calls Israel an adulterer for not producing offspring. Rather, Israel is called an adulterer for breaking relationship with God, and joining with other gods/nations. Neither is there a time when God condones or encourages a man to divorce his wife for not producing offspring--only for adultery. What we see of the marriage/sex relationship when God first created it in Gen. 2:23-24 is the statement that \"This [is] now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh\". What we see as the definition of the relationship is one of joining two people together, with no rationale for procreation. Again, in Gen 2:18 we read about God's intention for creating Eve for Adam: \"And the LORD God said, [It is] not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him\". God doesn't say, \"I will make the man a person with whom to make children.\" One cannot deny the reproductive capacities that God did inherently make in the female, and my intent is not to dismiss the reproductive aspect of human nature. However, God's verbal description of the relationship God initially constructed between Adam and Eve is of someone to alleviate Adam's alone-ness, not as somebody with whom to make babies. The primacy of the initial act of creating a partner for Adam was to produce relationship. \n \n One cannot deny that procreation is inherent in the nature of the male-female sexual relationship. However, the very nature of the marriage relationship seems to allow for an alternative for procreation, while the primary characteristics of marriage have no counterparts. For example, a couple that cannot produce children is capable of multiple ways of pro-creating. By engaging in community service, parenting neighborhood children when the needs arise, even adopting children, the couple can produce life from their marriage that becomes the metaphor for the life produced by biological reproduction. While they may have no children of their own, their capacity to mother/father can be expressed in many other ways than giving birth and raising their own biological offspring as they relate to, and nurture other people in their community. On the other hand, the characteristics of marriage that we actually see as foundational have no similar parallels, for example fidelity. If one fails to be capable of fidelity within the marriage, one has no \"alternatives.\" One is either faithful or one isn't. The characteristic of love, while it can be expressed in many ways, cannot be substituted. \n \n One might venture to ask why God created procreation at all if it such an insignificant part of God's intention for the marriage relationship. The answer, as we all know, is to propagate the species. For the solution to the practical problem of where to get more people (just as God did for the animals), God created the capacity for the species to self-propagate. However, the question of whether or not the initial creation of male-female was for the purpose of demonstrating the only normative unions between humans, or whether it was simply a utilitarian act to have a method of producing the human race seems somewhat self-evident. On one hand, the latter proposal is clearly true: God did create them male and female to fill the earth. If God had made \"Adam and Steve\" rather than Adam and Eve, then there would be no human race, because biological reproduction would have been impossible. However, the first proposal may or may not be true--whether the male-female sexual union is the only sexual union intended by God is a question that we cannot answer definitively, however both biological and theological evidence indicates that it is not. One clue is that while we have been given the capacity for self-propagation, this by no means obligates every creature to self-propagate. If it did, then Paul would be sinning in 1 Cor 7:1 when he encourages us not to marry (therefore denying us the capacity to propagate the species). Somewhere between Genesis 1-2, when God commands Adam and Eve to be fruitful and fill the earth, and 1 Corinthians 7:1 where Paul discourages marriage, either God changed His mind about wanting more humans wandering around on the earth, or the Genesis 1-2 passage has been mis-applied when it is used to support the idea that humans \"should\" have children, and that God's intention for marriage is for producing children. \n \n From a biological perspective, the idea that God clearly created male and female genitalia to be complementary is based on pseudoscience and not on an understanding of human anatomy and sexual physiology. The common argument from traditionalists is twofold: 1) God had one purpose in mind for sex--procreation; and 2) the male-female genital anatomy attests to the complementarity of God's intent for sex as solely for male-female/penile-vaginal sex (see Gagnon, The Bible and Homosexual Practice, 2001). \n \n 1. The most obvious argument opposed to the proposition of singular usage is that the penis was clearly designed to serve several purposes: procreation (depositing sperm), pleasure (has nerves associated with pleasure, the pudendal nerve) and for excrement of waste. One of Gagnon's primary claims to the \"obviousness\" of the misuse of the rectum for sex is that the rectum is a transport for excrement, however he fails to explain the distinction for the penis which clearly has both sex and excremental functions. \n \n 2. Further, the anal-rectal area also appears to be created for uses other than singularly for waste excretement \n \n a. It may or may not be merely coincidence that this area is the appropriate size and expandibility to accomodate a penis (similar to the vagina). Despite Gagnon's claims, the medical evidence shows that anal-rectal sex does not produce muscle or pathological tissue damage to the area. \n \n b. Just inside the male rectal canal is the prostate gland, stimulation of which heightens the sexual experience due to innervation with the pudendal nerve, the same nerve that innervates the penis. Stimulation of the anal-rectal area and the prostate gland can alone produce orgasm in the male. \n \n 3. The vagina is obviously designed for multiple purposes--procreation and pleasure (innervation by the pudendal nerve). Contrary to traditionalist theologies and patriarchal cultures (including many cultures that practice female circumcision) that have ignored the sexuality of women as irrelevant, non-existent or evil, the biological fact that the vaginal area is innervated with nerves associated with pleasure, it would seem clear that God intended the vagina to be used not just for men, but primarily for women. \n \n 4. While vaginal penetration is important to many women for sex, current research on the female orgasm is turning away from penetration as the primary stimulant for sexual arousal and satisfaction, to the clitoris, laying on the surface of the vagina, therefore not requiring penetration, indicating that God may have created women (by design) to be able to experience sexual satisfaction outside of penetrative sex. \n \n 5. Most of the authors who oppose the various forms of gay sex based on biological issues fail to address similar types of sexuality between heterosexuals, including married couples. Many actively support oral sex between heterosexuals, quite common among both heterosexuals and homosexuals. Gagnon, for instance, quotes a Rabbinical text allowing for oral sex between heterosexuals (p. 299). Further, many of these authors fail to condemn heterosexual anal sex, which many studies have shown is not an uncommon form of sexual intimacy between heterosexuals. The question then becomes why issues of \"nature\" and biology can be used to condemn homosexuality based on anatomical issues while not subsequently limiting heterosexual sex to penile-vaginal sex. \n \n A second point is that while traditional theology has assumed that marrying and having children is the obvious order of nature, this theology is mistaken. While in the Old Testament, we see little discussion of singleness (other than the mention of eunuchs, like Daniel and his cohorts), we have singleness mentioned and encouraged several times in the New Testament. (See: Mat. 19:10-12) So while in the Old Testament marriage and procreation may or may not be normative and encouraged, they are certainly neither normative, nor encouraged in the New Testament. \n \n Here we see both Jesus and Paul discouraging marriage. Paul goes on to express his acceptance of marriage, but not joyfully--he merely tolerates it, as Moses merely tolerated divorce in the Old Testament. Moreover, in Paul's acceptance of marriage, we see absolutely no mention of the procreative aspect of marriage. We see clearly that Paul views marriage as a means for sexual release (1 Cor. 7:9). As the chapter progresses, as well as in Colossians 3 and Ephesians 5 we see other aspects of Paul's view of marriage (concern, respect, love, etc), but in these immediate verses we see primarily Paul's acceptance that marriage is a means to an end: \"it is better to marry than to burn with passion.\" All of Paul's language in this passage points to a very physical, sexual nature of the marriage relationship: the reciprocal fulfilling of \"marital duties\" by each spouse (1 Cor. 7:3-5), which is clarified in the following verses, discussing that a wife's body is her husband's, and vice-versa, and that they should not deprive each other, other than briefly for prayer. There is no hint that Paul's view of marriage is one of producing children. One certainly cannot presume that Paul condemned procreation, but he apparently didn't believe that humans still retain the duty to \"be fruitful and fill the earth,\" otherwise he could not have discouraged marriage. What Paul does command within the marriage relationship is love (Eph. 5:28 and Col. 3:19), and similarly Peter commands love and respect within the marriage (1 Peter 3:7). \n \n 3. Summary of the Teleological Argument: So far I have discussed the faulty ideas that God's primary intention for marriage/sex was procreation, and that procreation as a goal is propagated in the New Testament, neither of which is true. Rather, the primary characteristics of marriage/sex seem to be a deepening and solidifying of relationship, intimacy, security, faithfulness, fidelity and mutual commitment/consent. All of these things are behaviors which strengthen humans as Imago Dei, and which separate us from most of the rest of creation. Similarly, these are all things which can be expressed in homosexual marriages, while still reflecting the Imago Dei. There is little support for the contention that God created humans primarily to propagate ourselves. Rather, it is clear from Scripture that God created humans to glorify and worship Him, and to engage Him in relationship. Nor is there support for the contention that God created marriage and sexuality for the primary purpose of bearing children only. Rather, both Paul and Song of Solomon indicate that sex was created for human pleasure, and as a method of strengthening the marriage relationship, and that marriage as an institution is still allowed so that we may not \"burn with passion\" if we are not gifted to celibacy. One of the farces of the anti-gay position, is that while they may not condemn homosexual \"feelings\" (since just as unmarried and celibate gays have sexual desires for same-gender persons, so do unmarried and celibate heterosexuals continue to have sexual feelings for opposite-gender persons), they still insist on gays living a life of celibacy, when they have provided no justification that having gay attractions are necessarily linked to the gift of celibacy (1 Cor 7:7). Contrary to heterosexuals who are unmarried and not gifted with low sexual desire who have the hope that they will one day marry a woman, those holding the anti-gay position deny that hope to homosexuals, whom God may not have gifted with celibacy. Similarly, those people who hold to the anti-gay position often hold to traditions about sexuality and marriage that they have been taught, yet haven't dug into Scripture to see what the Bible itself has to say about homosexuality, sexuality, and marriage, other than a cursory reading of the English translations. It is this lack of effort which propagates the errant belief that Scripture contains unambiguous, unilateral condemnations of homosexuality, which thereby causes the church to ostracize the very gays that they are intending to \"save\" thus becoming Sodomites to those gays: See Ezek. 16:49.\n \n 4. Marriage: One problem that some people have with homosexuality, while they may be able to accept the positive linguistic arguments above, is the fact that there are no Biblical \"models\" of a gay marriage. Therefore, they conclude, that since we have no gay married people in Scripture, but we have many examples of heterosexual marriages, that gay marriages have no Biblical basis. However, marriage is never well-defined in Scripture. In fact, even in the early church there was no unanimous way to proclaim a marriage. Marriage as a sacrament was not canonized until 1215 in the 4th Lateran Council (Boswell (1994), pg. 178). Marriage in the Greek and Roman sense was mainly a selling of the bride to the husband for the dowry. Since women had few rights, marriage was, in essence, a transfer of ownership of the daughter from the father to the husband. This was primarily the case in the upper social classes, and was a contractual affair. The lower classes did not have the contractual basis for marriages, and they were not recognized by the legal system (pg. 35). But no doubt some sort of communal acceptance of a couple's \"union\" occurred in the Greco-Roman system, even though it had no legal basis. In later Roman law marriage was recognized universally, and the rule was that \"It was not cohabitation, but consent that makes marriage,\" and \"Not coitus, but marital affection constitutes matrimony\" (pg. 51). One of the few good definitions of marriage I can find in Scripture is Genesis 2:24 - \"Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh\". But the idea that this defines marriage is only implied, it is nowhere explicated. There are no definitions for the ritual of marriage. There is no place in Scripture that says \"A couple will be considered married when thus and so occurs, or when the priest pronounces such and so.\" Thus we are left with looking to the culture in which Scripture uses the term marriage to help clarify for us what marriage entails, and to look at Biblical models for giving us guidelines on those relationships that we can infer are marriages, either from context, or by the usage of words such as husband and/or wife (i.e. Adam and Eve, Priscilla and Aquila, etc.)\n \n 5. To say that the Bible excludes gay marriages from lack of Biblical models of gay marriages is weak evidence. There is no Biblical model for using crackers, grape juice, or disposable plastic cups for communion, but many churches do so. There is no Biblical model for a \"baptismal\" in the church (while there is archeological evidence) or sprinkling, but many churches do it. There is no Biblical model for children's ministry, music ministry, or even full-time paid staff. There is no Biblical model for using sound systems, slide projectors, church vans, crosses, holy water, hymnals, etc. for worship, but many churches use them anyway. What we see churches doing, is taking the symbols that are found in Scripture, and modifying them to be relevant to contemporary society. As long as the core of the Gospel message is left unaltered, and the truths and commands found in Scripture remain intact, most Christians would have little problem with contextualization. Further, they would probably be left spiritually adrift if a church didn't contextualize.\n \n Moreover, we have several models of marriage in Scripture. In the Old Testament, we have modeled both monogamy, and bigamy. There is no hint that either form of marriage is condemned in Scripture. They both seem to be on equal footing, and the prevalence of Biblical references seems to parallel the prevalence of the type of marriage in the culture of the time. We also find examples of arranged marriages--those arranged directly by God, those arranged by the ruler of the land, and those arranged by the families of the persons involved. We see marriages that are based on economic reasons, and even slave marriages. We see examples of women who are married primarily to bear children, women who are married out of love, and the assumption that a widow should marry the closest male relative of her dead husband. There is no good evidence that any of these forms of marriage are denounced in Scripture. \n \n 6. Polygamy (many wives) and concubinage (a woman living with a man to whom she is not married) were regularly practiced in the Old Testament. Neither is ever condemned by the New Testament (with the questionable exceptions of 1 Tim. 3:2, 12 and Titus 1:6 which apply only to Pastor-Teachers and Deacons). Jesus' teaching about marital union in Mark 10:6-8 is no exception, since he quotes Gen. 2:24 as his authority (the man and the woman will become \"one flesh\"), and this text was never understood in Israel as excluding polygamy. A man could become \"one flesh\" with more than one woman, through the act of sexual intercourse. We know from Jewish sources that polygamy continued to be practiced within Judaism for centuries following the New Testament period. So if the Bible allowed polygamy and concubinage, why don't we?\n \n 7. A form of polygamy was the levirate marriage. When a married man in Israel died childless, his widow was to have intercourse with each of his brothers in turn until she bore him a male heir. Jesus mentions this custom without criticism (Mark 12:18-27). I am not aware of any Christians who still obey this unambiguous commandment of Scripture. Why is this law ignored, and the one against homosexual behavior preserved?\n \n 8. The Old Testament nowhere explicitly prohibits sexual relations between unmarried consenting heterosexual adults, as long as the woman's economic value (bride price) is not compromised, that is to say, as long as she is not a virgin. There are passages in the Song of Solomon that eulogize a love affair between two unmarried persons (see chapters 7 & 8) , though commentators have often conspired to cover up the fact with heavy layers of allegorical interpretation. In various parts of the Christian world, quite different attitudes have prevailed about sexual intercourse before marriage. In some Christian communities, proof of fertility (that is, pregnancy) was required for marriage. This was especially the case in farming areas where the inability to produce children-workers could mean economic hardship. Today, many single adults, the widowed, and the divorced are reverting to \"Biblical\" practice, while others believe that sexual intercourse belongs only within marriage. Both views are Scriptural. Which is right?\n \n 9. The Bible virtually lacks terms for the sexual organs, being content with such euphemisms as \"navel\" & \"belly\" (Song of Solomon 7:2) or \"thigh\" for the genitals, (See Gen. 24:2, 9, 32:25, 47:29) and using other euphemisms to describe coitus, such as \"he knew her.\" Today most of us regard such language as \"puritanical\" and contrary to a proper regard for the goodness of creation. In short, we don't follow Biblical practice.\n \n 10. Semen and menstrual blood rendered all who touched them unclean (Lev. 15:16-24). Intercourse rendered one unclean until sundown; menstruation rendered the woman unclean for seven days. Today most people would regard semen and menstrual fluid as completely natural and only at times \"messy,\" not \"unclean.\"\n \n 11. The conclusion I draw from this, is that the Biblical definition of marriage is reliant on cultural factors. There is no \"Biblical norm\" for marriage, other than behavioral norms \"within\" marriage. Even St. Augustine, representing ascetical early church orthodoxy \"was willing to designate as a 'wife' any woman who intended to be permanently faithful to the man she lived with\" (Boswell (1980), pg. 26). Despite his endless commands to avoid lust, and prohibitions of sexuality, he seems to admit by proxy the inability to tie Scripture down to rules of who can, and how to marry.\n \n We do, however, see many Biblical rules regarding the conduct of those who are already in a marriage. Behaviors such as love, fidelity, commitment and respect are all essential aspects to marriage. Homosexual marriages can have these equally as well as heterosexual marriages. There are no Biblical references which prohibit, or even imply a prohibition on gay marriages. The lack of gay marriage models in the Old Testament can be attributed to the lack of acceptance in the culture of the time; therefore there would be few gay married people, thus little probability that they would be modeled. In the New Testament, there are very few models of marriage (not rules for those already married, but models of who married at that time), especially compared to what we see in the Old Testament. Marriage is discussed, but rarely modeled. Homosexuality, however, was an accepted part of Greek culture. So it cannot be said that gay marriages weren't prohibited in the New Testament because they weren't known about at that time. The fact is that they were known about during that time. The emperor Nero (ruled 54-68 A.D.) had a very public marriage ceremony to another man, and at least by Juvenal's time a couple of decades later, gay marriages were commonplace (Boswell (1994), pg. 80-81). Gay marriages did exist in the common forum, yet we see no Biblical prohibitions of them. Rather, what we do see, if we take Scripture as a whole, are various models of marriage, defined only by the community who recognizes the relationship as a marriage, and by the behavioral motifs mentioned above that characterize a godly marriage. \n \n 12. The following is a list of models of marriage that I find from Genesis to Judges. The primary argument being made in this message is that the Biblical models of marriage are not clear-cut; one-man to one-woman, as many people would like to believe. Moreover, the argument that we should use the strictly Biblical models of marriage for our current behavioral motifs is found to be absurd, once we actually look at the Biblical models. Most people will find these models abhorrent and would fight them were they seriously proposed today. In each of these models, there is neither clear denunciation, nor even implication that God disapproves of them, except for Genesis 2:22, which is the primary model we use in western society (marry whomever you choose). For example there is:\n \n 1) Marriage by special creation: Adam and Eve, Gen 2.22 \n \n 2) Marriage to whomever they chose: Sons of God and daughters of men, Gen 1.1-3 \n \n 3) Marriage of a master to a slave to bear children (polygamous) Abraham and Hagar, Gen 16.1-4; (and Gen 30.3-12 for Jacob) \n \n 4) Implicit marriage by incest? Lot and his daughters, Gen. 19.30- \n \n 5) Marriage after having never met: Isaac and Rebekah, Gen. 24 \n \n 6) Marriage to upset parents: Esau to Canaanites, Gen. 28.8-9 \n \n 7) Marriage by barter and treachery: Jacob and Leah, Gen. 29.18-25 \n \n 8) Marriage by barter (polygamous): Jacob and Rachel, Gen. 29.26-30 \n \n 9) Marriage to one's aunt: Amram and Jochabed, Exod. 6.20 (Moses' parents) \n \n 10) Marriage of a slave to a woman chosen by the master. When the slave's time is up, the woman becomes the master's wife, and the slaves children becomes the master's children: Exod. 21.4-6 \n \n 11) Marriage by a conquering army of the women of the conquered country: Deut. 21.10-14 \n \n 12) If a man *dislikes* his new bride and her parent's can't prove her virginity, she is to be stoned: Deut. 22.13-21 \n \n 13) Marriage by rape: Deut 22.28-29 \n \n 14) Requirement of marriage to a dead husband's brother: Deut. 25.5-10 \n \n 15) Daughter given as a prize to a victor: Josh. 15.16-17 \n \n 16) Marriage by kidnapping: Judges 21.20-23 \n \n \n \n 13. There are several ways that appropriate sexual behavior is expressed in Scripture, other than mere procreation. Take Song of Solomon, for example. The whole book is (from a literalist perspective), a celebration of the love between a man and a woman, with a strong emphasis on sexuality. This emphasis on sexuality is not depicted as a means to produce offspring, but as a means to solidify the couple's love for each other. The sexuality described in this book is a very sensuous type of behavior, filled with passion and desire for the other person, not as a means for having children. Even in the first few verses of the book we see a celebration of sex as an apparent end to itself, or as a means to deepened intimacy: \n \n Song of Solomon 1:2-4 \" As the lily among thorns, so [is] my love among the daughters. As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so [is] my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit [was] sweet to my taste. He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me [was] love\".\n \n In the Prophets we see an aspect of marriage in the metaphors that God uses to express anger at God's people. In the book of Hosea, Hosea is commanded to marry a prostitute to symbolize through his marriage the adulterous relationship Israel has shown to God. Similarly, many times in Jeremiah we see God calling Israel an adulterer for forsaking God for idols. \n \n Hosea 3:1 \"Then said the LORD unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of [her] friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the LORD toward the children of Israel, who look to other gods, and love flagons of wine.\" \n \n Jeremiah 3:8 \"Then said the LORD unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of [her] friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the LORD toward the children of Israel, who look to other gods, and love flagons of wine.\"\n \n Jeremiah 2:2 \"Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land [that was] not sown.\"\n \n And again, we see in Jeremiah the significance of devotion in the marriage relationship.\n \n 14. Judge for Yourselves:\n \n The crux of the matter, it seems to me, is simply that the Bible has no sexual ethic. There is no Biblical sex ethic. Instead, it exhibits a variety of sexual mores, some of which changed over the thousand year span of Biblical history. Mores are unreflective customs accepted by a given community. Many of the practices that the Bible prohibits, we allow, and many that it allows, we prohibit. The Bible knows only a love ethic, which is constantly being brought to bear on whatever sexual mores are dominant in any given country, or culture, or period.\n \n The very notion of a \"sex ethic\" reflects the materialism and splitness of modern life, in which we increasingly define our identity sexually. Sexuality cannot be separated off from the rest of life. No sex act is \"ethical\" in and of itself, without reference to the rest of a person's life, the patterns of the culture, the special circumstances faced, and the will of God. What we have are simply sexual mores, which change, sometimes with startling rapidity, creating bewildering dilemmas. Just within one lifetime we have witnessed the shift from the ideal of preserving one's virginity until marriage, to couples living together for several years before getting married. The response of many Christians is merely to long for the hypocrisies of an earlier era.\n \n So we must critique the sexual mores of any given time and clime by the love ethic exemplified by Jesus. Defining such a love ethic is not complicated. It is non-exploitative (hence no sexual exploitation of children, no using of another to their loss), it does not dominate (hence no patriarchal treatment of women as chattel), it is responsible, mutual, caring, and loving. Augustine already dealt with this in his inspired phrase, \"Love God, and do as you please.\"\n \n Our moral task, then, is to apply Jesus' love ethic to whatever sexual mores are prevalent in a given culture. This doesn't mean anything goes. It means that everything is to be critiqued by Jesus' love commandment. We might address younger teens, not with laws and commandments whose violation is a sin, but rather with the sad experiences of so many of our own children who find too much early sexual intimacy overwhelming, and who react by voluntary celibacy and even the refusal to date. We can offer reasons, not empty and unenforceable orders. We can challenge both gays and straights to question their behaviors in the light of love and the requirements of fidelity, honesty, responsibility, and genuine concern for the best interests of the other and of society as a whole.\n \n Christian morality, after all, is not an iron chastity belt for repressing urges, but a way of expressing the integrity of our relationship with God. It is the attempt to discover a manner of living that is consistent with who God created us to be. For those of same-sex orientation, as for heterosexuals, being moral means rejecting sexual mores that violate their own integrity and that of others, and attempting to discover what it would mean to live by the love ethic of Jesus.\n \n Homosexual orientation has nothing to do with morality, any more than left-handedness. It is simply the way some people's sexuality is configured. Morality enters the picture when that predisposition is enacted. If we saw it as a God-given gift to those for whom it is normal, we could get beyond the acrimony and brutality that have so often characterized the unchristian behavior of Christians toward gays.\n \n Approached from the point of view of love rather than that of law, the issue is at once transformed. Now the question is not \"What is permitted?\" but rather \"What does it mean to love my homosexual neighbor?\" Approached from the point of view of faith rather than works, the question ceases to be \"What constitutes a breach of divine law in the sexual realm?\" and becomes instead \"What constitutes integrity before the God revealed in the cosmic lover, Jesus Christ?\" Approached from the point of view of the Spirit rather than the letter, the question ceases to be \"What does Scripture command?\" and becomes \"What is the Word that the Spirit speaks to the churches now, in the light of Scripture, tradition, theology, and, yes, psychology, genetics, anthropology, and biology?\" We can't continue to build ethics on the basis of bad science.",

   "The following thoughts are the sermon notes of pastor John Keating, who has graciously given me permission me to share them with whomever is interested. \n \n Bible Doctrine Church\n Website: http://bibledoctrinechurch.org/\n Attn: John Keating\n 700 Munras Avenue\n Monterey, CA 93940 \n Phone: 831-394-2708 \n \n \n 1. Rom. 1:21-28 is the next favorite weapon against gays after Leviticus. In the context of this passage, Paul is exposing the practice of the pagan rites of fertility, common in Rome and throughout the known world of the time. Paul's concern was for the Roman Christian's involvement in these fertility rites. In Corinth, where evidently a man was sleeping with his father's wife and all knew of it (1 Cor. 5:1), but did nothing about it, Paul took authority, exposing him and requiring his expulsion. Paul was writing from Corinth where there were over 1,000 religions. The most prominent were the fertility cult of Aphrodite, worship of Apollo, and the Delphi Oracle, which was across the bay from Corinth. He must have had a similar concern that the Roman Gentile believers, who had formerly been actively involved in the temple cult fertility rites, might continue to do so. Rather than a blanket condemnation of homosexuality, this passage is a slam against the hypocritical Christians who were themselves continuing to participate in the temple cult orgies. The participants were not predominantly homosexuals, but heterosexuals participating in homosexual acts. These were people who in an unbridled search for pleasure (or because of religious rituals associated with their idolatry) broke away from their natural sexual orientation, participating in promiscuous sex with anyone available. Thus, if someone began with a clear heterosexual orientation but rejected God and began experimenting with gay sex simply as a way of experiencing a new set of pleasures, then this passage might apply to them. But this is not the experience of the vast majority of gay, lesbian, and bisexual people.\n \n 2. The people Paul is describing, who are involved in this temple cult worship, have some very distinct characteristics. First, they have rejected the knowledge of God (verse 20). Second, they do not glorify God or acknowledge his provision for them and their hearts and minds have become \"darkened\" (verse 21). Third, they have exchanged the glory of God for idolatry (verses 22-23). Fourth, they degrade one another through promiscuous sexual acts (verse 24). Fifth, they have believed lies, serving created things and not the Creator (verse 25). Sixth, they have exchanged their own \"natural\" sexuality for the \"unnatural\" (verses 26-27). Seventh, they have depraved minds that promote unbridled lawlessness (verses 28-32). These are very specific characteristics and while there may be many who fit these descriptions today; this does not describe the modern mainstream homosexual community and for sure does not even come close in describing those gay men and women who are believers, serving the Lord. The problem here is that many church-goers cannot see the difference between what Paul is describing here and committed loving relationships. There is a big difference!\n \n 3. Rom. 1:18-32 (the fuller context) is a complex passage, and any quick reading of the English translations gives the clear impression that all forms of homosexuality are being condemned. However, the issue of whether or not homosexuality is sin should not rest on a quick reading of a translation. Digging into a passage, looking at patterns in and purposes of a passage as a whole is the only way that we can find out what any text is really about. This is true of Rom. 1. English translations lack a dynamic quality that is found in the original language, and obscures patterns that help us clarify the meaning and purpose of the text.\n \n 4. I come at this text in two ways. First, with the possibility that this text cannot be understood in any way other than condemning homosexuality, I look to standard hermeneutical rules, one of which is to not ground a weighty theological belief based on one passage. And that's assuming that this passage actually condemns what we call homosexuality today. I cannot say that homosexuality is necessarily sin, since there are no other texts to clarify the proper application of this doctrine. Moreover, all major theological doctrines in Christianity are built around statements that are repeated several times in Scripture: God loves, Jesus died and resurrected, Jesus is coming back, all have sinned, etc. \n \n My second approach to this passage is to try to understand what it means if it isn't a broad condemnation of homosexuality. While Romans 1:18-32 is the primary text used from the New Testament by those people who condemn homosexuality that has not always been the interpretation of this passage\n \n 5. The context of the passage makes it clear that Paul is talking about some kind of idolatrous worship. What we know about the \"mystery religions\" in and around Corinth at the time that Paul wrote Romans from Corinth fits the description in Rom. 1:26-27. \n \n 6. Paul did not write about homosexuals or about sexual orientation in any of his letters. Rom. 1:26-27 is about heterosexuals who enter into the sexual religious frenzy of fertility cult worship and demonstrate that they have abandoned God and God's purpose for their lives. In verse 26 and 27, translated to our English word \"natural\" is the Greek word phusikos which means: intrinsic; that which is born or inherent. It does not describe something that is necessarily universally true, but intrinsic for the individual. What is intrinsic for one person is not necessarily intrinsic for the next person. For example, one person may be intrinsically tall (as height runs in his/her family) while another person may be intrinsically short. Both are intrinsically influenced, but not in the same way. Both are \"natural\" in their appearance but with opposite results. Those in this passage, involved in the fertility rites, were giving themselves over to do those things that were not natural (intrinsic) to themselves. Even the English word \"nature\" means that which is inborn or inherent to the individual. The assumption here which causes so much confusion is the belief that Paul was saying that \"natural\" refers to the heterosexual persuasion; that all humans are naturally heterosexual from birth. This assumption, based on the evidence of experience does not hold true.\n \n 7. Surveys on the incidence of a homosexual orientation in identical twins were done years ago at Johns-Hopkins University. In all cases where one of the twins was homosexual, the other twin was also. More recently, in the July 26, 1993 issue of Time Magazine, the Science Editor describes recent findings that lean toward a genetic explanation for homosexuality. \"This new work and the studies of the twins are two lines of evidence pointing in the same direction. But the DNA evidence is much stronger than the twins study\", according to Simon LeVay whose research on the human brain differences is widely accepted. Science is progressively confirming what many gay men and women have known all along, they were created that way.\n \n 8. Why does Paul bring the issue up at all?\n \n In biblical times, religious uncleanness and social dishonor went hand in hand. When Paul talks of homogenitality in Romans, he seems to have the Jewish law in mind. In vs. 24, Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves: Paul raises the issue of homogenitality only as an uncleanness, such as mentioned in Leviticus. In this letter, he was speaking to the Romans and was concerned about appealing to both the Jewish and Gentile converts, without offending either of the two groups. Paul hooks the Jewish Christians on their sense of superiority over the Gentile Christians and their impurities and uses the example of Leviticus, which was not really an important issue for them. Then, Paul reels them in, pointing out their stealing, adultery, and robbing temples. His point to them was that in the face of faith in Christ and Christ's call for purity of heart, ritual behaviors and impurities do not matter. \"But he [is] a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision [is that] of the heart, in the spirit, [and] not in the letter; whose praise [is] not of men, but of God.\"\n \n Paul does not want false issues to divide them, so he insists \"I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that [there is] nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him [it is] unclean.\" (Rom. 14:14). Seen in the context of the whole letter to the Romans, the same sex reference serves a rhetorical function. It is part of Paul's' plan to win the good will of these Jewish Christian readers, then uses the same issue to make his point that the ritual requirements of the Jewish law are irrelevant in Christ. \n \n Paul mentioned that particular \"uncleanness\" of the Gentiles, because this was the one thing that they were not still arguing over. It was an obvious point of difference between them, but there was not the arguing about it as there was with the unclean foods and so forth. Thus, he could safely make his point and: 1) gain the sympathy of the Jewish Christians by seeming to side with their prejudices, 2) next show the Jewish Christians were as guilty as anyone else in breaking the Jewish law, 3) argued that in Christ the Jewish law was superseded and that above all, purity issues in the law do not matter, 4) thus incline the Jewish Christians to better acceptance of the Gentile Christians, and 5) rebuked the Gentile Christians for any superiority they might have been feeling. \n \n In Romans, Paul mentioned homogenitality to merely serve as an instance of Gentile \"uncleanness\" as judged by Jewish standards. Paul introduced this \"uncleanness\" precisely to make the point that such matters have no importance in Christ. Moreover, only if this is really the case does the whole structure of Romans make sense. Not only did Paul NOT think homogenital acts were sinful, he seems to have been deliberately unconcerned about them. In his considered treatment of the matter, he teaches that in itself, homogenital activity is ethically neutral. Instead, his purpose was to create unity between the Jewish and Gentile Christians and teach them the important things in Christ. \n \n It is ironic that to insure the unity of believers was the purpose of Paul's' writing, yet these verses serve today so often to divide and are used to condemn one's brothers and sisters. What would he think of how the verses are being used so often today? Paul insisted on faith and love as the things that really matter in Christ, but by misunderstanding Paul's argument, people unwittingly rely on tastes and customs instead of the word of God. They argue about what's dirty or clean, dispute who's pure and impure, and pit heterosexual against homosexual. Thus, they divide and splinter the church over what does not matter in Christ. They commit a grave injustice, the very offense that Paul's' letter meant to counter.\n \n \n \n 9. Here is a full, exegetical breakdown of last half of Romans 1:\n \n \n \n Rom 1:18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;\n \n \n \n Rom 1:19 Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; (Hellen - translated as Greeks, specifically referring to all non-Jews.) for God hath shewed [it] unto them.\n \n \n \n Rom 1:20 For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, [even] his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:\n \n \n \n Rom 1:21 Because that, when they knew God, they glorified [him] not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.\n \n \n \n Rom 1:22 Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,\n \n \n \n Rom 1:23 And changed (metallasso - this word refers to a substitution of one thing in place of another) the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.\n \n \n \n Rom 1:24 Wherefore God also gave them up (paradidomi - this word refers to God allowing the natural course of events to occur from the behavior initiated by the Gentiles) to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:\n \n \n \n Rom 1:25 Who changed (metallasso) the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.\n \n \n \n Rom 1:26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: (atimia - It means something \"not highly valued, \"not held in honor\", \"not respected\". Socially unacceptable\" also conveys the meaning of the word and is the very sense in which Paul uses it. For example, in 2 Cor. 6:8 and 11:21, Paul applies that word to himself. He notes that he is sometimes held in disrepute or shame because of his commitment to Christ. Evidently then, to be labeled atimia is not necessarily a bad thing. Again, in 1 Cor. 11:14 Paul uses the word to suggest that it is \"degrading\" for a man to wear long hair. Even though Paul says this is what \"nature\" teaches, it is clear that no ethical judgment is intended. In none of the cases in which Paul uses the word does the word express a moral judgment. So, when Paul calls certain passions \"degrading\" in Rom. 1:26, he is not saying that they are wrong, only that they do not enjoy social approval.) for even their women did change (metallasso) the natural (phusikos - which means: intrinsic; that which is born or inherent. It does not describe something that is necessarily universally true, but intrinsic for the individual. What is intrinsic for one person is not necessarily intrinsic for the next person.) use for that which is against nature: (physis - The term \"against nature\" is also strange here, since exactly the same term is used by Paul in Rom. 11:21-24 to speak of God acting \"against nature\" by including the Gentiles with the Jews in the family of God. \"Against nature\" was used to speak of something that was not done in the usual way, but did not necessarily mean that something \"against nature\" was evil, since God also \"acted against nature.\")\n \n For Paul, the \"nature\" of something was its particular character or kind. In Rom. 2:14, Paul speaks of Gentiles who follow their own conscience and \"do instinctively (PHYSEI) what the law requires.\" But, the Greek text reads \"by nature\", and the implication is that these Gentiles act as is consistent with the kind of persons they are. For Paul, something is \"natural\" when it responds according to its kind, when it is as it is expected to be. For Paul, the word \"natural\" does not mean \"in accordance with natural laws.\" Rather, \"natural\" refers to what is characteristic, consistent, ordinary, standard, expected, and regular. When people acted as expected, they were acting \"naturally\". When people did something surprising, something unusual, something beyond the routine, they were acting \"unnaturally.\" That was the sense of the word \"nature\" in Paul's usage.\n \n \n \n Rom 1:27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural (phusikos) use of the woman, burned (Paul never used this word anywhere else and its meaning is uncertain) in their lust (ekkaio en autos orexis - literally means \"utterly consumed by fire\", describes a behavior which has nothing to do with a normal, monogamous relationship. This kind of lust is one that grows to control all of one's thoughts and is insatiable. This is not the kind of simple longings and drives described earlier in the passage (\"lusts\"/epithumia\";\"uncleanness\"/akatharsia\",v.24; \"vile affections\"/atimias pathos\", v. 26, NIV), but describe an all consuming force which takes control and destroys. He did not use the word eros here which means romantic love and never appears in the N.T. \"Passions\" in 1:26 probably refers to the frenzied state of mind that many ancient mystery cults induced in worshipers by means of wine, drugs and music. While this type of phenomenon can admittedly be found in some homosexual relationships, it is by no means limited to homosexual relationships, and it is certainly not typical of homosexual relationships (despite what some tenets of the media would like us to believe). So this is a further exclusion of this passage from referring to all homosexual relationships.) one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, (Some translations use \"indecent\" or \"shameful horrors\" here. The Greek word here is askemosunen and is formed of the word for \"outer appearance\" plus the negative particle. Literally, the word means \"not according to form\". Again, by using these words he makes no ethical condemnation of homosexuality. He merely points out social disapproval of it. For all of the words Paul used, there were other words that he could have chosen that DO mean \"ethically wrong\", but they were intentionally never used to describe homosexual behavior. It speaks of the inner or hidden part or parts of the individual that are not ordinarily seen or known in public. \"Indecent\" in 1 Cor. 12:23 referred to the parts of the body that remain hidden but are necessary and receive honor. 1 Cor. 13:5 used the word to say that love does not behave \"indecently.\" \n \n This word for \"indecency\" was used to translate Deut. 24:1 into Greek to say that a man could divorce his wife if he \"found some indecency in her.\" The religious teachers argued endlessly about what \"some indecency\" meant. Some said it was anything that displeased the husband. Others were stricter and said it could only refer to adultery. In Mat. 19:1-12, Jesus commented on Deut. 24:1-4, but he did not define the term. \n \n Paul was certainly aware of the variety of ways that the teachers interpreted the word \"indecency,\" and he used it in a variety of ways himself. To read into \"indecent acts\" a whole world of homosexual ideas is to abandon the realities of objective academic study and to embark on useless and damaging speculation that cannot be supported by the meaning of the word or by Paul's use of it elsewhere.) and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.\n \n \n \n Note: There are several reasons that lead me to believe that this passage is not condemning all homosexual behavior, but is only condemning temple prostitution/idol worship. First, when looking at the structure of the passage, it seems clear, from a conservative interpretation, that the sin in verses 26b-27 must be somehow related to some concrete form of idolatry, not an abstract concept that describes all homosexual behavior. Rather, the concrete form of idolatry that fits in with the structure of the parallelism, yet also conforms to the homosexual content of the passage, seems to clearly indicate that Paul's intent was to solely condemn homosexual cultic temple prostitution. Second, even without trying to conform to the parallelism, one can see that the primary issue of chapter one is that idolatry leads to abandoning the belief in God. The third parallel shows that whatever kind of sexual behavior is referred to, it causes them to stop believing in God (vs 26b-28). However, there is a huge population of gays and lesbians who believe in God. These are not people who claim to believe in God, & live lives of promiscuity, etc. Rather, these are people who are either celibate gays (looking for a monogamous, long-term relationship), or are in monogamous, long-term homosexual relationships, but who also have strong beliefs in and love for the God of the Bible, and who have a strong commitment to obeying the teaching of Scripture. In the absence of such models, it would be much easier to accept that Romans 1:18-32 claims that all homosexuality is sin, because it would then be obvious that since no homosexuals believed in God, therefore verses 26-27 refer to all homosexual behavior. However, since there are many gay/lesbian Christians who have a strong belief in God, then it becomes obvious that verses 26-28 cannot refer to all homosexual behavior; otherwise Scripture would be in error. The final two reasons why I believe this passage is not referring to all homosexual behavior, especially behavior that can be applied to today's culture, is the fact that Paul ties the homosexual behavior to natural theology, which, in other cases of Paul's teachings, seems to limit those doctrines to Paul's own culture, and to the fact that Paul further limits the behavior described in these verses to behavior characterized by an all-consuming, destructive passion (lust). \n \n If Paul had intended to condemn homosexuals as the worst of all sinners, he certainly had the language skills to do a clearer job of it than emerges from Romans 1:26-27. The fact is that Paul nowhere condemned or mentioned romantic love and sexual relations between people of the same sex who love each other. Paul never commented on sexual orientation. As in the rest of the Bible, Paul nowhere even hinted that Lesbians and Gay men can or should change their sexual orientation.\n \n The use of Romans 1:26-27 against homosexuals turns out to be a blunt instrument to batter and wound people who were not intended in the original text. Paul clearly taught throughout Romans, Galatians and his other letters that God's freely given and all inclusive love is for every person on earth. Notice what Paul said about judging others in Rom. 2:1: \"Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.\"\n \n \n \n Rom 1:28 And even as they did not like to retain God in [their] knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;\n \n \n \n The most likely cult that Paul was referring to was the Cybelean/Attic mystery cult, which was one of the most prominent cults in Rome, and had a history going back several hundred years in the region. The priests and priestesses, called galli, attempted to achieve gender neutrality in service to their god/dess. The goal was to transcend gender in order to become more like Attis (the father God, son/lover of Cybele) and Cybele (the mother goddess). Attis was castrated and Cybele was a virgin. Both were sexually active in the myth (many of Cybele's counterparts were known as a fertility goddess), but engaged in sexual acts that could not produce children. In order to become more like their gods, all galli voluntarily castrated themselves, and were involved in ritual sexuality with the worshippers that would come to the temple.\n \n \n \n Rom 1:31 Without understanding, covenant breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:\n \n \n \n SPECIAL NOTE on Romans 1:31, where the King James Version translated the Greek word astorgous as \"without natural affection.\" This is one of the characteristics of people \"with a reprobate mind\" (KJV of 1:28). The word for \"reprobate\" is more recently translated as \"depraved\" or \"perverted\" in order more neatly to fit the sexualizing of everything possible in the list. The literal meaning of \"reprobate\" (Greek dokimon) is \"to fail to measure up\" or \"to fail to meet the test\" and simply means that the list of things that follows is the result of a mind that has abandoned God. The word astorgous, \"without natural affection,\" is used only here and in 2 Tim. 3:3. It has nothing at all to do with homosexuality or with sex. It is the Greek word for \"family love\" or \"family ties\" with the negative prefix. It refers to people who despise and reject their family members. Rather than being directed at homosexuals, it is a term that is directed at people who despise and reject their own homosexual children and brothers and sisters! Modern translators, knowing this, usually render the word as \"unloving,\" and the implication of some sort of \"unnatural\" or \"perverted\" affection is removed. Many more translation corrections are needed elsewhere! \n \n \n \n Here is a brief comparison of verses in Romans 1 with galli practices:\n \n vv. 21-22 - The galli claimed to tell people's fortunes, but everybody thought were mad, the way they danced around and cut themselves. The Greek texts talk about the \"mania\" of their rituals. \n \n \n \n v. 23 - The Cybele's temple statues were of Attis, Cybele (and others), who were always surrounded by other images of animals, particularly lions and snakes. In addition, the galli's temples were always filled with doves, because the galli thought they were too holy to touch, to shoo them away. The fact that all of these animals were normative in the Cybelean temples and Paul mention them by name, makes it highly likely that Paul was specifically referring to this cult in Romans 1.\n \n \n \n vv. 26-27 - One of the primary ideas of the galli was to remove gender differences. This occurred through transvestitism, and physically cutting off one's genitals. Part of this was also assuming the sexual characteristics of the opposite gender, so the male galli would serve sexually \"as women\" to male worshippers in the temple. Women were known to cut off their breasts and have lesbian relationships to transcend their gender. Women had sex with men too, but in order to avoid pregnancy, again like Cybele, they would have anal sex, not vaginal (some early church fathers, like Clement and Augustine, indicate that the female behavior referred to in these verses is not female-female behavior, but female-male sexual behavior in a manner which disallowed pregnancy--see below for a fuller explanation). \n \n \n \n This seems to have been the view of the early church. Hippolytus, a Christian martyr and church leader in the early part of the 3rd century, ties the Cybelean rituals with the Romans passage. In Refutation of All Heresies, Book V, he describes both the Cybelean (\"mother of the gods\")/,Attis cults and the Naassenes, a Gnostic group. \n \n \n \n But if the mother of the gods emasculate Attis, and herself has this person as an object of affection, the blessed nature of the supernatural and everlasting alone recalls the male power of the soul to itself. For (the Naassene) says, there is the hermaphrodite man. According to this account of theirs, the intercourse of woman with man is demonstrated, in conformity with such teaching, to be exceedingly wicked and filthy. For, says the Naassene, Attis has emasculated himself and has passed over from the earthly parts of the nether world to the everlasting substance above, where thre is neither female or male, but a new creature, a new man, which is hermaphrodite. [at which point Hippolytus quotes Romans 1.20-23 as an introduction, then skips directly to 1.26-27, poignantly emphasizing Paul's purpose in this passage of Scripture].\n \n \n \n v.28 - the verb - poieo - translated as 'to do' when it explains a verb, is called the epexegetical infinitive, and explains what Paul means by \"God gave them up to a reprobate mind.\" The list of unseemly acts follows.\n \n \n \n Thus, the acts listed in vs. 26b-27 (which are the cultic homosexual prostitution acts) are part of the ultimate cause of God giving them over, not the result of God giving them over. This makes them clearly separate from the acts listed in v. 29-31, which are the result of God having given them over, and clearly not the cause. Having grammatically separated what is cause and what is result in this passage, it is easy to see that the homosexual acts must be separate entities from the sin-list and therefore were intended to be interpreted in the context of the three-clause, metallasso/ paradidomi system, and not as part of the sin-list. \n \n 10. The indictment of homosexuality in Rom. 1:26-27 is linked to the preceding argument against idolatry through the repetition of the word \"change\" or \"exchange\" which is used three times. Paul states, first of all, as a general principle the Jewish conviction that Gentile religion is corrupt because it substitutes (\"exchanges\") the glory of God for the veneration of images of mortal beings. Gentile religion \"changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.\" (1:23). The sequence \"corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.\" echoes Gen 1:26 which says that the human being will have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, over the cattle, and over the reptiles. The appeal to Gen 1:26 serves Paul to emphasize that in the fatal substitute of the true God for images, the human being idolizes the very animals which in the story of creation were to be subject to human dominion.\n \n 11. The first \"exchange\" of legitimate for illegitimate worship is followed by a second in which the moral implications are also introduced. Gentiles \"changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator\" (1:25) which is the reason that God gives them up to their own desire leading to the degrading of their bodies (1:24). The phrase \"to dishonour their own bodies\" in the second mention of the \"exchange\" is not specific. In the third step involving the \"exchange\", however, the specificity is palpable: \"for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly...\"(1:26-27). There are three parallel thoughts between verses 23-28. Parallelism, (the use of the same word in several places) is extremely common in the Hebraic and Greek literature, and involves repeating a thought in a different way for emphasis. Paul often used this common device of emphasis, and it is clear from the structure of this passage that Paul is using this technique to emphasize God's wrath against the sin of idolatry.\n \n He begins in verses 18-20 by showing the readers that there is some part of God's character (\"...when they knew God, they glorified [him] not as God, neither were thankful...\") that can be seen in creation itself, apart from the special revelation found in Scripture. Thus, even Greeks are without excuse as far as to whom they should direct their worship. Moreover, we are told that these Greeks did actually know God from creation, however \"...when they knew God, they glorified [him] not as God, neither were thankful...\". These Greeks, and Paul was specifically referring to all non-Jews (see v. 16 for Paul's breakdown of people-groups for this chapter: there are Jews, and then there is everybody else (Hellen - translated as Greeks in the KJV,) were engaged in human philosophies (Stoicism, etc) and religions which sought to understand and worship creation apart from the Creator. Though they at one time knew God (v. 21), they eventually ended up in the position that they \"...did not like to retain God in [their] knowledge..\". Paul shows us in this chapter that this progression of not glorifying God as God to abandoning the concept of God leads to any number of sinful behaviors (murder, etc), as described in the last several verses of the chapter (1:29-31). Finally, we see that while somehow these Gentiles knew the laws of God, and knew that breaking these laws deserve death; they not only practiced these behaviors, but approved of others who did the same (v. 32).\n \n That is the general outline of the chapter. The primary focus of the chapter is on Gentiles who stop worshipping God, and who \"exchange/substitute\" (metallasso) the worship of God for the worship of idols. While one could easily postulate that the substitution here could be extended metaphorically to anything which takes our focus off of God (human philosophies, busy-ness, religiosity, etc.), Paul's language here seems to limit us specifically to explicit idol worship. Both of the first two parallel passages (vs. 23-24, 25-26a), which are clearly bounded by the repeated phrases \"they changed\" (metallasso - this word refers to a substitution of one thing in place of another) and \"God gave them up\" (paradidomi; this word refers to God allowing the natural course of events to occur from the behavior initiated by the Gentiles--God didn't \"cause\" them to have the \"lusts\" (v. 24), \"vile affections\" (v. 26a) or \"a reprobate mind\" (v. 28), but when the Gentiles abandoned God, paradidomi implies that God stepped back and allowed the natural course of events to happen) very graphically describing idol worship as it would have been found in Greek and Roman cultic rituals of the time of Paul's writing. \n \n 10. If one allows that the things being exchanged in vs. 23 and 25 are metaphors for anything which draws us away from God, then one can easily say that the sexual behaviors described in vs. 26b-27 describe general homosexual behavior. However, it seems like a poor handling of the texts to allow for such a metaphorical meaning, when the texts are so explicitly concrete in their descriptions of cultic idolatry \"an image made like to corruptible man\" and \"worshipped and served the creature\". In the same way, in order to preserve the symmetry of the parallel verses, one would be safest to conclude that the third parallel similarly refers to cultic idolatry. The fact that homosexual conduct is described in this regard makes sense when one realizes that homosexual temple prostitution was a common phenomenon of cultic idolatry rituals in the geographic location and time in which Paul was writing. Taking this interpretation of Rom. 1:26b-27 preserves the symmetry inherent within the text. \n \n 12. The only way to make this text refer to all homosexual behavior as opposed to merely cultic temple prostitution is to either rip it from its context, or to take a liberal interpretation of the text and make the three parallels metaphorical instead of literal. This is especially clear when one looks closer at the structure of the third parallel, and compares that to the other two parallels. I might note that close analysis of the structure is an appropriate technique to use with Paul. Paul was not ignorant of the rhetoric of the day, nor was Paul careless with his words. Paul was a master craftsman when it came to language, and all of his letters show a great attention to detail and structure. At any rate, within the first two parallels, we see that God gave them over to evil behaviors because of certain actions they took (\"changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image\", and then worshipping and serving created things rather than the creator). God does not necessarily give them over because of what they have exchanged, but because of the actions taken because of the exchanges (in the second parallel, they have exchanged the truth of God for a lie, but the resulting action is that they \"worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator\"). In the third parallel, they exchange natural relations (phusikos chresis) for those which are against nature (para phusis - In the cultural backdrop of Judaism, the primary reason for sex was procreation. Any sexual acts which did not work to fulfill this goal was para phusis. Paul's argument \"from nature,\" rather than universalizing his case to all places and all times, seems to do the opposite, and limits the consequences of issues tied to natural theology to Paul's own time and culture. Similarly with the homosexual descriptions in Romans 1:26-27, even if the behaviors mentioned there didn't already seem to be limited to cultic temple prostitution by the context of the triple parallelism, Paul's linking the behavior to natural theology seems to further limit it, and calls into question its relevance for today's culture. In ancient Greece and Judaism, since women were little more than property, there were strict sex-roles that had to be maintained. Any show of dominance of a woman, or passivity of a man was an \"exchange\" that was \"against nature.\") as described in verses 26b-27. However, it was not those exchanges which led to God giving them over. Those exchanges resulted in verse 28, \"...they did not like to retain God in [their] knowledge...\", which is what caused God to give them over. It was not the sexual behavior which caused God give them over, but their abandoning their belief in God which caused Him to give them over. The sexual behavior was a key part of the process of them rejecting belief in God, just as making idols, and worshipping/serving idols was a key part of the process in verses 23-26a. As in the first two parts, we see that God has given them over to wicked behavior (v. 28). However, in both of the first two parts we see that what they exchanged were clearly idolatrous behaviors, while in the third part, we see sexual behaviors being exchanged/substituted. This is the primary difficulty with this text.\n \n 13. Summary of Evidence: Finally, after the positive evidence given above, I would like to point out some negative evidence. First, Jesus never mentions homosexuality. Of all the things Jesus talked about, including sexual mores, if it were an important issue to Him, I would think the writer of at least one of the four Gospels would have written it down. Second, the New Testament seems to be rather sloppy in its condemnation of homosexuality if it is in fact being condemned, given that the only words it uses are open to broad interpretation (\"soft\", \"child molester\", and idolatrous, lust-related sex acts), rather than existing Greek words that clearly refer to homosexuality, such as arrenomanes or erastes. Further, the I Cor. 6:9 usage of the juxtaposed terms arsenokoitai and malakos has been seen by some commentators as a prohibition of both active and passive roles in the homosexual act. This usage is inappropriate, however, because neither term has such a connotation for this usage in any other Greek source. Moreover, there were already specific juxtapositions used to refer to these two roles of homosexuality, namely drwntes and paschontes, or paiderastai and paidika. Thus the argument that Paul created these terms for lack of better terms has no linguistic support. \n \n To summarize the above evidence, there are three primary reasons why I have become convinced that homosexuality is not sin. First, the linguistic and cultural evidence, allows me to accept the proposition that homosexuality is not condemned in Scripture from an intellectual perspective. Each of the relevant Scriptural passages that allegedly condemn homosexuality are found to be NOT referring to homosexuality at all, & are found in a context which makes them irrelevant to loving, committed homosexual relationships, or are simply mistranslations. Second, if God wanted to condemn all homosexuality, God blatantly failed to do so for the first 4000 years of history considering that there is not the slightest hint of condemnation for lesbianism, only for male homosexuality, even though lesbianism existed at the time of the writing of the Old Testament, and that in verses contiguous with the prohibitions on male homosexuality, there are specific female sexual behaviors that are similarly prohibited (which counters the argument that the O.T. ignores female morality, and thus would not address lesbianism). The obvious conclusion from this is that God's intent was not to condemn all homosexuality, only a form of male homosexuality that either makes those individuals ritualistically unclean or were active forms of pagan idolatry. It makes no sense for God, who in the New Testament shows us the inadequacy of the Old Testament Law, to add new Laws on top of the old Laws by suddenly including lesbianism in the list of prohibited behaviors, as is alleged to be the case in Romans 1. Finally, Jesus makes it exceedingly clear that all of the Law and the Prophets are summarized in two commands: Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind, and Love your neighbor as yourself (Matt 22:36-40). Neither of these two commands are violated by homosexual marriages, anymore than they are in heterosexual marriages. Homosexual Christians are no less apt to engage in behaviors which clearly exhibit the characteristics of these two commands, or of the fruits of the Spirit (Gal 5:22-23) than are heterosexual Christians. Therefore, I find no Scriptural evidence for the traditional Evangelical allegation that homosexuality is sin. \n \n It is based on the brief presentation of the summary evidence above that I have concluded that homosexuality is not sin. We are told that \"love comes from God\" (1 John 4.7). If this is true, and the love between a man and a woman in a long-term, committed relationship is truly love (which we can assume that logically flows from God), then why would not the love between a man and a man, or a woman and a woman in a similar relationship not also be from God? I contend that it is from God, and that God blesses homosexual relationships as God does heterosexual relationships",

I'm not saying that homosexuality was the only sin the sodomites commited, nor were they the only city that practiced homosexuality (if they did), nor that homosexuality was the damning sin that caused God to vent his wrath. however, homosexuality would be a sin the sodomites would have been guilty of (if \"know\" = \"have sex with\"), and the word \"sodomy\" would be deserving of its root\n \n anyway, your entire analysis of the new testament falls because you insist that 1) homosexuals are \"born that way\" and 2) God approves of all \"love\", no matter where or how it is expressed\n \n 1) I mentioned in my previous post as well as in the other thread (\"I dont get it\" in the Gay Rights forum) that homosexuality, and all other feelings-based emotions have nothing to do with genetics/physiology/biology. firstly, feelings dont control actions, choices do. you always decide whether to act on your feelings or not, so clearly feelings is not a controlling factor. secondly, no scientific experiment has ever conclusively linked a particular behavior to any genetic, physical or biological attribute. behavior and genetics so far have absolutely no links\n \n 2) the Bible says \"the love of money is the root of all evil\". the word love in this context is no different from \"love thy neighboor as thyself\", yet it is quite obvious that God does not approve of the love of money, nor of evil. love is a very versatile quality, people can love just about anything, and it is real love, real affection, expression of the same self-sacrifice and mental preoccupation. but when you love money like this (as well as a lot of other things mentioned in the Bible) then God expressly does not approve of it\n \n be careful of your statement \"love comes from God\"... God does not approve of homosexuality",

   "UnkerPaulie, \n \n My apologies. In my haste to respond to the topic ( I was at work and on my way into a meeting), I was remiss in properly attributing the argument in my post to the man responsible for it. Although I am in complete agreement with the exegesis, interpretation and data propounded, the thoughts expressed are those of Pastor John Keating, who has graciously permitted me to share them with whomever is interested. \n \n \"John Keating was born in 1946 and born again in 1966.

Pastored the Rockwood Bible Church, St. Louis MO and now Pastor of Bible Doctrine Church.\" \n \n http://bibledoctrinechurch.org\n \n Bible Doctrine Church\n Website: http://bibledoctrinechurch.org/\n Attn: John Keating\n 700 Munras Avenue\n Monterey, CA 93940 \n Phone: 831-394-2708 \n \n \n This is my own personal response to your thoughts on whether homosexuals are born so. I am a homosexual and I am not certain why that is so. When I was a child I felt drawn towards girls when other girls were expressing interest in boys. I didn't have a name for the feelings nor was I aware they were frowned on by society until much later. I do agree that homosapiens are in control of how we act on our feelings. I feel attraction to women. Throughout my life when I have imagined falling in love, it has been a woman that I have pictured. Although I have had many close friendships with a variety wonderful men, I have never fallen in love with one. \n Almost ten years ago I met a woman who instantly took my breath away. She was elegant with a very happy smile and freckles across her cheeks. The friend introducing us thought we should meet because we were both nice people and had much in common. We had an instant rapport both intellectually and spiritually and felt compelled to spend time in each other's company. Over the years my love for her has deepened and matured. I appreciate virtually every moment I have with her. I worry about her safety and I wear my seatbelt to make her happy. I never imagined I would instinctively consider someone else's needs before my own. I take great pleasure in simple things like doing yard work on Saturday, with her on the porch drinking coffee and holding forth on some topic she just read in the paper. Yes this feels innately correct and natural. We have chosen to spend the remainder of our lives committed solely to each other. I know that we will age and that some day she may predecease me. The thought of life without her makes my heart seize with pain. Could I choose to walk away from her and ignore my feelings? Yes. But why would you ask me to do so? Why would you expect me to do so? Why would I want to do so unless it were absolutely commanded by God. What do I gain by walking away from her? Society's approval? \n \n After years of self doubt it finally occured to me to seek discernment from God and guidance from the Holy Spirit. God graciously answered my prayers. He does not disapprove and he does not expect me to break my committment and live a life without the person I love. To you I would say, point to a single place in the Bible where it says clearly, definitively and absolutely in the Hebrew, Greek, or Aramaic, that \"A woman shall only love a man and shall not love another woman\" or \"a woman must not marry another woman\" or \"a woman shall not have sexual relations with another woman.\"or \" a woman with another woman is despicaible in God's sight\" or anything even remotely close. Show me a clear prohibition on women together and if you please take it straight from the original languages and not from someone's self serving translation.\n\n Remember, sex outside of the sanction of marriage is against God's approval, whether it is hetero or gay couples. so unless you are married, the question of sex is sin is already a given.\n \n I really cant help you concerning Greek, Hebrew or Aramic versions of the scriptures, I dont have access to them, and even if I did I dont know the languages. but here are some scriptures to work with:\n \n Gen 2:24, 25 - Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh. And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.\n \n Numbers 5:29 - This is the law of jealousies, when a wife goeth aside to another instead of her husband, and is defiled;\n \n Romans 1: 26-28 - For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. Their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural, and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in their own persons the due penalty for their error. And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a base mind and to improper conduct\n \n 1 Corinthians 6:9,10 - Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither the immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor sexual perverts, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor robbers will inherit the kingdom of God.\n \n 1 Corinthians 7:2 - But because of the temptation to immorality, each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband.\n \n Ephesians 5:22 - Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.\n \n Hebrews 13:4 - Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled; for God will judge the immoral and adulterous. \n \n OK, so maybe I cant find a specific instance where the Bible explicitly prohibits women having sex with women (Romans 1 is very very close though), it does convey that marriages between male and female are the only relationships that He condones (in terms of sex). \n \n but do you really think that the absence of that specific command written that way means that God approves of it? If you are truly trying to justify a homosexual relationsip, why go to the Bible for confirmation?\n \n \n I say self serving, because it was only in the last few years that I discovered without the help of a concordance, some obscure verses in Ezekiel 16:49-50 that addressed the sins of Sodom. Ezekiel 16:49-50 says, \"Behold this was the guilt of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had arrogance, abundant food, and careless ease, but she did not help the poor and needy. vs 50 Thus they were haughty and committed abominations.\" This particular reference to Sodom goes unmentioned by most Christians and is ignored in the concordance of at least three different Bibles of which I am aware. (see NASB Greek Hebrew Study Bible, NIV, Scoffield King James). You would think as these verses clearly address the sins of Sodom, that they would warrant a mention in every Bible concordance under the word Sodom. I would wager that the failure to mention Ezekiel 16:49-50 is directly related to self serving concerns that the verses would undermine the most well worn argument against homosexuals. Imagine, dictionaries would have to be altered from: \n \n sodomy< noun anal intercourse.\n DERIVATIVES Sodomize (also sodomise) < verb\n ORIGIN from latin peccatum Sodominicum 'sin of Sodom' (after the book of Genesis chapter 19, which implys that the men of the town of Sodom in ancient Palestine practiced homosexual rape)\n \n to: \n sodomy< adjective, arrogant, selfish, and lazy behavior .\n DERIVATIVES Sodomize (also sodomise) < verb\n ORIGIN from latin peccatum Sodominicum 'guilt of Sodom' (after the book of Ezekiel chapter 16, which clearly states that the guilt of Sodom was that she had arrogance, abundant food, and careless ease, but she did not help the poor and needy.\n \n \n You would also think that if homosexuality were \"one of the sins\" that caused the destruction of Sodom it would warrant a distinct mention in this list. Particularly so, if it were \"the sin\" that caused the destruction of Sodom. Ah, I hear it coming. \"but it does say abomination and every one knows when God says abomination it is a code word for homosexuality\" I ask you, why would Almighty God use a code word? If God meant to impart the idea of men having sex in men Ezekiel 16:50, I am quite certain he would have inspired Ezekiel to say so. Furthermore, if one reads Ezekiel Chapter 6 it becomes obvious that the abomination being addressed is idolatry and the worship of false Gods. \n \n The argument that all of the men of Sodom were homosexual is not even logical. God said he would not destroy Sodom if even ten righteous people could be found. If Sodom was destroyed because of homosexuality we would then have to presume that the term \"righteous \" was meant to be synonymous with non-homosexual. As the city was ultimately destroyed we also have to presume that 10 non-homosexuals could not be found in Sodom. What are the odds that every single inhabitant of Sodom was homosexual? Were there no women and if so, were all of the women lesbians? How did the city propogate itself if all of the inhabitants were homosexual? Even San Fransico with it enormous population of gay people has heterosexual inhabitants. \n \n If the city was destroyed because the crowd outside of Lot's door wanted to have homosexual sex with the angels that then must mean that the crowd was entirely male. This must be true because if women were in the crowd outside of Lot's door clamoring to have sex with the angels it would be heterosexual sex they were seeking not homosexual sex unless the angels were women. However, if the angels were women, that would of course mean that the men outside of Lot's door were not seeking homosexual sex. I guess the argument could be made that one of the angels was male and the other was female, but then that opens up a whole new theological argument regarding gender of angels and it also opens up the possibility that the men would have wanted to have sex with the female angel and the women would have wanted to have sex with the male angel thereby eliminating homosexuality entirely. Therefore, if one is to make the argument that Sodom's doom was homosexuality we must assume that the crowd outside of Lot's door was entirely homosexual males. If this is true, then either there were no heterosexual female or male inhabitants of Sodom or if they did exist, they were not outside Lot's home on that night. If there were heterosexual female and male inhabitants of Sodom, then it is likely that they numbered at least ten. So then why did God destroy Sodom if he had promised to spare the city if at least 10 heterosexuals could be found? \n \n The answer is in Ezekiel 16:49-50 \n Righteous did not mean non-homosexual.\n\n I addressed this in the post above. I agree righteous does not mean non-homosexual, nor is heterosexual relations a ticket to righteousness. I submit there are more heterosexual sinners than homosexual sinners, simply because the fornicating/adulterating population is much larger than the homosexual population. it still does not follow that homosexuals can be credited as righteous\n \n \nUnkerPaulie:\n \n You will notice that I have taken certain liberties with your argument. I hope you will not mind, as it is done solely for the purpose of experimentation. I have exchanged the word homo for hetero, the word same for opposite and the word gay for straight. The idea is to put the shoe on the other foot. I am assuming from your moniker, that you are a man, if not my apologies and the experiment will not work.\n\n I am a man, no worries about being diplomatic with me :)\n \n \nNow for the experiment:\n \n From this point forward imagine resisting your feelings toward women. The next time you meet an incredible woman that you are tremendously attracted to, you must resist the urge. If you are currently in a committed relationship with a woman you are in love with, you must leave her immediately and put your feelings toward her out of your mind. \n No fantasizing about women, and no relationships with women that go beyond platonic -- EVER! You are limited to having good close women friends for the rest of your life. Unfortunately, in keeping with the rules, we must also prohibit any type of self gratification as it would undoubtly occur in conjuction with the aforementioned prohibited act of fantasizing about women. \n \n However, all is not lost, you are permitted to settle down and have a committed relationship with any man of your choosing.\n\n How is that an experiment?\n \n listen, my personal position on homosexuality is not one of condemnation. believe it or not, right now I have a lot doubts about the infallability of the Bible, and the validity of anything in the Bible as a whole. I am even doubting if anything in the Gospels about Jesus is true, particularly concerning the performance of miracles. so my position in this debate hardly has anything to do with my personal belief.\n \n however, I can debate against your attempt to justify a homosexual relation on what the Bible says. I can also debate against the notion that homosexuality stems from a characteristic people are born with.\n \n as far as I have seen, the Bible condemns homosexuality. trying to look for the contrary in the Bible itself may prove futile",

   "Remember, sex outside of the sanction of marriage is against God's approval, whether it is hetero or gay couples. so unless you are married, the question of sex is sin is already a given. \n\n \n What are the biblical passages that codify the procedure for entering into a marital relationship before the eyes of God? What if entering into a marital relationship before God (as opposed to entering into a legal contract of marriage before the government) is accomplished by making a lifetime committment to your partner before God? Where are the passages that specifically prohibit a woman from making a lifetime committment to another woman before God? Please keep in mind there are many activities that the Bible does not specifically mention or condone that society deems acceptable. Ex: medical procedures to prolong life, marriage between persons who because of health problems, age or distance cannot consumate the marriage ( thereby eliminating the act of cleaving as the official procedure for entering into a marital relationship), eating foods that are genetically altered, marriage between heterosexuals who cannot bear children, pig farming, watching television, organ donation, playing professional sports, artificial insemination, ballroom dancing, rock and roll music, robotics, space exploration, marrying a person of another race or culture. This list is by no means exhaustive. None of these things are specifically condoned by the Bible. Do you therefore consider them prohibited? \n \n \n \nI really cant help you concerning Greek, Hebrew or Aramic versions of the scriptures, I dont have access to them, and even if I did I dont know the languages. but here are some scriptures to work with:\n \n Gen 2:24, 25 - Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.

If you are truly trying to justify a homosexual relationsip, why go to the Bible for confirmation? \n\n \n Accurate exegesis combined with the proper historical context negates your assertion that Romans contains a prohibition on women loving women. I refer you to this morning's post of John Keatings sermon on the Romans passage.\n \n \n \nI addressed this in the post above. I agree righteous does not mean non-homosexual, nor is heterosexual relations a ticket to righteousness. I submit there are more heterosexual sinners than homosexual sinners, simply because the fornicating/adulterating population is much larger than the homosexual population. it still does not follow that homosexuals can be credited as righteous. \n\n \n Sexual orientation in and of itself, either hetero or homo, does not make one righteous or unrighteous. It is my argument that in the context of the destruction of the City of Sodom, the lack of righteousness that angered God was related to idolatry, greed, sloth, selfishness, self centeredness and a total lack of concern for those in need. See Ezekiel 16:49-50 Ezekiel 6. In other words, Sodomites were hedonists who worshiped false gods. Therefore, a righteous person as contemplated by Genesis would likely have been one who was hardworking, generous, welcoming and compassionate, and who worshiped only Jehova. If even 10 hardworking, generous, welcoming, compassionate persons who worshiped only Jehova could have been found then Sodom would have been spared. It is illogical to say that Sodom was destroyed because of homosexuality, yet people assert that argument passionately without addressing the problems with that argument. Even you failed to address the Ezekiel passage. So I must ask why ignore the obvious?\n \n As it seems my original point was lost, please allow me to reiterate my issues with the Sodom bludgeon.\n \n \"It was only in the last few years that I discovered without the help of a concordance, some obscure verses in Ezekiel 16:49-50 that addressed the sins of Sodom.

So then why did God destroy Sodom if he had promised to spare the city if at least 10 heterosexuals could be found? \n \n The answer is in Ezekiel 16:49-50\n \n \n\n How is that an experiment?\n \n\n \n The experiment is for you to apply the principles you are propounding to your own life. You say \"feelings dont control actions, choices do. you always decide whether to act on your feelings or not, so clearly feelings are not a controlling factor. secondly, no scientific experiment has ever conclusively linked a particular behavior to any genetic, physical or biological attribute. behavior and genetics so far have absolutely no links\" \n \n If this statement is true, then it would apply to heterosexual feelings as well as homosexual feelings. Therefore, you can choose whether or not to act on your heterosexual feelings. You seem to have an expectation that I as a homosexual am obliged to ignore my feelings towards the woman I love in order to meet societal norms. Given your implicit assertion that an unattached person choosing to ignore his or her feelings of attraction towards another unattached person is a good idea, I think it would be appropriate for you to do so yourself.\n Certainly, you also can ignore your feelings towards women. I am asking you to act on your argument and teach by example. Why limit the exercise of self discipline and restraint to homosexuals? If heterosexuals were to resist their feelings towards each other then the world will be that much tidier. We could propagate the species through artificial insemination and children could be raised by government employees. That way people would not waste time and energy acting on their feelings toward their children. Imagine the increase in productivity.\n \n I think the idea would be to avoid acting on feelings that that would result in behavior abusive and hurtful to others. Behavior related to certain feelings like greed, anger, bitterness, jealousy, fear, and hatred should clearly be avoided. In some situations, it does not take a rocket scientist to know not to act on a feeling. For example when the driver in the car next to you flips you off, and anger motivates the urge to run him off the road, you should choose not to act. Other circumstance require a more nuanced approach. This is where the ability to to analyse a given situation and make a good decision comes in handy. Before I act on a feeling that is not obviously bad like anger, I should ask myself, what is my motivation? Would restraint would be appropriate? Even if my motivation is pure, I should ask myself what is the potential repercussion of acting on this feeling? Could someone be hurt? If so what is my responsibility? If it is a business competitor, taking their business could hurt them. Do I owe them a duty? It may depend on the individual facts. If my parents are hurt that I am not going into the family business am I obligated to humor them to avoid causing them pain? In most situations humility, respect for others and thoughtfulness provide excellent guidelines for appropriate behavior.\n \n \n\n however, I can debate against your attempt to justify a homosexual relation on what the Bible says.\n\n \n I am not using the bible to justify homosexuality. I am specifically refuting the arguments of those who misuse the Bible to bludgeon and oppress homosexuals. \n \n \nI can also debate against the notion that homosexuality stems from a characteristic people are born with.\n\n \n Yes you can and I can debate against the notion that heterosexuality stems from a characteristic people are born with. To what end?\n \n \n\n as far as I have seen, the Bible condemns homosexuality. trying to look for the contrary in the Bible itself may prove futile \n\n \n See the posts I have provided taken from the sermon notes of Pastor John Keating.",

To what end?\n\n to what end? lol, my lady, this point is the crux of my debate and the foundation of gay justification. just as you can point out that heterosexual behavior, or any sexual orientation for that matter, does not stem from a characteristic people are born with, then it is true that heterosexual preference, or homosexual preference, or any sexual preference is acquired. nobody is born gay, you become gay as you form your identity.\n \n with that established, homosexual orientation is a choice, we can move on from there\n \n too long have homosexuals been hiding behind the \"scientific mask\" that gayness is genetic/physiological/biological (i.e., a characteristic you are borm with). however, this is not true. as long as gays can start taking responsibility for their own actions and stop blaming genetics (and, by extension, blaming God), we can move on to more substantial truths",

   "\n \n listen, my personal position on homosexuality is not one of condemnation. believe it or not, right now I have a lot doubts about the infallability of the Bible, and the validity of anything in the Bible as a whole. I am even doubting if anything in the Gospels about Jesus is true, particularly concerning the performance of miracles. so my position in this debate hardly has anything to do with my personal belief. \n\n \n \n Unkerpaulie:\n \n Therein lies your problem. You cannot wield an instrument (the Word of God)with accuracy and confidence if you don't know how it functions and doubt its true purpose. The Word of God is useless in the hands of someone whose cardia is closed. Even an abundance of academic knowledge is nothing more than gnosis until the believer accepts the gnosis as truth and it is transferred to the cardia where it becomes epignosis. Epignosis is the only form in which the believer can use the Word of God. It process akin to metabolism. Consider food on a menu. What good is food on a menu to a man suffering from malnutrition? Unless the food is ordered and eaten it cannot be metabolized and it will not supply the energy and nutrients necessary for the body's vital functions. The Word of God is no different. Academic knowledge of Bible doctrine alone is nothing more than food on a menu. An argument based on unmetabolized Bible verses produces human viewpoint. \n \n Unfortunately this is not something an unbeliever will relate to. I would have more luck trying to describe the color brown to someone who has been blind since birth. It takes humility, spiritual hunger, knowledge of the Word and the Holy Spirit to make the process of spiritual metabolism work. \n \n Finally, you have made it abundantly clear that you do not have a horse in this race and are arguing for argument's sake. That of course is your perogative. \n \n My goal is not to argue with you until one of us tires and the other can claim victory. If that is what you desire, then please go ahead, grab your flag and take your victory lap around the arena. If my posts give even one person pause for thought, then I will have what I hoped for.",

I've been a believer all my life. as far as what the Bible says, Im very familiar with the scriptures.\n \n consider your own viewpoint. you are hunting the scriptures for passages justifying your homosexual relationship. you find none, but claim that you have cited no passages condemning it, therefore you feel justified (even though, in actuality, the Bible repeatedly condemns homosexuality). is your position of manipulating the scriptures to justify your personal agena any better than my indecisiveness? is it worse to twist the meaning of the scripture so that you can live by it, or simply not live by it at all?\n \n and you never participated in my experiment...",

   "\"a. A common misconception is that gays and lesbians molest children at a far higher rate than heterosexuals. This myth has long been used to prevent gay men and lesbians from working with children. In truth, most children who are molested are molested by heterosexual men. \n \n b. Why do so many people consider AIDS/HIV to be a gay disease when: The World Health Organization reports that heterosexual contact is responsible for over 70% of all AIDS/HIV cases world wide?\"\n \n \n \n Your point makes no sense. Yes, more children are molested by heterosexual men, BUT ONLY BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE HETEROSEXUAL MEN. And yes, Heterosexuals make up 70% of AIDS cases, but for the same reason. You are assuming that half of the world is homosexual, if that were the case then you would make sense. Look at your b., 30% of AIDS cases are spread through homosexuals, but less then 1% of people are homosexuals. So actually, you are much much more likely to spread AIDS as a homosexual.\n \n As to your verses, the guy you are quoting is obviously some kind of crock or cult starter. He deprives his ideas from the world, not from the Bible. We are warned of such people in the bible.\n \n You addressed no New Testement verses and your only defense for Old Testement ones were to confuse people with Hebrew words at to try and point out other things in the bible you didn't agree with.\n \n You talked about tatoos being wrong, actually the verse was refering to marking yourself because that is what the pagans did.\n \n You mentioned a verse where men couldn't trim there beard, that was directed at priests and teachers for different reasons.",
