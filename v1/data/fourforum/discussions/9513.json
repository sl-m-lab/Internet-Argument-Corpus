   "There may have been similar threads to this posted; I can't be bothered to trawl through all the pages of threads.\n \n My reasons for creating this thread were motivated by a comment on 4forums that \"creationism is false independent of evolution\".\n \n I believe this to be true. Can anyone provide any solid evidence, independent of trying to disprove the Modern Synthesis, that the Genesis account of the creation of the earth and life has any merit?\n \n I seriously doubt it. \n \n Even if the Evolutionary Liberal Atheist Conspiracy is a reality, creationists (or rather Biblicists) have yet to take one solitary step towards providing even tenuous evidence for the Genesis account.\n \n My central assertion is: If the Modern Synthesis were disproven, we would be stuck in a situation where we wouldn't have the slightest clue as to the origin of the earth or life.\n \n ON EDIT: OK, evolution has nothing to do with the origin of the earth, but the Genesis account conflicts with the basics of modern cosmology, so if modern cosmology and the modern synthesis were both disproven, we would be utterly stuck in ignorance.\n \n In this hypothetical scenario, whence comes the Genesis evidence?",
