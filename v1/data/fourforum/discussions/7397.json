It's easy and convenient to make a blanket, unqualified statement like \"our policy shouldn't be to torture any prisoner\" when torture is an undefined concept. One could argue that discomfort or mental fatigue isn't really torture. On the other hand, someone could argue that even being in prison period IS a form of torture, and so we torture people by the very act of incarceration by our criminal justice system.

If a behavior is wrong, then it is always wrong and it should never be indulged in. If torture is wrong, and the fact that you won't use it on honorable soldiers suggests you believe that it is, than to use it is immoral. The fact that the enemy is evil does not relieve us of our moral obligations. If you cast aside your morals because the enemy is evil, than how are you any different from them? After all, they're using dishonorable methods because they feel our evil warrants such measures. They say that any actions are justified in fighting the \"Great Satan.\" How is that any different from your position?",

Terrorists are not, and should be disposed of like the mad dogs they are.\n \n\n But this is a very subjective interpretation. In a war, especially the one we are engaged in, who can claim to be an authority on what is 'honourable' or not? According to US supporters, the terrorists are simply 'evil' and, in your own words, 'mad dogs'. From the point of view of those who suffer as a result of US military action, it is the US who is 'evil'. \n \n The only obvious difference between the tactics employed by the US and those employed by the terrorists or the resistance in Iraq is that the US has vastly more money and material. The phenomenon of suicide bombing has grown out of the lack of other available effective means of attack, as well as the extremist martyrdom aspect of Islamic culture.\n \n Those who label the terrorists 'cowardly' because they do not use 'conventional' forms of warfare are ignoring the fact that there is no 'conventional' warfare; war has changed as technology developed and the US's strategies have changed as they have grown more and more absurdly supreme in the military sphere. It is hard to see how the large scale bombing of countries like Vietnam, Afghanistan and now Iraq can be justified as more 'honourable' than suicide attacks, and the only justification given is that this is 'conventional' warfare.\n \n Therefore I disagree completely with your statement that \"terrorists are not [entitled to humane treatment]\" which you justify, in your first paragraph, on the grounds that they are somehow less than human. We cannot, in war, judge people by the methods they use, when those methods are simply the result of capitalising on the most effective tactics. No nation (or movement) in the world has a hope in hell of resisting the US using 'conventional' means, so we can only expect them to choose guerilla-style tactics over large-scale engagements every time. This does not make them 'evil'.\n \n In conclusion, I fully agree with Kronus and will summarise my thinking on this in two points:\n \n 1) Our behaviour, even (or especially) in wartime should be consistent with the morals we believe our society stands for.\n \n 2) If we do believe our enemy to be truly 'evil', then surely we must maintain the moral high ground and retain what we see as 'goodness', otherwise we have achieved nothing.",

While the US has never, with one justifiable exception, used direct military action on a ME/Islamic/Arab nation, Western nations as a whole have taken many strategic actions which can be seen as provocation, such as the essential bribery of ME governments such as Saudi Arabia and Iran before the revolution, and in fact Iraq before Gulf War I, these governments have a history of horrible repression and yet we support/ed them with weapons and money because they gave us good deals on oil.\n The fact that the US was selling arms to both sides during the Iran-Iraq war, and the destruction of Afghanistan purely to effect some Cold War power-play are other motivations for wishing to strike at the US, as are the presence of US troops in Saudi Arabia, the partisan support for Israel no matter how many international laws they break, and even the long-term legacy of pre-WWII colonialism and imperialism.\n Seriously, if you look at the history of warfare it has always been the rich and powerful who have either started wars, or set up the conditions that lead to rebellion: the modern phenomenon of global terrorism is basically a global rebellion against US hegemony taken to extremes by an ever-growing minority, like it or not.\n \n And did Iraq start this particular phase of the war? I don't think so. I think it was some guy called Osama, but maybe you know more than I.",

There are indeed ideals worth dying for, but an abstract notion of non-violence is not one of them.\n \n Our newspaper recently ran an article about a citizen who was born during WWII, and never saw the father who died in Europe when he was only a few months old.

   "I would say that we ARE at war against terrorism in those places, it's just being fought in different ways. There are other ways to fight terrorism than a head-on military conflict--clandestine operations, diplomacy, etc. The way to approach each situation in each place calls has to be handled on that sitaution's own merits.\n\n for your sake and the sake of the country, i do hope that i am wrong and you are right about this. so far, all indications are that we are buddying up with saudi arabia, egypt and jordan, and ONLY afghanistan and iraq have seen the invasive intervention as an effort to round up terrorists. the other countries that have been mentioned as future targets are sudan, lebanon and iran, from what i know. these cuontries all have stronger ties to al qaeda than iraq, but not nearly as much as the other arabian countries.\n \n the most disturbing fact about these presumed \"clandestine operations\" is that the majority of americans are not demanding action against these countries. i mean the facts are there. the bin ladens are saudi nationals and close friends to the bush administatrion. 14 of the 19 9/11 hijackers were saudi nationals, and most of osama's terrorist funding came from his saudi-based businesses and assets. the public has been presented with this info, in the commission report, on the web, and in lesser instances in the media.\n \n i would love to see a greater pressure put on the administration to account for anti-terrorist action against saudi arabia, egypt and jordan especially. these are by far the largest supporters of islamic terrorism in the world. why isnt this happening? thats why i continue to maintain that this war on terror is nothing but a deceptive sham\n \n \nI would agree as long as there is one condition--that these sort of tactics ONLY be used against the terrorists and not uninvolved civilians.\n\n definitely. \n \n bear in mind though, that very often \"civillians\" are sleeper terrorists, and are very hard to distinguish, if not impossible, from innocent civillians. the hotel bombing 2 months ago is a perfect example. a \"civillian\" couple walked into the hotel lobby with bombs strapped to their bodies. a terrorist without a exploding belt is basically a civillian, but hes really a terrorist\n \n the only way we can determine who the terrorists are among the civillians is through serious intelligence, including unauthorized and invasive spying on personal communications and activities in those countries. we're doing hat here in america now. if this is about terror, then employ these tactics where the terroists actaully are",

   "Do I think you should have been tortured?! Absolutely not brother! You're an american citizen who has the right to speak out and say just about anything you want. Torturing one of our own for some petty libel or slander charge is disgusting. In fact torturing one of our own for any reason is totally unacceptable. In my mind theres a difference between us and them. That line is citizenship. If however, a person is on the other side of that line and they're a TERRORIST then they should stand by for some very long and painful nights. Key words and main operators there being terrorist AND non citizen. Some one will probably throw the old illegal immigrant thing into the mix. Fine by me. You all just saw me qualify my statement by saying that the main operator, the key point for determining whether or not a person should be tortured is whether they are a TERRORIST . So, for example, a terrorist who was a citizen of the US should not be tortured under any circumstances. Likewise, any noncitizen of the US who WAS NOT a terrorist should not be tortured under any circumstances. I realize this one is a bit of a stretch logically speaking, but just so we're clear non us citizens who are not terrorists should not be tortured either.\n \n By the way what was it you said?",

   "Whilst I agree that a gov't should have it's own citizens foremost in it's mind and exist to serve them, torturing non-citizens on the mere say so of other non citizens OR even the mere say so of citizens shouldn't be done.\n \n And that seems to be what you were suggesting.\n \n Most detainees are there on very dubious grounds, many being handed over to the US by Pakistan or the former Northern Alliance or by people who were paid bounties for the capture of 'terrorists'.\n \n Thanks though for clarifying that one should be 1st made known to be a terrorist.\n I do have lesser qualms over torturing the likes of an Osama but only if it would yeild actionable information which usually isn't the case. History is full of martyrs who've died painfully for their faiths, many of them Christians. So, torturing an actual believing fanatic would probably not work. Many would toss out anything to get the pain to stop too as you even noted.\n So, we're mostly left with lack of care for another human and revenge against them for causing us harm.\n I don't think a lack of care is good for American PR or garnering us sympathy (even if it's not useful for much) and there are more and better ways to get revenge or justice than the use of torture.\n \n Heck, a life of solitary confinement for Osama would work fine. \n Just feed him ficticious newspapers where it stated Muslims were being defeated in wars, converting to Christianity, Israel secured permant control of all Israel including the holy sites, the secular president of Saudi Arabia was dismantling Mecca to make it into a resort for visiting tourists. Some brief radio clips to back it up...\n And nice editorials here and there blaming it all on him for following a path of terror as opposed to passive resistance that has worked well in the past.\n \n \n As to me...\n \n As I said, I said NOTHING.",

Those who say it is NEVER permissble have the burden of proof. Imagine the old scenario: You know that a certain terrorist has information which, if known by the interrogator, would prevent 9/11. You have reason to believe that a technique such as waterfboarding or cutting off would have a reasonable chance of yield the information you need. You do the moral calculation.

I agree with you on all counts. Especially since one of the 19 9/11 terrorists was picked up prior to the attack, his computer revealed active participation in an upcoming attack in America, and they had a high degree of chatter so they knew something big was coming. But the highest levels of the powers that be wouldn't even allow them to detain him. We had so much to go on regarding the threat of 9/11 that it can be safely said that our Government aided and abetted the terrorists. Not purposely of course, but due to our ignorance and lack of commitment.\n \n Now, regarding turning the other cheek; again you couldn't be more right. That passage was spoken to individuals in how they should respond to another individual. To apply it to Governments which are entrusted with the welfare of its citizens is totally out of context and a corruption of its meaning. War is terrible but sometimes necessary if evil is to be opposed. Otherwise Dictators, Tyrants and Despots would have taken over the world long ago. Again, welcome to 4forums. emoticon_xhoho",

The Renaissance didn't just spring out of nowhere. \n\n \n ROTFLMAO. WRONG. DEAD WRONG. The renaissance was the result of a loss of control of the church. After the plague wiped out much of Europe the church lost a great deal of control both because people started asking \"what kind of god would do this\" and because the church took ENORMOUS losses during the plague and they simply did not have enough clergy left to exhibit the amount of control they once enjoyed. \n \n Why dont you give me an example of the church preserving the learning of antiquity against barbarism. The church viewed virtually everything that was not biblical in nature as heretical and burned it, and anybody who believed it. \n \n The same massive die off that tore control from the church also allowed for a massive redistribution of wealth which allowed for idle time and the support of scientist and intellectuals, which eventually led to the age of reason, where we rediscovered a bunch of knowledge that the church had destroyed because it was considered heretical. \n \n \nWitch trials: When was the last one? And do you seriously attribute this to Christianity, as such, rather than a corruption of it (or a form of paganism)?\n\n \n Yes. Absolutely. The CATHOLIC CHURCH was trying and executing people for witchcraft. This was not a form of paganism. \n \n \n \nCorruption in South America: You're kidding. What social justice there is in Central and South America is the product of the Catholic Church agitating on behalf of the poor. Ever hear of liberation theology? Priests and nuns have been killed for trying to bring Christian social justice to these peoples. I'd count this as a plus for Christianity (even though I don't believe in \"liberation theology, which tends too strongly, for my taste, toward socialism).\n\n \n Wrong. Absolutely wrong, 100% wrong. It is not just the involvement of the church that leads to the problems in S America, it is the TEACHINGS of the church and of Christianity as a whole. Render unto Caesar what is Caesars, easier for a rich man to pass through the eye of a needle than to enter the kingdom of god. I can tell you 100% that if I was the ruler of a country, Christianity WOULD BE the official religion. The entire religion from the first to the last can pretty much be boiled down to \"grease up, bend over and take it. You will be rewarded after you are dead\". THAT is what allowed Christianity to spread as it did. It is a religion that virtually every government or leader on the planet can get behind. It allows you to put you foot on the peoples throat and tells them not to resist, they will be rewarded later...when they are dead. \n \n Christian charity is almost an oxymoron. We feed people and help take care of them while simultaneously instilling beliefs that ensure their continued poverty and oppression. It is sick and wrong. \n \n \nAnd because you're too young to remember, go back to the civil rights movement here in America. Southern Christian Leadership Conference ring a bell to you? Archbishop Cody took an iron hand in desegregating New Orleans Cathoic schools. Jesuits were then, and still are, at the vanguard of social justice movements --- literally at the front. Catholic Charities and other Christian organizations do more to ameliorate suffering than anyone I know. Christianity is blossoming in Africa and China, despite oppression. \n\n \n We had the civil rights movement because we had slavery, racism, and segregation. Slavery,racism, and segregation in the western world were primarily the result of christian intellectual arguments. The bible condones slavery, and does not mention black people at all (only because people in the middle ages were not bright enough to realize that Jesus was probably black). Do you have an example of a justification for slavery from that time that did not rely on the bible as a justification? Arabs and Jews were not used as slaves in the west because they were mentioned in the bible. \n \n \nAnd no; George's Bush's saying that God told him to invade Iraq did not make this a war in the name of or on behalf of Christians, nor has the advance of Christianity ever been advanced by any responsible critic as a cause of the war. Rome and the U.S. Bishops condemn it, if you haven't checked recently.\n \n\n \n Teh christian guy sent hundreds of thousands of troops to invade and kill the enemy based on what he claims was the word of his god. Sorry, that war was the result of christianity. His faith gave him the justification he needed to slaughter people. \n \n By your definition the only war in the history of the planet earth has been the crusades, and even that one is questionable because while it was the church that led them and called for them, but not all christians were on board.\n \n Sorry, but it is the guy with troops to command that makes the decision, and according to Bush he made the decision he did based on his religion. Not only that, but if you look at who supported him and still does in that war, nearly 100% of those who still support his decision (roughly 97.4%) identify themselves as either evangelicals or \"extremely religious\". \n \n Say what you will, but at the end of the day, the war in Iraq was a religious war. Look right here on the forum. Go back through the barious posts and look at who supported the war...it is always the jesus freaks because even if we are too politically correct to say so, we dont like the damn dirty muslims. They are too close to black (and remember black people are not quite human since they are not mentioned in the bible) and they practice their heathen religion. We dont like the way they live or the fact that their savior is different than the one that we invented.",

   "Sure! the same Arabs who destroyed all the Christian Churches and the Library of Alexandria in 642.\n\n \n Wrong. The burning of the library was first recorded by Bishop Gregory Bar Hebr\u00e6us 300 years after it was supposedly done. There is no record of the event anywhere else. The good bishop spent most of his life documenting supposed atrocities of the Muslims, the majority of which turned out to be the result of an overactive imagination...namely that of the Bishop. In his defense, that was during the dark ages when virtually any knowledge that was generated outside of the church was heretical, so he probably did not know how silly his claims would look later, and to an educated audience we were NOT at risk of being burned as a heretic for studying documents that originated in the Arab world. \n \n The account is widely viewed by scholars as little more than a fairy tale, especially given the fact that we know today that Caliph Omar, who allegedly ordered it done, had his own library with over 20,000 works in it and employed a number of scribes whose sole responsibility was to expand his library.

   "Daewoo says \"[Christianity] is a religion that virtually every government or leader on the planet can get behind. It allows you to put you foot on the peoples throat and tells them not to resist, they will be rewarded later...when they are dead.\" \n \n You're simply wrong. To give you a blazing example of where you err: The Sandinistas in Nicaragua surely did not advocate allowing the right wing Somoza government to put its foot on the neck of the people and have the people simply await a better life. The Sandinistas --- in case you forgot --- led a bloody revolution against Somoza's putting his boot on the peoples' necks. Several Sandinista leaders were Jesuit priests who proclaimed liberation theology, a subject about which you seem to know nothing. Liberation theology would appeal to you; it's pretty Marxist, and it was \"invented\" largely by Jesuit political intellectuals seeking a better life in this real world for the oppressed. \n \n As for your expected rejoinder that liberation theology is not mainstream Christianity, I would say this: You're correct; mainstream Christianity is nowhere near as Marxist as liberation theologists would like. It is one thing to say that, however, and something else entirely to accuse Christianity of aiming to step on the necks of \"the people.\" The various Christian religions send far more money and aid to victims of poverty and catastrophe than you would like to admit. \n \n Finally, here in America, Christianity has found a way to accommodate both the left and right, and certainly without the aim of either the left or the right to oppress Christians. Just in case you don't live here in the U.S., you would do well to know that anyone claiming to be really oppressed here, and to having their oppression be at the hands of Christianity, draws a snicker. Tell me, daewoo, what government in the world today uses Christianity as a tool of oppression? And give me some evidence.\n \n Finally --- no, not finally, I'll have more to say in a later post --- you say that \"The bible condones slavery, and does not mention black people at all (only because people in the middle ages were not bright enough to realize that Jesus was probably black).\" So not only must Jesus have been lying when he said he was a Jew, but the Jews who knew what they were --- Jews--- must have taken Jesus at His word, despite seeing a black man in front of them. So not only were the medievals stupid, but the Jews of Jesus' time were too. The consequences of your assertions are truly comical and very, very revelatory. \n \n As for your assertion about the Renaissance, you seem to forget that Michelangelo painted the Sistine Chapel and was a favorite of \"The Renaissance Popes.\" Ever been to Rome or Florence? The Renaissance reeks of Catholicism, and vice versa.\n \n As for the charge that Christianity trashed prior learning: Would you like me to name some of the great European universities that grew out of monasteries? That were founded by Christian monks and priests? To cite passages in Augustine and Aquinas that draw directly on Plato and Aristotle? Did you know that the phrase \"big bang\" was first used by Jesuit physicist Georges-Henri Lemaitre? \n \n Does the bible endorse slavery? In a way, but not in the way you say. Certainly, slavery existed among Jews, Romans, and others. But Paul said \"For as many of you as have been baptized in Christ, have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek: there is neither bond nor free: there is neither male nor female. For you are all one in Christ Jesus\" (Galatians 3:27-28; cf. 1 Corinthians 12:13). \n \n Did some Christian religions go so far as to advocate slavery? Yes. In doing so, did they voiolate basic Christian principles? Yes. By the way, I am devoutly Christian, and I have personally debated David Duke about whether the Bible endorses racism or slavery. I can count on my hands the number of \"Christians\" I know who see things the way Mr. Duke does. Among Christians, such people are seen not as Christian, but as whackos. And, oh yes: St. Augustine, one of Christinaity's \"founding fathers\", was black. We'd also love to claim Othello. Why do I have to go on? To persuade you that Christianity is filled with saints? What an absurdity that would be. Christians are comprised of the same aggregation of fallible earthly ingredients pulling us toward vice and selfish ugliness as you are, and they're taught to be aware of and unaccepting toward their imperfection. It's silly to judge a religion by the number of times its adherents violate its teachings. To the contrary, the beauty of a religion --- and here I do include the beauty of Christianity --- can be seen more clearly when its teachings are seen as being in contrast with human imperfection. Far preferable that religion exhort its adherents to transcend themselves than to bend to our lower urges. \n \n Yours truly\n \n saints (a reference to my favorite football team, not my spiritual calibre).\n \n AMDG",

Case closed.\n \n Maybe it depends on what torture IS. No it doesn't. This is clearly outlined as well. This concept that torture is okay was brought about by the DICK and endorsed by GEORGE, neither of whom served in the armed forces. These two do not make it more American to torture, period. On the other hand, ask McCain who spent 5 years in a prison camp, who fought and was captured for the principles we live by; one principle being NOT TO TORTURE.",
