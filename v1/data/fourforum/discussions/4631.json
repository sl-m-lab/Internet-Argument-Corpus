   "NY Court Rejects Workers' Comp Claim By Same-sex Partner\n by Beth Shapiro 365Gay.com New York Bureau \n Posted: March 23, 2005 11:02 am ET \n (New York City) A New York man whose same-sex partner was killed in a jet crash has been denied workers' compensation benefits because the couple was not legally married.\n \n The Appellate Division of state Supreme Court Tuesday upheld a decision by the state Workers Compensation Board.\n \n \"Domestic partners do not fall within the definition of surviving spouse under workers' compensation law,\" Justice Anthony T. Kane stated in his decision.\n \n Joe Lopes, was killed on November 12, 2001, while working as a flight attendant on American Airlines flight 587 when it crashed shortly after takeoff from John F. Kennedy Airport. \n \n His surviving spouse, Bill Valentine, was turned down when he applied for workers' compensation benefits given to people whose spouses die on the job. \n \n Despite a history of recognizing unmarried couples as spouses, the New York State Workers' Compensation Board denied benefits to Valentine in July 2003 because he and Lopes did not possess a marriage certificate. \n \n Lopes and Valentine had been in a relationship for more than 21 years. The couple was financially interdependent, constructed powers of attorney agreements and was among the first couples in New York City to register as domestic partners in 1994.\n \n Lambda Legal, which represented Valentine argued that since same-sex couples are not legally permitted to marry in New York State the court should accept the domestic partner registry as equivalent to marriage.\n \n Lambda also argued that the state's decision to make workers' compensation death benefits available to the same-sex survivors of those killed in the September 11 terrorist attacks set a precedent. But the appellate court held that that special law strictly limited the definition to domestic partners of employees killed as a result of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Because Lopes died as a result of a plane crash in November 2001, the special clause does not apply to him, the court said.\n \n \"Special legislation in response to those unprecedented terrorist attacks could rationally provide more or different compensation to families and dependents of those victims,\" Judge Kane wrote.\n \n The American Airlines plane crash in which Lopes lost his life also killed 259 others.\n \n http://www.365gay.com/newscon05/03/032305nyBens.htm\n _________________________________________________\n \n And the critics say they we can get all the same rights as marriage at a good lawyer's office.",

But one person should not get to choose between sugar and artificial sweetener when I am allowed only sweetner. If marriage is a legal right, it must be allowed to all couples. If you do not agree with this, then it must be removed as a legal right and replaced entirely with civil unions. Sugar and sweetner will never be the same thing, and it is an evil action to take all the sugar for oneself then to refuse it to others, telling them that they can make due with the artificial stuff.\n \n It's not the composition of the sugar I want redefined; it is who is allowed to use it. Changing the composition of sugar would affect other people who want to use it, and it would require people to put forth additional effort for my sake alone. Allowing a same-sex couple to get married does nothing but allow everyone access to that which already exists. I do not want to make special laws just for myself; I believe that the opponents of same-sex marriage are the ones who seek to do that. I want to give everyone equal access to the existing rights today, equal access to the sugar. There is enough to go around.",

Furthermore, you still have not answered to the claim the these benefits and protection can be obtained in someway other than treading on marriage as you have claimed.

The fact is that nothing short of marriage gives you the protections, benefits or the honor as a citizen as marriage does. Ther is no \"substitute\".

The fact that he and his quasi-ex-lesbian wife actually got married was hailed as a victory by Exodus and proof-positive that reparative therapy \"worked.\" Of course, his embarrassing slip-up at the gay bar in D.C. put the lie to that one, and the public is all too familiar with married closet-cases like Michael Huffington and that other married politician that came out recently (I've forgotten his name already), but when you're as insecure about your masculinity as these anti's seem to be you apparently cling to any port in a storm, and in this case that wave-battered port still boasts the sign \"Being married means you're not gay,\" and still affords them a method of proclaiming their straightness most people will accept (even, presumably, if they were to find out how much time they spent per day on Gay Rights computer fora).\n \n Obviously, if marriage includes gay people, that will no longer be the case.

I would even argue that most gay rights activists think it is a more optimal solution to keep the term \"marriage\" out of government entirely and give everyone the same benefits.\n \n \nYou see, again, it's not the govt.'s sanction than makes it special.

But marriage is a straight thing.\n\n \n I believe that marriage is about commitment and that the government should therefore grant the benefits of marriage to every committed couple. I am claiming that committed couples deserve marriage. You have stated that commitment is what elevates a marriage, but you nullify that statement by saying that it only applies to straights, that it is a straight thing, and straights deserve a special legal title for it. You cannot claim that it is a commitment thing when you deny committed couples the right to marry; you are saying it is actually not about commitment but about straight commitment. I am saying it is about all commitments of love, and because of that, all commitments of love deserve exactly the same benefits under the law.\n \n \nHaving \"special rights\" certainly does not make me feel special.

My statement referred to the fact that exclusive government benefits can make someone feel speical. But if we agree upon this, that real marriage is not made special because of government benefits, then it does not make sense to claim that real marriage is dilluted if the government benefit of marriage is extended to same-sex couples, and it makes no sense to claim that marriage is dilluted if the government changes the name of its benefits to something else. As you said, it is not government benefits that make a marriage, and because of this, it cannot make sense to say that marriage is less if the government benefits are changed in any way.",

   "My motives are pretty simple: I believe in the sanctity of marriage and want to do my part to protect it, and I want to learn more about this issue. But why would any of you be so concerned about someone else's \"motives\" anyway? Just deal with the arguments presented to you, or present your own. Again, MY concern is about anyone who would concern themselves so with the motives of others (especially when those others have made it clear they mean no hard or ill-will here) that they would look up a posting history and report the \"average number of posts\" in the forum for someone.\n \n It's no less \"strange\" or \"odd\" for someone to spend lots of time posting in a pro-gay rights position than to defend marriage. I could just as easily think some of you are obsessed, but I'm not here to judge you or try to assume publically about the motives of others. I'm here to discuss the issues at hand.\n \n Apparently I can't say the same for some of you. The pattern I'm seeing is that when some of you find that not everyone is converted over to your thinking and instead exemplifies a similar level of argumentative immovability that you all exhibit, you start resorting to personal attacks and questioning of motives. Others have pointed it out too that the ones making personal attacks here are the supposedly \"gay-rights\" posters. This is a pattern, not isolated incidents. What gives? Are your arguments just not good enough to stand on their own, without personal insults and attacks? One must assume that is the case. And don't say you're reacting; As JP pointed out when you spend time using the gay rights issue to insult people as some of you are doing, you should expect others to eventually sting back--when you beat a beehive over and over like a child, sooner or later you're going to get stung. How about simply arguing the issues? Or are you done with the issues now, in favor of personal attacks (as it seems)?\n \n And Justine, you're wrong--it only takes about 20 minutes a day of reading and responding to the posts I do here. If it takes you a lot longer, that's your problem. But more importantly, why the heck would you care either way?",

It's inevitable that some feathers will occasionally get ruffled. What I object to is the piling on, though. There's been quite a bit of that at your expense recently.",

   "I don't think that we should be so hostile with one another. Each of us here is a person with good intentions, and we should treat each other that way. There may be temptation to personally insult someone to prove how wrong that person is, but that never really works. Every person in the world is too stubborn to admit that he is wrong; if we can work with someone to help that person understand, then we are more likely to make a difference. If we insult people with different views, then they'll never feel that their views are wrong.\n \n If you feel someone else has insulted you, intentionally or unintentionally, just say \"That was insulting to me, and here is why I think it is insulting.\" If you question someone's motives, just say, \"I think your motive is ______, and here is why. What do you think?\" If you think someone is repeating the same wrong thing over and over, just point that out too. Understand that this debate is insulting by nature, and that's going to breed insults toward you no matter what side of the debate you are on. But you're better off if you just explain why something was insulting to you or if you apologize and explain your intentions. As I said, human beings do not admit they are wrong easily, and returning personal attacks with more personal attacks won't get us anywhere.",

You seem to be here for honest purposes, and while I don't always agree with your posts, at least I feel you post them out of true intentions. \n \n I don't need to convince you of anything, and I don't owe you anything here--but you're wrong, I have learned some things since I've been in here. It's your choice to see that or not, and it's not my problem if you don't. But what bothers me most is that so far you seem to only want that to be a one-way street. If you want people to learn from you, you have to be willing to have an open mind yourself and learn from them as well. Interestingly enough, I don't approach this is a chance to \"teach\" people. Ultimately that is a condescending approach to take when you try to set yourself up as teacher and others who come here the pupils seeking your knowledge. And you keep saying I should back things up with links more, but you don't back things up with links all that often yourself.\n \n And if your respect toward anyone is grounded in whether or not you perceive that they've learned something from YOU, then you're never going to get anywhere here.\n \n \nA year of posting the same debunked rubbish is going to get your arguments attacked. Not growing in your knowlege of the subject you keep debating gets you attacked. Shouldn't take it personal, It is a debate form.\n\n \n The problem is when you and others attack people here instead of arguments. For instance, Justine wasn't attacking any argument when she made the rude statement that my motives for being here was an \"inflated-ego.\" She was attacking me. In one sentence you claim people are attacking arguments, in another instance you look the other way when people on your side attack people. I think you know this, actually--you're just trying to be loyal to those on your side and so you only criticize people arguing against you. Attacking people here by saying hateful things about them is no better than when people say hateful things about gay people, rather than the arguments of the gay rights movement. This forum isn't meant to be a bashing opportunity. I think that is what JP is trying to tell you.",
