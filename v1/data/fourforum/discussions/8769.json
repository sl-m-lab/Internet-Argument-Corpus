   "It has been shown that animals change biologically without the need for RM + NS. You evolutionists obviously do not disagree with this. My contention is if plasticity can change the size, color, shape of animals (ie finches, peppered moths, tadpoles, etc) then this could give the ILLUSION of evolution in the fossil record. Do you evolutionists understand this concept? Do you understand how if a peppered moth has morphological abilities then it might give the ILLUSION that \"selection\" made these creatures \"evolve\"? Same with the beaks of Darwin's/Grant's finches. I wrote a huge post on how animals emerge pre-adapted, and continue to adapt throughout their lifetimes. Do you not see how this could give the ILLUSION of evolution? -- you've already attributed both the peppered moths and finches as examples of evolution -- yet each case is most certainly an example of either plasticity or the \"throwing of switches\" during development.\n \n \n And see here's where the evolutionary magic fairy dust comes in; all you guys have to do is NOT TEST ANYHING!!! Don't test to see if animals emerge with correct traits. Don't test to see how future generations may emerge with new colors, shapes and sizes to match their new environment. That way it's easy to say -- \"Oh well, that's not evolution because furture generations will not change\" or \"Oh animals cannot pass on acquired traits.\" Both of these are intellectually dishonest statements....the first one is simply untested and ignored, the second is a strawman.\n \n Indeed, evolutionary scientists simply do not test future offspring upon environmental changes -- that way they can continue the dishonest myth that their way is the only way..........but it's not the only way.\n \n Yet then many evolutionists will say \"oh well....plasticity has evolved over millions of years\"\n \n Well heck, has Lamarckism evolved too? This logic is humorous because with one stroke of the pen (keyboard) you have unfalsified your theory. In otherwords you have the following explanation of evolution......yet if that doesn't work out for you, you can always wave your hand and attribute it to \"evolution\":\n \n Evolution is a strange mechanism.\n \n When we say \"animals adapt to their environment\" what we really mean is:\n an animal produces offspring or \"replicates\"\n the replicates are close to the original, but not exact copies\n some of these copies survive and replicate again, others die before they can replicate which copies replicate and which die before they can do so is influenced by the environment inexact copies whose differences make them less well adapted to the environment have a higher probability of dying, those better adapted get a higher chance of surviving to replication age.\n Individual animals do not adapt to their environment\n \n http://robert.cailliau.free.fr/ByLet...Evolution.html\n \n By the way -- I still have not gotten a decent explanation of how plasticity happens if there is no intelligence in the genome to decipher external conditions. Morphological change begins with a conscious awareness of external conditions...which translates to a physical change. This falsifies your theory in my eyes. ---- You cannot tell me that a morphological change in response to a predator happens simply because of a \"chemical reaction.\" Every creature has brain -- and they all use it differently.\n ---------------------\n http://www.fiu.edu/~donnelly/termpaperex1.pdf#search='plasticity%20body%20struc ture'\n \n 1) in the presence of a predator, eggs can hatch at later times:\n \n \n ..... Flatworms (Phagocotus gracilis) were used as\n predators or predator chemical cues upon salamander larvae (Ambystoma texanum and Ambystoma barbouri). The presence of the flatworms and their cues induced the eggs to delay their hatching time. This resulted in larger, and more advanced hatchlings. This finding supports the earlier field observations that the flatworm preyed heavily on smaller, less developed hatchlings. This shift in hatch time is adaptive and supports greater hatchling survival (Sih and Moore 1993).\n \n Any evolutionists care to explain this phenomenon? How can this near-miracle happen without intelligence? \n \n 2) specific morphological changes happens due to predators: \n \n In 1997 McCollum and Leimberger examined the morphological changes that\n arose in the gray treefrog (Hyla chrysoscelis) in response to the presence of a predatory dragonfly (Aesha umbrosa). The larvae that were reared in the presence of the predator differed in shape and in color than those that were reared in predator free environments. The treatments exposed tadpoles to tail damage and to chemical cues of the dragonfly feeding on conspecifics. The tadpoles responded plastically by altering their color and tail shape. The tail was extended, presumably increasing swimming speed and hence survivorship. The color change was seen in the tail. The appearance of color on the tail is thought to attract predatory attacks on the tail rather than on the body.\n \n 3) specific behavior changes as a result of predators\n \n Larval anurans have demonstrated phenotypic plasticity in response to variation in food availability (Anholt 1998). It has been argued that food availability and predation risk are intertwined. This can be demonstrated when food resources in an environment are high, search time by prey is reduced and predation success may suffer. During times of limited\n food availability search time may be lengthened, thus increasing prey vulnerability to predation (Anholt and Werner 1998). In the presence of predators, search time is reduced as activity is restricted to avoid predation. \n \n 4) Diet induces developmental changes in physical characteristics.\n \n Depending on their diet, individuals (tadpoles) of both species develop into either a small-headed omnivore morph, which feeds mostly on detritus, or a large-headed carnivore morph, which specializes on shrimp. \n \n http://www.citeulike.org/user/balicea/article/454684\n --------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Thus if plasticity can instantly effect the hatch time of eggs, the size, shape, color, and physical/behavior characteristics of an animal, then about the only place I see a role for random mutations via natural selection is in the wishfully creative minds of evolutionists.\n \n And this study is just on tadpoles. Does anyone think that this is not a world-wide, creation-wide phenomenon? Of course it is. Every creature is a product of their environment. Traits are formed from the beginning of conception -- all the way throughout life. Over time, this may give the illusion of \"evolution\" in the fossil record. \n \n This would explain why there are virtually no intermediate fossils. This would also explain why gradualism is not found in the fossil record. This would also explain why evolutionists cannot give us any example of random mutations that could lead to cumulative selection -- because they don't exist. S",

   " I wrote a huge post on how animals emerge pre-adapted, and continue to adapt throughout their lifetimes. Do you not see how this could give the ILLUSION of evolution?\n\n \n Not by any means. Evolution works on genetic change that future generations will inherit. Adaptation does no such thing. It changes an individual, but not its genes.\n \n For example, if my parents volunteered to be part of a scientific experiment where they two additional arms fused onto their body before I was ever conceived, I would not be born with two extra arms.\n \n On the other hand, if a genetic mutation made it advantageous to have two additional arms, and both my parents had that mutation, I would be born with both arms.\n \n \n And see here's where the evolutionary magic fairy dust comes in; all you guys have to do is NOT TEST ANYHING!!! Don't test to see if animals emerge with correct traits. Don't test to see how future generations may emerge with new colors, shapes and sizes to match their new environment. That way it's easy to say -- \"Oh well, that's not evolution because furture generations will not change\" or \"Oh animals cannot pass on acquired traits.\" Both of these are intellectually dishonest statements....the first one is simply untested and ignored, the second is a strawman.\n\n \n So the first one is untested, you say? Okay, it's your loss for suggesting people can inherit non-genetic change like the fusing of extra arms on their parents' body.\n \n The only traits animals can pass are genetically-acquired. That is a fact. It's tested by mere observation of the world around us. You could test it too, for all I care. Buy an aquarium and put a pet lizard in it. Chop off the lizard's right arm. Then give him a wife and chop off her right arm, too. Once they've had eggs and the eggs hatch, count the number of arms the baby lizards all have. Logic and observed scientific fact tells us that they will have four limbs-right arm included.\n \n \n Flatworms (Phagocotus gracilis) were used as\n predators or predator chemical cues upon salamander larvae (Ambystoma texanum and Ambystoma barbouri). The presence of the flatworms and their cues induced the eggs to delay their hatching time. This resulted in larger, and more advanced hatchlings. This finding supports the earlier field observations that the flatworm preyed heavily on smaller, less developed hatchlings. This shift in hatch time is adaptive and supports greater hatchling survival (Sih and Moore 1993).\n\n \n Excellent quote mine. The salamanders were larger because-gasp!-they stayed in the egg longer! Did the larger salamander offspring inherit the size change? NO.\n \n \n \n Any evolutionists care to explain this phenomenon? How can this near-miracle happen without intelligence?\n\n \n Rofl... What were they supposed to do if they stayed in the egg longer with more time to feed off of it? Shrink?\n \n \n In 1997 McCollum and Leimberger examined the morphological changes that\n arose in the gray treefrog (Hyla chrysoscelis) in response to the presence of a predatory dragonfly (Aesha umbrosa). The larvae that were reared in the presence of the predator differed in shape and in color than those that were reared in predator free environments.

The tail was extended, presumably increasing swimming speed and hence survivorship. The color change was seen in the tail. The appearance of color on the tail is thought to attract predatory attacks on the tail rather than on the body.\n\n \n Did the tadpoles pass on their altered color and tail shape? NO. Evolution worked to make it so that the tadpoles could adapt their tail color and shape whenever the need arose. Without the genes to adapt like that, they wouldn't be able to adapt.\n \n \n Larval anurans have demonstrated phenotypic plasticity in response to variation in food availability (Anholt 1998). It has been argued that food availability and predation risk are intertwined. This can be demonstrated when food resources in an environment are high, search time by prey is reduced and predation success may suffer. During times of limited food availability search time may be lengthened, thus increasing prey vulnerability to predation (Anholt and Werner 1998). In the presence of predators, search time is reduced as activity is restricted to avoid predation.\n\n \n ... That's pure animal behavior. That's no more logical than saying since I saw a car on the street and moved out of the way that evolution is wrong.\n \n \n Depending on their diet, individuals (tadpoles) of both species develop into either a small-headed omnivore morph, which feeds mostly on detritus, or a large-headed carnivore morph, which specializes on shrimp.\n\n \n No inherited change, as usual. The ability to change is the only thing inherited here, as usual.\n \n \n Thus if plasticity can instantly effect the hatch time of eggs, the size, shape, color, and physical/behavior characteristics of an animal, then about the only place I see a role for random mutations via natural selection is in the wishfully creative minds of evolutionists.\n\n \n Evolution explains the examples' abilities to adapt. Without it, you're in the hole.\n \n \n And this study is just on tadpoles. Does anyone think that this is not a world-wide, creation-wide phenomenon? Of course it is. Every creature is a product of their environment. Traits are formed from the beginning of conception -- all the way throughout life. Over time, this may give the illusion of \"evolution\" in the fossil record.\n\n \n Fossils show inherited change. Adaptation does not.\n \n \n This would explain why there are virtually no intermediate fossils.\n\n \n In that case, your idea is already falsified, because there are too many intermediate fossils to count.\n \n \nThis would also explain why gradualism is not found in the fossil record.\n\n \n Uh, how?\n \n \n This would also explain why evolutionists cannot give us any example of random mutations that could lead to cumulative selection -- because they don't exist.\n\n \n Besides the hundreds of cases in which such things are directly observed, I guess you're right.",

It has been asserted without evidence.\n \nDo you understand how if a peppered moth has morphological abilities then it might give the ILLUSION that \"selection\" made these creatures \"evolve\"?\nSadly for you, the example of the peppered moth, Biston betularia, is an example of a single point mutation on a single gene that has caused the change. In other words, f. carbonaria is the result of a dominant allele, while f. typica is the corresponding recessive. Additionally, there are three other point mutations to the same gene that are known that produce an intermediate form (f. insularia or f. medionigra). These alleles show incomplete dominance.\n \n Similar mutations to the same gene in other species of moth have been observed to cause similar changes in those species. The gene has, or course, been identified and sequenced, and breeding research has shown that it always holds true: a f. carbonaria always produces f. carbonaria offspring, while f. typica does so only if both mates are f.typica.\n \n Since the color changes to the population of moths (first white to black, and then black back to white) have been demonstrated to have been caused by a change in the allele frequency in a population over time, this is an example of evolution. It isn't a \"preadaption\" that is induced by environment, or plasticity or the \"throwing of switches\". It is genetic.

   "It has been shown that animals change biologically without the need for RM + NS.\n\n \n I'm sorry I missed that one. Would you mind explaining how biological systems can manufacture new proteins and organic molecules without changes in thier DNA/RNA. I missed the class where they talked about spontaneous individual adaptation. \n \n I mean, isn't it great to know that animals instantly adapt! That's why there are never any albino specimens, you never get lambs born with 5 legs, you never get conjoined (sp?) twins, or any other form of genetic screw-up... Hold on a sec though....\n \n Plasticity allows animals to strech within the limits of their genome. That's why it's called plasticity. It implies streching around a central hard-coded point. If animals could instantly adapt to their surroundings (whatever they were) I imagine we'd be talking about fluidity. I also imagine we'd look like orgainic forms of the T-1000 (in our natural state).\n \n As a palaeontologist, I suggest you look at the fossil record for yourself, and then decide how complete it is, and whether you can see gradual evolution within it. You may or may not be aware that evolutionary lineages can be traced through the fossil record, not as a straight line, but more as a branching tree (analogy of Gould), and some of these seem to show slow modification over millenia. The horse is a good example of this, and whales also (though that's recently come under scruitany (sp?)).\n \n As for PE v. Gradualism, well it seems to me that punctuated gradualism is a reasonable suggestion, where animals evolve slowly most of the time, but react rapidly at instances of environmnetal stress. Indeed Gould and Eldrege seem to have suggested that (at least that's how I've always discussed it, and no one has shot me yet). PE does not suggest no evolution occurs during the equilibrium period, it just suggests spikes at times of crisis.\n \n \nMany evolutionists admit that animals only change when the environment changes\n\n \n Name them....\n \n \nHowever, you evolutionists still claim that it takes thousands/millions of years for animals to \"adapt\" to their environment....\n\n \n Who said that? I seem to recall stating that evolutionary change can occur in a few generations.\n \n \nAnd why is it that animals who don't often change their environments are the very same animals who havent \"evolved\" in millions of years...ie...crocodiles, sharks, bats, etc?\n\n \n Find out something before you post it. I suggest you look at the evolutionary lineage of the crocodile and the aligator (sp?). There's been more in their history than you know. \n \n Sharks have changed as their environment has changed. You're probably thinking that I'm nuts, and no shark has ever left the ocean. Well that's rubbish for bull sharks swim up the Amazon today, but it's more the fact that the ocean is not a constant environment. Temperature, salinities, oxygen concentrations and overall size of the water body have all changed in the history of the planet. If sharks were all supremely adapted to their environment and as perfect as they could be, there wouldn't be more than one species of shark. Ever heard of Charcarodon (Charcarinus?) megalodon? A 60 foot shark alive until the start of the last ice age. It ate whales, yet it has gone exinct and whales haven't. If animals could adapt instantly, the cold temperatures would not have bothered it, and Jaws would be a documentary rather than a horror. The animal would have survived as long as its food source, yet it hasn't. \n \n Bats are an area I don't know that much about. I know that there are many different types of bat, and that they all hunt in different ways (all of which they are ancestorally(sp?) adapted for). I have a link, pm me if you want it (I don't want to let a troll loose on a friend of mine).\n \n Animals are constantly evolving, but some gene alterations mean little in the long run and most of the others are not changes on the visual level. How can we tell by sight if one shark has a 1/1000th improvement in its electrical detection apperatus? If it grew another fin we'd notice, but not minor changes in internal systems, unless we examined the animal closely, and we can hardly cut up every shark in the see to get the range of genetic diversity within a species....\n \n Also you are playing on a major difference between biology and palaeontology. Palaeontologists can only erect morpho-species (that is to say species groups based on morphological data, size and shape of bones, specific constructions of bones, and other osteological features) and though we try our best, it's not possible to get the same level of detail as is possible with modern biological sampling. You can hardly stick a needle in a bit of rock and extract DNA. Therefore palaeospecies are (mostly) well grounded on morphological data, but we have to be careful constructing evolutionary lineages due to the difference between a modern genetic species and a fossil morpho-species (except where there is clear stratigraphic succession such as with the horse and the whale). Saying the fossil record does not support gradualism is like looking through an arrow slit from the outside and claiming to have seen the whole castle. In Lagerstatten (sites of exceptional or abundant preservation) some gradualistic changes can be observed particularly in insects (See Solnhofen).\n \n Your claims seem to boil down to the idea that animals can instantly change when stressed. You seem to claim that multiple individuals, indeed whole species can do this. Experiment time. Take a population of mice, and put them in an area where the walls are closing in. See if they suddenly become super strong, or if they modify thier brain size to create some sort of brake out of natural materials. This seems a logical extention of your theory. Remember death of any mice means that your theory has failed. Repeat it with birthing mice and see if the new-borns suddenly adapt to the situation. I'd lay a reasonable amount of money that you'd end up with mouse pate. (Please don't really do this, mice deserve better than to be sacrificed to unscientific stupidity)",

   "I'm sorry I missed that one. Would you mind explaining how biological systems can manufacture new proteins and organic molecules without changes in thier DNA/RNA.\n\n \n Strawman...ridiculous.\n \n \nPlasticity allows animals to strech within the limits of their genome. That's why it's called plasticity. It implies streching around a central hard-coded point. If animals could instantly adapt to their surroundings (whatever they were) I imagine we'd be talking about fluidity. I also imagine we'd look like orgainic forms of the T-1000 (in our natural state).)\n\n \n true...and that's all there is to \"evolution\" and you cannot prove otherwise. The point is that if an animal is able to morph the color, shape, size of his body, it could be misinterpreted in the fossil record by religiously-blinded atheists.\n \n \nAs a palaeontologist, I suggest you look at the fossil record for yourself, and then decide how complete it is, and whether you can see gradual evolution within it. You may or may not be aware that evolutionary lineages can be traced through the fossil record, not as a straight line, but more as a branching tree (analogy of Gould), and some of these seem to show slow modification over millenia. The horse is a good example of this, and whales also (though that's recently come under scruitany (sp?)).)\n\n \n Then if animals' fossils are more along the lines of a \"bush\" then how do you get gradualism out of that? Eldredge seems to indicate that stasis is a phenomenon caused by a lack of environmental changes. Thus animals change only when the environment changes. He gave Ice ages as an example. But sometimes (usually, actually) environments change quickly (ie..migration to new and different climates, new predators, diets etc.) Thus, if plasticity can have the same effect as adaptation, why do animals need to wait thousands of years for that silly process to unfold?\n \n \nAs for PE v. Gradualism, well it seems to me that punctuated gradualism is a reasonable suggestion, where animals evolve slowly most of the time, but react rapidly at instances of environmnetal stress. Indeed Gould and Eldrege seem to have suggested that (at least that's how I've always discussed it, and no one has shot me yet). PE does not suggest no evolution occurs during the equilibrium period, it just suggests spikes at times of crisis.)\n\n \n You seem to be admitting that the environment spurs rapid \"evolution\" -- as I just indicated.\n \n \n \nWho said that? I seem to recall stating that evolutionary change can occur in a few generations.)\n\n \n how? What mechanism? Have a neodarwin website to back that up? I thought you said you believed in gradualism....? You can't have it both ways.\n \n \nFind out something before you post it. I suggest you look at the evolutionary lineage of the crocodile and the aligator (sp?). There's been more in their history than you know. )\n\n \n Maybe so....I've heard differently.....Link?\n \n \n \n \nAlso you are playing on a major difference between biology and palaeontology. Palaeontologists can only erect morpho-species (that is to say species groups based on morphological data, size and shape of bones, specific constructions of bones, and other osteological features) and though we try our best, it's not possible to get the same level of detail as is possible with modern biological sampling. You can hardly stick a needle in a bit of rock and extract DNA. Therefore palaeospecies are (mostly) well grounded on morphological data, but we have to be careful constructing evolutionary lineages due to the difference between a modern genetic species and a fossil morpho-species (except where there is clear stratigraphic succession such as with the horse and the whale). Saying the fossil record does not support gradualism is like looking through an arrow slit from the outside and claiming to have seen the whole castle. In Lagerstatten (sites of exceptional or abundant preservation) some gradualistic changes can be observed particularly in insects (See Solnhofen).)\n\n \n give me an example of an air-tight fossil sequence that points to gradual changes over time. (don't bother with the horse...Eldredge has already shot that down....do you have his book, The Myths of Evolution?...maybe we can go through it together.)\n \n \nYour claims seem to boil down to the idea that animals can instantly change when stressed. You seem to claim that multiple individuals, indeed whole species can do this. Experiment time. Take a population of mice, and put them in an area where the walls are closing in. See if they suddenly become super strong, or if they modify thier brain size to create some sort of brake out of natural materials. This seems a logical extention of your theory. Remember death of any mice means that your theory has failed. Repeat it with birthing mice and see if the new-borns suddenly adapt to the situation. I'd lay a reasonable amount of money that you'd end up with mouse pate. (Please don't really do this, mice deserve better than to be sacrificed to unscientific stupidity)\n\n \n I don't claim that animals have super powers. All I claim is that they have morphological abilities -- obviously these are restricted by certain degrees. I suggest many animals can grow, shrink, change colors, change physiological features such as jaws, teeth, limb length, etc. in order to stay alive and adjust to external conditions. I don't believe this is disputed anywhere. And if this is indeed true, then it could give the illusion of \"evolution\" in the fossil record. The fact is you don't have many air-tight intermediate fossils -- when there should be billions of them -- so to claim gradualism is quite silly at this point.\n \n by the way...hang around and debate me for a while -- It's difficult finding people on the web who are knowledgeable like yourself.\n \n Another thing is this....I know very little about the fossil record. My main contention is with the mechanism of random mutations and natural selection -- of which even atheist evolutionists are trying to do something about because it is so lacking in the ability to bring about quick variations -- which obviously happen. But I'll be glad to talk about it all with you. I'm always up for learning new things. S\n \n http://biosingularity.wordpress.com/2006/02/04/scientists-evolve-a-complex-genetic-trait-in-the-laboratory\n \n (check out paragraphs 3, 4 and 5.)

A strawman is a false argument, or representation of a postion erected to be demolished to make one's argumenty appear stronger. (Correct me if I'm wrong). All I did there is point out a serious flaw in your idea. You claim that phenotypic plasticity (the amount of morphological difference between two members of the same species) allows spontaneous major redesign in times of crisis. You have to now explain how that is possible. Changes in the body are regulated by enzymes and protiens which are coded for by DNA/RNA. You have to explain how these changes can occur without changes in the DNA/RNA as you seem to be implying.\n \n \ntrue...and that's all there is to \"evolution\" and you cannot prove otherwise. The point is that if an animal is able to morph the color, shape, size of his body, it could be misinterpreted in the fossil record by religiously-blinded atheists.\n\n \n I can prove evolution. Pandion is the one with the references, however the fruit fly speciation experiment, the domestication of dogs from wolves and so on. Any modern DNA sampling can show changes in allelle frequencies in populations over time. That is evolution in definition. \n \n As to your point about animals spontaneously morphing, prove it. Show me a case where an animal spontaeously changed from one size and shape to another. I mean scientifically observed (and none of this conspiracy bull**** please, it gets tired quickly), where one individual modified its teeth, jaws, body size (apart from fat deposits) or overall colour (apart from animals like chameleons (sp) which are exapted for colour changing).\n \n \nThen if animals' fossils are more along the lines of a \"bush\" then how do you get gradualism out of that? \n\n \n A tree is a series of branches. Look along a brach and you'll see a gradual transition from trunk to twig, with branching coming off it.\n \n \nEldredge seems to indicate that stasis is a phenomenon caused by a lack of environmental changes. Thus animals change only when the environment changes. He gave Ice ages as an example.\n \n \n Well either Eldredge was wrong, or the text you are reading from is. As I said, evolution occurs all the time, however mass-speciation (the point at which many new species appear) may be driven by environmental change (actually probably driven by mass-extinctions freeing up ecological niches, which are themselves caused by some environmental reason)\n \n \nBut sometimes (usually, actually) environments change quickly (ie..migration to new and different climates, new predators, diets etc.) \n\n \n Here comes rapid evolution, and adapting to a rapidly changing environment is in itself a mechanism of natural selection.\n \n \nThus, if plasticity can have the same effect as adaptation, why do animals need to wait thousands of years for that silly process to unfold?\n\n \n You have a hang up on thousands of years! You seem to think that evolutionary change must take millenia to act. Evolutionary change has been observed in a few days (maybe even hours). Pandion has the reference on the IC bacteria with the evolution of the digestion mechanism. There is no need for animals to 'wait' for evolution to occur. Evolution works on generations and populations not within individuals. See the Giraffe/Acacia Arms Race (Red Queen Hypothesis).\n \n \nYou seem to be admitting that the environment spurs rapid \"evolution\" -- as I just indicated.\n\n \n I seem to admitting that because I am! The environment drives the mechanism of natural selection and therefore of course has a big impact on evolution. I do not however accept your hypothesis of individual plasticity. Provide some proof, and then I'll consider it.\n \n \nhow? What mechanism? Have a neodarwin website to back that up? I thought you said you believed in gradualism....? You can't have it both ways.\n\n \n Sigh. (Pandion please post the references once, or provide a link to where you last posted them. I don't have them and I can't find them... Thanks :) )\n \n As to the gradualism thing, you seem to be making a false dichotomy. Gould and Eldredge did not say that evolution stops during 'stasis', they merely said that speciation events concentrate around points of environmental crisis or stress.\n \n \nMaybe so....I've heard differently.....Link?\n\n \n From whom I wonder....\n \n Try looking for Dakosaurus, Mesozoic crocodilliforms and so on. Ever heard of this thing?  Sarcosuchus That link has a simplified evolutionary lineage on it as well.\n \n \ngive me an example of an air-tight fossil sequence that points to gradual changes over time. (don't bother with the horse...Eldredge has already shot that down....do you have his book, The Myths of Evolution?...maybe we can go through it together.)\n\n \n I don't have it, and Pandion assures me that it doesn't exist. I'll take his word for it, as the rest of his information has been accurate.\n \n Simply I can't give you an air tight sequence. We weren't there to observe it, and therefore we can't guarantee 100% accuracy. I can suggest the evolution of the whale and the evolution of the horse (read Bully for Brontosaurus by Gould to see what I mean). That doesn't mean that the ToE comes crashing down. It just means that scientific rigour forbids us from taking anything for certain without definate proof, and we don't have definate proof, only very strong evidence.\n \n \nI don't claim that animals have super powers. All I claim is that they have morphological abilities -- obviously these are restricted by certain degrees. I suggest many animals can grow, shrink, change colors, change physiological features such as jaws, teeth, limb length, etc. in order to stay alive and adjust to external conditions. I don't believe this is disputed anywhere. \n\n \n They can change them, but not in individual animals, only over the course of generations.... You've kinda taken a product of evolution and claimed it can all occur without any time at all, which doesn't happen. For example, if we put you or me in the Congo, we wouldn't suddenly turn into hairy ape like creatures able to swing through the trees in the manner of a gibbon, or be able to eat plants like a gorilla. I do know some people who look like chimps, but they are here in Portsmouth, and don't spend there time picking each others hair and eating termites....\n \n \nAnd if this is indeed true, then it could give the illusion of \"evolution\" in the fossil record. The fact is you don't have many air-tight intermediate fossils -- when there should be billions of them -- so to claim gradualism is quite silly at this point.\n\n \n Having held a conclusive transitional fossil I dispute the claim there aren't any (Simple GotG argument). That fossil was Archaeopteryx, which is so transitional, people who deny the existance transitionals keep switching it between dinosaurs and birds. There are more transitionals, however pointing them out merely leads to the claim that there are more gaps....\n \n That link you provided actually shot your own argument in the foot. The evolution of that dual colour (also seen in lizards) required a 10 generation turn-over before becoming marked. That was 10 generations of selective breeding. So it wasn't a individual change. The individuals at the end had the ability to perform that change, but that was due to exaptation based on genetic change over the generational turnover. It was an interesting article...\n \n \nAnother thing is this....I know very little about the fossil record.

But I'll be glad to talk about it all with you. I'm always up for learning new things.\n\n \n Well for a start stop assuming that all 'evolutionists' are atheists. You never learn anything with pre-concieved opinions, and it just gets annoying. I would suggest that Pandion is the one to talk to about genetic mutation. I'm a palaeontologist not a gene worker. \n \n Think about this though, if random mutations did not occur then albino forms would not occur, birth defects would not occur.

   "Methodist Evolutionist reporting, what do you need?\n\n \n A Methodist?

   "Well, gee marc, somehow your post seems to have escaped my notice until now. Nevertheless...\n\n \n Oh, I knew that - I knew I'd never get a last word like that one. \n \n \n \nFirst, notice how marc straps the goalposts to his back and takes off to Timbuktu:\n \n So originally one merely needs to be a theistic evolutionist, then one needs to be a rabid Kenneth Miller fan, else I'm lying. Riiight...\n\n \n LOL and if you'll check back to post #17 where ORIGINALLY the subject was Kenneth Miller, we'll see that goalposts weren't moved at all. \n \n \nHere an instance where jyoshy clearly articulates his acceptance of evolution.\n \n Is that not enthusiastic enough for you, marc? \n\n \n Out of context - I'm not going to waste time explaining it.\n \n \nHere is where jyoshu has an exchange with you regarding theistic evolution, where he more than hints that he accepts evolutionary theory. Four posts later, you explicitly acknowledge that you are aware of his views. You go on to say that you don't understand it, which leads us to the conclusion that most of us already suspected: If you don't understand it, you don't believe it. You don't understand evolution, so you don't believe it happens. You don't understand counterarguments, so you ignore them. You don't understand theistic evolutionists, so you pretend they don't exist. After all, this is easier than actually thinking or backing up one's position. \n\n \n You misrepresented that exchange really well, were you hoping I wouldn't go back and check it out? Jyoshu and I had several exchanges there. You reference post #97. Post #114 went partially like this;\n \n \nOriginally Posted by marc9000 \n As a Christian, I believe that direct admonition concerned the rest of the Bible. I can't imagine what else it would concern. What does a theistic evolutionist think it concerns? That it's not all that important - just like an atheist? \n\n \n \n \nI'm not going to get into a verse-by-verse exposition with you here........ \n\n \n He obviously didn't want to discuss it much, and that's fine, he and I are usually in agreement.\n \n My last line in post #119 went like this; \nScience is political. Haven't I shown that it can be elevated beyond the reach of the political process - do you now better understand why I get nervous? \n\n \n THAT is what our exchange was about - why some Christians get nervous at the philosophy of todays atheism and how it affects politics. He never responded further.\n \n \n \nNow, do I need to track down Jo Bennett's too, or can we just trust that your window-dressing denial has been exposed? I'm thinking the latter. \n\n \n I'm thinking the former, maybe I can expose your dishonesty there too, if I feel like taking the time that is. \n \n \n \nI'm incredulous that you think I'm implying that any Catholics out-and-out \"reject the book of Genesis and support the politics of atheism.\" Well, not really all that incredulous.. After all, you've shown gross incomprehension before...\n\n \n Here's how it went;\n \n \nOriginally Posted by marc9000 \n I'm not incredulous because Miller isn't here, I'm incredulous that not a single one of the \"millions of other religious evolutionists\" are here. \n\n \n \n.....Simply put, marc is now \"incredulous\" that there are any Catholics. \n\n \n In Kenneth Miller's public action that I've seen, he rejects the book of Genesis and supports the politics of atheism, and any time I mention him, you equate ALL Catholics with him. \n \n \n \nIn any case, chaoticgnome is here, so there's one more person you can pretend doesn't exist.\n\n \n Yes, you need all the help you can get....we'll find out if chaoticgnome is a more mature debator than you.

(See also below.)\n \n \nI may have more questions, but I won't waste anymore time on you unless I think you've attempted to answer these two in a sincere way.\n\n If you're looking for serious answers, maybe you should ask serious questions. You know, ones that don't commit the fallacy of the \"complex question\".\n \n \n \nLOL and if you'll check back to post #17 where ORIGINALLY the subject was Kenneth Miller, we'll see that goalposts weren't moved at all.\n\n Yes, everybody, go back to post 17 where Collin clearly includes the \"millions of other religious evolutionists,\" just as marc does here. In fact, if the reader cares to review, in that post marc claims that no religious evolutionists post here on 4forums, yet here they are...\n \n \nOut of context - I'm not going to waste time explaining it.\n\n What's this? No inane excuse? No rabid denial? No \"reinterpreting\" jyoshu's statement to justify your lies? Gee marc, you're slipping. But hey, if you're content to let the readers follow my links and see for themselves, so am I.\n \n \nYou misrepresented that exchange really well, were you hoping I wouldn't go back and check it out? Jyoshu and I had several exchanges there.\n\n Are you kidding? I included links for everyone to go back and look. Heck, I re-read the thread from that point. It was great to see you squirm and reveal your bias and ignorance in post after post after post. Why would I hope you didn't go back? Once again, I invite everyone to go back and read that thread. It's a goodie.\n \n \nHe obviously didn't want to discuss it much, and that's fine, he and I are usually in agreement.\n\n Whether or not he wants to discuss it does not mean he's not a member or that he doesn't post, and it certainly doesn't mean that he doesn't exist, which seems to be a staple argument for you. Perhaps he knows you won't discuss the scientific merits instead of appealing to the Bible and serving up your own version of fundamentalist righteous indignation. After all, it's quite clear that he and you are certainly not in agreement here.\n \n \nTHAT is what our exchange was about - why some Christians get nervous at the philosophy of todays atheism and how it affects politics. He never responded further.\n\n Regardless of what you felt the main issue of the exchange was, you clearly acknowledge that you know that he's a theistic evolutionist (as you do once again in your most recent post!), yet you then claimed that no theistic evolutionists post on this board.\n (Or maybe jyoshu realized that having a serious discussion regarding science and religion with you was probably pointless as soon as you started talking about things that happened \"hundreds of trillions of centuries ago.\")\n \n \nIn Kenneth Miller's public action that I've seen, he rejects the book of Genesis and supports the politics of atheism, and any time I mention him, you equate ALL Catholics with him.\n\n Right, his book Finding Darwin's God was either totally private or promoted atheism. Get real. How about you buy a copy of it like I did and actually read it?\n \n \nYes, you need all the help you can get....we'll find out if chaoticgnome is a more mature debator than you. I suspect he may be after reading some of his other posts, but being more mature than you isn't exactly a feat of gigantic proportions.\n\n marc has now resorted to insulting my debating (by calling it immature, no less). Is this really a bad thing for me? I don't think so. Remember, marc thinks that fallacies are perfectly legit, that pointing out fallacies should be forbidden, and that responding substantively to points is foolishly unnecessary... (Besides, if such an immature debator can kick marc's XXX so handily and so consistently, why does he think having a better one going against him will turn out any better?)",

No doubt you can quote me any number of bible verses that can be interpreted to mean that dinosaurs existed in biblical times, or that the world was created in seven 24 hour days, but these words are not absolute and can be interpreted in many different ways. This fact is self evident because there are so many different denominations of Christianity that interpret the scripture differently. By what right do you claim that I am the one taken in by hollow philosophy? My philosophy is backed by the scientific method and constant reexamination.

It's possible the quote escapes me, but I'm pretty sure Jesus didn't rant about creation.\n \n \n \nI may have more questions, but I won't waste anymore time on you unless I think you've attempted to answer these two in a sincere way.\n\n \n How very magnaminous of you to offer this opportunity to me. Unfortunatly, from where I'm sitting, the burden of proof is yours. In science, a theory must be able to explain natural phenomena and make accurate predictions about the world. As we develop, theories are continuously refined to better fit the data presented to us. This is why Newtonian physics are still taught. They are technically correct, they just have to be further refined in special circumstances, when relativity comes to play. Explain to me why the theory of evolution, which is still the best theory that both explains biological phenomena and makes predictions for future developments, should be overturned? It would require powerful evidence, almost as powerful as what was required to modify Newtonian Physics. Quotes noting some random anecdote about carbon dating does not create a viable alternative",

Enviroment includes other species, prey, predator, compeitor and species that are not in the direct food chain. The arms race between the newt and the snake is part of the enviroment.

The Jewish Bible is Old Testament only, (arranged differently) and the Roman Catholics have the Apocraphal books included.

Your sig looks to me like it mocks God.\n \n \n My philosophy is backed by the scientific method and constant reexamination. \n\n \n Each generation, maybe somewhat subconsiously, thinks it knows it all. Some notable person (sometime around the year 1900) proclaimed that \"everything that can be invented has been invented.\" Science today thinks it now knows enough to proclaim what's wrong with the Bible. The Piltdown man hoax lasted for about 40 years. Other scientific hoaxes have stayed around for long periods of time. Where's the guarantee that no scientific hoax is having theories built upon it today? There's far more money in science today than ever before.\n \n \n Your philosophy cannot ever be questioned, because you know it in your heart it is truth and others should know this naturally as well. It must feel good to be so sure of yourself. \n\n \n You see something elevated in me, over others, in being \"sure of myself\"? Maybe you should check the posts of about 15 arrogant atheists on this board and see how sure of themselves they are. Or read up at talkorigins.\n \n \n \nThe main thrust of Colossians 2:8 is that philosophy from man is inferior to philosophy from Christ. Until you can show to me that Christ claimed the world was created in its exact form with all animals made exactly as they needed to be, then your philosophy is no less worldy than mine. \n\n \n How about Christ mentioning the flood? Matthew 24:38. Jesus directly referenced the flood. Today's science proclaims that it did not happen. As a theistic evolutionist, please give me a detailed explanation of that.\n \n \n From my experiences, Christ was far more interested in protecting the innocent and making sure people did what was right. It's possible the quote escapes me, but I'm pretty sure Jesus didn't rant about creation. \n\n \n I've already referenced where he said something about creation. (in an earlier post) How many times would he have to say it before theistic evolutionists would believe it?\n \n \n \nHow very magnaminous of you to offer this opportunity to me.

   "Then why is science so eager to involve itself with theology? Why does science constantly proclaim non guidance as fact?\n\n \n Not at all. Science normally doesn't care what theology thinks. Science gets involved when theology oversteps its bounds, such as placing non-scientific intelligent design into classrooms. When theology starts to engage in fraud and dishonest behavior about the secular world, science moves into to correct them. There's a reason why the Catholic Church has largely accepted science, they are sick and tired of being corrected left and right. \n \n \nIt's wrong when it comes to an anti Biblical conclusion that it doesn't have enough evidence for.\n\n \n Since when did disproving literal creation disprove the bible? The bible is a book of morals and values, not a accurate historical timeline. Besides, if the other Christians sects had managed to gain power instead of the RCC, we'd have a very different view of the bible. There would be no discussion on genesis as there would be no genesis in the bible if Marcion Christians won. \n \n \nBut science goes beyond it's secular bounds when it claims there was no flood, or that man and monkeys share a common ancestor, or that life is non guided.\n\n \n There was no global flood. There's no evidence whatsover of a flood of such size. While there are cultural stories abound of floods, very few have the same era, the same scope and the same place, much less the same method of how the waters came, for what reasons and what happened afterward. There is evidence of a large flood in the mediterian and the caspian, but that's heresy in literal creationism. How is stating something that is proven overstepping its bounds? Man and monkey share a common ancestor. Life is guided, by mutuations and enviromental pressures. What's your point?\n \n \natheism - atheists have a right to say it, to champion it however they choose, as long as it's done no more publicly - no more established- than any other ideology.\n\n \n Come again? How is evolution athiestic when millions of metaphorical jews and christians accept it? How can it be athestic when diests accept it? How can it be atheistic when Buddhists, Shintos and other religions accept it?\n \n You seem to think that if you're not a literalist jew, muslim or christain, you're godless, that's completely asinine.\n \n \n\n You and atheists on this board seem to get along well. Your sig looks to me like it mocks God.\n\n \n Not really. It mocks falsehood and the ignorant attitudes of superority that derive from it. \n \n \n\n Each generation, maybe somewhat subconsiously, thinks it knows it all. Some notable person (sometime around the year 1900) proclaimed that \"everything that can be invented has been invented.\"\n\n \n Well, that's French thinking, what did you expect? \n \n \nScience today thinks it now knows enough to proclaim what's wrong with the Bible.\n\n \n Well, literal interpretations of the bible. Fundemntalism is stupid and should be undermined. \n \n \nThe Piltdown man hoax lasted for about 40 years. Other scientific hoaxes have stayed around for long periods of time. Where's the guarantee that no scientific hoax is having theories built upon it today? There's far more money in science today than ever before.\n\n \n There's also ridicule from being caught not to mention peer review from thousands of scientists who have no incentive to deny or support.\n Besides, most of the money is in practical science, largely consumer products. Monserat paid off many scientists in the FDA to get them to deem hormone additives that were banned in canada and Europe for leaking bacteria filled #### into US milk \"safe,\" and the republicans allowed that ****. Scientists in the energy industry are rounitely paid off to write articles support dangerous energy industry policies. This happens in mining as well. But academic science has relatively little to gain. \n \n \n \nAccurate predictions, yes. In 1912, man was smart enough to build the Titanic, and stupid enough to let it sink. In almost 100 years, I don't see man as having improved himself enough to start declaring what's true and what's false about the Bible - what happened long before recorded history.\n\n \n How is a engineering failure the same as a science failure? Furthermore, the titantic failed for a simple reason: its bulkheads were 10 or so feet too short. How you argue that equates to total lack of ability is really asinine. \n \n \n\n There's not enough powerful evidence for it, to directly overturn the flood event, or the belief that life is guided by God. Does theistic evolution believe that the entire book of Genesis should be overturned? How would the rest of the Bible hold up with it missing? Matthew 24:38 would have to go, wouldn't it?\n\n \n Again, you appear to have no understanding that christians aren't all literalists",

   "I'll respond to this one first, since it's going to require me to repeat something from memory. (with paraphrasing since I don't remember it word for word) I saw it months ago but I don't remember where. I think I can remember the basics. First, this quickly found link;\n \n http://www.christiananswers.net/q-abr/abr-c001.html\n \n \n \n Now for this little story - fictional, but it helps make the point.\n \n Two women (friends) are part of a group at a bus stop waiting for a bus. As the bus pulls up, the crowd surges forward and one of the women loses her balance, and is hit by the bus. Injured seriously, but not life threatening. As the ambulance is called by cell phone, her friend calls the injured womans husband at work to let him know what's going on. \"Don't come here, the ambulance will be here and gone by the time you would get here - I'll call you as soon as we get to the hospital - not sure which hospital yet.\" The anxious husband hangs up the phone and waits - a full 45 minutes goes by before the police show up at his job in person! \"We're sorry sir, but we regret to inform you that your wife has just been killed in a car accident.\" (husband) \"But they said her injuries weren't that serious - that the bus wasn't moving all that fast.\" (police) \"Sorry sir, the injuries were quite serious - she held on a short time, but didn't make it. There was no bus involved.\" \n \n No bus involved?? What would you expect the husband to think? Why can't these stupid people get their stories straight? \n \n As it turns out, both stories were exactly right. While waiting for the ambulance at the bus stop, someone in a car offers to take the woman to the hospital before the ambulance gets there. On the way to the hospital, that car wrecks and the woman is killed. Without that information, how could anyone not immediately think that one story had to be wrong? \n \n I suspect a lot of seeming \"Biblical contradictions\" have explanations like this.\n\n \n Genesis Chapter 1 verse 11; 20-27\n \n\n 11 Then God said, \"Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds.\" And it was so. 12 The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. 13 And there was evening, and there was morning-the third day. \n \n 20 And God said, \"Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky.\" 21 So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living and moving thing with which the water teems, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. 22 God blessed them and said, \"Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth.\" 23 And there was evening, and there was morning-the fifth day. \n \n 24 And God said, \"Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, creatures that move along the ground, and wild animals, each according to its kind.\" And it was so. 25 God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. \n \n 26 Then God said, \"Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, [b] and over all the creatures that move along the ground.\" \n \n 27 So God created man in his own image, \n in the image of God he created him; \n male and female he created them. \n\n \n Genesis Chapter 2 verse 7-8 and 18-19\n \n\n 7And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. \n \n 8And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed. \n \n 18And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him. \n \n 19And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof. \n\n \n In the first story, animals are made first and man second. In the second story, man is made first and animals follow. This isn't a diffeent point of view, it's two different causalities. I don't think your example applies in this situation",

Does theistic evolution believe that the entire book of Genesis should be overturned? How would the rest of the Bible hold up with it missing?

First, you mix up science and religion. \n\n \n Science and religion are mixed. Each side, each worldview accuses the other side of mixing them, but there's no question they are mixed. There is a political conflict between them. If there wasn't, this forum wouldn't exist, constant court battles about separation of church and state wouldn't exist, talkorigins wouldn't have dozens of pages devoted to the critisism of creation, etc. Surely you agree with that. \n \n \nIt has to do with your insistance on me telling you how one can be a 'theistic evolutionist.' The term implies that the two relationships are somehow connected, but in fact they describe a person just as the term theistic capitalist does. The first term describes a person as having religious beliefs, the second term refers to a secular concept that person believes in. \n\n \n And many are using that secular concept to try to disprove religious beliefs - a secular concept politically conflicts with religious beliefs. Atheism had been around since the beginning of the establishment of the U.S. government, but only recently has become notably politically active. That's because until only recently, it hasn't been associated with any kind of education. It's been a, \"Duh, if I don't see it I don't believe it\" mentality. I believe it was Richard Dawkins who said something like \"evolution enables one to be an intellectually fullfilled atheist.\" What atheist doesn't want to be intellectually fullfilled? How many subjects to they have to run to for it? ONE? Science? Religion has always been about education - history, archeology, etc. Each belief system involves knowledge, and they conflict.\n \n \n Evolution does not counter the important points of religion. \n\n \n That zinger is made by atheism and theistic evolution all the time on these forums, and I've shown it to be so wrong many times. \"Evolution's\" attempts to counter religion is so widespread, I can show it with a different example everytime I see it. Richard Dawkins (a scientist / rabid atheist) wrote a book called \"The Blind Watchmaker\", where he attempts to use science to promote atheism. How about this one from talkorigins;\n \n \nThe process of evolution leads naturally to social animals such as humans developing ethical principles such as the Golden Rule. \n\n \n http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA001.html\n \n Are you going to say that doesn't counter an important point of religion? Is atheism, and theistic evolution in perfect harmony on that statement, like they seem to be on everything else? Is there anything that atheists and theistic evolutionist disagree on, politically?\n \n Do theistic evolutionists get upset if school children are taught the above proclamation? It's secular, so the ACLU doesn't. You see, when church and state are separated, atheism and state are combined. Government cannot be completely neutral when it comes to some political decisions.\n \n \n \n The two of us arguing over how to interpret those lines in Genesis shows that the bible can be interpreted in many different ways and not all of them have to be a literal interpretation. The theory of evolution describes how animals were created. It makes no moral judgements at all. That is left to men. \n\n \n There is a difference between the disagreements in interpreting some details that are left out of the Bible such as the age of the earth, and proclaming that something clearly described in the Bible such as the worldwide flood, DID NOT HAPPEN. Suppose science decides to study the Red Sea to see if it was parted like the Bible describes, and determines it was not parted. Suppose science studies to see if Soddom and Gomorrah were actually destroyed as the Bible describes, and determines that they weren't. Would theistic evolution be comfortable with these determinations? Maybe if those cites weren't destroyed, maybe there was no immorality going on there? Maybe \"if it feels good, do it\" isn't such a bad philosophy after all? How does theistic evolution draw such a hard, distinguishing line between Biblical history, and behavior standards? Since they've not bothered to establish a church denomination, it makes me wonder how much they love the Lord their God with all their heart, with all their soul, and with all their might.\n \n \n \nYour second problem lies with how you interpret science.\n \n This statement runs counter to how science works. There has to be evidence to support a flood event, not a lack of evidence denying it. According to science, the bible is not a reliable source of data. You need observable phenomena, eyewitness testimony is not enough. \n\n \n Something that happened thousands of years ago cannot be ovserved by science. Science has taken it upon itself to be the superior form of knowledge - to throw out written history, and demand only scientific proof for anything it wants. There has to be legitimate doubt about written history for any entity to demand proof, more than just a desire to prove atheism.\n \n I think science is limited by two things, in it's ravenous appetite to re-write history;\n \n 1) Science can't directly observe the past. It's conclusions are no better than the imperfect humans worldviews who reach them. \n \n 2) The main one - those who represent science have no way of knowing that they have all the information that exists. It goes back to my previous point about each generation thinking it knows it all - you didn't address it.\n \n \n \nWhen I suggested you may wish to overturn science, you replied.\n \n I'm not exactly sure how highly you grade the Thanksgiving holiday, but I'm more intrigued about your statement that science should be kept to its proper limits. This would likely be the same sort of arguement Galileo was given as to why people should ignore the truth staring at them through a telescope. \n\n \n Could it be similar to the argument made by atheists 80 or so years ago, about the truth staring at them in the bones of Piltdown man? Why is TODAY'S generation the one that finally knows it all? \n \n \n Historically, religion has resisted many attempts to redefine how the world works, and invariably they have had to adapt to science. \n\n \n Historically, atheism has resisted new evidence since Darwin, of just how mathematically improbable naturalistic evolution is, and they refuse to adapt - to consider other testable, repeatable, secular subjects like math, or the new paths of science that the subject of I.D. can bring. \n \n \n In all of this redefinition of the world, however, the moral code and recommendations for how to live a good life remain intact. This is what is truly important in religion, and that is where my theism lies.\n\n \n You don't see any conflict? You don't see science involving itself with it? \n \n Here's some more scientific wisdom from talkorigins;\n \n \nEvolution does not teach that humans are animals; biology in general does (and so does the Bible, in Ecclesiastes 3:18-21). More specifically, humans are a species of primate, which is a category of mammal, which is a category of vertebrate, which is a category of animal. This was known more than 2000 years ago. \n\n \n As a theistic evolutionist, surely you know that the book of Ecclesiastes has a purpose - to investigate life as a whole and teach that in the final analysis life is meaningless without the proper respect and reverence for God.

   "That zinger is made by atheism and theistic evolution all the time on these forums, and I've shown it to be so wrong many times.\n\n No, the claim that you think you've shown to be wrong so many times is that evolution isn't atheistic. The two claims are not identical. Maybe you didn't realize this because you think that the only religion besides yours is atheism.\n \n \nSomething that happened thousands of years ago cannot be ovserved by science.\n\n Wrong. We can observe astronomical events that happened thousands, millions, or billions of years ago because the light from those events is getting to us now. We can observe modern results of events that happened thousands, millions, or billions of years ago.\n What is asinine is that you make this claim while simultaneously insisting that your favorite book must be correct, even though most of the events described therein supposedly happened thousands of years ago, left no observable evidence, are contradictory to each other, and would be rejected in any context but its own. You're a big plan of special pleading, I see...\n \n \nHistorically, atheism has resisted new evidence since Darwin, of just how mathematically improbable naturalistic evolution is, and they refuse to adapt - to consider other testable, repeatable, secular subjects like math, or the new paths of science that the subject of I.D. can bring.\n\n Start a thread about the improbability of naturalistic evolution. Go ahead, marc. Make some solid claims instead of these backhanded allusions.\n \n \n \nKenneth Miller worked closely with atheists to help achieve victory in the Dover Pa. I.D. case. POLITICS. Maybe it's not your business what this discussion is about. Are you a moderator who doesn't believe in free speech? Or are you just another atheist who is nervous about what this discussion might expose?\n\n Yes, marc, we're \"nervous.\" That's why we fail to reply to you, never challenge you to support your assertions, never dare you to start a new thread for a new topic, and never ask you to participate in other threads.\n You get your XXX kicked here on a regular basis and come back for more. Hey, that's fine, as far as I'm concerned; more fun for me. For you to accuse \"atheists\" of being afraid of this discussion is the height of stupidity.

   "Collin and electrolyte dealt with a lot of your arguements, so I won't go over every point you made.\n \n \nScience and religion are mixed. Each side, each worldview accuses the other side of mixing them, but there's no question they are mixed. There is a political conflict between them. If there wasn't, this forum wouldn't exist, constant court battles about separation of church and state wouldn't exist, talkorigins wouldn't have dozens of pages devoted to the critisism of creation, etc. Surely you agree with that.\n\n \n I think that there is political conflict over evolution just as there is political conflict for an amendment to burn the American Flag. There have been several attempts to get this, but there really isn't any major surge of flag burning to justify an alteration to the consitution (in my opinion, of course)\n \n There are lots of political conflicts based on non issues. The fact people fight about something doesn't prove that there is an actual conflict.\n \n \n \n \nAnd many are using that secular concept to try to disprove religious beliefs - a secular concept politically conflicts with religious beliefs. Atheism had been around since the beginning of the establishment of the U.S. government, but only recently has become notably politically active. That's because until only recently, it hasn't been associated with any kind of education. It's been a, \"Duh, if I don't see it I don't believe it\" mentality. I believe it was Richard Dawkins who said something like \"evolution enables one to be an intellectually fullfilled atheist.\" What atheist doesn't want to be intellectually fullfilled? How many subjects to they have to run to for it? ONE? Science? Religion has always been about education - history, archeology, etc. Each belief system involves knowledge, and they conflict.\n\n I would like to think everyone would prefer to be intellectually fulfilled. Claiming a atheist only listens to science is misleading. There are plenty of liberal arts majors who are also atheists. Also, history and archeology are more scientific than theistic these days. The reason for this is that theism looks for certainty while science looks for the best solution at the time. In thre realm of history and archeology or any of the sciences, certainty is impossible.\n \n \nIs there anything that atheists and theistic evolutionist disagree on, politically?\n\n Oh, maybe you could argue that atheists don't feel that God is the source of morality. The concept that evolution is the process by which moral values were placed in our physical forms does not invalidate God's involvement. We live comfortably with the knowledge that God is not physically effecting miracles on a daily basis. Things seem to play out in a naturalistic way without any outside control. Why do you still insist that God was more directly involved in an earlier time?\n \n \nYou see, when church and state are separated, atheism and state are combined. Government cannot be completely neutral when it comes to some political decisions.\n\n No government can be neutral about anything, but we do the best we can. You are creating a false dilemma for me, arguing that religion must be involved in government else atheists will place their agenda into government instead. Try living in a country where church and state are not seperated. Want to know a few good examples? Saudi Arabia, Iran, Palistine, Lebanon.\n \n \n \nThere is a difference between the disagreements in interpreting some details that are left out of the Bible such as the age of the earth, and proclaming that something clearly described in the Bible such as the worldwide flood, DID NOT HAPPEN. Suppose science decides to study the Red Sea to see if it was parted like the Bible describes, and determines it was not parted. Suppose science studies to see if Soddom and Gomorrah were actually destroyed as the Bible describes, and determines that they weren't. Would theistic evolution be comfortable with these determinations? Maybe if those cites weren't destroyed, maybe there was no immorality going on there? Maybe \"if it feels good, do it\" isn't such a bad philosophy after all? How does theistic evolution draw such a hard, distinguishing line between Biblical history, and behavior standards? Since they've not bothered to establish a church denomination, it makes me wonder how much they love the Lord their God with all their heart, with all their soul, and with all their might.\n\n And here, once again you remind us of the crux of your arguement's weakness. What if Sodom and Gomorrah were never destroyed? What if they never existed and were an amalgam of older legends that became intersperced into Jewish theism. Does this concept somehow invalidate the point of the story? The majority of the morals I learned as a child were first introduced me through Aesop. The fact that animals don't talk doesn't make the moral lessons any less valid.\n \n \n \n \nSomething that happened thousands of years ago cannot be ovserved by science. Science has taken it upon itself to be the superior form of knowledge - to throw out written history, and demand only scientific proof for anything it wants. There has to be legitimate doubt about written history for any entity to demand proof, more than just a desire to prove atheism.\n\n This was addressed before, but I'd like to point out that this is false. Astronomy observes things that happened millions of years ago. Fossil records give us clues as to what happened in the past. They aren't always impeccable, but neither is a chemical reaction on a bench.\n \n \n1) Science can't directly observe the past. It's conclusions are no better than the imperfect humans worldviews who reach them. \n \n 2) The main one - those who represent science have no way of knowing that they have all the information that exists. It goes back to my previous point about each generation thinking it knows it all - you didn't address it.\n\n 1. addressed above\n 2. Science have a perfect way of knowing: you never have all the information that exists. Each generation thinks it knows it all because we are usually an arrogant race. One branch of humanity that is an exception, however, is scientists. Scientists have seen how previous theorys were later refined or rejected and are quite accepting of the fact what we now know to be true will eventually be further refined. I had one professor who was wondering what physics breakthrough would show the problems of relativity.\n \n \n \nAs a theistic evolutionist, surely you know that the book of Ecclesiastes has a purpose - to investigate life as a whole and teach that in the final analysis life is meaningless without the proper respect and reverence for God. Are you comfortable when a scientist misrepresents the Bible to make a scientific claim?\n\n Yes, Ecclesiastes shows that reverence for God is important in life, but I didn't see that denied in the quote you showed me. The quote says that humans are animals. Can you deny this? We have 99% of the same genetic material as chimpanzees. We have 70% of the same DNA as yeast. How does our relations to animals make our accomplishments any less amazing?",

Go ahead, marc.\n \n In marc's world, it does. It's called willful ignorance. He's a seasoned expert.\n\n \n As I said once before, I'm having a discussion with you. I do remember asking you if militant atheists answering questions for you bothered you, so I guess I now have my answer. The fact remains that for you and I to have a fair discussion as theists, I cannot be completely sidetracked by atheist comments that I have no idea if you find relevent. So as I said, if they make a point that you find relevent, you need to copy/paste it, or of course, rephrase it to me any way you wish. But I will address something they said, each of them saying it in a slightly differnt way;\n \n \nYou get your XXX kicked here on a regular basis and come back for more. \n\n \n \nThat's why your attempt to change the subject from the authenticity and existence of theistic evolutionists to the politics of strife among evolutionists and certain theists has failed. \n\n \n On these two, both of them declared that I've not succeeded in in this debate with you. But it isn't over; obviously it's far from over if you stay with me - we've barely touched actual theism yet. Yet electrolyte and collin came to a conclusion long before all evidence was in. Could it be that evolutionist scientists similarly tend to be too hasty in coming to a conclusion concerning evolution, even before all evidence has been examined? Now you may say that qualified evolution scientists are far more mature and knowledgeable than electrolyte and collin, and of course you'd have a very valid point. But since you trust those two to answer questions for you, would you make that claim? \n \n \n \nI think that there is political conflict over evolution just as there is political conflict for an amendment to burn the American Flag. There have been several attempts to get this, but there really isn't any major surge of flag burning to justify an alteration to the consitution (in my opinion, of course)\n\n \n The conflict over the flag is one, comfined issue - no comparison. The political conflict over evolution can penetrate just about all of politics, from what freedoms we do and do not have, how moral we are, how we determine medical procedures, the definition of marriage, - countless other things. \n \n \nThere are lots of political conflicts based on non issues. The fact people fight about something doesn't prove that there is an actual conflict. \n\n \n It doesn't? So a \"fight\" and a \"conflict\" are two completely different things? They both involve two opposing forces, so word games aren't going to help you here. Based on what you say about this, we have much more ground to cover on it.\n \n \n \nI would like to think everyone would prefer to be intellectually fulfilled. Claiming a atheist only listens to science is misleading. There are plenty of liberal arts majors who are also atheists. Also, history and archeology are more scientific than theistic these days. The reason for this is that theism looks for certainty while science looks for the best solution at the time. \n\n \n Why shouldn't history and archeology be applied equally to science and theism? They can both be applied in a secular way to what the Bible says. Theism looks for certainty in exactly the same way methodological, naturalistic scientists look for it in evolution.\n \n \n \n In thre realm of history and archeology or any of the sciences, certainty is impossible. \n\n \n Impossible to different degrees. A hands-on finding of an archeological artifact that corresponds to a Biblical event is much more certain than naturalistic proclamations of an event on earth that happened billions of years ago. \n \n \n \nOh, maybe you could argue that atheists don't feel that God is the source of morality. \n\n \n And theistic evolutionists do? Why then, when a political conflict arises that divides Christians and Atheists, are theistic evolutionists almost always silent, or support the atheist point of view? I would think that theistic evolution would tend to be a 50/50 split, between Judeo Christianity and Atheism. Yet from their political positions, (and your almost complete lack of addressing theism in this discussion) indicates a split closer to 99/1. This ratio, combined with tricky atheists who pretend to be theists who are actually everything but, makes it quite clear to anyone with an open mind just how dangerous theistic evolution can be, especially when compared to many warnings in the Bible about how we should \"protect the innocent and make sure people do what is right.\" I'm sure there may be a few theistic evolutionists with little knowledge of the Bible who are sincere, and they have that right of course, but when they constantly side with atheism politically, others have a right to call them on it. \n \n \n \n The concept that evolution is the process by which moral values were placed in our physical forms does not invalidate God's involvement. We live comfortably with the knowledge that God is not physically effecting miracles on a daily basis. Things seem to play out in a naturalistic way without any outside control. \n\n \n Things SEEM that way yes, to those who know nothing about the Bible. Read Psalm 111 sometime, and notice that it's not dated for any certain time period. \n \n \n Why do you still insist that God was more directly involved in an earlier time? \n\n \n Because the Bible says so, Methodist. \n \n \nNo government can be neutral about anything, but we do the best we can. \n\n \n Hitler, Stalin, Lenin, Mao, Ho Chi Min, Tito, Napoleon, Breshnev, they all did the best they could - they were all non religious. \n \n \n You are creating a false dilemma for me, arguing that religion must be involved in government else atheists will place their agenda into government instead. \n\n \n Should we not learn from history - do the names above not indicate that perfection doesn't always occur when religion is absent?\n \n \n Try living in a country where church and state are not seperated. Want to know a few good examples? Saudi Arabia, Iran, Palistine, Lebanon. \n\n \n Atheists often compare the Muslim and Judeo Christian religions with each other, in order to downgrade Christianity. I see that theistic evolutionists can do the same thing. Our discussion is becoming fruitful. \n \n \n \n \nAnd here, once again you remind us of the crux of your arguement's weakness. What if Sodom and Gomorrah were never destroyed? What if they never existed and were an amalgam of older legends that became intersperced into Jewish theism. Does this concept somehow invalidate the point of the story? The majority of the morals I learned as a child were first introduced me through Aesop. The fact that animals don't talk doesn't make the moral lessons any less valid.\n\n \n If Sodom and Gomorrah were never destroyed, we'd probably have a lot more thiestic evolutionists among us, who don't fear God, and who politically side with atheists. If the Sodom and Gomorrah story was an amalgam, it would soften, and weaken the point of the story. Reality makes a far stronger point than make believe. If 9/11 never happened, and Hollywood made up that story for a movie, it wouldn't get near the ratings and attention as would an attempt to realistically portray in a movie what actually happened. \n \n \n \n \nThis was addressed before, but I'd like to point out that this is false. Astronomy observes things that happened millions of years ago. \n\n \n An observation of light, millions of lightyears away, is comparable to the observation of bilogical details on this planet? \n \n \n Fossil records give us clues as to what happened in the past. They aren't always impeccable, but neither is a chemical reaction on a bench. \n\n \n Nothing is impeccable in methodological, naturalistic evolution. \n \n \n \n1. addressed above \n\n \n Not addressed above, by you or the atheists, and it's increasingly hard to tell who's who. No details on how the observation of light far away tells us what happened on earth concerning living things.\n \n \n \n2. Science have a perfect way of knowing: you never have all the information that exists. Each generation thinks it knows it all because we are usually an arrogant race. One branch of humanity that is an exception, however, is scientists. \n\n \n So scientists are on a level above other humans - they are above arrogance? \n \n \n Scientists have seen how previous theorys were later refined or rejected and are quite accepting of the fact what we now know to be true will eventually be further refined. \n\n \n What we now KNOW, that God is not necessary for life to exist? The basic, unchanging faith of atheism?\n \n \n I had one professor who was wondering what physics breakthrough would show the problems of relativity.\n\n \n And there can't possibly be a single professor alive who isn't wondering if an empirical evidence breakthrough will show design in nature? \n \n \n \n \nYes, Ecclesiastes shows that reverence for God is important in life, but I didn't see that denied in the quote you showed me. The quote says that humans are animals. Can you deny this? We have 99% of the same genetic material as chimpanzees. We have 70% of the same DNA as yeast. How does our relations to animals make our accomplishments any less amazing?\n\n \n Other parts of the Bible say that man is more important than animals, and that man is to take dominion over animals. The above atheist scientist who quoted Ecclesiastes left those things out, because Atheism often politically conflicts with those things. (environmentalism is one example) Is theistic evolution in alliance with atheists on that subject too? \n \n You and the atheists both haven't addressed a few things yet. I'm curious about your sig - I still can't see any difference in how theistic evolutionists mock God as opposed to Atheists. Is there a difference?",

That's the beauty of truth, sometimes it has a tendency to inadvertantly slip out, doesn't it?\n\n \n \n Care to put money on that thought? Since you adore looking like a fool with every one of your posts, here's the punch line:\n \n 65.121.13.96\n \n Want my real address, too? When Electrolyte posts his IP with the utilization of www.whatismyipaddress.com, you can mail me $10,000 dollars.\n \n \n\n Please link me to a legitimate website that declares the Pope doesn't believe in creation. \n\n \n lol... Nice try. Believing in Creation (in the strictest sense, the mere creation of life) doesn't negate anything about the ToE.\n \n \nA week has now gone by, and chaoticgnome seems to have vacated, before we even got to first base in this discussion, concerning theism. Who was the other one? - jyoshu? That one was even shorter. (Clergy letter project - posts 97 - 119) I'm not putting either one of them down, but theistic evolution is VERY debatable.\n\n \n You could also just flatly confess that you know you've lost, but that works too. Theistic evolutionists exist. Debating them won't change that.\n \n The fact is, theistic evolutionists are not popular among atheists. Take, for example, the blog of PZ Meyers:\n \n Paryngula\n \n If that account is accurate (I trust Pat Hayes to be accurate, and I also have independent confirmation*), then that was a shot at the majority of biologists, and a declaration of common cause with creationists. They are \"shooting at the wrong target,\" but who is the right target? Why, those humanists, people like Richard Dawkins and anyone who challenges the role of religion. Go get 'em, Kansans! Hound those wicked atheists-they aren't the real scientists, after all. Real scientists believe in God and spirits and magic and etheric essences infused into souls by a phantasmal hominid, just like you do.\n \n Thanks, Dr Ken! I know what side you're on, now...it's you and the creationists, best friends 4ever! Did they promise to let you strike the match at the atheist-burning? \n \n There's more, too:\n \n More on that Miller guy\n \n Miller is an excellent speaker. He's persuasive, he's clear, he knows his science well, and he was an impressive participant in the conflict at Dover...and he was on the correct side. Here's the problem: he's wrong now.\n \n What he does is an insightful and lucid analysis of the problems with creationism, and then tries to wrap it up by identifying the source of the problem. Unfortunately, he places the blame in the laps of atheists, which is simply absurd. We've got fundamentalists straining to insert religious nonsense in the school curricula, and Miller's response is turn around and put the fault on those godless secular people who have antagonized good Christian folk, giving them perfectly reasonable cause to fear for their immortal souls. How dare we? It's only understandable that Kansans would object to godless interpretations of science!",

   "I apologize for being away, but several RL issues required my attention. I've got some area to cover, obviously\n \n \nIf you, as a theistic evolutionist think they \"dealt\" with them, we really are getting somewhere.\n\n \n This stems from the main issue between us. I would have not trouble having a militant atheist explain that the planets orbit around the sun. This is because that is an issue of science that observation can confirm. In this same sense, addressing questions of evolution itself, can be addressed by atheists because evolution is a science. I wouldn't wish an atheist to explain the proper way to live in my stead, as that is an issue of morality that is inexoribly linked to religion, and we would likely disagree in many different ways.\n \n \n \nAs I said once before, I'm having a discussion with you. I do remember asking you if militant atheists answering questions for you bothered you, so I guess I now have my answer. The fact remains that for you and I to have a fair discussion as theists, I cannot be completely sidetracked by atheist comments that I have no idea if you find relevent. So as I said, if they make a point that you find relevent, you need to copy/paste it, or of course, rephrase it to me any way you wish. But I will address something they said, each of them saying it in a slightly differnt way;\n\n \n If we wish to have a theistic discussion, let us discuss theology. Arguing that the bible is in some way a document of scientific merit, as you have several times previous mixes these issues.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn these two, both of them declared that I've not succeeded in in this debate with you. But it isn't over; obviously it's far from over if you stay with me - we've barely touched actual theism yet. Yet electrolyte and collin came to a conclusion long before all evidence was in. Could it be that evolutionist scientists similarly tend to be too hasty in coming to a conclusion concerning evolution, even before all evidence has been examined? Now you may say that qualified evolution scientists are far more mature and knowledgeable than electrolyte and collin, and of course you'd have a very valid point. But since you trust those two to answer questions for you, would you make that claim? \n\n \n Collin and electrolyte's tone aside, they do get their facts straight. When discussing details about evolution and the evidence that supports it, they hand out facts, even if they have little patience with people who don't read the evidence they provided. All that aside, to argue that they are immature cheapens the debate all around, if you feel they are acting petty, simply strive to rise above them and cary the discussion forward.\n \n \n \n \n \nThe conflict over the flag is one, comfined issue - no comparison. The political conflict over evolution can penetrate just about all of politics, from what freedoms we do and do not have, how moral we are, how we determine medical procedures, the definition of marriage, - countless other things.\n\n I still don't see how this is true. If we suddenly discovered tomorrow that we were in fact more closely related to potatos than to apes, would this in any way shift what it is that makes us human? I believe that our moral beliefs originate with God, but am unconcerned with the process he used to infuse us with them. \n \n \n \n \nIt doesn't? So a \"fight\" and a \"conflict\" are two completely different things? They both involve two opposing forces, so word games aren't going to help you here. Based on what you say about this, we have much more ground to cover on it.\n\n \n There is a definite difference between a fight and a conflict. I've had fights with people over how much milk I could drink before I would throw up. There is no pressing conflict of ideology over the critical mass of milk a stomach can take. People can fight about petty things, but a true conflict is something significant. The real question is which one is this thread based around?\n \n \n \n \n \nWhy shouldn't history and archeology be applied equally to science and theism? They can both be applied in a secular way to what the Bible says. Theism looks for certainty in exactly the same way methodological, naturalistic scientists look for it in evolution.\n\n Science is not so arrogant to assume it can ever achieve certainty. Evolution is not certain, just as atomic theory is not certain. Both, however, are backed up by a great wealth of experimental evidence that can not easily be overturned\n \n Theism looks for certainty where it can be achieved, in philosophy of ethics and morality. In these areas, principles can be achieved without empricism. Archeology and history do not have this convienance.\n \n \nImpossible to different degrees. A hands-on finding of an archeological artifact that corresponds to a Biblical event is much more certain than naturalistic proclamations of an event on earth that happened billions of years ago.\n \n \n This statement is a blip, the odds of some archaeologist finding an artifact versus proclamations is moot. What matters is what has been found.\n \n \n \nAnd theistic evolutionists do? Why then, when a political conflict arises that divides Christians and Atheists, are theistic evolutionists almost always silent, or support the atheist point of view? I would think that theistic evolution would tend to be a 50/50 split, between Judeo Christianity and Atheism. Yet from their political positions, (and your almost complete lack of addressing theism in this discussion) indicates a split closer to 99/1. This ratio, combined with tricky atheists who pretend to be theists who are actually everything but, makes it quite clear to anyone with an open mind just how dangerous theistic evolution can be, especially when compared to many warnings in the Bible about how we should \"protect the innocent and make sure people do what is right.\" I'm sure there may be a few theistic evolutionists with little knowledge of the Bible who are sincere, and they have that right of course, but when they constantly side with atheism politically, others have a right to call them on it.\n\n \n And what issues do you speak of that split Christianity and atheists? I can think of a few, but unless you addressed them individually we can't really discuss the reasons behind any given ratio. From a general point of view, I believe that the reason many theistic evolutionists side with the same side an atheist would side with, is such issues stem from instances where theists begin to intrude on issues of secular nature.\n \n \n \nThings SEEM that way yes, to those who know nothing about the Bible. Read Psalm 111 sometime, and notice that it's not dated for any certain time period. \n \n Because the Bible says so, Methodist. \n\n You really missed the point of my arguements here. Evolution does not deny the guiding hand of God, it simply observes his methods. When everything seems to play out naturally, it is because that is how God wishes it to work. In this way, science and religion are seperate yet compliment each other. I still cannot see why the two must conflict.\n \n \n \nHitler, Stalin, Lenin, Mao, Ho Chi Min, Tito, Napoleon, Breshnev, they all did the best they could - they were all non religious.\n\n This is guilt by association. So there were some atheistic leaders in the world (though, as previously mentioned by those dirty atheists, not all of the ones you listed were atheists.) This misses my point that governments strive to be neutral but always fall short by some degree. I'll save some space by not listing all the heavily religious leaders known for their atrocities.\n \n \n \nShould we not learn from history - do the names above not indicate that perfection doesn't always occur when religion is absent?\n\n This is a seperate issue. Leaders can be atheists, governments can be secular. Governments fail when religion is absent from the people. The USSR prohibited religious holidays, which ultimately undermined their people. To have a religious government is the same as having an atheist government, except the former would infringe on one religion fewer. A goverment need not be atheistic, it just must be free.\n \n \n \n \nAtheists often compare the Muslim and Judeo Christian religions with each other, in order to downgrade Christianity. I see that theistic evolutionists can do the same thing. Our discussion is becoming fruitful.\n\n \n Again you missed the point, but on this I am partly to blame as I did mention only muslim nations. The nations I listed were all ones where there is an official Religion. In Saudi Arabia you must be a Muslim to be a citizen. Notice I did not mention Turkey or Jordan. These are Islamic societies that do not enforce their religion and have much freer societies. Shall America become the newest nation where religion dominates government?\n \n \n \n \n \n \nIf Sodom and Gomorrah were never destroyed, we'd probably have a lot more thiestic evolutionists among us, who don't fear God, and who politically side with atheists. If the Sodom and Gomorrah story was an amalgam, it would soften, and weaken the point of the story. Reality makes a far stronger point than make believe. If 9/11 never happened, and Hollywood made up that story for a movie, it wouldn't get near the ratings and attention as would an attempt to realistically portray in a movie what actually happened.\n\n \n Your point on Sodom and Gomorrah is interesting. Do you mean to say we need to 'fear' God in the sense that he'll bring down his wrath when we sin? In Sunday school, I was always told that fearing God meant something different in the old days and implied belief.\n \n On the point of 9/11, well I won't get too much into it suffice to say that 9/11 may shed some valuable light on Sodom and Gomorrah. Already, many people disagree as to what actually happened. Some say that America was responsible, some argue it was a Jewish conspiracy, some state it was Al-Quieda but disagree on who is to blame. The recent show Path to 9/11 is poignent in how it has begun to redefine what actually happened, as many scenes directly contradict the 9/11 report. Over time, the true story becomes fogged in mystery. Imagine how Sodom and Gomorrah has changed since it was finally written down in the form we see it now.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nAn observation of light, millions of lightyears away, is comparable to the observation of bilogical details on this planet?\n to be brutally honest the observation of light is far more accurate and scientific, but biologists would disagree with me. We know more about the Andromedae galaxy than we do about our own minds, but given time, we learn more and more.\n \n \n \n \nNothing is impeccable in methodological, naturalistic evolution.\n\n Exactly, and it never will be. Any claim of an impeccable theory is laughed at, why do you think so many of the people on this board seem condescending?\n \n \n \n \nNot addressed above, by you or the atheists, and it's increasingly hard to tell who's who. No details on how the observation of light far away tells us what happened on earth concerning living things.\n\n \n Light from Andromeda can't tell us about Earth, but that wasn't the point. The point was to demonstrate that observations from millions of years ago are possible.\n \n \n \nSo scientists are on a level above other humans - they are above arrogance?\n\n No human is above arrogance and there are many examples of scientists who were extreme examples of arrogance. There are also countless examples of scientists clinging onto older notions. However, when push comes to shove, the majority of scientists will acknowledge new data and adjust their worldviews to it. No sufficient data has arrived to discount evolution, however. \n \n \n \n \nWhat we now KNOW, that God is not necessary for life to exist? The basic, unchanging faith of atheism?\n\n Now this is a theistic question on which I would agree with you, God is necessary for existance. However, if you mean that life requires a glowing hand decending from the sky to mold it out of dirt, then you and I have a disagreement.\n \n \n \n \nAnd there can't possibly be a single professor alive who isn't wondering if an empirical evidence breakthrough will show design in nature?\n\n \n I'm sure every professor has wondered about this. This actually is related to my sig, which you are so offended by. I'll bring it up again in a moment, when you mentioned it. \n \n \nOther parts of the Bible say that man is more important than animals, and that man is to take dominion over animals. The above atheist scientist who quoted Ecclesiastes left those things out, because Atheism often politically conflicts with those things. (environmentalism is one example) Is theistic evolution in alliance with atheists on that subject too?\n\n There are some people who are a little crazy and would argue that the life of the three ring snail is more important than humans, but these are few and far between. I for one fully believe we are above animals in many ways. However, I don't see how environmentalism works here. The problem with our damage to the environment is not that the Earth will die. The Earth will always bounce back and adapt, we just might be left on the wayside during the adaptation.\n \n \nYou and the atheists both haven't addressed a few things yet. I'm curious about your sig - I still can't see any difference in how theistic evolutionists mock God as opposed to Atheists. Is there a difference?\n\n \n Now is a great time to get on about the quote in my sig that you have felt mocks God. First, I recommend you read the Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy as it is a funny book from which this quote originated. The quote is actually more about the arrogance of man than mocking God.\n \n The book discusses the Babel Fish described as such:\n The Babel Fish is small, yellow and leech-like, and probably the oddest thing in the Universe. It feeds on brainwave energy not from its carrier, but from those around it. It absorbs all unconscious mental frequencies from this brainwave energy to nourish itself with. It then excretes into the mind of its carrier a telepathic matrix formed by combining the conscious thought frequencies with nerve signals picked up from the speech centres of the brain which has supplied them. The practical upshot of all this is that if you stick a Babel fish in your ear you can instantly understand anything said to you in any form of language. The speech patterns you actually hear decode the brainwave matrix which has been fed into your mind by your Babel fish. \n \n The Babel fish, by effectively removing all barriers to communication between different races and cultures, has caused more and bloodier wars than anything else in the history of creation.\n \n The book then expounds that the supreme uncertainty of such a useful creature ever evolving naturally proved the non-existance of God. It is at this point my sig begins, listing the basic theory. \n \n On another level, I think it speaks leaps and bounds that you are so affected by the sig, which is all in good fun and I imagine that God has quite the sense of humor. If you can't laugh at your beliefs every once and a while, then I worry if you are all that confident in them",

I would have not trouble having a militant atheist explain that the planets orbit around the sun. This is because that is an issue of science that observation can confirm. In this same sense, addressing questions of evolution itself, can be addressed by atheists because evolution is a science. \n\n \n But as a theist, you should understand that atheists use evolution as a weapon against religion - it's the only weapon they have. Being wary of false teaching is part of Christianity, as I pointed out in post #33 with the Col. 2:8 scripture. Doesn't it make sense that one of the few things worse than being taken in by false teaching would be to become a false teacher? I wonder if anyone ever asked Kenneth Miller that. Do you have his book - Finding Darwin's God?\n \n \n I wouldn't wish an atheist to explain the proper way to live in my stead, as that is an issue of morality that is inexoribly linked to religion, and we would likely disagree in many different ways. \n\n \n Yet you're okay with the way they proclaim that the knowledge of science overrides the historical accounts of Genesis? This undermines the basic way of reading the Bible, as described by Jesus and the Apostles in the New Testament.\n \n \n \n \nIf we wish to have a theistic discussion, let us discuss theology. Arguing that the bible is in some way a document of scientific merit, as you have several times previous mixes these issues.\n\n \n Let me get a theistic discussion started then, by stating that science, and the Bible, aren't on the same one dimensional realm as many theistic evolutionists seem to think they are. God is multidimensional - he has self existance, omnipresence, omniscience, omnipotence, perfection, infinity, incomprehensibility. Science, (the scientists who represent it) have none of those things. They have not the tiniest fraction of the ability to supersede what his word, the Bible says. That's what a Christian creationist believes, and an atheist doesn't believe it. What does a theistic evolutionist believe? Something in the middle? Something in the middle doesn't just cause the meaning of the Bible to be partly lost, it causes it to be compeltely lost, because Christianity isn't just about \"being good\", it's about the severity of a thing called sin, and the price paid for it's forgivness. \n \n \n \n \n \nCollin and electrolyte's tone aside, they do get their facts straight. When discussing details about evolution and the evidence that supports it, they hand out facts, even if they have little patience with people who don't read the evidence they provided. \n\n \n One dimensional, human facts. As I posted earlier, theistic evolution seems to be a 99 to 1 ratio. Why do theistic evolutionists seem so enthralled by science, and so disinterested in some BASICS of the New Testament?\n \n \n All that aside, to argue that they are immature cheapens the debate all around, if you feel they are acting petty, simply strive to rise above them and cary the discussion forward.\n\n \n And you think it is my fault, not theirs, that the debate is cheapened? \n \n \n \nI still don't see how this is true. If we suddenly discovered tomorrow that we were in fact more closely related to potatos than to apes, would this in any way shift what it is that makes us human? \n\n \n It has to do with that thing called sin. Atheism wants to destroy the concept of original sin, originating with the first man, Adam. Theistic evolution seems to be in agreement with this, and it goes back to what I said above - it undermines the basic way of reading and understanding the Bible.\n \n \n I believe that our moral beliefs originate with God, but am unconcerned with the process he used to infuse us with them. \n\n \n Are you unconcerned about the origins of sin, the severity of sin, the price paid for it's forgiveness?\n \n \n \nThere is a definite difference between a fight and a conflict. I've had fights with people over how much milk I could drink before I would throw up. There is no pressing conflict of ideology over the critical mass of milk a stomach can take. People can fight about petty things, but a true conflict is something significant. The real question is which one is this thread based around? \n\n \n This thread has gone off topic somewhat, but what you and I are discussing isn't petty, since it concerns false teachings, and leading people astray. The Bible speaks of Satan, the great deceiver. Do you think there is absolutely no chance that theistic evolution could possibly be one of his tools of deception? \n \n \n \nScience is not so arrogant to assume it can ever achieve certainty. \n\n \n That's a nice statement, but I don't see evidence of it. Certainty is proclaimed by science all the time, in theoretical matters. \n \n \n \nEvolution is not certain, just as atomic theory is not certain. Both, however, are backed up by a great wealth of experimental evidence that can not easily be overturned \n\n \n Again, it must constantly be pointed out that the word evolution has several meanings. In this case, does it mean \"change over time\", or does it mean, \"no Adam, no flood\"?\n \n \n \nTheism looks for certainty where it can be achieved, in philosophy of ethics and morality. In these areas, principles can be achieved without empricism. Archeology and history do not have this convienance. \n\n \n Atheists would probably tell you that they can look for it too, within themselves, and their lives experiences. (Christian) theists look for it in the Bible, and if their own feelings differ with an overall interpretation of the Bible, they realize the problem is with themselves, and not the Bible. \n \n \n \n \nThis statement is a blip, the odds of some archaeologist finding an artifact versus proclamations is moot. What matters is what has been found. \n\n \n How it's interpreted, and how it's reported. \n \n \n \nAnd what issues do you speak of that split Christianity and atheists? \n\n \n In the U.S., it's largely the same issues that split the Republican and Democratic partys. In a small government, it wouldn't matter much. Our government is no longer small, however. Seemingly small disagreements can involve big money, for either side.\n \n \n \n I can think of a few, but unless you addressed them individually we can't really discuss the reasons behind any given ratio. From a general point of view, I believe that the reason many theistic evolutionists side with the same side an atheist would side with, is such issues stem from instances where theists begin to intrude on issues of secular nature. \n\n \n Like when George Washington proclaimed the Thanksgiving day holiday? Why aren't theistic evolutionists concerned when atheists begin to intrude on U.S. traditions, like their beloved \"separation of church & state\"? \n \n \n \n \nYou really missed the point of my arguements here. Evolution does not deny the guiding hand of God, it simply observes his methods. When everything seems to play out naturally, it is because that is how God wishes it to work. In this way, science and religion are seperate yet compliment each other. I still cannot see why the two must conflict. \n\n \n In many ways they don't conflict. But in many ways they do - because atheists need evolution as a weapon, as I said above. \n \n \n \n \nThis is guilt by association. So there were some atheistic leaders in the world (though, as previously mentioned by those dirty atheists, not all of the ones you listed were atheists.) This misses my point that governments strive to be neutral but always fall short by some degree. I'll save some space by not listing all the heavily religious leaders known for their atrocities. \n\n \n The government that did the best job of not falling short just may have been the early U.S., before it separated church & state about 60 years ago. \n \n \nThis is a seperate issue. Leaders can be atheists, governments can be secular. Governments fail when religion is absent from the people. The USSR prohibited religious holidays, which ultimately undermined their people. To have a religious government is the same as having an atheist government, except the former would infringe on one religion fewer. A goverment need not be atheistic, it just must be free. \n\n \n It is a separate issue, but the U.S. government has grown by leaps and bounds in a striking relation to the time we decided to separate church & state. \n \n \n \nAgain you missed the point, but on this I am partly to blame as I did mention only muslim nations. The nations I listed were all ones where there is an official Religion. In Saudi Arabia you must be a Muslim to be a citizen. Notice I did not mention Turkey or Jordan. These are Islamic societies that do not enforce their religion and have much freer societies. Shall America become the newest nation where religion dominates government? \n\n \n It's not moving in that direction, despite what atheists say. \n \n \n \nYour point on Sodom and Gomorrah is interesting. Do you mean to say we need to 'fear' God in the sense that he'll bring down his wrath when we sin? In Sunday school, I was always told that fearing God meant something different in the old days and implied belief.\n \n\n \n It means different things to different denominations, but it largely means a recognition that we need a savior. If man decended from apes, if Adam didn't exist, if the entire Old Testament were fairy tales, do we really have all that much to fear? If the Old Testament is fairy tales, wouldn't we wonder if the New Testament was fairy tales too?\n \n \n On the point of 9/11, well I won't get too much into it suffice to say that 9/11 may shed some valuable light on Sodom and Gomorrah. Already, many people disagree as to what actually happened. Some say that America was responsible, some argue it was a Jewish conspiracy, some state it was Al-Quieda but disagree on who is to blame. The recent show Path to 9/11 is poignent in how it has begun to redefine what actually happened, as many scenes directly contradict the 9/11 report. Over time, the true story becomes fogged in mystery. \n\n \n Conflicts will always be going on in the world. While militant Muslims conflict with Americans, how Americans conflict with each other (Christians vs. Atheists) has a bearing on it. Political opinions in the U.S. are countless and endless, yet it just about always boils down to two positions - Democrat vs. Republican. In WW2, many different countries and ideologies were involved, but they separated themselves into two groups, Allied powers vs. Axis powers. The religious conflict in the U.S. today is mainly between Christians and Atheists. Which side is theistic evolution leaning towards? \n \n \n \n Imagine how Sodom and Gomorrah has changed since it was finally written down in the form we see it now. \n\n \n \"Finally written down\"? Don't theistic evolutionists recognize scripture's authority, origins, or preservation at all??\n \n \n \n to be brutally honest the observation of light is far more accurate and scientific, but biologists would disagree with me. We know more about the Andromedae galaxy than we do about our own minds, but given time, we learn more and more. \n \n Exactly, and it never will be. Any claim of an impeccable theory is laughed at, why do you think so many of the people on this board seem condescending? \n\n \n Because they laugh at the Bible as if it's on the same realm of scientific theories. \n \n \nLight from Andromeda can't tell us about Earth, but that wasn't the point. The point was to demonstrate that observations from millions of years ago are possible.\n \n \n No human is above arrogance and there are many examples of scientists who were extreme examples of arrogance. There are also countless examples of scientists clinging onto older notions. However, when push comes to shove, the majority of scientists will acknowledge new data and adjust their worldviews to it. No sufficient data has arrived to discount evolution, however. \n\n \n One dimentional stuff. \n \n \nNow this is a theistic question on which I would agree with you, God is necessary for existance. However, if you mean that life requires a glowing hand decending from the sky to mold it out of dirt, then you and I have a disagreement. \n\n \n So we disagree about the first man, and original sin? In that case, our two different attempts to discover who God actually is take off in different directions immediately. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI'm sure every professor has wondered about this. This actually is related to my sig, which you are so offended by. I'll bring it up again in a moment, when you mentioned it. \n \n \n There are some people who are a little crazy and would argue that the life of the three ring snail is more important than humans, but these are few and far between. I for one fully believe we are above animals in many ways. However, I don't see how environmentalism works here. The problem with our damage to the environment is not that the Earth will die. The Earth will always bounce back and adapt, we just might be left on the wayside during the adaptation. \n\n \n Here's how environmentalism works - if there is no God, either man or random processes can change the earths climate, cleanliness, etc. and therefore only man can take action to make it better - leaders, appointed, anointed men. No faith in God = more faith in men. No faith in God = bigger, more intrusive government. \n \n \n \n \nNow is a great time to get on about the quote in my sig that you have felt mocks God. First, I recommend you read the Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy as it is a funny book from which this quote originated. The quote is actually more about the arrogance of man than mocking God.\n \n The book discusses the Babel Fish described as such:\n The Babel Fish is small, yellow and leech-like, and probably the oddest thing in the Universe. It feeds on brainwave energy not from its carrier, but from those around it. It absorbs all unconscious mental frequencies from this brainwave energy to nourish itself with. It then excretes into the mind of its carrier a telepathic matrix formed by combining the conscious thought frequencies with nerve signals picked up from the speech centres of the brain which has supplied them. The practical upshot of all this is that if you stick a Babel fish in your ear you can instantly understand anything said to you in any form of language. The speech patterns you actually hear decode the brainwave matrix which has been fed into your mind by your Babel fish. \n \n The Babel fish, by effectively removing all barriers to communication between different races and cultures, has caused more and bloodier wars than anything else in the history of creation.\n \n The book then expounds that the supreme uncertainty of such a useful creature ever evolving naturally proved the non-existance of God. It is at this point my sig begins, listing the basic theory. \n\n \n That's all very nice, but how many people who read your sig are going to know that? At first glance, it appears to mock God, for instance when God says \"I hadn't thought of that\". First glances can portray a \"hollow and deceptive philosophy\". What atheist, (or false teacher) doesn't take delight in God \"not thinking\" of something? \n \n \nOn another level, I think it speaks leaps and bounds that you are so affected by the sig, which is all in good fun and I imagine that God has quite the sense of humor. If you can't laugh at your beliefs every once and a while, then I worry if you are all that confident in them\n\n \n Do you see the atheists here laughing at their beliefs?",
