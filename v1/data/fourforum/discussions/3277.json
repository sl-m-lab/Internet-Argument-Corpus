   "I see a sudden movement in the increase selling of 80% receivers so that you can circumvent the tax. How about anyone else? Just remember, taxation is no different from banning. Both prevent the user from obtaining the object, the former through his wallet rather than by law. Clear violation of the 2nd Amendment, just as you aren't being taxed to vote or practice religion. What if someone said we start taxing people who practice the Islamic faith to fund Homeland Security, is that fair?\n \n People who buy/own weapons make the police neccesary?
