A country striken with poverty.\n Bolivia, the third largest producer of cocaine. A substance we all know well. Either from use or just from knowledge.\n Bolivia is developing friendly ties with Fidel Castro, and Hugo Chavez, men we consider the outcasts. Men we consider trouble and unfriendly leaders.\n Morales, has called Bolivia a nightmare for America.\n But, he seems interested in ousting the drug trade. Now, personally I can't see Bolivia getting rid of Cocaine plants I beleive are called Cocu or some ####. It also serves as a tea down there.\n -John",

   "The plan by Morales is not to get rid of the Coca plant. His original support was from the Coca plant growers. But to get rid of the Cocaine trade in Bolivia. The Coca plant, it's leaves are important items specifically in the native population in Bolivia. Used for medicinal reason among other uses.\n \n Now for the use of Cocaine, do not blame the producer, or the trafiker, but the user. For without the user, their would be no trafiker, no producer.\n \n That and make it legal, control its distribution, and tax it for additional government revenues. It works for Alcohol, it would work for Cocaine.",
