   "While increased security definatly gives effective strikes a much higer political profiel, I think it more likely that it will drive the terrorists to attack less protected targets. This has its up sides and its down sides. While we can protect our airports, and to some extent our busses and subways, we cannot protect everything in America that could be a potential target.\n \n A terrorist group armed with a case of molotov cocktails could do several billion dollars worth of damage in a single night by torching factories. While they are probably considered a lesser target as far as their publicity value, it woud definatly make a point.\n \n I know of one industrial area in Kansas City, Mo where there are a couple of fertilizer factories, a chemical processing plant, several large warehouses and a petroleum holding facility all situated on the same mile of a single road. A half dozen guys with fire bombs could wipe out ALL of these in one night, most likely not be caught, and if done correctly could probably kill quite a few people. \n \n This kind of shows one of the cultureal differences between the Middle east and Americans. the terrorists believe that by killing civilians, pressure will be put on our government to back off in the middle east. Realistically, they could kill half the population of the US and our government would probably not see any significant pressure.\n \n If, on the other hand, they burned 2 DuPont factories, 2 GE factories, and a dozen Wal Marts to the ground, the pressure on our government would give a new meaning to the word.- This is kind of one of the problems with all your politicians being special interest whores.",

Concentrating security forces on specific, well-publicized potential targets will merely direct any dedicated terrorist with half a brain to more vulnerable but yet equally newsworthy targets. There's no way to protect it all. \n \n For New Year's Eve in Las Vegas, Homeland Security took over using National Guard troops and equipment (what's left of it) and the local police force. 275,000 people in one small area. They shut down the Interstate with armed roadblocks, closed access to the strip with armed roadblocks, restricted all airspace over the city, had armed choppers patrolling that airspace with random patrols of police and troops patrolling the streets. Everyone who lives here that I know, including a local police official, got a good laugh out of how the government could waste vast amounts of money on such ineffective BS. Any dedicated terrorist could have done just about whatever they wanted as long as he/she didn't use an airplane or drive a vehicle. As my cop acquaintance said, any self-respecting terrorist would have brought whatever weapons/explosives in and placed them long before the 'security' efforts were in place. \n \n I think Homeland Security is closing the barn door long after the horse left in an effort to show much of the mindless public that their government can spend $30 billion+ a year to 'protect' specific potential targets. They (terrorists) do pretty much what they want, when they want to do so, that being the best weapon they have against our conventional methods of defense and offense. As daewoo points out, the general public doesn't have a clue about our special interests (oil) formulating foreign policy that keeps us in bed with Israel, occupying Iraq and further uniting Islamic extremists who want us out of their world.",

News crews have been able to ship the components necessary to build nuclear weapons into high traffic ship yards and have them make it through inspection. Once they are past that point what is going to stop them? And how about our Southern border where we cannot stop the flow of illegals and we cannot stop the flow of drugs? If we can't stop either of those two things what makes you think we can stop al Queda members or chemical weapons that they wish to ship across? Our level of security is up in airports and that is about it. Beyond that we are vulnerable from multiple angles and ready to be striked at again. The only thing that I believe has kept the terrorists from going after us again is what we have shown our response to be. We lost two towers and they lost two countries. Our response has to have been a key deterrent in preventing another attack on us.

Now granted, 9/11 did not help, but in all reality, US AIR was due to go bankrupt anyway within a few years. It is the emergence of budget airlines such as Jet Blue, Air Tran, et... that have been hurting the majors. \n \n Why do you have to take off your shoes? Do you know who Richard Reed is? Also, many shoes have metal in the heels, which sets off the detectors. It is far easier to send them through x-ray, instead of having every other passenger alarm due to metal in their shoes, then having to search them all, and send the shoes back through the detector anyway. There are types of shoes that they will not make you take off, perhaps a little research before your next trip to the airport.\n \n Why can't you escort your wife to the gate? Well, security lines are long enough as it is, and with the enhanced screening, it takes longer per passenger. The last thing that people who fly often want to see is everyone allowed past the checkpoints, it clogs the system. And in all honesty, why do you feel the need to walk your wife to the gate? If you feel the need to see the pretty airplanes, there are observation areas at most major airports. Otherwise, at most airports, if you both want to have dinner or a drink before she goes, there are many airports with food and bars available outside the security points. And speaking from the point of view of someone who does fly a lot, the airports are crowded enough inside the checkpoints. \n \n And I think a little fear in the eyes of the public is healthy in a situation like this...don't you? People should be afraid, what happened and what is likely to happen again is a frightening thing. Perhaps a little fear will keep everyone alert, looking for things that do not seem right. Law enforcement cannot do it all for us, we must take some measure of responsibility by keeping our eyes open for problems. What rights have you given up? Being able to walk to the gate? ooooooooo. Not being able to walk through a metal detector with your shoes on? oooooooo. Not being able to carry a knife with you on the plane? ooooooo. What do you need a knife for on the plane anyway? I personally am glad to abide by these policies, since I know the reasons for them, and understand the benefits of security. I don't take off my shoes to assure that I am safe, I take off my shoes to assure that you are safe.

If so, I think that is a very selfish and shallow definition of freedom.\n\n \n If a politician goes bad, as they often do on a frequent basis, the FBI and other interested federal agencies, under the money laundering section of the Patriot Act, are allowed access to any and all financial records of any involved parties without a subpoena and the financial institutions are not allowed to notify their customers that those customers are involved in a federal investigation. What that means is that if I write a check to a political campaign, the politician goes bad and is investigated for political corruption, my check that was deposited into that campaign account will signal an investigation into my personal affairs. My bankers can't tell me about it, but you can bet it'll be a negative determining factor when I attempt to renew a revolving line of credit. That equals more cash and less accountability in political campaigns, especially at local levels.\n \n Many non-public development investment pools prior to the Patriot Act were formerly put together by a lead investor (or representative, usually a lawyer) who would 'take a reading' on the potential for subscription. Those were the pools that provided smaller and medium sized businesses (and some big ones) access to capital not available in conventional markets. The reading normally consisted of telephone calls or emails to an established group of individuals known for their willingness to invest in non-bankable situations. That's all gone now that telephone and email communications are collected on a mass basis and filtered for key words. Why? Because it violated the public notice act, that little ad in any newspaper stating that a private offering was available to interested parties, and any communication involving same prior to that ad (normally published after determination of adequate subscription being available) goes right to the SEC via the FBI and no one wants to be tagged with that. Affect? Diminished capital investment in our country at a time when we desperately need it.\n \n I've posted these, and many other economic limitations created by the Patriot Act, on other forums, realizing that they don't directly affect 98% of the population and that a majority of people would think 'Great, that'll keep the rich in line and keep them from getting richer'. If you want to consider who pays the bulk of taxes and makes the major financial decisions in our country, they do affect everyone. The next time you take your shoes off in an airport, remember that legislation enacted with emotional flag waving as the key factor seldom accomplishes anything other than getting the public in line to support political decisions and does have other ramifications.",

   "As increased security makes us a better target, any enemy being able to determine where our security resources are concentrated and avoid those efforts, it becomes easy for our government to whip the populace into accepting more and more limitations on our civil rights under the guise of 'protecting us'. While the Patriot Act, much of the text taken from always ready to go wartime legislation, was supposedly enacted to protect us from terrorism, the majority of applications have been under the money laundering section to pursue prosecution of organized drug/criminal activities and political corruption, the widely publicized numbers our justice department thrives on. In actuality, that means vast resources have been diverted from the primary intent of the Patriot Act, deterrence of terrorism, undermining all that very expensive increased security used to pacify the paranoid public after cranking them up to a feverish pitch to pursue foreign policy rapidly approaching disaster proportions in Iraq. There should be some logic involved in spending $30+ billion yearly for increased security, but I can't find it.",

Anyone who has ever been around a prison on the law enforcement side can tell you that shoes are one of the prime hiding spot for knives and shanks. Many shoes contain metal. Get it? Better to check, than to allow 5 terrorists to walk through with box cutters in their shoes and crash another plane into a building. And if you are not aware, Richard Reed did not have a knife in his shoes, he had a bomb...and almost got it lit. As a pilot, I would rather not find myself splattered all over the everglades because some XXXXX put a bomb in his shoes. I guess it really depends on your perspective, if you flew 3 or 4 different trips a day, 10-15 times a month, you might feel a little different about it too.",
