   "John M. Roll, the chief federal judge in Arizona, was fatally wounded in the attack near Tucson on Saturday that killed five others and wounded at least 18 people, including Representative Gabrielle Giffords. \n \n .... Judge Roll was appointed by the first President George Bush in 1991 and has been chief judge since 2006. His district is part of the sprawling Ninth Circuit, which covers federal courts throughout the West. He served as a state judge and as an assistant United States attorney for Arizona before he was appointed to the federal bench. \n \n .... In a statement, John G. Roberts Jr., the chief justice of the United States, said: \"We in the judiciary have suffered the terrible loss of one of our own. Judge John Roll was a wise jurist who selflessly served Arizona and the nation with great distinction.\"\n \n Former Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who lives in Arizona, said she was devastated by the news. \"It is a horrible event, and heartbreaking,\" she said. \"The judge was just wonderful.\"\n \n \"It sounds like something that might happen in some place like Afghanistan,\" she said. \"It shouldn't happen in Tucson, Ariz., or anyplace else in the United States.\"\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/09/us/09judge.html\n \n Another person targeted by second amendment rhetoric.",

   "Normally I try and have an introduce before rebuttal. But I can't think of a polite one to offer this time around. So I'm just going to get down to work and pick this one apart in my own way.\n \n \n\"There are now at least four federal legislative responses to the Tucson tragedy: McCarthy's bill; a bill from Rep. Bob Brady, D-Pa., to criminalize some violent imagery;\n\n \n Already wrong. Not violent imagery but rather something that can be \"perceived\" as threatening to a public official.\n \n Shooting prompts legislation to protect lawmakers, officials &#8211; CNN Political Ticker - CNN.com Blogs\n \n \"Rep. Robert Brady, D-Pennsylvania, said he will introduce legislation making it a federal crime for a person to use language or symbols that could be perceived as threatening or inciting violence against a Member of Congress or federal official.\"\n \n If such language isn't held under the strict scrutiny clause, which all laws relating to the First Amendment are bound by, the ramifications to be had could be quite serious in nature.\n \n \na bill from Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., to ban firearms within 1,000 yards of federal officials;\n\n \n Wrong again. It's 1,000 feet, not yards.\n \n King to introduce gun-restriction legislation in response to Tucson shooting Hot Air\n \n \"Rep. Peter King, a Republican from New York, will introduce legislation that will make it a federal crime to carry a firearm within 1,000 feet of federal officeholders and judges in response to the shooting in Tucson that killed Judge John Roll and gravely injured Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.\"\n \n Personally I don't see how this would do anything to make matters any better. Loughner committed both murder and assault with a deadly weapon, both of which are serious crimes. You and others aren't going to suggest that had it been illegal to be in such close proximity to Giffords while armed then he wouldn't have shot her, are you?\n \n \nand, paradoxically, a bill from Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert to allow members of Congress to carry their guns inside the Capitol. (It's legal in Texas!)....\n\n \n And what exactly is wrong with that? Congress makes laws that can affect the way our country is shaped and what course it takes in history. We're expected to trust them, sometimes even being told not to question them because it's offensive. Are you going to suggest that the lawmakers shouldn't be trusted to be armed for their own defense?\n \n \n\"By the end of Wednesday there was a USA Today/Gallup poll revealing that only 35 percent of Americans thought it was legitimate to blame conservatives for the tragedy, but only around 20 percent wanted more gun control.\"\n The shooting of Gabrielle Giffords leaves members of Congress at a loss in more ways than one. - By David Weigel - Slate Magazine\n\n \n Sounds pretty good for common sense if you ask me. Barely a third of the entire nation wants to blame conservatives for the actions of Loughner, and only a fifth think more gun control laws are an appropriate response to what happened Saturday. And while those numbers are still high, it shows that liberal poisoning and support is at an all time low.\n \n \n35 percent of Americans think it's legitimate to blame conservatives? That's still probably a much greater percentage than would blame the left despite the attempts of Jonesy and the World Nut Daily to turn the shooter into a flaming liberal.\n\n \n I've already cited the news release that Loughner had no political affiliation. Twice in fact. Do I need to cite it a third time, or is it just going to be ignored again because it doesn't fit the liberal political agenda?\n \n Regardless of what some might choose to claim, somebody trying to kill a liberal doesn't have to be a conservative.\n \n \nAnd how would expanding gun rights help? Even if the solution is to have more shootouts between the good guys and bad guys\n\n \n Do you have something against members of congress being legally able to protect themselves? Private security for each and every House and Senate member isn't a physical possibility, due to manpower shortages and budgetary constraints. Allowing congress members to protect themselves sounds both fair and reasonable to me. If they can be trusted to make the laws of this nation then they can be trusted to take care of their own security.\n \n Or is there some kind of double standard here? Maybe congressmen can't exercise proper discretion and might get tempted to shoot one another? If that's the case they shouldn't be allowed to hold public office in the first place. We don't want people making the law to control us if they can't even control themselves. That would be like letting child rapists have authority over daycare centers.\n \n \nit doesn't seem like Arizona can do much more to relax its gun laws. It's already legal for those 21 years or older to carry a concealed weapon without a permit in that state.\n\n \n The first point to make, there's little sense in bringing up Arizona's concealed carry statute, as if it somehow made any difference in the matter. This was a criminal action, subject to absolutely no legal protections. It doesn't matter if concealed carry was outlawed or restricted to the point a permit was needed, it wouldn't have made any difference.\n \n There's too many cases of criminals being in illegal possession of a weapon, to suggest that a concealed carry permit is somehow sought after by the scum of society.\n \n Now onto the rest of the criticism.\n \n I'm unaware of a single state that requires a full mental evaluation of prospective gun buyers. Do you know of any state having such laws?\n \n I've explained this issue at least once before. I really don't want to go into detail again, but I will since I feel it's necessary.\n \n There may have been warning signs to show that Loughner was dangerous, but nobody ever acted on those to try and prevent this. If the college thought he was a danger then why didn't they have him arrested or committed?\n \n There's been no report that Loughner was ever officially committed to a mental institution, found to be mentally ill and posed a danger to himself and others around him, or adjudicated as mentally deficient. One can only assume that since no report exists it never happened. That means there was nothing in the system to flag and thus no legal justification for denying him the purchase. One cannot legally deny a purchase for no reason without exposing themselves to lawsuits that could potentially bankrupt the business. It's a Catch-22 situation.\n \n Even if Loughner had been adjudicated, which carried legal weight and would flag him and be grounds for denial of a firearms purchase, such action wouldn't work unless his mental record was actually forward along to the NICS system as is dictated by law, which would be evidence of misconduct on the part of the state and local government, not any private individual or business owner.\n \n Even if Lougher was flagged and denied the purchase, there was absolutely nothing that would have prevented him from getting a friend to buy the gun for him and then give it to him at a later date, in what liberals like to call a straw purchase, and thus completely bypass the background check system and show that more stringent checks can be avoided by a two participant party. I've brought up this shortcoming in the liberal application and approach to gun control, but have received no response or recognition of the fact.\n \n It's appalling to claim that more gun control laws could have somehow prevented Loughner from carrying out his actions on Saturday. It's even more appalling to use the suffering of the dead and the survivors and their families, as grounds for furthering political agenda. It's nothing more than a tactic designed to use emotional suffering to shut down legitimate debate to try and shame opposition into quite compliance for fear of looking insensitive.",

You worry about whether or not Someone is exorcising their right to carry a gun or even to own a gun, when there are Far more things to worry over. I don't hear you talking about the millions of Poor and homeless in this country who should have a RIGHT to a meal . Don't hear you talking about the millions of crimes committed in this country using knives, ropes, bombs, cars, glass, poison, or anything else that can be used to harm another human being. No, all you want to do is abolish guns as if that is the key to your own personal salvation. \n \n AND YOU CALL ME A WHACKO??",
