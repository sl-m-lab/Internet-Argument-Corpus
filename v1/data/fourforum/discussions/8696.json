   "The latest mishap at the nuclear power plant in Forsmark puts problem of nuclear facilities safety in the focus once again. There are 20 or so such plants in Germany. That's a challenge I should say! \n In Forsmark it could have been really bad, a catastrophe of Hurrisburg or Chernobyl scale. They say this was short circuit which triggered the incident. Luckily the equipment we have at our nuclear plants makes it impossible such failures. \n Actually experts say technical malfunction is not the worst comparing human factor terrorism including. Where people's negligence or terrorism is involved it makes really difficult to guarantee anything...\n What I'm driving at is that terrorism is major threat to our nuclear safety as it is. Far as I know our security services prevented some nuclear plants penetration attempts by Islamic terrorists with European looks (Chechens or whoever else). There were diversions planned. I'm really scared to think of the possible consequences. I think we should keep all Muslims under severe control and better far away from any nuclear facilities and out of Germany too.\n Well it should be the case with all EU countries and USA imo.",
