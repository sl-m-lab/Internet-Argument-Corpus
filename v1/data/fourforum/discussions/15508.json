Sarsen stone is an [[Oligocene]]-[[Miocene]] silicified [[sandstone]], found as scattered blocks resting on the [[Chalk]] of southern [[England]]. In section it is sub-rectangular, with a minimum thickness of 8&nbsp;ft (2.4m), rising to a tapered top about 16&nbsp;ft (4.7m) high. [[Excavation (archaeology)|Excavation]] has shown that a further 4&nbsp;ft (1.2m) is buried in the ground.\n \n Heelstone is an eroded [[Column|pillar]] 254&nbsp;ft (77.4m) from the center of Stonehenge circle. It leans towards the Southwest (pictured view) nearly 27 degrees from the [[Vertical direction|vertical]]. The stone has an overall [[girth]] of 25&nbsp;ft (7.6m) and weighs about 35 tons. Some 12&nbsp;ft (3.7m) from its base is a narrow, roughly circular feature called [[Heelstone Ditch]], 4&nbsp;ft (1.2m) deep and 3.5&nbsp;ft (1.1m) wide. A large [[Scroll Trench|Arc Trench]] found in 1923 by [[William Hawley|Lt-Col William Hawley]] 9&nbsp;ft (2.7m) wide cuts this [[ditch]] from the West, deepening towards the stone.\n \n [[Mythology|Myths]] and legends of the [[Devil]] striking a \"Friar's Heel\" with a stone resulted in its eccentric name, ''Heel Stone''. Some claim \"Friar's Heel\" is a corruption of \"Freyja's He-ol\" or \"Freyja Sul\", from the [[Continental Germanic mythology|Nordic]] goddess [[Freyja]] and (allegedly) the [[Wales|Welsh]] words for \"way\" and \"Sunday\" respectively. It is doubtful whether any [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] standing stone has experienced as many name changes and interpretations. Only in the past three decades have world [[scientist]]s used the name Heelstone consistently.\n \n ==Source==\n * [[Richard J. C.

It is located in [[England]] at [[Stonehenge]] around its outermost [[sarsen]], the [[Heelstone]] (Stonehole 96). The [[ditch]] was cut into [[Late Cretaceous]] ([[Santonian]] Age) Seaford [[Chalk]], the formation which geologically crops out at Stonehenge. It is some 12 ft (3.7m) from Heelstone's base, having a diameter of roughly 32 ft (9.7m). A broad [[Arc (geometry)|arcing]] [[trench]] found in 1923 by [[William Hawley|Lt-Col William Hawley]] 9 ft (2.7m) wide cuts this ditch from the West, deepening towards the stone. Against the Heelstone Ditch (inside circle) is rammed chalk filled Stonehole 97, whose missing stone is known as Heelstone's twin. [[Stratigraphy|Stratigraphic]] sequence of these features, from earliest to latest, runs (southern) [[Avenue (archaeology)|Avenue]] Bank - Heelstone Ditch - Stonehole 97 - [[Scroll Trench]].\n \n [[Mississippian (geologic period)|Early Carboniferous]] ([[Arundian]] Age) High Tor [[Limestone]] [[Fossil|fossils]] identified from the lower-half fill of Heelstone Ditch include ''Aclisina, Aviculopecten, Bellerophon, Caninia cornucopiae, Chondrites, Cleiothyridina roissyi, Composita, Conocardium, Delepinea (Daviesiella) destinezi, Euphemites, Girvanella, Hapsiphyllum (Zaphrentis) konincki, Linoproductus, Megachonetes papilionaceous, Michelina grandis, Mourlonia, Murchisonia, Palaeosmilia, Plicochonetes, Rhipidomella michelini, Schellwienella'' cf. ''S. crenistria, Straparollus, Syringopora,'' and ''[[Zoophycos]]''. The upper-half fill is silted-in [[periglacial]] [[Cryoturbation|cryoturbated]] Seaford Chalk. Only a small part of Heelstone Ditch, immediately behind the [[Highways Agency]] A344 roadside fence, now remains unexplored or undisturbed. General nature of the ditch and fill described in 1979 by Michael W. Pitts, ''et al.'' [http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba.html], compares well with Hawley's (1923, 1925).\n \n ==Source==\n * [[Richard J. C.

Located within the (southern) [[Avenue (archaeology)|Avenue]], it begins as a shallow disturbance over Stonehole B (WA 3606) increasing in depth east-northeast as it [[Scrollwork|scrolls]]-arcs to the East deeper, its final depth being unknown. This broad feature cuts perpendicular through [[Heelstone Ditch]] whose segment is missing there in its curved path towards Stonehole 96 (WA 163), the [[Heelstone]]. It is exceedingly deep (6 ft, 1.8m) where it crosses just East passed the missing segment of Heelstone Ditch (average depth: 4 ft, 1.2m). Entirely cut away is Heelstone Ditch's lower-half fill of [[Mississippian (geologic period)|Early Carboniferous]] ([[Arundian]] Age) High Tor [[Limestone]] and its upper-half fill of silted-in [[periglacial]] [[Cryoturbation|cryoturbated]] chalk. Scroll Trench's backfill soil is a mixture of both [[Lithology|lithologies]] and stone chips of all Stonehenge period varieties, indicating it postdates their occurrences. Stratigraphic sequence runs Scroll Trench - Stonehole 97 - Heelstone Ditch - (southern) Avenue Bank, from most recent to earliest. [[William Hawley|Lt-Col William Hawley]] found Scroll Trench in his \"Excavations at Stonehenge during the season of 1923\";\n \n :''\"I did not follow the course of it up to the Helestone, as I should like to have done, for I avoided going nearer to it than 10 ft., fearing to disturb its stability (the depth being unknown)\" - \"A satisfactory examination would not be possible without permission and assistance from the [[Office of Works]].\"'' (page 25)\n \n Scroll Trench, eastward from Heelstone Ditch to the Heelstone, remains unexcavated to this day. The feature was dated by Office of Works' draughtsman Robert Newall as 7th-6th century BC, with an [[electrum]] [[stater]] coin. Hawley sought permission to fully examine it satisfactorily, and he sought assistance in stabilising Heelstone while investigating it, but neither were granted.<ref<Hawley, Lt-Col W.

There may be a trench that meets some of the description (ignoring the geology) but it does not appear to be significant and certainly not discussed in reliable sources under either name.

I know the creator of the article (see also their last edit just before mine) well from off-Wiki as an extremely prolific poster whose edits are (trying to be polite here) basically fantasies. This [User talk:Garry Denke - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia old version of his talk page] provides an example of his style.
