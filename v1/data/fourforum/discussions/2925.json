What do you think the beliefs of the world to be like, do you think would come up with a god again and in the same form? Would there be more atheists or new theories?\n\n \n I've been thinking about this a lot in the last couple of days, I could probably write a few pages, but I'm going to try and keep it real short.\n \n I think there was two MAIN functions in society that religion performed - \n \n 1- explanation of the \"unexplainable\"\n \n 2- the codification and enforcment of a moral and ethical standard of behaviour.\n \n I think there's a long list of other functions and purposes that religion served or was corrupted to serve as well, but I'll leave them out for now.\n \n Given that we have the knowledge and capability of modern science, we'd no longer need religion for #1. Much of the NT and most myths of Native American peoples and other similar myths which seek to explain nature would be completely unnecessary, and would likely not be contrived again. However, science can still not answer as fact how life and the universe came to be, therefore, I believe there would be those that would still attribute this to a higher power. Whether that power would take on the form of an intelligent, emotional, omnipotent \"human like\" being I don't know. IMHO, I doubt it.\n \n Secondly, I know that much of today's ethics and laws are rooted in Christianity, however, ASSUMING that our current morality and laws are retained, there would be no need for a religion to reinforce them IMHO. \n \n In essence, my feeling is that there would be very little or no \"organized\" religion. We wouldn't have the need to seek out explanation of the natural world or law and order through religion, so the organized, dogmatic approach to religion would be lost IMHO. However, humanity would likely seek to find a spiritual answer to questions like Where did life begin? What is the meaning of life? What happens when we die? etc...\n \n Like unkerpaulie, I think tradition is the only thing holding formal organized religion (and religion as a whole for that matter) together at this point, and IMHO, it's influence will continue to decrease as mankind continues to \"evolve\" and become more global in our understanding of others and our environment. \n \n Great thread Anastasia, I hope it keeps rolling.\n \n Waxy",

Something, or someone, must be causing it, but you can't see them, so it must be invisible spirits. As time progressed the more important spirits got elevated to God-hood.

   "If I can, I will throw this in for comparison: The Time Machine by HG Wells. The Eloi, the futuristic humans, were seemingly at peace, on the earth. No war, no marriage, no feelings of fear or sense of doubt; no religion. But when the Morlocks blew the horn, they all gathered together and made their way to the gate, which was the door of the underworld. Since these people had no concept of God, or religion of any kind, did that bring about peace? Or did the Morlocks become their god and the sound of the horn their religion?\n \n Of course that&#8217;s fiction.\n \n But, actually, what causes mankind to turn to rituals, beliefs, practices, or values when left to their own devices? From the outset, religion has been known to be dangerous, whether that conviction be good or bad. Knowing this and realizing that eventually mankind will turn to some form of it, how does it become justifiable, acceptable?

What do you think the beliefs of the world to be like, do you think would come up with a god again and in the same form? Would there be more atheists or new theories?\n\n \n After a short think on this, I believe we would eventually get to about the same state we're in now regarding religions. It might take longer because we'd already know a lot of the things that were puzzling to those ignorant people thousands of years ago who started with no knowledge at all. Fear of the unknown is likely a big part of what drove development of religions in the early stages. (It may drive some people today.)\n \n We'd certainly have leaders and people we respect a great deal, and look up to, and honor, and obey, and serve. There'd be some hierarchy and protocol to follow, maybe some bowing down. We'd still mourn the deaths of loved ones and great leaders. We'd wonder what happened to them after death. We'd want it to be a pleasant (heavenly) thing. We'd envision a heavenly place where we live again, but then forever. We'd think about who controls it and we'd come up with a supreme being...maybe not as one group of people coming to recognize one supreme being, but as multitudes of groups coming up each with its own version of a supreme being. Notwithstanding the fact that we wouldn't remember g-o-d as a word, we'd likely come up with a name.\n \n This question will produce entirely different answers between an atheist and a theist, even though we'd actually all become atheists when the hypothetical great memory dump happened. The atheists likely think man invented God because he was ignorant of science and would have had no need of religion had the scientific knowledge come first.\n \n The above is just my opinion.\n \n \n However, what I really KNOW as a matter of fact would happen is that God would thump our collective noggins and jog our memories. He will not be forgotten! I wouldn't know that immediately following the global memory loss, but my answer is based on what I know now.\n \n (By the way, a previous poster who wanted to start a thread like this but with the disappearance of books and stuff brought up a good point. If we lose our memories but not the jillions of existing copies of the bible and the jillions of existing religious films and pamphlets, we'd read our way back in a short while. The loss of memory should have been accompanied by the disappearance of all religious vestiges. Thinking that's what you meant, my answer stands.)",

It grants humans imagined immortality. The reason man developed a sense of greater existance relates back to the instictual behavior of survival. But what does religion have to do with behavior? Well, humans had figured out, for the most part, to survive in the real world. But, for some reason, humans died anyways. No matter what they did, no matter how healthy, the human would die regardless. If scientific knowledge did not dissapear along with religions, this would ever more be the case. Therefore, the logical path was to insure a type of survival after death. Thus the spiritual. It is much easier to say, \"when i die, i will still live spiritually\" than to say, \"no matter what i do, i will die\". Therefore religion.
