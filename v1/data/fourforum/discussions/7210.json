He [or, She] generally neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he [or she] is promoting it...He [or, She] intends only his [or her] own gain, and he [or she] is, in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was not part of his [or her] intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his [or her] own interest he [or she] frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he [or she] really intends to promote it.

He [or, She] will be more likely to prevail if he [or she]can interest their self-love in his [or her] favour, and show them that it is for their own advantage to do for him [or her] what he [or she] requires of them. Whoever offers to another a bargain of any kind, proposes to do this. Give me that which I want, and you shall have this which you want, is the meaning of every such offer; and it is in this manner that we obtain from one another the far greater part of those good offices which we stand in need of. It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest.
