   "I happened to be listening to local radio here in Detroit this AM and ran across an interview with Tammy Bruce, discussing her new book \"The New American Revolution\". \n Here's an excerpt from an interview with her so that you can get a flavor for her position.\n \n\n Who are the counterrevolutionaries about whom we should most be concerned?\n The counterrevolutionaries are those who have the greatest stake in society remaining as it has been for the past four decades. The average American has been told how to view the world by the few who control Mainstream Media. Left-wing leadership, the black, gay and feminist establishment leadership in this country has grown fat, rich and powerful through intimidation and threat. Career politicians believe they are owed their offices, running over and over and over again, never considering the fact that new ideas from a new generation are needed and invigorating. \n Entities like the ACLU, New York Times, and even the IRS, previously thought to be invulnerable, now feel the earth shaking beneath their feet. They're finding Americans are no longer afraid to say no, cancel subscriptions, organize against them, and even ask for their abolition. \n These entities and the people behind them have the most to fear and the most to lose. The establishment, leftist special interest groups, those who rely on the predictable status quo, should hang on tight. Their work is based in the presumption the average American knows nothing and can do nothing. They're now finding out how wrong they are.\n \n 3. You describe yourself as an \"openly gay, pro-choice, gun owning, pro-death penalty, voted-for-President Bush progressive feminist.\" Do you find it hard sometimes to find common ground with the conservatives who are\n inclined to reject about half of that?\n Interestingly, it was when I was on the Left, mired in leftwing leadership, where I saw the most racism, sexism, and homophobia. As I spoke with more and more conservatives through my career as a writer and radio talk show host, I found that even though they disagreed with many things I represent, there was a genuine curiosity, compassion and tolerance that has affected me greatly. I have been honored to experience the common ground of being an American First with conservatives and people of faith in our great nation. It is that respect, understanding, this love of country, freedom and liberty America represents which has made this nation the greatest on earth. This nation has been made strong and my life has been made better because of the values and passion of conservatives and people of faith. This special common thread, known only by Americans, does indeed transcend everything else. On the left the concepts \n http://tammybruce.com/archives/2005/11/the_new_america_1.php \n\n \n Now, the interesting thing is you would expect those positions coming from a \"Rightwinger\" right? But, the irony is that she's not. Here's a bit of her Bio:\n \n\n Biography\n Tammy Bruce is an openly gay, pro-choice, gun owning, pro-death penalty, voted-for-President Bush progressive feminist. She was drawn into feminist activism in the late 1980's to contribute to the ongoing effort to ensure safe and legal abortion for all women. Just two years after joining the National Organization for Women, and with a brand of feminism that places her somewhere between Donna Reed and Thelma and Louise, Ms. Bruce was elected president of the Los Angeles chapter of NOW at the age of 27. \n \n The youngest ever to achieve that position, she doubled the chapter's membership from 2,000 to 4,000 within a year with issue campaigns that introduced a fresh view of feminist activism. In her seven years as president (1990-1996, the longest continuous tenure in the chapter's 30 year history) she mobilized activists locally and nationally on a whole range of issues, including women's image in media, child care, health care, violence against women, economics, and domestic violence. Ms. Bruce also served two years as a member of the National NOW board of directors. \n http://tammybruce.com/biography.php \n\n \n What happened? My guess is that she saw the light and the vacuuous nature of liberalism in the US. It is their arrogance that she saw when people like George Soros attempted to buy the last election and the special interest groups that attempt to bully the public into accepting things that the average Joe finds objectionable. The \"real\" Silent Majority isn't remaining so. Her closing quote on her website is\" I contend September 11th was our tipping point, the day when Americans didn't necessarily wake up with new attitudes, we simply remembered who we are, and decided never to go asleep again. \"\n \n That just about sums up what's occurring in America. Americans are holding the media accountable for its biases and refusing to take journalists' words at face value. Critical thinking is the anti-thesis of liberalism, IMO. An informed public isn't a liberal public.",

I think it was Mark Shields that pointed that out in a column of his. You're right about pro-life being a litmus test among liberals. They actually look down on people who are pro-life.\n \n Tammy Bruce's message won't get out though, because the media will never give it decent publication. Not like they do when a conservative turns liberal.",

But, don't forget that he lost his bid to become the Democratic nominee for governor in 2002, probably because the liberal DNC base didn't want a Christian in the governor's mansion. So, you see, your example is a very weak one at best. But nice try. The spin was amusing. ;)\n \n\n OK, folks, what's the the next lie you want to spout?\n\n \n What a load.
