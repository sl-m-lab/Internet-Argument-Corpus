   "Something got me wondering... In the '94 Crime Bill, threaded muzzles were listed as a feature of an 'Assault Weapon' because it could be used to attach suppressors. My question is why are suppressors listed as an accessory to this 'evil' feature since they are legal (by federal law and most states) to own? Yes they are restricted, but they are also easy to obtain for someone who meets the requirements. Also, when was the last time a civilian registered machine gun (yes, pre-'86 mgs are legal as well) or suppressor was used in a crime, if ever?",

If police officers are civilians, it was 1996, when a chicago narcotics officer blew his top while questioning a suspect and put almost a whole clip inot the suspect. IF by \"civilian\" you exclude law enforcement officers, it has NEVER happened. Not one single time has a private citizen used a legally registered machine gun in the commission of a crime.",
