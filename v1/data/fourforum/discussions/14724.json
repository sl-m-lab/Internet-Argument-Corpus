The communication issues hinder the program's effectiveness in providing intelligence and infor-\n mation to be shared among the agencies, the report contends.\n ATF Deputy Director Kenneth Melson responded to the review in a letter to the justice department expressing concerns over how his agency was evaluated in the review.\n Melson agreed with the Justice Department's recommendation for ATF to increase communication efforts with other agencies - including the Mexican government.\n \"ATF has been and will continue to evaluate and refine protocols for sharing strategic intelligence with the Government of Mexico and our domestic partners,\" he said in the letter.\n However, Melson also asked the Justice Department to keep in mind that combating violence, gun trafficking and drug trafficking is a challenging border initiative that takes time, understanding and money.\n \"There have been significant challenges given the differences between the Mexican and United States legal systems, the investigative capabilities and resources, and the culture and laws relating to firearms possession,\" he said.\n Mexican gun tracing was also a point of weakness outlined in the Justice Department's analysis. Melson agreed that tracing efforts have not been fruitful in Mexico, but he assured the DOJ that giving Mexican officials 64 computers, with the translated version of the U.S. tracing database, would help improve the effort.\n The report indicates the program's successes as well as as well as its shortcomings. Advantages to the program include the fact that the number of traces of U.S. and Mexican crime-involved guns has increased since the program's launch and there has been a 54 percent increase in the number of gun smuggling cases referred for prosecution in the United States.\n Overall, the ATF agreed with most of the review.\n \"We are committed to building on these successes and improving the program in the areas identified by the (Office of the Inspector General),\" Melson wrote.? \n\n \n I suppose they are hard to trace when they are coming across Mexico's southern border or by sea from foreign countries or by our own government largess in selling Mexico the real thing? How come Mexico got the guns as well as the smugglers and trying to \"refer the prosecutions to the U.S.\" Smells like a litter box to me.\n \n Of course none of the ATF want to deal with the Mexican crime syndicates; no one wants to lose their head over something so trivial...then is is much safer and easier to accuse an American citizen of something they did not D.O.L\n \n Now there is a new director of atf who is certain to try to infringe on American law and citizens...bad choice and certain to be deep sixed in the hearings as we eagerly await January 3rd.",
