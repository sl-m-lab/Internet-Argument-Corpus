A person on the Today show commented on how it could have been a good political move for just ONE of them to show up to make the others look bad but none did...because they don't care?\n \n What do others think of this? It seems that many are very upset and think this will hurt the republican party when it comes to minority votes...",

   "Oh please, that is convenient. A few people laughed at the host making a jab at some \"too important\" candidates who were no-shows and that makes it justifiable? The other candidates showed...they didn't seem to be \"afraid\" of the minorities. What a pathetic excuse....it only goes to show that they probably don't give a ####. They'll show up at one or two minority events in their campaign and that is it. Besides, even if the minority audience were biased and oh my goodness maybe they would pose HARD questions to these candidates about THEIR future, oh no! poo' little scared republicans afraid of the minorities. All campaigns turn into a media circus, it is the job of a presidential candidate to meet and greet with the people who are going to put them into power, no excuse.",

When the economy was overheating and interest spikes didn't do the job, taxation slowed it down to reasonable, sustainable levels. We're not experiencing that now.",
