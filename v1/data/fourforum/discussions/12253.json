   "Support for the LGBT Community\n \n \"While we have come a long way since the Stonewall riots in 1969, we still have a lot of work to do. Too often, the issue of LGBT rights is exploited by those seeking to divide us. But at its core, this issue is about who we are as Americans. It's about whether this nation is going to live up to its founding promise of equality by treating all its citizens with dignity and respect.\"\n \n -- Barack Obama, June 1, 2007\n [*]* Expand Hate Crimes Statutes: In 2004, crimes against LGBT Americans constituted the third-highest category of hate crime reported and made up more than 15 percent of such crimes. President Obama cosponsored legislation that would expand federal jurisdiction to include violent hate crimes perpetrated because of race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, or physical disability. As a state senator, President Obama passed tough legislation that made hate crimes and conspiracy to commit them against the law.[*] * Fight Workplace Discrimination: President Obama supports the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, and believes that our anti-discrimination employment laws should be expanded to include sexual orientation and gender identity. While an increasing number of employers have extended benefits to their employees' domestic partners, discrimination based on sexual orientation in the workplace occurs with no federal legal remedy. The President also sponsored legislation in the Illinois State Senate that would ban employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.[*] * Support Full Civil Unions and Federal Rights for LGBT Couples: President Obama supports full civil unions that give same-sex couples legal rights and privileges equal to those of married couples. Obama also believes we need to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act and enact legislation that would ensure that the 1,100+ federal legal rights and benefits currently provided on the basis of marital status are extended to same-sex couples in civil unions and other legally-recognized unions. These rights and benefits include the right to assist a loved one in times of emergency, the right to equal health insurance and other employment benefits, and property rights.[*] * Oppose a Constitutional Ban on Same-Sex Marriage: President Obama voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment in 2006 which would have defined marriage as between a man and a woman and prevented judicial extension of marriage-like rights to same-sex or other unmarried couples.[*] * Repeal Don't Ask-Don't Tell: President Obama agrees with former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff John Shalikashvili and other military experts that we need to repeal the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. The key test for military service should be patriotism, a sense of duty, and a willingness to serve. Discrimination should be prohibited. The U.S. government has spent millions of dollars replacing troops kicked out of the military because of their sexual orientation. Additionally, more than 300 language experts have been fired under this policy, including more than 50 who are fluent in Arabic. The President will work with military leaders to repeal the current policy and ensure it helps accomplish our national defense goals.[*] * Expand Adoption Rights: President Obama believes that we must ensure adoption rights for all couples and individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation. He thinks that a child will benefit from a healthy and loving home, whether the parents are gay or not.[*] * Promote AIDS Prevention: In the first year of his presidency, President Obama will develop and begin to implement a comprehensive national HIV/AIDS strategy that includes all federal agencies. The strategy will be designed to reduce HIV infections, increase access to care and reduce HIV-related health disparities. The President will support common sense approaches including age-appropriate sex education that includes information about contraception, combating infection within our prison population through education and contraception, and distributing contraceptives through our public health system. The President also supports lifting the federal ban on needle exchange, which could dramatically reduce rates of infection among drug users. President Obama has also been willing to confront the stigma -- too often tied to homophobia -- that continues to surround HIV/AIDS.[*] * Empower Women to Prevent HIV/AIDS: In the United States, the percentage of women diagnosed with AIDS has quadrupled over the last 20 years. Today, women account for more than one quarter of all new HIV/AIDS diagnoses. President Obama introduced the Microbicide Development Act, which will accelerate the development of products that empower women in the battle against AIDS. Microbicides are a class of products currently under development that women apply topically to prevent transmission of HIV and other infections.Civil Rights\n :thumbsup\n \n Some of these have already been attempted, but blocked by a Bush veto that rejected the wishes of the majority.\n And to some extent, I think Bush thumbing his nose at the majority played a part in the last election.",

In a recent poll, published in Military Times, the majority of servicemen and women didn't want this repealed. This was the major hurdle that stopped President Clinton when he tried to allow gays to serve openly.\n\n Why does that matter?\n Congress and the president legislate the law.\n \n If a majority of men and women didn't like the speed limit, does that mean we should eliminate that as well?\n \n And by your approach, would blacks have ever been integrated in the military? Should we have to wait until the \"serviceman\" decide they want to do their jobs a certain way before they do it that way? The military is not a democracy.\n Furthermore, it's the taxpayers who provide the salaries, so they should have a say on the policy too...\n \n Regarding the poll you mention, it's not representative. Polls, to be a true representation, require a random selection.\n The \"Military Times\" poll consisted solely of Military Times readers. At best, the poll could be indicative of the readers views, but should not be extrapolated onto the whole military.\n \n Finally, the Palm Center research memo shows that opinion in the military is actually far more favorable toward gay service than the Military Times poll suggests. In the 1990's, the percentage of men in the Army who \"strongly oppose\" gays serving in uniform dropped nearly in half, from 67% to 37%. In 2004, an Annenberg poll found that among junior enlisted personnel, a slight majority favored openly gay service. In 2006, a Zogby poll of Iraq and Afghanistan vets found that 72% were \"personally comfortable\" around gays.\n \"The real news here is the opposite of what Donnelly claims,\" said Dr. Nathaniel Frank, senior research fellow at the Palm Center and author of Unfriendly Fire: How the Gay Ban Undermines the Military and Weakens America. \"While the media has reported it as news that the military opposes gay service, the trend is toward much greater tolerance: the 58% figure, which would actually be closer to 50% in a randomized poll, is a big drop from the 74% who opposed gay service in 1993, when the current policy was created.\" Frank pointed out that one poll that year found that fully 97% of generals and admirals opposed lifting the ban. Today, over one hundred retired flag officers have signed a statement calling for repeal.\n \n Frank also pointed to data showing that the military is far more open to gay service than it was before. Among the 20% of Zogby respondents who said they were not comfortable around gays, only 5% said they were \"very uncomfortable.\" The vast majority simply don't care. In addition, a majority said they knew or suspected someone in their unit was gay. \"That means gays already serve openly throughout the U.S. military,\" said Frank, \"and we have no problems attributed to this; the force has hardly been destroyed.\" He added that it was \"hopelessly na\u00efve\" to conflate an opinion poll with an indication of what will actually happen when the ban is lifted.\n Military Times Poll Flawed - Yahoo!

WHO is the \"commander in chief\" here?\n If the privates don't like serving along-side the black folk, do they just up and tell the general that they don't like it? emoticon_frazzled\n \n Let me educate you ...\n Clinton's REAL problem was the Republican congress at the time.\n See, Clinton's problem was that the LAW stated something about gay military service. Clinton couldn't just say \"there is no law\" or \"the law is gone\".\n Congress had to be a part of the effort, just like Congress had to be a part of Clinton's health insurance efforts or Bush's retirement efforts.\n And like the other two, Congress bucked Clinton and instead of working with him they actually passed a veto-proof law that re-affirmed \"gays cannot serve in the military\".\n \n Clinton did the only thing he could do. \"Signed\" it rather than have his veto overturned and be embarrassed, and then he used his Commander-in-Chief power to tell the military the IMPORTANCE (or lack thereof) of that anti-gay military service law. Instead of \"asking\" when they signed for enlistment, you don't do that anymore. Not doing it anymore than they ask if the person has engaged in sodomy with the opposite sex, or engaged in adultery, or any number of other things that are illegal under the UCMJ.\n It was called a \"compromise\", but that was really just political spin.\n \n Clinton couldn't buck Congress's law, and Congress couldn't tell Clinton how have the military enforce it.\n \n And as for the military's opposition???\n Yeah. I know. You don't want to believe me...\n But do yourself a favor and look back at history. This isn't the first time that the military was told to do something they didn't want to do.\n Remember blacks in the military from your history books? Or at least do yourself a favor and research the issue...\n Sorry, but the military being \"opposed\" doesn't mean much.\n It's a \"take orders\" environment. Men trained to \"follow orders\".\n Remember?\n \n \n \nIt has been a dozen or so years since President Clinton tried it, but I don't think things have changed enough to remove that resistance.\n\n Well, considering where the REAL opposition lay...\n If you think a Democrat congress is going to buck the gay military thing and not have a serious upheaval within the party?\n \n \n \nAs for the polls, your right there are polls that counter the one I quoted.\n\n No.\n The point is that your poll WAS NOT REPRESENTATIVE of the MILITARY.\n It may have been representative of the Military TIMES readers, but not the military.\n \n If you have been following the \"gay military\" issue, you'd have noticed a LOT of really funky stuff going on.\n People who are OUTED as gay, and then they STAY in the military.\n There's one guy who was outed, kicked out, then RECALLED to military service.\n \n One thing that demonstrates how ridiculously messed up the opposition to gay military service is is how the current war times shows a DECLINE in gays getting kicked out.\n The truth is that when the military needs members, they KEEP gay service members.\n It's one of the proofs that the \"military opposition\" is based on nothing more than prejudice. Not to mention a few government research studies that also drive home that point.\n Why should we, the tax-payers who have a vast majority disapproving of the gay exclusion policy in the military, cater to military prejudice against gays?\n \n \n \nI referenced this one because it seemed to align with what President Clinton experienced.\n\n Clinton did his thing well over 15 years ago.\n You seriously underestimate how much the military has changed on the issue, and how that change has taken place.\n \n On gay issues, there is a huge age gap. The youth have majority support for EVERY FACET of gay equal rights.\n The oldest generation is the one that is the most opposed.\n And in the military, how does that affect the \"military brass\"?\n Of course they are going to complain and whine and try to cater to their pointless prejudice.\n But the troops in general are MUCH MORE ACCEPTING of gays than they would care to admit, or possibly even realize if they indulge themselves in \"assuming\" whatever is convenient for their prejudice...",

   "Regarding the poll you mention, it's not representative. Polls, to be a true representation, require a random selection.\n The \"Military Times\" poll consisted solely of Military Times readers.

It's like saying an LA Times poll doesn't really prove anything because only LA Times readers participated, rather than everyone in the country, over an issue that wouldn't likely change or be different in the LA area as opposed to everywhere else. How exactly is ANY publication going to poll very easily outside of it's reader base? By that standard, most any poll by any publication EVER is invalid.\n \n \n[color=&quot;blue&quot;][indent]Finally, the Palm Center research memo shows that opinion in the military is actually far more favorable toward gay service than the Military Times poll suggests. In the 1990's, the percentage of men in the Army who \"strongly oppose\" gays serving in uniform dropped nearly in half, from 67% to 37%. In 2004, an Annenberg poll found that among junior enlisted personnel, a slight majority favored openly gay service. In 2006, a Zogby poll of Iraq and Afghanistan vets found that 72% were \"personally comfortable\" around gays.\n\n \n Frankly, this is a good example of the sort of dishonest representation of polling data that makes statistics sometimes so unreliable.

Trying to attack the poster rather than the issues. The real question is why you would even want to spend so much time DOING something like that, to the point of dedicating a thread to it. No one else puts so much into doing that than you. Did you hear that? No one else has that problem, Foundit. Only you. Everyone else just wants to debate the issues. But that's not going to sink in, is it? History has shown you're not going to get it, and will just take a deflective approach to any need for self-reflection--always someone else; never you.\n \n Just DEBATE, Foundit. Debate!

I however am sure enough of my position at this time to back it with action.\n\n You keep failing to recognize a fundamental truth of the situation, amongst the other aspects.\n For two people to \"bet\", they must have a mutual desire for something that they can gain.\n You offer me nothing that I want.\n I don't care if you leave this board.\n I don't care if you change your avatar.\n You're just side-tracking the issue...\n \n \n \nOn this I agree completely.\n\n Since you agree that the knowledge will occur regardless, there is obviously another purpose behind your desire to \"bet\" me...\n As I have previously postulated, I believe it is in part to obfuscate this discussion.\n Since you brought that up, you have completely failed to really discuss the topic, or intelligibly address the points I have raised...\n \n \n \nThey don't have any power, directly. I never said they did. However, indirectly they have a great deal of influence. Many Senators and House members put a great deal of value on the opinions of military brass when it comes to military policy. And rightly so in my opinion. \n\n Except their \"opinion\" is based on prejudice, and there are a couple studies out there documenting that gays CAN serve openly in the military with minimal problem.\n You've got OTHER COUNTRIES which have open gay military service.\n You've got the polls I showed earlier which showed a LARGE percentage who believe they are ALREADY SERVING with a gay person.\n \n The claims of the \"military brass\" are based on prejudice.\n If we allowed that mentality to rule, the restrictions on black military service would have lasted a LOT longer than they actually did...\n \n \n \nFrom the public: Maybe. I only say maybe because of the way voting has gone lately. The polls saw prop. 8 failing in California, but he may indeed have the support on this one.\n\n Prop 8 has nothing to do with gay military service.\n Since you don't know, you should educate yourself, unless you're afraid of what you may find...\n \n Ignorance is a lame excuse.\n \n \n \nFrom Congress: I don't think he does. Hard to tell for sure but I just don't think the landscape has changed that much. I also don't think a poll will tell the truth either afterall we are talking about politicians, we'll just have to see if they have a vote.\n\n Congress has unfortunately not seen any poll on the issue to gauge the temperature.\n The democrat platform for 2008 explicitly stated gay military service as an item to fight for gays on.\n Dem platform called 'strongest ever' on gay rights - Washington Blade\n \n The Republican presidential nominees were unilaterally against it.\n There is a lot unknown on this...\n \n \n \nFrom Generals: It certainly would help since many members of congress are prone to listening to them.\n\n Yeah.\n Cause we all know what an outstanding job they did in Iraq and how accurate they were on that...\n < end sarcasm <\n \n \n \nI've backed them with plenty of debate, however I am ALSO willing to back them with action. You however are not willing to take that step, to be honest I'm not suprised.\n\n You're starting to discuss the subject once again, but to claim that you have \"backed\" this discussion with debate is an absurdly false claim.\n I decimated your position in an earlier post, and then you responded with JUST that \"bet\" challenge.\n It doesn't take any brains to bet...",
