   "Speaking of his decision to not run for reelection, DeLay said \"I refuse to allow liberal Democrats an opportunity to steal this seat with a negative personal campaign,\"\n \n What world does he live in? He's been indicted for fraud, and his aids are turning state's evidence. Pointing this out is running a \"negative personal campaign\"? Removing a criminal from office is \"stealing\"? I wonder what the order of events was. Did being a chronic liar lead to his unethical behavior, or did his lack of ethics require him to lie so much that it's simply habit now? Either way, good riddance. Maybe someone with a better grasp of reality will be able to follow the law, instead of pretending it doesn't apply to them.",

   "No. Political period. Unless you think there's a difference in Democrats and Republicans...\n\n \n Of late? Yes, there is. The Republicans have a much more finely tuned media machine, so when the Republicans decide that X is their position on issue Y then everyone in Washington gets their memo with the talking points, the radio stations get their sounds bites and buzzwords, and the websites get their slogans and quotes. This means that if a Democrat is lying, they're generally lying on their own. If you catch a Republican lying, take a look around and you'll most likely find a whole bunch of other Republicans telling the same lie, with the same catch phrase. Think \"Clean skies inititive\", \"tax relief\", \"saddam was connected to 9/11\". Everyone knows that if you repeat a lie often enough people will believe it. The Republicans have developed the network to efficiently put that to use. The Democrats are strictly amateur in comparison.\n \n Edit: I'll admit that the Republicans haven't been doing so much of this lately, say in the last 6 months. Trust in the government is at an all time low, so lies are harder to pass off as truth. If you look at them a year or two ago, however, you almost can't help but be impressed with the efficiency and organization with which they diseminated lies.",

   "On Hardball tonight I seem to remember Tom Delay saying something like, \"Americans will vote Republican because they are the party that get things done and they do what they say they'll do\". This of course leads me to reminiscing back over the last 6 years since they took control of the Oval Office and Congress to ask. \"What exactly have they gotten done?\" I remember campaign issues like tax reform, tort reform, social security reform, cutting the deficit, and making America safer from terrorism. It's obvious they've done nothing with respect to the first four issues, and it's debatable whether they've accomplished the last. They have demonstrated, however, that they're better at spending money than any other administration that has preceded them. I'm not quite sure what Tom was bragging about, and considering every poll I've seen, apparently most Americans aren't either.",
