Pro-abortion, in any reasonable understanding of the english language, would mean an advocacy for abortion itself - i.e. trying force women in certain situations to get an abortion. This is similar to being pro-death penalty, which would be support of the death penalty - i.e. trying to have the death penalty imposed by force in various situations. No choice is implied in the term pro-abortion, just as no choice is implied in the term pro-death penalty. \n \n I do indeed use the term pro-choice because that is what is supported - i.e. the woman's CHOICE. Nobody on the pro-choice side, as far as I know, has ever advocated that any woman SHOULD get an abortion if it is not her choice. If you claim that, then support that with quotes. \n \n The bottom line is that terms in english carry certain meanings.
