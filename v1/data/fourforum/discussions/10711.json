Events happen on such a grand scale that it is hard not to feel a little insignificant in comparison. In reality, one of the most remarkable features of our Solar System is the near-constant stability of factors such as temperature, which have nurtured the development of life on Earth. A difference of few degrees was sufficient to turn Venus into a suffocating inferno, and yet Earth has retained the delicate balance required for millions of years.\n \n \n While no single factor is responsible for the regulation, plants have an important role to play in the recycling of oxygen. If no plants existed on Earth the humans and animals would use up all the oxygen in less than 300 years. The future of the Earth's ecosystem is by no means assured. The use of phrases such as the greenhouse effect and global warming are now commonplace; in a geological blink of an eye we threaten to destroy the very balance that we depend on for life.\n \n Water is a very unusual material, with lots of perculiar properties, and many scientists have now concluded that it is an essential component for the development of life. The search for life in our solar system has now turned into the search for water. Where ever water existed in a liquid form, life may have developed and thrived. The most likely candidate at present is Europa, one of Jupiter's icey moons. It is thought that geological activity could result in a warm water ocean beneath its frozen surface. The rarity of liquid water is another indication of how lucky we are here on Earth. Our tiny planet contains so much water that if the Earth was a perfectly smooth sphere it would be covered by a single ocean 2.8 kilometres deep.\n \n \n One of our planets less obvious features is its magnetic field. Charged particles from the Sun, called the Solar Wind, pass the Earth at speeds of around a million miles per hour. As they slam into the magnetic field, a protective cocoon is created that surrounds the Earth. When the Solar Wind is particularly strong, some of the particles slip through and collide with the Earth's atmosphere, creating the spectacular aurora around the north and south poles.",

   "For the record, as I'm sure all of you can tell from their posts, both \"Archangel\" and \"eanassir\" are creationists. They do not represent my views or those of the mainstream Intelligent Design movement.\n \n \nBecause of the history of it.\n\n You're going to have to be more specific. The history of Intelligent Design seems almost entirely legitimate to me. The movement started back in the mid through late 1980s with the publication of several books taking a skeptical view of evolution, none of which where creationist. Phillip Johnson, who was a creationist, brought together thinkers from many view points before and after the publication of his book, Darwin on Trial. including what had traditionally been labeled as young earth creationists, old earth creationists, and agnostics. Since then, the movement has grown to encompass Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, New Age theorists, Platonists, and, yes, even atheists. William Dembski made the basic components of the theory intellectually complete with his concept of specified complexity in 1998. \n \n It is true that some members of the young earth creationist movement have tried to use ID to promote their view of Christianity, but this is hardly a problem with the ID movement itself. Dawkins has done much the same thing with evolution by using it to promote his version of atheism, but that hardly makes evolution the same thing as atheism. The point is that both theories are based on scientific evidence that should be judged on its own merits.\n \n \nWell, ID is actually identical to 'scientific creationism', but spruced up with more scientific terminology to attempt to pass \n 'seperation of church and state'. Let's just say that I.D. is an attempt to teach Creationism in school.\n\n Well, if that is your perspective, yes, I can see why you would think they are the same idea. However, the differences between the two theories are much, much more fundamental than just the wording.\n \n Perhaps the most obvious difference is that creationism is a committed structure of theological beliefs, while ID is based entirely on scientific evidence. Although it is true that ID has theological implications, the same could be said of evolution, the big bang, and, for that matter, any theory regarding the origin of biology and the universe. Creationism, on the other hand, is an entirely theological idea that attempts to find support in the realm of science.\n \n Because it is theologically based, each of the following beliefs are necessarily a part of being a traditional creationist:\n \n 1. Apes and humans did not share a common ancestor.\n 2. The earth is about six thousand years old.\n 3. Life on earth did not have a common ancestor.\n 4. Changes within existing life occur only within fixed limits.\n 5. Belief in catastrophism, usually involving a global flood as the primary explanation.\n 6. There was a sudden creation of the universe, life, and energy from nothing.\n \n None of the above beliefs are part of ID theory. Because ID is derived and proven using scientific evidence, it is a much more unassuming theory. ID proposes the following:\n \n 1. Irreducible and specified complexity are reliable indicators of design. \n 2. Systems in biology exhibit irreducible and specified complexity. \n 3. Natural and/or undirected explanations are inadequate when it comes to irreducible and specified complexity. \n 4. As a result of the above three points, Intelligent Design is the best explanation for the origin of these kinds of complexity in biological systems.\n \n \nIf we're being honest, ID is nothing but Creationism with the word \"God\" removed to try to avoid legal \"seperation of church and state\" issues. I've never heard from a single ID'er who didn't think the designer was God. But you can't teach \"God created man\" in a public science class, so ID was born in an attempt to get around that.\n\n If ID advocates avoid using the G-word, it has nothing to do with public education or separation of church and state. Design theoretic reasoning doesn't give us cause to bring up God. The evidence that ID is based on points only to a designer and gives us no details about the nature of that designer.\n \n \n \nThis ruse hasn't fooled many, however, as the Dover case has proven.\n\n \n And, of course, there is the view of Judge Jones of the Dover, PA trial who stated in his decision, \"The evidence at trial demonstrates that ID is nothing less than the progeny of creationism\" and \"The overwhelming evidence at trial established that ID is a religious view, a mere re-labeling of creationism, and not a scientific theory.\"\n\n Having read a large amount of the trial documents and cross-examinations, I am unconvinced. Feel free to bring up any arguments from the Dover trial about ID in a new thread - I have yet to find anything new.\n \n Jones especially makes me doubtful about the way many advocates of evolution promote the trial. A total of 5,458 of the 6,004 words in Judge Jone's ruling about Intelligent Design as science came directly from a document submitted to him by the ACLU. Although this is an acceptable practice in the legal community, it leaves the question of whether or not Jones actually understood what was happening completely open. \n \n Adding to this possibility is the fact that Jones copied many out of context quotations and even complete misrepresentations of ID advocates from the ACLU. For example:\n \n Judge Jones wrote:\n \"He [Behe] was presented with fifty-eight peer-reviewed publications, nine books, and several immunology textbook chapters about the evolution of the immune system; however, he simply insisted that this was still not sufficient evidence of evolution, and that it was not good enough.\"\n \n The ACLU wrote:\n \"He [Behe] was confronted with the fifty-eight peer-reviewed publications, nine books and several immunology text-book chapters about the evolution of the immune system, P256, 280, 281, 283, 747, 748, 755 and 743, and he insisted that this was still not sufficient evidence of evolution - it was \"not good enough.\"\n \n Behe actually said:\n \"These articles are excellent articles I assume. However, they do not address the question that I am posing. So it's not that they aren't good enough. It's simply that they are addressed to a different subject\" (emphasis added)\n \n The discovery institute did a study on this that can be found here.\n \n Finally, the wishes of the intelligent design movement were not being respected at Dover. The Discovery Institute repeatedly made it clear, both in public and private, that they were not proposing teaching or referencing Intelligent Design in schools. Intelligent Design is an ongoing research program that is not ready for public education yet. While we have a lot of evidence pointing to the idea that an unknown something out there played around with an unknown number of design indicators, we still need to find a lot of details. (although, to be fair, Behe's new book about The Edge of Evolution is a huge step in the right direction) Instead of teaching ID, the Discovery Institute recommended taking a more balanced approach to evolution.\n \n \nThen be troubled because ID is clearly creationism. For example, an early draft of \"Pandas and People\" stated:\n \n \"Creation is the theory that various forms of life began abruptly, with their distinctive features already intact: Fish with fins and scales, birds with feathers and wings, mammals with fur and mammary glands.\"\n \n After attempts by \"creation science\" to get religion taught as science failed in the courts, the text was altered. The published text reads:\n \n \"Intelligent design means that various forms of life began abruptly through an intelligent agency, with their distinctive features already intact: Fish with fins and scales, birds with feathers, beaks and wings, mammals with fur and mammary glands.\"\n\n \n However, as is stated in the Discovery Institute's private Wedge document, one of the goals of ID creationism is: \"To replace materialistic explanations with the theistic understanding that nature and hurnan [sic] beings are created by God.\" That sounds like creationism to me.\n\n \n As I mentioned earlier in this post, I agree that some have attempted to use ID to support their specific religious ideas. Again, this doesn't make ID identical to those religious ideas any more than Richard Dawkins using evolution to support atheism makes evolution the same thing as atheism. Regardless of whether or not Dawkins is right about evolution supporting atheism, evolution and atheism are two distinct ideas. Likewise, regardless of whether or not those supporting the wedge strategy (which, incidentally, was public knowledge for years before the wedge document was written) are correct about Intelligent Design supporting the existence of God as a creator, Intelligent Design and creationism are two distinct ideas.\n \n \nHow about the fact that both ideas rely on some magical invisible being that brought everything about by some unspecified means.\n\n Simply put, Intelligent Design doesn't. ID is about finding and studying indicators of design, nothing more. The nature of the designer simply is not relevant to intelligent design. Virtually any form of designer remains a logical possibility as far as the actual evidence is concerned.\n \n Furthermore, Intelligent Design doesn't claim that everything is designed. Only objects which contain signs of intelligence are considered designed by ID advocates.",

Creationism, on the other hand, is an entirely theological idea that attempts to find support in the realm of science.\n \n Because it is theologically based, each of the following beliefs are necessarily a part of being a traditional creationist:\n \n 1. Apes and humans did not share a common ancestor.\n 2. The earth is about six thousand years old.\n 3. Life on earth did not have a common ancestor.\n 4. Changes within existing life occur only within fixed limits.\n 5. Belief in catastrophism, usually involving a global flood as the primary explanation.\n 6. There was a sudden creation of the universe, life, and energy from nothing.\n \n None of the above beliefs are part of ID theory. Because ID is derived and proven using scientific evidence, it is a much more unassuming theory. ID proposes the following:\n \n 1. Irreducible and specified complexity are reliable indicators of design. \n 2. Systems in biology exhibit irreducible and specified complexity. \n 3. Natural and/or undirected explanations are inadequate when it comes to irreducible and specified complexity. \n 4. As a result of the above three points, Intelligent Design is the best explanation for the origin of these kinds of complexity in biological systems.\n \n \n If ID advocates avoid using the G-word, it has nothing to do with public education or separation of church and state. Design theoretic reasoning doesn't give us cause to bring up God. The evidence that ID is based on points only to a designer and gives us no details about the nature of that designer.\n \n \n \n \n Having read a large amount of the trial documents and cross-examinations, I am unconvinced. Feel free to bring up any arguments from the Dover trial about ID in a new thread - I have yet to find anything new.\n \n Jones especially makes me doubtful about the way many advocates of evolution promote the trial. A total of 5,458 of the 6,004 words in Judge Jone's ruling about Intelligent Design as science came directly from a document submitted to him by the ACLU. Although this is an acceptable practice in the legal community, it leaves the question of whether or not Jones actually understood what was happening completely open. \n \n Adding to this possibility is the fact that Jones copied many out of context quotations and even complete misrepresentations of ID advocates from the ACLU. For example:\n \n Judge Jones wrote:\n \"He [Behe] was presented with fifty-eight peer-reviewed publications, nine books, and several immunology textbook chapters about the evolution of the immune system; however, he simply insisted that this was still not sufficient evidence of evolution, and that it was not good enough.\"\n \n The ACLU wrote:\n \"He [Behe] was confronted with the fifty-eight peer-reviewed publications, nine books and several immunology text-book chapters about the evolution of the immune system, P256, 280, 281, 283, 747, 748, 755 and 743, and he insisted that this was still not sufficient evidence of evolution - it was \"not good enough.\"\n \n Behe actually said:\n \"These articles are excellent articles I assume. However, they do not address the question that I am posing. So it's not that they aren't good enough. It's simply that they are addressed to a different subject\" (emphasis added)\n \n The discovery institute did a study on this that can be found here.\n \n Finally, the wishes of the intelligent design movement were not being respected at Dover. The Discovery Institute repeatedly made it clear, both in public and private, that they were not proposing teaching or referencing Intelligent Design in schools. Intelligent Design is an ongoing research program that is not ready for public education yet. While we have a lot of evidence pointing to the idea that an unknown something out there played around with an unknown number of design indicators, we still need to find a lot of details. (although, to be fair, Behe's new book about The Edge of Evolution is a huge step in the right direction) Instead of teaching ID, the Discovery Institute recommended taking a more balanced approach to evolution.\n \n \n \n \n As I mentioned earlier in this post, I agree that some have attempted to use ID to support their specific religious ideas. Again, this doesn't make ID identical to those religious ideas any more than Richard Dawkins using evolution to support atheism makes evolution the same thing as atheism. Regardless of whether or not Dawkins is right about evolution supporting atheism, evolution and atheism are two distinct ideas. Likewise, regardless of whether or not those supporting the wedge strategy (which, incidentally, was public knowledge for years before the wedge document was written) are correct about Intelligent Design supporting the existence of God as a creator, Intelligent Design and creationism are two distinct ideas.\n \n \n Simply put, Intelligent Design doesn't. ID is about finding and studying indicators of design, nothing more. The nature of the designer simply is not relevant to intelligent design. Virtually any form of designer remains a logical possibility as far as the actual evidence is concerned.\n \n Furthermore, Intelligent Design doesn't claim that everything is designed. Only objects which contain signs of intelligence are considered designed by ID advocates.\n\n \n There is absolutely no doubt that ID is nothing more than a repackaging of creationism. It is beyong ignorance to claim it isn't. We have CLEAR transitional evidence in Panda's to People. One version had several sentences that said \"creationists\". The next version attempted to replace this with \"design proponents\", but it failed in several instances and we ended up with \"cdesigproponentsists\". Quite irrefutable, my friend.",

   "... ID is based entirely on scientific evidence.\n\n Then you'll have no trouble showing us where all the pro-ID articles in peer-reviewed, scientific journals are.\n \n \nBecause it is theologically based, each of the following beliefs are necessarily a part of being a traditional creationist: [snip]\n\n Wrong. There are many flavors of creationism. The only thing they have in common is the singular assertion that they all are trying to prove anyway: Goddidit.\n \n \nID proposes the following:\n \n 1. Irreducible and specified complexity are reliable indicators of design.\n 2. Systems in biology exhibit irreducible and specified complexity.\n 3. Natural and/or undirected explanations are inadequate when it comes to irreducible and specified complexity.\n 4. As a result of the above three points, Intelligent Design is the best explanation for the origin of these kinds of complexity in biological systems.\n\n Let's address these:\n \n 1. IC and SC, as defined, aren't the least bit reliable. We know that IC structures can and do come about via exaptation and scaffolding. Behe's own favorite examples of IC have been shot down, and in numerous ways, many of which expose the ignorance of basic ideas of which Behe is guilty. Here's all you need to know about IC, even though there are several other valid counterarguments: a mousetrap without a catch still makes a fine tie clasp. That is, just because removing a part might make a structure lose its current function doesn't mean that an incomplete precursor structure was (or constituent structures were) unselectable or even unfavorable.\n IC has been defined, redefined, and re-redefined to avoid this problem, such that -- according to Dembski's newest definition -- regarding something as IC requires proving a universal negative. Oops. Additionally, Dembski has acknowledged that the whole idea of complex specified information relies on IC.\n \n 2. Systems in biology do exhibit IC and SC according to original (and Behe's second) definition. (They don't according to Dembski's newest.) But, as we can see by 1, this doesn't mean anything.\n \n 3. As explained in 1 above, natural mechanisms are perfectly adequate.\n \n 4. Three whiffs is a strikeout. Hit the showers.\n \n \nIf ID advocates avoid using the G-word, it has nothing to do with public education or separation of church and state.\n\n Are you out of the loop or just completely deluded? ID advocates let it slip all the time. They want enough distance that the courts consider it separation, but they want the connection strong enough to get the evangelical nutjobs to support them. It's such a fine line that it's nonexistent.\n \n \nA total of 5,458 of the 6,004 words in Judge Jone's ruling about Intelligent Design as science came directly from a document submitted to him by the ACLU... it leaves the question of whether or not Jones actually understood what was happening completely open. \n\n Ignoring the questionable counting, would you be so kind as to post the mere 500 words that Jones didn't \"steal\" so that we can actually try to see?\n \n \nJudge Jones wrote:\n \"He [Behe] was presented with fifty-eight peer-reviewed publications, nine books, and several immunology textbook chapters about the evolution of the immune system; however, he simply insisted that this was still not sufficient evidence of evolution, and that it was not good enough.\"\n \n ...\n \n Behe actually said:\n \"These articles are excellent articles I assume. However, they do not address the question that I am posing. So it's not that they aren't good enough. It's simply that they are addressed to a different subject\" (emphasis added)\n\n And Behe was full of horsecrap. The question is whether the immune system could have evolved without the intervention of an intelligent designer, and the evidence says yes. What Behe was actually saying was that if it's not a step-by-step account of all the changes, it's not good enough.\n If you think I'm making this up, just do some damn reading from a site that isn't DI's. Behe really does demand stepwise accounts.\n \n \nThe Discovery Institute repeatedly made it clear, both in public and private, that they were not proposing teaching or referencing Intelligent Design in schools.\n\n BULLCHIPS. They tucked their tail and ran, then proceeded to release a statement saying that they didn't promote teaching ID in schools when it became so obvious that they had f***ed themselves right in the XXX. (That's why they were trying to cover said XXX.) They were/are the ones pushing the movements in Kansas, Dover, Ohio, and South Carolina.\n \n \nIntelligent Design is an ongoing research program that is not ready for public education yet.\n\n Then where is the damn research? Your statement is the standard line of excrement that started being popularized when DI realized it was absolutely hopeless.\n If you look at Behe's proposal for an experimental test of ID, it doesn't even test the hypothesis. He says to take some organism and let it grow, waiting for mutations to come up with some novel, IC structure. If it doesn't happen, he says, then we've proved ID; if not, we've disproved it. Here's my question to Behe: if it doesn't happen, how does this prove ID? If it does happen, how do we know the intelligent designer didn't interact? The answer is: You don't. You can't. Science can't answer this question because ID isn't science.\n \n \nWhile we have a lot of evidence pointing to the idea that an unknown something out there played around with an unknown number of design indicators, we still need to find a lot of details.\n\n What evidence? Of what indicators? Care to share, or are we just supposed to swallow the lies whole because they're vague?\n \n \nInstead of teaching ID, the Discovery Institute recommended taking a more balanced approach to evolution.\n\n I think we should take a \"balanced\" approach, too: teach each view as much as the evidence supports it and explains other observations. Mayan creation myth: supported by 0% of the evidence, explains 0% of what we see, spend 0% of the time teaching it. Pastafarianism: no support, no explanatory power, no teaching. ID: no support, no explanatory power, no teaching. Evolution: 100% support, all the explanatory power, all the teaching. This is the way it works with every single other scientific subject matter; it's only the religio-nuts who want the one exception.\n \n \nVirtually any form of designer remains a logical possibility as far as the actual evidence is concerned.\n\n Virtually any form of alien remains a logical possibility as far as the actual evidence is concerned... Yep, anything's possible when you get to make sh\u00a1t up with no actual evidence.\n \n \nFurthermore, Intelligent Design doesn't claim that everything is designed. Only objects which contain signs of intelligence are considered designed by ID advocates.\n\n Right: Intelligent Designer of the Gaps. It's amazing how the Intelligent Designer gets less and less prolific as our knowledge increases...\n \n Leave it to creationists to take a clear transitional form (cdesign proponentsists) and say that it means nothing, say that there are no transitional forms, and never speak of it again.",

   "You're going to have to be more specific. The history of Intelligent Design seems almost entirely legitimate to me. The movement started back in the mid through late 1980s with the publication of several books taking a skeptical view of evolution, none of which where creationist.\nYes. That's true, but it's also true that none of them were science. Doesn't it make one wonder why this \"scientific\" movement has yet to publish any actual scientific research? There has been no data explained by an hypothesis from which a prediction was made that has been tested by experimentation. There has been nothing published in relevant scientific journals.\n \nPhillip Johnson, who was a creationist, brought together thinkers from many view points before and after the publication of his book, Darwin on Trial. including what had traditionally been labeled as young earth creationists, old earth creationists, and agnostics.\nName them.\n \nSince then, the movement has grown to encompass Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, New Age theorists, Platonists, and, yes, even atheists.\nSo the IDers claim. It's laughable. How funny that you list a bunch of religions in support of an idea that is not supposed to be about religion. I suspect that there are no atheists who are IDers.\n \nWilliam Dembski made the basic components of the theory intellectually complete with his concept of specified complexity in 1998.\nRight. First a lawyer and now a mathematician. How is it that Dembski revised his idea of specified complexity in 2002 and removed one of his essential components. If it was essential in 1998, what changed?\n \nIt is true that some members of the young earth creationist movement have tried to use ID to promote their view of Christianity, but this is hardly a problem with the ID movement itself.\nActually, it is. ID is essentially a movement of christian creationists.\n \nDawkins has done much the same thing with evolution by using it to promote his version of atheism, but that hardly makes evolution the same thing as atheism.\nActually, Dawkins doesn't use \"evolution\" to promote atheism. You are confused by his answers to attacks from creationists because they see science, especially the biological sciences, as atheistic.\n \nThe point is that both theories are based on scientific evidence that should be judged on its own merits.\nWhen can we expect to see some of the evidence for ID that we should be judging on its own merits. To date, some 20 years down the road, we have nothing but popular books written by non-scientists, or by scientists without relevant degrees (the one exception I can think of is Wells, who actually has a PhD in evolutionary biology). Please point out the peer reviewed papers on ID that form the scientific evidence that forms the so called \"theory of ID.\"\n \nWell, if that is your perspective, yes, I can see why you would think they are the same idea. However, the differences between the two theories are much, much more fundamental than just the wording.\nWhat? So even though the definitions are identical, they aren't the same. Have I got it right?\n \nPerhaps the most obvious difference is that creationism is a committed structure of theological beliefs, while ID is based entirely on scientific evidence.\nAnd we have been waiting for about 20 years for that scientific evidence. Please present it.\n \nAlthough it is true that ID has theological implications, the same could be said of evolution, the big bang, and, for that matter, any theory regarding the origin of biology and the universe.\nYou could say that only if your were being intentionally disingenuous.\n \nCreationism, on the other hand, is an entirely theological idea that attempts to find support in the realm of science.\nThat's nonsense. Only when creationists try to use government to force their religion into public schools as \"creation science\" do they claim that there is scientific support for their religious beliefs. ID is merely an effort by creationists to get their ideas into science classes by pretending that the \"designer\" is unknown (wink, wink).\n \nNone of the above beliefs are part of ID theory.\nActually, all of the above are part of ID, which isn't a theory. IDers just pretend that they aren't talking about Biblical creation.\n \nBecause ID is derived and proven using scientific evidence, it is a much more unassuming theory.\nYet another claim of scientific evidence without presenting any scientific evidence. ID is a religious idea without any scientific evidence. If it were otherwise, we would have seen some presented in the last 20 years. We would have been made aware of real scientific research not based on a religious idea.\n \nID proposes the following:\n \n 1. Irreducible and specified complexity are reliable indicators of design.\nCan you give us a reliable definition that does not yield false positives and false negatives, both of which Dembski has admitted.\n \n2. Systems in biology exhibit irreducible and specified complexity.\nSo what?\n \n3. Natural and/or undirected explanations are inadequate when it comes to irreducible and specified complexity. \nNo they aren't.\n \n4. As a result of the above three points, Intelligent Design is the best explanation for the origin of these kinds of complexity in biological systems.\nBut you are claiming that ID is a scientific theory. Where is the science. All I see is several claims that have been debunked.\n \nIf ID advocates avoid using the G-word, it has nothing to do with public education or separation of church and state. Design theoretic reasoning doesn't give us cause to bring up God. The evidence that ID is based on points only to a designer and gives us no details about the nature of that designer.\nThat's just not true according to your own authorities. You avoid mention of God purely because if you do so you will be unable to inject your religion into public schools as science. There is no design theory and there is no scientific evidence upon which it is based.\n \nHaving read a large amount of the trial documents and cross-examinations, I am unconvinced. Feel free to bring up any arguments from the Dover trial about ID in a new thread - I have yet to find anything new.\nWell, that's true. ID was debunked so completely in the past that there wasn't anything new presented. 20 years of ID and still nothing new, no scientific research, no nothing that is new. ID is a religious idea now, just as it has always been.\n \nJones especially makes me doubtful about the way many advocates of evolution promote the trial. A total of 5,458 of the 6,004 words in Judge Jone's ruling about Intelligent Design as science came directly from a document submitted to him by the ACLU. Although this is an acceptable practice in the legal community, it leaves the question of whether or not Jones actually understood what was happening completely open.\nI suspect he did.\n \nAdding to this possibility is the fact that Jones copied many out of context quotations and even complete misrepresentations of ID advocates from the ACLU. For example:\n \n Judge Jones wrote:\n \"He [Behe] was presented with fifty-eight peer-reviewed publications, nine books, and several immunology textbook chapters about the evolution of the immune system; however, he simply insisted that this was still not sufficient evidence of evolution, and that it was not good enough.\"\nBut the publications were presented in answer to Behe's claim that there were no scientific papers on the topic. It is irrelevant that he then claimed that they weren't evidence. They were evidence that Behe was either ignorant of the research in his field, or that he was lying.\n \nBehe actually said:\n \"These articles are excellent articles I assume. However, they do not address the question that I am posing. So it's not that they aren't good enough. It's simply that they are addressed to a different subject\" (emphasis added)\nI don't see your point. Behe claimed that the articles didn't exist, and then, without having read any of them, he claimed that they weren't good enough. In other words, his mind was made up and he was not willing to consider any real scientific evidence.\n \nThe discovery institute did a study on this that can be found here.\nThat's not even a study, much less science.\n \nFinally, the wishes of the intelligent design movement were not being respected at Dover.\nThey say that now.\n \nThe Discovery Institute repeatedly made it clear, both in public and private, that they were not proposing teaching or referencing Intelligent Design in schools.\nBut they have stated in the past that it is their purpose to do so.\n \nIntelligent Design is an ongoing research program that is not ready for public education yet.\nWhat research? Funny that it didn't take 20 years to develop the three BSCS biology programs. And it didn't take Miller and Levine 20 years to write their several biology texts on both a high school and college level. What seems to be the problem with ID. So far, all we have is \"Pandas and People\", wholly inadequate as a biology text, and demonstrably the product of young earth creationism.\n \nWhile we have a lot of evidence pointing to the idea that an unknown something out there played around with an unknown number of design indicators, we still need to find a lot of details.\nHow do you propose to do that? Isn't that \"unknown something out there\" a religious idea? Isn't that a \"god\" of some sort?\n \nAs I mentioned earlier in this post, I agree that some have attempted to use ID to support their specific religious ideas.\nYou, for example.\n \nAgain, this doesn't make ID identical to those religious ideas any more than Richard Dawkins using evolution to support atheism makes evolution the same thing as atheism.\nAsked and answered. ID is identical to creationism except that IDers try to avoid the mention of their god, even though they all admit that the designer is their god in private.\n \nRegardless of whether or not Dawkins is right about evolution supporting atheism, evolution and atheism are two distinct ideas. Likewise, regardless of whether or not those supporting the wedge strategy (which, incidentally, was public knowledge for years before the wedge document was written) are correct about Intelligent Design supporting the existence of God as a creator, Intelligent Design and creationism are two distinct ideas.\nWhat balderdash! ID is creationism simply because the designer is your god.\n \nID is about finding and studying indicators of design, nothing more.\nHave you found any? Outside of various debunked claims, have you published any real science on the topic? I mean, not private books. Real science published in real scientific journals.\n \nThe nature of the designer simply is not relevant to intelligent design. Virtually any form of designer remains a logical possibility as far as the actual evidence is concerned.\nRight. If you claimed otherwise then you couldn't cram your religion into public schools as science. The problem is, there is no science of ID and no theory of ID.\n \nFurthermore, Intelligent Design doesn't claim that everything is designed. Only objects which contain signs of intelligence are considered designed by ID advocates.\nI see. So you are saying that your designer is just a magical being who came about by some natural processes who then messes around with his environment. That sure sounds like science to me.",

   "Just as a reminder:\n \n \n Earth\n A sanctuary for life\n \n When humans gaze out across the universe we see galaxies colliding, supernova explosions, and a huge diversity in values such temperature, distance, and time. Events happen on such a grand scale that it is hard not to feel a little insignificant in comparison. In reality, one of the most remarkable features of our Solar System is the near-constant stability of factors such as temperature, which have nurtured the development of life on Earth. A difference of few degrees was sufficient to turn Venus into a suffocating inferno, and yet Earth has retained the delicate balance required for millions of years.\n \n \n While no single factor is responsible for the regulation, plants have an important role to play in the recycling of oxygen. If no plants existed on Earth the humans and animals would use up all the oxygen in less than 300 years. The future of the Earth's ecosystem is by no means assured. The use of phrases such as the greenhouse effect and global warming are now commonplace; in a geological blink of an eye we threaten to destroy the very balance that we depend on for life.\n \n Water is a very unusual material, with lots of perculiar properties, and many scientists have now concluded that it is an essential component for the development of life. The search for life in our solar system has now turned into the search for water. Where ever water existed in a liquid form, life may have developed and thrived. The most likely candidate at present is Europa, one of Jupiter's icey moons. It is thought that geological activity could result in a warm water ocean beneath its frozen surface. The rarity of liquid water is another indication of how lucky we are here on Earth. Our tiny planet contains so much water that if the Earth was a perfectly smooth sphere it would be covered by a single ocean 2.8 kilometres deep.\n \n \n One of our planets less obvious features is its magnetic field. Charged particles from the Sun, called the Solar Wind, pass the Earth at speeds of around a million miles per hour. As they slam into the magnetic field, a protective cocoon is created that surrounds the Earth. When the Solar Wind is particularly strong, some of the particles slip through and collide with the Earth's atmosphere, creating the spectacular aurora around the north and south poles.\n http://www.solarsystem.org.uk/earth/",

Although his model explained the atomic emission spectrum of only hydrogen, the basic concept was combined with others in Schroedinger's quantum mechanical model of the atom, which explains the emission spectra of all elements.

There is simply no reason to believe that life itself might not be common, but maybe by far the most common examples of life are simple microbial ones.

That is my point and nothing you have said deals with that issue at all.\nBWAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHA. That's good. What perfect scientific illiteracy. To actually post a link to an explanation of light spectra, and then claim that we are \"discovering\" more and more, and that there are probably thousands that we haven't discovered yet, and to state that there are \"wavelengths\" that we don't even know of yet, demonstrates dismal ignorance.\n \n Let me give an analogy to that statement. I claim that we know the numbers from one to ten (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10) but there are integers that we don't even know of yet.\n \n Or, that we are familiar with distances between 0 and 12 inches (1 foot) but that there are inches between 0 and 12 inches that we don't know of yet.\n \n In fact, a spectrum is a spectrum. There aren't a lot. Just one. Spectra are caused by the refraction of visible electromagnetic radiation (light) through a prism. The various wavelengths of light, from the shortest to the longest that are visible, are refracted to different degrees. A wavelength is a distance, and there are no unknown distances between the shortest and the longest wavelength of visible light. If you have seen a rainbow, then you have seen a spectrum.\n \n What seems to have confused Archy is the fact that light sources emit lines in their spectrum - there are bright lines caused by the emission of light from excited elements. Every element emits a specific pattern of of emission lines if it is one of the elements causing the light. On the other hand, each element also causes dark lines when it is present in a gas through which the light passes. It is these lines that tell us if a stellar object coming closer or moving away. If a star (or galaxy) is moving away, then the spectral lines are shifted towards the red end of the spectrum. The faster it is moving away, the more the red shift. Less common is blue shift, the light from stellar objects that are coming closer. One example is the Andromeda galaxy.\n \n So how is it that Archy somehow believes that the fact that every star we can see in the sky that actually has a slightly different spectrum, i.e., a minutely different shifting of emission and absorption bands, is meaningful? How does a simple fact of astrophysics somehow discount evolution or support Intelligent Design Creationism?\n \n In fact, in the matter of light spectra, emission lines, and absorption lines, there are actually no unknown spectra to be discovered. I understood spectra, emission lines, absorption lines, red shifting, and blue shifting when I was in high school, and that was back in the late 50s. What is wrong with Archy?",

   "it causes dark patches for it absorbs light of that specific frequency.\nYou claim to have read my post (#80) and still you get it wrong. As I explained, there are two kinds of spectral bands; bright bands emitted by the atoms of excited elements, and dark bands that are caused by the absorption of the same wavelength of light as it passes through clouds that contain that element. The red shift (or blue shift) usually refers to the absorption lines, although both kinds are shifted for the same reasons.\n \nOk. In fact, I'm afraid you have it backwards. This isn't about absorbtion.\nActually, he doesn't. He is just discussing only half of the issue. You are discussing the other. The absorption lines were discovered first, in fact.\n \nElements emit certain wavelengths of light when excited with energy. It's a quantum effect.\nRight. But he was talking about the absorption lines, caused by the fact that the same elements absorb the same wavelengths of light when it passes through a gas that contains that element.\nYou would see these spectral bands even if no light were shined onto the substance in question at all, all you need to do is hit them with some sort of energy and you would see the effect in question.\nRight, because they would give off light in a of a particular wavelength. On the other hand, you have to have emitted light passing through a gas to get absorption lines in the spectrum.\n \n You can see an example of a spectrum with absorption lines if you google \"red shift\". It is interesting to note that some absorption lines that are outside the visible spectrum become visible when they are red shifted into the visible range. Although the example doesn't show it, absorption lines at the red end can be shifted out of the visible range.",

Did they account for the effect Solar Winds would have on the speed of light? Or the effect the varrying densities of the Space that light traveled through had on its speed over sucha vast distance?\n\n Here is my original response:Can you explain how solar wind or varying \"spatial density\" would increase the speed of light beyond the speed limit of the universe?\n\n Here was your reply:... *cricket*...\n \n Apparently, Archie boy, your spatial density is too high to understand that if these factors were slowing the speed at which the light was traveling, that would mean that the universe is older than our estimates, not younger. Worse, as you've already had it explained to you, it's not merely the speed of light that matters, it's the Doppler shift.

I have a pretty damn good understanding of this stuff, whereas you've shown that you clearly don't have the slightest. Yes, there are EM wavelengths that we cannot \"see\" with our eyes, but there are no EM wavelengths that we cannot measure and detect. Period. We understand how gravity effects light, and we've known since before you were born. And you can't even tell us what \"spacial density\" is, most likely because you've made it up.\n \n So do we have any reason -- any whatsoever -- to believe that you've exposed some terrible error?

   "Archie, once the words are turned, they fit you exactly.\n \n Now when it comes to the age of the universe, and considered opinion, based on research and evidence, is about 14 billion years, why can't the figure 14 billion be used in normal speech? Does it have to be qualified down to nanoseconds? What's your estimation of the age of the universe or the Earth? About 6000 years? Can't you be more exact? You keep trotting out these figures as if they were established fact!\n \n Get real, Archie. Stop playing at semantics and look at what people are trying to say.\n\n \n First of all, show even one post of mine when I stated that the Earth was 6000 years old! I dare ya. And secondly, if all of the suppositions science makes are based on one fact leading to another, then it is very important that if one fact be shown to be wrong then all of the extended assumptions based on it being true must be reworked as they no longer fit.\n \n For example, let's say a miracle compound was found by science that could cure a disease. The Drug Manufacturer added to it 5 different complimentary compounds that increase its usefulness to people with varying metabolisms, blood types, ages and weights. But once they perfected it and went into long term trials they found that it spontaneously shut down the major organs of its recipients, and all at different times based on their ages, weight, metabolism and levels of absorption. \n \n When they broke it down they found that the original miracle compound was the problem and was toxic with long term exposure so the whole medicine had to be abandoned completely. My question is, could they keep the other five complimentary compounds as a potential additive to a future medicine or are they also useless as whatever new miracle compound that they came up with would require its own completely new matrix of complimentary compounds based on its unique chemical make up? Of course the five complimentary compounds are of no value apart from the original drug they were created to be used with.\n \n So it is with so many assumptions science has made regarding our origins and the origin of the Earth and Universe. If the fundamental assumptions made based on original deductions that have been proven wrong, then all of the results of those original interpretations must be thrown out as useless and new equations reworked completely. But science that you accept as reliable doesn't do that at all. They just add hundreds of millions of years or billions of years onto the age and then assume the problem is now solved.\n \n I raise this obvious flaw in science only to point out how useless what you believe is in reality. It can honestly be called a fairy tale because nothing it is based on can be confirmed or proven in reality. Now try not to turn this argument around on me and make this about creation. Try answering my question and explain how anything you believe is reliable if the foundations upon which your science is based are all wrong.",

It may be true that some of the more far reaching theories have gaps, due to unknowns, but to throw out all scientific knowledge from the base up just because we don't know everything is very short-sighted indeed.\n \n Smiley\n \n PS Make the next challenge a bit more of a . . . . challenge.",

   "Would you rather that every time any subect came up that a clause be put in that stated 'I refuse to accept any responsibility for inaccuracy in this statement due to knowledge not yet ascertained, but such knowledge is actively being sought and all data will be updated at such a time as this knowledge becomes available?' Conversations could get rather lengthy if I had to insert that clause between each sentence.\n \n Would you rather we just assumed that everything that is worth knowing is already known (which appears to be your position), and not bother trying to understand our existence further?\n \n And by the way, you meant imply (not infer).

   "Thanks for coming back, Archie boy. More easy shots.\n \n \nThis thread is titled \"Creation(Intelligent Design)\" Not the different frequencies and wavelengths of light.\n\n Translation: \"I'm running away from my specific talking points now, back to the generic conspiracy theory accusations that have already been trounced repeatedly.\"\n \n \nI raised that issue only to point out how much we don't know still. Yet some still act like what they know is the end all and be all of human knowledge.\n\n You know, Archie, you've said some really dumb things before, and you've said some really dumb things that your ignorance of the facts makes understandable for you to believe, but this is demonstrably false based on what you've said so far in this very thread.\n Consider these two true statements:\n 1. You're complaining that we don't know everything but that we act like we do.\n 2. We clearly don't know everything because we sometimes come up with refinements of our knowledge.\n Tell me, o Archie Boy, why would we be trying to refine our knowledge if we thought we knew everything there was to know? Doesn't make any sense, does it? Hence neither do you.\n On a related note, there are some people who insist that science has concluded all that it possibly can conclude and therefore want science to stop investigating observations. They're the people who think that science cannot figure out the evolutionary origin of \"complex structures\"; their viewpoint is: \"Can't know, stop looking.\" Generally speaking, these peoplare the the scientifically illiterate religious hatemongers like you. And this is precisely what you have done: you have your ultimate source to which you cling fast regardless of the mounds of evidence that show it's largely a hunk of excrement.\n \n \nAnd you people will do anything to NOT respond to the weaknesses that are inherent within your World-view. Why am I not the least bit surprised?\n\n \nYou all speak of the 14 billion year age of the Universe as if it's set in stone in every debate where you use it to support other assumptions that you just infer to be true. Don't you see that when one assumption is off or just plain wrong, then every single assumption made that is based on that original assumption being true must be reworked because the math just no longer works that caused you to come to that conclusion based on the previous assumption?\n\n What weaknesses? You brought up the EM radiation and solar wind bullchips and got your XXX kicked. You got it kicked so badly that you ran away from the subject! (And speaking of running away, why haven't you responded to any of my posts in weeks, Archie?) All you've got now is to scream that everything we have is based on assumptions, yet you can't seem to show us which assumptions are being made. Really, you're just lying because you don't like the conclusions. You lie nonstop here, Archie. It's clear that you're fighting a losing battle because all you can do is lie, lie, lie. Tell me, did Jesus tell you it's okay to lie as long as it's for Him?\n \n \nThen evolutionists realized that based on that number, the Earth and life on it didn't have enough time to evolve according to the age of rocks.\n\n Oh really? Can you show me the scientific papers where \"evolutionists\" argued -- based on evolutionary theory -- that rocks must be older? No, because you're lying again. Rocks on Earth are older than two billion years, so the universe must also be. It has nothing to do with evolution, despite the fact that you keep using evolutionary theory as your conspiratorial scapegoat. \"OMG EVEL EVILUSHUNER PEEPLE AER TEH LIEING BECUZZ THEY ARE NEED MOER EDIVENSE!\"\n \n \nSo it went to 7 billion, then to 10 billion, then to 14 billion, and now it is said to be between 10 and 20 billion years old.\n\n Which actually disproves your allegation of the impetus for refining our estimate. Why would evolutionists need to falsely increase the age of the universe beyond 4.5 billion years in order to explain evolution on a planet that has only existed for 4.5 billion years? Hell, the evolution itself has been going on for a bit less than 4 billion: why the extra ten billion years?\n Here's a hint: because that's what the evidence says.\n \n \nCan't we get any larger a gap to play with?\n\n Quit being a hypocrite. The article cited a range, but we give a high-probability estimate of ~14 billion. You use this number to rail against the scientific community for coming up with such specific values, but you rail against the scientific community for producing a range of values as well. So no matter what we say, or what the evidence says, you're ticked off at the scientific community. Tell us, ClO-, what would be an acceptable phrasing or range for expressing this data?\n \n \nThis is solid evidence that none of these assumptions are based on scientific deductions at all but are just guesses based on trying to make the pieces of preconceived notions fit.\n\n Which assumptions? Can't you tell us? I mean, all you do is sit there at your computer and say, \"OMG ASSU-UMPTIONS ASSMPUTIONS SASUMOUPTIONS!!~!#~ YUO AER ALL LIERS AND FRUADS!\" Can you actually pick any assumptions and show why they're unfounded?\n \n \nThe truth or science never even comes into it.\n\n I'd like to take this opportunity to point out the absolute irony of Archie making these claims (i.e. lying) about science in this way while whining about when the scientific community objects to global warming \"skeptics\" who concoct lies, fabricate disinformation, and purposely misinterpret data in order to push an agenda instead of elicit truth. I made a point about this in the global warming thread, too, but Archie ignored it. But then, we didn't expect him to actually respond substantively, did we?\n \n \nBut science knows they have their brain numbed lemmings like you pseudo intellectuals here who will swallow any well written dissertation thrown at you, as big words impress you and make you feel smart.\n\n Now now, Archie, just because you can't understand big words is no reason to be spiteful...\n \n \nIt doesn't matter to you, and you will never question that in just a few years they will make totally new assumptions that are based not on new evidence but on new question that the previous assumptions just don't and can't answer, EVER.\n\n Then how about you do some research yourself and come up with compelling argumentation to support your point instead of relying solely upon your pathetic lies? Yes, Archie, I'm calling you out. Do some research. Learn something about how science works, then do some science yourself. The best way to take down this terrible, conspiratorial establishment is from the inside, so prove yourself right.\n You won't. We all know that you won't, Archie boy. You don't have the understanding of the basic world around you, or the ability to not be blinded into stupidity with your pre-existing assumptions about the universe, to be the least bit productive. So we get this: you lie. You lie unabashedly. While your downright pitiful ignorance of science might make you actually not realize that your statements are false when you first make them, several of us here make it absolutely clear that your claims are just plain wrong and have no evidential support, yet you continue to knowingly promote false claims. That makes you a sinner, Archie. You are doing precisely what your God ordered you not to do. You will burn in hell for your indiscretions, and for slapping Jesus and God in the face with your willful violation of His law. Don't come running to real Christians to help you, either, because you've proven yourself to be a monstrous heathen with no regard for what God has asked you to do. You've allowed your worship of the Bible instead of Christianity to turn you into a hateful, vile, willfully ignorant liar, which is something that your God would never have helped you do.\n \n (God I love irony...)",

This obsession continued after their marriage and the acquisition of his HGV licence in June 1975, and his subsequent work as a lorry driver, took him away from home more than ever, enabling him to indulge his obsession without fear of detection. There is speculation that a bad experience with a prostitute, during one of these forays, led to the violent hatred of these women that resulted in the death of thirteen women, and the vicious attack of seven others.\n This is just such a great example of why it is a waste of time even attempting to reason with people with such limited understanding of who born again believers are to even think that this demon possessed sociopath was told to do this by God.",

But as it stands you are seriously pathetic for even attempting to lay this psychopath at Gods door in any way. \n During the time of their courtship, Sutcliffe had developed an obsession with prostitutes that he indulged together with a friend, Trevor Birdsall, and they spent a large portion of their spare time cruising red-light districts in the Yorkshire area. This obsession continued after their marriage and the acquisition of his HGV licence in June 1975, and his subsequent work as a lorry driver, took him away from home more than ever, enabling him to indulge his obsession without fear of detection. There is speculation that a bad experience with a prostitute, during one of these forays, led to the violent hatred of these women that resulted in the death of thirteen women, and the vicious attack of seven others.\n This is just such a great example of why it is a waste of time even attempting to reason with people with such limited understanding of who born again believers are to even think that this demon possessed sociopath was told to do this by God.\n\n \n He certainly believed in god, as he had had personal contact with him. So, did you happen to miss that bit?\n \n Or perhaps it was too inconvenient for you.\n \n Smiley",

   "If you had a rational thought in your brain you would be intelligent enough to deduce that a man who butchers 13 women can't be relied upon for being lucid when he say's that God told him to do it.\n\n Frankly, I agree. But then, if somebody were to say that he heard God tell him to go out and help a dozen homeless people, I wouldn't consider him reliably lucid either.\n This is the real problem with your reasoning: You've already determined what you think is \"reasonable\" for what God might or might not say. See below.\n \n \nIf you were really as smart as you like to imply you could easily reason that the same Jesus who said let he who is without sin to cast the first stone at the prostitute, wouldn't order a man to go kill 13 prostitutes.\n\n How can you know it's not the other way around? You could easily reason that a God who told a man to kill 13 prostitutes must not have been embodied in some guy who said that only a non-sinner can begin stoning prostitutes. Therefore, Jesus was clearly not God.\n The only reason you've gone this direction is that you have already decided what attributes you want God to have, so you're ignoring the rest. I can bring up all the Old Testament stories that I want showing how evil and murderous God actually is (Job, Lot's wife, sabbath-breakers), and you'd hand-wave it away. No doubt you'd claim that that was the old way, and that things have changed. But then who's to say that things haven't changed again? You certainly can't; you're working from a priori beliefs that you refuse to change.\n \n God's characteristics and orders depend only upon what believers in God already think, and therefore God's characteristics and orders change based on what believers think. This is demonstrable throughout history and still true today. Archie, whether he knows it or not, epitomizes this fact.\n \n \nBut why would I expect one who is so irrational as to believe in the fairy tale of evolution to be able to make such logical leaps of common sense deductions.\n\n Here's a challenge, Archie: if you'd like to defend your lies about evolution, propose a resolution for a formal debate.

You lose.\n\n \n First of all this thread was originally about creation/intelligent design and how they differ from each other. It has been derailed in many different directions but I haven't attempted to prove Gods existence anywhere as I believe God is self evident and is apparent by just observing the World around us and the natural cycle of life.\n \n It is also important to understand that God will reveal Himself to each of us individually if we seek Him with a sincere desire to find Him. But the spiritual realm is also entering into the supernatural, or extra natural. That is what the spiritual part of being human is and how we commune with the author of life. Spiritually, not through testable experiments in a laboratory like in a science experiment. So your demand for evidence from me is based in total ignorance and your lack of understanding of the spiritual aspect of our humanity.\n \n \nSince 'God' is imaginary people can give whatever characteristics they want to this figure. Yours are no more valid.\n\n \n Wrong again Klown, my experiences are personal just as untold millions of other human beings have had the same experience as I have and know exactly what I am speaking about regarding personal revelation. You seriously deceive yourself by assuming that just because you are spiritually dead to that aspect of your humanity and reject rather than accept the living God reaching out to you, that He is imaginary in any way at all. \n \n Because I promise you that even if you go through this whole life experience denying and ignoring Gods existence, once you shed the flesh of this life on Earth you will \"instantaneously\" know that you have missed the eternal mark and wasted your whole life focussing on that which led you to death and separation from all that was important in reality. Seek the truth NOW while you have life and stop demanding evidence from others that God is real and loves you as this life is an individual journey and God wants a personal relationship with you, not as part of a group. \n \n This is good advice offered in love and concern for your eternal condition.

All I did was receive a free gift that i never could have earned with my own righteousness, because I deserve eternal separation from God as I am as big a sinner as everyone I tell needs what jesus so freely offers to all of us through His death on the Cross.\n\n \n Allow me to interpret these inane ramblings.\n \n The first couple of paragraphs are asking how you, a snivelling little godless nothing, could possibly be judging the great Archie, the prideful one, as he is in touch with the great being. He then accuses you of lots of stuff that is far more typical of himself.\n \n He then goes on to say that you do not have to look for god as god has already found you and all you have to do is open the door to him. Unfortunately, even if you do open the door, the chances are this god will not be there as you have obviously opened the wrong door, and you could presumably open the wrong door over and over again for the rest of your life. It has to be your fault if you fail to open the correct door, as god is perfect, and you are not. Though there is always the chance that god went to the wrong house, because you didn't give him your change of address. Silly you.\n \n Then there's another bit about Archie's own experience. So you can ignore that bit.\n \n Then comes the interesting bit.\n \n This is Archie's interpretation of the way things really are. He has said this before, so hopefully I can get it right.\n \n 1 - Jesus shed his blood for our sins.\n 2 - So all you have to do is accept him as your saviour and your seat in heaven will be reserved for you.\n 3 - Point 2 means that you can be the most obnoxious, selfish, moronic git in the world for the rest of your life, but you still get in because you are a 'believer' (please note I have made no personal comparisons here).\n 4 - Oh! And point 2 is the only way to get your reservation (point 3 still applies).\n 5 - That's about it.\n \n But let's look at this more closely, because the extrapolation of the above is the really interesting bit.\n \n So, Jesus shed his blood for our sins. If you accept him as your saviour, you get in, if you don't you burn for eternity.\n \n So let's say you have never heard of this guy, but you are an upstanding member of your remote little society; you haven't killed 13 women at the bequest of some superior being; you are just a nice person. Along comes this missionary to save you (that's there usual excuse). He teaches you all about this great guy who hung around with the worst people he could find, he cured people, did some great party tricks and eventually was persecuted and killed. But then he rose again from the dead and now lives somewhere up in the sky, apparently. But you are a fairly simple type and just can't get your head round all this strange information. Do you believe, or do you politely say goodbye to this missionary and go about your life as you always have done, being nice to people and animals and even the odd missionary who keeps telling you that you've made the wrong decision?\n \n So, before the missionary arrived, you were a nice person who god couldn't possibly send 'down there', at least not if he's a true, righteous and just god. Now you're a nice person who has heard the word of god, but just can't bring yourself to believe in all this supernatural mumbo-jumbo.\n \n Has the missionary saved you, or has be condemned you?\n \n So, did Jesus come to save us or condemn us?\n \n I know what Archie thinks. I am already a tool of Satan, and I'm sure he'll have a few more insults lined up for me. But don't worry, his seat is already reserved and they are burning mine right now, just to be sure I don't sneak in the back door and steal the vol au vents.\n \n So, to recap.\n \n 1 - Before Jesus, you could get away with being a nice guy (or gall - not that galls were really considered back then) and you would probably be okay.\n 2 - After Jesus, being nice doesn't come into it. You can be a really nice non-believer and you'll burn, or you can be an obnoxious believer and be saved.\n 3 - Sounds like a true, righteous and just god to me. You?\n \n Smiley",

(You don't have to download the whole thing to watch it; just move the slider bar.)\n \n I'm pleased -- or perhaps not so pleased -- to say that I've misremembered things. Instead of bringing up murder and child molestation, he brought up rape and pedophilia. Frankly, considering his job, we end up on the losing end either way.\n \n link\n \n I'll put together a transcript of the very juicy part:Dawkins: Let me ask about another thing in the book, which was about AIDS and HIV. I think somewhere it talks about AIDS being the wages of sin. Is that mixing health education with moralistic preaching?\n \n Hawkes: Well, I suppose the flip side of that is that if there is no God there is no lawgiver. Why does it matter what I do? Why is rape wrong? Why is pedophilia wrong? Why are any of these things wrong if there is no lawgiver?\n \n Dawkins: You've just said a very revealing thing. Are you telling me that the only reason why you don't steal and rape and murder is that you're frightened of God?\n \n Hawkes: I think that all people, if they think that they can get away with something and it is there are no consequences, we actually tend to do that. I think that is the reality. Look at the world in which we live. That is the reality.\n Quite clearly, this guy is saying that if there were no consequences with respect to a lawgiver, rape and pedophilia (and stealing and murder) would be things he'd \"tend\" to do.\n \n You can issue a retraction anytime, Archie.",

   "Electrolyte, there is no point in listing Archie's hypocracies. As I stated in my last post (a point which Archie has endorsed in the past), it does not matter what sins Archie commits now, because he is gullible enough to believe that Jesus died for him, his seat at the final table is reserved regardless of how obnoxious he is now.\n\n Then at least I can point out the hypocrisy to passers-by. It's one thing when Archie rails against the condemnation of his actions when they come from a worldview that he detests, but I get great enjoyment out of pointing out that Archie is breaking his own rules. He claims to be such an upstanding Christian, defender of the faith, follower of Christ, but anyone can see that Archie is actually failing miserably and being a good Christian.\n \n The fact that this doesn't bother him is doubly good for convincing passers-by of the shortcomings of his position.\n \n \nNow if my god were this stupid, I'd die of embarassment, but apparently, not all of us are so discerning.\n\n From what I can tell, Archie may be incapable of both embarrassment and discernment.

   "First of all this thread was originally about creation/intelligent design and how they differ from each other. It has been derailed in many different directions but I haven't attempted to prove Gods existence anywhere as I believe God is self evident and is apparent by just observing the World around us and the natural cycle of life.\n \n It is also important to understand that God will reveal Himself to each of us individually if we seek Him with a sincere desire to find Him. But the spiritual realm is also entering into the supernatural, or extra natural. That is what the spiritual part of being human is and how we commune with the author of life. Spiritually, not through testable experiments in a laboratory like in a science experiment. So your demand for evidence from me is based in total ignorance and your lack of understanding of the spiritual aspect of our humanity.\n\n \n Why should I take your unsupported claims seriously? Why are you attempting to debate your beliefs while admitting that you have no evidence to support them? Do you actually think you can win these debates without any evidence? Are you unaware that if you provide no evidence for your superstitious claims that they will be disregarded? Are you unfamiliar with the 'burden of proof'?\n \n Can you give me a logical reason to believe your claims?\n \n Do you now admit to defeat? If not, on what grounds do you defend your position?\n \n \nWrong again Klown, my experiences are personal just as untold millions of other human beings have had the same experience as I have and know exactly what I am speaking about regarding personal revelation. You seriously deceive yourself by assuming that just because you are spiritually dead to that aspect of your humanity and reject rather than accept the living God reaching out to you, that He is imaginary in any way at all. \n \n Because I promise you that even if you go through this whole life experience denying and ignoring Gods existence, once you shed the flesh of this life on Earth you will \"instantaneously\" know that you have missed the eternal mark and wasted your whole life focussing on that which led you to death and separation from all that was important in reality. Seek the truth NOW while you have life and stop demanding evidence from others that God is real and loves you as this life is an individual journey and God wants a personal relationship with you, not as part of a group. \n \n This is good advice offered in love and concern for your eternal condition. I know it wont be taken in that spirit but it is intended in that spirit.\n\n \n Preaching doesn't work on people who think that it's all BS.",

May it never be!\n Rom 9:15 For He says to Moses, \"I WILL HAVE MERCY ON WHOM I HAVE MERCY, AND I WILL HAVE COMPASSION ON WHOM I HAVE COMPASSION.\"\n Rom 9:16 So then it {does} not {depend} on the man who wills or the man who runs, but on God who has mercy.\n Rom 9:17 For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, \"FOR THIS VERY PURPOSE I RAISED YOU UP, TO DEMONSTRATE MY POWER IN YOU, AND THAT MY NAME MIGHT BE PROCLAIMED THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE EARTH.\"\n Rom 9:18 So then He has mercy on whom He desires, and He hardens whom He desires.\n Rom 9:19 You will say to me then, \"Why does He still find fault? For who resists His will?\"\n Rom 9:20 On the contrary, who are you, O man, who answers back to God? The thing molded will not say to the molder, \"Why did you make me like this,\" will it?\n Rom 9:21 Or does not the potter have a right over the clay, to make from the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for common use?\n Rom 9:22 What if God, although willing to demonstrate His wrath and to make His power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction?\n Rom 9:23 And {He did so} to make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He prepared beforehand for glory,\n Rom 9:24 {even} us, whom He also called, not from among Jews only, but also from among Gentiles.\n Rom 9:25 As He says also in Hosea, \"I WILL CALL THOSE WHO WERE NOT MY PEOPLE, 'MY PEOPLE,' AND HER WHO WAS NOT BELOVED, 'BELOVED.' \"\n Rom 9:26 \"AND IT SHALL BE THAT IN THE PLACE WHERE IT WAS SAID TO THEM, 'YOU ARE NOT MY PEOPLE,' THERE THEY SHALL BE CALLED SONS OF THE LIVING GOD.\"",

I was as convinced as anyone that God existed, but I was convinced in heart and mind, and not through rational scrutiny. I wasn't studying theology, or evangelising in order to find God, because I believed I'd found him. And no one can say I wasn't sincere in finding and loving God.

An allegation that this country was founded on Christian principles? If only there had been some debate over this topic where arguments from both sides were presented and defended, some more successfully than others.\n \n Oh, wait! Right here on this very forum, there was such a debate, and the judges returned a unanimous decision! I'd like to direct Archie to this thread. Archie, if you'd like to make comments, you can do so in the Ringside thread. \n\n \n So do you believe that debate showed that the US was generally not founded on Christian principles?\n \n \n \n \n From post #132;\n \n \nHere's a challenge, Archie: if you'd like to defend your lies about evolution, propose a resolution for a formal debate. Otherwise, we'll continue to label you a cowardly liar. \n\n \n The ringside forum led me to make this observation a few days ago;\n \n \n.....I think his \"trust me on this\" has been well proven. Affirmatives seldom win - there have only been four so far, out of 15 debates.\n\n \n One thought does tend to lead to another. The topics of those four debates have been; \n \n *The Confederate flag,\n *Homosexual marriage,\n *Demoralized populace (concerning BinLaden), and\n *Torture and terrorism\n \n Nothing even coming close to evolution, or science. In looking through ALL formal debate proposals, there hasn't been a single one made by evolutionists concerning evolution or religion. I don't think evolutionists have much room to taunt creationists about making formal debate resolutions, do you? Why was wascallywabbit never challanged? Why was the skeptic never challanged? It appears the skeptic has been bullied away yet again. Was it a goal of evolutionists to drive them away? \n \n Here's a challange for you - you or any of the other 10 or 20 that enjoy hammering on Archangel on a regular basis could come up with a reasonable resolution on your brand of godless science or evolution sometime in 2008. May I start it off with a suggestion? From post #23 of this thread;\n \n \nActually, Dawkins doesn't use \"evolution\" to promote atheism. \n\n \n Would you or him like to make that a resolution? Let's see; RESOLVED - \"Richard Dawkins doesn't use evolution to promote atheism\". \n \n I'll do the negative on that. After five affirmatives, I sure would like to try a negative sometime - they look dead easy to me. If the above Dawkins one doesn't work for you (har), may I look forward to doing a (philosophical or historical) negative with one of you atheists this year? :)",

   "Why don't you (and 10 or 20 more of your gang, if necessary) run through this, and I'll try to answer any questions that you may have.\n\n I've given it a once-over, and I don't see any quotes from Dawkins equating science and atheism, and I don't see any quotes at all from Hitchens. So you've failed to produce what you said exists. Which leads to my first question:\n 1. Why, after insisting repeatedly that Dawkins uses science to promote atheism and being asked to provide documentation to that effect, was this the best you could do?\n \n The author says that evolution explains the origin of the universe. It does not. Evolutionary theory addresses only the change in life forms.\n 2. Why is the author lying? Is the author a XXXXX?\n 3. Why should we believe this guy?\n \n The author is so dimwitted as to admit a serious flaw in his wishful portrayal of evolution as a religion: theistic evolutionists. If evolution is a religion, and religions foment following of the religion, and -- as you scream -- evolution is atheistic, then\n 4. How can theistic evolutionists be atheistic?\n \n The author attacks the Humanist Manifestos as being \"biased.\" But a manifesto by definition a statement of why one thinks a viewpoint is correct.\n 5. When a mathematician writes a collection of geometry proofs, does that make geometry qualify as a religion under this criterion?\n 6. When a sports fan makes an impassioned argument that his favorite team is the best in its league, and shows bias in his statements and/or beliefs, does this fandom qualify as a religion?\n \n The author tries to draw parallels between evolution and a number of other \"systems.\" One that the author picks is socialism...\n 7. Since when is socialism a religion?\n \n The author takes a tiny piece of a Time article about the Cambrian explosion and paints it as a damning mystery that contradicts evolutionary theory.\n 8. Is this type of dipshittery the best that this guy can do?\n 9. If this guy is still trying to pass off Darwin's original statements as accurate representations of modern theory, why should we regard him as even slightly reliable for an analysis of evolution?\n \n The author presents Francis Hitching as \"an evolutionist,\" but Hitching is not a believer in evolution, nor is he a practicing scientist. He lies about his source material for the book and about his qualifications and honors. In other words, he's a hack. All of the author's \"conclusions\" drawn from Hitching's statements are from disinformation.\n 10. Why does the author -- who admits that this criterion is the hardest to meet for evolution -- try to meet it using information from a fraudulent hack?\n \n \nTo summarize, evolution satisfies my criteria for the definition of religion. It adopts a paradigm, or narrative, to explain life's origins, its obligations, the origin of religion, and our eventual destiny and salvation. The events that make up evolutionist theory are so numerous that it cannot in principle in any way be falsified using our scientific knowledge. Evolution is believed for emotional and philosophical reasons, by faith. True believes can always pick and choose what events confirm belief in evolution and what events do not count as confirmation. The emotional crutch evolution creates causes its adherents to be very biased against other views of reality.\n\n 11. If astronomy hasn't made any conclusions about the origin of the universe, it's not science, but as soon as astronomers have enough information to make hypotheses about how the universe might have come about, the discipline of astronomy becomes a religion? More numbskullery.\n 12. Where the hell does evolutionary theory say anything about salvation?\n 13. If evolution were unfalsifiable, why do creationists keep forwarding arguments about radiocarbon dating and radiohaloes and arguing that evolution is falsified?\n 14. Why would the fact that evolution has support from \"so numerous\" an amount of disciplines, experiments, observations, etc., be something that works against evolutionary theory? This is just more dipshittery.\n \n 15. In what way does this author's entire ignorance-laced, self-contradictory diatribe amount to anything more than a slew of false accusations, misrepresentations, and incredibly weak alleged connections?",

You guys are too much. in all of your pomposity you have no problem allowing for variances that completely change the rate of expansion and thus the final outcome of the complete Universe, while simultaneously claiming that beyond that little bump, we really do understand what happened. \n \n \nYep\n\n \n And even though no scientist knows what caused or started the Big Bang at all, you will reverse your original claim that god may have done it only to then back pedal and say this, as if I brought up God doing it first. And you insist that it is also reasonably understood by science how a mass of matter the size of a grain of sand expanded not into a solid mass of matter but into all of time and space which contains all of the matter in the Universe? And before you fall back on your old standby that I'm too anti-science to get it, If I didn't understand the concept and couldn't visualize what is being said then I could never form the questions I have. So rather than claim intellectual superiority, either answer the questions directly or just do the right thing and admit science just doesn't know the answers.\n \n \nVery true. I'm quite comfortable with saying \"I don't know, beats me\". If Archie claims that god did it, I can't say \"No, he didn't, because...\" simply because we don't know.

You can say \"goddidit\" or \"If god wanted me to know, it would be in the bible!\". Ignorance is always easier.\n\n \n THEN SAY YOU DON'T KNOW TQ!!! Because you don't know. It's called the Big Bang THEORY for a reason you know, and that is because it isn't a scientific fact but a scientific belief based on certain assumptions that remain to be proven. \n \n \n seem to be a little preoccupied with my supposed cowardice. Why is that?\n\n \n Not at all. I just marvel at how sanctimonious you are with nothing reliable to base it on.\n \n \n why would I admit that when I do have a clue?\n\n \n Right, because you would rather believe and defend the unknowable rather than admit it is unknowable.\n \n \nNo matter how many times you insist science is a religion, it's not going to come true. If you have a specific issue with the cosmology you're dismissing, could you please post it?\n\n \n I don't insist that science is A religion. I insist it is YOUR religion (as false as it is) as it is what you and your boyfriend place all of your faith in regarding your origin and the origin of all that is. That is Gods domain, the spiritual domain, but you reject that and hold to the secular humanist and atheistic explanation of how everything got here, going all the way back to the big bang THEORY which you defend as a scientific fact now. That pretty accurately defines a religion in case you didn't notice. \n \n \nnot bad for going by memory, Ionly missed it by 10-11.\n\n \n But according to your boyfriend, you didn't miss at all. That difference is the accepted variation in the scientific community according to lyte. Which I can find no where in the evidence mind you. You see, that is why debating with him is such a waste of time, because he will always find a way to justify anything said by his side as he attempts to obfuscate dishonestly and imply it was the other side that got it wrong. He is a disingenuous philosophical coward who wouldn't know the actual truth if he tripped over it and you lose all credibility because you team up with him and defend his lies and obfuscations as you two tag team me or anyone else who dares to oppose your personal religion of science.\n \n So lytes biggest assumption of all is to think that because I don't respond to him is because he destroys me in every post he makes that goes completely unchallenged. The reality is that he isn't worth responding to precisely for the reason I outline above, because he distorts, manipulates and changes the goal posts every time a point is made he can't overcome. I choose not to debate a person who is disingenuous and more concerned with out maneuvering an opponent rather than debating issues honestly.",

Evolutionary theory, as Darwin envisaged it, explains the origin of species, and proposes some testable mechanisms of speciation.

Even if the laws change, it is anticipated they will change in an orderly manner, and not arbitrarily on some creator's whim.\n \nIf you don't believe in the power of intelligent questioning in obtaining answers why bother asking ?\n\n \n Quite so.

   "This is all pretty moot because Archie boy has me on ignore -- apparently he can't handle the heat of his entire universe-view collapsing in on him -- but it's fun, and maybe somebody will take the better parts and produce a response that he won't ignore.\n \n \nEven though according to your boyfriend it's between 10-32 and 10-43 seconds.\n\n So now I'm T.Q's boyfriend? If you're jealous, Archie, just say so...\n \n \nyou have no problem allowing for variances that completely change the rate of expansion and thus the final outcome of the complete Universe, while simultaneously claiming that beyond that little bump, we really do understand what happened.\n\n What variances?\n \n \nAnd even though no scientist knows what caused or started the Big Bang at all, you will reverse your original claim that god may have done it only to then back pedal and say this, as if I brought up God doing it first.\n\n Hume dispatched with this pitiful argument long ago. We don't need to know an entire, complete lineage of cause-and-effect events to know anything about event #43560. We can know enough about events #43500-43559 and be damn sure about what caused #43560. Not knowing the \"cause\" of the big bang does not negate the evidence supporting it any more than my not knowing your mother negates your existence.\n \n \nAnd you insist that it is also reasonably understood by science how a mass of matter the size of a grain of sand expanded not into a solid mass of matter but into all of time and space which contains all of the matter in the Universe? And before you fall back on your old standby that I'm too anti-science to get it, If I didn't understand the concept and couldn't visualize what is being said then I could never form the questions I have.\n\n But the question that you're oh-so-proud about formulating shows that you don't understand. The universe at the time was only as large as the singularity. The universe has been expanding as well. There was no empty space, there was no \"before the big bang,\" and \"all of time and space\" is the universe, which must contain all matter and energy according to the first law of thermodynamics.\n \n \nDoes the word hypocrite mean anything to you chumps?\n\n Archie calling somebody a hypocrite. There's irony for you.\n \n \nTHEN SAY YOU DON'T KNOW TQ!!! Because you don't know. It's called the Big Bang THEORY for a reason you know, and that is because it isn't a scientific fact but a scientific belief based on certain assumptions that remain to be proven.\n\n It's called gravitational theory, too. Care to take a stroll off a cliff?\n Perhaps you'd like to argue against the quantum mechanical model of the atom. After all, it's just a model, right?\n See, Archie, in your great scientific illiteracy, you've succumbed to the most common numbskullery argument that exists: that some scientific theory is \"only a theory.\" In my classes, we stress the scientific method, which produces sets of repeatedly well-supported hypotheses that explain a general observation, and we call those sets theories. They are not guesses, mere beliefs, or assumptions.\n Archie, do you ever watch the show Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader? The status of a scientific theory is learned in fifth grade science, and here you sit, ignorant of the facts.\n I have repeatedly challenged Archie to list assumptions made by evolutionary theory. He hasn't done so. I'm less well-versed on Big Bang theory, but if Archie wants to list assumptions made by Big Bang theory, I'll see what I can do about showing him to be wrong yet again.\n \n \nNot at all. I just marvel at how sanctimonious you are with nothing reliable to base it on.\n\n Heaps of observable evidence, logic, and reason are \"nothing reliable,\" but an ancient book by goat herders is your ultimate source of understanding?\n \n \nRight, because you would rather believe and defend the unknowable rather than admit it is unknowable.\n\n I stand by my previous statement. Currently unknown is not necessarily unknowable, regardless of how much Archie wants us to think it is. Taking an unknown and declaring it to be known based solely on the fact that it is unknown is paradoxical and fallacious.\n \n \nyou reject that and hold to the secular humanist and atheistic explanation of how everything got here,\n\n It's the scientific explanation of how everything got here. Atheists aren't the only ones who accept the Big Bang theory. You have the same problem as marc: your definitions give you theistic atheists, even Christian atheists.\n \n \ngoing all the way back to the big bang THEORY which you defend as a scientific fact now.\n\n The theory is based on scientific facts. You just don't know or understand any of them.\n \n \nThat difference is the accepted variation in the scientific community according to lyte.\n\n You've got severe reading comprehension problems, Archie. When did I say that there was variation in this model according to scientists? All I said was that you can't read a diagram. Between 10^-43 seconds and 10^-32 seconds after singularity, there was rapid expansion of the universe. It is not that case that one scientist says that some characteristic of the universe was achieved at Planck time when another says it was not achieved until 10^-32 seconds after singularity. In other words, you're making false statements; whether you know them to be false only determines whether you're a liar or a fraud.\n \n \nWhich I can find no where in the evidence mind you. You see, that is why debating with him is such a waste of time, because he will always find a way to justify anything said by his side as he attempts to obfuscate dishonestly and imply it was the other side that got it wrong.\n\n I challenge Archie once again to provide any case where I was dishonest in discussing any issue with him.\n \n \nHe is a disingenuous philosophical coward\n\n Who is trying to get you to quit hiding, to come out and defend yourself? You have me on ignore, little boy; you are the one who won't respond to me, so you are in no position to call me a coward. I've challenged you repeatedly to back up your lies, but you continue to hunker in your foxhole and toss pathetic potshots like calling me a liar, self-serving, T.Q's boyfriend, and countless other prohibited slanderous labels. For you to call me a coward when it is quite clear that your behavior is infinitely more cowardly than mine only makes it easier for me to point out how completely out of touch with reality and utterly devoid of reason and credibility you are.\n But, you know, keep it coming, because I love getting the chance to rip into you like this so often. If only you weren't so cowardly that you'd read it...\n \n \nyou lose all credibility because you team up with him and defend his lies and obfuscations as you two tag team me or anyone else who dares to oppose your personal religion of science.\n\n Hey Archie, a few posts ago, I posted a response to T.Q saying that I whole-heartedly disagree with him. I respond to whom I want to respond, but -- unlike you -- I don't run away.\n \n \nSo lytes biggest assumption of all is to think that because I don't respond to him is because he destroys me in every post he makes that goes completely unchallenged. The reality is that he isn't worth responding to precisely for the reason I outline above, because he distorts, manipulates and changes the goal posts every time a point is made he can't overcome. I choose not to debate a person who is disingenuous and more concerned with out maneuvering an opponent rather than debating issues honestly.\n\n I'm still waiting for Archie to show even one instance of these things of which I'm being accused. He won't do it because he can't. He put me on ignore after I kicked his XXX on atheism and morality, posing several questions that he could not even begin to answer. Rather than address the paradox that his worldview elicits that I demonstrated with hypotheticals, he accused me of making false statements about God, which I never did.",

   "Science believing by faith that life formed from non-living matter? I thought science wasn't faith based?\n\n It's not. This is the hypothesis that is best supported by scientific facts. That's how science works; you'd know that if you were smarter than a fifth grader.\n \n \nEvolutionists please explain how cells, once they emerged from lifeless matter diversified into the many life forms we see today.\n\n You want this done in a single post? There are entire volumes written about this. I know you'll refuse to read Dawkins, but you could read Gould instead.\n \n \nMostly ALL scientist say that when considering the probability of the assembly of a DNA molecule the calculations are one in 10 to the power of 100 billion.\n\n No, only anti-evolutionist hacks make this argument. No model of biological development contains random assembly of a DNA molecule. Not a single qualified scientist makes that claim.\n \n \nSince all the components of the first cell came from the environment, how did it get the ability (information) to make or assemble these components?\n\n See RNA World hypothesis. See also Hatena for examples of incorporation of separate systems.\n \n \nMany here claim I am narrow-minded and Uneducated for believing in God,\n\n No, you are narrow minded for refusing to discuss aspects of your worldview that you know won't stand up to scrutiny. You are uneducated because you don't know and refuse to learn basics of many disciplines such as philosophy, biology, chemistry, and physics. I know many, many people who are neither narrow-minded nor uneducated and believe in the same God you do. Theism is not the determining factor, no matter how much you want to try to spin it to appear that way.\n \n \nso please.. please just one person answer these questions.\n\n Done. But you don't read my posts because you're too busy ignoring the answers you claim to want. So when you \"beg\" for somebody to answer, we know you really have no interest in the answer, you just think that there is no answer and want others to think the same.\n \n \nIt's easy to try and back Christians in a corner, but can you back up your own beliefs?\n\n I do. All the time. You don't read what I said because I back up my beliefs.\n \n \nWhy is it dozens (on here) can critisize my beliefs, but less than 10 can (attempt) to answer my questions like my last one?\n\n How come you ignore everyone who answers your questions?\n \n \nThen what right do you have to teach and confidently proclaim that life came from nothing?\n\n Check any biology textbook. Very little is said about the origin of life. All of my (many) textbooks tell the reader that evidence is too scant to make a declaration about what happened. Instead -- as is true for any aspect of science -- we present what is best supported by the evidence, but we spend more time teaching about that which we are more confident.\n \n \nAnd I notice you completely avoided actually answering my questions.\n\n I answered your questions; I noticed you completely avoided actually reading my answers. ClO-.\n \n \nAnd that is because you can't explain how life came from nothing.\n\n It didn't \"come from nothing.\" That's the creationist version of events. Remember, \"Creatio ex nihilo\"?\n \n \nHow the first strand of DNA, Since all the components of the first cell came from the environment, how did it get the ability (information) to make or assemble these components?\n\n Life didn't originate with DNA. If Archie had any real desire for his questions to be answered, he'd read up on RNA World hypothesis.\n \n \nThe very implication that it happened originally goes against every other aspect of how random mutation and evolution occurs at all.\n\n Actually, it doesn't go against these things in the slightest. More importantly, though, how would Archie \"know\" that these things go against other aspects if he doesn't even know the model? Answer: Archie already has the answers -- or rather, he thinks he does. He doesn't give a rat's XXX about what the models, hypotheses, and theories actually say. He has already rejected them out-of-hand. He has his belief system, and all the evidence in the universe will not cause him to change his mind. This, my friends, is religion-induced stupor, the shutdown of intellectual inquiry caused by arrogant assuredness dreaded by scientists everywhere.",

   "I've given it a once-over, and I don't see any quotes from Dawkins equating science and atheism, and I don't see any quotes at all from Hitchens. So you've failed to produce what you said exists. Which leads to my first question:\n 1. Why, after insisting repeatedly that Dawkins uses science to promote atheism and being asked to provide documentation to that effect, was this the best you could do? \n\n \n \n Where did I say it was the best I could do? I'm being cautious - I can't give away future secrets. It will all be revealed to you when the formal debate about it happens. You know, in 2008 when an evolutionist actually puts forward an affirmative, for the first time on 4forums. \n \n \n \nThe author says that evolution explains the origin of the universe. It does not. Evolutionary theory addresses only the change in life forms. \n\n \n Depending on how it's defined at any given time, it also attempts to explain \"biological reasons for human behavior\".\n \n \n2. Why is the author lying? Is the author a XXXXX? \n\n \n I'm sorry - this would be a fallicious question. (did I spell that right?) :p \n \n \n3. Why should we believe this guy? \n\n \n Like myself, he probably realizes that evolution has many definitions. He has probably read some of Dawkins or Hitchens work. \n \n \nThe author is so dimwitted as to admit a serious flaw in his wishful portrayal of evolution as a religion: theistic evolutionists. If evolution is a religion, and religions foment following of the religion, and -- as you scream -- evolution is atheistic, then\n 4. How can theistic evolutionists be atheistic? \n\n \n It's the definitions thing - evolution should not be a religion, but it has been taken to that level. A small handful of theistic evolutionists attempt to keep evolution in its narrow, secular realm. Most theistic evolutionists are simply phonies. The ONLY WAY to recognize a sincere theistic evolutionist would be to see one take serious exception to most claims by the phony theistic evolutionists. (those who completely harmonize with atheists) I'm still waiting for that to happen on 4forums for the first time also. \n \n \nThe author attacks the Humanist Manifestos as being \"biased.\" But a manifesto by definition a statement of why one thinks a viewpoint is correct.\n 5. When a mathematician writes a collection of geometry proofs, does that make geometry qualify as a religion under this criterion? \n\n \n No because geometry isn't involved in social decisions, as evolutionary thought is. Evolutionary thought is largely about purposelessness, and it has many social implications and applications. \n \n \n \n6. When a sports fan makes an impassioned argument that his favorite team is the best in its league, and shows bias in his statements and/or beliefs, does this fandom qualify as a religion? \n\n \n No, because sports are not used to make political decisions concerning purpose and morality. Being a passionate sports fan does not fit his somewhat extensive criteria for being a religion. \n \n \nThe author tries to draw parallels between evolution and a number of other \"systems.\" One that the author picks is socialism...\n 7. Since when is socialism a religion? \n\n \n He didn't claim socialism was a religion (you made a straw man emoticon_wow ) but it goes along with evolution perfectly. If evolution claims we're here because of undirected natural events, (as does atheism) then humans are the highest form of intelligence on earth, and only certain humans are capable of knowing what is best for everyone. History bears it out - atheism and personal liberty haven't gone together in past societies. \n \n \nThe author takes a tiny piece of a Time article about the Cambrian explosion and paints it as a damning mystery that contradicts evolutionary theory.\n 8. Is this type of dipshittery the best that this guy can do? \n\n \n Again I believe we have another fallacy, that wasn't a question, it was a vulgar taunt. Is that the best you can do? \n \n \n9. If this guy is still trying to pass off Darwin's original statements as accurate representations of modern theory, why should we regard him as even slightly reliable for an analysis of evolution? \n\n \n Probably because he knows how popular the Darwinist prophets, Richard Dawkins and Kenneth Miller are. They both constantly try to pass off Darwin's original statements as accurate representations of modern theory. You didn't know that? \n \n \nThe author presents Francis Hitching as \"an evolutionist,\" but Hitching is not a believer in evolution, nor is he a practicing scientist. He lies about his source material for the book and about his qualifications and honors. In other words, he's a hack. All of the author's \"conclusions\" drawn from Hitching's statements are from disinformation.\n 10. Why does the author -- who admits that this criterion is the hardest to meet for evolution -- try to meet it using information from a fraudulent hack? \n\n \n \n That he is a \"fraudulent hack\" is your opinion, and talk origins opinion. Talk origins is all about Darwinism, and since Hitching is anti Darwin, of course T.O. is going to try to discredit him. Their sources that they put forward as perfect, are the Royal Archaeological Institute, Stephen Jay Gould, and of course, Dawkins. An opinionated trio at best, and a trio that many would also consider fraudulent hacks. \n \n This was his only reference to Hitching;\n \nThe new biology is looking afresh at living things -- at their shapes, their patterns, their dynamics and their relationships. If, after more than a century, natural selection has been tested and found wanting, and if we are left once again with a sense of ignorance about origins, Darwin would not have minded. Science is a voyage of discovery, and beyond each horizon there is another. \n\n \n Can you dispute what he said here? Or is calling him a fraud the best you can do? It always amazes me, considering there is a fallacy called \"argument from authority\", that even when someone with other related credentials puts forward an opinion on basic evolutionary philosophy, that he is disregarded because he has no extensive biology degree. Wouldn't this be \"argument from LACK of authority\"? Why isn't it just as much of a fallacy? \n \n \n \n11. If astronomy hasn't made any conclusions about the origin of the universe, it's not science, but as soon as astronomers have enough information to make hypotheses about how the universe might have come about, the discipline of astronomy becomes a religion? More numbskullery. \n\n \n He didn't claim astronomy was a religion. You made another straw man! emoticon_xdonno \n \n \n \n12. Where the hell does evolutionary theory say anything about salvation? \n\n \n As he said, the promotion of science to \"reform society to eliminate social ills.\" As he said \"The humanist salvation represents a continuing process with neverending possibilities drawing inspiration from Darwin.\"\n \n It implies a salvation here on earth. If we let Darwinists / science run our lives, we will achieve a heaven on earth. The first step is to turn that big giant earth thermostat over to Al Gore. \n \n \n \n13. If evolution were unfalsifiable, why do creationists keep forwarding arguments about radiocarbon dating and radiohaloes and arguing that evolution is falsified? \n\n \n For the same reason that if the supernatural is unfalsifiable, atheists and evolutionists constantly keep forwarding arguments claiming that the supernatural doesn't exist, or isn't necessary. Again though, it depends on the definition for evolution on any given week. \n \n \n14. Why would the fact that evolution has support from \"so numerous\" an amount of disciplines, experiments, observations, etc., be something that works against evolutionary theory? This is just more dipshittery. \n\n \n True evolution has been corrupted by philosophical diciplines.\n \n \n15. In what way does this author's entire ignorance-laced, self-contradictory diatribe amount to anything more than a slew of false accusations, misrepresentations, and incredibly weak alleged connections?\n\n \n Many ways of course, but mainly his quotes from Julian Huxley and Ian Barbor, which made his points for him beautifully. But this paragraph probably says it best;\n \n \n2. There is an aspect of the religion that causes its adherents to be biased toward that religion. This is because the religion speaks to needs such as the desire to know where humans and the universe came from, what their obligations are, and how they are to be saved. This bias comes about because the religion answers these questions and those answers are appealing to the believers. Religions \"explain\" reality and believers of religions find it difficult to leave their religions because of the emotional attachment to them. This is different, certainly, from the traditional view of the scientist who is undogmatic and not attached to any religious view of reality. \n\n \n \n Darwinists are obviously biased towards that belief. It is appealing to them, as prominent evolutionists like Barbor, Huxley, Dawkins and many others constantly make clear. A questioning of it makes them emotional, as you have been in this post. You have not been \"undogmatic\". The above mentioned prominent evoltionists aren't either. This \"undogmaticness\" has spread throughout evolution, to the point of infesting science classrooms.",

Does that mean that physics is biased against you, or lunch, or yesterday? Does science take a statement made by a religious person and immediately throw it out because of its source? \n\n \n THE ACLU DOES! It uses science in the courts. \n \n \nScience is acceptable to many people of faith, including your favorite Catholic in the world, Kenneth Miller. The mere existence of theistic evolutionists bucks your assertion.

   "Where did I say it was the best I could do?\n\n Let's recap:They [atheism and science] shouldn't be equal, but they have been made equal. They are equal on discussion boards such as these, they are equal in most universities, and they are equal in the recent slew of publications by Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, and many others. [bold added]\n\n \nPlease provide quotes where Hitchens and Dawkins equate atheism and science.\n\n \nThey inspire it in their readers, and it's quite obvious by what is being done in science today, that it's very successful. Here is a good read on it;\n \n http://webpages.charter.net/jeffstueber/evolrel.htm\n \n Why don't you (and 10 or 20 more of your gang, if necessary) run through this, and I'll try to answer any questions that you may have.\nI challenged you to show me where Hitchens and Dawkins equate atheism and science. You gave me this nonsense, where some scientifically illiterate schmo with a webpage tries to make the case that evolution is a religion. This is not what I asked for, marc. Why didn't you provide what I asked for?\n \n \nI'm being cautious - I can't give away future secrets.\n\n You refuse to support your point unless it's in a formal debate? Is that the way we want to be? I could claim that you sexually violate chickens and refuse to support my assertion unless you challenge me to a formal debate on it; why would anybody believe me?\n \n \nDepending on how it's defined at any given time, it also attempts to explain \"biological reasons for human behavior\".\n\n How is the development of human behavior anything but a subset of the change of life, which I said evolution is?\n \n \nI'm sorry - this would be a fallicious question. (did I spell that right?) :p \n\n Perhaps, but it demands an answer. His page is riddled with lies, deception, and utter ignorance of science and scientific claims. Why are we expected to agree with the conclusions that he draws from false information?\n \n \nLike myself, he probably realizes that evolution has many definitions.\n\n Only when talking to anti-evolutionists. Ask any evolutionary biologist, and you'll get the same idea: the change in allele frequencies over time, which is the change of life over time.\n \n \nIt's the definitions thing - evolution should not be a religion, but it has been taken to that level. A small handful of theistic evolutionists attempt to keep evolution in its narrow, secular realm. Most theistic evolutionists are simply phonies. The ONLY WAY to recognize a sincere theistic evolutionist would be to see one take serious exception to most claims by the phony theistic evolutionists. (those who completely harmonize with atheists) I'm still waiting for that to happen on 4forums for the first time also.\n\n So it's the no-true-Scotsman fallacy coupled with the EAC, and your continued slander of theistic evolutionists. Keep going, marc; you're doing more damage to your position that I could here.\n \n \nNo because geometry isn't involved in social decisions\n\n Missed the train, huh? Trying to put down a Manifesto for being biased is nonsensical. Of course it's biased: it's a manifesto! What doesn't make sense is how the Humanist Manifesto shows that evolution is a religion.\n \n \nEvolutionary thought is largely about purposelessness\n\n No, it doesn't. Dawkins repeated speaks out against this mischaracterization. You, marc, oh holier-than-thou opponent of evolution, are of the only ilk that makes this claim. Considering you and your ilk generally know very little about evolution, why would we take your word over Dawkins's?\n \n \nNo, because sports are not used to make political decisions concerning purpose and morality.\n\n Please show me somebody who uses evolution as the basis to make \"political decisions concerning purpose and morality.\" Until you do, I'm calling shenanigans.\n \n \nBeing a passionate sports fan does not fit his somewhat extensive criteria for being a religion.\n\n The only thing it doesn't fit is his criterion of origins. Why don't we just cut through the bunk and address whether the origins criterion is the only one that matters?\n \n \nHe didn't claim socialism was a religion (you made a straw man emoticon_wow )\n\n I wasn't making a strawman, marc, I was pointing out a strawman. The author tried to draw a parallel between evolution and socialism in trying to show that evolution is a religion, but socialism is not a religion. How does arguing that evolution is like something that isn't a religion support the idea that evolution is a religion?\n \n \nIf evolution claims we're here because of undirected natural events, (as does atheism)\n\n Atheism makes no such claim. You are either lying or ignorant of what atheism says. Take your pick.\n \n \nthen humans are the highest form of intelligence on earth,\n\n Is this disputed? Creationists make this claim, too.\n \n \nand only certain humans are capable of knowing what is best for everyone.\n\n One might argue that even humans don't know what is best for everyone. But this is in no way supporting the idea that there must be a higher intelligence that does.\n \n \nHistory bears it out - atheism and personal liberty haven't gone together in past societies.\n\n And Christianity has a nice track record? Crusades, marc? Inquisition? Holocaust? Your lies are asinine.\n \n \nAgain I believe we have another fallacy, that wasn't a question, it was a vulgar taunt. Is that the best you can do?\n\n I gave you fifteen questions. You haven't given a satisfactory answer yet. The absolute absurdity of this guys arguments is stunning and perfectly deserving of unabashed taunting.\n \n \nThey [Dawkins and Miller] both constantly try to pass off Darwin's original statements as accurate representations of modern theory. You didn't know that?\n\n I know that they still use some of Darwin's statements if they are still accurate. This guy takes any statement and insists that it's the modern interpretation of facts that were discovered over a century after his death. This author guy is simply a shameless shill; why can't you see this? \n \n \nTheir sources that they put forward as perfect, are the Royal Archaeological Institute, Stephen Jay Gould, and of course, Dawkins. An opinionated trio at best, and a trio that many would also consider fraudulent hacks.\n\n BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! That's hilarious, marc. The reason somebody contacted these three sources is because Hitching himself claimed association with them as reliable sources! AAHHHHHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\n To add insult to injury, Hitching's own sources discredit him. Can you find any cases of any practicing scientists discrediting Gould or Dawkins, or attacking the Royal Archaeological Institute, for crying out loud? Hitching was nailed for lying, so we get to label him as a fraudulent, and he doesn't know the material he claims to know, so we can label him a hack. Unless you can provide documentation to the effect, there is no reason to believe that Gould or Dawkins or the RAI are either fraudulent or hacks.\n \n \nCan you dispute what he said here? Or is calling him a fraud the best you can do?\n\n Unlike you, I can back up my claims. The RAI says that he is not a member, but he claimed membership in the RAI as a credential. This lie makes him fraudulent. He also promotes discredited young-earth arguments that have been rejected by sciences of countless disciplines.\n Hitching implied that natural selection has been tested and \"found wanting,\" but this is simply wrong. Natural selection has been observed repeatedly, the effects of natural selection can often be predicted, and natural selection explains a wide variety of changes. This numbskullery qualifies him as a hack.\n \n \nIt always amazes me, considering there is a fallacy called \"argument from authority\", that even when someone with other related credentials puts forward an opinion on basic evolutionary philosophy, that he is disregarded because he has no extensive biology degree.\n\n Would you let a physicist perform your appendectomy? Maybe I'll let a non-practicing geologist perform the DNA analysis from your daughter's SAE kit. You wouldn't mind the risk, since he's got a degree in a science, right?\n Here's what you missed even though I pointed it out for you: Hitching lied about his credentials and references. Don't get all pissy about disregarding somebody you think has credentials when it has been shown that he lied about them. Or maybe you're in the same boat as Archie and think that lying is okay as long as it's lying for Jesus?\n \n \nWouldn't this be \"argument from LACK of authority\"? Why isn't it just as much of a fallacy?\n\n That's what the fallacy is, marc. President Bush may be an authority figure, but it's pointless to use Bush as a source for the procedure for performing protein analysis. That's not his specialty. This would be a fallacious appeal to authority. However, if I were to ask a county sheriff about general police procedure, this would be a valid appeal to authority because the person being used as a source really is an authority on that subject.\n \n \nHe didn't claim astronomy was a religion. You made another straw man!\n\n It seems you purposely miss the train on these questions. I am exposing the flaws in his reasoning. I am saying that astronomy qualifies as a religion under his absurd criteria. Of course he doesn't claim that astronomy is a religion -- that would show how idiotic his argument is!\n \n \n \n12. Where the hell does evolutionary theory say anything about salvation?\nAs he said, the promotion of science to \"reform society to eliminate social ills.\" As he said \"The humanist salvation represents a continuing process with neverending possibilities drawing inspiration from Darwin.\"\n\n As your nutjob author said. I asked you where evolutionary theory says anything about salvation. Why the hell would I be listening to this guy about what evolutionary theory says when he has already produced lie after lie about evolution?\n \n \nIt implies a salvation here on earth. If we let Darwinists / science run our lives, we will achieve a heaven on earth.\n\n This might be a claim of some Humanists, but it's not a claim of evolution.\n \n \nFor the same reason that if the supernatural is unfalsifiable, atheists and evolutionists constantly keep forwarding arguments claiming that the supernatural doesn't exist, or isn't necessary.\n\n And you accuse me of shifting goalposts... Nobody is claiming that we have proved that God doesn't exist. Even your personal hero Dawkins doesn't promote the idea that anybody has disproved the existence of God. Disbelief does not imply proof of absence.\n \n \nAgain though, it depends on the definition for evolution on any given week.\n\n Listen, marcky marc, you're discussing this with me. I have consistently given you a single definition. It is completely stupid of you to insist that these anti-evolutionists have a better definition of evolution that practicing evolutionary biologists. I use the definition used by evolutionary biologists. So you can either quit behaving like a scared little child and address what I'm actually saying, or you can continue pretending that there's some terrible attempt to confuse you based on information that comes only from anti-evolutionists. The latter will result in my ripping you a new one each and every time you are so blatantly and willingly dishonest about evolutionist claims.\n \n \nTrue evolution has been corrupted by philosophical diciplines.\n\n I argue the science. How about we stick to the science? But you didn't even answer the question. The question was:14. Why would the fact that evolution has support from \"so numerous\" an amount of [scientific] disciplines, experiments, observations, etc., be something that works against evolutionary theory?\n \nBut this paragraph probably says it best; [snip quote about bias]\n\n His characterization of \"bias\" is erroneous. Am I \"biased\" that two added to two is four? I certainly firmly believe this to be true. Am I \"biased\" that if I throw a ball in the air, it will fall back to the ground? I firmly believe it to be true. The only thing that this paragraph says that isn't based on this silly criterion of bias is -- surprise! -- discussion of origins.",

   "Theoretical knowledge, to me, means we have a general idea about how to do it, even if we don't have the specific techniques figures out yet. Take cloning as an example. 20 years ago it was theoretically possible; just take DNA and stick it in an egg. Then, with alot of work, we actually did it. But creating life from scratch? We don't even have the beginning of a framework on how to do that. There's a big leap from \"not impossible\" to \"theoretically possible\". You may not need vitalistic breath, but clearly some trick is involved, and until we know what that trick is and have some idea about how to pull it off claiming that creating life is theoretically possible seems to be stretching truth in advertising to me. The \"trick\" could, to make up an example, be that you need extraordinarly precise concentrations of certain chemicals, specific radiation, and an exact temperature. A set of circumstances that's fairly likely to occur in the course of a few million years on something the size of a planet, but beyond our skill to replicate in a lab. At this point, we simply don't know.\n\n \n Well, I wouldn't necessarily call it a trick, unless assembling all the components in the correct sequence and relationship is a trick: e.g. start off with a protein/carbohydrate-stabilised lipid bilayer, then introduce the metabolically and structurally necessary chemicals, proteins, nucleic acids, etc. Easy to say it in theory, but technically difficult to pull off, of course. The point I was trying to make is that there is no vitalistic secret to life -- a general (if not yet complete) theory of how life works is well-established, and it is \"merely\" the \"correct\" assembly of molecules, which is performed automatically by cells because they have all the necessary bootstrapping protocols and scaffolding in place in a continuous sequence going back to the origin of the first living cell(s). \n \n Now, if you are trying to assemble a cell by some means other than natural development, obviously it's going to be much trickier, but maybe there are ways of growing a cell slowly in a non-natural way. It's \"just\" a matter of knowing what the minimal essentials are, and making sure every molecule ends up in the right place in the right orientation. (Considerable progress has been made using knockout experiments to try and obtain the \"minimal\" genome capable of sustaining modern microbial life.) \n \n It's true we don't yet know how to do it without using parts from existing living cells, but I see it as more of a technical issue than a fundamentally scientific one. Worse, I see no real advantage to perfecting the technical trick, as using natural methods with a few tweaks is probably always going to be easier and cheaper. I don't even think that perfecting such a technical trick would tell us much that is fundamental about life we don't already know.\n \n Still, I suspect that someone will eventually do it just to \"prove\" that it can be done. I just don't think such formal \"proof\" is really necessary to support the concept, and there are probably more useful ways of spending research dollars. Others will probably disagree.",

   "Let's recap:\n \n I challenged you to show me where Hitchens and Dawkins equate atheism and science. You gave me this nonsense, where some scientifically illiterate schmo with a webpage tries to make the case that evolution is a religion. This is not what I asked for, marc. Why didn't you provide what I asked for? \n\n \n I very thoroughly provided what you asked for - you just didn't like it. Past thinkers such as Julian Huxley and Ian Barbour have obviously provided inspiration for current atheists like Hitchens and Dawkins to equate atheism and science. It's simply common knowledge that they use science, coupled with their personal atheism, to ridicule religion. \n \n \n \nYou refuse to support your point unless it's in a formal debate? Is that the way we want to be? I could claim that you sexually violate chickens and refuse to support my assertion unless you challenge me to a formal debate on it; why would anybody believe me? \n\n \n They wouldn't, because practically no one believes that it would be common for a Christian to sexually violate chickens. The Bible suggests against this type of perversion. But again, it's common knowledge that authors like Hitchens and Dawkins use science to promote atheism. To what degree everyone knows it is another story of course. The question is, is it done to a degree that it enters the political arena to the extent that it violates the first amendments establishment clause? Example; Is \"The Blind Watchmaker\" ever required reading in publicly funded schools? \n \n \n \nHow is the development of human behavior anything but a subset of the change of life, which I said evolution is? \n\n \n An excellent question, it isn't, therefore it can and does enter politics as fact, when there is often controversy about how factual it is at any given time or circumstance. \n \n \nPerhaps, but it demands an answer. His page is riddled with lies, deception, and utter ignorance of science and scientific claims. Why are we expected to agree with the conclusions that he draws from false information?\n\n \n The same reason that many agree with atheistic conclusions of authors like Richard Dawkins. \n \n \nOnly when talking to anti-evolutionists. \n\n \n Thank you - that's it!! When evolutionists are talking to anti evolutionists, they switch the definition around to match what they're trying to argue. If the ACLU is using Dawkins books to argue that religion is some mysterious quirk of evolution, to be equated with some type of mental retardation, then evolution is a very broad subject. If called on it as allowed by the US political process, then suddenly evolution becomes the very narrow, very boring \"change in allele frequencies over time\". \n \n \n \nAsk any evolutionary biologist, and you'll get the same idea: the change in allele frequencies over time, which is the change of life over time.\n\n \n That's what happens often too late, AFTER the ACLU wins their court case, with the previous broad decision. They're called on their philosophical, broad decision, and quickly revert back to the boring one. \n \n \n \nSo it's the no-true-Scotsman fallacy coupled with the EAC, and your continued slander of theistic evolutionists. Keep going, marc; you're doing more damage to your position that I could here. \n\n \n No-true-Scotsman - I haven't heard of that one. Could you explain it to me? Maybe it will help you ~change the subject~, another \"fallacy\". \n \n \nMissed the train, huh? Trying to put down a Manifesto for being biased is nonsensical. Of course it's biased: it's a manifesto! What doesn't make sense is how the Humanist Manifesto shows that evolution is a religion.\n\n \n Speaking of missing the train - I put it down because it can be INVOLVED IN SOCIAL DECISIONS, and it opens the door for first amendment establishment clause violations if it's claimed to be factual science. \n \n \nNo, it doesn't. Dawkins repeated speaks out against this mischaracterization. \n\n \n Where does he do that? In his book called \"The BLIND watchmaker\"? Or does he do it somewhere else, and contradict his blind watchmaker book? Do you think there's a chance that he uses the word \"blind\" as to equate it to purposelessness? If you don't what do you think the word \"blind\" as he uses it, actually means? \n \n \n \n You, marc, oh holier-than-thou opponent of evolution, are of the only ilk that makes this claim. Considering you and your ilk generally know very little about evolution, why would we take your word over Dawkins's? \n\n \n Because it's not required to have a degree in evolution to see much of how it is philosophically applied in politics. It's a Christian thing. You know - free speech and government by the people, not calling religious people names and making people like Dawkins authorities in education. \n \n \n \nPlease show me somebody who uses evolution as the basis to make \"political decisions concerning purpose and morality.\" Until you do, I'm calling shenanigans. \n\n \n http://atheism.about.com/library/FAQs/evo/blevo_law.htm\n \n \nEvolution is perhaps the only area of science which has been transformed into a legal issue on which courts around the country have had to render decisions. No one initiates lawsuits over the teaching of gravity, physics, chemistry, or any other part of the science curriculum. It's also highly unlikely to find heated legislative debates over the status of such topics in public schools, and that makes evolution relatively unusual. \n\n \n \n Remember the Terry Schiavo case? Evolution may not have been directly used, but it was involved. The philosophy of purposlessness is involved in things like abortion, death penalty, gay marriage etc also. \n \n \nThe only thing it doesn't fit is his criterion of origins. Why don't we just cut through the bunk and address whether the origins criterion is the only one that matters? \n\n \n Cut through the bunk? Abandon 90% of the debate? Are you depressed that you don't have any helpers here? I am too - I'm thinking about starting another thread on that link - this one, a derailed one 200 + posts deep, may not be getting the attention it needs. Maybe later in the week - I'm quite busy, and you need time to cool. \n \n \nI wasn't making a strawman, marc, I was pointing out a strawman. The author tried to draw a parallel between evolution and socialism in trying to show that evolution is a religion, but socialism is not a religion. How does arguing that evolution is like something that isn't a religion support the idea that evolution is a religion? \n\n \n The EXACT SAME WAY that criterion used in ID, which isn't a religion, is claimed to be religion, by evolutionists! William Dembski says it best;\n \n \n\"Critics of ID resort to a classic defense mechanism; they project onto ID the very thing that ID unmasks in their own views, namely that Darwinism, especially as it has been taken up by today's intellectual elite, has itself become a project in theology.\" \n\n \n \nAtheism makes no such claim. You are either lying or ignorant of what atheism says. Take your pick. \n\n \n Atheism says \"There is no god\" We had to get here either with or without a God. If there is no god, who did the directing? Please don't say \"nature\" - nature does not have a mind, and it does not have a purpose. So it does not \"direct\" any differently in evolution, than it does in atheism. \n \n \nAnd Christianity has a nice track record? Crusades, marc? Inquisition? Holocaust? Your lies are asinine. \n\n \n Christianity has a far better track record than atheism. Joseph Stalin?\n \n \nI gave you fifteen questions. You haven't given a satisfactory answer yet. The absolute absurdity of this guys arguments is stunning and perfectly deserving of unabashed taunting. \n\n \n Does Dembski's statement above deserve unabashed taunting too? Would it not be better to make a logical argument against it? Is taunting secondary to making a logical argument, or does taunting come first with evolutionists? How many brilliant breakthroughs about natural selection have come about by taunting anyone who asks questions into silence? \n \n \n \nI know that they still use some of Darwin's statements if they are still accurate. This guy takes any statement and insists that it's the modern interpretation of facts that were discovered over a century after his death. This author guy is simply a shameless shill; why can't you see this? \n\n \n Your generalizations and name calling tell me that he may be onto more than even I thought. It was an old bookmark I had - I don't even remember when or why I found it. \n \n \nBAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! That's hilarious, marc. The reason somebody contacted these three sources is because Hitching himself claimed association with them as reliable sources! AAHHHHHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\n\n \n Maybe they were associated (united) at one time, and there was a conflict. Maybe those three sources suddenly saw a threat in Hitching, and are now lying about any past association. I know the reason that you can't phantom any of your trusted evolutionary sources as liars, is because you have developed a trust in them conparable to the trust I have in the Bible. It's a religion thing don't-cha-know.\n \n \nTo add insult to injury, Hitching's own sources discredit him. Can you find any cases of any practicing scientists discrediting Gould or Dawkins, or attacking the Royal Archaeological Institute, for crying out loud? Hitching was nailed for lying, so we get to label him as a fraudulent, and he doesn't know the material he claims to know, so we can label him a hack. Unless you can provide documentation to the effect, there is no reason to believe that Gould or Dawkins or the RAI are either fraudulent or hacks. \n\n \n The only ones who \"nailed\" him for lying were evolutionists! Unless you can provide much more evidence that Hitching lied (particularly in the quote from my link since it's the only thing relevant here) then there is no reason to believe that he is either fraudulent or a hack concerning this discussion. \n \n It really is possible for someone besides a practicing scientist to discredit Gould or Dawkins in a truthful way. Practicing scientists aren't supreme beings. (unless you are a member of the evolutionist religion)\n \n \nUnlike you, I can back up my claims. The RAI says that he is not a member, but he claimed membership in the RAI as a credential. This lie makes him fraudulent. He also promotes discredited young-earth arguments that have been rejected by sciences of countless disciplines.\n Hitching implied that natural selection has been tested and \"found wanting,\" but this is simply wrong. Natural selection has been observed repeatedly, the effects of natural selection can often be predicted, and natural selection explains a wide variety of changes. This numbskullery qualifies him as a hack.\n\n \n So anyone who questions Darwinian natural selection is a hack? Is this determined by logic, or is it determined by taunts?\n \n \n \nWould you let a physicist perform your appendectomy? Maybe I'll let a non-practicing geologist perform the DNA analysis from your daughter's SAE kit. You wouldn't mind the risk, since he's got a degree in a science, right? \n\n \n You're confusing hard sciences with philosophy. Science isn't the only source of knowledge. I wouldn't let Democrat scientists (or Democrat economists) manage my money for me, for example. \n \n \nHere's what you missed even though I pointed it out for you: Hitching lied about his credentials and references. Don't get all pissy about disregarding somebody you think has credentials when it has been shown that he lied about them. Or maybe you're in the same boat as Archie and think that lying is okay as long as it's lying for Jesus? \n\n \n That has little to do with the link I posted, and what that link claims overall. You've tried to go off on largely unrelated tangents several times here. \n \n \nThat's what the fallacy is, marc. President Bush may be an authority figure, but it's pointless to use Bush as a source for the procedure for performing protein analysis. That's not his specialty. This would be a fallacious appeal to authority. However, if I were to ask a county sheriff about general police procedure, this would be a valid appeal to authority because the person being used as a source really is an authority on that subject. \n\n \n Okay, I get it - argument from authority is okay as long as it's the politically correct authority. Do all proper authorities have to come from largely atheist universities? If a county sheriff were a Christian, would he be as good an authority as an evolutionist politician with a college degree, who studied natural selection traits on criminals brains? \n \n \nIt seems you purposely miss the train on these questions. I am exposing the flaws in his reasoning. I am saying that astronomy qualifies as a religion under his absurd criteria. Of course he doesn't claim that astronomy is a religion -- that would show how idiotic his argument is! \n\n \n Almost as idiotic as claiming ID is a religion, isn't it? Evolutionists double standards know no bounds. \n \n \n \nAs your nutjob author said. I asked you where evolutionary theory says anything about salvation. Why the hell would I be listening to this guy about what evolutionary theory says when he has already produced lie after lie about evolution? \n\n \n He hasn't produced lie after lie about evolution, he has EXPOSED lie after lie about evolution, and that's why you're so angry. \n \n \nThis might be a claim of some Humanists, but it's not a claim of evolution.\n\n \n It can be, if ~evolution definition switcharoo~ is deployed. \n \n \nAnd you accuse me of shifting goalposts... Nobody is claiming that we have proved that God doesn't exist. Even your personal hero Dawkins doesn't promote the idea that anybody has disproved the existence of God. Disbelief does not imply proof of absence. \n\n \n He's not my hero, I think he's a fraudulent hack. I do research things, however briefly, before making such determinations - I do have a copy of The Blind Watchmaker. You obviously don't have one, do you plan on getting it? \n \n \nListen, marcky marc, you're discussing this with me. I have consistently given you a single definition. It is completely stupid of you to insist that these anti-evolutionists have a better definition of evolution that practicing evolutionary biologists. I use the definition used by evolutionary biologists. \n\n \n It is equally stupid of you to wink, nod, and take no exception when the ACLU uses philosophical definitions of evolution that aren't openly put forward by practicing evolutionary biologists, in court cases that try to destroy religion in the US, and think no one will notice. \n \n \n \n So you can either quit behaving like a scared little child and address what I'm actually saying, or you can continue pretending that there's some terrible attempt to confuse you based on information that comes only from anti-evolutionists. The latter will result in my ripping you a new one each and every time you are so blatantly and willingly dishonest about evolutionist claims. \n\n \n \n When you get your copy of The Blind Watchmaker, please turn to page 408. Read this evolutionary biologists statement very carefully;\n \n \nIf a form of life is ever discovered in another part of the universe, however outlandish and weirdly alien that form of life may be in detail, it will be found to resemble life on earth in one key respect: it will have evolved by some kind of Darwinian natural selection.\n\n \n An evolutionary biologist has just informed us that Darwin rules the universe!! Is that a fact, or is that religion? Does it violate the first amendment to teach this in schools?\n \n Okay, you may now rip me a new one for copying something from Dawkins book. \n \n \n \nI argue the science. How about we stick to the science? \n\n \n \n You argue it like this?\n \nI could claim that you sexually violate chickens...\n The absolute absurdity of this guys arguments is stunning and perfectly deserving of unabashed taunting....\n BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!.....\n Listen, marcky marc \n\n \n Very impressive how you argue science. Are your arguments science, or are they anger? When Dawkins argues it with his above statement, that Darwinism is as all-encompassing as God is stated to be in the Bible, is it really science, or is it religion?",

   "I very thoroughly provided what you asked for\n\n No you didn't. How do quotes from Julian Huxley and Barbour that say nothing about Dawkins or Hitchens or anything that Dawkins or Hitchens says have anything to do with backing up your assertions about Dawkins and Hitchens? The truth is that you've supplied no argumentation for your assertion.\n \n \nPast thinkers such as Julian Huxley and Ian Barbour have obviously provided inspiration for current atheists like Hitchens and Dawkins to equate atheism and science. It's simply common knowledge that they use science, coupled with their personal atheism, to ridicule religion.\n\n All you can seem to do is simply baldly repeat yourself as if that's all it takes. \"Ohh, but everyone knows that this is true!\" \"It's so obvious!\" \"See, it's common knowledge\" that I don't have to support! Get real. You're lying, you can't back up your points, and you don't even care. More lying for Jesus, huh marc?\n \n \nThey wouldn't, because practically no one believes that it would be common for a Christian to sexually violate chickens.\n\n So you make your conclusion based on what you already know. But you haven't shown me any reason for believing these things about Dawkins and Hitchens. Why can't I call you a chicken violator because, well, I know that people who go by the name \"marc\" are chicken violators? Nobody believes me because I have no evidence, and neither do you.\n \n \nThe Bible suggests against this type of perversion.\n\n In Genesis, God parades animals in front of Adam so that he can pick his mate. How is this suggesting against beastiality?\n \n \nThe question is, is it done to a degree that it enters the political arena to the extent that it violates the first amendments establishment clause? Example; Is \"The Blind Watchmaker\" ever required reading in publicly funded schools?\n\n If it's required reading in any schools, it's not as promotion of atheism. You still haven't shown that the book does promote atheism. Moreover, considering the slew of \"Bible as literature\" courses that are being taught, you really are in no position to complain.\n \n \nAn excellent question, it isn't, therefore it can and does enter politics as fact, when there is often controversy about how factual it is at any given time or circumstance.\n\n Show me any instance where the cognitive evolution of humans has explicitly played any role in American politics.\n \n \nWhy are we expected to agree with the conclusions that he draws from false information?\nThe same reason that many agree with atheistic conclusions of authors like Richard Dawkins.\n\n This doesn't really answer the question. Are you insinuating that Dawkins uses false information to come to his conclusions? If so, please show us the information and show support for your assertion that it is false.\n \n \nOnly when talking to anti-evolutionists.\nThank you - that's it!! When evolutionists are talking to anti evolutionists, they switch the definition around to match what they're trying to argue.\n\n Nice one, marc. Complete ignorance of context and previous statements. I was saying that you will only get varying definitions of evolution from anti-evolutionists. But you don't recognize this, either because you have non-existent short term memory or because of selective amnesia. Here's a reminder:Listen, marcky marc, you're discussing this with me. I have consistently given you a single definition. It is completely stupid of you to insist that these anti-evolutionists have a better definition of evolution [than] practicing evolutionary biologists. I use the definition used by evolutionary biologists. So you can either quit behaving like a scared little child and address what I'm actually saying, or you can continue pretending that there's some terrible attempt to confuse you based on information that comes only from anti-evolutionists.\nSo, you can continue with your phony persecution pity party, or you can join the real world and pay attention to what I say. Of course you won't add me to your ignore list; you ignore what I say already.\n \n \nIf the ACLU is using Dawkins books to argue that religion is some mysterious quirk of evolution, to be equated with some type of mental retardation,\n\n And if you're too busy having wonderful sexy fun with those chickens...\n You see, marc, you don't just get to make things up and pass them off as accurate. Can you show where the ACLU is arguing that religion should be equated with mental retardation? No? So you're just a liar?\n \n \nThat's what happens often too late, AFTER the ACLU wins their court case, with the previous broad decision.\n\n Only \"AFTER,\" you say? Okay then, feel free to pore over the trial transcripts from McLean, Epperson, Edwards, and Kitzmiller and find all of the claims of the evolutionists that evolution is anything more than I said. If this alleged switch only happens \"after\" the decision, then \"BEFORE\" the decision should be support for your accusations. Provide them.\n \n \nNo-true-Scotsman - I haven't heard of that one. Could you explain it to me? Maybe it will help you ~change the subject~, another \"fallacy\".\n\n Your ignorance of fallacies is not a fallacy on my part. Here's a primer on no-true-Scotsman.\n \n \nI put it down because it can be INVOLVED IN SOCIAL DECISIONS,\n\n \"SOCIAL\" decisions? marc, your Freudian slip is showing. Social decisions aren't affected by the establishment clause. I can make all the social decisions I want based on my religion (or rather, non-religion), your religion, my neighbor's religion, whatever, and it isn't restricted by the establishment clause. What you meant was political decisions, but that still doesn't follow. Economics is part of political decisions; does that make it a religion? If Bush favors the trickle-down model of economics, does that bias amount to a violation of the Constitution? \n \n \nand it opens the door for first amendment establishment clause violations if it's claimed to be factual science.\n\n You seriously need to learn about the establishment clause. Try looking up the Lemon case and the resulting Lemon Test. Using a Dawkins book to teach science, unless it was selected for the purpose of promoting atheism or has the primary effect of promoting atheism, is not a violation.\n \n \nDo you think there's a chance that he uses the word \"blind\" as to equate it to purposelessness? If you don't what do you think the word \"blind\" as he uses it, actually means?\n\n Personally, I haven't read the book, so anything I say is mere speculation. I think that your trying to derive some sort of incredibly meaningful message from that single adjective is no less silly than arguing that because Dawkins used a noun -- Watchmaker -- that he's really a theist in describe and was referring to the Christian God. Or maybe he's a JW and secretly honoring The Watchtower. My guess would be that he is arguing that evolution has no religious teleology.\n \n \nBecause it's not required to have a degree in evolution to see much of how it is philosophically applied in politics.\n\n But you haven't done that, marc. All you've done is stomp and rant and rave and blow steam from your ears and nose that this is going on without one iota of actual support of your blustering. How about you get around to that?\n \n \nIt's a Christian thing. You know - free speech and government by the people\n\n Gee, marc, if you really, truly have such terrible memory problems, let me know and I'll stop making fun of them. Meanwhile, let me remind you that I slaughtered you in our debate using these arguments. Terrible incompetence? unparalleled incomprehension? memory recall deficiencies? Which one of these is it?\n \n \nPlease show me somebody who uses evolution as the basis to make \"political decisions concerning purpose and morality.\" Until you do, I'm calling shenanigans.\nhttp://atheism.about.com/library/FAQs/evo/blevo_law.htm\n\n Swing and a miss. I already listed the court cases: which one makes political decisions concerning purpose and morality, marc? Name them. I dare you. Find me any law that promotes evolution as some determining factor in purpose and morality. Do it.\n \n \nEvolution may not have been directly used, but it was involved. The philosophy of purposlessness is involved in things like abortion, death penalty, gay marriage etc also.\n\n SHOW THE EVIDENCE, chickenlover. (This is, by the way, what I'll be calling you every time you tell another lie and fail to back it up.)\n \n \nCut through the bunk? Abandon 90% of the debate?\n\n I'm leaning toward severe comprehension problems.\n I'm saying that we should focus the debate on the criterion that seems to be the only one that matters, not that we abandon everything else altogether.\n \n \nHow does arguing that evolution is like something that isn't a religion support the idea that evolution is a religion?\nThe EXACT SAME WAY that criterion used in ID, which isn't a religion, is claimed to be religion\n\n This doesn't answer the question at all. (Comprehension problems seems the likely culprit at this point.) Even if we assume that Dembski isn't full of spit -- which is a terrible assumption given the evidence to the contrary -- many evolutionists argue that ID is a religion, and many IDists argue that evolution is a religion. How does arguing that evolution is like [b]something that isn't a religion support the argument that evolution is a religion?\n \n \nIf there is no god, who did the directing? Please don't say \"nature\" - nature does not have a mind, and it does not have a purpose.\n\n Evolution is undirected. Period.\n \n \nSo it does not \"direct\" any differently in evolution, than it does in atheism.\n\n If there is no God, what makes things fall? Please don't say gravity, because gravity does not have a mind, and it does not have a purpose. Either way, things do not fall any differently in gravity than they do in atheism.\n So, using marc's reasoning, gravity is atheistic. We can do the same with countless other examples, and we can do it using philosophies other than atheism. Two plus two equals four exactly the same in math class as it does in your church, therefore math is an intrusion of Christianity into the classroom and is a violation of the Constitution.\n marc, we can parody your balderdash all day long. And, just so you're clear, parody is a valid form of counterargument.",

   "Christianity has a far better track record than atheism. Joseph Stalin?\n\n Hitler? Every last wave of Crusaders? The Inquisition? But the question is not actually about track record, it's about causal tendencies. And while you may think that puts you in the better position, none of history, none of the research, and none of the logic supports your position. (Shall I remind you that the ratio of atheists in the U.S public to atheists in U.S. prisons is 10:1?)\n \n \nDoes Dembski's statement above deserve unabashed taunting too?\n\n Most likely. I don't see any support for his assertions. But I'll give him the benefit of the doubt that there was actually more to what he wrote than just your excerpt. No, Dembski's work is deserving of unabashed rending even in its entirety.\n \n \nIs taunting secondary to making a logical argument, or does taunting come first with evolutionists?\n\n I've been kicking your XXX on the subject matter for much longer than I've been ridiculing your indefensible positions. The reason you don't realize this remains one of the great mysteries of 4forums.\n By the way, if you're interested in seeing Dembski's work ripped to shreds, just head over to Panda's Thumb and do a search for his name.\n \n \nHow many brilliant breakthroughs about natural selection have come about by taunting anyone who asks questions into silence? \n\n Natural selection has nothing to do with taunting. Natural selection is simply what happens. Nobody is trying to taunt anybody into silence, only trying to argue for truth. If some people decide to shut up with their lying and ignorant babbling because they're tired of getting their asses kicked in the evolution debate, though, I can't say I'm crushed.\n Tell me, marc, how many brilliant breakthroughs have IDists come up with... you know, ever, about anything?\n \n \nhe may be onto more than even I thought.\n\n Based on the fact that he's lying about what is being said about evolution these days? But fine, insist that you're right; of course, then you'll have to actually support the accusation that statements from Darwin that are now known to be false are now presented as true. Are you able to do that, chickenlover?\n \n \nMaybe they were associated (united) at one time, and there was a conflict. Maybe those three sources suddenly saw a threat in Hitching, and are now lying about any past association.\n\n Right, the EAC. Do you have any support for this conspiracy, chickenlover?\n \n \nThe only ones who \"nailed\" him for lying were evolutionists! Unless you can provide much more evidence that Hitching lied (particularly in the quote from my link since it's the only thing relevant here) then there is no reason to believe that he is either fraudulent or a hack concerning this discussion.\n\n I laughed loudly at you, and you still didn't see the irony of your position. Let me try again, and I'll type slowly and use small words for you, marc.\n Your source said that Hitching is an authority on the subject. Hitching said that he is a reliable authority because he is a member of the Royal Archaelogical Institute. The RAI says that Hitching is not a member. Your argument is that the Royal Archaeological Institute is a bunch of liars.\n Do you see the paradox? Either the RAI is a respectable organization, and Hitching was not a member, or the RAI is not the least bit respectable, and Hitching is a member. Again, you just take your pick.\n Nothing says that I can only use your source. Such an argument is asinine. I'll challenge you to a two round debate right now if one of the stipulations is that you can only use me or my links as sources.\n \n \nIt really is possible for someone besides a practicing scientist to discredit Gould or Dawkins in a truthful way.\n\n I'm sure it is. But it's incredibly unlikely. If what Gould or Dawkins has claimed to be true is really contradicted by the evidence, then we would expect this news to come from somebody who actually works with the evidence, not somebody who knows nothing of evolution or someone who has to lie about his accreditations.\n \n \nSo anyone who questions Darwinian natural selection is a hack? Is this determined by logic, or is it determined by taunts?\n\n It's determined by the fact that he is making statements that he cannot back up and promoting them as truth. (You could say that makes him similar to a chickenlover.)\n \n \nYou're confusing hard sciences with philosophy.\n\n If you care to go back and look, marc, you are the one who brought in philosophy. And you're doing it again here instead of addressing my questions. Would you let a physicist do your appendectomy? No, you wouldn't, because surgery is not his field of study. You know damn well that scientists study to become experts in particular fields and not experts in every single scientific discipline, yet you want us to take the word of somebody speaking on a topic far outside his specialty merely because you want to classify him as a scientist. Numbskullery at its finest, marc.\n \n \nI wouldn't let Democrat scientists (or Democrat economists) manage my money for me, for example. \n\n But that's not what's at issue. The issue is whether you'd let a highly qualified surgeon who happens to be a Democrat do your surgery, and -- if not -- whether you rejected him as your surgeon for his political party or for his medical specialty.\n \n \nThat has little to do with the link I posted, and what that link claims overall. You've tried to go off on largely unrelated tangents several times here.\n\n You've lied several times, and here is no exception. I have addressed the credibility of your author's sources. It has everything to do with the link.\n \n \nOkay, I get it - argument from authority is okay as long as it's the politically correct authority.\n\n Another lie. (Either you don't get it, or you do get it and are pretending that I've said what I haven't.) An argument from authority is not a fallacy if it is a proper authority. For example, I would not be an authority on what it's like to be involved in a church community after going to church at least once a week for several years, and this is because I have neither done this myself nor spent time studying the experience of people who have. You, if you have been going to church for several years and are active in your church community, would be an authority on the subject. Appealing to my explanation would be a fallacy; appealing to yours would not.\n \n \nIf a county sheriff were a Christian, would he be as good an authority as an evolutionist politician with a college degree, who studied natural selection traits on criminals brains?\n\n Did either of them study abnormal/criminal psychology while getting their degrees in biology? Their labels, positions, and titles don't matter unless it's that position or the earning of that label or title that has given them the experience that qualifies them.\n Rant all you want, marc, but as I said earlier, your ignorance of fallacies is really no harm to my position.\n \n \n \nAlmost as idiotic as claiming ID is a religion, isn't it? Evolutionists double standards know no bounds.\n\n Ah, but ID does fit the standards that your author tries to apply! How can you possibly say that ID isn't a religion if it passes this test you so want to apply to evolution? ID also has an overtly religious background and motivation. And for you to say that evolutionists have a double standard here... well, let's just say that you wouldn't know an iron if it hit you in the face.\n \n \nHe hasn't produced lie after lie about evolution, he has EXPOSED lie after lie about evolution, and that's why you're so angry. \n\n What statements from his page about evolution that I'm calling lies are actually true? Can you provide evidence that they're actually true, chickenlover? I get angry when you lie, and then call me a liar for nailing you on it.\n I'll give you a topic: your author tries to argue that natural selection actually has been found lacking, and that therefore evolution as a whole is thrown into doubt. Please explain where natural selection has failed to explain our observations, and where other aspects of evolution -- such as genetic drift, gene flow, sexual selection, exaptation, etc -- give us any reason to doubt that evolutionary theory is correct.\n \n \nThis might be a claim of some Humanists, but it's not a claim of evolution.\nIt can be, if ~evolution definition switcharoo~ is deployed.\n\n You pulled a switcharoo, marc; nobody else did. You tried to describe a Humanist position as evolutionistic, and I called you on it. Now you're trying to blame me.\n Do you always lie like this, marc? Pretend that you haven't equivocated and then pretend that I've tried to pull the wool over your eyes? Is this the kind of dishonesty that God asks of his followers? I'm sure that your pastor is always telling everybody at your church that it's bad to lie -- but that lying for Jesus is encouraged! Right?\n Why should I continue responding to you if all you do is lie about whatever you can spin and ignore everything else?\n \n \n[Dawkins is] not my hero, I think he's a fraudulent hack.\n\n I know, but you haven't countered a single position that he holds with any sort of evidence. Do you plan on doing that anytime soon?\n \n \nthe ACLU uses philosophical definitions of evolution that aren't openly put forward by practicing evolutionary biologists, in court cases that try to destroy religion in the US, and think no one will notice.\n\n Do you have any evidence of this, chickenlover?\n \n \nWhen you get your copy of The Blind Watchmaker, please turn to page 408. Read this evolutionary biologists statement very carefully;\nIf a form of life is ever discovered in another part of the universe, however outlandish and weirdly alien that form of life may be in detail, it will be found to resemble life on earth in one key respect: it will have evolved by some kind of Darwinian natural selection.\nAn evolutionary biologist has just informed us that Darwin rules the universe!!\n\n You have some serious problems with reading comprehension or a persecution complex, but probably both. Dawkins is saying that this is a process that is not in principle restricted to Earth. One could say the same about gravity; would that be an argument that gravity \"rules the universe\"?\n \n \nDoes it violate the first amendment to teach this in schools?\n\n It violates the First Amendment exactly as much as teaching about universal gravity does.\n Usually, I could leave it at that, but this is marc we're talking to here, so: That's a no, marc.\n \n \nOkay, you may now rip me a new one for copying something from Dawkins book.\n\n Uses for critique and education fall under Fair Use guidelines. I rip you a new one for lying and for making stupid assertions like the ones above.\n \n \nYou argue it like this?\n \nI could claim that you sexually violate chickens...\n\n\n As explained above, this is a counterargument to the validity of your argument. And I've referred to it repeatedly every time you make the same fallacy. I'm here to discuss the scientific position, and that includes pointing out the flaws in your reasoning.\n \n \nDawkins argues it with his above statement, that Darwinism is as all-encompassing as God is stated to be in the Bible\n\n Dawkins doesn't argue this; you simply took what he said and used your persecution complex to turn it into a piece of the EAC. There's no telling what else you'll \"get out\" of that book that really isn't in there. Perhaps you can audit an 11th grade English class to work on your comprehension skills?\n \n \n I have challenged marc to:[*]provide evidence that Dawkins and Hitchens use science to promote atheism[*]show me somebody who uses evolution as the basis to make \"political decisions concerning purpose and morality\"[*]show where evolutionary theory says anything about \"salvation\"[*]retract his accusation that I have switched definitions of evolution[*]provide any science textbook that makes a moral claim concerning abortion[*]show any instance of the cognitive evolution of humans has explicitly played any role in politics[*]support his insinuation that Dawkins uses false information to draw his conclusions[*]support his insinuation that the ACLU has argued or would argue that religion is equitable with mental retardation[*]provide evidence for his allegation of definition flip-flopping by the ACLU[*]provide any court finding or law that uses evolution to make arguments about \"purpose and morality\"[*]support his accusation that the ACLU is trying to destroy religion[*]support his assertion that Dawkins believes and argues that Darwinism rules the universeI have also challenged marc to either provide documentation of where I actually switched definitions of evolution while debating with him or retract his accusation to that effect and apologize for his slanderous lie. He has done neither; he clearly cannot do the former, because I have performed no flip-flop, but he will not take responsibility for his unethical actions. marc gets one more chance to address this discrepancy.\n \n In the meantime, here's a quote from Richard Dawkins for marc to read. marc, I hope you like the taste of crow.Interviewer: Many criticize you on the grounds that science can't answer some of the biggest questions or that science is unwilling or unable to offer those meaningful things that we just talked about. Is it fair to respond to your book or your arguments by pointing out insufficiencies of science?\n \n RD: There are some questions that science not only can't answer, but doesn't want to answer, things like, \"What is right? And What is wrong?\" or \"How shall we be comforted?\" Science has nothing to say about \"right\" or \"wrong.\" Moral philosophy does. There's another whole category of questions that science may not be able to answer -- the really deep questions of existence, like, \"Why is there something, rather than nothing?\" or \"Where did the laws of physics come from in the first place?\" It's an open question at the moment whether science will ever be able to answer questions like that.\n Dawkins says that science has nothing to say about moral philosophy, marc. You do know the meaning of \"nothing,\" right marc?",

   "I have never asked you for a definition of life. You did...\n\n Quite right. The question was necessary as soon as you declared that life is of a special character that can only exist after \"emergence.\" There is no reason for me to try to explain what caused \"emergence\" unless we know what you mean. We can't know what you mean until you define life. This is really all very simple.\n \n \nYou will never answer the question for you will never be happy with any definition of life in order not to answer the question. Why? because you don't have an answer, and you are too arrogant to admit it, perhaps?\n\n No, I don't have an answer because I don't have a question. You are using a term that has an unclear meaning. What if I were to demand you tell me what makes a plognark so special? What? You can't tell me? Is that because you are arrogant, or stupid, or mentally challenged? Of course not. It's because you don't know what a plognark is.\n \n \nto say that because a mule can not reproduce is not alive is stupid and you know it. The cells in the mule do reproduce and are alive.\n\n Of course it's stupid to say that a mule is not alive, but that's the conclusion we're stuck with if we use the \"definitions\" that are generally used. The property of reproductive ability applies to the organism as a whole, not components of the organism. After all, as you said, we consider the mule a living organism, not a nonliving collection of living things.\n \n \nYour signature is meaningless it is just a description not an explanation of how life emerges from just simple elements. where is the program or the recipe to create life, where does it reside? and where does it come from?\n and what is the program?\n\n Your question automatically assumes that \"life,\" whatever it actually is, contains some characteristic that cannot be explained based on its chemical components and must \"emerge\" from just simple elements. I question your assumption. What requires that life must \"emerge,\" (in whatever sense of that word you mean) from its chemical components? Why is a program/recipe required?\n \n \nYou don't have the answer so you avoid answering.\n\n Based on your response above, I could say the same about you.\n \n \nPick your definition of life and then tell me how it came about.\n\n I think that there is no way to define life with a cut-and-dried definition. There are a variety of entities that have the effect of a spectrum of chemical reactions ranging from simple to very complex. Biologists have seemed to draw the line between viruses and bacteria, but I consider this distinction arbitrary. Our general feelings about what is alive and what is not are based on our everyday observations on the macroscale. They are formed independently of the entire world of the microscale. Much in the same way that classical physics works for general, everyday things, but we can't use it for microscale applications because it is no longer an accurate representation (hence we have to use crazy quantum physics which seems nonsensical to most people), trying to shoehorn our macroscale understanding of life into the microscale world is a fool's errand.\n It's like saying, what wavelength is green? I could say 550nm. But why couldn't I say 552nm? Or 555? I could give several answers, and nobody would have a real counterargument until I got to some other color. A mule is alive. A bacterium is alive. A virus... hmm? Self-replicating RNA... uhh.. probably not, but why not? A rock is where I hit yellow, and everyone says, \"Whoa, not alive.\" But where is the boundary? Why is that the boundary? If you insist that there's something special about life such that it must \"emerge,\" then you ought to be able to tell me what is so special and -- in doing so -- tell us exactly which wavelength qualifies as the first green.",

   "I haven't found any 'reason for being'. I haven't found any reason for the existence of life. I haven't found any reason for the existence of something, anything.\n\n \n Again you are looking to be special. What if our reason for being is nothing more than the earth was favorable for life to begin? I have a 1'x7\" patch of dirt between my sidewalk and driveway that has a chili bush growing in it. I didn't plant it and all that has ever bloomed there were weeds. There are much better spots in my yard (in my opinion) to grow. Yet for some odd reason it grows and thrives in this little drank not well lit area of my yard. Its chilies have added a zing to many of my dishes for two years now. But why did it grow there? I know the seed came from a bird who ate a chili from my neighbor's bushes. I also know that many birds have eaten his chilies and passed seeds all over my lawn but why are there no bushes closer to my trees or my fence where birds perch. Science has always felt that the earth is not unique in the ability to produce life... Sometimes it starts and takes hold, sometimes it starts and dies off.\n \n \nHowever I do ask and have asked here: how come that inorganic matter under appropriate circumstances gives rise to life. If there is no inherent information in the elements (nothing like a programme or something similar) how come that life that requires organisation, information and the passing of that information comes about?\n\n \n First, it makes no sense to assume that cognitive ability and atomic composition are directly relative. If i showed you a handful of seeds and grains and told you I was going to make a pie with them, you would think it ludicrous. It's not until you know they are apple seeds and wheat that it makes sense to a point but it could takes 20 years before you see a pie. Even then apples and wheat need to be harvested, milled/cut, mixed (with chicken embryos, cow lactation, bicarbonate of soda, cane extract and bark) then baked. The end result looks nothing like seeds and grain. So to go directly from matter to thought processes is a ridiculous jump. Dr. Carl Segan said that normal views of time do not relate well when dealing with cosmic scales or evolution, science uses the term \"Deep Time\". Hundreds of millions to billions of years. This is the biggest downfall to creationists trying to comprehend evolution... Deep Time is truly unfathomable. The earth is 4.54 Billion years old. It took 1 Billion years before the right mixture of molecules were even available and another 1.25 billion to brew and create the first life forms... slimes and froth.\n \n We can make the building blocks of life, but how they came to arrange themselves to create simple life (below single celled life) is still a mystery. We do know that carbon is part of the key. It is one of the most stable yet versatile elements known and would be needed to bind molecules and proteins together. Life is chemistry... just like making a pie. If you rush it you get waste. Why earth, because it was favorable... nothing more. No deep philosophical reason. You get on a bus, find a seat and sit. Or... a bird poops and chili peppers grow.",

Life is just another form of chemistry -- even conscious life. All the necessary information for self-organising systems is inherent in the electronic structure of atoms, which ensures the existence of specific chemical interactions between molecules. The rules of assembly are regular and hierarchical: atoms make individual molecules make polymers make supramolecular structures make cells make multicellular organisms.\n \n Of course, one can't look at a carbon atom and predict the existence of giraffes, for example, because giraffes are contingent evolutionary events. There are probably billions of different ways of making a functional organism but only a few of those will ever see reality, owing to the contingency of events that leads to their evolution. But now we know how matter self-organises into ever more complex structures, the emergence of living systems, wonderful though it remains, is no longer inexplicable in principle. We don't know the exact pathway followed in earth's prehistory, but we can make an informed estimate that one or more such pathways must exist.\n \n If you are looking for ultimate, metaphysical explanations, science can't provide them, at least not yet.

   "No you didn't. How do quotes from Julian Huxley and Barbour that say nothing about Dawkins or Hitchens or anything that Dawkins or Hitchens says have anything to do with backing up your assertions about Dawkins and Hitchens? The truth is that you've supplied no argumentation for your assertion.\n \n \n All you can seem to do is simply baldly repeat yourself as if that's all it takes. \"Ohh, but everyone knows that this is true!\" \"It's so obvious!\" \"See, it's common knowledge\" that I don't have to support! Get real. You're lying, you can't back up your points, and you don't even care. More lying for Jesus, huh marc? \n\n \n \n It just seems to me that anyone who would read at this forum, let alone post here, would have some general idea of evolutionary history, and current popular evolutionary thought. Since you don't, here's a primer for you. Keeping in mind that I used the phrase \"Dawkins, Hitchens, and others\", it only makes sense to check out some recent book titles. Dawkins wrote one called \"THE GOD DELUSION\", and Hitchens is called \"GOD IS NOT GREAT\". Some of the \"others\" would be atheist/evolutionist authors like Sam Harris, Jack Huberman, Victor Stenger, Edward O. Wilson, Daniel Dennett, John Loftus, Jason Long, many many others. The title of Victor Stenger's book is \"HOW SCIENCE SHOWS THAT GOD DOES NOT EXIST\". Here is Richard Dawkins commentary on THAT BOOK;\n \n \n\"Darwin chased God out of his old haunts in biology, and he scurried for safety down the rabbit hole of physics. The laws and constants of the universe, we were told, are too good to be true: a set-up, carefully tuned to allow the eventual evolution of life. It needed a good physicist to show us the fallacy, and Victor Stenger lucidly does so. The faithful won't change their minds, of course (that is what faith means) but Victor Stenger drives a pack of energetic ferrets down the last major bolt hole and God is running out of refuges in which to hide. I learned an enormous amount from this splendid book.\" \n\n \n http://www.amazon.com/God-Failed-Hypothesis-Science-Shows/dp/1591024811/ref=pd_sim_b_img_1\n \n What do you suppose he learned? Certainly nothing about biology, he's a biologist himself, while Stenger is a physicist. Did he learn that Stenger's physics \"sent God running out of refuges in which to hide?\" Did he learn that other branches of science besides his own, couples with his personal atheism, to \"send God running\" or, in my previous words, \"ridicule religion\"? \n Stephen Weinberg, a professor and author, makes this statement;\n \n \nOne of the great achievements of science has been, if not to make it impossible for intelligent people to be religious, then at least to make it possible for them not to be religious.\" \n\n \n http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/weinberg.html\n \n From this same link;\n \nWeinberg predicts that the biggest impact of advances in physics will be cultural, not technological. \n\n \n Cultural, not technological? If physics can be that way, could evolution not much more be that way? Evolution is involved in (cultural) court decisions far more than physics is.\n \n That's your lesson on current popular evolutionary thought. If it wasn't enough, check out some book titles from Sam Harris, Jack Huberman, Joan Konner, David Eller, David Mills, Michael Onfray, etc, etc, etc. If Dawkins \"learned an enormous amount\" from Stenger's book, would it be impossible for all of the above to learn from each other, in their militant evolutionist/atheist crusades? \n \n Now for some evolutionary history. Have you ever heard the phrase \"social Darwinism\"?\n \n \nSocial Darwinism is the idea that Charles Darwin's theory can be extended and applied to the social domain, i.e. that just as competition between individual organisms drives biological evolutionary change (speciation) through the survival of the fittest, competition between individuals, groups, nations or ideas drives social evolution in human societies. \n\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Darwinism\n \n \"Extended and applied to the social domain\" - to ridicule religion, maybe? You can be sure that the above authors were fully aware of this history. Unlike you, book authors really do have to do research. The phrase \"social Darwinism\" has been around since 1944, but it's roots go back much further than that. Have you ever heard of Herbert Spencer? \n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Spencer\n \n \nSpencer developed an all-embracing conception of evolution as the progressive development of the physical world, biological organisms, the human mind, and human culture and societies. \n\n \n Human culture and societies?? He's from Darwin's generation, and again, you can be sure that all the book authors that I mentioned above are fully aware of his work. \n \n \nIf it's required reading in any schools, it's not as promotion of atheism. \n\n \n Am I not allowed to say that if Dembski's book(s) are required reading in schools, that it's not a promotion of religion? Why not, because there is a double standard? \n \n \n You still haven't shown that the book does promote atheism. Moreover, considering the slew of \"Bible as literature\" courses that are being taught, you really are in no position to complain. \n\n \n There's plenty of room to complain. Science is a much higher level subject than literature courses. Much more likely to be involved in decisions concerning \"human culture and societies\" than is literature. Literature is often fiction. Social Darwinism seeks to portray the Bible as fiction. I strongly suspect you'll find just that in the above mentioned book \" HOW SCIENCE SHOWS THAT GOD DOES NOT EXIST\". \n \n \nShow me any instance where the cognitive evolution of humans has explicitly played any role in American politics.\n\n \n http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=41443\n \n The ACLU is constantly fighting battles for evolutionists/ atheists, in American politics. \n \n \nThis doesn't really answer the question. Are you insinuating that Dawkins uses false information to come to his conclusions? If so, please show us the information and show support for your assertion that it is false.\n\n \n Dawkins uses questionable information to come to ideological conclusions. All the above book authors do too, to different degrees. \n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_O_Wilson\n \n \nSeveral of Wilson's colleagues at Harvard, such as Richard Lewontin and Stephen Jay Gould, were vehemently opposed to his ideas regarding sociobiology. Marshall Sahlins's work The Use and Abuse of Biology was a direct criticism of Wilson's theories. \n\n \n As we can see, evolutionists squabble among themselves to a comparable degree as.....CHRISTIANS?!! Religions are like that!! Christians squabble over details, while agreeing on the basic, that Christ offers free forgivness to anyone who accepts it. Evolutionists squabble over details, while agreeing on the basic, there is no creator.\n \n \n \nNice one, marc. Complete ignorance of context and previous statements. I was saying that you will only get varying definitions of evolution from anti-evolutionists.\n\n \n And you are WRONG about that, as the above Wilson link shows. \n \n \n \n \n \nBut you don't recognize this, either because you have non-existent short term memory or because of selective amnesia. Here's a reminder:\n \n \nOriginally Posted by electrolyte \n Listen, marcky marc, [snip]\n\n \n So, you can continue with your phony persecution pity party, or you can join the real world and pay attention to what I say. Of course you won't add me to your ignore list; you ignore what I say already. \n\n \n As I said before, I'd never put you on ignore, you're way too much entertainment. It's really fascinating to me how you NEVER concede a point. Some of the authors above are evolutionary biologists - the ones who write books claiming that science proves there is no God. I know this is where it is standard practice to run to theistic evolution. Isn't it logical that theistic evolutionlists would be upset at claims that science proves there is no God? Could you link me to just one really thorough debate on that subject between an atheist evolutionist and a theistic evolutionist? Just one? \n \n \nAnd if you're too busy having wonderful sexy fun with those chickens...\n You see, marc, you don't just get to make things up and pass them off as accurate. Can you show where the ACLU is arguing that religion should be equated with mental retardation? No? So you're just a liar? \n\n \n Many popular biologists, like Dawkins and Wilson argue exactly that. It's controversial, there's no question that they and others like them are introducing it to public thought today more than ever. Past philosophers such as Spencer have done it too, but todays communications allow it to spread like never before. For you to pretend that there's some type of impenetrable wall between that thought and future court actions (or present unreported court action) isn't compatible with your brilliant debating, you know, your brilliance in calling me a chicken violator. \n \n \nOnly \"AFTER,\" you say? Okay then, feel free to pore over the trial transcripts from McLean, Epperson, Edwards, and Kitzmiller and find all of the claims of the evolutionists that evolution is anything more than I said. If this alleged switch only happens \"after\" the decision, then \"BEFORE\" the decision should be support for your accusations. Provide them. \n\n \n \n This would be a multiple fallacy. Failure to state;\n \n http://www.don-lindsay-archive.org/skeptic/arguments.html#state\n \n \n\u0095if you make enough attacks, and ask enough questions, you may never have to actually define your own position on the topic. \n\n \n And \"argument by question\"; \n \n \n\u0095asking your opponent a question which does not have a snappy answer. (Or anyway, no snappy answer that the audience has the background to understand.) Your opponent has a choice: he can look weak or he can look long-winded. For example, \"How can scientists expect us to believe that anything as complex as a single living cell could have arisen as a result of random natural processes?\" \n\n \n His example of course, is atheist friendly. But it really does go both ways. You've committed that fallacy a lot in this post of course. I'll ignore many of them, because they ask for details concerning evolution that you never require of yourself when criticizing Intelligent Design. \n \n \nYour ignorance of fallacies is not a fallacy on my part. Here's a primer on no-true-Scotsman.\n\n \n \nNo true Scotsman is a fallacy of equivocation and question begging. Its name was coined by Antony Flew in his 1975 book Thinking About Thinking - or do I sincerely want to be right?.\n\n \n Is Anthony Flew the final authority on fallacies? Or is Don Lindsay? Can anyone be a fallacy proclaimer? Or are YOU an authority on fallacies? According to Lindsays list, you have committed a lot more in these two posts than you have accussed me of. \n \n \nPersonally, I haven't read the book, so anything I say is mere speculation. \n\n \n What a coincidence - I already knew that! It's very clear that you argue what you think Dawkins means, without knowing much of anything about Dawkins! You do the same about Intelligent Design, and Christianity as well. \n \n \n \n \nI think that your trying to derive some sort of incredibly meaningful message from that single adjective is no less silly than arguing that because Dawkins used a noun -- Watchmaker -- that he's really a theist in describe and was referring to the Christian God. Or maybe he's a JW and secretly honoring The Watchtower. My guess would be that he is arguing that evolution has no religious teleology.\n\n \n Did his review of Stengers book above make it clear to you that your guess would be WRONG? Do you do this much guessing in your understanding of evolution? \n \n \nBut you haven't done that, marc. All you've done is stomp and rant and rave and blow steam from your ears and nose \n\n \n You're doing the vulgar name calling and I'm not. emoticon_idea \n \n \nGee, marc, if you really, truly have such terrible memory problems, let me know and I'll stop making fun of them. Meanwhile, let me remind you that I slaughtered you in our debate using these arguments. Terrible incompetence? unparalleled incomprehension? memory recall deficiencies? Which one of these is it? \n\n \n None of the above. That debate wasn't about evolution, it was about history. You edged me in that debate because of one word in the resolution \"ALL\". If the word was \"many\" or even \"most\" it very well may have been different. In spite of the cakewalk block job, the judges didn't indicate that it was a \"slaughter\". You're on the receiving end of a true slaughter right now, only a month or so after that formal debate. The Lord does move in mysterious ways. \n \n \nSwing and a miss. I already listed the court cases: which one makes political decisions concerning purpose and morality, marc? Name them. I dare you. Find me any law that promotes evolution as some determining factor in purpose and morality. Do it. \n\n \n It was actually a home run. You just moved the goalposts - fallacy. Argument by question, another fallacy. \n \n \nSHOW THE EVIDENCE, chickenlover. (This is, by the way, what I'll be calling you every time you tell another lie and fail to back it up.)\n\n \n I know. It's common in locker rooms of middle schools, mainly by failing students who have unhappy childhoods. It's a long list of fallacies - . Ad Hominem, Needling, Emotive language, others. You're very angry. Remember, people don't get angry when lies are told about them, they get angry when the truth is told about them. They get angry when they're getting slaughtered, and their childish nature doesn't allow them to concede points. \n \n \n \nThis doesn't answer the question at all. (Comprehension problems seems the likely culprit at this point.) Even if we assume that Dembski isn't full of spit -- which is a terrible assumption given the evidence to the contrary -- many evolutionists argue that ID is a religion, and many IDists argue that evolution is a religion. How does arguing that evolution is like [b]something that isn't a religion support the argument that evolution is a religion?\n\n \n Because ID is treated as a religion by the courts, and evolution is not, even though they are comparable. The argument says that either both are a religion equally, or both are not a religion, and deserve equal treatment politically. \n \n \nIf there is no God, what makes things fall? Please don't say gravity, because gravity does not have a mind, and it does not have a purpose. Either way, things do not fall any differently in gravity than they do in atheism. \n\n \n So you're now equating evolution with gravity? I thought you said above that your definitions of evolution didn't vary. \n \n \n \nSo, using marc's reasoning, gravity is atheistic. We can do the same with countless other examples, and we can do it using philosophies other than atheism. Two plus two equals four exactly the same in math class as it does in your church, therefore math is an intrusion of Christianity into the classroom and is a violation of the Constitution.\n marc, we can parody your balderdash all day long. And, just so you're clear, parody is a valid form of counterargument.\n\n \n How is \"parody\" distinguished from the fallacy of \"needling\"? If you're an expert on fallacies, I hope you'll explain it. How about a new fallacy; the GRAVITY fallacy? It seems like evolutionists start babbling about gravity every time they don't know what else to say.",

   "Hitler? Every last wave of Crusaders? The Inquisition? But the question is not actually about track record, it's about causal tendencies. \n\n \n I agree, once your lies are exposed. Hitlers casual tendencies were towards Darwinism FAR more than they were Christian. \n \n \nBy the time Hitler rose to power, the Darwinian ethic penetrated German culture so deeply that the received Judeo/Christian moral tradition was effectively overthrown.\n \n One cannot comprehend Hitler's immense popularity in Germany without understanding the ethical dimension to his worldview and his political policies...Hitler embraced an evolutionary ethic that made Darwinian fitness and health...and the Darwinian struggle for existence...the only criteria for moral standards. \n\n \n http://www.orthodoxytoday.org/articles4/JacobseDarwinHitler.shtml\n \n \nAnd while you may think that puts you in the better position, none of history, none of the research, and none of the logic supports your position. (Shall I remind you that the ratio of atheists in the U.S public to atheists in U.S. prisons is 10:1?) \n\n \n That's all an \"appeal to anonymous authority\", a fallacy. \n \n \nMost likely. I don't see any support for his assertions. But I'll give him the benefit of the doubt that there was actually more to what he wrote than just your excerpt. No, Dembski's work is deserving of unabashed rending even in its entirety. \n\n \n That paragraph actually stands alone very well. It said more in 44 words than evolutionists are able to say in multi-thousand word posts. Here, lets look at it again;\n \n \nCritics of ID resort to a classic defense mechanism; they project onto ID the very thing that ID unmasks in their own views, namely that Darwinism, especially as it has been taken up by today's intellectual elite, has itself become a project in theology.\" \n\n \n \n \nI've been kicking your XXX on the subject matter for much longer than I've been ridiculing your indefensible positions. The reason you don't realize this remains one of the great mysteries of 4forums.\n By the way, if you're interested in seeing Dembski's work ripped to shreds, just head over to Panda's Thumb and do a search for his name. \n\n \n \n Okay, I did that, and found this paragraph;\n \n \nWilliam Dembski has just posted an essay on human origins on www.designinference.com. If there was any doubt that the Intelligent Design movement was about religious belief rather than science, this essay dispels that doubt.\n\n \n How does this compare with the following paragraph;\n \n Richard Dawkins has just posted a positive review on a book called \" How science shows that God does not exist\". If there was any doubt that the evolutionary movement was about atheist belief rather than science, this review dispels that doubt.\n \n Can you show a difference in those two paragraphs, or is there a double standard?\n \n \nTell me, marc, how many brilliant breakthroughs have IDists come up with... you know, ever, about anything? \n\n \n Darwins Black Box would be a good read for you. Evolutionists have emotionally discredited it, but have not factually discredited it. Too many gaps in evolution. When they proclaim that those gaps will someday be filled, then we have \"argument to the future\", yet another fallacy. \n \n \n \nRight, the EAC. Do you have any support for this conspiracy, chickenlover? \n\n \n More support than you have for the EIDC. (Evil Intelligent Design Conspiracy)\n \n \n \nI laughed loudly at you, and you still didn't see the irony of your position. Let me try again, and I'll type slowly and use small words for you, marc.\n Your source said that Hitching is an authority on the subject. Hitching said that he is a reliable authority because he is a member of the Royal Archaelogical Institute. The RAI says that Hitching is not a member. Your argument is that the Royal Archaeological Institute is a bunch of liars.\n Do you see the paradox? Either the RAI is a respectable organization, and Hitching was not a member, or the RAI is not the least bit respectable, and Hitching is a member. Again, you just take your pick.\n Nothing says that I can only use your source. Such an argument is asinine. I'll challenge you to a two round debate right now if one of the stipulations is that you can only use me or my links as sources. \n\n \n In addition to your normal fallacies, this is also the fallacy of poisoning the wells. \n \n\u0095discrediting the sources used by your opponent. This is a variation of Ad Hominem. \n\n \n What hitching said in Steubers link was quite brief, a true, general statement. \n \n \nThe new biology is looking afresh at living things -- at their shapes, their patterns, their dynamics and their relationships. If, after more than a century, natural selection has been tested and found wanting, and if we are left once again with a sense of ignorance about origins, Darwin would not have minded. Science is a voyage of discovery, and beyond each horizon there is another. \n\n \n Why can't you address what he said, rather than attack him personally? Darwinism really is found wanting in several areas. Why do you want to be dishonest and say that it's not? \n \n \nAh, but ID does fit the standards that your author tries to apply! \n\n \n It may, but that makes it equal to evolution, doesn't it? You claim those standards are not applicable to evolution, yet are applicable to ID!\n \n \nHow can you possibly say that ID isn't a religion if it passes this test you so want to apply to evolution? \n\n \n The same way that you say ID IS a religion, even though evolution has all the same characteristics! \n \n \n \nID also has an overtly religious background and motivation. And for you to say that evolutionists have a double standard here... well, let's just say that you wouldn't know an iron if it hit you in the face. \n\n \n EVOLUTION HAS AN OVERTLY ATHEIST BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION. It has been around a lot longer than ID, that is the only difference. \n \n \n \nWhat statements from his page about evolution that I'm calling lies are actually true? Can you provide evidence that they're actually true, chickenlover? I get angry when you lie, and then call me a liar for nailing you on it. \n\n \n You would have to be specific about what those statements are. More than just one from Hitchings, maybe?\n \n \nI'll give you a topic: your author tries to argue that natural selection actually has been found lacking, and that therefore evolution as a whole is thrown into doubt. Please explain where natural selection has failed to explain our observations, and where other aspects of evolution -- such as genetic drift, gene flow, sexual selection, exaptation, etc -- give us any reason to doubt that evolutionary theory is correct. \n\n \n The topic would be origins - evolution cannot explain them. Complexity of the simplest forms of life have been found to be almost infinitely more complex than Darwin knew. \n \n \nFor decades science has been frustrated, trying to reconcile the astonishing discoveries of modern biochemistry to a nineteenth-century theory that cannot accommodate them. \n\n \n http://books.google.com/books?id=7L8mkq4jG6EC&dq=ernst+haeckel+simple+albuminous\n \n That frustration shows in your name calling. \n \n \nYou have some serious problems with reading comprehension or a persecution complex, but probably both. Dawkins is saying that this is a process that is not in principle restricted to Earth. One could say the same about gravity; would that be an argument that gravity \"rules the universe\"? \n\n \n Natural selection, gene flow, genetic drift, sexual selection, exaptation, etc, just became \"gravity\"? Evolution is very complex, then when applied to the universe, it becomes as simple and predictable as gravity. Definition switch - thank you. \n \n \nAs explained above, this is a counterargument to the validity of your argument. And I've referred to it repeatedly every time you make the same fallacy. I'm here to discuss the scientific position, and that includes pointing out the flaws in your reasoning. \n\n \n You point out flaws by name calling? You completely exempt yourself from fallacies, don't you? \n \n \nDawkins doesn't argue this; you simply took what he said and used your persecution complex to turn it into a piece of the EAC. There's no telling what else you'll \"get out\" of that book that really isn't in there. Perhaps you can audit an 11th grade English class to work on your comprehension skills? \n\n \n You just don't understand that Dawkins is arguing that, because as you said, you don't have his book, and because you know nothing about how all-encompassing God is, according to the Bible. \n \n Do you have a persecution complex in your terror of ID? The EIDC?\n \n [QUOTE]I have challenged marc to:\n \n[*]provide evidence that Dawkins and Hitchens use science to promote atheism\n CHECK\n \n \n[*]show me somebody who uses evolution as the basis to make \"political decisions concerning purpose and morality\"\n CHECK\n \n \n[*]show where evolutionary theory says anything about \"salvation\"\n(it was in Stuebers link - you missed it)\n \n \n[*]retract his accusation that I have switched definitions of evolution\n (laid bare the fact that you do switch them)\n \n \n[*]provide any science textbook that makes a moral claim concerning abortion\n(abortion is unrelated to discussion, fallacy)\n \n \n[*]show any instance of the cognitive evolution of humans has explicitly played any role in politics\n CHECK\n \n \n[*]support his insinuation that Dawkins uses false information to draw his conclusions\n (did not make that insinuation, fallacy)\n \n \n[*]support his insinuation that the ACLU has argued or would argue that religion is equitable with mental retardation\n CHECK\n \n \n[*]provide evidence for his allegation of definition flip-flopping by the ACLU\n {don't remember you asking that, but it's easily done)\n \n \n[*]provide any court finding or law that uses evolution to make arguments about \"purpose and morality\" \n CHECK\n \n \n[*]support his accusation that the ACLU is trying to destroy religion\n again, not asked for, but easily done. \n \n \n[*]support his assertion that Dawkins believes and argues that Darwinism rules the universe\n CHECK\n \n \nI have also challenged marc to either provide documentation of where I actually switched definitions of evolution while debating with him or retract his accusation to that effect and apologize for his slanderous lie. He has done neither; he clearly cannot do the former, because I have performed no flip-flop, but he will not take responsibility for his unethical actions. marc gets one more chance to address this discrepancy. \n\n \n It was the gravity fallacy, remember? Gravity is supposed to have been unchanging for billions of years. Evolution is not steady and consistant and unchanging. It's about change. \n \n \nIn the meantime, here's a quote from Richard Dawkins for marc to read. marc, I hope you like the taste of crow.Interviewer: Many criticize you on the grounds that science can't answer some of the biggest questions or that science is unwilling or unable to offer those meaningful things that we just talked about. Is it fair to respond to your book or your arguments by pointing out insufficiencies of science?\n \n RD: There are some questions that science not only can't answer, but doesn't want to answer, things like, \"What is right? And What is wrong?\" or \"How shall we be comforted?\" Science has nothing to say about \"right\" or \"wrong.\" Moral philosophy does. There's another whole category of questions that science may not be able to answer -- the really deep questions of existence, like, \"Why is there something, rather than nothing?\" or \"Where did the laws of physics come from in the first place?\" It's an open question at the moment whether science will ever be able to answer questions like that.\n Dawkins says that science has nothing to say about moral philosophy, marc. You do know the meaning of \"nothing,\" right marc?\n\n \n Do you know the meaning of \"compare\"? \n \n \n\"Darwin chased God out of his old haunts in biology, and he scurried for safety down the rabbit hole of physics.\n\n \n Does that look like \"nothing to say\"? On page 10 of the book that you don't have, he also said that \"Darwin made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist. Depending on the setting, evolution \"has nothing to say\" sometimes, and other times it \"chases God out\". Dawkins does it, you do it, countless others do it.",

   "Keeping in mind that I used the phrase \"Dawkins, Hitchens, and others\",\n\n And I challenged you to back up your assertion. That means that you show that Dawkins and Hitchens and others do this. Mainly, I wanted you to support your statement about those you actually named. You haven't done so.\n \n \nDawkins wrote one called \"THE GOD DELUSION\", and Hitchens is called \"GOD IS NOT GREAT\".\n\n Do either of these argue for atheism based on science? Do they? Well?\n \n \nThat's your lesson on current popular evolutionary thought. If it wasn't enough, check out some book titles from Sam Harris, Jack Huberman, Joan Konner, David Eller, David Mills, Michael Onfray, etc, etc, etc.\n\n I'll just take the first one: What did either of Sam Harris's books have to do with evolution? It looks like what you're doing here is taking titles that reference religion and are asserting that they support your point even though you have no knowledge of their content. I think it's especially telling that you attack Dawkins and Hitchens with such vile and yet can't actually show where they do what you accuse.\n \n \nAm I not allowed to say that if Dembski's book(s) are required reading in schools, that it's not a promotion of religion? Why not, because there is a double standard?\n\n You can say anything you want, and you clearly do here on this forum. The question is whether you can actually support your point. Tell me, has Dembski actually written any mathematics textbooks? or are you just pulling more Bos excrement out of your XXX?\n \n \nSocial Darwinism seeks to portray the Bible as fiction.\n\n Social Darwinism?! Social Darwinism is a defunct political idea and has nothing to do with science. I swear you're just making this stuff up as you go along.\n \n \nI strongly suspect you'll find just that in the above mentioned book \" HOW SCIENCE SHOWS THAT GOD DOES NOT EXIST\".\n\n I strongly suspect that you're wrong, and I'm absolutely sure that you still haven't done what I asked you to do.\n \n \nDawkins uses questionable information to come to ideological conclusions.\n\n I challenged you to identify the \"questionable\" information and show why it is questionable.\n \n \nAs we can see, evolutionists squabble among themselves...\n\n That's about sociobiology, not about what evolution is. Pathetic, marc.\n I have a high school classmate and friend who works for E. O. Wilson. I talked to him several days ago. I have his phone number. Would you like me to call him and ask him to get Wilson to give a definition of evolution? Or will you just (rightfully) admit that you really don't have any reason to believe that Wilson defines evolution any differently than everybody else?\n \n \nAnd you are WRONG about that, as the above Wilson link shows.\n\n You need to learn how to read. \"Sociobiology\" is not the same thing as \"evolution.\"\n \n \nIt's really fascinating to me how you NEVER concede a point.\n\n Give me reason to believe that I'm wrong, and I'll concede that point.\n \n \n \nCan you show where the ACLU is arguing that religion should be equated with mental retardation? No? So you're just a liar?\nMany popular biologists, like Dawkins and Wilson argue exactly that. It's controversial, there's no question that they and others like them are introducing it to public thought today more than ever.\n\n So you can't show where the ACLU is arguing that religion should be equated with mental retardation. That strongly supports the idea that you are a liar, marc.\n \n \nThis would be a multiple fallacy. Failure to state;\n\n Wake up, marc. My position is clear. You made the claim that the ACLU changes its position only after trials are over, but you haven't supported your assertion with one iota of evidence. If it makes you feel better, then instead of finding all instances of this, then just find one.\n \n \nasking your opponent a question which does not have a snappy answer. (Or anyway, no snappy answer that the audience has the background to understand.)\n\n This is for a spoken debate, Holmes. You have all the time you need and as many posts as it takes to come up with a response.\n \n \nAccording to Lindsays list, you have committed a lot more in these two posts than you have accussed me of.\n\n Then identify them. I notice that you don't actually deny committing the fallacy I identified.\n \n \nIt's very clear that you argue what you think Dawkins means, without knowing much of anything about Dawkins!\n\n So not reading one of his books means that I don't know \"much of anything about Dawkins\"? That's like saying that because you haven't read every book about Christianity, you don't know much at all about Christianity. Pathetic and invalid argumentation really is your forte, isn't it?\n \n \nMy guess would be that he is arguing that evolution has no religious teleology.\nDid his review of Stengers book above make it clear to you that your guess would be WRONG?\n\n Tell me what his review said about RELIGIOUS TELEOLOGY OF EVOLUTION, marc.\n \n \nDo you do this much guessing in your understanding of evolution?\n\n None whatsoever. Do you have any evidence that I do? Didn't think so.\n \n \nI already listed the court cases: which one makes political decisions concerning purpose and morality, marc?\n\n You just moved the goalposts - fallacy. Argument by question, another fallacy.\n\n I did neither. First, you said that there were people using evolution to influence \"political decisions concerning purpose and morality.\" So I challenged your chickenloving XXX to support your assertion. You posted a link that had NOTHING to do using evolution to influence \"political decisions concerning purpose and morality.\" If you disagree, you should be able to show ANY ONE INSTANCE of a law that states that evolution is the determining factor in purpose and morality. Second, the fact that all you have to do is show ONE means that I don't require an extensive list (which would still be for this written exchange, not a timed spoken debate).\n \n \nHow does arguing that evolution is like something that isn't a religion support the argument that evolution is a religion?\n\n Because ID is treated as a religion by the courts, and evolution is not, even though they are comparable. The argument says that either both are a religion equally, or both are not a religion, and deserve equal treatment politically.\n\n What the hell is wrong with you, marc? You're \"answering\" the question by restating the claim that elicited the question. \"It's like this because the courts claim otherwise.\" Wha? Are you nuts? Sure, there is an argument that they deserve equal treatment, but that argument has been rejected, and you haven't shown any reason to believe that it was rejected wrongfully.\n \n \nSo you're now equating evolution with gravity? I thought you said above that your definitions of evolution didn't vary.\n\n Help me out here, marc: Do you have such severe comprehension problems that you don't understand that I was parodying your \"counterargument\" to expose its absurdity, or do you just have no response for this exposing of your argument's absurdity? Or, you know, come up with another option, but I'd prefer if you actually address the challenge to your position instead of being cowardly.\n \n \nHow is \"parody\" distinguished from the fallacy of \"needling\"?\n\n Parody is a valid philosophical method of counterargument. Whether you feel needled when somebody shows your argument to be stupid is really neither here nor there. But for you to (wrongfully) accuse me of needling (\"simply attempting to make the other person angry, without trying to address the argument at hand\") in the same breath that you purposely avoid my argument is the height of hypocrisy.\n \n \nI agree, once your lies are exposed. Hitlers casual tendencies were towards Darwinism FAR more than they were Christian.\n\n First, no evolutionary viewpoint supports Hitler's idea that there is a master race. Second, Hitler was not an atheist. Third -- and most importantly for the purposes of this topic -- Hitler's ideas were not elicited by atheism. Even if we accepted that Hitler was inspired by the idea of Darwinism, Darwinism/evolution is not atheism. Kinda forgot that, didn't you, marc?\n \n \nThat's all an \"appeal to anonymous authority\", a fallacy.\n\n marc, I have an amazing thing for you to see.\n Somebody has challenged one of my statements. I made the claim that about 1 in 10 Americans is an atheist. Now, in a move that's apparently completely foreign to you, watch as I provide evidence: viola\n \n \nThat paragraph actually stands alone very well. It said more in 44 words than evolutionists are able to say in multi-thousand word posts.\n\n Yes, and I'll say it again: it makes the claim but has no support. You don't get to just repeat things some number of times and they magically become true.\n \n \nCan you show a difference in those two paragraphs, or is there a double standard?\n\n marc, this is a parody. So, we know that you recognize that parody is a valid method of counterargumentation, despite your ranting and raving and whining above. Unfortunately for you, the analogy drawn by the parody must be accurate in order to be a successful parody. So let's take a look:\n I can show a difference: Dembski wrote an essay about human origins as a subset of ID. Dawkins wrote a review of a book that he didn't author. But really, it's the content that matters more here. The Panda's Thumb excerpt says nothing substantive to support the assertion, and because you didn't link to the page, I don't know what either the essay says or the Panda's Thumb says about the essay. We can also say that even if Dawkins believed that evolution disproves God's existence (which he does not), his agreement with such an assertion is not proof that evolution about disproving God instead of explaining origins.\n \n \nEvolutionists have emotionally discredited it, but have not factually discredited it.\n\n Behe has no response to the argument of exaptation, no response to the argument of scaffolding, no response to the fact that we know how allegedly IC structures evolved. IC has been factually discredited. That's why Behe tried to revise his definition, and that's why Dembski tried to revise Behe's revision. Dembki's revision requires proving a universal negative in order to prove IC even exists. It is impossible to prove a universal negative. So not only have evolutionists factually discredited IC, IDists have discredited IC.\n \n \nToo many gaps in evolution.\n\n There are more gaps in your knowledge of evolution than there are gaps in evolutionary theory. Moreover, there is no scientific or philosophical reason to believe that missing explanations of evolutionary theory are evidence for ID or for God.\n \n \nMore support than you have for the EIDC. (Evil Intelligent Design Conspiracy)\n\n You evidently didn't read the Dover trial transcripts. You could save time and read the decision, but it would make you cry.\n \n \nIn addition to your normal fallacies, this is also the fallacy of poisoning the wells.\n\n You are truly delusional. First, that's not what poisoning the well actually is. Second, it was you who accused the RAI of being liars, even though Hitching was the one who was using his association with the RAI as his source of credibility.\n \n \nDarwinism really is found wanting in several areas. Why do you want to be dishonest and say that it's not?\n\n You are being dishonest in saying that it is. Do you have any evidence that our understanding of evolutionary processes leads us to believe that we are ignorant of origins?\n \n \nIt may, but that makes it equal to evolution, doesn't it? You claim those standards are not applicable to evolution, yet are applicable to ID!\n\n Ah, marc, you did exactly what I wanted you to do. You can either argue that evolution is a religion due to these criteria, which also conclude that ID is a religion, and be stuck with ID being religion. Or you can reject the criteria as invalid and still have the possibility that ID isn't religion. I argued the latter. You can't have it both ways.\n \n \nThe same way that you say ID IS a religion, even though evolution has all the same characteristics!\n\n All the same characteristics? Really? All of them? Where does evolution say that there is a designer? Where does evolution appeal to unknown causes? Where does evolution appeal to teleology? Can you answer even one of these questions, marc?\n \n \nEVOLUTION HAS AN OVERTLY ATHEIST BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION.\n\n Darwin wanted to be a clergyman, Holmes. He was not motivated by atheism, hatred of God, or anything of the sort.\n \n \nYou would have to be specific about what those statements are. More than just one from Hitchings, maybe?\n\n Any of the statements on the page that you linked written by the page author that I've taken issue with. Seriously, just pick two or three.\n \n \nThe topic would be origins - evolution cannot explain them.\n\n Origins of species? Origins of characteristics? Origins of genes? To which are you referring?\n \n \nThat frustration shows in your name calling.\n\n Or the name calling is warranted due to your behavior. Did you miss the part where I actually explained very clearly that calling you \"chickenlover\" is an indicator of your failure to support your points and not an actual implication that you violate chickens?\n \n \nNatural selection, gene flow, genetic drift, sexual selection, exaptation, etc, just became \"gravity\"?\n\n I need another name to call you when your reading comprehension -- or rather, lack thereof -- makes communicating with you impossible.\n Dawkins said that Darwinian processes would occur with life anywhere in the universe. You lied and said that Dawkins said that Darwinism rules the universe. Science tells us that gravity occurs everywhere in the universe. It is ridiculous to say that gravity rules the universe.\n It's a parody, marc. You're being parodied. Now you're pretending that I'm calling Darwinism the same thing as gravity. I didn't switch definitions of anything, so you lie when you say I do.",

   "I disagree with you jyoshu.\n Here is a quote from HL Mencken on the inherent antagonism between religion and science. I think he nails it. (with apologies to chiropractors)\n \n \nThe effort to reconcile science and religion is almost always made, not by theologians, but by scientists unable to shake off altogether the piety absorbed with their mothers' milk. The theologians, with no such dualism addling their wits, are smart enough to see that the two things are implacably and eternally antagonistic, and that any attempt to thrust them into one bag is bound to result in one swallowing the other. The scientists who undertake this miscegenation always end by succumbing to religion; after a Millikan has been discoursing five minutes it becomes apparent that he is speaking in the character of a Christian Sunday-school scholar, not of a scientist. The essence of science is that it is always willing to abandon a given idea, however fundamental it may seem to be, for a better one; the essence of theology is that it holds its truths to be eternal and immutable. To be sure, theology is always yielding a little to the progress of knowledge, and only a Holy Roller in the mountains of Tennessee would dare to preach today what the popes preached in the Thirteenth Century, but this yielding is always done grudgingly, and thus lingers a good while behind the event. So far as I am aware even the most liberal theologian of today still gags at scientific concepts that were already commonplaces in my schooldays.\n \n Thus such a thing as a truly enlightened Christian is hard to imagine. Either he is enlightened or he is Christian, and the louder he protests that he is for former the more apparent it becomes that he is really the latter. A Catholic priest who devotes himself to seismology or some other such safe science may become a competent technician and hence a useful man, but it is ridiculous to call him a scientist so long as he still believes in the virgin birth, the atonement or transubstantiation. It is, to be sure, possible to imagine any of these dogmas being true, but only at the cost of heaving all science overboard as rubbish. The priest's reasons for believing in them is not only not scientific; it is violently anti-scientific. Here he is exactly on all fours with a believer in fortune-telling, Christian Science or chiropractic.\n \n \n",

Science and religion are not merely \"separate magisteria\" as Gould refers to, because they conflict. Again, your example of science and art* make no sense, as they do not conflict in the least. They both can be embraced without sacrificing the intellectual honestly of the other. Subjectivity is also perfectly compatible with science. Have you never heard of qualitative research? You can approach any topic BOTH subjectively and objectively. I agree with you that belief in God has nothing to do with understanding science, but the thought processes that allow you to do one, must be altered to allow the other. Certainly they are different topics, but that is not the same as changing you thinking in order to address each one. Cooking and astronony are very different and have little overlap in content, but one's approach to understanding either doesn't take different thought processes. You gotta change you brain to accept your religion.\n \n \n * Why \"abstract\" art? All art/esthetics relies on subjectivity, even representational art.",
