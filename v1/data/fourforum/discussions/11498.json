Mars has been fairly exhaustively mapped from orbit and any such features would have been clearly visible.\n \nthere are seas and rivers,\n\n There's some evidence of brief eruptions or flows of something, but again, there are no seas or rivers. There may well once have been, but no more.\n \nVenus has stopped its axial rotation, and has undergone many serious changes concerning its atmosphere which became some thick smoke and mixture of gases, in addition to the increase in the temperature of the day-side that is continuously facing the Sun, and the extreme coldness and freezing of the other night-side; this has led to the extermination of life upon Venus.\n\n This is more or less entirely wrong. Venus has not stopped its axial rotation, and the temperature on the night and day sides are pretty much the same.\n \nAnd all such circumstances had led to the extermination of life upon Mercury.\n\n Assuming, of course, life arose there in the first place.\n \nBut the case is different for Mars: its atmosphere is clear, it includes the cloud drifted by the wind, there is the alternation of the night and day, and seasons, and the polar regions of Mars include water in the form of ice. \n\n True, but misleading. The polar regions of Mars also include frozen carbon dioxide, it's that cold. The atmosphere is thin and extremely oxygen-poor. It would not be possible for something with, say, a brain (with all its attendant energy needs) to survive there.\n \nIf it was true that the atmosphere of Mars is so thin as do they say, then how could it bear the cirrus cloud (with the ice crystals at some high altitude) there on Mars - like that on Earth? And the wind came to drift it as it is on Earth.\n\n The question is moot because the atmospheric pressure and composition has been directly measured by martian landers.

Everest. \n You can see maps of the topography of Mars at the following link: http://ssed.gsfc.nasa.gov/tharsis/global_paper.html \"\n \n Therefore, all these mountains are taller than Mt. Everest, which may give an idea that Mars is in fact larger than Earth.\n \n The other thing is that their knowledge about Mars mountains is obviously defective: because where are the mountains less than Mt. Everest?\n \n Moreover, the tops of these mountains are covered by ice, then will not this ice !sublimate! as do they claim, specially if the atmosphere of Mars is allegedly thin? And how does such ice accumulate again?\n \n On Earth, the ice and rain will percolate in the ground and will come out in the form of water-springs on the slopes of the mountains and in the valleys in between them, and the streams of water will form tributaries and these will form the rivers that will flow from the mountains to the lower planes. \n \n Had they searched in the mountainous regions of Mars, they might have found water-springs, water-springs, and rivers in the valleys between these mountains and the plains below such mountains. \n \n But their search has been almost in the desert regions and the polar regions, which are almost without life. That is because their landing on the plain lands is easier than their landing on the mountainous regions.\n \n Moreover, if they use some sound records, they might discover some sounds like the cry of some birds and animals or other sounds. There is some set to record the sounds, but it has not been in use on Phoenix.\n \n \u0095 On Earth, their advanced technology enabled them to view the detailed features of the land and towns and may be people walking in the streets; but on Mars, it seems that such technology has been difficult to apply, and moreover, they descended their tools quickly, and cannot fly on some low or medium height to have better viewing of the surface features.\n \n Now see this link about an image of the Inka City, by Mariner 9\n http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/image/planetary/mars/mr9_inca_city.jpg \n \n And this is another image of this Inka City by, Viking 2\n http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/image/planetary/mars/f421b64.jpg\n \n Then they attributed such features to the effect of winds! How can winds do such straight lines as seen from very high altitudes?\n \n \u0095 All this indicates that their knowledge about Mars is defective, and nobody can rule out the possibility of the existence of people on Mars. And the claim, of some that they have viewed all the surface of Mars and drawn some precise maps, such claim is not precisely correct. \n \n http://universeandquran.site.io/#The_planets_Are_Inhabited_\n \n An anticipated meeting between the inhabitants of Earth and the inhabitants of some other planets :\n \n http://universeandquran.site.io/new_page_2.htm#An_Anticipated_Meeting_\n \n \n eanassir\n http://universeandquran.site.io\n\n \n \n Dude, are you for real?

   "Ok, let's go through the page you keep linking to step by step. Bear with me; this may take a little time.\n \nKnow, then, that the cause of the gravity is the heat, and the cause of the heat is the movement. This may be explained by this test:\n \n Take a large piece of amber or sandarac [or plastic] or other things with similar properties, and start to rub it continuously with a piece of wool, you will find that it has become hot because of the successive movements, then put it on a small piece of straw, you will see that piece attract the straw; because that piece [of amber or plastic] has got a gravitational force, because of the heat obtained from the rubbing.\n\n This can very easily be shown to be false.\n \n First of all, try putting the same amber or plastic in boiling hot water and removing it. You will see that despite the heat of the piece of amber or plastic (which is much greater than you obtain via rubbing), it does not attract other objects.\n \n This is because it is the static electric charge produced by the rubbing, and not the heat, causing the attraction. Try rubbing a balloon on your hair: it will stick to the ceiling or wall for some considerable time, long after the small amount of heat generated has dissipated.\n \n Thus we establish that the founding principle upon which the rest of your model is based is in error.\n \n1- Take a pot, put some water in it and heat it till boiling, then pour the water into another pot containing cold water. Put your hand into it and you will find the hot water rising above the cold water; that is because the gravity [of the earth] influences the cold more than the hot object.\n\n This is incorrect. Hot water is not lighter than cold water, it is merely less dense (the same quantity of mass occupying a larger volume). It is this difference in density that causes the hot water to float above the cold.\n \n Direct proof that you are wrong: take an ice cube and place it in water. You will observe that it floats, contradicting your claim that it should sink because it is colder. Now fill a plastic bottle to the brim with water and place it in the freezer without the cap on. You will see that when it freezes the ice pushes up out of the bottle: it gets larger. Since the amount of water in the bottle has not changed, this shows that ice is less dense than water.\n \n The same explanation holds true for water vapour, rain, and the hot gases rising from a fire. Smoke particles are, like sand in a sandstorm, carried along by the movement of the hot gases as they rise; they are not themselves ever lighter than air.\n \n Again, the observation is that your founding principle is in error.\n \nThe Repelling Force: As much as the attracting object increases its speed of rotation, the more the objects attracted to it will increase their distance from it. And the more this speed of rotation decreases, the more the attracted object will get near to it. Suppose that the attracting object stopped its rotation around its axis, then the attracted object approaches to it until it sticks [and unites] with it, on the condition that it should not be without heat; because the object does not stop its rotation around itself unless its core heat will finish. \n \n In summary, the distance of the planets from the sun is because of the rotation of the sun around its axis.\n\n Once again, this is demonstrably false. Man-made satellites orbit the earth at many different distances and in radically different orbits, despite the earth only having one fixed rotational spin. For instance, at one particular height above the earth, satellites follow a geosynchronous orbit around the equator, orbiting the earth in the same period of time as the earth itself rotates, thus appearing to stand still. At other heights, satellites orbit faster or slower. Many satellites do not have equatorial orbits: some are tilted right up so as to pass over the poles of the earth. Clearly, the rotation of the earth has nothing whatsoever to do with the distance at which objects orbit it.\n \nWhile the second reason for that is that as much as the attracted object is cold, the gravity will affect it more, so it will get near to the attracting object by gravity and vice versa. \n\n Again, clearly false. The aforementioned satellites are not different in temperature. Nor is their size or mass correlated to the distance at which they orbit.\n \n This is an experiment to prove my words: Take three balls of wood, different in volume, and tie each one by an elastic thread, and let the threads be equal in size and elasticity, then tie the other end of each thread to a ring, and put these rings in your index finger, and move your hand in a way that makes the balls revolve around your index finger, and go on moving your hand then you will see the large ball start to get farther from your index finger, while the smaller will be the nearest to your finger, while the medium ball will be middle in its distance, and on this basis the planet will be nearer or farther from the sun.\n\n Your experiment is meaningless, and here's why: \n \n Take a piece of elastic between your fingers and stretch it. You will notice that the effort required increases the further the elastic is stretched. The force of gravity, on the other hand, decreases with distance. Thus your use of elastic bands to simulate gravity is entirely incorrect.\n \nE.g. the human body in which the presence of heat indicates that he is alive; the cause of this heat is the blood circulation inside it. While coldness of the human body indicates his death, and the reason of such coldness is the cessation of the blood circulation. \n\n This simply isn't true. The body's heat comes from chemical reactions, not the circulation of blood.\n \n [ The mistake of Astronomers about Moon ] \n \n About the claim of astronomers that \"it completes its rotation around itself in the same time as it completes its revolution around the Earth\"; this is not correct, and does not rely on a sound base. [See the picture below, of 'a father playing with his child', and its explanation. Moon revolves around Earth, but does not rotate around itself.] \n\n This too is very easily shown to be wrong.\n \n Proof: Imagine what the child sees over her father's shoulder as she is spun around. She sees the whole world spinning around her. Now imagine this takes place on a clear night - now she can see the whole universe spinning around her. For this to be true, either she is spinning, or the entire universe has started to spin. Clearly it is she that is rotating.\n \n Further proof: Take a length of wood or similar item - not a child - and spin around holding on to it, taking care to ensure that it remains always pointing at you. Now let go. You will see the object fly away, continuing to spin about its own axis, until it lands on the ground.\n \nThe appearance of the Earth from the surface of the Moon is just like the appearance of the Moon from the Earth, and no difference between the two. So, as we see the Moon, likewise we shall see the Earth as a crescent one time, and as a full moon another time, but the difference between the two is that the Moon appears to be small in size, while the Earth appears fifty times larger than it. \n\n A small point in the grand scheme of things, but earth does not appear fifty times larger than the moon, only 4 times larger. The moon is 1/50th the volume of earth, not 1/50th the diameter.\n [QUOTE] The volume of Venus was two-thirds that of the Earth, but later it shrunk, so that its volume becomes somewhat smaller. It was completing its rotation around itself in a period of 16 hours, so that its day was 8 hours, so was its night. But Venus stopped its axial rotation, and now it does not rotate around its axis; therefore, the day and night of Venus have become everlasting, and they do not succeed each other, because of the depletion of its internal heat, and because heat is the reason for the rotation of an object around itself.[QUOTE]\n This is observably incorrect. Venus rotates around its own axis once every 243 (earth) days and orbits the sun once every 224 (earth) days.\n \nthe Sun may draw him by its gravity so he will die because or its rays [or heat]; that is because Venus is devoid of gravity, \n\n Demonstrably false: we have put satellites into orbit around Venus, and used it to gravitationally sling-shot other spacecraft out into the solar system. This would not be possible if Venus had no gravity.\n \nand because of being near to the Sun. The traveler to Venus, then, will find towns, houses, clubs and shops, but will not see anyone dwelling therein; he will see furniture and property, but will not see any owner of them; he will see rivers but without water; and trees but they have been burnt by the Sun heat. \n\n No, he really, really won't :) The surface temperature of Venus - day and night - is sufficient to melt lead. What you are describing is a complete fantasy.\n \n Mars is larger than Earth by less than two times; it completes its rotation around itself in a period of about 44 hours. Therefore, its day is 22 hours, and so is its night, and its year equals about two of our years.\n\n Apart from the length of the martian year, all of this is completely wrong.\n \n Mars is considerably smaller than Earth. It rotates in 24 hours 39 minutes, not 44 hours.\n \n Proof that you are wrong about the size of Mars: we know how far away it is, and from that information and its apparent size we can deduce its actual size. We know we've got that information correct because we have successfully delivered landers and orbiters to Mars, something we could not possibly do if we were wrong about its orbit and size.\n \nMars is inhabited and contains plant, trees, animals, human beings, mountains, rivers, seas and other things.\n\n From that list, only 'mountains' and 'other things' are actually true. There are no vegetation, no trees, no human beings, no rivers, no seas. We know this for a fact because we have observed the whole surface of the planet in great detail and measured its atmosphere and temperature.\n \nI say that the Asteroids are not small planets, but are satellites of the terrestrial planets, just like the meteorites and moons. The asteroid, that completes its revolution around the sun in a short period, is a satellite of Mars; whereas that which completes it in a longer period is a satellite of Jupiter. Or they may be some flaming objects just like the comets. If they were some terrestrial planets, then they should be [very] near to the sun; because of their small volumes, according to the rule of the pulling force and the repelling force. [See also \"The mistake of Astronomers about the Asteroids\" just before the subject of 'Formation of the Planets'.] \n\n You can say what you like, but you're clearly wrong. The orbits of many asteroids have been traced, and they go around the sun, not Mars or Jupiter. This is one more indication that your 'rule' about the pulling force is flat-out wrong.\n \nThese meteorites revolve with the Earth from right to left, just like the revolution of the Moon. The big ones among them contain rain water and snow; for they are nearer to the Earth than they are to the Moon. On them there are some plants; and some of the small animals live there which are not much harmed by coldness like frogs, fish and something like that.\n\n Wrong again, unfortunately. No meteorite has an atmosphere, let alone one capable of supporting terrestrial life. Amino acids have been found, but that's a long way from fish and frogs :)\n \nBut most of the mountains are due to falling of meteorites upon the Earth\n\n If you count the rims of the craters they form, then sure, some mountains could be said to result from the falling of meteorites. But it's utterly, utterly false to say that most mountains are the result of meteorites falling. Tectonic movement is responsible for mountain ranges.\n \n I think that more or less covers most of the errors on that page; I'll get to the other pages ASAP.\n \n I understand that you might hold the author of this work in high esteem, but the plain and simple fact is that he was clearly, demonstrably wrong concerning a vast swathe of fundamental physics. It's a terrific read, but its scientific value is negligable.",

Rather, they benefit from the accretion of information and theories that have withstood rigorous testing. Upon that foundation each generation can reach a little higher than before.\n \n The ideas presented on your webpage are not in any way stupid. But they are wrong. There is no shame in that.\n \n \nE.g. seeing the water vapor ascend up, you think because it is less in specific gravity or lighter than the surrounding air; here you may be right, \n \n and another explanation may be also correct: the water vapor is hot; then you say: because it is hot, it has become lighter and so it ascended up. \n \n But explaining it in another way: like the repelling between the hot vapor and the hot Earth may be more correct; I mean it is an observation: you explained it in this way to which you have been familiar because you studied it in your secondary school, college and may be your post-graduate studies until it became like unquestionable, and you think any other explanation is wrong.\n\n No, I choose one explanation over the other because it accords consistently with reality, while the other does not.\n \n For instance: inflate a balloon and put it in the fridge or freezer. When you lift it out, it will have substantially deflated, and will slowly re-inflate as the air inside warms up. No air is leaving or entering the balloon, but the volume is changing - which means it is becoming less dense. And it is this change in density which explains the rising and falling of liquids and vapour. But a change in temperature also seems to be involved - so is it the temperature, or the density that is really responsible?\n \n Ice provides us with an answer. As water cools to form ice, it expands. The same amount of matter in a larger space = less density. So here we have our decisive test: if ice sinks in water then temperature is consistently linked to the rise and fall of materials, and the link with density is broken. But if ice floats, then density is consistently linked to the rise and fall of materials, and the link with temperature is broken.\n \nMoon has no water and no life on it; he said this 60 years ago, when astronomers were guessing and many thought there are intelligent beings on Moon.\n\n I don't think that's true, but in any case - so what? He was right about the moon, and wrong about Mars.\n \n He is, for instance, absolutely definitely wrong about mars being bigger than earth. Consider:\n \n 1) We know the orbits of the planets accurately enough to allow us to plot complex gravitational slingshot routes through the solar system for our spacecraft. If we were wrong about this, none of them would reach their destinations. Agree?\n \n 2) We therefore know the distance to mars at any given time. And we can directly measure its apparent size (the amount of sky it covers), from which two pieces of information we can calculate its actual size.\n \n 3) If mars were bigger than earth, then the orbit we put our martian satellites into would have smashed them into the surface.\n \n Again, I don't say these things to disparage this man's work. There is no shame in taking a vigorous philosophical interest in the world around you. I don't, for instance, think that Aristotle or Ptolemy were stupid for thinking that the sun and other planets revolved around the earth - that is after all what it looks like is happening. But they were, in the end, wrong - as is much of the material on your site - and for the same reason: they did not have certain vital information at their disposal.\n \n I hope you'll take this critique in the spirit in which it is intended.

   "\n For instance: inflate a balloon and put it in the fridge or freezer. When you lift it out, it will have substantially deflated, and will slowly re-inflate as the air inside warms up. No air is leaving or entering the balloon, but the volume is changing - which means it is becoming less dense. And it is this change in density which explains the rising and falling of liquids and vapour. But a change in temperature also seems to be involved - so is it the temperature, or the density that is really responsible?\n \n Ice provides us with an answer.

I told you that several posts ago. Remember? You were saying it was because of the temperature, and I said it was because of the lower density (same mass, larger volume) of ice compared to water?\n \n All you're doing is repeating back to me what I already said - so thanks for agreeing with me, if in a slightly roundabout way.\n \nIt is not like this; the spaceship will not be smashed at least sometimes due to some practical experiments, and their spaceship will have some orbit around Mars; other times, the spaceships were smashed.\n\n Wrong again, unfortunately. One orbiter was lost because the assembly team used the wrong units of measurement during construction, but the rest successfully attained orbit. The only ones that crashed were actually trying to land, and were doing so from a successful orbital insertion. There is no indication that our understanding of the martian orbit is in error.\n \n I don't think you appreciate just how wrong we'd have to be about Mars's orbit for you to be right. You say Mars is bigger than the Earth, whereas every single measurement we can make shows it to be about half the size, 4217 miles in diameter.\n \n Imagine you're looking at Mars through a telescope during its closest approach to Earth, which according to our understanding of its orbit was about 54,000,000 miles. If you're right and Mars is over twice the size we think it is, it would have to be over twice as far away in order to look the size it does through your telescope. That means anything we tried to put into orbit around mars would miss by at least 60,000,000 miles. Every single spacecraft we ever sent to mars would have missed by over 60,000,000 miles if you were right.\n \n I mentioned orbiters smashing into the surface because - assuming that by blind luck we DID manage to get something into orbit - a double-size Mars would have far more gravity than it does, and our spacecrafts' speed would be too low to stay in orbit.\n \n You need to face up to reality: Mars is smaller than Earth. That is never, ever going to change. Swinging balls around your finger on lengths of elastic proves nothing, because gravity is not like elastic.\n \n\"A fork-like conductivity probe has sensed humidity rising and falling beside NASA's Phoenix Mars Lander\", although they say that the ground is still dry!\n What is this humidity? Is it some mild rain or drizzle or like on Earth: some rain will evaporate before reaching the ground ?\n\n No, it's humidity. Not rain or drizzle.

Using simple trigonometry, we can calculate that for Mars to be 54,000,000 miles away and cover 16/3600ths of a degree of sky, it would have to be about 4200 miles across - which is almost exactly what NASA estimates the diameter of Mars to be:\n \n 54,000,000 x Sin(16/3600) = 4188\n \n With me so far? Ok. Now, you claim that Mars is over twice as big as NASA thinks. Since the visible size of Mars is not in doubt, the only other variable is the distance. If you think Mars is 9000 miles across, for instance, slightly bigger than Earth, the above equation becomes something like this:\n \n ? x Sin(16/3600) = 9000\n \n And when we do the math, we find the new distance must be around 116,023,953. If you're right about the size of Mars, NASA would miss it by over 60,000,000 miles every time they sent a probe.\n \n You can't have it both ways, eanassir.

   "Major apologies to all for getting my figures mixed up in the previous post.

Look again at the maths:\n \n Diameter = Sin(Angle) x Distance.\n \n To make Mars bigger than Earth you would have to more than double the diameter, which would mean either doubling the distance, doubling the sine of the angle (which for small angles effectively means doubling the angle), or a combination of the two. The smallest error margin that could make mars twice the size would be 41% on both the angle and the distance.\n \n For example, if the measured distance were 10% wrong (which is already impossible because the martian landers and orbiters would never have got there) AND the angle measured from earth were 10% wrong (which is equally absurd since it's a trivial measurement to make, no harder than measuring a piece of paper with a ruler), that would still only make Mars 20% bigger, not the 100%+ bigger you require.\n \n And in any case, as I've already pointed out, the Mariner probes went out there for the express purpose of precisely establishing the size and mass of Mars, in order that subsequent missions could orbit or land upon the planet.\n \n I'm really not kidding; there's no way you can be right about this :)",

The very, very thin atmosphere which has been subsequently confirmed over and over again from the surface.\n \n\n \n Tell me why you don't consider these points seriously, and many others that are coming every day!\n I asked which Mariner and when and how, but no answer!\n The thin atmosphere that you speak about is carrying the cloud with the dust at more altitude than that of the Earth; for this reason the afterglow lasts longer.\n \n \n \n\n Mars has been observed and measured literally millions of times over by professionals and amateurs alike. Not one of them has ever said 'Hey, you know - Mars looks twice as big as it should - what's up with that?'. We've sent probes past it, analysed the composition of the crust and mantle and atmosphere, and still nobody has said 'Hang on, it's over twice as big as we thought. Our probes were out of contact with Earth for twice as long as expected!\" We've put spacecraft into precisely calculated orbits around it, landed machines on it even, without ever bumping up against the inconvenience of it being over twice as big as we thought. We can map images from the whole planet onto a 4200mile scale sphere without having loads left over. Yet you prefer to believe the work of someone who themselves never studied Mars directly at all, who simply thought that the planets ought to be in size order, and satisfied himself to that effect using balls and elastic. Don't you think that's a little... silly?\n \n\n \n This is not a scientific way of deduction.\n \n \n\n Now, I have a straightforward balls-related challenge for you. I want you to take two spheres of different size - say a tennis ball and a ping-pong ball - and I want you to position them so that they satisfy the following criteria simultaneously:\n \n 1. They look the same size to you. This represents the fact that Mars looks the same size to you as it does to NASA, yet you believe it to be over twice the actual size.\n 2. They are the same distance away from you. This represents the fact that you agree with NASA how far away Mars is.\n \n You've claimed this is possible, so explain how!\n\n \n This experiment is not relevant; to me Mars is bigger, to NASA (till now) it is smaller.:)\n http://universeandquran.741.com/../My%20Webs/new_page_2.htm#Traveling to Mars\n \n http://universeandquran.741.com/../My%20Webs/new_page_2.htm#Emigration to Mars\n \n \n \n eanassir\n http://universeandquran.741.com",

I highly recommend you read the entirety of the book, and consider whether it's possible for every single one of these people - not to mention tens of thousands of amateurs - observing and measuring Mars night in and night out for years, to have failed to notice that it looks twice as big as it should. \n \n Add to that the fact we have satellites orbiting Mars right now, and the diameter of their orbit is smaller than you claim the planet to be.

   "<trigonometric method proven<No objection.\n\n Then the point is made. You've agreed that we know the correct distance to Mars at any given time, and the visible size may be measured by anyone with a telescope. Thus we know Mars is smaller than Earth.\n \nThese are some of your assertions, to which you give a non-relevant example.\n\n It's perfectly relevant. You are using the error margin in our measurements of Mars to wrongly infer that your belief that it is larger than Earth might be correct.\n \nDon't be too optimistic.\n\n I don't need to be optimistic at all. If spacecraft were only now on their way to Mars to orbit or land upon it for the first time, I would be optimistic that our remote measurements of it were accurate. But the fact is those spacecraft are there right now, both in orbit and safely landed upon the surface, after 1) the trajectories calculated for orbiting a 4,200 mile diameter planet, 2) aerobraking manoeuvres and 3) descent shielding - the latter two designed for the thin Martian atmosphere - all worked. There is no requirement for optimism because all the empirical tests for the size, mass, and atmospheric density of Mars have been passed.\n \nWhat's this? And once again we return to your \"nonsense\".\n\n Precisely: inferring that a blue whale is smaller than a dolphin from the size of the prey it eats is nonsense. Just as it is nonsense to infer that Mars is bigger than Earth because it spins more slowly, has a longer sunset, and a couple of taller mountains.\n \nThis is not enough; the stratosphere has some stable sublayers to which it has specific weights of the constituent gases; (about which their knowledge is defective); because no wind there to mix these gases, while in the troposphere below the turbulance will mix the gases and so they will not be separated into distinctive layers (contrary to the layers above: from the stratosphere and above.)\n\n So what? The layering or trace element composition of the stratosphere - the analysis of which is difficult purely because of its distance from the ground - is not and has never been the issue. The issue is the surface pressure and composition of the Martian atmosphere, directly measured on an ongoing moment-by-moment basis by the landers.\n \nAnticipate my post about the ping-pong ball and the tennis ball. :)\n\n Eagerly :)\n \nIt is not so correct that by subtraction of the constituents of the upper from the lower that you will reach to some precize results; some constituents are shared between the upper and lower layers as do they claim.\n\n Doesn't matter. Referring back to the diagram, the uppermost layer can be directly analysed, yes? Moving downward, the next layer will exhibit a geometrically calculable fraction of the uppermost layer's characteristics, plus its own - and so on down to the surface. The results thus obtained were confirmed by direct measurement during the Pathfinder lander's descent.\n \nWhile according to the Lander, we don't know about their exact method of estimating the constituents of the air at the surface level; about the pressure they may give good results, but about the constituents of the air, I don't know for certain.\n\n If the pressure is a sound result, that alone proves there are no people on Mars. The atmospheric pressure is only 0.7% that at Earth's surface.

   "Why shouldn't they re-estimate the measurements from the start?\n\n They have, many many times over the last hundred years. The apparent size of Mars is readily ascertained by looking at it. The arc it subtends - its visible size - is undoubtedly directly measured hundreds if not thousands of times every year by amateur astronomers alone, who do that sort of thing for fun. What you're saying is that all of them, every single time, are getting it massively wrong - based on the musings of a man who has never performed that measurement himself.\n \n Not only that, but you're saying that the satellites NASA put into 4,500mile diameter orbits around Mars are actually orbiting under the ground through solid rock. That's what must be happening, because you think the planet is bigger than their orbit.\n \nIs our distance from our stratosphere farther or is our distacne from Mars? So in case they are unable to estimate precizely such constituents of the Earth atmosphere, then how could they do that on Mars?\n\n Still not relevant, eanassir. The mars landers descended through the martian atmosphere while measuring it. Their distance to it was zero. And they're still there, day after day, confirming by direct measurement and by their very success as landers, which depended upon us knowing the atmospheric pressure correctly, that you are wrong about the Martian atmosphere's composition.\n \nIn addition, using the spectrometer will not enable us to know the concentration of such gases and sublayers, but only to some extent their existence there in the atmosphere. :)\n\n Incorrect. Wishing that this were true does not make it so.\n \nThese may easily be proved not correct, in the near future. \n\n The instruments are right there, on Mars, taking the measurements day after day. Remote spectrographic analysis agrees with those results. It is deeply, deeply unscientific to cling to a nonexistent hope that one day magic will intervene and make you right.\n \nMoreover, human beings have been adapted to various circumstances: Eskimo living in the frozen regions; the Africans living in the hot forests; the Tibetean living in high altitudes...etc.\n\n Irrelevant again, unfortunately.

The Earth will stop its axial rotation because of the depletion of its internal heat by time, due to the eruption of volcanoes and the continous heat loss by radiation, until its core will become cold and it will then stop spinning around itself.\n \n \n \n\n How in the heck does rotation indicate a cessation of rotation?

   "MERCURY\n \n Rotation\n \n As Mercury moves around the sun, it rotates on its axis, an imaginary line that runs through its center. The planet rotates once about every 59 Earth days -- a rotation slower than that of any other planet except Venus. As a result of the planet's slow rotation on its axis and rapid movement around the sun, a day on Mercury -- that is, the interval between one sunrise and the next -- lasts 176 Earth days. \n \n Until the mid-1960's, astronomers believed that Mercury rotated once every 88 Earth days, the same time the planet takes to go around the sun. If Mercury did this, one side of the planet would always face the sun, and the other side would always be dark. However, radar studies conducted in 1965 showed that the planet rotates once in about 59 days.\n \n VENUS\n \n Rotation\n \n As Venus travels around the sun, it rotates very slowly on its axis, an imaginary line drawn through its center. Venus's axis is not perpendicular (at an angle of 90\u00a1) to the planet's path around the sun. The axis tilts at an angle of approximately 178\u00a1 from the perpendicular position. Unlike the Earth, Venus does not rotate in the same direction in which it travels around the sun. Rather, Venus rotates in the retrograde (opposite) direction and spins around once every 243 Earth days. \n \n \n Sorry, eanassir, you are just plain wrong.\n \n However, if you feel that you can, in any way, prove your point, I would suggest you contact NASA, talk to them about any evidence you have, and become a world famous astrophysicist.

NASA can put a spacecraft in orbit around or upon the surface of Mars based on calculations in which Mars is around 4,200 miles in diameter with a thin wisp of an atmosphere - which proves that those figures are correct.\n \n\n \n \n It is not essential to know the size of Mars in order to send their probe to it; they know the distance, they go there, and when they reach there they jump with their probes on it :) ; the practical experiences will alleviate the need for their defective theories and data. \n \n eanassir\n http://universeandquran.741.com",

   "MERCURY\n \n Rotation\n \n As Mercury moves around the sun, it rotates on its axis, an imaginary line that runs through its center. The planet rotates once about every 59 Earth days -- a rotation slower than that of any other planet except Venus. As a result of the planet's slow rotation on its axis and rapid movement around the sun, a day on Mercury -- that is, the interval between one sunrise and the next -- lasts 176 Earth days. \n \n Until the mid-1960's, astronomers believed that Mercury rotated once every 88 Earth days, the same time the planet takes to go around the sun. If Mercury did this, one side of the planet would always face the sun, and the other side would always be dark. However, radar studies conducted in 1965 showed that the planet rotates once in about 59 days.\n \n VENUS\n \n Rotation\n \n As Venus travels around the sun, it rotates very slowly on its axis, an imaginary line drawn through its center. Venus's axis is not perpendicular (at an angle of 90\u00a1) to the planet's path around the sun. The axis tilts at an angle of approximately 178\u00a1 from the perpendicular position. Unlike the Earth, Venus does not rotate in the same direction in which it travels around the sun. Rather, Venus rotates in the retrograde (opposite) direction and spins around once every 243 Earth days. \n \n \n Sorry, eanassir, you are just plain wrong.\n \n However, if you feel that you can, in any way, prove your point, I would suggest you contact NASA, talk to them about any evidence you have, and become a world famous astrophysicist. If you can prove that no-one has got it right up until you came along to put them right, then your notoriety will be incredible.\n \n Unfortunately, as it stand, you are just incredible (ie not credible).\n \n Smiley\n\n \n I know they say so; and you and Sinjin and Peeling and others quote their words. \n \n But the incredible thing is to take such explanations without asking why is this bizarre way of movement of both Mercury and Venus? \n And why are these two planets different from the rest of planets? \n Why is their day so long? \n And why does Venus appear to move in retrograde manner (apparently)?\n And what is the reason behind such serious changes in the atmosphere and the manifestation of the surface and the thick cloud? \n \n Then if you contemplate such findings, you may give preponderance to our words and explanations.\n \n \n eanassir\n http://universeandquran.741.com",

Then where did all this water go, in spite of that it is still present on the tremendous areas of the two poles and on the mountains in the form of snow.\n This is not logical, and the go after some bizzarre ( as you have expressed) explanations like the CO2 ice, why don't they see the truth before them, but that God has confounded them, because of their sins of homosexuality and adultey in addition to their atheism and associating Jesus with God in their worship.\n So in spite of their scientific achievements, they have not yet reached to proving the existence of life and liquid water there, and they went to improper sites and used wrong programs of taking the images, and they have missed the truth; their confusion is so obvious, like how the first discoverers went here and there bewildered until God guided them.\n \n \n\n When everyone who has ever studied Mars has to be fundamentally wrong about it in almost every respect in order for one man who never studied Mars to be right - doesn't that give you even the slightest pause?\n \n\n \n That man, the inspired interpreter of the Quran and the Bible, did not even graduate at any primary school; he only knew reading and writing Arabic.\n But I did not say they are wrong in every respect about Mars: only some measurements and data and findings and explanations about the size, the existence of water (which only they have discovered it in the ice, cloud and fog and now in clay! also) While he said this 60 years ago, exactly at 1947, and he said there is life on Mars and some other planets, in the form of plant, animal and man (and genies or demons also -living in the gaseous layers of the sky of each planet)\n \n \n\n Gravity, for a start. But since we disagree about how that works, I think there's little point broadening our discussion at this stage.\n \n\n \n Now, this is your evasion: it is difficult for you to say: We don't know; while this sentence is the key of all the science and knowledge; yes they don't know why the planets are arranged around the sun, and what are the rules governing their positions around the sun; and there came this man who only could read and write Arabic to explain to us in his simple, yet reasonable, explanation: why the planets are arranged around the sun in their particular orbits.\n http://universeandquran.741.com/My%20Webs/new_page_3.htm#A%20Rule%20for%20Objects\n A rule for objects\n \n \n\n But they're following an orbit of around 4,500 miles diameter. That is what they were designed to do, that's what they are doing, as their telemetry confirms. You say Mars is 8,000 miles across. Therefore they must be orbiting under the ground. That's a remarkable feat even for NASA, especially considering they weren't even trying. \n\n \n If they orbit at 4,500 miles diameter, then what will the diameter of Mars be then? Two meters?\n \n \n eanassir\n http://universeandquran.741.com",

   "This is indeed a good lecture and exercise; your lectures and excercises are excellent; but do not stick to them, but have more horizones of cotemplation; because such restrictions to your lectures and dictating will restrict you and astronomers from seeing many new and valuable things and from discovering many mistakes.\n\n You keep talking about astronomers 'making mistakes', but where is the potential for error?\n \n In the exercise above, there are a finite number of variables:\n \n 1. The length of the stick used for callibration.\n 2. The distance of the stick used for callibration.\n 3. The distance of the planet being measured.\n \n The magnification of the telescope is irrelevant, because whatever it may be it will equally magnify the stick and the planet, leading to the same result.\n \n 1. and 2. are directly measurable, and you've already agreed that we know 3. So where's the mistake? Which of those three things are thousands of astronomers consistently getting wrong by a factor of 2? Are you saying astronomers can't measure a stick? Are you saying astronomers can't measure the distance to a stick?\n \n Here's an alternative suggestion: one man who never ever studied mars himself made a mistake when he plucked a random number out of thin air and then used elastic, which has the exact opposite properties to gravity, to 'confirm' that random number.\n \nThat man, the inspired interpreter of the Quran and the Bible, did not even graduate at any primary school; he only knew reading and writing Arabic.\n\n And what he did with that knowledge was remarkable. Not right, but remarkable nonetheless. As I said before, your absurd insistence on presenting his work as correct brings shame upon him. The people you talk to, here and elsewhere, will not remember the inspirational story of an uneducated man who tried to make sense of the world around him. They will only remember your folly in repeatedly denying the blatantly obvious. They will remember your name, not his.\n \nNow, this is your evasion: it is difficult for you to say: We don't know; while this sentence is the key of all the science and knowledge; yes they don't know why the planets are arranged around the sun, and what are the rules governing their positions around the sun; and there came this man who only could read and write Arabic to explain to us in his simple, yet reasonable, explanation: why the planets are arranged around the sun in their particular orbits.\n\n And he was wrong. I'm not evading the issue, I just don't think there's any point talking about theories of planet formation when we disagree on the size of the planets that theory has to explain.\n \n \nIf they orbit at 4,500 miles diameter, then what will the diameter of Mars be then? Two meters?\n\n Er, no: 4200 miles. Why in the world would you say two metres? The significance of the 4,500 mile diameter orbit is that you can't fit one around the outside of an 8000 mile planet. Mars must be smaller than the orbit of the spacecraft, or else they're orbiting through solid rock. Take your pick!\n \n Here is some more detailed information. I've highlighted in red the parts that would have gone catastrophically wrong if Mars were 8000 miles across instead of 4200, and in green those that would have gone tits-up if they'd been wrong about the atmospheric pressure:\n \n \nUpon reaching Mars, Surveyor fired its main rocket engine for the 22-minute Mars orbit insertion (MOI) burn. This maneuver slowed the spacecraft and allowed the planet's gravity to capture it into orbit. Initially, Surveyor entered a highly elliptical orbit that took 45 hours to complete. The orbit had a periapsis of 262 km above the northern hemisphere, and an apoapsis of 54,026 km above the southern hemisphere.\n \n After orbit insertion, Surveyor performed a series of orbit changes to lower the periapsis of its orbit into the upper fringes of the Martian atmosphere at an altitude of about 110 kilometers (68 miles). During every atmospheric pass, the spacecraft slowed down by a slight amount because of atmospheric resistance. The density of the Martian atmosphere at such altitudes is comparatively low, allowing this procedure to be performed without damage to the spacecraft. This slowing caused the spacecraft to lose altitude on its next pass through the orbit's apoapsis. Surveyor used this aerobraking technique over a period of four months to lower the high point of its orbit from 54,000 kilometers to altitudes near 450 kilometers.\n \n <snip<\n \n Under the new mission plan, aerobraking occurred with the low point of the orbit at an average altitude of 120 km, as opposed to the original altitude of 110 km. This slightly higher altitude resulted in a decrease of 66 percent in terms of air resistance pressure experienced by the spacecraft. During these six months, aerobraking reduced the orbit period to between 12 and 6 hours.\n \n From May to November 1998, aerobraking was temporarily suspended to allow the orbit to drift into the proper position with respect to the Sun. Without this hiatus, 'Surveyor' would complete aerobraking with its orbit in the wrong solar orientation. In order to maximize the efficiency of the mission, these six months were devoted to collecting as much science data as possible. Data was collected between two to four times per day, at the low point of each orbit.\n \n Finally, from November 1998 to March 1999, aerobraking continued and shrank the high point of the orbit down to 450 km. At this altitude, Surveyor circled Mars once every two hours. Aerobraking was scheduled to terminate at the same time the orbit drifted into its proper position with respect to the Sun.\n\n As you can see, NASA didn't drive up to Mars and stop. You want me to believe that they spent a year and a half fine-tuning the orbit of their spacecraft without ever once noticing that the planet they had chosen to visit was twice as big and eight times as heavy as expected, and you want me to believe this on the strength of a piece of elastic. I'm sorry, but I really don't think it can support both our weight :)",

   "&#8226; The interpreter (if you read seriously what he said) did not say Mars is twice the Earth; he said Mars is about 11/2 the size of the Earth [or exactly he said the volume according to his understanding.] \n\n Perhaps I've been unclear: I have never claimed you think Mars was twice the size of Earth. Rather, you think Mars is more than twice the size everyone else thinks it is.\n \nThis is not intended to belittle NASA, Astronomers or you or anyone else; when we say the mistake of Astronomers, but only to draw attention to many wrong ideas and concepts, which have to be taken into consideration.\n\n But what are these 'wrong ideas and concepts'? As I said in my last post, that method of measuring celestial objects relies upon:\n \n 1. A stick of known length...\n 2. ...a known distance away...\n 3. ... and knowing the distance of the planet.\n \n The rest is simple, inarguable trigonometry. The answer you get will be more or less accurate depending upon the magnification used, but you're talking about every single astronomer being out by a factor of - well, I was being generous before but now you've said Mars is 1.5x bigger than earth, they have to be wrong by a factor of 3!\n \n Clearly NASA isn't wrong by a factor of 3 about the distance of Mars, or the spacecraft sent there would only get 1/3 of the way there. So where is this massive, massive error creeping in?\n \nI am not an astronomer or physicist, neither was the interpreter; but we believe according to the Quran &#8211; which is superior to their science and knowledge whatever God has given to them out of His omniscience &#8211; that there is life on the planets including Mars. \n\n There may well be life of some sort on Mars. But it's still not bigger than Earth :) And nowhere in the Quran does it say Mars is bigger than Earth. That notion was dreamed up out of a philosophical belief that the planets 'ought' to be in size order. They're clearly not, and it's not a contradiction of the Quran to observe that fact.\n \nYou are certainly more qualified than I am, but eventhough I believe that what the inspired interpreter said, was truthful and his words were correct, and the word of God is the truth and more correct than any other word.\n\n How many qualifications does it take to measure a stick? :) Remember: nowhere in the Quran is Mars described as larger than Earth, so even were we both to accept the Quran as an authority on the matter, god is not on your side here.\n \nI believe certainly that the planets are earths like our Earth, and they include water, plant, animal and man-kind created by God on such planets with the exception of Mercury and Venus whose circumstances have deteriorated.\n\n I understand that you believe this to be the case, but the copious evidence gathered thus far is stacked entirely against you.\n \nThere will be in the near future some mutual meeting between the inhabitants of the Earth and some other planets, and Mars is the most anticipated for such incidence.\n\n So long as you stretch your definition of 'inhabitants', sure :)\n \n Consider this: Mars is thought to have been warmer and wetter and far more hospitable in the past. Perhaps complex life did exist there once, but no longer. That scenario does not contradict the Quran, only your personal choice to believe that Mars is inhabited right now. Nor does Mars being smaller than Earth contradict the Quran, so it is false pride to say that you are the messenger of god's word in these matters. The same applies to every other statement on your site about the size and orbit of the planets.\n \n I personally own a telescope which uses the known orbits of the planets to position them in the centre of the eyepiece upon command. It will do this any time of day or night, any day of the year. How could it do this if Pluto really orbited Neptune? How can asteroids orbit Jupiter and Mars when they spend half their time on the other side of the sun from those planets? Not to mention that NASA is visiting asteroids based on their known orbits!\n \n None of the ideas about planets and their orbits on your site emerge from the Quran.

   "Mars is about 11/2 the size of the Earth.\n\n It's disappointing to see you retreat behind a simple restatement of belief, eanassir. I understand that you see that as the virtuous thing to do, but I wish you would reconsider, and listen to those parts of you that are crying \"I can find no fault with these methods of measuring Mars. I cannot explain how thousands of astronomers could all get it wrong by the same huge amount over hundreds of years. I cannot explain how NASA could induce a spacecraft to follow a 4,500 mile orbit around a 12,000 mile planet, or could painstakingly adjust that orbit for eighteen months using vastly incorrect calculations, and still achieve the result they desired. I cannot explain how they could be completely wrong about how gravity works, and yet still successfully launch spacecraft on elaborate gravitationally-guided trajectories covering hundreds of millions of miles.\"\n \n Of course, listening to that voice is how I make myself happy. Your mileage may vary :)\n \nThe Quran does not mention anything about Mars being bigger or smaller than Earth;\n\n Then stop invoking god as your advocate!\n \n This is something one man decided ought to be true, and you have decided to agree out of respect for him - that is all. And luckily, your error has no consequences. No spacecraft will go astray or crash because you are determined to be wrong about the size of Mars or the density of its atmosphere. Trigonometry will remain the dependable tool it has always been, impervious to your doubts. Astronomers will continue to use their metre sticks, which will remain one metre long however passionately you believe they must be three times the size (and presumably wielded by stupid giants). You are gloriously free to remain wrong in this matter to any degree you see fit, and the planets and the craft NASA sends to visit them will proceed upon their courses regardless. If you get bored, you could try believing Mars is twice or three times the size of Earth for a while instead - even nine or ten! After all, why stop at 1.5? If none of the measurements we've made can be trusted, the sky's no limit! :)\n \nThere is life on the planets in the form of plant, animal and man, according to many ayat of the Quran; and you will be proved wrong\n\n If that belief brings you contentment in your life, then it serves its purpose.
