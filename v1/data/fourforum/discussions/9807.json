They probably masturbate to those images every night. Do you?\n\n \n I pointed out once before that you might want to llok into this a little deeper. Every study I have ever seen on th ematter shows overwhelingly that gun owners are typically less fearful...they are confident in their ability to handle adverse situations. The gun banners, on the other hand, tend to be the fearful ones. They are far mroe afraid of crime.\n \n Ultimatly this makes sense. People who want guns overwhelmingly tend to want them to enable them to defend themselves. Personally, I have always noticed in life that the strong, brave people are the ones who tand and fight for themselves while whiney little chicken shits stand in line to get slaughtered. It has always been this way. Fear breeds compliance. \n \n The question is, what are YOU afraid of? Are you so stupid that you cannot handle a weapon wihtout beig a danger to yourself and others, therefore you assume that others cannot? Do you have a sadistic or psychotic streak that you assume others share and you are afraid that you could not control your compulsion to kill if you had a gun?\n \n Regardless of your personal situation, I assure you that there are plenty of sane people out there who are bright enough to handle a firearm without hurting themselves or others so stop projecting your own inadequacies, whatever they may be, on others.",

   "Here's something that the media and gun grabbers haven't told you:\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath_School_disaster\n \n And guess what, the guy didn't use a gun but instead he used dynamite.\n Crazy people that want to kill others will always find a way no matter what.\n \n Naturally the gun grabbers don't mention this particular massacre because it would contradict their position that guns, not people, are responsible for school massacres.\n\n \n I'm so glad someone (namely; you.) has posted this. It is the most deadly 'campus shooting' but not massacre. People just homologously like the two. I've seen the news channels even say it was the biggest massacre as opposed to 'shooting.'\n \n People these days have a severe thinking deficit.",

   "My point was that the media, the government and the people shouldn't start screaming at the top of their lungs that this is the biggest massacre ever to advance their own anti-gun agenda's, while at the same time omitting the fact that 80 years earlier something even worse happened.\n\n \n I have to agree with Master Shake. It requires no agenda from \"gun grabbers\" for the media to sensationalize a story, or for gov't officials to use the opportunity for their own political gain.\n \n I also think that there's a difference between a farmer having access to dynamite and a student having access to guns.",
