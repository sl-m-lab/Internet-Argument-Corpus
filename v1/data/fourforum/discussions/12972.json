   "Eight British soldiers killed in one day in Aghanistan. Bloody Hell!\n More Brits have died in Afghanistan than in Iraq\n \n Isn't ironic that in the past the Australians used to die for the British Empire and nowadays the Poms are dying in the service of the American Empire ?\n What goes around comes around. emoticon_xkill\n \n There is no network or conspiracy of terrorists around the world. Terrorists don't flock to Afghanistan to earn an MBA in terrorism.\n Bush's decisions are still costing lives of soldiers and civilians. \n This senseless slaughter that will increase in Iraq once the Americans leave will be Bush's legacy.\n History has already passed judgement on him. \n \n The war in Afghanistan is chaotic, senseless and unwinnable.\n \n We've lost sight of our goal in Afghanistan | Editorial | Comment is free | The Observer",
