What does the camps existence offer future generations apart from guilt?\n\n \n A reminder that less than a century ago, people not unlike ourselves participated in the largest organised extermination of human beings in history. It wasn't a battlefield massacre, it wasn't just a work camps for political dissidents, it was a deliberate, industrialised slaughter of human beings simply because of who they were - Jewish, gay, Gypsy, black. Europeans need reminding that this isn't something that just happens in far away places like Cambodia or Rwanda. This happened in Europe, modern industrialised Europe. It can't be explained away by cultural differences or religious fervour, this is hatred, red in tooth and claw.",
