   "Obama has squashed it.\n \n Team Obama Halts Talk of Assault Weapons Ban | Newsweek Periscope | Newsweek.com\n \n \nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton is now the second member of President Obama's cabinet to get shot down by the White House over the politically sensitive issue of assault weapons. After meeting with Mexican President Felipe Calder\u00f3n, Clinton said that reinstating the U.S. ban on assault weapons-which was passed in 1994 and expired in 2004-is one step this country could take to curb the flow of guns to Mexico's drug cartels. \"These military-style weapons don't belong on anybody's street,\" Clinton told NBC. Within hours, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs told reporters that he was unaware of \"any plans\" to push for such a ban-even though Obama had backed one during last year's campaign.\n \n Attorney General Eric Holder had a similar experience a few weeks earlier. After he endorsed a ban at a Feb. 25 press conference, Justice officials were instructed by White House aides to drop the issue, according to administration and congressional aides who asked not to be named due to political sensitivities. What's behind the shift? A budding relationship between the gun lobby and Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill. After Holder mentioned the ban, the National Rifle Association sent out action alerts to its members and bombarded Hill offices with calls. Sixty-five House Dems dashed off a letter to Holder opposing such a ban, while Speaker Nancy Pelosi-echoing the NRA's mantra on all gun-control issues-said she backed \"enforcing the laws we have now.\"\n \n NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre told NEWSWEEK that Hill Democrats have \"learned their lesson\" from 1994, when they enacted the ban and subsequently lost control of Congress. They've also learned that cozying up to the NRA can pay big dividends. Last year Democrats received 20 percent of the nearly $1.2 million that the NRA pumped into congressional campaign coffers-more than twice what it gave to Dems just six years earlier. The way things are going, this could be more than a shotgun wedding.\n",

   "Well, well, it seems that Obama is smarter than he lets on.\n \n Obama: Mexico drug war 'sowing chaos' - White House- msnbc.com\n \n \nMEXICO CITY - Acknowledging a Mexican drug war that is \"sowing chaos in our communities,\" President Barack Obama signaled Thursday he will not seek the reinstatement of a U.S. assault weapons ban but instead step up enforcement of existing laws against taking such weapons across the border.\n \n Despite a campaign promise to see the lapsed ban renewed, Obama was bowing to the reality that to do so would be unpopular in politically key U.S. states and among Republicans as well as some conservative Democrats.\n \n Mexican President Felipe Calderon, conducting an aggressive fight against drug cartels, had hoped to persuade Obama to push the reinstatement.\n \n Obama, on a swift visit here meant to bolster Calderon in his drug fight, countered the disappointment for his Mexican host with a pledge to push Congress to finally act on an inter-American weapons treaty that has languished in the Senate since 1998. He said he is asking Congress to provide money for Black Hawk helicopters and surveillance equipment Mexico has long sought for its drug war.\n \n \"We are absolutely committed to working in partnership with Mexico to make sure that we are dealing with this scourge on both sides of the border,\" Obama said after meeting with Calderon.\n \"You can't fight this war with just one hand,\" he said. \"You can't have Mexico making an effort and the United States not making an effort.\"\n \n Obama's meetings with Calderon also spanned the economic crisis, immigration and clean energy.\n \n But the escalating drug fight in Mexico, which is spilling over into the United States and alarming border communities, was the dominant topic.\n \n Calderon welcomed Obama to the presidential residence, Los Pinos, with an acknowledgment of the challenges: \"My country is immersed in a historic transformation process. We live a robust democracy, which is also plural. We're also facing firmly the costs of the struggles in order to turn Mexico into a safer country.\" \n",

The killing, Mexican authorities said, was a panorama of blood, shattered glass and torn metal that brutally showcased the firepower of Mexico's drug cartels. But that was just the warm-up.\n \n Two hours later, a small army of cartel hit men descended on a federal police office and bunkhouse in this crowded city at one of the world's busiest border crossings. None of the officers, who had recently been sent here to crush the drug gangs terrorizing the city, were killed in the hail of more than 1,200 bullets, authorities said. But police veterans understood the message delivered to the newcomers: \"Welcome to Tijuana.
