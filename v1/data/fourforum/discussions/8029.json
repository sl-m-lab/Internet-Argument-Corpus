I think a significant part of why this is such a issue over with you is that you've enough of a 'fundamentalist' opinion for it to be regarded as a serious point. Sad as it is, there are those who see pregnancy as a inevitable outcome of sex regardless of of precautions taken and that the whole concept of unwanted pregancies sort of proves their point (mainly due to something the 'sinner' doesn't want happen to them occurs). I honestly believe that its a rare point of view, but sadly a fairly vocal one (nothing sells papers like controversy). Just means you have to be more careful in expressing your point of view, just like the more left wing sides do as well, to make it clear you aren't one of the trained nutjobs the media can use to generate news out of nowhere but someone with a valid point.\n \n Here it is more a case of recognising which threads are more likely to illicite a sensible response. Apparent preaching or in some cases out right insults will not attract anyone but those wanting to ridicule you for holding poorly thought out beliefs (even if what you beleive and what you wrote are different from each other, the post itself being an attempt to sum up the debate in some way). First and foremost this is a discussion forum, the best plan is to find some way to challenge anothers belief, preferably based off something they believe (like the pro-life side and misscarriages or the pro-choice side and vegetarianism) - just stating they are wrong without looking to see what sort of things people are dicussing is just going to generate hostility and an unwillingness to debate.",

It is simply because she should accept that she made a mistake and should not be allowed to kill an unborn child just because she wasn't responsible enough to protect herself against teh possibility. How many times do I have to correcxt myself before you understand that? If this is confusing you... I will reluctantly reword my statement for the hundredth time.\n\n \n Unless this is just your opinion and you want abortion to remain safe and legal - THIS IS PUNITIVE.

Namely, I believe she is saying that, if a person committs an irresponsible act, then they have a responsibility to face the consequences of that act - not as a punishment but as a requirement of personal responsibility to face up to the consequences. For example, if you choose to drive a car and crash into someone's property, it is your requirement from personal responsibility not to run but to face the consequences (no \"hit and run\"). The negative consequences (ex. paying for the repair of that property) is not a punishment for driving. It is a requirement to face up to one's responsibilities, which arose in the first place since one was not driving carefully.

I was simply using it to illustrate a point. People who drive cars, even if they drive carefully, can still accidentally damage property. Most such property damage is not done on purpose and some of it is not even done due to irresponsible driving (ex. there might have been a slippery icy road). Nonetheless, that responsibility to others has to be faced. \n \n I agree with you that the woman who gets pregnant does not, at least in the early pregnancy, have to face the consequences of carrying that pregnancy to term. However, I think my reasoning may be different than yours. The main issue I have against Juleacatz position is that, in early pregnancy, there is no \"somebody\" existing yet to whom we owe a responsibility. If, with that car, you damage something that nobody owns, that carries no negative consequences. One has responsibility to \"someone\" not to \"something\". There is no \"someone\" yet in an early fetus.\n \n \nI disagree(obviously). Studies have proved that a new organism is created at teh moment of conception, not when the brain is formed.

An abortion is punishment for a child who did nothing wrong, but was unlucky enough to have been concieved, by accident, only to die before it was developed enough to know it.\n\n The very concept of \"innocence\" assumes a mental existence. For example, an entity without a mental existence, such as a rock or tree, cannot be called \"innocent\". Before having a mental existence, there is no \"someone\" there to empathize with. I would probably agree with a lot of your stance against late-term abortions (where such mental existence might be possible), but have never heard any convincing arguements against early-term abortions.",

I have no doubt that we will all continue to argue and vote our conscience, but I believe that a lot could be accomplished if we genuinely try to understand the other's point of view.\n\n Oh yeah!

   "Almost everything we humans eat, drink, slather on our skins or otherwise consume was (or is) a living organism at one time. So what? If sentient life was the basis of this argument, then I'd expect you all to be vegetarians as pigs are quite intelligent (certainly more so than unborn human children) and display all the same basic physical changes under stress that humans display (elevated cortisol level, elevated heart rate, dilation of the pupils, etc).... yet we still treat these animal horribly and continue to abuse them for our own needs.\n \n So, the unborn. If the fact that it were merely alive was the issue... well, that's just ridiculous. Humans use and abuse the living every second of every day- most of the time, needlessly. It's not the fact that the unborn was or is living. It's that it is comprised of HUMAN genetic material.\n \n Big deal. Living human genetic material is washed down the drain every time I scrub myself a bit too harshly with the loofah brush.\n \n Lots of people want to try and make the unborn into something it is not- a human BEING, with connections to others, with interests, a history, memories, a life. But it has none of these things. It is merely a parasite in the truest sense of the word, feeding off the mother.\n \n And that is the real debate. Does anyone, any court or \"parental unit\" have the right to tell someone, in this case, of course, a woman, that something foreign to them must remain within them? No. As long as the unborn is completely dependent on the mother for its survival it is not a person in the sense that even a newborn infant is (newborn infants are viable and don't require leeching off the mother to survive).\n \n As for surgeries, etc.... Surgeries are not always 100% effective and there is that nasty little four letter word called rape that often renders the virgin pregnant despite her best intentions at celibacy. As for parental permission to terminate... despite the fact that parents aren't perfect and whether or not a minor wants an abortion HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PARENTS (afterall, the unborn isn't their unborn, it is not their potential child and potential liability, it really has nothing to do with them at all except in name).... try telling me that a young girl who is pregnant because her father has raped her is going to even DARE asking for parental permission.....? I doubt it. A back alley operation with a clothes hanger is more likely and there you go: two deaths for the price of one.\n \n Abortion may be a sad thing, depending oupon your views... but to deny the need for it only opens up the possibility for even greater trauma and loss of life.\n \n And for the record, if my parents had chosen to abort me I don't think I would've minded much.

   "And it begs this question: \"How is said mother *positively Mindfully? Imprinting* each human developing/growing inside her\". That's the real question.\n Annie\nI'm curious what sort of thing are you thinking about here, are you suggesting that the fetus might pick up the mother's opinion of it or something else? I don't think that the fetus is going to mystically know the views of the mother toward it, but I'll agree that it might be possibly that it might sense stress in the version of the mother's voice (and I suppose physical stimulus if we were thinking from the point of view of earlier times where this tendancy might have evolved) and may have its initial behaviour altered, possibly leading to quieter but more agressive babies.\n \n Pure speculation, but is certainly something that seems feasible at the very least.\n If we want to be overly dramatic and leap to conclusions (or at least hypotheticals), would the fact that most children who would have otherwise been aborted rather than given up for adoption have felt the actual rejection by the mother influence your opinion at all? I honestly expect there is stats showing that this doesn't occur at all (mainly due to the fact that so much innate communication is visual rather than audial) but if hypothetically if it turned out that 90% of otherwise aborted babies (i.e excluding those that are given up for adoption now) would turn out to be criminals of some sort or another would you reconsider your point of view?",

I'd rather kill myself than let something use me like that for 9 months. YUCK!\n \n And I forget.... you're Americans. So I am trying to be gentle.... but, um, comparing humans to OTHER animals and plants is not off topic or irrelevent.

We have opposable thumbs, which have allowed us to adapt a little better than most primates.

Or only true not worthy point is that we are an incredibly egotistical species that, for the most part, likes to take credit for the inventions of a SELECT few of the homo sapiens spectrum (those that argue- but man has invented this and that... most people are profoundly dense and that is why there are \"HOT COFFEE- CAREFUL NOT TO SPILL\" labels on <cDonald's cups).\n \n Humans ARE animals.\n \n To even suggest anything else is a nice, la-dee-dah fairy tale based in the subconscious' fear of death.\n \n Humans aren't special and the premature termination of one bundle of unthinking cells isn't a tragedy.\n \n What makes a person a person, and not merely a husk to be unplugged from life support?\n \n I'd think most people would agree: memories, opinions, personal desires, goals, dreams, connection to other human animals and non human animals, questions regarding the metaphysical, a desire to learn, to advance...\n \n Fetuses and anything less developed have none of the above. They are tabula rasae, blank disks to be filled, with certain genetic quirks and dispositions. The tragedy of throwing out a few floppies because the office space is getting a little crowded hardly strikes me as a great tragedy.\n \n For the record, I wouldn't view the deaths of most average, non-influential people \"tragic\".

What does an embryo or fetus do BESIDES leech food and nutrients, as well as oxygen, from the mother, without offering anything back in return? The mother in this case is the host, or autosite, the fetus is \"the parasite\". The unborn is also, I think we can both agree, sheltered by the autosite mother.\n \n Now, big words can be tricky and confusing, I realize. But when they say \"different organism\", what they mean is a different life.... not necessarily different species (as the example of conjoined twins, who share 100 percent of their genetics, illustrates). So if someone with your exact DNA can act as a parasite, of course an unborn child acts as a parasite... it uses up food, oxygen and other resources without giving anything back except perhaps morning sickness and hormonal moodswings.... it is not what one would call a \"symbiotic\" relationship because the mother does not require ANYTHING from the unborn to survive, and the unborn requires EVERYTHING. Not exactly fair.\n \n With me still? So, using the above dictionary definition, how exactly is my definition \"uneducated\"? I'd say, if anything, your objection is that I am being a little too educated and pedanatic and probably not emotional enough for the subject. \n \n As for counselling. Yes, I get counselling. My risk of suffering a fatal heart attack due to my almost constant annoyance at the human species puts me in severe risk for my later years (I am 24 now). I have held the same views regarding the unborn and \"motherhood\" since the age of 2, when I had a fairly complete grasp of what an embryo was and why my cousin had that shrivelled bit of umbilical cord drying against her abdomen like a sun-dried annelid.\n \n P.S. Simply calling someone uneducated doesn't make it so. If you don't like their views, find a real hole. Most people seem to use the \"blow BS insults\" in the opponent's face as a means of distracting and unsettling them. However, I know I am educated. I have had two psychiatrists tell me that I knew the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders better than both of them, I grew up in various universities and animal testing labs (and believe me, when a baby monkey is watching it's mother try to sit up after a prefrontal lobotomy... let me tell you! That is true emotion! Not some blip on an ultrasound machine that shows junior the overgrown blastocyst sucking his thumb).\n \n Then again, I write because a few of you will get it. Like William James Sidis said... wait a second. I better not. The chances of anyone around here actually knowing who Sidis is, let alone his work... *nah*",

Whose definition of intelligence are we using? Can animals do \"whatever they want\" without consequence?\n \n Do intelligent organisms know how to spell?\n\n I think that it is hard to deny that nearly all members of our human species (outside of those that are severely mentally challenged) are more intelligent than animals. However, our intelligence is just a jump on a continuous spectrum of intelligence - not a quantum leap into another realm altogether. \n \n Our emotional reactions are not that different from those of many higher animals, except that most of us have forced ourselves through our social expectations and intelligence to suppress the show of those emotions instead of letting them get out of control. Certain social animals can show similar restraints, but much less rigid. As for the more noble emotions: I once read of an interesting experiment in which apes starved themselves for the sake of their fellow apes since, when they would pull a designated rope to get food, their fellow apes would get electric shocks. That means that certain noble emotions that we often associate only with humans can also reside in animals.\n \n Certain animals also have analitic capabilities. Dogs, dolphins, and parrots are just a few examples of species that have shown analytic capabilities. I always enjoy hearing about the research on a parrot named Alex. Parrots ability to immitate human speach has made it easier to investigate their level of intelligence. I have seen videos of Alex being able to tell its owner (with its < 100 word vocabulary) how many, say, red square blocks there were in a pile of randomly shaped blocks of random colors. Here is a web-site on bird intelligence that I found from a quick search on Google:\n \n http://www.pbs.org/lifeofbirds/brain/\n \n We have spent nearly all of our human history automatically assuming that animal intelligence, emotion, etc. were a vast leap below ours. Though I don't think anyone is seriously challenging that we, humans, still have the superior intelligence, new research is showing that certain animals can be a lot more intelligent than we give them credit for. On a last note, the complexity of our civilizations and our levels of knowledge only really took off once we (1) discovered agriculture and animal husbandry and (2) discovered writing. Before that, we had little to show for our more advanced intelligence.",

In the idea of saving more life, (By the way, rape victims don't even have to die) forbidding it for the other 99% of women (couples for Simone) who have nobody to blame but themselves for their pregnancy, the logical choice is obviously clear.\n \n \n \nI'm sorry you have not lessened your opinion on what it means to \"live with a baby for a few months\" nor have you addressed what you're going to do to care for these women and children. I get the distinct impression that you want the kids in the womb for nine months, and then after that it's not your problem. Feel free to show me wrong. \n\n \n I think I can show you I'm wrong with my idea of what to do with these children. By the way, if women want rights to have an abortion because getting pregnant is not their problem or responsibility, I would be considered no less guiltless than they. They seem to think they don't have to, so if I did in this case, logically, I shouldn't be shot either. But I do, so it's different.\n \n I think I've said this about a bizillion times before, a baby can go to an orphange where it can get adopted. NOTHING is stopping those women from giving their baby up for adoption. There are tons of couples who want babies out there to take care of them. It's not like doing that is throwing them into a recycling bin and hope for the best. It is giving them a better chance than their own Mother's give them.\n \n That covered, I've still been looking into after abortion accounts and how many people (including rape victims) would never have an abortion afterwards again. They talk about the psychological and physical scars it left on their bodies and their memories. Something like abortion should not offered as a solution for the reason that they automatically think something like this might heal them. It never does, and months afterwards it can still hurt.\n \n I'm afraid I'm still stuck with the belief that abortion hurts more than it heals. You'll have to do something to try and make me think differently if you want to debate about rape victims.\n \n \nI'm also sorry that you feel 99% of women have abortions irresponsibly. I would think that after your extended conversations here with me and others that while you might disagree with many reasons why women have abortions, at the same time you'd be a little more open-minded as to why they do. \n\n \n I've not seen any reason to change my mind yet.\n \n The actions required to gain a pregnancy are still there. A woman has to voluntarily allow a man access to her body in order for something like this to happen. She does, the baby is conceived, they have to take care of it. For all those people saying a woman wants rights on her body should stop and think first about what she should do to protect it. Like, abstaining from sex. I heard a governor (can't remember the state) made such an information imperative to teaching when to avoid pregnancies.\n \n Those other 99% have nobody to blame but themselves. They didn't think or rights for their body, didn't think of the consequences, so they should keep it. It is their fault, and the baby should not have to die for that.",

From an evolutionary standpoint then, we are simply a member of the animal kingdom whose mental capabilities have so surpassed those of other animals that we have largely mastered that world. \n \n I, for one, am curious about the new research going on in animal intelligence.

After all, I can imagine that, given your religious beliefs, you WANT to believe what he is saying and you do not have the scientific background to realize how wrong he is in most of his \"scientific\" arguements. \n\n \n It would seem the same to the 400+ other sites that say such things. I've still not seen anything to discredit him, though I can't defend him on quite a few things he says as I don't- as you say, retain sufficient knowledge in many scientific areas pertaining to this theory.\n \n But remember this, that other scientists and teachers and professors (Don't ask me how many, I don't know) have been convinced by him and his different debates in colleges. People who have sufficient knowledge of these things agree with him. I'd hardly think that the words from some obviously closed-minded biased site is enough to discredit such a man.\n \n \nI respect your opinion to hold views based on your religious beliefs. However, the thing that is frustrating to me and to many of the other posters is that you are trying to tell us that we are wrong in our views of evolution and man as animal based purely on your opinion and on the views of a popular amateur pseudo-scientist. All in all, your view that man is separate from animals (i.e. not evolved from them) still comes down to it simply being your religious belief - not a scientific one or one based on any credible evidence. \n\n \n Not if you study the posts more closely. People asked me about why I didn't believe in evolution, and I stated my reasons and views. I can't remember telling anyone personally they were wrong, I just said that I didn't.\n \n I think there are scientists out there that would agree with me that man is definitely seperate from animals. I could probably Google it and find a few links.\n \n \nYes, this topic is straying off the main subject of abortion but it did start off as a valid point brought up by angryattheworld. Namely, if it is senscience that matters in the question of rights of the fetus, then why is the senscience of animals not considered important? Namely, we are being inconsistent in our respect for senscience.\n\n \n I am against animal cruelty myself. (But not to the extreme that we don't kill animals for meat of course. I don't think I could live without it.:) )\n \n Even if we are animals (I'm not saying this out of doubt of my own belief) we retain the knowledge to take care of our own species in a moral way, a concept of which I doubt any animals retain the knowledge. That is trying to put the killing of an animal on the same scale as killing a human being. Either Angryattheworld loathes babies because of a bad pregnancy experience or she is really desperate to lower the standards of killing humans. I really do pity her, she has a very dark view on humanity.\n \n \nMy own answer is that I also respect the senscience of animals - enough to advocate against animal cruelty. However, I do have a prejudice for our own species - we are all part of the same \"family\". \n\n \n True. Humans do have the capacity- and automatically the responsibility, to take care of our own.\n \n That family bit actually makes a lot of sense for the Christian view, by the way.:) Just thought I'd point that out.\n \n \nIt may not be a satisfactory answer for some, but almost all people would agree that animals should not have the same rights as people. Among other reasons, they are not capable of having the same responsibilities where rights and responsibilities go somewhat hand in hand. \n\n \n That makes total sense. You are absolutely correct. If animals had the same rights as people, we'd never be able to move anywhere.emoticon_wow We'd have to tear down every factory and industrialized area to keep from intruding on their own respective environmental rights.\n \n We are seperate, and we do rule the animals. And that's another reason I believe we are seperate. We literally rule every animal on this planet, and I don't think just another animal could do that. Something seperate and superior would have to be in that spot. Just a thought I came up with just now, you can debate that if you want.",

People who have sufficient knowledge of these things agree with him. I'd hardly think that the words from some obviously closed-minded biased site is enough to discredit such a man.\n\n I can well imagine that there are many scientists who might agree that there are still aspects of nature which evolution cannot yet explain. Evolution, after all, is still a theory in progress. For example, there will always exist some missing link in the chain of evolution between ape-like creatures and man. After all, it would be impossible to find fossils of every single generation that came between. However, so many intermediate stages have been found between ape and man that that evolutionary path is fairly well outlined. Also, intelligent design proponents often claim irreducible complexity as an arguement against evolution - saying that there are structures in nature that are so complex that the chance of their evolution is negligible. They assume that the constituent parts could not have evolved separately since they only work together. However, all the examples that they have come up with so far have been refuted by other scientists who have indeed found various constituent parts evolving separately. Anyway, my main point is that there may still be unexplained aspects of evolution that may allow room for some people to express skepticism, but this does not discredit evolution. To discredit evolution in favor of another idea, one would have to not only prove that evolution will never have answers to the unexplained aspects, but one would also have to present some credible evidence for the other theory. I'm afraid that your theory of a 10,000 year old earth is sorely lacking in credible evidence.\n \nNot if you study the posts more closely. People asked me about why I didn't believe in evolution, and I stated my reasons and views. I can't remember telling anyone personally they were wrong, I just said that I didn't.\n\n Well, you did say (post #90) \"I am not ashamed of animals and their lack of intelligence, I'm ashamed that some people think we arose from them.\" However, I will accept that you are simply trying to defend your views, as opposed to attacking ours. My only comment here is that you are trying to claim that your views are based on something other than religious belief - a claim that most of us would dispute.\n \nI think there are scientists out there that would agree with me that man is definitely seperate from animals. I could probably Google it and find a few links.\n\n The term \"separate\" is a relative term. Our mental and cultural development has placed us in a far superior position to animals, which make our lives and capabilities distinctly very different from those of animals and, in that way, separate. Similarly, the mental and social development of apes are far above those of fish, making their lives and capabilities very different and, thus, separate. It is all relative. However, any scientist who would refute that humans evolved from ape-like creatures would be faced with the daunting task of explaining away all of the supporting evidence. If they simply choose to ignore that supporting evidence due to dogma, then they do not deserve the name \"scientist\" despite any education they may have had. Science, after all, is the pursuit of truth based on evidence.\n \nEven if we are animals (I'm not saying this out of doubt of my own belief) we retain the knowledge to take care of our own species in a moral way, a concept of which I doubt any animals retain the knowledge. ...\n We are seperate, and we do rule the animals. And that's another reason I believe we are seperate. We literally rule every animal on this planet, and I don't think just another animal could do that. Something seperate and superior would have to be in that spot. Just a thought I came up with just now, you can debate that if you want.\n\n On the first point, many animals do take care of their young and do defend each other. We may not yet have the means to ascertain whether this is purely due to an instinct of compassion or whether there is any thought put into this. However, at least part of our sense of morality is based on our instinctual emotional responses of compassion, self-defense and anger. As to our ruling animals, our mental development and subsequent development of powerful tools has allowed us to control much of the animal kingdom. That does not mean that we did not arise from the animal kingdom. I should also add that often the tiniest animals in the form of viruses, bacteria or insects can get the better of us and, where inanimate nature is concerned, the only reason we feel mastery over nature is that we are lucky enough to live in a fairly benign planet. Hopefully, the effects of global warming will not change that too much.",

But once you have chosen what you know is right and true (if you ever do at all, you still have to deduce what is obviously and inobviously wrong and conclude that whatever is left must be the truth.) then you can count on others in spiritual matters. I do now, and nothing out of the ordinary has happened yet to change that.\n \n By the way, out of the blue occurences that change someone's character does not prove you don't (or didn't) know them. I'm pretty sure you did before your 2 friends went wild. These odd things happen, but that doesn't mean you don't know them. They were probably still just the same person five minutes before the incident. They couldn't have helped that.\n \n \nI trust myself. I live very easily with that. I live very securely in my knowledge that to completely trust people to always do what is good for me, or even good for themselves, is foolish. Ah, perhaps I'm cynical, and that's it. But I've been shown countless times and learned hard lessons about other people. \n\n \n So have I, even in the short time I've lived. But I'm still getting the idea that despite your caution, it goes down to the point where you don't trust anybody. Okay, I know you can't trust a person to ALWAYS do what is good for you, but that's the way people are. It's the way you are as well, and- though you can't trust them that way, you can still know them to the point where you can most of the time.\n \n \n \nNo, I meant that I try to see everything from all sides. Devil's advocate kind of thing. \n\n \n Considering religions, you won't be able to advocate for all the sides. You can skepticize and debate about all these things, but you will have to make a decision, Bell, and you'd better not sit where you are and let your not knowing if black is white skepticism keep you trapped from knowing what it will have to be.",

   "I guess I'm losing here, but I guess I'm not willing to let go on trying to convince you that some things are incorrect and untrue. Having a religion like the Aztecs did when they violently sacrificed their own people (and those of the people they ruled) was obviously wrong. And they fell because of it. Religions like hate have torn their own disciples apart. Religions of alternate realities has turned normal people into strange worshippers of the earth, and the belief that stars and cards and animals and trees hold the prophecies of the future. Those things have been expelled again and again, how can you think that you won't know if these things are true or not without experiencing them? Haven't you seen the proof of their falacies? Stars for instance? \n\n \n You're not \"losing\"-I just haven't been presented with any compelling argument that makes me want to think otherwise. :)\n I don't know anything about the Aztecs. Those people obviously felt strongly about their religion-and who's to say that it wasn't the \"right\" way to worship? Not me! Old Testament, even in Jesus' time, they made animal sacrifices. Who's to say that wasn't the \"right\" way to worship? Not me. I just hope it's not! We scoff at the beliefs of ancient Roman and Greek civilizations-but had we been born in that time, that would have been what we fervently believed in. We are a product of our time & upbringing.\n \n I don't really know much about these people you say believe that stars and cards and animals and trees hold the prophecies of the future. I could dismiss it all, but since I'm ignorant of these matters, I refuse to be so arrogant to make any assumptions about it.\n \n \nWell, until you've made up your mind of where we certainly aren't, I can tell you for a fact that we didn't arise from the loins of the spirits of cards.emoticon_wow\n \n \n I think you mean \"what\" instead of where? At any rate, I doubt we arose from the loins of the spirits of cards, too. But this is distracting from what I did say; which is, that I would love to see some factual evidence of our origins. Anyone got any? No? See my point?\n \n \nBy the way, out of the blue occurences that change someone's character does not prove you don't (or didn't) know them. I'm pretty sure you did before your 2 friends went wild. These odd things happen, but that doesn't mean you don't know them. They were probably still just the same person five minutes before the incident. They couldn't have helped that.\n\n \n Since you do not know the circumstances nor specifics, I will forgive your assumptions here. :) I will reiterate that in fact, in retrospect, I did not know these two people, nor what they were capable of, at all. I hope that you do not have a similar experience.\n \n \n\n So have I, even in the short time I've lived. But I'm still getting the idea that despite your caution, it goes down to the point where you don't trust anybody. Okay, I know you can't trust a person to ALWAYS do what is good for you, but that's the way people are. It's the way you are as well, and- though you can't trust them that way, you can still know them to the point where you can most of the time.\n\n \n To clarify, and I guess I haven't been very concise with language, I do trust people --until they do something that hurts me or someone I care about. However, even though I trust them I always remember that they may do something hurtful towards me or someone I care about-whether it be intentional or not. I am never surprised anymore. \n \n \nConsidering religions, you won't be able to advocate for all the sides. You can skepticize and debate about all these things, but you will have to make a decision, Bell, and you'd better not sit where you are and let your not knowing if black is white skepticism keep you trapped from knowing what it will have to be.\n\n \n Again, my problem with concise language. I wish to be able to advocate from all sides, however that doesn't mean I believe all sides. Pure understanding stems from pure knowledge.\n \n I have made a decision, dear. Just one you don't quite understand. :) I have my beliefs, but I do not discount the beliefs of others.",

I mean come on, how can you advocate for a thing of which you have no knowledge? \n\n \n Again, my lack of concise language has gotten me into trouble. I used the word \"advocate\" originally in the phrase \"devil's advocate\"- meaning that I wish for knowledge of \"each side\" in a debate so that I can fully understand each side. Like with abortion, I try hard to understand where pro-lifers are coming from so that I may understand my \"opponents\"- so to speak. At this point, I feel that I could convincingly argue the pro-life side despite my true feelings on the matter.\n \n Have you ever had an assignment in school where you had to argue the opposite side of what you believed? Did you learn from that experience more about yourself and your views?\n \n Since I led you to miss the boat with the word \"advocate\" I will forgive you for making assumptions regarding my knowledge of things religious and spiritual, as well as assuming that you have some kind of idea what my current state of mind is regarding my spiritual self. :)\n \n \nIf you already claim to not know of these things, I don't think you should even debate it.

You wish that I, who claim to have no knowledge of the origin of wo/mankind, to drop out of discussing it in favor of those who do have this knowledge. Yet no one has the omnipotent knowledge of the origins of human beings, and until we do, there is a vast realm of possibilites out there. My entire point is---do not discount what someone else's beliefs are, because they just might be right, and you have honestly no clue, only your faith.\n \n Hey, you know what, if someone hears a tree speak because they tapped into it's sap line, (cute, by the way) I will highly, highly, highly doubt it. I promise. But then, maybe I'll give it a try, hear it, and then the line starts getting wavy, eh? I used to completely not believe in ghosts whatsoever. Ridiculous, ghosts? C'mon!

   "A braindead person can't be considered actually dead. There have been cases where braindead people have regained the ability to think. Though they are rare occurences, they still happen. And when it comes to morality, I don't see how unplugging a braindead person can be considered moral anyway. They are still living and so have that slight possibility of healing.\n\n Please give some link to those rare cases of someone who is brain dead recovering the ability to think. My only guess is that, if it did happen, the measurement of lack of brain waves over sufficient period of time was not done right. I believe that, currently, there have to be no signs of brain waves for 24 hours for the person to be officially called brain dead. That implies that that part of the brain is, indeed, dead with no chance of recovery. \n \n In the legal definition of brain death, there is no chance of recovery so, therefore, pulling the plug is fine - after all, you are only killing a body then, not a person. However, in other situations, as long as there is a chance of recovery, then I do not think that the plug should be pulled unless the person would have wanted it that way. I fully support people writing living wills to determine when to stop life-support. It would be an excruciating decision to pull life-support from a loved one but their wishes would have to take precedence. The bottom line is that \"life\" is not the only issue to consider. Other important issues are 1) What is it exactly that is alive, and 2) Is the quality of life so horrid that it is better to put the person out of their mysery (best determed ahead of time by the person, or by loved ones - taking into account the chance for recovery).",

The ball is then in the young earth creationists' court but they \"drop the ball\". They do not counter with their own arguements why the Scientists are wrong in their criticism and defense.

Therefore, either 1) I just haven't looked hard enough (perhaps you could find one) or 2) They just don't have any arguement back - i.e. they lost the arguement. Debates are not just a one time back and forth. They are back and forth and back and forth until one side wins.

Science is not a democracy. One does not show equal respect to all views. Those views that carry the preponderance of evidence are the ones that gain respect.

If a simplistic interpretation based on limited knowledge of the evidence and of flawed reasoning should have equal say to a thorough and in-depth analysis of vast quantities of evidence, then our search for truth would have stalled ages ago (as it indeed had stalled during the middle ages when the search for knowledge about our world was constricted by religious dogma). To do science, one must look objectively at evidence, not conveniently ignore evidence that does not coincide with ones point of view. Scientists have looked at the evidence that young earth creationists have presented and easily explained it away.\n\n \n Okay. I have not been here for most of these posts so I apologize for coming in late. Now back to this topic. I have not even visited the sites that your are debunking because I dont need to. Ah were to start? I believe abortion was the main topic... But first I must say some other things. so before we start Abortion is wrong and I will get to that in a bit. \n \n Next I read some arguments on the earths age? Through science we determine the age of the earth through sediment fossil dating correct? Well there are innumerable ways for me to go with this. \n According to the evolutionary theory, life first appeared on this planet in the form of a microscopic, single-celled organism. Hundreds of articles and books have been published containing speculations about how this event may have occured, and crituques of these notions by creation scientists are available. Eventually it is beleived by evolutionists, this first form of life not only diverged into the many single-celled organisms that now exist-bacteria, algae, fungi, amoeba-but that the Metazoa evolved from one or more of these single-celled organisms. Just how that occured and what intermediates were involved is viewed as one of the great, as yet insolved mysteries of evolution. Metazoans, that is, highly complex multi-cellular creatures with specialized organs, abruptly appear fully-formed in the fossil recor that link single-celled organisms to the complex invertebrates that supposedly arose from them.\n The first abundant fossil record of complex invertebrates appears in rocks of the so-called Cambrian Period. it is assumed by evolutionists that the sediments which formed the rocks of the Cambrian began to be deposited about 530 million years ago and that the time involved in their deposition stretched over about five to ten million years. In Cambrian rocks are found fossils of clams, snails, trilobites, sponges, branchiopods, worms, jellyfish, sea urchins, sea cucumbers, swimming crustaceans, sea lilies, and other complex invertebrates. The appearance of this great variety of complex creatures is so startlingly sudden that it is commonly referred to as the \"Cambrian Explosion\" in geological literature.\n \n Sedimentary rocks that are beleived to have formed prior to the Cambrian Period are assigned to a rather nebulous period called the Precambrian. Rocks of the Precambrian generally underlie (although not always) Cambrian rocks and are beleivedto have been laid down during several hundreds of millions of years preceding the Cambrian. There are now many reports in the scientific literature of the discovery in Precambrian rocks of fossils of microscopic, single-celled, soft-bodied creatures, such as bacteria and algae. On the basis of these claims, evolutionists are asserting that life arose on earth more than three billion years ago, perhaps as much as 3.5 billion years ago.\n it would be well to insert a cautionary note at this point concerning the nature of these reports. Certainly many are questionable and open to dispute. Some papers have suggested uncertainties of such identifications. For example, although they accepted the probability that certain alleged microfossils of Precambrian age were of biological origin, Engel et al. cautioned that.\n \n Establishing that the presence of biological activity during the very early Precambrian clearly poses difficult problems... skepticism about this sort of evidence of clearly Precambrian life is appropriate.\n \n In any case, if single-celled creatures gave rise to the vast array of complex invertebrates which abruptly burst open upon the scene, and nearly three billion years intervened between the origin of life and this \"Cambrian Explosion\" of complicated invertebrates, we must find the record of that evolution somewhere in the rocks of the Precambrian. Ever since Darwin the rocks have been intensely searched for this record, but to evolutionists the results have been agonizingly disappointing. Nowhere on this earth--neither on any continent nor on the bottom of any ocean--have we been able to find the intermediates between single-celled organisms and the complex invertebrates. Wherever or whenever we find them, right from the start jellyfish are jellyfish, trilobites are trilobites, and sea urchins are sea urchins.\n \n Concerning this, Axelrod has stated: \n One of the major unsolved problems of geology adn evolution is the occurence of diversified, multicellular marine invertebrates in Lower Cambrian rocks on all the continets and their absence in rocks of greater age.\n \n After discussing the varied types that are found in the Cambrian Axelrod goes on to say:\n However, when we turn to examine the Precambrian rocks for the forerunners of these early Cambrian fossils, they are nowhere to be found. Many thick (over 5,000 feet) sections of sedimentary rock are now known to lie in unbroken succession below strata containing the earliest Cambrian fossils. These sediments apparently were suitable for the preservation of fossils because they are often identical with overlying rocks which are fossiliferous, yet not fossils are found in them.\n \n George Gaylord Simpson has struggled valiantly but not fruitfully with this problem, being forced to concede that the absence of Precambrian fossils (other than those of micro-organisms) is \"the major mystery of the history of life\"\n It had long been maintained by a significant number of evolutionists (including simpson above) that no undoubted multi-cellular fossils had been found in rocks that were unqestionably older than the Cambrian.\n \n Do you see a pattern here? No intermediates anywhere.\n \n In 1984 at Chengjiang in the southern province of Yunnan, China, a spectacular discovery of a vast array of complex invertebrates in Cambrain rocks occured. The strata in which these fossils were found, according to the paleontologists, constitute the very early Cambrian. The discovery was made by Dr. Jan Bergestrom. According to Bergestrom \"the cambrian transition was a revolution more than evolution.\" Refering to what was termed a \"riotous proliferation of more advanced life forms.\" Bergestrom states that \"evolution of these creatures seems to have been a sudden and widespread phenomenon.\" Not only were these the oldest such fossils ever found, according to evolutionists, but their soft body parts were usually well-preserved. Despite their supposed great age, a majority of these fossil species belong to animal groups that still exist. Thus, these creatures were not tiny, primitive fore-runners of later, more advanced forms as evolutionists should expect. It is reported that one creature stood two feet above the floor of the ocean, another had a large disk with concentric air chambers divided into numerous partitions, and the largest animal found was two feet long with stout segmented arms. Three species of trilobites were found. Trilobites, now beleived to be extinct, were just as complex as any invertebrate in existance today.\n As more and more discoveries are made evolutionists are being squeezed more and more.",

I wonder, though, about other situations where someone hasn't made a living will but is clearly suffering with very low chance of recovery. That can be a difficult judgement call - especially if it is a loved one who is suffering and you are making the decision. \n \n \n As for the old earth vs new earth discussion, we can drop that for now (though it looks like I may be continuing some of the discussion with scifmania). I agree that the theory of Evolution is not proven 100%. Indeed, I wouldn't say that any theory is proven 100% (I had a long discussion with Obvious Child about the issues of our source of knowledge in the \"Metaphysical Discussions\" topic in this Abortion forum). However, my general approach and the approach of most scientists is to trust those theories with a lot of evidence more so than those with little or no evidence. Those theories that stand the test of time usually do end up being true (or at least so highly probable that nothing has proven them wrong yet). Evolution has so much evidence behind it that, at this point, most people following science would say that it has a high probability of being true. Does it have all the answers yet?

Ultimatly I was analyzing the data for old earth theories. I had dug up a bunch of them in the net and was weighing the data and looking for any solid evidence (which was lacking).

I have also looked in depth into this young earth theory as well. It holds arguments for a young earth which is easily and only possible through God. There it becomes a question of faith.\n Isn't it ironic that it becomes a question of faith either way you go? Wether you follow pure science and fact which suprisingly enough you must have faith to truly beleive. Just as you must have faith in God the other way?

   "Another opinion", 
   "To your qeuestion Another opinion. Ultimatly I was analyzing the data for old earth theories. I had dug up a bunch of them in the net and was weighing the data and looking for any solid evidence (which was lacking). The fossil data which is not even solid in itself relies on the theory of evolution as well, which has also been equally if not more depressing in its lack of solid evidence. \n So you see, I cannot agree that the earth is millions of years old if all there is, is simple speculation that cannot uphold basic argument. I have also looked in depth into this young earth theory as well. It holds arguments for a young earth which is easily and only possible through God. There it becomes a question of faith.\n Isn't it ironic that it becomes a question of faith either way you go? Wether you follow pure science and fact which suprisingly enough you must have faith to truly beleive. Just as you must have faith in God the other way? That is wherein all these arguments on this forum lay. Ultimatly after reading through everyones thoughts on this fourm. That seems to be the linebreaker. God? Science? God/Science? Which way to go is the question.\n I choose God/Science.\n\n I get the impression that by \"solid evidence\" you mean a complete description with no unknowns and no other possible explanation for the same evidence. It seems that the criteria which you set for proof of Evolution or an old world is impossibly high. \n \n Evidence is not the same thing as absolute proof. Evidence is the appearance of something being true. The more evidence there is for a theory, the stronger the case for that theory until you get to a point where it is extremely likely to be true. There is a lot of evidence for an old world (that first web site that I quoted points out a lot of it) and a lot of evidence for evolution. Are these theories complete? No. But do they have to be? THe evidence for an old earth and for evolution far outweight those of a young earth or creation.\n \n As for your choice of a combination of God and Science (if I am reading that correctly that that is what you mean by God/Science), then that is still a possibility. If you are implying that perhaps God was the one causing the Cambrian explosion or, say, the Big Bang, then, since we have no clear evidence either way, we cannot totally discount that. There is no evidence for it but neither is there evidence against it. That leaves room for people to still hold onto those beliefs while still respecting Science. I admit to having some trends toward a Science / God approach myself - trying to fit some level of religion within the cracks in Science. \n \n My main point is that one cannot just discount large amounts of evidence because it doesn't fit ones dogma. Also, just because a theory isn't complete and doesn't have explanations for everything yet does not mean that it is wrong and a theory that has no evidence therefore has to be right. That makes no logical sense (not that that is what you yourself were claiming).",

   "I'm new here so don't tear me apart too much. \n On the topic of abortion, It seems that the primary issue is what is considered 'alive'. \n \n Disregarding morality and beliefs and looking at the issue from a purely dry, scientific point of view, here is a definition of life taken from \n http://www.religioustolerance.org/abortion.htm: \n \n \"Human life: This is any living entity that has DNA from the species homo sapiens. 9 This includes an ovum, spermatozoon, zygote, embryo, fetus, newborn. It also includes an infant, child, adult, elder. It also includes a breast cancer cell and a hair follicle and a skin scraping. Some forms of human life, like ova and spermatozoa, are generally considered to have little or no value. Others, like a newborn or infant, are generally considered to be extremely valuable; their life is important to preserve.\"\n \n And a definition of a human person taken from the same source. This is where the confict takes place:\n \n \"Human person: Any form of human life that is also considered a person, and thereby is granted civil rights, including the right to life. There is a societal consensus that a newborn is a human person. People disagree about whether a zygote, embryo, or fetus is a human person. People also have different opinions about the stage at which human life becomes a human person. This is one of the core disagreements that causes the conflicts over abortion.\"\n \n After conception, a DNA code is formed that is unique and lasts throughout the person's entire life. At 2 weeks the human zygote is capable of fulfilling all requirements to be considered alive. At 3 weeks the fetus begins to develop limbs. After 4 weeks a heartbeat develops and after 6 weeks brainwaves are detected. According to some scientists, after 2 weeks the fetus is technically 'alive' but is not a person. \n \n In Roe vs. Wade, 1973, the Supreme Court decided that abortion was legal during the first trimester, the first 12 weeks of gestation. At this point, the fetus begins to resemble a person, and is therefore considered a person according to the scientific definition, however, the fetus has been displaying obvious signs of life since two weeks after conception. \n \n With the facts aside, my person opinion is that as a nation, our definition of when a human becomes a person disregards scientific findings. If not immediately after conception, the baby should have human rights within two weeks. At that point, abortion would be murder. No life is worth more than another and aborting a baby for any reason, even if it is done with good intentions, is immoral in my opinion. \n \n I know that is a harsh stand to take and I am aware of all of the difficulties that can be associated with having a child. Childbirth could kill the mother, the child, or both. The child could be born with any number of issues making its' life difficult. The child could be born into poverty or with a mother unequiped to care for it in another way. Regardless of all of this, it is a human life and I am opposed to taking an innocent life for whatever reason. \n \n I belive there are solutions to helping mothers and children who are in bad circumstances but they require more effort on the part of the government.",

   "I don't see where the issue should be when a fetus is \"alive\". A carrot is alive. So is a zygote, but establishing the point of life sheds little light on this topic. The issue is that this is a live \"what\". (I have no idea how dorkus arrived at two weeks.) Discussing when \"life\" begins is fruitless to me.\n \n The issue is personhood. When the embyo/fetus becomes a person is not a scientific question. It is a legal one.\n \n I think the argument above is lucid. We agree that a newborn is a person, there is some point before that we as a society have to decide when personhood starts. That point lies somewhere between zygote and newborn.\n \n My concern is when discussants act like there is an absolute answer. One can give arguments for his point of view, but when there are many smart and ethical people from all over the political spectrum who disagree on this. This tells me that dogmatism is never going to be helpful.",

Alas I have not read it in depth either. Please enlighten me.\n\n \n Well the Hebrew word for day, from what I've learned, doesn't have a specified amount of time. The first day of creation could have taken billions of years because saying \"the first day\" was a way of say \"the first time God created\" and therefore didn't mean 24 hours. With that in mind God could have spent as long as he felt like to create Earth and it would coincide with the Bible. \n \n To add, it could also be possible that when God was creating he was also testing. He could have kept changing his designs on creatures and that would explain fossils that are incredibly old. They are his old designs that he stopped making when he improved upon them which would also look a lot like evolution to modern scientists. I still don't believe humans have been on the earth for millions of year since they were made last. Humans might have only been here for a small thousands of years whereas Earth itself might have been here for longer. I'm still not sure how old Earth is, I'm just looking at different possible theories. I'm not against the young earth or old earth theories.

You follow a Science/God approach while I follow God/Science. This is a first for me lol. You are right. Evidence has always been very important to me. For why would I beleive something unless it rang out true in my ears. Evidence is there to convince and point in the direction of something to be true, but when I look to where it has pointed me and find an papery thin answer that can be easily swayed this way and that to appease whatever i feel like it should, is at the least not worth trusting. \n Where you say \"THe evidence for an old earth and for evolution far outweight those of a young earth or creation.\" I simply disagree, for you see young eath creation has full proof answers if you accept that there is God. \n \n But of course (or at least it seems) you dont accept that, so I can understand where you are comming from. \n \n As for when you say \"My main point is that one cannot just discount large amounts of evidence because it doesn't fit ones dogma.\" I absolutly agree with you. I have spent countless hours studying these theories and evidences. The fact that every time I read through a new theory and found it shallow in answering the ultimate questions, used to be very depressing. But now I have answers. Now I understand why it was so unbleviably hard to find full proof evidnece when i was an evolutionist, There was a key element missing. \n \n (God) \n \n I get the feeling that you feel religion is there to fill in the cracks in Science untill there is a better answer. While I feel that there is no better answer. \n \n Suppose for a moment there is God. God exists and has set moral, good/evil boundaries etc. That is a hypothetical fence. \n Now lets take that fence out of the picture. Remove all religion and God from the world. Madness ensues. Anarchy, complete chaos, and ravagaging of everything. For if there is no future heaven to look to, why be good? Why follow codes of conduct and order when there is no point? So if there isnt God then we should all be attempting to do whatever we feel like. No boudaries. No reason for anything. Might as well go ahead and die if this is the case. We should die and dissapear out of existance. The possibilities for evolution are somewhere in the trillions to the power of 60, so life will never exist again. And so life dissapears in our empty void of a universe and thats it. The end. All that is left after us will be rocks in space drifting around. \n So the point remains, without God I may as well run down the street killing as many people as possible untill I die. For, why not? There is no reason not to.\n \n This world is not of random chaos (aside from the law of thermodynamics). Sitting in the woods one day it was obvious the incredible intricacy and order everything held about it.\n Even to the smallest thing such as DNA. It holds order that could not have occured through random chance. The mathematical impossibilities and improbabilities are phenomenal. \n For example:\n There is a tree called the Brazillian nut tree. It drops a rather large nut that does not break when it hits the ground. by the time it decays the seeds inside of it are dead and useless. However, the tree still exists. It survives because a rat with razor sharp teeth specifically designed for this tree, digs into it and eats the nuts then excriments them. The seeds then are not only free from the powerfull container but are also fertilized. For a tree to evolve and a rat to evolve at the same time for those exact reasons are spectacularly impossible. \n Is my criteria for evolution exceedingly high? Or perhaps the things evolution tries to answer are impossible. All of these scientific theories in essece tell me that none of this world can exist.\n \n With God Everything works.",

   "In response to Scifmania, Symbiote states:\n \n \"So you're a sociopathic killer who keeps his murderous impulses in check only through fear of god? Are all christians similarly inclined?\"\n \n \n I am new to these forums but it seems to me that Scifmania's response went right over Symbiote's head. Scifmania's point is that if there is no God, there is no reason for anything. Let's eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow, or in a few years, we die. One should spend one's life pursuing pleasure or whatever one wants, with no concern or regard for others except to the extent they can further one's own pleasure/happiness. We die, we turn to dust, and that is all there is. \n \n Those who believe in a God, whether the Christian, Hebrew, Islamic or some other religion's God, generally reject that view as it reduces us to mere animals, actually less than animals, for animals do not hurt others for enjoyment, or kill out of jealousy, etc.\n \n Some of the foremost evolutionists alive today have written that if evolution is right, then there is no God, indeed can be no room for a God, that we are ourselves God, and responsible to no one but ourselves.\n \n Hitler believed that, as did Stalin. Have you ever read Hitler's book, Mein Kampf? In there he talks extensively about Darwin and the theory of evolution and survival of the fittest. What Darwin's theory did, for people like Hitler and Stalin and others who have come after them, was to eliminate God from the universe and when God was eliminated and they became, in effect, their own Gods, they then went out and practiced what the theory of evolution preaches, survival of the fittest. Hitler excecuted/exterminated Jews, homosexuals. the old and infirm, the mentally retarded, gypsies, in short, anyone who did not fit his definition of \"the fittest\". He believed that all Caucasians, except Aryans, were sub-human and worthy of death. He felt the same about people with yellow, brown, red, and black skin--all were sub-human to him and so it was okay in his mind, and the millions who followed him, to try to exterminate them.\n \n In the world that we would have today, had those two monsters, either of them, succeeded in imposing their \"evolutionary survival of the fittest\" world upon humanity, the kindness, the nurturing, the caring, that we have for each other, the way we take care of the elderly and the sick, the way we try to save animals and plants from extinction, all of that would be gone and we would live in a brutal world where whoever is in charge sets all the rules and if you do not like those rules, accept them or be eliminated. \n \n Stalin killed 40 million of his own people. Hitler had 6 million of the \"not fittest\" by his definition gased and cremated, men, women and little children. World War II led to the deaths of some 60 million people. Since then, there have been others that have slaughtered people--Mao Tse Tung, Pol Pot of Cambodia, etc. \n \n It is religion that gives people hope that there is something better than the suffering and evil, along with good, that we experience on this planet.

   "Here's a harder one - prove yours to be correct. Not for me; but for yourself. And I'm not gonna start a new thread; you're welcome to PM me if you like. I'm all ears.\n\n \n Look at the nations. Look at the way Christianity has affected so many people world wide. It has changed entire empires, turned savage fearful tribes into God-fearing peaceful people. It has changed the hearts of so many people, and has an effect more powerful than any other religion on earth. \n \n It even managed to get to me, and open my eyes as to how wrong I was going in my way of life, and last winter I managed to get back on track and I was recently baptized. It has changed my life, and I could not do any of things I have without personal help from another person. His name is Jesus, and he's given me the courage to accept the things I can't change, the courage to change the things I could and the wisdom to know the difference. I could never do that on my own, but with God's help, I have. I am not praying to a non-existant being here, he has helped me personally and has spoken to me through his word and my prayers. He is real, no doubt about that. \n \n It wasn't until I began to hate my sin and look to him for help did I realize his power. I have felt his presence, and others have been blessed because of it. Not because of what I did, but because they saw God working in me. I am a changed person, something I never accomplished when I tried on my own. A non-existant being could never do that. By my knowledge of God's truth and his existance and his sacrifice, I know my beliefs to be correct.\n \n Initial teachings that are glorified by the religions of Budda and Confucious may be good in some ways, but none of them will take proper root if there isn't an absolute authority- namely God, enforcing them. If he didn't exist, or his word wasn't true, than how did I change? How has it motivated missionaries to go to places where the chances for being killed were practically 100%? What motivated them to live for years to reach those people while completely changing their lifestyle and sacrificing comforts they had had for their entire lives? How did those whole nations of savage brutal people change? God was there, and he helped them. I can certainly certify my view to be correct.",

   "Suppose for a moment there is God. God exists and has set moral, good/evil boundaries etc. That is a hypothetical fence. \n Now lets take that fence out of the picture. Remove all religion and God from the world. Madness ensues. Anarchy, complete chaos, and ravagaging of everything. For if there is no future heaven to look to, why be good? Why follow codes of conduct and order when there is no point? So if there isnt God then we should all be attempting to do whatever we feel like. No boudaries. No reason for anything. Might as well go ahead and die if this is the case. We should die and dissapear out of existance. The possibilities for evolution are somewhere in the trillions to the power of 60, so life will never exist again. And so life dissapears in our empty void of a universe and thats it. The end. All that is left after us will be rocks in space drifting around. \n So the point remains, without God I may as well run down the street killing as many people as possible untill I die. For, why not? There is no reason not to.\n\n I don't see how you can assume this. First of all, most of the most brutal wars in history have been led by religious people who felt they had God on their side. The current crisis of terrorism in the world is largely caused by a religion that tells young men that they will automatically go to a wondrous heaven if they die for their faith. Even given various circumstances that may have otherwise led them to hate the West, do you really think that they would blow themselves up along with so many innocents if it were not for their religious beliefs? History has shown that religion does not stop violence or the horrors of this world and, in many cases, is used as an excuse for them. Human nature will be human nature and will use the arguements of the society that it finds itself in (be it religious or secular) to justify its actions. The thing we do have which stops us from violent actions is a sense of compassion that seems to be part of our biological makeup itself. It is our societies that can either nurture that compassion or subdue it in the name of an external goal. Nothing in history has shown me that those countries ruled on religious grounds are any less violent than those that are ruled on secular grounds. As for personal morality, it is absurd to think that people who are not religious have no restraints on their morality. People have the capacity for compassion and empathy that is independent of any social construct (religious or secular). I, for one, do not stop myself from hurting others due to fear or respect for God. I do it because I feel compassion for others and would feel guilty if I purposely hurt someone if that hurt could be avoided. \n \nThis world is not of random chaos (aside from the law of thermodynamics). Sitting in the woods one day it was obvious the incredible intricacy and order everything held about it.\n Even to the smallest thing such as DNA. It holds order that could not have occured through random chance. The mathematical impossibilities and improbabilities are phenomenal. \n\n The calculations of improbability I have heard from people who argue against Evolution are based on false assumptions - namely, that the thing that turned out was the ultimate goal. For example, the chance that another set of beings exactly like us turning out in another planet is miniscule. However, that does not mean that some other type of intelligent life might not arise. As for arguements such as irreducible complexity, I would refer you to the Intelligent Design vs. Evolution section of 4forums.com, where people far more knowledgable on the details of Evolution than I present very valid arguements. Basically, for most if not all of the challenges (such as irreducible complexity) that anti-Evolutionists have brought up, scientists have found examples which negate their arguements.\n \n Evolution and Science in general does not have all the answers. However, that does not automatically mean that the only alternative is God. Before we knew what causes lightning, we thought it was caused by the gods / God - until we learned otherwise. Does this mean that Science will eventually push out all room for a belief in God or the supernatural? I doubt it and, personally, I hope it doesn't. For example, I would still like to believe that there is more to us than just the physical - I have no evidence for this but it is still not completely disproven. So, I try to fit some level of religion within those unknowns of Science.",

There are a few arguments that I could bring up to try and salvage what I said, but they would not represent how I feel now. \n\n I have always found it tragic how so many religions, whose original intent may have been far more peaceful and compassionate, can be destorted by people with an agenda into excuses for war and brutality. People often will pick and choose the teachings of a particular religion to suite their purpose. Even Islam, which is blamed for so much violence, when taken as a whole, is far more mild than the distorted version. In an ideal world, I would agree with you that religion can be a force for good (though I would argue that it is not the only force for good). Unfortunately, the real world is often different.\n \n One would think that those countries and peoples that are more prosperous and, therefore, mainly more educated and less desparate would be more compassionate in their approach to others - both in their religious outlook and in their secular outlook. In general, I think that tends to be true. On those occasions when our (US) government ever performs any brutal actions against others, most of the time it is without the knowledge of the people (either due to lack of proper reporting or simple disinterest in foreign affairs). The thing that scares me is that otherwise peaceful and compassionate people can be turned barbarous and cruel under the right circumstances. Even the September 11 terrorist attacks caused many people to not only blame those responsible but to hate all of Islam. Imagine how harshly people would react if the crisis was much larger.\n \n That is why I am so supportive of a free press and of a society which has the courage to teach all sides of an issue instead of spreading propaganda that makes an enemy subhuman.

I'd really have to work at being compassionate. \n\n I also have to admit that, if a loved one were killed in a criminal act or in a war, it would be very difficult for me to view the perpetrators with any compassion as a fellow human being. Fortunately, I am lucky enough to live in a country (the US) which has never dealt with the inhumanity of an invading force. That is one of the reasons why so many Americans retain a sense of idealism that other countries (I have Europeans in mind) find quaint but useful - at least in past years. How would we change, on the national and personal level, if we were subject to the same brutalities that many other people have experienced? I fear that we would distort the secular and religious ideals of freedom and righteousness to wage brutal war on not only the guilty but on the innocent as well. When people act on hate, their judgement is often very impaired.\n \nJust as an abortion wouldn't \"cure\" pain from a rape an act of murder by the gov't on my loved one's behalf wouldn't \"cure\" anything.

Surely I am not the only person out here like this. Why does this phenomenon exist?\n\n Well, if a woman was raped and got pregnant from that rape, it would take a very strong personality indeed to be able to keep that pregnancy from being a mental torture - a constant reminder of that rape, that extremely personal violation. Not too many people are strong enough to withstand that. \n \n I think that part of your view of the pro-choice stance being contrary to the semi-vegetarian stance or stances against the death penalty stems from your assumptions about the embryo/fetus. My personal view, being closer to pro-choice, is that what matters most is when the fetus starts acquiring a mind. That is when I start to feel compassion (it is hard to feel compassion to just a body) and would place strong restrictions on abortion. Science seems to tell us that the first possibility of that is around the beginning of the third trimester. Most people who I know who are pro-choice are also quite uncomfortable with third trimester abortions since the fetus indeed starts to become quite similar to a baby. However, the great majority of abortions happen in the first trimester (almost 90%), when the embryo/fetus is in a state so far from a born baby that it elicits much less compassion. Then, the compassion for the woman wins out for most pro-choice people. \n \nOh sweetest Utopia, where art thou?\n\n I know that it is wishful thinking to hope that our press would be completely free and objective. However, I think that one should never loose one's sense of idealism completely. Idealism is not the same as naivete. Just because one thinks that an ideal is possible doesn't mean that one thinks it currently exists or that it would be easy. I just think that, once we lose hope and become cynical, the battle becomes lost and an ideal that once had a chance then has no chance.",
