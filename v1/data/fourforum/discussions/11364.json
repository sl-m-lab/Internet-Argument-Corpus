   "Dr Collins disagrees with you moose. It seems that although heritability is a factor in human traits, it doesn't mean it's inevitable at all. Choice still plays a part in what human beings become according to the Genome Project results.\n \n \"Homosexuality Is Not Hardwired,\" Concludes Dr. Francis S. Collins, Head Of The Human Genome Project\n  A. Dean Byrd, Ph.D, MBA, MPH\n \n April 4, 2007 - Dr. Francis S. Collins, one of the world's leading scientists who works at the cutting edge of DNA, concluded that \"there is an inescapable component of heritability to many human behavioral traits. For virtually none of them is heredity ever close to predictive.\"\n \n \n Dr. Francis S. Collins\n In reviewing the heritability (influence of genetic factors) of personality traits, Dr. Collins referenced the estimates of the percentage of various human personality traits that can be ascribed to heredity from the Bochard and McGue research.\n \n The heritability estimates for personality traits were varied: General Cognitive Ability (50%), Extroversion (54%), Agreeableness (42%), Conscientiousness (49%), Neuroticism (48%), Openness (57%), Aggression (38%) and Traditionalism (54%).\n \n Kirk et al. (2000) in their research using a community-based cohort of Australian twins reported a heritability estimate of 30% for homosexuality. Whitehead (1999, 2006) in his extensive review of the research cites 30% as the estimate of heritability for homosexuality as well, though he views the estimate as a maximum.\n \n Estimates of heritability are based upon careful analyses of studies conducted with identical twins. Such studies are important and lead to the conclusion that heredity is important in many of these traits. It is important however, to note that even in such studies with identical twins, that heritability is not to be confused as inevitability.\n \n As Dr. Collins would agree, environment can influence gene expression, and free will determines the response to whatever predispositions might be present.Dr. Collins succinctly reviewed the research on homosexuality and offers the following: \"An area of particularly strong public interest is the genetic basis of homosexuality. Evidence from twin studies does in fact support the conclusion that heritable factors play a role in male homosexuality. However, the likelihood that the identical twin of a homosexual male will also be gay is about 20% (compared with 2-4 percent of males in the general population), indicating that sexual orientation is genetically influenced but not hardwired by DNA, and that whatever genes are involved represent predispositions, not predeterminations.\"\n \n Dr. Collins noted that environment, particularly childhood experiences as well as the role of free will choices affect all of us in profound ways. As researchers discover increasing levels of molecular detail about inherited factors that underlie our personalities, it's critical that such data be used to illuminate, not provide support to idealogues.\n \n Citing such dangers, Dr. Collins referred to the book written by activist Dean Hamer who declared the discovery of the God Gene (this same author also is associated with \"discovering the gay gene\").\n \n Dr. Collins noted that the \"evidence\" in Hamer's book \"grabbed headlines,\" but was \"wildly overstated.\"\n http://www.narth.com/docs/nothardwired.html",

   "NARTH as a source? Are you kididng? Let's talk about flying dragons! Do a google search on that doctors name. Would you trust his opinion on genetics or science? I sure wouldn't!\n\n \n Here's Collins bio, I don't see a problem with him. Nothing about it implies he is anti-gay or has an axe to grind with homosexuality at all. And his accomplishments regarding genetics and science seem impeccable.\n Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D., a physician-geneticist noted for his landmark discoveries of disease genes, and his visionary leadership of the Human Genome Project (HGP), is director of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI).\n \n As head of NHGRI, Collins oversaw the HGP, the multidisciplinary, multi-institutional, international effort to map and sequence the 3 billion letters in the human DNA instruction book. Many consider this project to have been the most significant scientific undertaking of our time. The ultimate goal is to improve human health.\n \n With Collins at the helm, the HGP attained historic milestones, while consistently running ahead of schedule and under budget. A working draft of the human genome sequence was announced in June 2000, and an initial analysis was published in February 2001. HGP scientists finished the sequence in April 2003, coinciding with the 50th anniversary of Watson and Crick's seminal publication describing the double helix structure of DNA.\n \n But the exploration of the genome is really just beginning. Building upon the foundation laid by the HGP, researchers around the globe are now collaborating on a wide range of projects that are using genomic tools and technologies to expand understanding of human biology and combat human disease.\n \n NHGRI-supported initiatives currently include efforts to map human genetic variation, to develop less costly sequencing technologies and to unravel the genetics of cancer and other common diseases. Following the precedent set by the HGP under Collins' leadership, these projects are committed to making their data rapidly and freely available to the worldwide scientific community.\n \n Beginnings\n \n Raised on a small farm in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, Collins was home-schooled until the sixth grade. Throughout most of his high school and college years, the aspiring chemist had little interest in what he then considered the \"messy\" field of biology. He earned a B.S. in chemistry at the University of Virginia in 1970 and a Ph.D. in physical chemistry at Yale University in 1974. While at Yale, however, a course in biochemistry sparked his interest in the molecules that hold the blueprint for life: DNA and RNA. Collins recognized that a revolution was on the horizon in molecular biology and genetics. He changed fields and enrolled in medical school at the University of North Carolina, where he earned an M.D. in 1977.\n \n From 1978 to 1981, Collins served a residency and chief residency in internal medicine at North Carolina Memorial Hospital in Chapel Hill. He then returned to Yale, where he was named a Fellow in Human Genetics at the medical school from 1981 to 1984. During that time, he developed innovative methods of crossing large stretches of DNA to identify disease genes.\n \n After joining the University of Michigan in 1984 in a position that would eventually lead to a Professorship of Internal Medicine and Human Genetics, Collins heightened his reputation as a relentless gene hunter. That gene-hunting approach, which he named \"positional cloning,\" has developed into a powerful component of modern molecular genetics.\n \n In contrast to previous methods for finding genes, positional cloning enabled scientists to identify disease genes without knowing in advance what the functional abnormality underlying the disease might be. Collins' team, together with collaborators, applied the new approach in 1989 in their successful quest for the long-sought gene responsible for cystic fibrosis. Other major discoveries soon followed, including isolation of the genes for Huntington's disease, neurofibromatosis, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, and the M4 type of adult acute leukemia.\n \n Leadership at NHGRI\n \n Tapped to take on the leadership of the HGP, Collins accepted an invitation in 1993 to become director of the National Center for Human Genome Research, which became NHGRI in 1997. As director, he oversees the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium and many other aspects of what he has called \"an adventure that beats going to the moon or splitting the atom.\"\n \n In 1994, Collins founded NHGRI's Division of Intramural Research (DIR), an intramural program of genome research that has developed into one of the nation's premier research centers in human genetics.\n \n Collins is particularly excited by the rapid progress being made in uncovering genetic risk factors for common diseases, such as heart disease, cancer and mental illness. The windfall of findings has been made possible by a relatively new research approach, called genome-wide association studies. This approach utilizes tools created by the HGP and the NHGRI-led International HapMap Project, which constructed a map of common human genetic variation.\n \n Collins's work in his highly active lab demonstrates his commitment to research involving both rare and common diseases. In April 2003, a team led by Collins identified the genetic basis of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, a rare disorder that causes a dramatic form of premature aging. Besides opening the door to possible treatment strategies for progeria, the discovery may provide insights into the process of normal human aging.\n \n As for common disorders, Collins and his colleagues published a landmark study in the journal Science on genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes. The findings boosted to at least 10 the number of genetic variants associated with increased susceptibility to the adult-onset form of diabetes, which affects nearly 21 million people in the United States and more than 200 million worldwide.\n \n In addition to his long list of contributions to basic genetic research and scientific leadership, Collins is known for his close attention to ethical and legal issues in genetics. He has been a strong advocate for protecting the privacy of genetic information and has served as a national leader in efforts to prohibit gene-based insurance discrimination. Building on his own experiences as a physician volunteer in a rural missionary hospital in Nigeria, Collins is also very interested in opening avenues for genome research to benefit the health of people living in developing nations.\n \n Collins' accomplishments have been recognized by numerous awards and honors, including election to the Institute of Medicine and the National Academy of Sciences.\n \n On Nov. 5, 2007, Collins received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civil award, for his revolutionary contributions to genetic research.\n http://www.genome.gov/10001018",

Consider it rhetorical.\n\n \n How absolutely incredible that you refer to Mendel in order to make a point about genetics. You really should research your scientific heros before referring to them. This one was a christian. And to answer your question, since he discovered the gene, he did understand the concepts that genetics is based upon and he was able to define its application regarding the pea plant.\n Gregor Mendel was one of the first people to practice the science of genetics. Yet he wasn't a scientist. He was an obscure monk living in poverty. His work was tedious and demanding. Although he published several papers describing his research, few people read them. He was ahead of his time, and his fame would not arrive until long after his death. Although he did not live long enough to see his work recognized, his experiments put him on the same level with the most celebrated scientists of all time. \n Mendel picked common garden pea plants for the focus of his research because they can be grown easily in large numbers and their reproduction can be manipulated. Pea plants have both male and female reproductive organs. As a result, they can either self-pollinate themselves or cross-pollinate with another plant. In his experiments, Mendel was able to selectively cross-pollinate purebred plants with particular traits and observe the outcome over many generations. This was the basis for his conclusions about the nature of genetic inheritance. \n \n According to the principle of independent assortment, different pairs of alleles are passed to offspring independently of each other. The result is that new combinations of genes present in neither parent are possible. For example, a pea plant's inheritance of the ability to produce purple flowers instead of white ones does not make it more likely that it will also inherit the ability to produce yellow pea seeds in contrast to green ones. Likewise, the principle of independent assortment explains why the human inheritance of a particular eye color does not increase or decrease the likelihood of having 6 fingers on each hand. Today, we know this is due to the fact that the genes for independently assorted traits are located on different chromosomes .\n \n These two principles of inheritance, along with the understanding of unit inheritance and dominance, were the beginnings of our modern science of genetics. However, Mendel did not realize that there are exceptions to these rules. \n It should be noted though that Mendel made no claims or conclusions regarding inheritable traits such as homosexuality, in human beings so I don't know what this has to do with this debate other than to attempt to insult me.\n \n http://anthro.palomar.edu/mendel/mendel_1.htm",

   "Dr Collins disagrees with you moose. It seems that although heritability is a factor in human traits, it doesn't mean it's inevitable at all. Choice still plays a part in what human beings become according to the Genome Project results.\n \n \"Homosexuality Is Not Hardwired,\" Concludes Dr. Francis S. Collins, Head Of The Human Genome Project\n  A. Dean Byrd, Ph.D, MBA, MPH\n \n April 4, 2007 - Dr. Francis S. Collins, one of the world's leading scientists who works at the cutting edge of DNA, concluded that \"there is an inescapable component of heritability to many human behavioral traits. For virtually none of them is heredity ever close to predictive.\"\n \n \n Dr. Francis S. Collins\n In reviewing the heritability (influence of genetic factors) of personality traits, Dr. Collins referenced the estimates of the percentage of various human personality traits that can be ascribed to heredity from the Bochard and McGue research.\n \n The heritability estimates for personality traits were varied: General Cognitive Ability (50%), Extroversion (54%), Agreeableness (42%), Conscientiousness (49%), Neuroticism (48%), Openness (57%), Aggression (38%) and Traditionalism (54%).\n \n Kirk et al. (2000) in their research using a community-based cohort of Australian twins reported a heritability estimate of 30% for homosexuality. Whitehead (1999, 2006) in his extensive review of the research cites 30% as the estimate of heritability for homosexuality as well, though he views the estimate as a maximum.\n \n Estimates of heritability are based upon careful analyses of studies conducted with identical twins. Such studies are important and lead to the conclusion that heredity is important in many of these traits. It is important however, to note that even in such studies with identical twins, that heritability is not to be confused as inevitability.\n \n As Dr. Collins would agree, environment can influence gene expression, and free will determines the response to whatever predispositions might be present.Dr. Collins succinctly reviewed the research on homosexuality and offers the following: \"An area of particularly strong public interest is the genetic basis of homosexuality. Evidence from twin studies does in fact support the conclusion that heritable factors play a role in male homosexuality. However, the likelihood that the identical twin of a homosexual male will also be gay is about 20% (compared with 2-4 percent of males in the general population), indicating that sexual orientation is genetically influenced but not hardwired by DNA, and that whatever genes are involved represent predispositions, not predeterminations.\"\n \n Dr. Collins noted that environment, particularly childhood experiences as well as the role of free will choices affect all of us in profound ways. As researchers discover increasing levels of molecular detail about inherited factors that underlie our personalities, it's critical that such data be used to illuminate, not provide support to idealogues.\n \n Citing such dangers, Dr. Collins referred to the book written by activist Dean Hamer who declared the discovery of the God Gene (this same author also is associated with \"discovering the gay gene\").\n \n Dr. Collins noted that the \"evidence\" in Hamer's book \"grabbed headlines,\" but was \"wildly overstated.\"\n http://www.narth.com/docs/nothardwired.html\n\n \n If homosexuality is not hardwired, then neither is heterosexuality.

   "It is untrue to say that evidence suggesting a genetic basis of homosexuality is \"inconclusive at best\".\n \n There has no allele that has be discovered that clearly \"causes\" homosexuality, that is true. But neither has there been for many other conditions that are readily accepted as having a genetic basis. Family cohort studies clearly show that homosexuality is inheritable. I would go so far as to say that this is \"common knowledge.\"\n \n Therefore, I will not provide links. This has been done repeatedly on this forum and they apparently have been ignored. Mostly there is no evidence that could be provided that would change the minds of some.\n \n\n Such as? I have never ignored any links to any studies that claim they've found evidence that people are born gay. Every one that I've disagreed with I've explained clearly why I felt either the method or conclusion was lacking. And exactly what hereditary traits are you talking about where the associated allele has not been discovered? \n \n \nWhat I don't understand is why this is so hard to accept. Nor do I understand the implication that there is some cabal of researchers who desperately want gayness to be genetic and are publishing disreputable studies to confirm their perconceived notions. I don't know why this would be. Moreover why would this poor research survive peer review when others do not? How is it you seem to think that this single topic does not provide reliable information?\n \n\n Its not only this topic. I'm actually very sceptical about the study of behavioral science as a whole. As far as I know, the only behaviors proven to be controlled by genes are those caused by mental disorders. Homosexuality is not a mental disorder, but it is one of the few behavioral traits conveniently lumped together with them in order to justify the quest for the gay gene. And yet most gays don't seem to have a problem with this. \n \n \nUnker, you seem like a very nice person. I say this because I do not want to appear to lump you in the same category as youknowwho. In my opinion, you make reasoned arguments, ask interesting questions and seem to truly want to learn. But if I may, you seem to be struggling with something that won't let you accept these ideas. \n \n At this point in time, there really is little question that homosexuality has a genetic aspect. Do we know \"the\" gene? Of course not. First, this likely is not as simple as that and involves much more complex genetic processes. We don't know the clear genetic basis of may human attributes that are definitely known to be genetic. Personality, behavior and complex attributes like that involve multiple process that work in concert.\n \n I mostly don't understand why this topic gets repeatedly debated when it has been asked and answered before.\n\n Have you thought about the ramifications of the discovery that homosexuality has no genetic influence? It would cause the religious sector to jump in glee pointing judgemental fingers at the gay community. It would undermine the argument that homosexuality is not a sin.\n \n The underlying issue isn't whether people are born gay or not, but rather if people should be judged negatively for their sexual orientation. Bible-believers think they should be judged, because they blindly follow whatever is written in the bible without questioning. Gays, for some reason, are hugely swayed by the opinion of these bible-followers to the point where they are willing to spend millions of dollars to seek the approval of this bible-believing community. Thus we have these surveys, theories and statistics coming out of the woodworks. And with anything being repeated enough times, people start to think its true. \n \n When you think about it, the solution fits the problem perfectly. You start of with gullible people that don't think for themselves who believe that something is true based on the fact that most people also believe the same thing. So the obvious solution would be to convince these gullible people of something by repeating it enough times so that it becomes generally accepted as true. Pure genius, but unfortunately based on lies. \n \n I could sit here and explain that the bible is pure bulls**t and we have absolutely no obligation to be sucked in to what a bunch of bible-thumping loonies think. And you'd probably sit there and realise that its true, that we really don't have to give a f*** about what the bible says, or what those intolerant XXXXXX think. But chances are that you won't, because it would mean stepping away from the herd, it would mean not going with the \"generally accepted\" beliefs and axioms. And nobody likes to go against the grain. We've been fighting so hard and so long for acceptance that going out on a limb would undermine all the effort we've already expended. At this point, what is important isn't truth, its security. \n \n You'd probably read my posts criticizing the \"evidence\" for the gay gene and think to yourself Paul is full of s**t and is just like the rest of the gay bashers out there who want to blame us for our lifestyle and point condemning fingers at us. That is totally as far from true as possible. I criticize the studies and their conclusion because I happen to value truth above security. And I'm more than willing to be ridiculed for that.",

   "Like I said, inconclusive at best. I think scientists are trying to prove that homosexuality is predetermined rather than a matter of choice, but I wouldn't call that science.\n\n \n I'd call it leading where the evidence points. When scientists say that sexual orientation is in large part biologically determined, they usually mean a combination of genes and biological environment. This doesn't definitively exclude social or learning influences, but so far, there is no good evidence to suppose those are major factor, while there is plenty of good evidence to suppose a strong biological determinant, whether it is foetal genes or maternal uterine environment.\n \n \nYou, and many, many others, take the results of these studies as evidence that homosexuality may be predetermined, and this is an easily acceptable position because it supports what you already believe about homosexuality. I'm not as eager to jump on that bandwagon because in my view, and from my understanding of science, if something \"may be evidence\" of a correlation between 2 things, then its not evidence, and should be treated as such. Nothing else I know of in science is founded on what \"may be a correlation\".\n \n \n EVERYTHING in science is founded on correlation -- it's the first evidence that there is a connection between observations. Of course, then one looks for causes.\n \n I tell youl extensive research has failed to provide ANY support for theories of social determination of sexual orientation. Not one has panned out.

   "Such as? I have never ignored any links to any studies that claim they've found evidence that people are born gay. Every one that I've disagreed with I've explained clearly why I felt either the method or conclusion was lacking. \n\n \n There are twin and family cohort studies that suggest homosexuality is hereditary. If you have an issue with the methodology, I would be interested. No study has proven anything conclusively. Proof of causation of anything is rare.\n \n \n \nAnd exactly what hereditary traits are you talking about where the associated allele has not been discovered? \n\n The ability to curl your tongue, atherosclerosis, blue eyes, high IQ, prostate cancer, .... most everything we think has a genetic component. \n \n \n \nIts not only this topic. I'm actually very sceptical about the study of behavioral science as a whole. As far as I know, the only behaviors proven to be controlled by genes are those caused by mental disorders. Homosexuality is not a mental disorder, but it is one of the few behavioral traits conveniently lumped together with them in order to justify the quest for the gay gene. And yet most gays don't seem to have a problem with this. \n\n \n I don't know what to say if you are skeptical about all of behavioral science. Granted some of it is \"soft\", but that is because much of the data is qualitative. It's the best you can do. Anyway, I don't know of any mental disorders that have been \"proven\" to be controlled by genes to any greater degree than homosexuality or any of those other items I named above. I also do not know what this \"quest for the gay gene\" is of which you speak.\n \n \nHave you thought about the ramifications of the discovery that homosexuality has no genetic influence? It would cause the religious sector to jump in glee pointing judgemental fingers at the gay community. It would undermine the argument that homosexuality is not a sin.\n\n \n I don't care whether it's genetic or not.(I actually don't care if it's a choice or not, though I don't think it is.) Nor do I care how gleeful the religious sector would be. The anti-gay religious folks are pretty successful at being judgemental now, even with pretty clear evidence that being gay is not a choice. They have never been a group to care what science says if it contradicts them. \n \n \nThe underlying issue isn't whether people are born gay or not, but rather if people should be judged negatively for their sexual orientation. Bible-believers think they should be judged, because they blindly follow whatever is written in the bible without questioning. Gays, for some reason, are hugely swayed by the opinion of these bible-followers to the point where they are willing to spend millions of dollars to seek the approval of this bible-believing community. Thus we have these surveys, theories and statistics coming out of the woodworks. And with anything being repeated enough times, people start to think its true. \n\n \n I disagree with this. I don't know who these people are that are \"hugely swayed\" and seek religion's approval. I don't know any. Maybe some religious gays do, but they believe all sorts of silly things. Who is spending millions of dollars? Are you saying the research in this topic is gay funded? Most research in this country is federally funded and believe me, the money ain't gushing and most grant reviewers are pretty conservative, and have no connection to any pro-gay organizations. Sounds like conspiracy paranoia.\n \n \n \nWhen you think about it, the solution fits the problem perfectly. You start of with gullible people that don't think for themselves who believe that something is true based on the fact that most people also believe the same thing. So the obvious solution would be to convince these gullible people of something by repeating it enough times so that it becomes generally accepted as true. Pure genius, but unfortunately based on lies. \n\n \n You lost me here. You have described religion and Republican campaign strategy, not research on the genetic nature of homosexuality. \n \n \nI could sit here and explain that the bible is pure bulls**t and we have absolutely no obligation to be sucked in to what a bunch of bible-thumping loonies think. And you'd probably sit there and realise that its true, that we really don't have to give a f*** about what the bible says, or what those intolerant XXXXXX think. But chances are that you won't, because it would mean stepping away from the herd, it would mean not going with the \"generally accepted\" beliefs and axioms. And nobody likes to go against the grain. We've been fighting so hard and so long for acceptance that going out on a limb would undermine all the effort we've already expended. At this point, what is important isn't truth, its security. \n\n \n I agree with the first part.\n In science, some \"generally accepted beliefs\" might actually be close to the truth, you know. \n \n What other scientific ideas do you think are politically motivated and based on bad science?\n \n \n \nYou'd probably read my posts criticizing the \"evidence\" for the gay gene and think to yourself Paul is full of s**t and is just like the rest of the gay bashers out there who want to blame us for our lifestyle and point condemning fingers at us. That is totally as far from true as possible. I criticize the studies and their conclusion because I happen to value truth above security. And I'm more than willing to be ridiculed for that.\n\n \n Huh?\n Who is Paul? You or the guy from Tarsus?\n Again, I ask why you single out this area of research as unreliable. And again, if you think that this subject is funded for political reasons by some mysterious pro-gay funding sources with the hope of providing fudged evidence to support pre-existing beliefs, I would like to know how you are reaching that conclusion.

   "If you're wondering how homosexuality got taken off of the classification of a disorder list back in 73, here is how they corrupted and perverted the science in order to accomplish, or should I say justify that move. And this also explains what unkerpaulie is referring to regarding the bad science used to change the way people look at this unnatural affliction.\n \n And lyteboy, I didn't argue that homosexuality is a mental illness ever, and neither did I even raise the issue. But that doesn't mean it isn't a physical affliction like so many others that affect small minorities of humanity. What this article shows though is that activist groups did aid in, and selectively choose and inform gay participants in studies, how to respond in order to make homosexuality appear normal and inherent in its practitioners. Basically offering one solid piece of evidence of what paulie suggested above. I know you'll attack the source as your M.O. demands, but that doesn't change the facts in the article.\n Before 1973 the American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychology Association, and the National Association of Social Workers recognized homosexuality as a formal disorder. A disorder is an abnormal physical or mental condition.\n \n The seminal scientific study used to normalize homosexuality appeared in 1957. Dr. Evelyn Hooker claimed that &#8220;homosexuals [are] not inherently abnormal and that there [is] no difference between the pathologies of homosexual and heterosexual men.&#8221; [3 Hooker, E., &#8220;The Adjustment of the Male Overt Homosexual&#8221; (Journal of Projective Techniques, 1957, \n 21, 18-31)] \n An honest scientist would have rigorously obeyed the rules for scientific experimentation in performing the tests on her hypothesis that male homosexuals will be indistinguishable in their performance on standard projective tests from male heterosexuals.\n \n An honest scientist would have used the existing standardized projective tests for psychopathology. Hooker ignored the existing standardized tests and invented her own.\n \n Hooker should have selected two groups of men, one homosexual, the other heterosexual, that were carefully matched for characteristics and who were kept ignorant of the purpose of the study.\n \n Instead, Hooker deliberately recruited homosexual men with the help of homosexual activist groups who told the homosexual men the purpose of the study was to transform society&#8217;s attitudes towards homosexuality. She later boasted publicly that, &#8220;I knew the men for whom the ratings were made, and I was certain as a clinician that they were relatively free of psychopathology.&#8221; [14 American Psychologist, April 1993 Vol. 48, No. 4, 450-453] She deliberately screened out subjects who admitted to being in therapy for mental or emotionally problems, thus insuring there was little risk of too many people revealing pathological symptoms on her projective tests.\n \n During her experiment Hooker was shocked to discover that her male homosexual subjects were revealing aspects of their personalities that conflicted with her theory. Each of her subjects was initially to be evaluated with three well-known psychological tests. When Hooker found that two of the three tests easily distinguished homosexuals from heterosexuals, Hooker simply omitted the results of the two tests that proved her hypothesis was wrong from her report.\n \n This piece of fraudulent garbage was the primary &#8220;scientific&#8221; report relied on by the American Psychiatric Association to decide that homosexuality was not a medical disorder.\n \n In 1965 Dr. Judd Marmor, a psychiatrist at UCLA, picked Hooker to be the chairman of the National Institute of Mental Health Task Force on Homosexuality. Marmor soon became Vice President of the American Psychiatric Association.\n \n So let's not make believe that liberal politics and manipulating scientific facts didn't play a major role in redefining how homosexuality is viewed by the scientific community.\n \n http://majorityrights.com/index.php/weblog/comments/misology_in_america_part_3scientific_fraud_homosexuality/",

Ignore the evidence the source reveals and attack the source at all cost. So here's more evidence that reveals what Hooker actually represented in the scientific community, and that is, a fraud.\n THE EVELYN HOOKER STUDY\n AND THE NORMALIZATION\n OF HOMOSEXUALITY\n \n by\n \n Thomas Landess\n Evelyn Hooker has been among the most influential figures in the highly successful movement to convince the American people that homosexuality is a \"normal variant\" of human sexual behavior. Her 1957 study, \"The Adjustment of the Male Overt Homosexual\" (Journal of Projective Techniques, 1957, 21, 18-31) is the most frequently cited scientific source for the argument that homosexuality is not a pathology, that homosexuals are as free from mental disorder as heterosexuals.\n \n Such assertions have not only found their way into standard psychology textbooks but have also provided a scientific basis for decisions in major court cases involving the legality of state sodomy laws and prohibitions against homosexual employment in certain state and local agencies (e.g., schools, police departments). Indeed, when the American Psychiatric Association debated the issue of homosexuality in 1973, Evelyn Hooker's work was Exhibit A for those who wanted to remove homosexuality from the group's list of mental disorders.\n \n For many commentators and activists, the Hooker study effectively ended the debate over whether or not homosexuals were in any way abnormal in their relationships with each other and with the community at large. Today many Americans have accepted the idea that homosexuality is \"normal\" and \"healthy\" without realizing that such an opinion is derived in large measure from a single study -- one conducted by a UCLA professor whose previous laboratory subjects had been rats.\n \n In all this extravagant homage to Hooker and her study, several points have escaped her admirers, to say nothing of the federal courts:\n \n 1. In her 1957 report, Evelyn Hooker did not use a random sample to test the stability of homosexuals, but allowed gay rights activists to recruit those homosexuals most likely to illustrate her thesis that homosexuality is not a pathology. Individuals who proved unstable were deleted from the final sample.\n \n 2. Hooker's published account of how she recruited heterosexual subjects is not consistent with a more detailed later account.\n \n 3. Six subjects in her study, three from each group, had engaged in both homosexual and heterosexual behavior beyond adolescence.\n \n 4. Hooker made several errors in her mathematical calculations that raise doubts about her care and competence as a researcher.\n \n 5. Hooker did not attempt to prove that homosexuals were normal in every way, nor does her study support the idea that homosexuals as a group are just as stable as heterosexuals.\n \n 6. Hooker was relatively inexperienced in administering the Rorschach test, and this inexperience may have led to mistakes in the administration and evaluation of the Rorschach.\n \n 7. On the Thematic Apperception Test and the Make-A-Picture-Story test -- which require subjects to make up fictional narratives about depicted scenes -- the homosexuals could not refrain from including homosexual fantasies in their imaginary accounts. For that reason, Hooker altered the nature of the study by no longer asking the judges to use the TAT and MAPS in an attempt to determine the sexual orientation of each of the 60 subjects, since the differences were apparent from the narratives.\n \n In order to understand fully the nature of the controversy over Hooker's study, it is helpful to review its history.\n http://members.aol.com/poesgirl/hooker.htm\n \n And here's another one for good measure that speaks to the origins of the group she buddied up to in order to accomplish her corruption of science.\n A report for the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality\n by researcher Jeffrey B. Satinover, cites Evelyn Hooker as \"more than anyone else\" the one whose work is responsible for normalizing homosexuality.\n \n Satinover writes that Hooker's work has helped the homosexual movement - in keeping with the Marxist theories from which it came - to convince judicial and legislative bodies such as the US Supreme Court that homosexuality comprises an oppressed \"class\" whose rights have been trampled by irrational prejudice.\n \n Hooker's work itself, however, was the product of a deliberate effort by homosexual activists to bring forward particular, pre-arranged outcomes, an approach that precludes scientific objectivity.\n \n While teaching at UCLA in the late 1940's, Hooker fell in with a group of homosexuals and the newly formed activist organization, the Mattachine Society. Founded by leading thinker and member of the US communist party, Harry Hay, the Mattachine Society members convinced Hooker to embark on a research study of homosexuality on their behalf in order to advance the movement. \n \n The study's subjects were selected entirely by the Mattachine Society, a group that Hooker herself admitted in the report had \"as its stated purpose the development of a homosexual ethic...\". In the same section she concedes the possibility that homosexuals are indeed pathological. The inadequacy of her methodology was acknowledged by the Journal of Projective Techniques that published it.\n \n In the study, \"The adjustment of the male overt homosexual\", Hooker administered three standard personality tests to two groups of 30 men, one homosexual and screened by the Mattachine Society and the other heterosexual. Despite the fact that the purpose of the study was ostensibly to examine the possibility of mental instability in homosexuals, individuals who showed signs of mental instability were removed from the groups, which further predetermined the study's conclusion.\n \n As with many other such \"groundbreaking\" studies seminal to the sexual revolution however, although Hooker's research has been criticised, and for all practical purposes debunked, the movement she helped to launch has not slowed.\n \n To this day, the Hooker study is the only paper referenced in detail on the main website of the American Psychological Association in its discussion of Gay and Lesbian issues. It was one of the two upon which, in 1973, the APA decided to remove homosexuality from the list of psychological disorders. It was the one study discussed in the APA's brief in 2003 in the Lawrence v. Texas case that struck down the criminal prohibition of homosexual sodomy in Texas.\n http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2007/jul/07071603.html\n \n So feel free to ignore or deny what these sources reveal about the Mother of the Homosexual Movement. After all, you can't very well admit that everything you believe is based on lies, corrupted science and fraudulent claims by a group of homosexual communists with a specific agenda. But those denials mean little in light of the documented evidence. ",

But if scientists specifically mention uncertainty, you whine because they've forwarded an uncertain claim.\n \n \nThe inadequacy of her methodology was acknowledged by the Journal of Projective Techniques that published it.\n\n A claim on a site with no sources or references.\n But, once again, we could accept merely for the sake of argument that this is true, and that it refers to more than uncertainty, and you still have all the rest to combat.\n \n \nI suspect you would just prefer to attack the multiple sources I have submitted here.\n\n But I do so legitimately. You provide a propagandist website with no sources or references. How many times do we have to go over this? I can post a page that says, \"Archie (of 4forums fame) says that he loves having hot, sweaty, homosexual intercourse with his preacher,\" but why would people accept that without a source?\n \n \nWhat must be acknowledged also is that all of the attacks and insults directed at me the last time we discussed this when I insisted that it was homosexual special interests that motivated the studies to change this from a disorder to a normal human function were unfounded,\n\n Only by XXXXXX. Beating down your dumbass arguments isn't an insult; if you feel bad, that's embarrassment and not my fault.\n \n \nand that I was absolutely and totally correct in my assertions.\n\n Again, not without bona fide sources. And refutation of all the other studies.\n Get to work.",

One could make anything a \n disorder with this logic. The onus to prove should be on those who attempt to make the argument that homosexuality is a disorder.\n\n \n I agree with you 100% Jake. My argument hasn't ever been that homosexuality is a mental disorder in any way. As far as it being a biological disorder such as minor abnormalities and deformities that afflict small minorities of humans though? I just don't know. The point of Hookers research and results though is relevant only because it has been so widely discredited in the face of electrolytes demands and attacks on me that to have even suggested what I did was bigoted and homophobic in nature when it turns out I was absolutely right in my original claims.\n \n And now he's fervently denying what is so painfully obvious regarding the very fraudulent work she did by breaking all of the scientific rules for protecting the integrity of a study. This same hypocrite who has on numerous occasions screamed at how committed and reliable scientists are in protecting the methodology is now completely denying what objective sources are saying about her very flawed, corrupted and even fraudulent research techniques. What Hooker did does irreparable harm to all of the claims that the homosexual movement now makes in regard to its legitimacy. \n \n And what's worse, as unkerpaulie has pointed out as a general concern, Hookers work has been adopted, held up, and built upon by other pro homosexual researchers in their attempts to validate and justify what homosexuality represents with similar outcomes of fraud and dishonesty. Laud Humphrey is one such example. Due to the perceived dishonest nature of his infamous research, his Ph.D. was later rescinded.\n Background\n \n Laud Humphreys was a student sociologist in the 1960's and attempting to earn his Ph.D. at Washington University at the time of his infamous research. Due to the perceived dishonest nature of his study, his Ph.D. was later rescinded by the university.\n \n Theory\n \n As a doctoral candidate at Washington University, Laud Humphreys began researching what he referred to as \"tea room trade\" or the act of fellatio between two anonymous men in public restroom. Using the work of Evelyn Hooker as a foundation, his goal was to understand this phenomenon and to determine a rationale and classification for particular sexual behaviors. Humphreys spent time learning about this practice and determined to become an insider so that he could study these behaviors. Focusing primarily on the restrooms in public parks, Humphreys made himself a regular where these activities were displayed. He offered to be a look-out and warn the participants about unexpected visitors such as police officers by making noise to interrupt the sexual act before the participants could be caught and possibly arrested. Humphreys wanted to track those he observed so he would note the license plate on the vehicle of the participant. He observed and interviewed participants without their full disclosure regarding his intent to conduct research. He also manipulated information to obtain home addresses and used these later to interview participants again.\n \n Results\n \n In total, Humphreys observed a time and place representative sample of 134 men and finally reported on 100 men due to attrition. He conducted 50 interviews in the tearooms and another 50 interviews with participants in their homes one year later, posing as a social health surveyor. In order for participants to open their homes to him, Humphrey's realized that he must change his appearance, demeanor and his automobile, so he did. None of the participants seemed to make the connection to their previous interactions with him. \n As Humphreys gained entry into this private system of instant sex, he learned that many (over 50%) of these men did not consider themselves homosexuals, were in fact mostly happily married, carried on very important roles in their respective communities and preferred to have quick sexual encounters, with few words and with men, all the while maintaining the appearance of being typical heterosexual males. \n In his work, Humphreys identified five types of homosexuals: adolescent male hustlers, ambisexuals, closet queens, gay guys and trade homosexuals.\n \n Commentaries\n \n Humphreys was committed to the research of this behavior and took considerable risks to conduct this single study. However, he was not able to gain support from those in academia due to his perceived unethical approach. While the members of the Sociology Department at Washington University did not award Humphreys his Ph.D.\n http://www.mcm.edu/~dodd1/TWU/FS5023/Humphreys.htm\n \n Now we start to see a pattern that pro homosexual scientists attempting to validate homosexuality as right and normal are not following the proper scientific methodologies required to insure an honest outcome. And here we see that Hookers fraudulent work was used to further Humphrey's dishonest study. This should be seen as very disturbing to anyone who is objectively concerned with an honest and forthright outcome of research that they are basing their beliefs, and world view on. Also, a simple google search will show that Humphreys is held up by the gay community today as one of its early Prophets of Homosexuality. Not very admirable to honor one who's work has been so denigrated due to its corrupted value.",

But not only consistent, but expected that rather than post any evidence what so ever refuting what these 4 sources show regarding Hookers shoddy and even fraudulent methodologies, that you would choose to just personally attack me. If my sources are false then prove it. That's what this debate forum is here for. Why must you and lyte attack and insult the poster rather than refute the evidence the poster offers if RIGHT is on your side?\n \n I believe this is why every debate with me gets derailed with insults over my motives and intelligence. Because as long as you guys can keep me sidetracked with defending against your personal attacks, you never have to face, confront or answer to the arguments I bring forth that you can't refute.\n \n Let's be clear here lesz. I have proffered 4 separate links that say the same exact thing about Evelyn Hookers work to normalize how homosexuality is viewed. I'm not even commenting on what is actually true or not. Only that there is no doubt by objective observers of scientific methodology that Hooker corrupted most every aspect of her reasearch in order to insure a specific outcome. The most concise description of her fraud is outlined here in her own biography:\n Commentaries\n Hooker has been criticized as having no clinical experience in the study of human behavior but undertook the study to prove that homosexuals could function as normal human beings. (Her homosexual friends instigated the study). Her methodology is also in question since she recruited her homosexual subjects from an organized group. Critics believe other inaccuracies in her research cast doubts on her reliability as a researcher.\n My question for you is, how is it furthering your agenda and credibility by personally attacking me once again, rather than just proving that Hookers research methods and outcomes were in fact done properly? Why hasn't one of you who oppose what I have posted, posted even one objective scientific link that isn't a pro-homosexual source to refute what the multiple links I have posted all agree is the truth about Hooker's, and I quote: The seminal scientific study used to normalize homosexuality appeared in 1957. Dr. Evelyn Hooker claimed that &#8220;homosexuals [are] not inherently abnormal and that there [is] no difference between the pathologies of homosexual and heterosexual men.&#8221; [3 Hooker, E., &#8220;The Adjustment of the Male Overt Homosexual&#8221; (Journal of Projective Techniques, 1957, \n 21, 18-31)] \n An honest scientist would have rigorously obeyed the rules for scientific experimentation in performing the tests on her hypothesis that male homosexuals will be indistinguishable in their performance on standard projective tests from male heterosexuals.\n \n An honest scientist would have used the existing standardized projective tests for psychopathology. Hooker ignored the existing standardized tests and invented her own.\n \n Hooker should have selected two groups of men, one homosexual, the other heterosexual, that were carefully matched for characteristics and who were kept ignorant of the purpose of the study.\n \n Instead, Hooker deliberately recruited homosexual men with the help of homosexual activist groups who told the homosexual men the purpose of the study was to transform society&#8217;s attitudes towards homosexuality. She later boasted publicly that, &#8220;I knew the men for whom the ratings were made, and I was certain as a clinician that they were relatively free of psychopathology.&#8221; [14 American Psychologist, April 1993 Vol. 48, No. 4, 450-453] She deliberately screened out subjects who admitted to being in therapy for mental or emotionally problems, thus insuring there was little risk of too many people revealing pathological symptoms on her projective tests.\n \n During her experiment Hooker was shocked to discover that her male homosexual subjects were revealing aspects of their personalities that conflicted with her theory. Each of her subjects was initially to be evaluated with three well-known psychological tests. When Hooker found that two of the three tests easily distinguished homosexuals from heterosexuals, Hooker simply omitted the results of the two tests that proved her hypothesis was wrong from her report.\n \n This piece of fraudulent garbage was the primary &#8220;scientific&#8221; report relied on by the American Psychiatric Association to decide that homosexuality was not a medical disorder.\n \n So try not to focus on, and attack my motives lesz, as I have no personal axe to grind with how homosexuality is viewed at all. But only that it's viewed honestly for what it is. And according to this info, it is absolutely true and proven that unkerpaulies concerns that much is claimed by the so called scientific community regarding the normality and rightness of homosexuality, but little has actually been proven in reality.",

   "If you're wondering how homosexuality got taken off of the classification of a disorder list back in 73, here is how they corrupted and perverted the science in order to accomplish, or should I say justify that move. And this also explains what unkerpaulie is referring to regarding the bad science used to change the way people look at this unnatural affliction.\n\n \n You wrongly claim that this is a physical \"affliction\".

That would include people in wheelchairs, people born without any limbs, and para or quadriplegics. To label any physical affliction as a sin is an atrocity.\n\n \n You insist that I'm wrong yet you proffer no evidence at all to support that claim. Why must only my side support what we say while your side can make any wild claims you like and expect them to be received just because you say them? Anyway, If it could be defined as a physical affliction, the question then remains as to what caused it. If it is the result of mans fall from grace and is perceived by God to be an unnatural function of the sinful nature then it most certainly stands to reason that it would be seen as a sin. But you do realize I assume that this whole debate is nothing more than arguing semantics since Gods word clearly condemns the practice of homosexuality as an unnatural sexual expression, so however you attempt to justify or normalize it is a waste of human effort as the only laws that will be respected in the end are those laws that God established.\n \n Also, notice how your whole premise that this thread is based on has been abandoned by your homosexual allies. Because the gay gene hasn't been proven to exist as you claimed and can't be used to prove homosexuality is not a choice at all. And since I have shown conclusively that the science that Hooker used to get homosexuality removed from the medical books as a disorder was fraudulently manufactured, you have effectively been stripped of all of the legitimacy the homosexual movement has gained under false pretense based on her work. And I understand that unkerpaulie and I aren't philosophical allies at all, but I have also proven him correct in his contentions that, and I quote: I think scientists are trying to prove that homosexuality is predetermined rather than a matter of choice, but I wouldn't call that science. \n \n Here's the rest of what he said regarding his doubts about the validity of the pro homosexual scientific standards so you don't accuse me of misquoting his intended message.\n \n \nLike I said, inconclusive at best. I think scientists are trying to prove that homosexuality is predetermined rather than a matter of choice, but I wouldn't call that science. \n \n You, and many, many others, take the results of these studies as evidence that homosexuality may be predetermined, and this is an easily acceptable position because it supports what you already believe about homosexuality. I'm not as eager to jump on that bandwagon because in my view, and from my understanding of science, if something \"may be evidence\" of a correlation between 2 things, then its not evidence, and should be treated as such. Nothing else I know of in science is founded on what \"may be a correlation\". \n \n However, I'm going to let the issue go. People are still going to believe what they want to believe.\n\n \n \nSuch as? I have never ignored any links to any studies that claim they've found evidence that people are born gay. Every one that I've disagreed with I've explained clearly why I felt either the method or conclusion was lacking. And exactly what hereditary traits are you talking about where the associated allele has not been discovered? \n \n Its not only this topic. I'm actually very sceptical about the study of behavioral science as a whole. As far as I know, the only behaviors proven to be controlled by genes are those caused by mental disorders. Homosexuality is not a mental disorder, but it is one of the few behavioral traits conveniently lumped together with them in order to justify the quest for the gay gene. And yet most gays don't seem to have a problem with this. \n [snip]\n You'd probably read my posts criticizing the \"evidence\" for the gay gene and think to yourself Paul is full of s**t and is just like the rest of the gay bashers out there who want to blame us for our lifestyle and point condemning fingers at us. That is totally as far from true as possible. I criticize the studies and their conclusion because I happen to value truth above security. And I'm more than willing to be ridiculed for that.\n\n \n I have also shown above, based on Humphrey's admittedly disgraced work which was built upon the false and fraudulent work of Evelyn Hooker that any legitimacy the homosexual movement claims to have garnered through these frauds is as false as the researchers that fraudulently manufactured the evidence these claims of homosexual normality is based upon.",

   "And let me throw out a question for those of you who want to find genetic evidence that homosexuality is predetermined in human beings from birth. If it was found that a gay gene could be identified, and that it showed up in approximately 4% to 8% of the population which it appears to effect, much like deformities, birth defects and other abnormalities that effect similar percentages of the general population. Wouldn't that be absolutely undeniable evidence that homosexuality is in fact a human aberration and should be sought to be destroyed just as medicine is attempting to wipe out all other birth defects that negatively impact the human race?\n \n Have you all considered that perspective when attempting to convince others and yourselves that homosexuality is conceived since birth, when it is widely known that you represent such a small minority of what is considered the norm? For example, here is a link of risks of birth defects. Based on the percentages, these might answer the origins of how and why homosexuality exists. And the only evidence of this aberration is a strong desire for same gender identification rather than the normal hetero attractions of the majority population. NOTE THE BOLDED BELOW: http://www.genetics.emory.edu/pdf/Emory_Human_Genetics_General_Population_Risk_for_Birth_Defects.PDF\n \n Chromosome abnormalities \n Chromosomes are structures in the nucleus of each cell that contain your genes. Problems involving chromosome material cause about 6 percent of all birth defects. A normal chromosome study on a pregnancy does not rule out the chance for all birth defects. \n \n Single gene defects \n A defect in a gene is seen in about 7.5 percent of all birth defects. Genes are what determine your traits. A child can inherit not only those genes responsible for their normal traits, but also disease causing genes that result in a birth defect. \n \n Multifactorial inheritance \n Multifactorial inheritance means that \"many factors\" (multifactorial) are involved in causing a birth defect. The factors are usually both genetic and environmental. About 20 percent of all birth defects are the result of multifactorial inheritance. \n \n Teratogens \n A teratogen is an agent, which can cause a birth defect. It is usually something in the environment that the mother may be exposed to during her pregnancy. It could be a prescribed medication, a street drug, alcohol, or a disease that the mother has, which could increase the chance for the baby to be born with a birth defect. About 4 to 5 percent of birth defects are caused by exposure to a teratogen. \n ",

But God forbid I touch on a sensitive subject on a thread someone else started. All of a sudden, I'm some evil and heartless hater for asking the tough questions. \n \n Well, get over it. This is a debate forum and you have no right to censor me after you started this thread and brought up the gene issue yourself. All I did was ask if you really considered all of the ways a positive result for that question could be interpreted.

What if the world was mostly gay, and gays could reproduce but heterosexuals couldn't? What if you were one of the minority heterosexuals, viewed as \"deformed\" and \"defective\" by the dominant homosexuals? What if the bible deemed Heterosexuality an \"abomination\"? What would you do then? What if self proclaimed Christians who claimed to be righteous were beating and murdering your fellow heterosexuals in the name of God? What if you truly loved a woman, and she loved you back, but you couldn't marry because of archaic right-wing laws?\n\n \n I think I would avoid forums like this one where people raise issues like you did knowing that there's a very good chance that the opposition might just respond with arguments I can't refute if I'm in denial about my minority lifestyle that has historically been viewed as unnatural. I would either avoid such situations, and hopefully, I would also turn to that bible you mentioned that condemned heterosexuality, and seek to understand if this God has a solution to fix me and give me peace in life. \n \n And what christians are beating and murdering homosexuals as a standard practice in this Country? Let's just investigate that prejudiced and very bigoted, not to mention anti-christian attack on my faith for a minute. My reading on persecuted homosexuals around the world shows that this link will show how good gays have it here generally speaking in comparison to more than 70 countries where homosexuality brings with it the death penalty. http://www.globalgayz.com/multi-national-news03-04.html#article16 , or Malaysia, http://www.malaysiakini.com/letters/85512 , And of course let's not forget the Nazi's http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,3360729,00.html , Or the chinese who still persecute gays http://acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~phalsall/texts/c-gays.html , or pretty much any Islamic Country. And don't forget Africa: http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb5037/is_200410/ai_n18258522 Now read about the violence that gays suffer under in most other Countries on Earth and then let's talk about the institutional violence you want to claim they are suffering under here from Christians like me, ok? And btw S&p, skin heads, neo nazi's and members of the white Aryans or the KKK aren't believers or followers of Christ as I am. So don't blame me for their crimes cuz I can assure you that we don't worship together, much less the same God.\n \n And while we're on the subject of fair treatment, and for all of you who will defend the UN against some complaint I'm sure to have about them in some future debate. Let me just make a simple and obvious point regarding the inconsistency in that elite body of so called human rights supporters. What I will show is that the UN is made up of different political factions that work together for certain agendas that have nothing to do with what's best for people like us in third world countries. What we have here is an Indian that has just been elected to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR) from the Asian group for a three-year term, getting the maximum number of 47 votes in a secret ballot. What makes a complete mockery of this vote, and his election to this post is the rest of the story, which I quote: Last week, however, India declined to stick its neck out on a resolution, put forward by Brazil and Finland, on human rights and sexual orientation, essentially opposing discrimination against homosexuals.\n \n Instead, India chose to go along with countries with 'questionable' records on human rights issues, like Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Libya and Egypt, and voted against the resolution.\n \n The official reason was that homosexuality (or same sex relations) is a crime under the Indian Penal Code, so how does one vote in an international forum for a resolution which is at variance with Indian law. And, with a PIL pending on the issue in court, the matter, officials said, was 'sub judice.'\n \n Unofficially, the delegation decided that homosexuality was not an issue that India needed to get worked up about, given the fact that there was so much pressure on it on issues as critical as human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir, custodial deaths, illegal detentions and so on. At institutions like the 53-member strong UNCHR, headquartered in Geneva, there is considerable behind-the-scenes activity and bartering for support on issues vital to each country, sources said. Something like \"I'll support you on this issue, if you promise not to vote against me on that resolution,\" sources explained.\n \n http://www.globalgayz.com/multi-national-news03-04.html#article4\n \n So the next time you want to complain about how bad homosexuals have it here in the USA, do some research and check out the real world. Like I have been saying all along, Gays aren't seeking equal rights in the USA at all. They are seeking special rights. If the American homosexual community was as humane and ministerial as they claim to be, they would be using their combined clout to helping the truly victimized brothers and sisters in foreign countries to receive humane treatment. But no, they only seek to complain and cry out for equality when every criminal injustice they suffer here has a law already on the books to protect them against. The homosexual community in this country represents the epitome of narcissism, hedonism, selfishness and greed. They care only about serving their own selfish desires without concern for the larger homosexual populations human rights and suffering under these either cult led Governments or atheistic Governments around the world. But what is known for sure is that no devout christian Governments are torturing or killing gays for being gay anywhere on Earth. Can you tell I'm riled up S&p? cuz I am and it's your lies and false assumptions about me at every level of your post that got me there.",

   "You disappoint me s&p. Do you actually consider this drivel a serious response to my post? You've done nothing but evade the points I made while obfuscating with your responses. Your side must respond with emotional drivel since you can't refute any of the evidentiary facts I have posted regarding Hooker and Humphreys and their fraudulent work getting homosexuality removed from the medical books as a disorder. You then get all emotional about my question about the reality of the interpretation of the results if a positive was determined regarding a genetic connection to homosexuality. You raised the issue, but because you have no evidence to support your claim that it's factual, you then interpret my question as insensitive based on smileys typical emotional outburst as he plays the poor me victim card, yet again. \n \n Here are most of my arguments from this thread, they all wouldn't fit on one post. But notice that all your side has done throughout it has been to attack me and my sources while none of you have actually posted any opposing evidence that refuted anything I have claimed at all. Is that your idea of debating issues? To just attack the opposition personally while never once posting anything to actually support your own claims, or refuting his? Now just hang around a while till the next debate when electrolyte, in his classic pomposity refers back to this debate and exclaims how you all kicked my butt once again. Do you see why this horse dung gets old for me? You people think that all you have to do is respond and that results in a victory. But never do you actually refute anything I offer with legitimate facts at all. Just more slanted and illogical opinions that are based on your very warped world view. So read and answer these arguments rather than attacking me for once if you truly want to impress me and also prove that you understand the concept of actually debating issues rather than just spouting emotional drivel.\n \n \nIf you're wondering how homosexuality got taken off of the classification of a disorder list back in 73, here is how they corrupted and perverted the science in order to accomplish, or should I say justify that move. And this also explains what unkerpaulie is referring to regarding the bad science used to change the way people look at this unnatural affliction.\n \n And lyteboy, I didn't argue that homosexuality is a mental illness ever, and neither did I even raise the issue. But that doesn't mean it isn't a physical affliction like so many others that affect small minorities of humanity. What this article shows though is that activist groups did aid in, and selectively choose and inform gay participants in studies, how to respond in order to make homosexuality appear normal and inherent in its practitioners. Basically offering one solid piece of evidence of what paulie suggested above. I know you'll attack the source as your M.O. demands, but that doesn't change the facts in the article.\n Before 1973 the American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychology Association, and the National Association of Social Workers recognized homosexuality as a formal disorder. A disorder is an abnormal physical or mental condition.\n \n The seminal scientific study used to normalize homosexuality appeared in 1957. Dr. Evelyn Hooker claimed that &#8220;homosexuals [are] not inherently abnormal and that there [is] no difference between the pathologies of homosexual and heterosexual men.&#8221; [3 Hooker, E., &#8220;The Adjustment of the Male Overt Homosexual&#8221; (Journal of Projective Techniques, 1957, \n 21, 18-31)] \n An honest scientist would have rigorously obeyed the rules for scientific experimentation in performing the tests on her hypothesis that male homosexuals will be indistinguishable in their performance on standard projective tests from male heterosexuals.\n \n An honest scientist would have used the existing standardized projective tests for psychopathology. Hooker ignored the existing standardized tests and invented her own.\n \n Hooker should have selected two groups of men, one homosexual, the other heterosexual, that were carefully matched for characteristics and who were kept ignorant of the purpose of the study.\n \n Instead, Hooker deliberately recruited homosexual men with the help of homosexual activist groups who told the homosexual men the purpose of the study was to transform society&#8217;s attitudes towards homosexuality. She later boasted publicly that, &#8220;I knew the men for whom the ratings were made, and I was certain as a clinician that they were relatively free of psychopathology.&#8221; [14 American Psychologist, April 1993 Vol. 48, No. 4, 450-453] She deliberately screened out subjects who admitted to being in therapy for mental or emotionally problems, thus insuring there was little risk of too many people revealing pathological symptoms on her projective tests.\n \n During her experiment Hooker was shocked to discover that her male homosexual subjects were revealing aspects of their personalities that conflicted with her theory. Each of her subjects was initially to be evaluated with three well-known psychological tests. When Hooker found that two of the three tests easily distinguished homosexuals from heterosexuals, Hooker simply omitted the results of the two tests that proved her hypothesis was wrong from her report.\n \n This piece of fraudulent garbage was the primary &#8220;scientific&#8221; report relied on by the American Psychiatric Association to decide that homosexuality was not a medical disorder.\n \n In 1965 Dr. Judd Marmor, a psychiatrist at UCLA, picked Hooker to be the chairman of the National Institute of Mental Health Task Force on Homosexuality. Marmor soon became Vice President of the American Psychiatric Association.\n \n So let's not make believe that liberal politics and manipulating scientific facts didn't play a major role in redefining how homosexuality is viewed by the scientific community.\n \n http://majorityrights.com/index.php/weblog/comments/misology_in_america_part_3scientific_fraud_homosexuality/\n\n \n \nLike I said, I knew you would attack the source, It's your M.O. after all. Ignore the evidence the source reveals and attack the source at all cost. So here's more evidence that reveals what Hooker actually represented in the scientific community, and that is, a fraud.\n THE EVELYN HOOKER STUDY\n AND THE NORMALIZATION\n OF HOMOSEXUALITY\n \n by\n \n Thomas Landess\n Evelyn Hooker has been among the most influential figures in the highly successful movement to convince the American people that homosexuality is a \"normal variant\" of human sexual behavior. Her 1957 study, \"The Adjustment of the Male Overt Homosexual\" (Journal of Projective Techniques, 1957, 21, 18-31) is the most frequently cited scientific source for the argument that homosexuality is not a pathology, that homosexuals are as free from mental disorder as heterosexuals.\n \n Such assertions have not only found their way into standard psychology textbooks but have also provided a scientific basis for decisions in major court cases involving the legality of state sodomy laws and prohibitions against homosexual employment in certain state and local agencies (e.g., schools, police departments). Indeed, when the American Psychiatric Association debated the issue of homosexuality in 1973, Evelyn Hooker's work was Exhibit A for those who wanted to remove homosexuality from the group's list of mental disorders.\n \n For many commentators and activists, the Hooker study effectively ended the debate over whether or not homosexuals were in any way abnormal in their relationships with each other and with the community at large. Today many Americans have accepted the idea that homosexuality is \"normal\" and \"healthy\" without realizing that such an opinion is derived in large measure from a single study -- one conducted by a UCLA professor whose previous laboratory subjects had been rats.\n \n In all this extravagant homage to Hooker and her study, several points have escaped her admirers, to say nothing of the federal courts:\n \n 1. In her 1957 report, Evelyn Hooker did not use a random sample to test the stability of homosexuals, but allowed gay rights activists to recruit those homosexuals most likely to illustrate her thesis that homosexuality is not a pathology. Individuals who proved unstable were deleted from the final sample.\n \n 2. Hooker's published account of how she recruited heterosexual subjects is not consistent with a more detailed later account.\n \n 3. Six subjects in her study, three from each group, had engaged in both homosexual and heterosexual behavior beyond adolescence.\n \n 4. Hooker made several errors in her mathematical calculations that raise doubts about her care and competence as a researcher.\n \n 5. Hooker did not attempt to prove that homosexuals were normal in every way, nor does her study support the idea that homosexuals as a group are just as stable as heterosexuals.\n \n 6. Hooker was relatively inexperienced in administering the Rorschach test, and this inexperience may have led to mistakes in the administration and evaluation of the Rorschach.\n \n 7. On the Thematic Apperception Test and the Make-A-Picture-Story test -- which require subjects to make up fictional narratives about depicted scenes -- the homosexuals could not refrain from including homosexual fantasies in their imaginary accounts. For that reason, Hooker altered the nature of the study by no longer asking the judges to use the TAT and MAPS in an attempt to determine the sexual orientation of each of the 60 subjects, since the differences were apparent from the narratives.\n \n In order to understand fully the nature of the controversy over Hooker's study, it is helpful to review its history.\n http://members.aol.com/poesgirl/hooker.htm\n \n And here's another one for good measure that speaks to the origins of the group she buddied up to in order to accomplish her corruption of science.\n A report for the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality\n by researcher Jeffrey B. Satinover, cites Evelyn Hooker as \"more than anyone else\" the one whose work is responsible for normalizing homosexuality.\n \n Satinover writes that Hooker's work has helped the homosexual movement - in keeping with the Marxist theories from which it came - to convince judicial and legislative bodies such as the US Supreme Court that homosexuality comprises an oppressed \"class\" whose rights have been trampled by irrational prejudice.\n \n Hooker's work itself, however, was the product of a deliberate effort by homosexual activists to bring forward particular, pre-arranged outcomes, an approach that precludes scientific objectivity.\n \n While teaching at UCLA in the late 1940's, Hooker fell in with a group of homosexuals and the newly formed activist organization, the Mattachine Society. Founded by leading thinker and member of the US communist party, Harry Hay, the Mattachine Society members convinced Hooker to embark on a research study of homosexuality on their behalf in order to advance the movement. \n \n The study's subjects were selected entirely by the Mattachine Society, a group that Hooker herself admitted in the report had \"as its stated purpose the development of a homosexual ethic...\". In the same section she concedes the possibility that homosexuals are indeed pathological. The inadequacy of her methodology was acknowledged by the Journal of Projective Techniques that published it.\n \n In the study, \"The adjustment of the male overt homosexual\", Hooker administered three standard personality tests to two groups of 30 men, one homosexual and screened by the Mattachine Society and the other heterosexual. Despite the fact that the purpose of the study was ostensibly to examine the possibility of mental instability in homosexuals, individuals who showed signs of mental instability were removed from the groups, which further predetermined the study's conclusion.\n \n As with many other such \"groundbreaking\" studies seminal to the sexual revolution however, although Hooker's research has been criticised, and for all practical purposes debunked, the movement she helped to launch has not slowed.\n \n To this day, the Hooker study is the only paper referenced in detail on the main website of the American Psychological Association in its discussion of Gay and Lesbian issues. It was one of the two upon which, in 1973, the APA decided to remove homosexuality from the list of psychological disorders. It was the one study discussed in the APA's brief in 2003 in the Lawrence v. Texas case that struck down the criminal prohibition of homosexual sodomy in Texas.\n http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2007/jul/07071603.html\n \n So feel free to ignore or deny what these sources reveal about the Mother of the Homosexual Movement. After all, you can't very well admit that everything you believe is based on lies, corrupted science and fraudulent claims by a group of homosexual communists with a specific agenda. But those denials mean little in light of the documented evidence. \n\n \n \nSure, if you're blind it doesn't. Here's your source right on the page I C&Pd. Hooker, E., &#8220;The Adjustment of the Male Overt Homosexual&#8221; (Journal of Projective Techniques, 1957, \n 21, 18-31)]  \n \n Since you're always talking about confirming science and following the proper steps to protect valid outcomes, I'm a little surprised that your ignoring the evidence while attacking the source I've posted. And what's more disturbing is that you don't find these blatant abuses of the scientific process problematic at all.\n In all this extravagant homage to Hooker and her study, several points have escaped her admirers, to say nothing of the federal courts:\n \n 1. In her 1957 report, Evelyn Hooker did not use a random sample to test the stability of homosexuals, but allowed gay rights activists to recruit those homosexuals most likely to illustrate her thesis that homosexuality is not a pathology.

So, just as I fore saw, you attacked and tore down the source without even trying to refute the information in it. Do you now see why I hate debating anything with you? It's because you don't debate issues and facts, you just attack sources and the poster.\n \n Here's another source that debunks her research as a matter of fact. http://www.mcm.edu/~dodd1/TWU/FS5023/Hooker.htm\n\n \n \nI've posted a total of four links that all agree on the shoddiness of Hookers methodology in coming to the conclusions she came to. So of course you will completely ignore that relevant aspect to what they are saying. Fine lyte, I knew you would at least be consistent in your style of attacking and insulting the sources while never actually refuting anything. But rest assured that the complete scientific, so called research that Hooker did that has led to the erasure of homosexuality as a disorder in the medical books is accepted as totally flawed, if not purposely fraudulent due to her agenda to attain a preconceived outcome before even starting the study. BTW, this link http://members.aol.com/poesgirl/hooker.htm has citations and end notes that support the sources for proving the illegitimacy of Hookers study and consequent outcomes.\n \n And all of your dancing around the issue and criticisms of irrelevant minutia in order to confuse the issue wont change that one bit. Here the part that got me...\n While teaching at UCLA in the late 1940's, Hooker fell in with a group of homosexuals and the newly formed activist organization, the Mattachine Society. Founded by leading thinker and member of the US communist party, Harry Hay, the Mattachine Society members convinced Hooker to embark on a research study of homosexuality on their behalf in order to advance the movement. \n \n The study's subjects were selected entirely by the Mattachine Society, a group that Hooker herself admitted in the report had \"as its stated purpose the development of a homosexual ethic...\". In the same section she concedes the possibility that homosexuals are indeed pathological. The inadequacy of her methodology was acknowledged by the Journal of Projective Techniques that published it. \n \n The inadequacies of the methodology of her study was documented by the journal that published her work if you want to look it up. I suspect you would just prefer to attack the multiple sources I have submitted here. What must be acknowledged also is that all of the attacks and insults directed at me the last time we discussed this when I insisted that it was homosexual special interests that motivated the studies to change this from a disorder to a normal human function were unfounded, and that I was absolutely and totally correct in my assertions.\n\n \n \nI agree with you 100% Jake. My argument hasn't ever been that homosexuality is a mental disorder in any way. As far as it being a biological disorder such as minor abnormalities and deformities that afflict small minorities of humans though? I just don't know. The point of Hookers research and results though is relevant only because it has been so widely discredited in the face of electrolytes demands and attacks on me that to have even suggested what I did was bigoted and homophobic in nature when it turns out I was absolutely right in my original claims.\n \n And now he's fervently denying what is so painfully obvious regarding the very fraudulent work she did by breaking all of the scientific rules for protecting the integrity of a study. This same hypocrite who has on numerous occasions screamed at how committed and reliable scientists are in protecting the methodology is now completely denying what objective sources are saying about her very flawed, corrupted and even fraudulent research techniques. What Hooker did does irreparable harm to all of the claims that the homosexual movement now makes in regard to its legitimacy. \n \n And what's worse, as unkerpaulie has pointed out as a general concern, Hookers work has been adopted, held up, and built upon by other pro homosexual researchers in their attempts to validate and justify what homosexuality represents with similar outcomes of fraud and dishonesty. Laud Humphrey is one such example. Due to the perceived dishonest nature of his infamous research, his Ph.D. was later rescinded.\n Background\n \n Laud Humphreys was a student sociologist in the 1960's and attempting to earn his Ph.D. at Washington University at the time of his infamous research. Due to the perceived dishonest nature of his study, his Ph.D. was later rescinded by the university.\n \n Theory\n \n As a doctoral candidate at Washington University, Laud Humphreys began researching what he referred to as \"tea room trade\" or the act of fellatio between two anonymous men in public restroom. Using the work of Evelyn Hooker as a foundation, his goal was to understand this phenomenon and to determine a rationale and classification for particular sexual behaviors. Humphreys spent time learning about this practice and determined to become an insider so that he could study these behaviors. Focusing primarily on the restrooms in public parks, Humphreys made himself a regular where these activities were displayed. He offered to be a look-out and warn the participants about unexpected visitors such as police officers by making noise to interrupt the sexual act before the participants could be caught and possibly arrested. Humphreys wanted to track those he observed so he would note the license plate on the vehicle of the participant. He observed and interviewed participants without their full disclosure regarding his intent to conduct research. He also manipulated information to obtain home addresses and used these later to interview participants again.\n \n Results\n \n In total, Humphreys observed a time and place representative sample of 134 men and finally reported on 100 men due to attrition. He conducted 50 interviews in the tearooms and another 50 interviews with participants in their homes one year later, posing as a social health surveyor. In order for participants to open their homes to him, Humphrey's realized that he must change his appearance, demeanor and his automobile, so he did. None of the participants seemed to make the connection to their previous interactions with him. \n As Humphreys gained entry into this private system of instant sex, he learned that many (over 50%) of these men did not consider themselves homosexuals, were in fact mostly happily married, carried on very important roles in their respective communities and preferred to have quick sexual encounters, with few words and with men, all the while maintaining the appearance of being typical heterosexual males. \n In his work, Humphreys identified five types of homosexuals: adolescent male hustlers, ambisexuals, closet queens, gay guys and trade homosexuals.\n \n Commentaries\n \n Humphreys was committed to the research of this behavior and took considerable risks to conduct this single study. However, he was not able to gain support from those in academia due to his perceived unethical approach. While the members of the Sociology Department at Washington University did not award Humphreys his Ph.D.\n http://www.mcm.edu/~dodd1/TWU/FS5023/Humphreys.htm\n \n Now we start to see a pattern that pro homosexual scientists attempting to validate homosexuality as right and normal are not following the proper scientific methodologies required to insure an honest outcome. And here we see that Hookers fraudulent work was used to further Humphrey's dishonest study. This should be seen as very disturbing to anyone who is objectively concerned with an honest and forthright outcome of research that they are basing their beliefs, and world view on. Also, a simple google search will show that Humphreys is held up by the gay community today as one of its early Prophets of Homosexuality. Not very admirable to honor one who's work has been so denigrated due to its corrupted value.\n\n \n So for once in your life, try responding to the evidence honestly without just dismissing it out of hand as you emotionally attack me as some insensitive christian. And then we'll have something to debate. But I'm sick of posting substantial info only to receive back emotional and juvenile drivel in return and be expected to respond to it seriously.",

   "Archie, I know you want to \"destroy\" gays, even though it is obvious homosexuality is not a birth defect, but have you considered the feelings of gays? What if they like being gay? What if they truly are in love, and you're trying to take away their right to love each other?\n \n Let me ask you a question. What if the world was mostly gay, and gays could reproduce but heterosexuals couldn't? What if you were one of the minority heterosexuals, viewed as \"deformed\" and \"defective\" by the dominant homosexuals? What if the bible deemed Heterosexuality an \"abomination\"? What would you do then? What if self proclaimed Christians who claimed to be righteous were beating and murdering your fellow heterosexuals in the name of God? What if you truly loved a woman, and she loved you back, but you couldn't marry because of archaic right-wing laws?\n \n \n I know you will respond with something like \"that preposterous! It could never happen, and its not happening\". But I'm asking, how would you feel?\n\n \n You don't understand Archangel. He can not go there as it is forbiden by his religious beliefs. He believes homosexuality is a sin, will allways be a sin, and that God will burn those unrepentant of that sin in hell for eternity. According to Archangels religious beliefs God will also burn those who help others continue to live in the sinfull state. Archangel must continue to help us overcome our sinful states and can not accept sin. So you see if he empathizes with us it is akin to acceptence of homosexuality and he too will go to hell. Archangel is trapped in a world of fear. Notice that when archagel quotes the bible it is most often the old testament. Notice that he Poopooed my thread on \"Jesus said some are born gay\"",

He can be the biggest git in the world, and it will make no difference. This appears to be a belief he is testing to its fullest, by insinuating that homosexuals are no more than deformed abberations, rather than decent members of society equal to himself.\n \n He and his kind with their hate-filled homophobic lifestyle are the true plague on society that will bring us all to our doom if not checked, but he plays victim when this is pointed out (as we have just witnessed).\n \n Smiley",

   "I would like to comment on Evelyn Hooker&#8217;s research as there has been misinformation posted about this. I tried to dig up her original paper, but couldn&#8217;t get access to an online version on a 1957 paper. Previous posts have submitted editorials (opinions) so I will do the same. I could not find the purported disagreements with her work from her colleagues nor by the journal which published her original paper as those posts assert. The posts that allude to this don&#8217;t actually include any references that support these positions (I think the refs were thrown in there for show), so I submit it is likely these don&#8217;t exist. Also, it seems crazy that the Journal of Projection Techniques would subsequently criticize a paper that itself published after its own peer review and editorial staff accepted the paper for publication. If they thought there were methodological problems, they would not have published it in the first place. \n \n I am doing this all from memory. \n \n Evelyn Hooker was not some rookie with a cause. She was a talented psychology researcher who had a problem with the research to date that suggested homosexuality was pathological. This was because the patients observed in those studies were already psychiatry patients or prison inmates, and those groups certainly might be predisposed to psychopathology. Moreover, the authors had an a priori assumption that homosexuality was a disease and were attempting to characterize it, not gainsay that assumption. It never occurred to anyone to find out whether that assumption was true. Hooker was concerned that these studies were all seriously flawed. \n \n This bothered Hooker. She knew many seemingly well-adjusted homos, so this didn&#8217;t make sense. That is called science. When accepted ideas conflict with observations, we choose to evaluate them. The method she chose was to look two groups, one hetero, one homo and see if there was any difference between them with regard to psychopathology. She got a grant from the NIMH. \n \n To recruit the homos, she looked to the Mattachine Society, a homophilic organization in the 50&#8217;s. If you can think of any other way of recruiting gay men in 1957, I would like to hear it. Certainly it was not a &#8220;random&#8221; sample, as she was looking for a particular attribute, homosexuality. Now, the limitation of this approach would be if members of that organization differed in mental illness from gays not in that organization. I don&#8217;t see how that would necessarily be true or that any difference would substantively matter with regard to mental illness. Neither did the reviewers nor anyone else among her colleagues. It is a valid method. \n \n Random samples are only necessary if one hopes to probabilistically compare the sample to a larger population. That was not what she was doing. She compared this group with an appropriately matched sample of heteros. \n \n She chose to use 3 accepted &#8220;projection&#8221; tests that were popular at the time, the Rorschach (inkblot) test, some draw-a-picture test and another I can&#8217;t remember. She did not administer these tests but they were performed independently by experts, and interpreted by others who were blinded to the sexuality of the subjects.\n \n There were two major findings: \n 1.

   "You disappoint me s&p. Do you actually consider this drivel a serious response to my post?\n\n \n Oh Archie, never specific.\n \n \n \nYou've done nothing but evade the points I made while obfuscating with your responses. Your side must respond with emotional drivel since you can't refute any of the evidentiary facts I have posted regarding Hooker and Humphreys and their fraudulent work getting homosexuality removed from the medical books as a disorder.\n\n \n Just because there may have been a fault in the work of the scientists who removed homosexuality from the \"defects\" book, doesn't automatically mean that homosexuality is a defect.\n \n \n \nYou then get all emotional about my question about the reality of the interpretation of the results if a positive was determined regarding a genetic connection to homosexuality.\n\n \n Where the heck did I do this?\n \n \n \nYou raised the issue, but because you have no evidence to support your claim that it's factual, you then interpret my question as insensitive based on smileys typical emotional outburst as he plays the poor me victim card, yet again.\n\n \n It was my mistake for using the term \"genetic\". Even though I believe that homosexuality may be genetic, I wasn't aware that there was so little evidence. I was more getting at homosexuality being pre-determined. But, you seem to agree with me by calling it a defect. I do not believe it is some form of defect, however I do believe that it is predetermined. \n \n \nHere are most of my arguments from this thread, they all wouldn't fit on one post. But notice that all your side has done throughout it has been to attack me and my sources while none of you have actually posted any opposing evidence that refuted anything I have claimed at all.\n\n \n But archie, you have done the exact same thing. Just because you're outnumbered does not make you the victim here.\n \n \n \n \nIs that your idea of debating issues? To just attack the opposition personally while never once posting anything to actually support your own claims, or refuting his?\n\n \n You have not supported your claims either. I posted a website, so have you. However you attacked my website and claimed it wasn't valid, but I'm not going on an anger rampage. I am trying to have a civil debate.\n \n \nNow just hang around a while till the next debate when electrolyte, in his classic pomposity refers back to this debate and exclaims how you all kicked my butt once again. Do you see why this horse dung gets old for me? You people think that all you have to do is respond and that results in a victory. But never do you actually refute anything I offer with legitimate facts at all.\n\n \n Mostly because a lot of the things you post cannot be proven or disproved. This puts us in a weird position, because we can only offer logic. However, you don't seem to accept logic. You want hard proof of things that cannot be proven (such as the existence of God).\n \n \n \nJust more slanted and illogical opinions that are based on your very warped world view. So read and answer these arguments rather than attacking me for once if you truly want to impress me and also prove that you understand the concept of actually debating issues rather than just spouting emotional drivel.\n\n \n Archie, you have to learn to be specific. I cannot respond to your insults when I have no idea what you're insulting. See, I quote some of what you said and respond. Its a good way to debate, instead of just responding to everything as a whole and calling it \"drivel\", because it leaves me guessing what you're really calling \"drivel\". I stated that I do not believe homosexuality is a choice. Is that \"drivel\" and \"illogical\"? I also stated that you were throwing insults at me. Was that the \"drivel\"? Are you afraid to quote and respond because you don't have any refutation?\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSo for once in your life, try responding to the evidence honestly without just dismissing it out of hand as you emotionally attack me as some insensitive christian.\n\n \n So far, you have offered no evidence or even statements to deny being an insensitive Christian.\n \n \n \nAnd then we'll have something to debate. But I'm sick of posting substantial info only to receive back emotional and juvenile drivel in return and be expected to respond to it seriously.\n\n \n News flash, I posted substantial info too, and guess what I'm receiving from you?

We must take your word for it. \n \n If everything thing I've said is such cr*p and everything you've said is so true, why have I proffered supporting links to my claims and you have proffered nothing more than your opinion? If you're side is so right and I'm so wrong, and my sources are so flawed, it should have been easy by now for you guys to have produced something that proved that. But instead you have spent all of this time just insisting how right you are and how wrong I am. I admit that it's typical of your side and how you always debate me, but it doesn't prove you fallacious claims in any way. Let me be clear here:\n \n Evelyn Hooker, and the study she did that led to homosexuality being removed from the medical books as a disorder was completely flawed and fraudulently carried out by breaking most of the rules of proper scientific methodology. And just let me also interject here that I'm not even arguing that homosexuality is a disorder, either physically or mentally in any way. I don't have to, and that isn't my goal here. But all I have shown here is that reliable objective sources have documented how Hooker pretty much broke every scientific rule in the book in her quest to normalize how homosexuality is viewed by getting it removed from the books as a disorder. Here is why her work is so deceptive, dishonest and fraudulent at every level, this is just an excerpt:\n THE EVELYN HOOKER STUDY\n AND THE NORMALIZATION\n OF HOMOSEXUALITY\n \n by\n \n Thomas Landess\n Evelyn Hooker has been among the most influential figures in the highly successful movement to convince the American people that homosexuality is a \"normal variant\" of human sexual behavior. Her 1957 study, \"The Adjustment of the Male Overt Homosexual\" (Journal of Projective Techniques, 1957, 21, 18-31) is the most frequently cited scientific source for the argument that homosexuality is not a pathology, that homosexuals are as free from mental disorder as heterosexuals.\n \n Such assertions have not only found their way into standard psychology textbooks but have also provided a scientific basis for decisions in major court cases involving the legality of state sodomy laws and prohibitions against homosexual employment in certain state and local agencies (e.g., schools, police departments). Indeed, when the American Psychiatric Association debated the issue of homosexuality in 1973, Evelyn Hooker's work was Exhibit A for those who wanted to remove homosexuality from the group's list of mental disorders.\n \n For many commentators and activists, the Hooker study effectively ended the debate over whether or not homosexuals were in any way abnormal in their relationships with each other and with the community at large. Today many Americans have accepted the idea that homosexuality is \"normal\" and \"healthy\" without realizing that such an opinion is derived in large measure from a single study -- one conducted by a UCLA professor whose previous laboratory subjects had been rats.\n \n In all this extravagant homage to Hooker and her study, several points have escaped her admirers, to say nothing of the federal courts:\n \n 1. In her 1957 report, Evelyn Hooker did not use a random sample to test the stability of homosexuals, but allowed gay rights activists to recruit those homosexuals most likely to illustrate her thesis that homosexuality is not a pathology. Individuals who proved unstable were deleted from the final sample.\n \n 2. Hooker's published account of how she recruited heterosexual subjects is not consistent with a more detailed later account.\n \n 3. Six subjects in her study, three from each group, had engaged in both homosexual and heterosexual behavior beyond adolescence.\n \n 4. Hooker made several errors in her mathematical calculations that raise doubts about her care and competence as a researcher.\n \n 5. Hooker did not attempt to prove that homosexuals were normal in every way, nor does her study support the idea that homosexuals as a group are just as stable as heterosexuals.\n \n 6. Hooker was relatively inexperienced in administering the Rorschach test, and this inexperience may have led to mistakes in the administration and evaluation of the Rorschach.\n \n 7. On the Thematic Apperception Test and the Make-A-Picture-Story test -- which require subjects to make up fictional narratives about depicted scenes -- the homosexuals could not refrain from including homosexual fantasies in their imaginary accounts. For that reason, Hooker altered the nature of the study by no longer asking the judges to use the TAT and MAPS in an attempt to determine the sexual orientation of each of the 60 subjects, since the differences were apparent from the narratives.\n \n In order to understand fully the nature of the controversy over Hooker's study, it is helpful to review its history.\n \n THE HISTORY OF THE HOOKER STUDY\n \n Evelyn Hooker did not begin her research on homosexuals as a logical development in her career as a psychologist or even out of a dispassionate scientific curiosity. From all indications, she undertook the study to prove that homosexuals could function as normal human beings. As she herself said, \"How could my hypothesis have been anything else? I'd seen these men and saw nothing psychopathological in their behavior.\"[1]\n \n \"These men\" were the many friends she'd made in the Los Angeles homosexual community -- one of whom, Sam From, persuaded her to undertake the investigation. \"Now we have let you see us as we are,\" he said to the UCLA professor. \"It is your scientific duty to do a study of people like us.\"[2] Despite the fact that she was a \"rat runner\" -- with no clinical experience in the area of human behavior, she undertook her study, which would become, along with the Kinsey report, a prime weapon in the hands of the gay rights movement.\n \n It is important to examine carefully the manner in which Hooker planned and executed her research, which was funded by the federal government's National Institute of Mental Health. A number of commentators have failed to read Hooker's own report carefully or else have deliberately distorted her methods and findings for their own purposes. Here is just how she proceeded and what she found.http://members.aol.com/poesgirl/hooker.htm\n \n Knowing that you will attack the source rather than substance of this info, I took it upon myself to google Thomas Landess Bio. As a PHD and a longtime educator, it is obvious he has a solid understanding of the scientific method. And nothing in his background shows him to be against homosexuality at all. If anyone finds info to that effect, I knew nothing about. He seems to me to be an objective observer who is critiquing Hookers methods without having a personal vested interest regarding the outcome. \n http://www.yorktownuniversity.com/faculty/landess.html",

How come you always want to cut the debate short after getting to say your piece? And where does paulies reference say the twins were separated at birth? Or Is that just your added qualifier? Is it verifiable in any way that the studies reflect that the twins were separated at birth? I mean how many sets of identical twins did they find who were actually separated at birth, raised apart and then found as adults so they could be used for such a study as this type? \n \n Now finding identical twins who were raised together and interviewing them for such a study would be easy. But unfortunately for you, because they were raised together, the whole nature vs nurture question would come into it and since they were boys, it's very possible that the gay twin had an impact on the other twin to the tune of the 38% result shown in the link below. Obviously one would assume that if it was genetic, and one twin was gay, then surely they both would be, right? A statistical outcome and doesn't support the claim that its genetic at all. But it does support the idea that a familial influence plays some part, how ever minor in that statistical percentage. Here's a link that explains that belief.\n Interpretation\n Identical twins have identical genes. If homosexuality was a biological condition produced inescapably by the genes (e.g. eye color), then if one identical twin was homosexual, in 100% of the cases his brother would be too. But we know that only about 38% of the time is the identical twin brother homosexual. Genes are responsible for an indirect influence, but on average, they do not force people into homosexuality. This conclusion has been well known in the scientific community for a few decades (e.g. 6) but has not reached the general public. Indeed, the public increasingly believes the opposite.\n \n Identical twins had essentially the same upbringing. Suppose homosexuality resulted from some interaction with parents that infallibly made children homosexual. Then if one twin was homosexual, the other would also always be homosexual. But as we saw above, if one is homosexual, the other is usually not. Family factors may be an influence, but on average do not compel people to be homosexual.\n \n Twin studies suggest that as a class, events unique to each twin--neither genetic nor family influences--are more frequent than genetic influences or family influences. But many individual family factors (such as the distant father) are commoner than the individual unique factors. Unique events would include seduction, sexual abuse, chance sexual encounters, or particular reactions to sensitive events, when young. Everyone has their own unique path which only partly follows that of the theoreticians!\n \n A fascinating sidelight on all this comes from the work of Bailey (7). His team asked non-concordant identical twins (one was homosexual, one not) about their early family environment, and found that the same family environment was experienced or perceived by the twins in quite different ways. These differences led later to homosexuality in one twin, but not in the other.\n http://www.narth.com/docs/whitehead2.html",

   "The reason it makes no sense for me to continue this discussion is that we have two sides that are completely close-minded to the issue. One side rules out the possibility that sexual orientation can be chosen, despite the lack of conclusive evidence to support it, and despite the existence of testimonies of gays that say they chose to be gay. On the other hand we have christianity that juggles between labelling homosexuality as either a sinful choice (if one can choose to be gay) or a mental defect (if being gay is predetermined at birth). \n \n My position is that I am not convinced that homosexuality is predetermined because the evidence that supports that idea is poor, in my opinion. I could be wrong, and I'd love to see some real solid experiments that backs up those claims. Homosexuality being a condition one is born with was never one of my pre-existing beliefs, and I have no reason to be biased in that direction. That and the fact that I have personally experimented with homosexuality and it has never felt like an uncontrolable urge to be gay, yet neither does being heterosexual. I grew up in a christian home from childhood and I was programmed to be repulsed by homosexuality, as well as lots of other forms of sexual fetishes and practices. But as I grew up and shed away my christian beliefs, I don't have to allow that programming to steer my decisions. I have the option of indulging in sexual curiosities of my liking. If I were to become gay for the rest of my life, I wouldn't be able to honestly say that I \"felt gay all my life\". \n \n For other gays, the personal experirnce may be totally different from mine. Perhaps they truly felt gay all their lives. Perhaps their homosexuality developed in what seemed to be a natural way. I'm not discounting what they've experienced, but I can't take it as solid scientific fact, because it is what it is: personal subjective evaluation of their feelings. \n \n Just be wary of the beliefs you close your mind around.\n\n \n Obviously, you have determined to believe that sexual orientation is some sort of choice, despite the copious evidence against thatm, which you carefully avoid encountering so that you can say you haven't seen any.\n \n Further, no-one has ruled out the possibility of SOME social factors at work -- it's just that current scientific evidence doesn't support a major role for them, at least in the case of most gay people.\n \n Has it ever occurred to you to suppose you might be bisexual?

But this link implies that prenatal hormone levels may determine sexual orientation. But that theory is conflicted when viewed through the prism of the identical twin studies since identical twins would be exposed to the exact same prenatal influences across the board, whether they be hormonal, chromosomal or as is implied by some, genetic influences. NOTE THE BOLDED:\n Sexual Identity and Gender Identity.\n There are some aspects of identity that cannot be taken for granted, including sexual identity and gender identity. While most people are born prepared to feel comfortable with their body's gender, and to desire sexual contact with members of the opposite sex upon sexual maturity, there have always been a minority of people who do not fit this mold. Homosexual people are attracted to same-sex partners. Transgendered individuals are born feeling that they are actually a member of the opposite sex wearing the wrong body type, external characteristics to the contrary. The exact reasons for why these variations of human sexuality occur are not known definitively, but what evidence there is points to the influence of varying hormone levels on fetal brain development during pregnancy. Hormones appear to determine sexual preferences, and to condition the brain to think of itself as male or female. \n http://www.mentalhelp.net/poc/view_doc.php?type=doc&id=9699&cn=353\n \n What I find interesting regarding this info is that when I suggested prenatal influences like these in a debate with electrolyte recently, he mocked, insulted and attacked me as being an ignorant imbecile. \n ==============================================================================================\n This link discusses the possibility that POSTNATAL androgens in the brain that may determine behavioral development which would not conflict with twin studies. It would also nullify the genetic argument once and for all. What we are left with is that nothing is known for certain and much work needs to be done before any absolute determination can be suggested as an answer for this question of determining the origins of sexual preferences in human development. It is safe to say though, that a convincing genetic link hasn't been found at all.ABSTRACT\n Purpose\n \n Psychosexual development, gender assignment and surgical treatment in patients with intersex are controversial issues in the medical literature. Some groups are of the opinion that gender identity and sexual orientation are determined prenatally secondary to the fetal hormonal environment causing irreversible development of the nervous system. We reviewed the evidence in animal and human studies to determine the possible role of early postnatal androgen production in gender development.\n \n Materials and Methods\n \n An extensive literature review was performed of data from animal experiments and human studies.\n \n Results\n \n Many animal studies show that adding or removing hormonal stimulus in early postnatal life can profoundly alter gender behavior of the adult animal. Human case studies show that late intervention is unable to reverse gender orientation from male to female. Most studies have not permitted testing of whether early gender assignment and treatment as female with suppression/ablation of postnatal androgen production leads to improved concordance of the gender identity and sex of rearing.\n \n Conclusions\n \n Animal studies support a role for postnatal androgens in brain/behavior development with human studies neither completely supportive nor antagonistic. Therefore, gender assignment in infants with intersex should be made with the possibility in mind that postnatal testicular hormones at ages 1 to 6 months may affect gender identity. A case-control study is required to test the hypothesis that postnatal androgen exposure may convert ambisexual brain functions to committed male behavior patterns.http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022534705643388\n \n DEFINITION OF ANDROGEN: Androgen is the generic term for any natural or synthetic compound, usually a hormone, that stimulates or controls the development and maintenance of masculine characteristics in vertebrates by binding to androgen receptors.",

Neither you nor moose posted one bit of actual evidence refuting it at all. Only your slanted and biased opinions which are evidence of absolutely nothing.\n \n And just above this newest exchange I have posted more solid evidence regarding the issue of genetics and hormonal influences, both pre and post natal perspectives, in addition to paulies very insightful contributions, ALL of which you have just completely ignored. I guess that adds up to an obvious win for you, in your mind also, huh?

N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1007: 272-282 (2003). \n Gonadal hormones, particularly androgens, direct certain aspects of brain development and exert permanent influences on sex-typical behavior in nonhuman mammals. Androgens also influence human behavioral development, with the most convincing evidence coming from studies of sex-typical play. Girls exposed to unusually high levels of androgens prenatally, because they have the genetic disorder, congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), show increased preferences for toys and activities usually preferred by boys, and for male playmates, and decreased preferences for toys and activities usually preferred by girls. Normal variability in androgen prenatally also has been related to subsequent sex-typed play behavior in girls, and nonhuman primates have been observed to show sex-typed preferences for human toys. These findings suggest that androgen during early development influences childhood play behavior in humans at least in part by altering brain development.\n \n http://www.annalsnyas.org/cgi/content/full/1007/1/272",

So your claim \n\n Cut the victimhood ####. All your posts were addressed, you just won't admit it.\n was a definite error, right? I didn't expect you to admit it though. \n \n And why are you making such an absolute statement as if your claim is a proven fact? Isn't the question of how those young girls develop and mature once grown regarding the gender they are sexually attracted to left unanswered in the quoted link? So as usual, I must answer my own question because all I get from your side are biased opinions which received no serious objective thought at all. I googled CAH and came up with this link: http://www.congenitaladrenalhyperplasia.org/ And here's what it said regarding homosexuality.\n Will CAH make my child a homosexual?\n \n Whether a person engages in heterosexual or homosexual behavior is a choice made by the individual. While there may be factors that influence that decision, just as there are factors that influence whether a person will be more susceptible to alcoholism, it still remains a choice by the individual. There are some factors in relation to CAH that influence gender identity, whether physical, emotional or societal, but each of these can be dealt with. \n \n Having an enlarged clitoris makes a woman no less a woman than having small breasts would, but unfortunately there are those that try to imply that such superficial characteristic defines a person. \n \n The effects of elevated testosterone in women has not been conclusively examined. Some effects, such as aggressiveness, heightened libido, and slight changes in mental focus have been observed enough to be conclusive, but there has never been any conclusive proof that such influences forces a woman to become a lesbian.\n \n The crux of the problem is the societal ignorance that suggests any person outside of what's considered normal must be \"wrong\" or \"broken\". Young people in the confusion of puberty can be misled into thinking that any differences in their body, thinking or feelings are a sign that they are \"messed up\" and not normal, when they are as normal as any other teenager. The key is to reinforce your child's self image, specifically in relation to their gender. Assure them that they are fully male or female, and all that kids go through confusing times. \n \n -- Danny Carlton\n So it seems even with the hormonal imbalance, they are saying the gender identity remains an individual choice. This further works against the argument that hormones affect genetics which affects sexual identity. It seems no matter what direction we attack this issue from, from hormone imbalances to the pre-natal and post-natal influences, that people seem to have choices how ever you slice it. Here's the other post with 2 relevant links that explain the pre and post natal influences.\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=316623&postcount=103",

Think about that while you still have time to do the right thing.\n \n from the November 21, 2006 edition\n \n ATHEISM, NOT RELIGION, IS THE REAL FORCE BEHIND THE MASS MURDERS OF HISTORY\n By Dinesh D'Souza \n RANCHO SANTA FE, CALIF. &#8211;\n \n In recent months, a spate of atheist books have argued that religion represents, as \"End of Faith\" author Sam Harris puts it, \"the most potent source of human conflict, past and present.\"\n Columnist Robert Kuttner gives the familiar litany. \"The Crusades slaughtered millions in the name of Jesus. The Inquisition brought the torture and murder of millions more. After Martin Luther, Christians did bloody battle with other Christians for another three centuries.\"\n \n In his bestseller \"The God Delusion,\" Richard Dawkins contends that most of the world's recent conflicts - in the Middle East, in the Balkans, in Northern Ireland, in Kashmir, and in Sri Lanka - show the vitality of religion's murderous impulse.\n The problem with this critique is that it exaggerates the crimes attributed to religion, while ignoring the greater crimes of secular fanaticism. The best example of religious persecution in America is the Salem witch trials. How many people were killed in those trials? Thousands? Hundreds? Actually, fewer than 25. Yet the event still haunts the liberal imagination.\n \n It is strange to witness the passion with which some secular figures rail against the misdeeds of the Crusaders and Inquisitors more than 500 years ago. The number sentenced to death by the Spanish Inquisition appears to be about 10,000. Some historians contend that an additional 100,000 died in jail due to malnutrition or illness.\n \n These figures are tragic, and of course population levels were much lower at the time. But even so, they are minuscule compared with the death tolls produced by the atheist despotisms of the 20th century. In the name of creating their version of a religion-free utopia, Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, and Mao Zedong produced the kind of mass slaughter that no Inquisitor could possibly match. Collectively these atheist tyrants murdered more than 100 million people.\n \n Moreover, many of the conflicts that are counted as \"religious wars\" were not fought over religion. They were mainly fought over rival claims to territory and power. Can the wars between England and France be called religious wars because the English were Protestants and the French were Catholics? Hardly.\n \n The same is true today. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not, at its core, a religious one. It arises out of a dispute over self-determination and land. Hamas and the extreme orthodox parties in Israel may advance theological claims - \"God gave us this land\" and so forth - but the conflict would remain essentially the same even without these religious motives. Ethnic rivalry, not religion, is the source of the tension in Northern Ireland and the Balkans.\n \n BLINDLY BLAMING RELIGION FOR CONFLICT\n \n Yet today's atheists insist on making religion the culprit. Consider Mr. Harris's analysis of the conflict in Sri Lanka. \"While the motivations of the Tamil Tigers are not explicitly religious,\" he informs us, \"they are Hindus who undoubtedly believe many improbable things about the nature of life and death.\" In other words, while the Tigers see themselves as combatants in a secular political struggle, Harris detects a religious motive because these people happen to be Hindu and surely there must be some underlying religious craziness that explains their fanaticism.\n \n Harris can go on forever in this vein. Seeking to exonerate secularism and atheism from the horrors perpetrated in their name, he argues that Stalinism and Maoism were in reality \"little more than a political religion.\" As for Nazism, \"while the hatred of Jews in Germany expressed itself in a predominantly secular way, it was a direct inheritance from medieval Christianity.\" Indeed, \"The holocaust marked the culmination of ... two thousand years of Christian fulminating against the Jews.\"\n \n One finds the same inanities in Mr. Dawkins's work. Don't be fooled by this rhetorical legerdemain. Dawkins and Harris cannot explain why, if Nazism was directly descended from medieval Christianity, medieval Christianity did not produce a Hitler. How can a self-proclaimed atheist ideology, advanced by Hitler as a repudiation of Christianity, be a \"culmination\" of 2,000 years of Christianity? Dawkins and Harris are employing a transparent sleight of hand that holds Christianity responsible for the crimes committed in its name, while exonerating secularism and atheism for the greater crimes committed in their name.\n \n Religious fanatics have done things that are impossible to defend, and some of them, mostly in the Muslim world, are still performing horrors in the name of their creed. But if religion sometimes disposes people to self-righteousness and absolutism, it also provides a moral code that condemns the slaughter of innocents. In particular, the moral teachings of Jesus provide no support for - indeed they stand as a stern rebuke to - the historical injustices perpetrated in the name of Christianity.\n http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/1121/p09s01-coop.html",

Yet the event still haunts the liberal imagination.\n \n It is strange to witness the passion with which some secular figures rail against the misdeeds of the Crusaders and Inquisitors more than 500 years ago. The number sentenced to death by the Spanish Inquisition appears to be about 10,000. Some historians contend that an additional 100,000 died in jail due to malnutrition or illness.\n \n These figures are tragic, and of course population levels were much lower at the time. But even so, they are minuscule compared with the death tolls produced by the atheist despotisms of the 20th century. In the name of creating their version of a religion-free utopia, Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, and Mao Zedong produced the kind of mass slaughter that no Inquisitor could possibly match. Collectively these atheist tyrants murdered more than 100 million people.\n \n Moreover, many of the conflicts that are counted as \"religious wars\" were not fought over religion. They were mainly fought over rival claims to territory and power. Can the wars between England and France be called religious wars because the English were Protestants and the French were Catholics? Hardly.\n \n The same is true today. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not, at its core, a religious one. It arises out of a dispute over self-determination and land. Hamas and the extreme orthodox parties in Israel may advance theological claims - \"God gave us this land\" and so forth - but the conflict would remain essentially the same even without these religious motives. Ethnic rivalry, not religion, is the source of the tension in Northern Ireland and the Balkans.\n \n BLINDLY BLAMING RELIGION FOR CONFLICT\n \n Yet today's atheists insist on making religion the culprit. Consider Mr. Harris's analysis of the conflict in Sri Lanka. \"While the motivations of the Tamil Tigers are not explicitly religious,\" he informs us, \"they are Hindus who undoubtedly believe many improbable things about the nature of life and death.\" In other words, while the Tigers see themselves as combatants in a secular political struggle, Harris detects a religious motive because these people happen to be Hindu and surely there must be some underlying religious craziness that explains their fanaticism.\n \n Harris can go on forever in this vein. Seeking to exonerate secularism and atheism from the horrors perpetrated in their name, he argues that Stalinism and Maoism were in reality \"little more than a political religion.\" As for Nazism, \"while the hatred of Jews in Germany expressed itself in a predominantly secular way, it was a direct inheritance from medieval Christianity.\" Indeed, \"The holocaust marked the culmination of ... two thousand years of Christian fulminating against the Jews.\"\n \n One finds the same inanities in Mr. Dawkins's work. Don't be fooled by this rhetorical legerdemain. Dawkins and Harris cannot explain why, if Nazism was directly descended from medieval Christianity, medieval Christianity did not produce a Hitler. How can a self-proclaimed atheist ideology, advanced by Hitler as a repudiation of Christianity, be a \"culmination\" of 2,000 years of Christianity? Dawkins and Harris are employing a transparent sleight of hand that holds Christianity responsible for the crimes committed in its name, while exonerating secularism and atheism for the greater crimes committed in their name.\n \n Religious fanatics have done things that are impossible to defend, and some of them, mostly in the Muslim world, are still performing horrors in the name of their creed. But if religion sometimes disposes people to self-righteousness and absolutism, it also provides a moral code that condemns the slaughter of innocents. In particular, the moral teachings of Jesus provide no support for - indeed they stand as a stern rebuke to - the historical injustices perpetrated in the name of Christianity.\n http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/1121/p09s01-coop.html\n\n \n First, I think you term a \"radical gay\", as anyone who is not a doormat. That would be anyone who is not ashamed of being gay. I'd like to know who these homosexuals are who are lost for living the gay lifestyle. Are you saying we who are gay, are in fact straight? How else is a gay/homosexual to live? If we do live as gay, we're certainly not lost. If we are gay and try to live straight, like something we are not, logically we are then lost from ourselves. At some point you are claiming your lord made everyone straight, even when the evidence makes it clear we are not all heterosexual. You'll put your fingers in your ears. It's unwelcome information, which challenges your blind faith.\n \n As for the claims of carnage in the name of atheism, these are false. The fact that some 20th century dictators, having the most advanced weapons in history at their disposal, happened to be atheist, does not mean they did what they did for the purpose of spreading the atheist philosophy. However, we have plenty of examples of people saying they killed for the reason of their God, or to spread religious beliefs. This still goes on today of course. George Warmonger Bush said his God is not neutral. \n \n We stopped killing gay people in the West as the Enlightenment moved forward, and religion had less importance. In some places in the world, religion is still used to oppress gay people. The most enlightened places, where religion especially does not enter politics, have been the most advanced on gay rights. I'm thinking of the Netherlands, Scandanavia, and Canada.",

On the contrary foundit, you just prove that you have no better an understanding of Christ, the bible or Christianity itself to take these words as evidence of such a belief or proclamation as Hitler did, by saying them. I mean, Hitler said that \"he had a duty to be a fighter against the Jews as a good Christian\", and in this speech he was justifying the coming destruction of them. And here is another quote of Hitler making a similar point.\n\"The Catholic Church considered the Jews pestilent for fifteen hundred years, put them in ghettos, etc, because it recognized the Jews for what they were\".... \"I recognize the representatives of this race as pestilent for the state and for the church and perhaps I am thereby doing Christianity a great service by pushing them out of schools and public functions.\"(And into the Concentration Camps...)\n \n -Adolf Hitler, 26 April 1933, [cited from Richard Steigmann-Gall's The Holy Reich]\n\n WHAT THIS ANTI CHRISTIAN MAD MAN EVIDENTLY FORGOT IN HIS LUNATIC CHRISTIAN RANTS WAS THAT JESUS CHRIST HIMSELF, HITLER'S ALLEGED SAVIOR, WAS ALSO A JEW. SO BY PERSECUTING THE JEW, HE WAS PERSECUTING THE BLOOD LINE OF HIS SO CALLED CHRISTIAN SAVIOR So Hitler put on an air of religiosity as a politician in order to justify his anti-semitic hatred for Jews, but he had no more love or respect for christianity than does Osama Bin-laden.

   "First, I think you term a \"radical gay\", as anyone who is not a doormat. That would be anyone who is not ashamed of being gay. \n\n \n That's not my view at all Jake, I see the insane, emotional and off the wall statements that Jason made which I responded to above as radical and extreme. Him going back around 65 posts in order to find a quote of mine to attack me over is extreme. For him to freak out over my statement that Matthew save his victim status pleas for the gay pride parade, id radical and extreme, not to mention emotionally twisted.\n \n \nI'd like to know who these homosexuals are who are lost for living the gay lifestyle. Are you saying we who are gay, are in fact straight? How else is a gay/homosexual to live? If we do live as gay, we're certainly not lost. If we are gay and try to live straight, like something we are not, logically we are then lost from ourselves. At some point you are claiming your lord made everyone straight, even when the evidence makes it clear we are not all heterosexual. You'll put your fingers in your ears. It's unwelcome information, which challenges your blind faith.\n\n \n I know that you can't understand my thinking Jake. But I have explained the gospel perspective at least 100 times here. So if you haven't gotten it yet, then saying it again is seemingly a waste of time. It goes deeper than how the Lord made us though. It has to do with our sinful nature and the effect that has on us at our very cores. It is why we are all sinners in Gods sight and are equally tainted by the stain of sin at birth. We all need to be washed of this nature that we inherited from Adam which brought with it aging, death and disease, not to mention all manner of perverse and unnatural attractions that draw us away from the God who created us in love for fellowship.\n \n Have you noticed how in that whole explanation so far, there is no focus on homosexuals being any different or worse than straights in this battle for attaining holiness in this flesh? That's because there isn't any difference to God or His gospel of salvation. I constantly remind you that sin is sin to God and repentance, or \"turning away from it\" is what God requires from us in order to find victory over it. Sin is bondage that keeps us from realizing the fulness of our potential as human beings. But homosexuals refuse to accept that aspect of the gospel. They demand a special dispensation from God and expect Him to just give them a pass on His moral code which He designed for our protection.\n \n If homosexuality wasn't harmful to you, just as sins of the flesh are to straights, then God wouldn't condemn it, just as He condemns adultery and fornication for straights. As much as you refuse to accept this reality, you increase the rebellion that separates you from Him further. But it isn't Him who is changing or rejecting homosexuals in any way that He wont turn away from straights who refuse to repent. Because God can't be in the presence of sin, so He must reject it. Remember that God also created sex and all the pleasure that comes with it. We are sexual beings because He made us that way. But the reality is that perversions of Gods intended sexual expression exists. That is why the blood of Christ was shed for the sins of all men, both straight and gay. But you must receive that free gift. Just as I did and all who wish to be saved must. Just as the bible states that the life of man is in our blood, so is eternal life in the blood of Christ which covers our sins and washes us as white as snow spiritually speaking.\n \n \nAs for the claims of carnage in the name of atheism, these are false. The fact that some 20th century dictators, having the most advanced weapons in history at their disposal, happened to be atheist, does not mean they did what they did for the purpose of spreading the atheist philosophy. However, we have plenty of examples of people saying they killed for the reason of their God, or to spread religious beliefs. This still goes on today of course. George Warmonger Bush said his God is not neutral.\n\n \n I never claimed that atheistic dictators committed mass genocide for the purpose of spreading their atheistic philosophy; that would be a crazy way to win converts. I'm saying they did it because as atheists they have no moral center that allowed them to value human life enough to preserve it over their personal agendas, be they for political or for monetary gain. \n \n \n We stopped killing gay people in the West as the Enlightenment moved forward, and religion had less importance. In some places in the world, religion is still used to oppress gay people. The most enlightened places, where religion especially does not enter politics, have been the most advanced on gay rights. I'm thinking of the Netherlands, Scandanavia, and Canada.\n\n \n Let's get one thing straight Jake, regarding christianity at least. It isn't the move away from it and toward this alleged enlightenment you speak of that has stopped the killing of gays, because around 70 Countries still consider homosexuality a death penalty offense, and they aren't christian nations by any means, while America doesn't show to be any less spiritual today, yet homosexuals surely haven't lost any rights lately. And neither is my brand of Christianity out to oppress homosexuals. We are in a Sociological War for the morals and value system of a civilization you and I. Your side is attempting to redefine a traditional values system which my side is attempting to preserve. It's as simple as that my friend. \n \n Traditionalists oppose the moral influence your community is forcing on us at every level. From popular culture to your influence in the educational system and the indoctrination we see being imposed on the next generation of Americans, namely our own children. Then through judicial and legislative activism, you are corrupting the constitutional construct in bypassing the historically normal routes in order to force your agenda on the majority. And then there is the example of the evelyn Hooker fraud in partnership with a communist organization that successfully redefined how homosexuality is viewed. It isn't even important that homosexuality isn't a mental disorder. What is relevant is that they didn't have enough faith in the process to trust the methodology that science relies on to maintain its credibility.",

You would have to be an idiot to hold to those beliefs.\n\n \n The only response I can make to any of this is, SO WHAT??? Many despots in history have committed mass murder in Gods name, does that means they are actually carrying out Gods will? As Zacherias beheaded civilians with a dull knife in Iraq before he was killed in a firefight, he yelled All&#257;hu Akbar, &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1571;&#1603;&#1576;&#1585;. Usually translated \"God is great\" Does that mean he was serving the interest of the living God or was it some demon he perceives as God? Believe me when I tell you it was a demon. Not the God of love who cares about the Iraqi people as much as He loves us. \n \n And Hitler WAS a cultural christian in that he was born into a gentile family. I have no qualms about that at all. My point is that he was in no way a true follower of Christ who possessed His Holy Spirit and was guided by Him. Because as Jesus Himself said, a house divided is a house fallen. So Hitler never could have been serving the will of Christ, a Jew, and have been so determined to kill as many Jews as he could reach. It makes no sense at all to even think such foolishness. \n \n As a politician who used any propaganda tools necessary to convince the German People that he was a righteous leader who could be trusted with his agenda, his religious ferver makes perfect sense as a tool to gain the trust of the masses. Like any false prophet, he said what was needed to win over the crowd. If he spoke of hatred for Jews and extermination of a people, he would have awakened the conscience of the people and failed at gaining their trust. \n \n But by promising a return to their former glory and to neutralize any threats that stood in their way, and that he is serving God in cleansing and purging Germany of the elements that were sucking the life blood, as in the banking system and wealth of the people which Jews controlled, and homosexuals which represented immorality, and gypsies which existed within an underground economy, God will give us the strength to over come these enemies of the State, he was creating an us against them scenario and a justification for ridding Germany of these sappers of their energy and life blood. No lyte, Hitler wasn't a christian at all, and it is very likely that he had no belief in any type of judgement before a creator after death, or he would have considered the consequences of his actions in life. But he was a false prophet, and even could be called a minor anti-christ. A minor precursor of the coming of the final anti-christ.",

   "Just out of curiousity Archie, if Hitler had just approached Jews IN THE SAME WAY YOU APPROACH GAYS, would Hitler have been admirable then?\n Would you consider him a true Christian?\n\n \n So you're comparing his treatment of a RACE of people to how traditionalists respond the the immorality that we believe your sub culture of homosexuality represents. There is no correlation what so ever foundit. First your side compares yourselves to the black plight for equality. Now you're comparing yourselves to the extermination of the Jews. Is there no end to your need to paint yourselves as perpetual victims.\n \n \nWhile there is the admitted difference that you don't espouse killing gays, there are numerous similarities in the ways you approach gays and the issue of homosexuality and the way Hitler addressed Judaism.\n\n \n There is no similarity in how I approach the treatment of homosexuals as compared to how Hitler did. And only someone who is in total denial of both history and reality would say such a thing. I never condoned or endorsed any type of violence against homosexuals in any way. In fact, rather than even wasting time defending against such tripe, I'll just repost what I have already said.\n \n \nLet's get one thing straight Jake, regarding christianity at least. It isn't the move away from it and toward this alleged enlightenment you speak of that has stopped the killing of gays, because around 70 Countries still consider homosexuality a death penalty offense, and they aren't christian nations by any means, while America doesn't show to be any less spiritual today, yet homosexuals surely haven't lost any rights lately. And neither is my brand of Christianity out to oppress homosexuals. We are in a Sociological War for the morals and value system of a civilization you and I. Your side is attempting to redefine a traditional values system which my side is attempting to preserve. It's as simple as that my friend. \n \n Traditionalists oppose the moral influence your community is forcing on us at every level. From popular culture to your influence in the educational system and the indoctrination we see being imposed on the next generation of Americans, namely our own children. Then through judicial and legislative activism, you are corrupting the constitutional construct in bypassing the historically normal routes in order to force your agenda on the majority. And then there is the example of the evelyn Hooker fraud in partnership with a communist organization that successfully redefined how homosexuality is viewed. It isn't even important that homosexuality isn't a mental disorder. What is relevant is that they didn't have enough faith in the process to trust the methodology that science relies on to maintain its credibility.\n\n \n \nYeah.\n And Jesus was a man as well.\n As are gays, who you persecute.\n\n \n Prove it foundit. Whom do I persecute? When did I persecute them and in what way did I persecute them? According to my recollection, all I do is stand against you angry homosexuals here @ 4forums by standing against your unnatural lifestyle with my traditional values system. SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT FOUNDIT, AND I BOLDED AND CAPITALIZE THIS FOR EMPHASIS! ARE YOU STATING FOR ALL TO READ, THAT BY JUST DARING TO SHARE MY HONEST BELIEFS AND OPINIONS HERE AGAINST WHAT HOMOSEXUALITY REPRESENTS IN THIS GENERATION, IS INTERPRETED BY YOU AS ACTIVELY PERSECUTING THE HOMOSEXUAL COMMUNITY? \n \n Then it really is true that the liberal left is just fine with freedom of speech as long as that speech agrees with their philosophy, huh? Otherwise we are persecuting you and further denying you of your rights, right? You constantly prove with every statement you make that the only way you can communicate is by making yourself and your community perpetual victims. It's sad really, and tiring also as it just proves that the principles upon which your agenda is based is very weak since your community must use such manipulative tactics in order to gain public sympathy.\n \n \nThe same could be said of you.\n You do lip service for your \"religion\" to use it to condemn others.\n\n \n I have said it before foundit, I, nor any man has the power to condemn anyone at all. Only to discern whether or not what they represent is moral or not. But that is called discernment, not condemnation. \n \n \nI never claimed he wasn't.\n I think both you and he are religious posers,\n\n \n At least you're consistent in attempting to compare me to Hitler foundit. what better way to demonize an opponent than to categorize him with one of histories most evil mass murderers. It doesn't do much for a friendly debate, but why would I expect that from you?\n \n \nTo blame POLITICAL murders on \"atheism\" has as much sense as blaming Christianity because the Texas murdering mom killed her kids.\n \n\n You just don't get it. The reason why atheistic despots killed a hundred plus million people in a century is irrelevant to the fact that it was for political reasons or for greed, or for land. The important fact is that these leaders of Nations thought more of their own personal wealth and prosperity than they did the welfare of the people they were trusted to represent and protect. In the end, all that mattered to them was themselves.\n \n And yes, Amin was a moslem by birth. And I'm sure that means he couldn't have been an atheist, right? Here's his life story. And I do maintain that he was an atheist. You see foundit, I don't believe that men who actually believe in God could commit the atrocities that they did. I care about the life of bugs I find inside buildings because I value life so much.

   "And what, pray, is wrong with wanting to get religious approval?\n\n Because religion is based on lies, manipulation and mass oppression. Its doubly ironic that you're speaking on behalf of gays that are suckered into needing religious justification yet are looking to science for the very reason they can prove the bible is wrong. Its literally wrapping one deception around another. And just like you are peeved when someone doesn't buy into the born-gay bandwagon, I'm more peeved at people who buy deception wholesale. \n \n \nBut one size doesn't fit all, here.

In my personal little reality, when two beliefs contradict each other, at least one of them MUST be false. The length of time this belief has been held, and the social consequences of letting go of that belief, has nothing to do with it. If it is found to be logically unsound, it has to go. \n \n But that's just me. There are some people who can hold on to beliefs they know are irrational.

Like the younger generation.\n \n What do you think their take on the whole situation will be?\n Do you think they're going to blindly follow the people with no proof?\n Or are they going to see this as yet another reason why the religious anti-gay crowd is just irrational and unreasonable, and be more swayed towards the gay equality side?\n \n Quite frankly, I DO see a point in all this as to exposing the anti-gay religious right.\n And considering polls show that the younger generation views modern religion with skepticism, with a large majority seeing modern religion being irrationally opposed and fixated on homosexuality, and a large majority SUPPORTING gay rights, I DO see significance to this discussion.\n Any time you can convince the emperor to parade around without his clothes on, it's a fun ride! :p",

Because what's good for the goose is surely good for the gander right, foundit?\n \n Do you see how absolutely ridiculous and oppressive your way of thinking is foundit? You actually believe that by just disagreeing with you and choosing to exercise my rights at the ballot box is discrimination, when it is in fact just being an American. But when your side marches, protests, participates in, and promotes judicial activism which bypasses the legislative process, and pulls any sleazy trick you can think of to accomplish your agenda to force your unnatural lifestyle on the larger society, that is just seeking equality in your mind, right? And you can't even see the hypocrisy and criminal double standard that your twisted reasoning consists of, can you. \n \n \nThere are PLENTY of people around here who simply share their beliefs and opinions. And their beliefs and opinions are against gays.\n You distinguish yourself from them by your ADDITIONAL actions towards gays.\n THAT is what is different about YOU.\n\n \n You mean that I post links that expose studies like Hookers and Humphry's that show the shoddy and fraudulent work done in order to attempt to validate homosexuality and to make it appear right and normal at all cost, even when breaking all of the rules of scientific methodologies that you humanists cry so loudly that you respect? Are those the actions I do that offend you so much? That I force you to actually be honest, to the extent that that is even possible. And because I expose your lies with links and arguments that you can't refute? \n \n \nBut you're going to go in full Archie mode now, aren't you.\n Even though I explicitly explained why, you're going to LIE and pretend that it's just cause you have an opinion...\n\n \n Making excuses and falsely justifying what you represent is evidence of nothing foundit. And repeating your complaints is nothing more than useless redundancy, and I see no reason to continue to repeat myself by defending against the same slanderous lies.",

   "You know what would be hilarious if it wasn't so pathetic? Here you guys have unkerpaulie attempting to empower you with everything he said in his post. None of which is in agreement with anything I personally believe, but he's attempting to tell you that if you feel and believe that being homosexual is as right and normal as you argue that it is, and he isn't arguing that it isn't right and normal at all. He is simply saying that given that you truly believe that, then you don't need either the affirmation of, or the approval of any church or religion that you're OK as you are. And that using science and flawed studies to attempt to gain some legitimacy or approval is just a waste of time if what you already know to be true is true indeed. \n \n The question becomes, who are you really trying to convince that your sexuality is indeed a natural and normal sexual identity? The straight community, or yourselves?\n \n \nBecause religion is based on lies, manipulation and mass oppression. Its doubly ironic that you're speaking on behalf of gays that are suckered into needing religious justification yet are looking to science for the very reason they can prove the bible is wrong. Its literally wrapping one deception around another. And just like you are peeved when someone doesn't buy into the born-gay bandwagon, I'm more peeved at people who buy deception wholesale. \n \n Again here is a major juncture where our opinions differ. In my personal little reality, when two beliefs contradict each other, at least one of them MUST be false. The length of time this belief has been held, and the social consequences of letting go of that belief, has nothing to do with it. If it is found to be logically unsound, it has to go. \n \n But that's just me. There are some people who can hold on to beliefs they know are irrational. You might argue that they were also born that way. If someone wants to believe something illogical on the grounds that it makes them happy, more power to them. Its just something I won't do, and I speak out against it for that reason. \n \n The problem is we have this little thing called proof. I would have no problem with believing that homosexuality, or any aspect of behavior, is biological predetermined if I thought that the means they come up with such conclusions were sound. In my opinion, \u00fehe studies make unfounded presumptions and premature conclusions. The conductors of those very studies pepper there remarks with disclaimers and phrases such as \"might suggest\" and \"seems to indicate\" and what does the gay community do? Broadcast on the front page of their fansites: New Evidence for the Gay Gene!! And the article is thoroughly spun with the forgone conclusions that they've proven their pre-established beliefs. Meanwhile the scientists try in vain to recall the article stating that the results are preliminary at best, but its too late, already swallowed by the masses. \n \n Maybe I'm too critical and skeptical about things like these, maybe I'm born that way. But if the evidence isn't there to support it, I can't make myself buy it.\n\n \n \nemoticon_rolleyes \n I really think you don't understand the big picture of these studies.\n You describe them like the only reason for their existence is political motivation or personal reassurance.\n It isn't.\n \n Have you looked at the space shuttle research studies?\n http://www.kumc.edu/Pulse/resources/shuttle/tash.html\n Here is one that studies the effect of gravity on sperm.\n \n Would you conjecture that research project's purpose is to help make the impotent heterosexual men feel better? \"it's not my sperm. It's this fricken gravity!\"\n emoticon_rolleyes \n \n People research all sorts of stuff. Period.\n The genetic causes for a LONG LIST of things have been researched. Not just \"gay\" stuff.\n The way these discussions usually start is that some anti-gay guy will pop up and make some ridiculous innuendo about homosexuality's cause, like it's a choice. And then the conversation starts and takes on a life of its own, with people on your side of the fence trying to pretend that just having an opinion (or claiming life \"experience\") somehow gives validity to their claims, and proceed to ignore the volumes of evidence thrown at them.\n \n No. It's not.\n People want to KNOW stuff.\n There are TONS of research efforts which are guided by nothing more than just \"I want to know about ...\"\n \n Furthermore, I agree it's \"utterly pointless\", cause the religious people will either ignore the reality of the situation (continuing to insist it's a choice even though science has definitively proven it isn't and the \"choice\" crowd can provide absolutely zero evidence), or they'll concoct some apologetic excuse for it to be NOT a choice, yet they get to condemn it anyways.\n \n One of the funny things about this thread is how you have flip-flopped. You go on and on about how people against the idea of \"choice\" aren't giving you the benefit of the doubt, cause you've got this intangible \"experience\".\n Yet when Archie brings out an article linking homosexuality to PRENATAL HORMONES (hint: NOT a choice), you gobble it up and find it credible.\n emoticon_rolleyes \n You are a perfect example of how the religious crowd can contradict itself, even though you aren't arguing from that perspective...\n \n I agree nobody should discriminate, but you're very wrong about the \"shooting themselves in the foot\".\n I don't think you see this whole thing from the big picture.\n \n You've got the gay side, talking about the science behind the issue which shows point-blank NOT A CHOICE.\n And then you've got the anti-gay side, making up all sorts of inane claims and unsubstantiated arguments to try and ignore the whole thing.\n Now, take an independent third party and show them all this. Like the younger generation.\n \n What do you think their take on the whole situation will be?\n Do you think they're going to blindly follow the people with no proof?\n Or are they going to see this as yet another reason why the religious anti-gay crowd is just irrational and unreasonable, and be more swayed towards the gay equality side?\n \n Quite frankly, I DO see a point in all this as to exposing the anti-gay religious right.\n And considering polls show that the younger generation views modern religion with skepticism, with a large majority seeing modern religion being irrationally opposed and fixated on homosexuality, and a large majority SUPPORTING gay rights, I DO see significance to this discussion.\n Any time you can convince the emperor to parade around without his clothes on, it's a fun ride! :p\n\n \n \nOne of the problems with talking to people like you is that it seems you have this skewed perspective whereby your position is valid, until proven 100% incorrect.\n \n The word \"evidence\" does not imply 100% undeniable conclusion.\n If you're in a court of law, you have BOTH sides submitting \"evidence\". They aren't submitting things which definitively prove that they are 100% right.\n They are submitting things which SUPPORT THEIR CAUSE.\n And that's all we're really doing too.\n \n As for \"might suggest\" and \"seem to indicate\", have you read that many scientific articles?\n These words are typically peppered in REGARDLESS of the issue. Cause in science, theories aren't proven overnight...\n People find EVIDENCE for the theories, and look for contradictory evidence. They try to get the WHOLE picture before writing down a conclusion in ink.\n \n Science has already essentially come to the conclusion that genetics DO play a part in homosexuality. But unlike religion, they don't claim \"definitive\" until it's been proven for a long period of time...\n \n But on the flip side, can you find ANY proof of \"choice\"?\n Can you find any EVIDENCE to substantiate claims of \"choice\"?\n \n I really don't see how you can criticize us for our conclusions on \"genetics\" when you have absolutely NO evidence for \"choice\"... emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n \nThis was all explained to him long ago.\n \n Read this thread from 2005: http://4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=88652&postcount=1\n \n I guess the more things change, the more closed minds are determined to stay the same...\n",

   "I know that you can't understand my thinking Jake. But I have explained the gospel perspective at least 100 times here. So if you haven't gotten it yet, then saying it again is seemingly a waste of time. It goes deeper than how the Lord made us though. It has to do with our sinful nature and the effect that has on us at our very cores.\n\n \n If God is the creator of everything, God made our \"sinful\" natures.\n \n \nIt is why we are all sinners in Gods sight and are equally tainted by the stain of sin at birth. We all need to be washed of this nature that we inherited from Adam which brought with it aging, death and disease, not to mention all manner of perverse and unnatural attractions that draw us away from the God who created us in love for fellowship.\n\n \n Do you realize what the original \"sin\" was? It was at its essense, seeking knowledge over blind, blissful ignorance and obedience! We don't need to be cured of that human nature, to seek knowledge, we need to use it, with the goal of making fewer mistakes. Can you imagine one family living together, isolated in a walled garden? How would they reproduce except with one another? Talk about your unnatural attractions! \n \n \nHave you noticed how in that whole explanation so far, there is no focus on homosexuals being any different or worse than straights in this battle for attaining holiness in this flesh? That's because there isn't any difference to God or His gospel of salvation. I constantly remind you that sin is sin to God and repentance, or \"turning away from it\" is what God requires from us in order to find victory over it. Sin is bondage that keeps us from realizing the fulness of our potential as human beings. But homosexuals refuse to accept that aspect of the gospel. They demand a special dispensation from God and expect Him to just give them a pass on His moral code which He designed for our protection.\n\n \n No, there is clearly a difference in the way heterosexuals and homosexuals are treated when acting on natures. Unlike for the heterosexual, any acting on the part of the homosexual is considered a sin. It's the very nature of the homosexual which is tied to sin. Heterosexuality itself, is not considered sinful. This religiously pure sexual ideal, of the sexual being with no externalized sexuality, is as unrealistic for the gay person as it would be for the straight person. It's not going to happen. Although you can use it to take away people's rights, and compel them to hide in shame. Of course, you'd have to experience more in life than a Bronze-Age book written by sheepherders to draw towards that conclusion. You'd have to do more than blindly submit to stories and interpretations over thousands of years, full of cultural biases, and trusting ancient writers with agendas and questionable ethics by today's literary standards, to report truthfully and accurately.\n \n \nIf homosexuality wasn't harmful to you, just as sins of the flesh are to straights, then God wouldn't condemn it, just as He condemns adultery and fornication for straights.\n\n \n You're comparing apples and oranges again. See above.\n \n \nAs much as you refuse to accept this reality, you increase the rebellion that separates you from Him further. But it isn't Him who is changing or rejecting homosexuals in any way that He wont turn away from straights who refuse to repent. Because God can't be in the presence of sin, so He must reject it. Remember that God also created sex and all the pleasure that comes with it. We are sexual beings because He made us that way. But the reality is that perversions of Gods intended sexual expression exists. That is why the blood of Christ was shed for the sins of all men, both straight and gay. But you must receive that free gift. Just as I did and all who wish to be saved must. Just as the bible states that the life of man is in our blood, so is eternal life in the blood of Christ which covers our sins and washes us as white as snow spiritually speaking.\n\n \n \"Sin\", \"perversion\", \"gift\", the same few zealot talking points. None of it makes sense. How is it a \"gift\" to spend this life not being who you are? Because you'll then get to spend an eternity not being who you are?\n \n \nI never claimed that atheistic dictators committed mass genocide for the purpose of spreading their atheistic philosophy; that would be a crazy way to win converts. I'm saying they did it because as atheists they have no moral center that allowed them to value human life enough to preserve it over their personal agendas, be they for political or for monetary gain.\n\n \n Yeah, and the Biblical God allowed the Isrealites to commit genocide of other ancient tribes. Their tribe after all, was the chosen one. How do you know anyone was acting from an atheistic belief when they killed? Atheism isn't a moral system, but that doesn't mean atheists don't have ethics. Humanism is better defined as an ethical system. A good ethical system is based on reasoning. Atheists are certainly able to reason. Anything is possible if you put yourself above others, saying you are one of the chosen or the blessed. Saying God says it's okay, or God's self-appointed reps say it's good, is not reason. If you're wrong, there is no way to correct the situation. It's going back to that blind obedience and shunning of knowledge(in the form of a tree) in the mythical garden. \n \n \nLet's get one thing straight Jake, regarding christianity at least. It isn't the move away from it and toward this alleged enlightenment you speak of that has stopped the killing of gays, because around 70 Countries still consider homosexuality a death penalty offense, and they aren't christian nations by any means,\n\n \n Is it really 70? Anyway, you're speaking of other, societies, cultures and religions. I'm saying the Enlightenment did bring forward much progress in, at least the ability to question religion, and seek many other avenues for knowledge, in the West.\n \n \nwhile America doesn't show to be any less spiritual today, yet homosexuals surely haven't lost any rights lately.\n\n \n It's precisely because The U.S. still has Christian zealotry that gay people have to fight tooth and nail for any rights. There has been opposition to gay rights in Canada and some European countries for example, but it's nowhere near as powerful and as vocal, nor as organized as that opposition by religious zealots is in the U.S. Look at who is behind the \"ballot initiatives\" in the U.S., as we've already discussed.\n \n \nAnd neither is my brand of Christianity out to oppress homosexuals. We are in a Sociological War for the morals and value system of a civilization you and I. Your side is attempting to redefine a traditional values system which my side is attempting to preserve. It's as simple as that my friend.\n\n \n Yeah, that doesn't sound like you are trying to oppress at all! There's no exclusion to be found in that statement! Yikes, yeah I'm your friend all right, when I am demonized as a threat to everything moral and to all civilization! \n \n \nTraditionalists oppose the moral influence your community is forcing on us at every level. From popular culture to your influence in the educational system and the indoctrination we see being imposed on the next generation of Americans, namely our own children. Then through judicial and legislative activism, you are corrupting the constitutional construct in bypassing the historically normal routes in order to force your agenda on the majority.\n\n \n More exclusionary, divisive, and bigoted language. Care to give a reason why? No, of course you cannot. Because it's hot air rhetoric, irrational, blind, bigotry. Oh, the children, save the children! How original. And clearly this is only about all of us being sinners, gay or straight, from your perspective. Which must be why you argue that the minority is getting too uppity, thinking it can stand shoulder to shoulder with the majority group, and not stay in the shadows, several steps behind. Also highly original, and not at all oppressive.\n \n \nAnd then there is the example of the evelyn Hooker fraud in partnership with a communist organization that successfully redefined how homosexuality is viewed. It isn't even important that homosexuality isn't a mental disorder. What is relevant is that they didn't have enough faith in the process to trust the methodology that science relies on to maintain its credibility.\n\n \n How long are you going to keep harping on a study from mid-last century? Is that all you've got? Even if it was questionable, it doesn't mean gay people as a community are a threat to the broader community of people. That study doesn't mean we haven't learned much since then.",

Satan thought He meant a physical death, but He meant spiritually. That is how we got to this place as Gods children.\n \n \nDo you realize what the original \"sin\" was? It was at its essense, seeking knowledge over blind, blissful ignorance and obedience! We don't need to be cured of that human nature, to seek knowledge, we need to use it, with the goal of making fewer mistakes. Can you imagine one family living together, isolated in a walled garden? How would they reproduce except with one another? Talk about your unnatural attractions!\n \n \n Not at all Jake. The original sin was the act of disobeying God who warned us against the dangers of possessing the knowledge of EVIL. And you just prove that you have learned nothing since that original sin by still seeing it as an enlightening experience.\n \n \nNo, there is clearly a difference in the way heterosexuals and homosexuals are treated when acting on natures. Unlike for the heterosexual, any acting on the part of the homosexual is considered a sin. It's the very nature of the homosexual which is tied to sin. Heterosexuality itself, is not considered sinful. This religiously pure sexual ideal, of the sexual being with no externalized sexuality, is as unrealistic for the gay person as it would be for the straight person. It's not going to happen. Although you can use it to take away people's rights, and compel them to hide in shame. Of course, you'd have to experience more in life than a Bronze-Age book written by sheepherders to draw towards that conclusion. You'd have to do more than blindly submit to stories and interpretations over thousands of years, full of cultural biases, and trusting ancient writers with agendas and questionable ethics by today's literary standards, to report truthfully and accurately.\n\n \n What is relevant is that sin is sin to God. He warned us about it at every level and homosexuality is one type of fleshly sin which He warns us about. Deny it if you like. Reject it if you must. But Gods truth is the final truth and will ultimately be shown to be final arbiter regarding what is best for you. \n \n \n\"Sin\", \"perversion\", \"gift\", the same few zealot talking points.

The original sin was the act of disobeying God who warned us against the dangers of possessing the knowledge of EVIL. And you just prove that you have learned nothing since that original sin by still seeing it as an enlightening experience.\n\n \n The fairy tale was created by men in a patriarchal system. As humans began agriculture and started to civilize, to live in towns, men were worried their status would be lessened, because they were no longer heavily relied upon as the hunters and gatherers. Notice how Eve, the woman is especially blamed and punished in the story? In the Hebrew Talmud men are told to thank God everyday that they are not women. Men wanted to control and dominate. They created one fearsome, violent, angry, dominating, war-like and male, God, to achieve this. Don't question, just submit and obey, and be the good wife. It's about men's insecurity. And of course men don't want to be perceived as women. It's telling that where what is believed to condemn male homosexuality in Bibles, has been translated as \"effeminate\". \n \n \nWhat is relevant is that sin is sin to God. He warned us about it at every level and homosexuality is one type of fleshly sin which He warns us about. Deny it if you like. Reject it if you must. But Gods truth is the final truth and will ultimately be shown to be final arbiter regarding what is best for you.\n\n \n The truth is got at by questioning, reasoning, perceiving. Asserting your God is right, or the greatest, isn't an argument. It's closed-minded zealotry. We'd never have left the Dark Ages if we'd gone down that path. Everything you need to know about the world, is not contained in one very old book. \n \n \nYou can never know, or realize the answer to that question from your side of the veil Jake. But if you understood what comes with knowing and living for God, you would never even question the trade off.\n\n \n I know what comes. Religious zealotry, to the point where no other form of experience or knowledge in the world is anywhere in sight. \n \n \nYou keep telling yourself that Jake. Maybe someday you'll learn why atheists and humanists have absolutely no consistent moral center to speak of at all.\n\n \n There is no evidence of this. \n \n \nYou are all led by your own personal comfort zones with absolutely no moral absolutes at all between you. So how can you say that atheism is an ethical system of beliefs if there is no consistent ethical standards by which atheists are led?\n\n \n I think you don't want to think outside your religious dogmatic/zealot comfort zone. That's why you dismiss all other forms of knowledge(just like in the fairy tale garden), and back up every argument by saying you are correct because you're on the side of your God who is great. Atheism is simply a lack of belief in the supernatural, or a god, or gods or goddesses. That's what I meant when I said it's not a system of ethics. However, people can be ethical. They can reason a good system of ethics. We're convinced of something being good, ethical, by strong arguments.\n \n \nThe link from the UN said 70 Countries. And I'm saying that this alleged enlightenment is a non-existent figment of your imagination.\n\n \n Perhaps it hasn't come to all of the world yet. Constitutional democracy is not practiced in most of the world. That doesn't make it wrong. Equality of women? Laws against slavery?\n \n \nAs I pointed out above in this thread that every homosexual has ignored is that if homosexuality is ever proven to be genetic, your enlightened science and Society will immediately start finding ways to genetically cure it out of the human biology. Talk to me then about the enlightenment.\n\n \n Not unless the society wants everyone to be the same, and places no value whatever on diversity. At that point, it won't be just gay people who will have to worry.\n \n \nYour communities agenda is also powerful Jake. And it is your community which is attempting to change this Countries moral status quo, not mine. I marvel at how easily you turn this on us when it is your minority that is attempting to redefine my majorities value system.\n\n \n You are the minority, by your gay-hating, extremely religious values. Show me a poll where you are in the majority. There will be fewer and fewer of those. It's never just a minority that makes a change, and that change is happening.\n \n \nIt's homosexuality and immorality that threatens us Jake, not the people who promote it. You are as much a victim of your beliefs as those who oppose what you represent.\n\n \n Now what is that supposed to mean? How is that for a lucid argument supporting your side of the debate.\n \n \nNot at all Jake. It's the truth. Here it is again in the hope that you'll finally get it. Traditionalists oppose the moral influence your community is forcing on us at every level. From popular culture to your influence in the educational system and the indoctrination we see being imposed on the next generation of Americans, namely our own children. Then through judicial and legislative activism, you are corrupting the constitutional construct in bypassing the historically normal routes in order to force your agenda on the majority.\n\n \n There's not a grain of truth. First, how can a minority decide what is popular if the majority does not go along? Well, in regards to education, if you want your kids to be isolated from the world, there is always home-schooling. Otherwise, it doesn't have to follow your religious agenda. So what is this horrible lesson being taught to children? Is it to accept diversity? That last sentence of yours is really amazing. Gay people can use the courts and the legislature to defend their rights, like every other citizen. Who cares if you think we're stepping out of our place because you think you're a higher, more blessed class of human. What other route is there, constiutionally, other than the court or the legislature? I think anything that decides gays have rights is wrong in your view. It's quite clear why that's your opinion. \n \n \nBecause it speaks volumes about the fact that your community doesn't give a whit about truth or honesty when it comes to gaining the appearance of legitimacy. You same people who will argue about scientific methodology regarding evolution couldn't care less about it in reality, and the evos are no better in proving there false beliefs.\n\n \n Was Evelyn Hooker a lesbian?

   "Because religion is based on lies, manipulation and mass oppression.\n\n \n Well, this may be true, but so what? You ask why some gay people feel a need to reconcile their sexual orientation with their religion. Their reason may not be objectively rational -- no religious belief is -- but that doesn't mean it isn't real to them. And ultimately, it's the reality that goes on inside your head that counts for you.\n \n \nIts doubly ironic that you're speaking on behalf of gays that are suckered into needing religious justification yet are looking to science for the very reason they can prove the bible is wrong. Its literally wrapping one deception around another. And just like you are peeved when someone doesn't buy into the born-gay bandwagon, I'm more peeved at people who buy deception wholesale.\n \n \n Look, I'm peeved when people arbitrarily dismiss science while being relatively ignorany of what it teaches us. I'm peeved when folk with some agenda to grind call science deceptive, merely because science doesn't agree with their personal hobbyhorse. \n \n If you think most of us gay people aren't fixed that way biologically, when science tells us this is the explanation best supported by data, then why don't you prove your alternative? \n \n As for religious believers who are gay, I think they are just as wrong as religious believers who aren't. That doesn't mean I can't support them in wanting to find some system of metaphysical belief that they can be comfortable with, even if they choose one I, personally, think is incorrect. Or even if I think their preachers are lying to them.\n \n \nAgain here is a major juncture where our opinions differ. In my personal little reality, when two beliefs contradict each other, at least one of them MUST be false. The length of time this belief has been held, and the social consequences of letting go of that belief, has nothing to do with it. If it is found to be logically unsound, it has to go.\n \n \n Alas, you haven't proven the hypothesis that for most people, sexual orientation is innate, fixed biologically, to be unsound. It's supported by available data; alternatives are not. That it conceivably doesn't explain every instance of homosexuality doesn't mean it is disproven as a valid hypothesis -- if so, it would just mean that it wasn't a universal explanation for sexual orientation.\n \n However, I've seen no other that matches the available data so well.\n \n \nThe problem is we have this little thing called proof.\n\n \n Sorry, but a scientific hypothesis isn't a mathematical proposition. It isn't something you can formally proove, though you can empirically disprove it. The biological hypothesis has NOT been disproven; on the contrary, the evidence in its favour keeps mounting up.\n \n Again, one cannot prove that social factors never contribute under any circumstances. The possibility that occasionally they might doesn't disprove the biological basis for sexual orientation.\n \n \nI would have no problem with believing that homosexuality, or any aspect of behavior, is biological predetermined if I thought that the means they come up with such conclusions were sound. In my opinion, \u00fehe studies make unfounded presumptions and premature conclusions. The conductors of those very studies pepper there remarks with disclaimers and phrases such as \"might suggest\" and \"seems to indicate\" and what does the gay community do? Broadcast on the front page of their fansites: New Evidence for the Gay Gene!! And the article is thoroughly spun with the forgone conclusions that they've proven their pre-established beliefs. Meanwhile the scientists try in vain to recall the article stating that the results are preliminary at best, but its too late, already swallowed by the masses. \n \n Maybe I'm too critical and skeptical about things like these, maybe I'm born that way. But if the evidence isn't there to support it, I can't make myself buy it.\n\n \n It seems to me you've decided to reject all evidence that contradicts your preferred hypothesis. To you, for some reason totally obscure to all of us except, perhaps, our Archie, you feel a need to deny all possibility of a genetic basis to sexual orientation, therefore no \"proof\" could ever be sufficient for you.\n \n Here, you've left science and entered the faith-based world. I go by evidence, and the evidence of my personal experience, the testimony of other gay people, and objective sociological, psychological and physiological studies, all point in the direction of biological influence. Not genetic determinism -- biological influence.\n \n As a biologist, I can see that no single study is conclusive. No single study is perfect. No single study constitutes whatever it is in your mind would constitute acceptable \"proof\". The problem is that science just doesn't work with \"proofs\" in the way you seem to think it should. What we have is a consilience of evidence from a variety of sources that negates sociological and behavioural causes, and indicates biological ones, genes, hormones, antibodies, or whatever. Eventually, the actual mechanism will be cracked, but I'll wager you won't even accept it then.",

   "Archangel\n As I pointed out above in this thread that every homosexual has ignored is that if homosexuality is ever proven to be genetic, your enlightened science and Society will immediately start finding ways to genetically cure it out of the human biology. Talk to me then about the enlightenment.\n\n \n \nNot unless the society wants everyone to be the same, and places no value whatever on diversity. At that point, it won't be just gay people who will have to worry.\n\n \n You can remain in denial of reality all you like Jake, but the debate regarding this issue is taking place as we speak. \n If we eventually accept as fact that male homosexuality is genetically inherited, then the ethical logic that follows could go a number of different directions.\n \n To demonstrate this, we might begin with a couple of basic questions: Does the genetic disposition toward homosexuality limit the person's free will in the realm of sexuality? And, if so, what are the ethical implications of this discovery? Two answers are logically possible. On the one hand, a homosexual man could claim that because he inherited this gene and did not choose a gay orientation by his own free will, he should not be discriminated against, or judged, in any way different than another member of society. He could claim this because homosexuality could not be judged immoral, on the grounds that it is natural; or, even if society believes homosexuality to be immoral, he could not help the fact that he has inherited his particular genome.\n \n On the other hand, society could take the opposite road and refuse to accept homosexual behavior, even if it is proven to be genetically determined. Homosexuality could be accepted as a biological fact, but still be rejected socially, on the grounds that it lies outside of a culture's traditional, or preconceived, values and norms. In this way, homosexuality would parallel current societal views of other forms of unacceptable, though often genetically-based, behaviors, such as alcoholism and obesity. The underlying premise of this position is that innate genetic dispositions, though outside of a person's conscious control, do not excuse the behavior, trait, or lifestyle. We are then left with the unanswered question: Does our biological predisposition toward a specific behavior in itself make that behavior moral or immoral? \n http://www.counterbalance.net/genetics/orient-body.html\n Treating Faulty DNA\n \n An ethical issue which appears in both secular and religious discussions is the distinction between somatic therapy and germline enhancement. By \"somatic therapy\" we refer to the treatment of a disease in the body cells of a living individual by trying to repair an existing defect. Many ethical commentators agree that somatic therapy is morally desirable, and they look forward to the advances HGP will bring for expanding this important work. Yet, the ethically minded stop short of endorsing genetic selection and manipulation for the purposes of \"enhancing\" the quality of biological life for otherwise normal individuals or for the human race as a whole. We can speculate that the new knowledge gained from HGP might locate genes that affect the brain's organization and structure so that careful engineering might lead to enhanced ability for abstract thinking or to other forms of physiological and mental improvement. But such speculations are greeted with the greatest caution. Molecular hematologist W. French Anderson says,\n \n Somatic cell gene therapy for the treatment of severe disease is considered ethical because it can be supported by the fundamental moral principle of beneficence: It would relieve human suffering. Gene therapy would be, therefore, a moral good. Under what circumstances would human genetic engineering not be a moral good? In the broadest sense, when it detracts from, rather than contributes to, the dignity of man....Somatic cell enhancement engineering would threaten important human values in two ways: It could be medically hazardous....And it would be morally precarious, in that it would require moral decisions our society is not now prepared to make, and it could lead to an increase in inequality and discriminatory practices.\n \n In short, genetic enhancement risks violating human dignity by opening up the possibility of discrimination.\n http://www.counterbalance.net/genetics/soma-body.html",

But anyhow, this forum, no matter what facts you present, is based on wether or not you think gay marriage is acceptable or not.\n \n \nI see.\n So if a guy didn't call a black person a racial slur, but he wanted to ensure the black person was discriminated against legally in the law, like he couldn't vote, that would mean the person wasn't a bigot?\n\n \n Quote me on where I said \"Gays shouldn't have rights\", if you know so much. Gay marriage is pretty much... the only one. Like black people, gays can be productive, hard working, respectable American (or foreign) citizens, and for that, they deserve rights that straights have. But gay marriage isn't a right that anyone has unless you're in california. \n \n Marry - To join as husband and wife.\n \n Merriam Websters 2007.\n \n Until someone rewrites the dictionary, then guess what?\n \n \nOr, since you'll probably balk at \"black\", insert \"Jewish\" or \"woman\" or \"handicapped\" or \"Republican\".\n \n I'm sorry, but your approach does not preclude bigotry.\n\n \n I'm a bigot for being straight and feeling uncomfortable when gay guys start hitting on me, and for believing in the dictionary?\n \n I am also curious as to where I said \"Gays don't deserve rights...\". Gays deserve every legal right, I believe, except to marry one another. Go ahead, disagree. \n \n \nDo ANY of you anti-gay, zealotted, bible thumping Christians have any clue at all about your bible?\n\n \n More than you, friend. By the way, that was an evasion, not an answer. I was also wondering what you define as a \"anti-gay, zealotted, bible thumper\". Hmm... would \"Anyone who disagrees with you\" be somewhere in that ballpark?\n \n \nAnd before I get a complaint, I think MOST of the Christians on this forum are not of the \"anti-gay, zealotted, bible thumping\" variety.

A boring and inaccurate lie.\n\n \n Not in this debate - nothing that I couldn't respond to at least. Once again, this debate is not based on the effects that gay marriage would have, but wether gay marriage is acceptable or not.\n \n \nHonestly, I could care less what you think I \"can't debate on\".\n I debate on the issues that interest me.\n I have given facts plenty of times to substantiate my opinion.\n\n \n Isn't that what I've been saying the whole entire time?

There is some reliance on facts on religion and gay rights. But you're only trying to prove wether or not gay marriage is acceptable. \n \n On elections, gun control, etc., you have to prove more. It is a complex web of a virtually infinite number of scenarios, cause-and-effects, questions, etc. You have to prove \"If whoever wins the election, then this would happen to the economy\", \"If guns were banned then this would happen to crime rates\", \"There are double standards for right-wingers and left-wingers.\" etc. \n \n Debating gay rights is extremely easy, especially for those who have the \"bigot\" argument on their side.\n \n \nMaybe that's why you don't know certain FACTS about what your own bible says???\n\n \n Once again, you need to learn the basics before you can dig deep.\n \n \n \n \nFunny.\n\n \n Ah... the amused trick.

Is it my turn? Oh goody! Your debating style seems to rely heavily on discouraging your opponents, trying to make them seem (and feel) stupid, so that they become desperate because they believe that they're losing. When people become desperate, they'll do desperate things. I also believe that in this debate, I've mantained the same point, so I don't think that whether I changed the subject on other threads is relevant.\n \n \nGet over me already.

   "Well, this may be true, but so what? You ask why some gay people feel a need to reconcile their sexual orientation with their religion. Their reason may not be objectively rational -- no religious belief is -- but that doesn't mean it isn't real to them. And ultimately, it's the reality that goes on inside your head that counts for you.\n \n\n Cool. I don't worry about people who hold on to irrational beliefs. I have a problem with people judging \n me for not buying what I feel are irrational beliefs. You might have a million personal experiences and testimonies of millions of people, it doesn't make your belief true and I'm not going to pretend I believe it. \n \n \n \nLook, I'm peeved when people arbitrarily dismiss science while being relatively ignorany of what it teaches us. I'm peeved when folk with some agenda to grind call science deceptive, merely because science doesn't agree with their personal hobbyhorse. \n \n If you think most of us gay people aren't fixed that way biologically, when science tells us this is the explanation best supported by data, then why don't you prove your alternative? \n \n As for religious believers who are gay, I think they are just as wrong as religious believers who aren't. That doesn't mean I can't support them in wanting to find some system of metaphysical belief that they can be comfortable with, even if they choose one I, personally, think is incorrect. Or even if I think their preachers are lying to them.\n \n\n Like I said, this is where we differ in opinion. \n \n \n \nAlas, you haven't proven the hypothesis that for most people, sexual orientation is innate, fixed biologically, to be unsound. It's supported by available data; alternatives are not. That it conceivably doesn't explain every instance of homosexuality doesn't mean it is disproven as a valid hypothesis -- if so, it would just mean that it wasn't a universal explanation for sexual orientation.\n \n However, I've seen no other that matches the available data so well.\n \n\n I don't have to prove anything. I said that I'm not convinced, based on the nature of the studies, that sexual orientation is predetermined. I've explained in length why I disagree with the way the experiments were conducted and the narrow scope of the conclusions. I've clearly demonstrated how inconclusive and incomplete the findings were. I've shown how the articles that publicize these studies are clearly biased and full of blatant and unfounded presumptions that usually aren't even in agreement to the very scientists that conducted the studies in the first place. \n \n My position is that I believe that sexual orientation is not predetermined, and that choice and conditioning play greater roles than biology. I never said that its a fact that people choose their sexual orientation, nor that biology doesn't play a role at all. In fact I've repeated many times that I'd love to see actual proof that links biology to sexual orientation. I'm open to ANY definitive demonstration of sexual orientation being a direct result of a feature or condition one is born with. However, no such demonstration exists, so I am not obligated to believe in something I haven't seen proof for. You're the one making absolute statements so the burden of proof is upon you. \n \n \n \nSorry, but a scientific hypothesis isn't a mathematical proposition. It isn't something you can formally proove, though you can empirically disprove it. The biological hypothesis has NOT been disproven; on the contrary, the evidence in its favour keeps mounting up.\n \n Again, one cannot prove that social factors never contribute under any circumstances. The possibility that occasionally they might doesn't disprove the biological basis for sexual orientation.\n \n\n Interesting. The posibility exists that choice or social conditioning could be factors affecting sexual identity. One of the problems we keep running into with these survey-based studies is, how do you draw the line between the social/choice factors and biological factors. One of the classic gay gene studies (and one that still floats around frequently) was based on the amazing discovery that many gay men have uncles or cousins on their mother's side that are also gay. Therefore a gay gene must exist in these families. Maybe you don't understand how flawed this logic is, maybe you never will. This study doesn't even attempt to factor in the possibility that young boys growing up in contact with gay relatives could affect their lifestyles as adults. I mean, if the \"scientific study\" didn't mention it, that means it must not exist, otherwise they would have mentioned it, right? Its the same way that some families who've had a long history of becoming police officers must carry a law enforcement gene. Maybe the Gotti's have a mobster gene, or the Baldwin's have an acting gene. The possibilities are endless! Yay for science!\n \n I've yet to see one of these so-called studies offer a conclusion in support of predetermined sexuality. If there is one, I haven't seen it yet. So sorry, but maybe you have more faith than me when it comes to believing things that might not be true, more power to ya",

   "\n It seems to me you've decided to reject all evidence that contradicts your preferred hypothesis. To you, for some reason totally obscure to all of us except, perhaps, our Archie, you feel a need to deny all possibility of a genetic basis to sexual orientation, therefore no \"proof\" could ever be sufficient for you.\n \n Here, you've left science and entered the faith-based world. I go by evidence, and the evidence of my personal experience, the testimony of other gay people, and objective sociological, psychological and physiological studies, all point in the direction of biological influence. Not genetic determinism -- biological influence.\n \n As a biologist, I can see that no single study is conclusive. No single study is perfect. No single study constitutes whatever it is in your mind would constitute acceptable \"proof\". The problem is that science just doesn't work with \"proofs\" in the way you seem to think it should.

Obviously, there is no proof you would ever accept.\n \n \nInteresting. The posibility exists that choice or social conditioning could be factors affecting sexual identity. One of the problems we keep running into with these survey-based studies is, how do you draw the line between the social/choice factors and biological factors. One of the classic gay gene studies (and one that still floats around frequently) was based on the amazing discovery that many gay men have uncles or cousins on their mother's side that are also gay. Therefore a gay gene must exist in these families. Maybe you don't understand how flawed this logic is, maybe you never will. This study doesn't even attempt to factor in the possibility that young boys growing up in contact with gay relatives could affect their lifestyles as adults. I mean, if the \"scientific study\" didn't mention it, that means it must not exist, otherwise they would have mentioned it, right? Its the same way that some families who've had a long history of becoming police officers must carry a law enforcement gene. Maybe the Gotti's have a mobster gene, or the Baldwin's have an acting gene. The possibilities are endless! Yay for science!\n\n \n If you had actually followed the studies and metastudies, you'd realise that scientists aren't unaware of these issues, and control for social influence. Such studies have demonstrated that social influence, if any, is a weak and vague one. There has been no solid evidence found for your claim at all.\n \n Sorry, but the science just doesn't support your faith position.\n \n \nI've yet to see one of these so-called studies offer a conclusion in support of predetermined sexuality. If there is one, I haven't seen it yet. So sorry, but maybe you have more faith than me when it comes to believing things that might not be true, more power to ya \n\n \n You argue here like the Creationist who says that there is no single observation, no single fossil, that \"proves\" evolution happened. Therefore, the Creationist triumphally exclaims, evolution never happened! Sorry you don't see the utter and hopeless vacuity of this intellectual attitude. \n \n If you want to counter existing scientific evidence for the biological conclusion, you need to do better than make angry statements of faith.",

Everyone can digress (even you) except for me, huh?\n\n That's not what I said.\n I was pointing out that your criticism was false.\n I didn't make any comment on you \"digressing\".\n \n \n \nAnd... could you tell me where I said that?\n\n I said \"some people can...\"\n I never said YOU did...\n \n \n \nOnce again, I'd like these \"facts\" to be handed to me on a silver platter, so to speak.\n\n I'd like you to get your facts straight before you start criticizing me about my use of \"facts\"...\n Beyond that, I've explained how you can find them for yourself.\n \n \n \nLame strawman approach... hmm... I don't believe I heard my point being addressed in there.\n\n That's cause you're not paying attention.\n You insinuated I made a claim, which I didn't make.\n The fact that I pointed out it was a \"strawman\" should have made that quite apparent.\n \n \n \nYes. Now what?\n Nuetral.\n\n How can you be \"neutral\"?\n Either you feel they should be able to adopt, or you feel they should not be able to adopt.\n Where is \"neutral\"?\n \n \n \nOnce the definition of \"marry\" is permanently changed.\n\n Your reply makes no sense.\n If the definition of \"marriage\" is changed, to include gay marriage, there is no need for \"civil unions\".\n \n \n \nI believe I used the term \"marry\", not \"marriage\".\n\n 1) If you can't figure out the relationship between the two words, then ....\n \n 2) I guess I'll have to fill in the obvious for Ethmi...\n marry:\n 1 a: to join in marriage according to law or custom\n http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/marry\n \n Any other ridiculously stupid objections?\n \n \n \nI see an argument.

More people than JUST you read these posts.\n I was talking to anybody who reads ...\n \n \n \nPointing out a flaw is an evasion, you say?\n\n No.\n You refusing to address the link I have given for a third time now is \"evasion\".\n http://www.religioustolerance.org/god_cana.htm\n \n Yet NONE of this addresses the fact that the bible includes MULTIPLE acts where YOUR GOD COMMANDED genocide.\n All you did was show how the bible contradicts itself. Thanks for being helpful in that!\n It discusses numerous bible verses where YOUR GOD COMMANDED genocide.[/QUOTE]\n \n \n \nTrue. Too bad it's not LEGAL for gay marriage yet.\n\n I'll take it for granted that my ACTUAL point on your \"acceptance\" being irrelevant is still lost on you...\n \n \n \nToo bad it isn't unless you're in California, huh?\n\n Actually, Massachusetts as well.\n \n \n \nI see you like to generalize.\n\n I generalized nothing.\n I simply stated that there are other people like you.\n That is not \"generalizing\".\n \n \n \nOnce again, you've failed to present these \"facts\" directly to me. You can't tell me \"there are facts\" and expect me to believe you.\n\n Ethmi, I can't tell you virtually ANYTHING and have you understand it...\n So I'm not wasting time hand-feeding you more junk that you're going to misrepresent and fail to comprehend.\n \n You have already insisted on making a claim on me not using facts WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING to see if your assessment was true.\n \n \n \nI thought you said earlier that it was about \"Did God make gays gay?\"\n\n Silly me for taking for granted that you could see a connection between those two...\n \n \n \nOnce again, you haven't presented these \"facts\" to me.\n\n Actually, I quite prefer you to continue to say your false claim...\n Anybody who reads what I post will know you're full of it...\n \n \n \nThe real meaning of what you're alluding to is that debating for gay rights is easy because being prejudiced against gays lacks substance.\n\n \nOk. From now on I'll play along with gay guys when they hit on me.\n\n I only repeat this for the viewing audience to show how disconnected Ethmi is from ANYTHING I am saying.\n I could say \"apples\" and she'ld respond about orange groves\n \n \n \nUnless you can give me an exact number of how many times anti-gay people have been called bigots as compared to how often they get called bigots, well then...\n\n You suffer from a flaw I see repeated numerous times.\n You start out with your own assumptions on the world and others. You have shown that REPEATEDLY in numerous posts you have made on these threads.\n And then you demand others DEFINITIVELY prove you wrong, to 100% absolute certainty.\n \n Anything less and they're wrong.\n You're just too lazy to try and figure things out for yourself...\n \n \n \nYet it seems to be the backbone of the arguments of gay-marriage activists.\n\n Actually, that isn't part of any argument I have for why gay marriage should be recognized.\n But you show time and time again that you can't respond to somebody regarding what they ACTUALLY said...\n So you construct strawman and obfuscate...\n \n Your replies in this thread are little but one-liner mindless retorts.\n Only below do you even TRY to make a real response...\n \n \n \nWatch and learn, please.\n \"When the Lord your God brings you into the land you are entering to possess and drives out before you may nations...then you must destroy them totally. Make no treaty with them and show them no mercy.\" Deuteronomy 7:1-2, NIV. 1\n It is obvious that they cut out \"the Hittites and the Girgashites and the Amorites and the Kena'anites and the Perizzites and the Hiwwites and the Yebusites, seven nations greater and mighter than you\". \n Suppose you sit at a table, and a big guy gets up and glares at you. You somehow know that you can beat this guy in a fight, and you think the table is worth fighting over for some reason. Would you fight him?\n\n \"you think the table is worth fighting over\".\n IT IS NOT YOUR TABLE IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!\n I emphasized the line above that needs to be noticed.\n God was telling his people to GO INTO OTHER PEOPLE'S LAND, INVADE them, and TAKE OVER what belonged to the OTHER people.\n \n It would be like if Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait because God told him to...\n Whoops! Already happened huh...\n \n \n \n\"...do not leave alive anything that breaths. Completely destroy them...as the Lord your God has commanded you...\" Deuteronomy 20:16, NIV.\n I believe two verses earlier (20:14) it says \"Only the women, and the little ones, and the livestock, and all that is in the city, all its spoil, you take as plunder for yourself. Context leave things out.\n\n Yeah.\n Cause killing \"only\" the MEN is somehow okay...\n If you killed the women also, that would make it suddenly bad...\n < end sarcasm <\n \n Are you truly that far gone that you can't recognize the evil of genocide?\n \n \n \nYou don't have the right to comment when I say your biblical quotes rely on context. That's just how I feel. That's all.\n\n 1) There is NO context that justifies the biblical genocide.\n 2) You argue too much out of emotion.\n \n \n \nMessage has already been recieved. But I thought you would understand by now that I don't care whether or not you care.\n\n \nIf I don't care wether or not you do, doesn't that mean that I would take interest in arguing with you?\n\n While you're in your dictionary, look up \"consistency\"....\n \n \n \nWhere did I say \"I'm right\" on this thread. You are the one who has digressed from your debating style to gay guys and Biblical genocide, which I believe I debunked.\n\n 1) \"where did you say 'I'm right' on this thread\" ?????\n Are you for real?\n \n 2) \"digressed from your debating style\"...\n So you ADMIT that you were talking about my \"debating style\".\n And then you criticize me for commenting on yours.\n You are a true hypocrite.\n \n 3) \"to gay guys\"...\n Look at the fricken' title of this thread!\n Also, I was giving examples that proved your original claim wrong.\n \n 4) \"biblical genocide\"...\n The relevance of that was previously explained.\n \n \n \nI believe there's a difference between a legitamite question and an excuse...\n\n When you think of a legitimate question, let me know.\n Until then, stop insinuating I said thing I never said.\n LEARN to recognize an answer when you're given one.\n \n \n \nYou seem to lack the capability to defend your own debating style, so you digress to other things hoping you can win.\n\n The only \"attack\" on my debating style is your claim that I don't give facts.\n Which I have already proven false, but you can't seem to grasp that...\n \n \n \nI believe attacking debating styles is the backbone of your debates. Try debating without doing that.\n\n Says the person WHO ORIGINALLY BROUGHT THE SUBJECT UP...\n I am laughing my arse off at the idea that YOU want to debate MY \"debating style\" as you complain that I am commenting on yours...\n Talk about being hypocritical to an extreme!\n \n \n \nAlso, you seem to have ommitted some of my arguments, and added some of your own to compensate. Is that what you do when you can't think of an argument?\n\n You replying with a one-liner is NOT the same thing as an \"argument\".\n If you said something you want me to respond to, point it out explicitly.\n Otherwise, you really do say a lot of garbage that I should just plain ignore cause you obviously haven't a clue.",

For one thing, we can stop worrying about immortal souls and divine punishment. Obviously we won't stop making decisions, nor will we stop feeling as though they are \"free will\" ones. It won't affect rational systems of reward and punishment to encourage good behaviour and inhibit poor behaviour.

Just because I think genes constrain human behaviour, in the sense that they build a brain capable of it, doesn't mean that environment or circumstances cannot modify it or alter its expression. \"Genetic determinism\" is not something that biologists argue for, within limits. Sometimes, traits are genetically determined, but that doesn't mean that all traits are, nor that all behaviours are.\n \n Behaviour is a product of BOTH genes and environment. It's not nature OR nurture: it's both, and scientific wisdom lies in figuring out where each applies, and how much. Hence, it's interesting to analyse the degree to which a psychoogical trait such as sexual orientation is learned or innately fixed.

How could God hold her responsible and punish her for being decieved or manipulated, when she didn't know such things even existed??!!

I'd be very surprised if there are sermons at the mainline Christian churches, about how heterosexuals need to be forgiven for acting on heterosexuality. However, your religion would say it is wrongful for the homosexual to act on sexuality(no logical explanation why is ever provided), and at best, talks about forgiveness and tolerance. That wouldn't even be an issue for heterosexuality, because, hey, heterosexuality is just thought to be good and normal. One group is being negatively judged, and the other, left alone. Perhaps the issue of forgiveness and tolerance of gays, specifically, wasn't the point you were trying to make at the time. This topic more often than not, goes off on diversions, as there is no logical argument against gay rights. But am I really wrong and unfair about the position of yourself and your religion?",

If God is going to be brought up, as has been in this case, then there's no way to adequately discuss this without touching on or even discussing religious issues here. And the issue of atonement and the need for people to have forgiveness is very much a part of Christian religion. You may not agree, and that's your prerogative. No one is trying to force you to become religious. I disagree with your above statement--the issue of forgiveness very well might be raised as long as religion is discussed.\n \n \nIt's presumed natural and good for the heterosexual to act on sexuality.\n\n \n Within certain parameters, it's considered fine, yes. But religion often focuses on things other than sexuality even in context of heterosexuality. In other words, it focuses off humanity and onto spiritual aspects. Take some clergy for instance. They don't get to be \"heterosexual\" at all. What they get to do is to serve God and put away earthly matters. Even with non-priests--the laity--there is encouragement to focus on God and less on earthly issues. The point I'm trying to get across to you is that for my religion, the issue isn't so much gay versus God. It's things-that-distract-from-God versus God. For the Christian, Christ is to be supreme. The juxtaposition may, in fact, be a heterosexual relationship that needs to be avoided. Whether someone is gay or straight, or whatever, is really beside the point altogether.\n \n FWIW, I think that's why what you call the 'ex-gay movement' exists in religion: because it can. Religion really offers the only alternative to such a focus on sexuality in one's life. \n \n \nI'd be very surprised if there are sermons at the mainline Christian churches, about how heterosexuals need to be forgiven for acting on heterosexuality.\n\n \n What may come as a surprise for you is that there aren't many sermons in mainline Christian churches about homosexuals needing to be forgiven for acting on homosexuality. Again, the focus tends to be on atonement over being apart from God. I think you're trying to make an issue of trees when the real issue for Christianity (IMO) is the forest.",

   "How's this for a change of pace. Let's actually try to get this thread back on topic. And how come none of these so called intellectuals never told shooter that there is no evidence that homosexuality is genetic? Do you see how many kronuses you guys have pulled for attacking my valid evidence while not even correcting one of your own? It's as if you promote ignorance in your own troops. I guess that makes sense though cuz if they get well informed, they'll abandon the liberal tripe/propaganda they're being spoon-fed by the boatload. Maybe that explains why shooter has only posted 13 times defending his own thread. \n \n \nDoes anyone on this forum deny the proven fact that homosexuality is genetic? If it is genetic, then it is made by God, because according to the Christians, God made you and all your genes (with the help of your parents of course). If a gene includes homosexuality, then God made it. No one here ever chose to be heterosexual, so what makes them think that homosexuality is preventable, or a choice?\n\n \n \nDr Collins disagrees with you moose. It seems that although heritability is a factor in human traits, it doesn't mean it's inevitable at all. Choice still plays a part in what human beings become according to the Genome Project results.\n \n \"Homosexuality Is Not Hardwired,\" Concludes Dr. Francis S. Collins, Head Of The Human Genome Project\n  A. Dean Byrd, Ph.D, MBA, MPH\n \n April 4, 2007 - Dr. Francis S. Collins, one of the world's leading scientists who works at the cutting edge of DNA, concluded that \"there is an inescapable component of heritability to many human behavioral traits. For virtually none of them is heredity ever close to predictive.\"\n \n \n Dr. Francis S. Collins\n In reviewing the heritability (influence of genetic factors) of personality traits, Dr. Collins referenced the estimates of the percentage of various human personality traits that can be ascribed to heredity from the Bochard and McGue research.\n \n The heritability estimates for personality traits were varied: General Cognitive Ability (50%), Extroversion (54%), Agreeableness (42%), Conscientiousness (49%), Neuroticism (48%), Openness (57%), Aggression (38%) and Traditionalism (54%).\n \n Kirk et al. (2000) in their research using a community-based cohort of Australian twins reported a heritability estimate of 30% for homosexuality. Whitehead (1999, 2006) in his extensive review of the research cites 30% as the estimate of heritability for homosexuality as well, though he views the estimate as a maximum.\n \n Estimates of heritability are based upon careful analyses of studies conducted with identical twins. Such studies are important and lead to the conclusion that heredity is important in many of these traits. It is important however, to note that even in such studies with identical twins, that heritability is not to be confused as inevitability.\n \n As Dr. Collins would agree, environment can influence gene expression, and free will determines the response to whatever predispositions might be present.Dr. Collins succinctly reviewed the research on homosexuality and offers the following: \"An area of particularly strong public interest is the genetic basis of homosexuality. Evidence from twin studies does in fact support the conclusion that heritable factors play a role in male homosexuality. However, the likelihood that the identical twin of a homosexual male will also be gay is about 20% (compared with 2-4 percent of males in the general population), indicating that sexual orientation is genetically influenced but not hardwired by DNA, and that whatever genes are involved represent predispositions, not predeterminations.\"\n \n Dr. Collins noted that environment, particularly childhood experiences as well as the role of free will choices affect all of us in profound ways. As researchers discover increasing levels of molecular detail about inherited factors that underlie our personalities, it's critical that such data be used to illuminate, not provide support to idealogues.\n \n Citing such dangers, Dr. Collins referred to the book written by activist Dean Hamer who declared the discovery of the God Gene (this same author also is associated with \"discovering the gay gene\").\n \n Dr. Collins noted that the \"evidence\" in Hamer's book \"grabbed headlines,\" but was \"wildly overstated.\"\n http://www.narth.com/docs/nothardwired.html\n\n \n Here's his bio in advance, for those who will attack the person rather than the information.\n \n \nHere's Collins bio, I don't see a problem with him. Nothing about it implies he is anti-gay or has an axe to grind with homosexuality at all. And his accomplishments regarding genetics and science seem impeccable.\n Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D., a physician-geneticist noted for his landmark discoveries of disease genes, and his visionary leadership of the Human Genome Project (HGP), is director of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI).\n \n As head of NHGRI, Collins oversaw the HGP, the multidisciplinary, multi-institutional, international effort to map and sequence the 3 billion letters in the human DNA instruction book. Many consider this project to have been the most significant scientific undertaking of our time. The ultimate goal is to improve human health.\n \n With Collins at the helm, the HGP attained historic milestones, while consistently running ahead of schedule and under budget. A working draft of the human genome sequence was announced in June 2000, and an initial analysis was published in February 2001. HGP scientists finished the sequence in April 2003, coinciding with the 50th anniversary of Watson and Crick's seminal publication describing the double helix structure of DNA.\n \n But the exploration of the genome is really just beginning. Building upon the foundation laid by the HGP, researchers around the globe are now collaborating on a wide range of projects that are using genomic tools and technologies to expand understanding of human biology and combat human disease.\n \n NHGRI-supported initiatives currently include efforts to map human genetic variation, to develop less costly sequencing technologies and to unravel the genetics of cancer and other common diseases. Following the precedent set by the HGP under Collins' leadership, these projects are committed to making their data rapidly and freely available to the worldwide scientific community.\n \n Beginnings\n \n Raised on a small farm in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, Collins was home-schooled until the sixth grade. Throughout most of his high school and college years, the aspiring chemist had little interest in what he then considered the \"messy\" field of biology. He earned a B.S. in chemistry at the University of Virginia in 1970 and a Ph.D. in physical chemistry at Yale University in 1974. While at Yale, however, a course in biochemistry sparked his interest in the molecules that hold the blueprint for life: DNA and RNA. Collins recognized that a revolution was on the horizon in molecular biology and genetics. He changed fields and enrolled in medical school at the University of North Carolina, where he earned an M.D. in 1977.\n \n From 1978 to 1981, Collins served a residency and chief residency in internal medicine at North Carolina Memorial Hospital in Chapel Hill. He then returned to Yale, where he was named a Fellow in Human Genetics at the medical school from 1981 to 1984. During that time, he developed innovative methods of crossing large stretches of DNA to identify disease genes.\n \n After joining the University of Michigan in 1984 in a position that would eventually lead to a Professorship of Internal Medicine and Human Genetics, Collins heightened his reputation as a relentless gene hunter. That gene-hunting approach, which he named \"positional cloning,\" has developed into a powerful component of modern molecular genetics.\n \n In contrast to previous methods for finding genes, positional cloning enabled scientists to identify disease genes without knowing in advance what the functional abnormality underlying the disease might be. Collins' team, together with collaborators, applied the new approach in 1989 in their successful quest for the long-sought gene responsible for cystic fibrosis. Other major discoveries soon followed, including isolation of the genes for Huntington's disease, neurofibromatosis, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, and the M4 type of adult acute leukemia.\n \n Leadership at NHGRI\n \n Tapped to take on the leadership of the HGP, Collins accepted an invitation in 1993 to become director of the National Center for Human Genome Research, which became NHGRI in 1997. As director, he oversees the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium and many other aspects of what he has called \"an adventure that beats going to the moon or splitting the atom.\"\n \n In 1994, Collins founded NHGRI's Division of Intramural Research (DIR), an intramural program of genome research that has developed into one of the nation's premier research centers in human genetics.\n \n Collins is particularly excited by the rapid progress being made in uncovering genetic risk factors for common diseases, such as heart disease, cancer and mental illness. The windfall of findings has been made possible by a relatively new research approach, called genome-wide association studies. This approach utilizes tools created by the HGP and the NHGRI-led International HapMap Project, which constructed a map of common human genetic variation.\n \n Collins's work in his highly active lab demonstrates his commitment to research involving both rare and common diseases. In April 2003, a team led by Collins identified the genetic basis of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, a rare disorder that causes a dramatic form of premature aging. Besides opening the door to possible treatment strategies for progeria, the discovery may provide insights into the process of normal human aging.\n \n As for common disorders, Collins and his colleagues published a landmark study in the journal Science on genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes. The findings boosted to at least 10 the number of genetic variants associated with increased susceptibility to the adult-onset form of diabetes, which affects nearly 21 million people in the United States and more than 200 million worldwide.\n \n In addition to his long list of contributions to basic genetic research and scientific leadership, Collins is known for his close attention to ethical and legal issues in genetics. He has been a strong advocate for protecting the privacy of genetic information and has served as a national leader in efforts to prohibit gene-based insurance discrimination. Building on his own experiences as a physician volunteer in a rural missionary hospital in Nigeria, Collins is also very interested in opening avenues for genome research to benefit the health of people living in developing nations.\n \n Collins' accomplishments have been recognized by numerous awards and honors, including election to the Institute of Medicine and the National Academy of Sciences.\n \n On Nov. 5, 2007, Collins received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civil award, for his revolutionary contributions to genetic research.\n http://www.genome.gov/10001018\n",

   "Ooh, an excuse to post here. Apologies, I've tl:dr'd the rest of the thread. I may also ramble.\n \n To expand on myself from here, my opinion is that homosexuality is partially genetic (hereditary), partially 'choice' (subconscious sociological pressure) and partly true choice (personal preference), due to the difficult nature of defining 'sexuality'.\n \n N.B. This is purely from personal experience of myself and people I know. Although I may end up muddling a few stats in as I go.\n \n Some people are undoubtedly 'straight'. The idea of same-sex sex is repulsive to them, even if they try to act in an opposite fashion and have no reason to think this. Some people, equally, are undoubtedly gay, for much the same reasons. But the majority of people (or at least a fair percentage, IMO) have the potential to label themselves 'straight' or 'gay' - essentially, most people are 'born' bisexual and react on sociological pressure to pick their sexuality - and some are in the position where if they tried, they could change their preferences. \n \n Sexuality is, therefore, a little hard to define. Is it 'what I am currently attracted to', 'what I could be attracted to', or 'what I've been attracted to so far'? Most people choose the 'currently attracted to' option, but this (as can be imagined) is fairly misleading when someone is doing a scientific study.\n \n Looking at Archie's blue text from above agrees with my position. Genetics (or other means of hereditary transfer) do prove influential in homosexuality, just as with several other personality traits. However, they are not the be all and end all: sociological pressure and personal opinion can also sway the outcome.\n \n Now, to ramble on to the main point. God. That homosexuality is even partly hereditary (or any 'behavioural trait' that is partially hereditary and can lead to sin) does imply that God is partly to blame, making it harder for some people to avoid sin than others right from birth. It's possible to blame even subconscious sociological pressure on the same free will that led to the Fall, but any hereditary features are not included in this. So, while you can't say 'God made me gay', you can certainly claim that He made it more likely to happen. \n \n As an aside, would you say 'God made me straight', Archie? Remember that homosexuality is just another type of sexuality, so if it applies here, it applies to you too.\n \n Come to that, why even give humans (and animals) the ability to be homosexual? Unlike the ability to murder, or lie, it does not have any practical use (if you look at it from an Archie's point of view), so why include it?\n \n Sorry, I'm rambling. I'll stop for now emoticon_smile",

   "Well, your article supports a lot of it. Sexuality is (only) partly hereditary - an individual is still 5-10 times more likely to be gay if their identical twin is, but this is not guaranteed. Once you have got rid of genetics, the two remaining influential factors are free will and sociological pressure (which is the emergent effect of everyone having free will, unless you are deterministic). To quote your text:\n \n However, the likelihood that the identical twin of a homosexual male will also be gay is about 20% (compared with 2-4 percent of males in the general population), indicating that sexual orientation is genetically influenced but not hardwired by DNA, and that whatever genes are involved represent predispositions, not predeterminations.\"\n \n Dr. Collins noted that environment, particularly childhood experiences as well as the role of free will choices affect all of us in profound ways.\n \n Thus, sexuality is influenced by all three factors. And the 'hereditary' part can only be blamed (if this is the correct term to use) on God - free will has no part in it, so God is all that is left.\n \n My own hypothesis explaining this is largely irrelevant, but it is that some people are genetically gay, some are genetically straight and a fairly large percentage are genetically bisexual (with leanings either way) and pick their sexuality based on sociological pressure and free will, with free will subdued in most cases under the subconscious influence of sociological pressure.\n I base this on the fact that some people, especially over the past few centuries, have been unchangeably gay, despite huge pressure from society and themselves not to be. Equally, therefore, there are probably those who are unchangeably straight: they are just harder to find because they are surrounded by a majority of 'straight' individuals. There are also very few open bisexuals, who have overcome sociological pressure to 'chose a gender' and have picked the option that lets them exercise their free will to the maximum extent. Finally, there are lots of people I know who are like myself: I am straight, I have always been straight and I probably always will be, but technically I am bisexual - I recognise the fact that I could (and have, very rarely) find some degree of sexual attractiveness in males. If I made the effort, I could probably train myself to think it more often, and change my sexuality - I know quite a few people like this, and I suspect that more exist than know it because sociological pressure has had a much stronger effect on them (I only recognised this a few years ago, purely due to that pressure).\n Technically Archie, if you believe that sexuality is a choice then everyone should be like this - a product of pressure and free will, with the ability to change. That brings us into interesting grounds about the 'against nature' argument, but let's not go there for a while\n \n But this is a ramble again. Feel free to ignore that final section.",

And the issue of atonement and the need for people to have forgiveness is very much a part of Christian religion. You may not agree, and that's your prerogative. No one is trying to force you to become religious. I disagree with your above statement--the issue of forgiveness very well might be raised as long as religion is discussed.\n\n \n Not in relation to heterosexuality. And let me stress, heterosexuality in and of itself, not other issues related to adultery.\n \n \nWithin certain parameters, it's considered fine, yes. But religion often focuses on things other than sexuality even in context of heterosexuality. In other words, it focuses off humanity and onto spiritual aspects. Take some clergy for instance. They don't get to be \"heterosexual\" at all. What they get to do is to serve God and put away earthly matters.\n\n \n That's highly specific, for a job. It's in a different context. I wouldn't have a problem from an equal treatment point of view, if both gays and straights were told to be celebate in this case.\n \n \nEven with non-priests--the laity--there is encouragement to focus on God and less on earthly issues.\n\n \n Straight kids in its charge are not being taught they can never during their lives, act on their sexuality, because it displeases God. Otherwise they'd be just as screwed up later on, as their gay peers who were taught this.\n \n \nThe point I'm trying to get across to you is that for my religion, the issue isn't so much gay versus God. It's things-that-distract-from-God versus God. For the Christian, Christ is to be supreme. The juxtaposition may, in fact, be a heterosexual relationship that needs to be avoided. Whether someone is gay or straight, or whatever, is really beside the point altogether.\n\n \n I'm not buying it. We're talking about a very general proscription in terms of homosexuality, but proscriptions only on very specific situations in relation to heterosexuality. So no, the fact that someone is gay or straight acting, is the point.\n \n \nFWIW, I think that's why what you call the 'ex-gay movement' exists in religion: because it can. Religion really offers the only alternative to such a focus on sexuality in one's life.\n\n \n And ANY focus on sexuality for ANY gay person is wrong, in your view, correct? That's such an ascetic ideal, to apply generally, it's like living in a fantasy land, where the streams run literally with milk and honey, and cannabis grows everywhere. \n \n The ex-gay movement exists as much if not more so, because of politics. Much of it's time and effort is spent criticizing the gay rights movement, and lying to its members. It tries to scare them into compliance, by talking about the supposed evils of the so-called, \"gay lifestyle\". Talk about distractions from the topic of God! It also has no clear definition of success. What a sham, or scam.\n \n \nWhat may come as a surprise for you is that there aren't many sermons in mainline Christian churches about homosexuals needing to be forgiven for acting on homosexuality. Again, the focus tends to be on atonement over being apart from God. I think you're trying to make an issue of trees when the real issue for Christianity (IMO) is the forest.\n\n \n And again, ANY homosexual acting in ANY way homosexually, is separation from God? But you wouldn't go that far with heterosexuals and their sexuality.",

   "Dr. Collins noted that environment, particularly childhood experiences as well as the role of free will choices affect all of us in profound ways.\n \n Thus, sexuality is influenced by all three factors. And the 'hereditary' part can only be blamed (if this is the correct term to use) on God - free will has no part in it, so God is all that is left.\n\n \n Did you notice that you contradict yourself between the sentence you quote and the sentence you wrote regarding free will? First you acknowledged that free will affects us all in profound ways, and then you deduce from that it is hereditary and that free will plays no part in it. How did you make that leap so quickly using the twins example? Collins also say's this:\n \n \"An area of particularly strong public interest is the genetic basis of homosexuality. Evidence from twin studies does in fact support the conclusion that heritable factors play a role in male homosexuality. However, the likelihood that the identical twin of a homosexual male will also be gay is about 20% (compared with 2-4 percent of males in the general population), indicating that sexual orientation is genetically influenced but not hardwired by DNA, and that whatever genes are involved represent predispositions, not predeterminations.\"\n \n And this:\n \n Dr. Collins noted that environment, particularly childhood experiences as well as the role of free will choices affect all of us in profound ways. As researchers discover increasing levels of molecular detail about inherited factors that underlie our personalities, it's critical that such data be used to illuminate, not provide support to idealogues.\n \n Since most all identical twins share experiences as well as environments, and also spend so much time in each others company. The fact that in only 20% of the cases will both be homosexual, tells us that it's reasonable that free will choice is possibly one of the largest contributing factors to one of them being homosexual.",

You show this any time anyone makes an attempt at real discourse with you. So no, until you change your ways, I'm not going to treat you as if you're a debater, because you simply aren't one. I've told you this before, but apparently it bears repeating.\n\n \n So you say. All anyone need do is go back in this very thread before it got derailed by posters who refused to respond with documented evidence, so they resorted to personally attacking the poster rather than responding to the evidence presented. That is the MO of those who can't support their positions around here and is the reason why I walk away from threads. Go ahead, look, the evidence speaks for itself.\n \n Here, follow the activity on page 2 regarding the fraudulent Hooker Study which led to homosexuality being removed from the medical journals as a formal disorder. You will clearly see that the opposition, you included, never offered any evidence at all that supported your opposition to my evidence that was documented in at least 4 different sources. Yet you all still focussed on anything but the evidence. This led to a further derailing of the thread as I became the focus of attack once again rather than anyone on your side responding to the substance of the evidence.\n \n Especially notice how your side, especially lyteboy, who is so adamant about how important and reliable scientific methodology is in other debate, completely ignores and glosses over the obvious perversion of that methodology regarding Hookers study. All of a sudden denial is preferable to honesty or accuracy when it comes to promoting the homosexual agenda.

Modern Slavery in China: Status of Chinese Worker\n \n Posted by chinaview on June 17, 2007\n \n Jonathan Watts in Beijing, The Guardian, UK, Saturday June 16, 2007 -\n \n Beijing (The Guardian)- More than 450 slave workers - many of them maimed, burned and mentally scarred - have been rescued from Chinese brick factories in an investigation into illegal labour camps, it emerged yesterday.\n \n The victims, including children as young as 14, were reportedly abducted or tricked into labouring at the kilns, where they toiled for 16 to 20 hours a day for no pay and barely enough food to live.\n \n According to the state media, they were beaten by guards and kept from escaping by dogs. At least 13 died from overwork and abuse, including a labourer who was allegedly battered to death with a shovel.\n \n Such cruelty appears to have been commonplace and, until this week, ignored by local governments intent on boosting economic growth at any cost.\n \n Their plight was revealed by one of the biggest known police operations in the country&#8217;s history.\n \n In the past week 35,000 police have inspected 7,500 kilns in the countryside of Shanxi and Henan provinces, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported. They have arrested 120 suspects and freed 468 slaves, including 109 juveniles.\n \n The results of this probe into the darkest corners of Chinese society have shocked the nation. Since the first case was revealed on June 8, newspapers and television broadcasts have been filled with images of the wounded, emaciated and traumatised slaves. Some were so badly hurt they had to be carried out on stretchers.\n \n Their living conditions were appalling. According to local media they were locked for years in a bare room with no bed or stove, allowed out only to work in the red-hot kilns, from where they would carry heavy, burning loads of newly fired bricks on their bare backs. Many were badly scalded. Fifteen-minute meal-breaks consisted only of steamed buns and cold water.\n \n One of the labourers, 17-year-old Zang Wenlong, told a TV station that the kiln where he worked for three months in Caosheng village in Shanxi was a &#8220;prison&#8221;. He said he had been abducted from a train station.\n \n The huge police investigation was prompted by 400 parents of missing youths, who posted a petition on the internet last week, accusing local officials of ignoring their suspicions.\n \n Yang Aizhi told Xinhua that she went looking for her 16-year-old son in March after hearing that he might have been forced to work at a brick factory.\n \n In visits to dozens of kilns in Shanxi - a province famous for its coal and heavy industry - she found children still in school uniform who were pressed into hard labour.\n \n President Hu Jintao and prime minister Wen Jiabao ordered an investigation, compensation for victims and severe punishment for traffickers and jailers. The leaders rose to power on a promise to improve the conditions of those left behind by the country&#8217;s breakneck development.\n \n But many commentators believe high-profile investigations only scratch the surface of child labour, trafficking and slavery. With no free media, independent courts or rival political parties, it is easy for local officials to conspire with factory owners to ignore labour laws. &#8220;If China really gave the media freedom, you would see stories like this appearing all the time,&#8221; said Qiao Mu, of Beijing Foreign Study University.\n \n Internet chatrooms were buzzing with criticism of the local authorities. &#8220;My feeling is that local officials and police benefit from the brick industry and that&#8217;s why these appalling things could happen,&#8221; said one post. &#8220;The boss and local gangsters are not the only criminals. The courts should also sentence local officials who were bribed off,&#8221; said another.\n \n - original report from The Guardian: Enslaved, burned and beaten: police free 450 from Chinese brick factories\n And since you'll most likely attack either the source or the age of this source, here's an excerpt of another more recent story.Arbitrary Imprisonment and Slavery\n \n \n 17 May 2008\n \n In today&#8217;s China, any Chinese person can be picked off the street, say, on the way to the supermarket, and be immediately turned into a slave for up to three years without legal procedure. This has happened to hundreds of thousands of people who practice Falun Gong and vanished into China&#8217;s vast system of labor camps.\n \n There are between 200,000 and 2 million Falun Gong adherents held in China&#8217;s vast system of detention centers and labor &#8220;re-education&#8221; camps. Outdoors in Siberia-like weather of northeastern China winters or in the suffocating heat of unventilated rooms filled with fumes of glue and feces, detainees work up to 20 hours of labor a day. Those who refuse are beaten, tortured, or starved.\n \n Many of the products they make &#8211; Christmas tree lights, toys, chopsticks - are sold to us in America, Europe, and Australia. \n \n Making toys amidst torture in a Beijing labor camp\n \n Especially since late 2007, consumers of low-priced &#8220;Made in China&#8221; products now recognize the long-term costs of such goods - dangerous lead toys, Chinese food product scares, related rising unemployment rates at home and trade deficits have all made headlines. \n \n But perhaps the most severe price of all is often ignored - modern slavery is alive and well in China. http://www.faluninfo.net/topic/15/",

All the Lord requires of us is that we try our BEST not to sin anymore. He is a loving Father who loves homosexuals also. He will forgive all our sins, if we work with Him and repent! (repent means to \"turn away from\")\n \n About God's Character:\n Exodus 34:6-7 \"...The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth generation..\"\n The Greek word apostasia is used here for the \"falling away.\" It is from this word that we derive the English word \"apostasy.\" Apostasy is defined as \"a defection from the truth,\" or \"a departing from that which was given at first.\" \n \n Along with ordaining Priestesses, the present Apostasy of homosexual clergy is a sure sign of the End Times Church\n \n Timothy 4:1-2, \"Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron.\" \n \n 2 Timothy 4:3-4 Paul says, \"For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.\"\n \n By calling homosexuality an \"abomination\", the true God of the Bible has already made known His feelings about this grave sin.\n \"For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace\" (1 Corinthians 14:33).\n \n God has declared a simple rule to test the pronouncements of men who say they are speaking for Him. Through the prophet Isaiah, He said, \"To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them\" (Isaiah 8:20, KJV)\n \n Quite simply, this means that there is only one authoritative source of information on matters relating to God and salvation.

   "Is that actually a poll of their views, or is it their view about others in Christianity? :) When letting those who dislike Christianity define it, then naturally it's going to come out defined the way it's opposers want it to.\n\n Actually, both Christian and non-Christian were examined.\n Furthermore, to talk about \"those who dislike Christianity\" is a pointless way to sidestep the issue. It appears you dismiss their opinion because you want to sum them up as \"those who dislike Christianity\".\n \n Even if we adopted your perspective, a real response would be to question WHY these people \"dislike Christianity\" in the first place...\n Among young non-Christians, nine out of the top 12 perceptions were negative. Common negative perceptions include that present-day Christianity is judgmental (87%), hypocritical (85%), old-fashioned (78%), and too involved in politics (75%) - representing large proportions of young outsiders who attach these negative labels to Christians. The most common favorable perceptions were that Christianity teaches the same basic ideas as other religions (82%), has good values and principles (76%), is friendly (71%), and is a faith they respect (55%). \n \n Even among young Christians, many of the negative images generated significant traction. Half of young churchgoers said they perceive Christianity to be judgmental, hypocritical, and too political. One-third said it was old-fashioned and out of touch with reality. \n Furthermore, the poll also demonstrates that the percentage of youth IN Christianity is slipping...\n One reason that Christianity's image is changing is due to the shifting faith allegiances of Americans. Simply put, each new generation has a larger share of people who are not Christians (that is, atheists, agnostics, people associated with another faith, or those who have essentially no faith orientation). The new book refers to this group as \"outsiders\" because they are describing what Christianity looks like from an outsider's perspective. Among adults over the age of 40, only about one-quarter qualify as outsiders, while among the 16 to 29 segment, two-fifths are outsiders. This represents a significant migration away from the dominant role that Christianity has had in America. \n \n As pointed out in the Barna Update related to atheists and agnostics, this is not a passing fad wherein young people will become \"more Christian\" as they grow up. While Christianity remains the typical experience and most common faith in America, a fundamental recalibration is occurring within the spiritual allegiance of America's upcoming generations. \n \n Yet, the research shows that millions of young outsiders have significant experience with Christians and Christian churches. The typical young outsider says they have five friends who are Christians; more than four out of five have attended a Christian church for a period of at least six months in the past; and half have previously considered becoming a Christian.http://www.barna.org/FlexPage.aspx?Page=BarnaUpdateNarrow&BarnaUpdateID=280\n \n This isn't just a matter of \"some people hate Christianity and want to slur it\".\n These people have SEEN Christianity, and decided of their own volition that it has some sides to it that just plain aren't pretty.\n \n \n \nNo one's trying to make you become a Christian, Lesz.\n\n Matthew 28:19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost\n \n But in modern day Christianity, the push to convert to Christianity is relaxed.\n Actually, there is more of a push for gays to convert to heterosexuality than there is for non-Christians to change to Christians.\n I suspect that's one reason for the observation of \"hypocrisy\", or at least IMO...\n \n \n \nLike it or not, that one issue just isn't the only one in society, nor really even the most important one (though it may be the most important of all in your thinking). Christian groups have to be viewed in light of all their beliefs, not just in light of one belief--a relatively minor one at that.\n\n Surely you can't be trying to pretend that homosexuality is viewed as a \"relatively minor\" sin.\n Christian anti-gay groups pump MILLIONS into their organizations in order to expressly condemn gays. Examples of how much emphasis a large number of Christians put on homosexuality can be seen in a variety of ways.\n Why not just look at the vast accumulation of threads on this \"gay\" section for proof of that?\n \n But can we say the same for other \"sins\"?\n Like bearing false witness?\n Or taking the Christian God's name in vain?\n Or not respecting father/mother?\n Or people to not covet their neighbor's goods?\n \n \n \nIf a group is doing a great deal to help the poor, conducting aid and humanitarian work all over the world, yet happens to have the view that gay sex is not ok, I'm afraid you're just going to have to be out of luck.\n\n There is an AWFUL LOT of time, money, and energy spent by Christians on the gay issue that goes well above and beyond the \"gay sex is not ok\".\n \n If Christians ONLY \"happened to have the view that gay sex is not ok\", I wouldn't care. You're entitled to your opinion, like I am to mine.\n It's all the other crud that Christians do above and beyond which is the problem, so quit trying to minimalize the Christian involvement.\n \n \n \nI'll go with those who are helping others the most, thank you, despite that one minor belief. I'm certainly not going to abandon all that just because of your hangup over that one issue on their part.\n\n Going back to the Barna poll above, is that REALLY how those who are not entrenched in \"Christianity\" view the religion?\n Or really how most people who ARE \"Christian\" view the religion?\n \n Obviously, most young non-Christians DO NOT share your summation of modern Christianity.\n Even among most young CHRISTIANS, half see Christianity as \"judgmental, hypocritical, and too political\".\n \n You can ignore this if you like, and your future generation numbers will continue to decline. Dig your head in the sand if you will.\n Or you can work to change the perception, and MAKE Christianity more in line with how you are trying to describe it.\n \n Christianity is being judged by its fruits, and it's not just by me...",

   "Be reasonable Jake. I wasn't suggesting that a toddler would be walking down the street unescorted. My example is about a child who is old enough to be walking down the street in his neighborhood when said stranger approaches him. Like an 8 to 10 year old who should know better and has been taught by his parents the right thing to do. At some point you must endorse personal responsibility rather than always insisting that \"it's someone else's fault.\" Be it God or parents, if we are warned sufficiently to avoid certain pitfalls, and then we allow ourselves to be deceived and manipulated, we must then take responsibility for that.\n \n \n It doesn't really matter that much. 8 or 10 year olds will have some limited understanding of good and evil and right and wrong, and are able to judge in some limited capacity, based on that. That's how they are able to avoid the evil. However, still, good parents are protective. They wouldn't allow a situation where an evil stranger has access to their kid, if they in any way had power to prevent it. You can't hold the child responsible, you'd hold the adult who should certainly know better, responsible. Adam and Eve were like a toddler or newborn baby, in that they had NO knowledge of right/wrong, good/evil.",

   "Even if we adopted your perspective, a real response would be to question WHY these people \"dislike Christianity\" in the first place...\n\n \n Of course it would all be the fault of the Christians in your view, and have nothing to do with the unreasonableness of those who dislike it, huh?\n \n \nEven among young Christians, many of the negative images generated significant traction. Half of young churchgoers said they perceive Christianity to be judgmental, hypocritical, and too political. One-third said it was old-fashioned and out of touch with reality. [/indent]\n\n \n And yet they ARE 'churchgoers.' This just demonstrates a willingness for self-examination. It may be what you want to hear (given your trumpeting the study) but no one ever said Christians were perfect.bbLook, Christians aren't some unified body that all get together and meet about how they're going to try to make the lives of gay people miserable. They're just religious, and being polled in these areas doesn't really have anything to do with the central tenets. It's like polling a sports team about political issues; you're going to have some different than others. \n \n As far as your assertion that Christianity is in some 'decline', I always get a chuckle out of claims like that. Christianity (just as many religions) has been an ebb-and-flow at numerous times; it's cyclical. U.S. Christianity \"declined\" in the 18th century and increased in the 19th. It was far smaller in the first 2 or 3 centuries than it is now--so what? And it's certainly not in decline in Latin American countries and Africa, so obviously there are other dynamics--it's nothing as simple as you seem to think. Your claims are like those in the 1970s who said warm weather is in decline since we had some particularly cold years.\n \n But more importantly, the health of the religion isn't tied to how widespread it is. Even if it were to grow very tiny (not going to happen in the anywhere-near-future), it would still thrive in terms of not being able to stamp it out. We know this because of the early centuries of the religion. Rest easy; Christianity is here to stay. :) \n \n \nMatthew 28:19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost\n But in modern day Christianity, the push to convert to Christianity is relaxed.\n\n \n Well, which is it? On one hand you don't really want people to prostlytize you, on the other you chastise them if they don't. It seems Christians just can't win, in your view.\n \n \nActually, there is more of a push for gays to convert to heterosexuality than there is for non-Christians to change to Christians.\n I suspect that's one reason for the observation of \"hypocrisy\", or at least IMO...\n\n \n Riiiiight ... and I'm sure you'll now show us stats that demonstrate how, in all of Christianity, more efforts and resources are being put into converting gays to straights than non-Christians to Christians. emoticon_rolleyes Or let me guess--the ex-gay movement? Do you have ANY idea how small that is as compared to Christianity overall, or even 'Christian conversion-minded' mission efforts??? \n \n \nWhy not just look at the vast accumulation of threads on this \"gay\" section for proof of that?\n \n But can we say the same for other \"sins\"?\n Like bearing false witness?\n Or taking the Christian God's name in vain?\n Or not respecting father/mother?\n Or people to not covet their neighbor's goods?\n\n \n There AREN'T forums here for these other sins, Foundit. There IS a forum for gay-related issues. What the heck do you expect??? emoticon_xdonno \n \n Christians support all kinds of groups for all kinds of reasons. Let me guess--you're one of those people that don't even acknowledge that James Dobson has written way more about divorce than he ever has about homosexuality, aren't you? :) The reason you don't see other sins talked about is because you aren't looking, Foundit. You 'hear' about the gay-issue more because that's what you NOTICE. Because it's something that applies to you. And because it makes the news a lot more when a preacher says something about THAT than it does when he says something about divorce or something from your list above. \n \n But don't just take my word for it. Tell you what ... let me give you a challenge. Go into a Christian bookstore sometime and count how many books there are on the shelves about sin as pertains to homosexuality and how many there are on issues pertaining to divorce. Or as related to parent/child relationships (your 4th example) just so you can't say \"but I didn't say anything ABOUT divorce--as if that's not the most oft-used example against those who claim to be pro-family anyway.) If you count even half as many, I'll concede to you. emoticon_xgood",

There are several reasons for this, including the value of demonising gay people as means of rasing money from the faithful. The onset of gay marriage is another.

Since you clearly don't like the distinction I'm going by, then what distinction do you think SHOULD be made?

If that's my \"personal\" distinction, then it's a distinction that's a part of REALITY. Do I really need to show you some of the fundie sites out there such as Westboro Bap. Church? \nFundamentalist Christianity, also known as Christian Fundamentalism or Fundamentalist Evangelicalism, is an movement that arose mainly within British and American Protestantism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries among conservative evangelical Christians, who, in a reaction to modernism, actively affirmed a fundamental set of Christian beliefs: the inerrancy of the Bible, Sola Scriptura, the virgin birth of Christ, the doctrine of substitutionary atonement, the bodily resurrection of Jesus, and the imminent personal return of Jesus Christ. Some who hold these beliefs reject the label of \"fundamentalism,\" seeing it as a pejorative term for historic Christian doctrine[1] while to others it has become a banner of pride.[2]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamentalist_Christianity\n \n The real issue for \"anti-gay groups\" is espousing their beliefs into legislation and action that discriminate against gays.\n I see nothing in the real definition of \"fundamentalism\" which establishes that.\n \n I think \"anti-gay Christians\" is much more concise, as it describes the Christians who actually are anti-gay without blurring boundaries.\n \n \n \nHardly. It's the biggest obstruction to gay rights there is. Certainly more accurate to say so that to NOT make any distinction, as if all of Christianity is the cause.\n\n The poll talks about general perceptions of \"Christianity\".\n That's not the same thing as \"all\" of Christianity.\n \n \n \nSo, assume everyone is guilty, rather than you proving the whole religion is doing it?\n\n I think I've already established that not \"every\" Christian is part of an anti-gay group.\n In fact, I believe that on a lot of gay equality issues, there would be a majority of Christians supporting gay rights.\n \n \n \nTrying to do so is one of the things we see so much FROM fundies.

I can't imagine why you're suddenly wanting to act as though fundies aren't the ones doing that and act as though the whole religion IS.\n\n I just don't use the word \"fundamentalist Christian\" to mean what you are distinguishing.\n Furthermore, just like the phrase \"anti-gay group\" does not imply that all groups are anti-gay, saying \"anti-gay Christian\" does not imply all Christians are anti-gay.\n But what it DOES do is distinguish specifically the \"anti-gay\" Christian from those Christians who are not \"anti-gay\".\n \n \n \n(Incidentally, it hasn't gone unnoticed how some here are suddenly SO seemingly concerned about the health of this religion. ;) Why, you'd think they had been downright supportive of it all this time ...  )\n\n I wouldn't confuse noting trends in the religion as \"concern\"...\n Christianity will eventually evolve and adapt.\n The bible is filled with bible passages establishing women as a lower status than men. But Christianity, in most of its varied forms, typically ignore those passages and have no problem with women teachers or women in authority positions.\n Despite the Bible's explicit condemnation.\n \n There's also the modern adaptation for divorce.
