   "I am currently doing a geochem report which involves estimating the annual tonnages of copper discharged into a river. The concentraion of the copper is 45 ppm. The discharge rate is roughly 10 litres a second. If I multiply the discharge (10) by 60*60*24 I get the flow rate in litres per day. Multiply this by .000045 to get the conc of copper flow per day. my answer was 38 litres per day. (is my procedure correct here?)\n \n Now how the hell do I get the ton equivalent of this? The actual weight of Cu into the river?",
