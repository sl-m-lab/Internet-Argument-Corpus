   "The matter of vexations put upon Chechen refugees by European authorities has been widely puffed up of late on various web sites supporting Chechen separatist like KavkazCenter. If I say it is hysteria false to the core and obscene provocation I will leave half the truth. However that was not it. From now on Chechen separatists started to beat to arms to \"face-off outrages\" by authorities (of Poland in the first place but not only). \n \n What is worth taking note of, they post these calls on Russian forums of the sites. I think they put it like this - if anything goes wrong after all, Chechens were not to be responsible for that as the calls for violence were made by some unknown visitors of the forums. Besides, there is not so many English-speaking people who visit forums in Russian not knowing it. Bearing this in mind, I want to present you some loose translation of one among many calls to \"jihad\" \n \n \nSHIRVANI BATALOV.\n \n Brothers and sisters! All the Muslem! We are surrounded by falsehood and hatred! <...< Poland gave us home as we were in bad need for it. They saved us from genocide. But who could know that it was a trap? We hugged people of Poland as if they were our brothers but they betrayed us! They have rung us like cattle into cages of concentration camps. They tried to break our spirit and dignity. But the Chechens are free people and we shall not endure everyday derision and abasements! Jihad is our path! To begin with, it will be Palestinian style of Molotov cocktails and cobblestones. But this is only the beginning. We shall keep on fighting with firing arms and blasting units. Armed struggle shall be our path! Wherever we are, we must let the infidels see what genuine faith in Allah is and what means to be a true believer!\n \n Allah Akbar!\n\n \n It is also worthy of note that the mentioned KavkazCenter is physically located in Sweden, a European state that gave home to many anti-Europe extremists",
