If N is odd, the probability of the die being even is (N-1)/(2N)= 1/2 - 1/(2N) which is 1/2 as N approaches infinity. If N is even, the probability of the die being even is N/(2N)=1/2, which is also 1/2 as N approaches infinity. Since both limits approach 1/2, the limit is 1/2.\n \n However, N is not (countably) infinite (by definition). If the die truly had a countably infinite number of sides, nothing could be said definitively about the probability of it being even. That said, I'm not really sure as a matter of practicality why anybody would be concerned about a die with a countably infinite number of sides (versus a die with a very large, yet still finite, number of sides, N).",

How does the math work? Essentialy, this seems to me to be about whether, given what we know about set theory and infinity, it is possible to coherently discuss \"half of infinity.\" Comments, please.\n\n \n I can answer the specific question by dodging the larger one.\n \n Any number must end in one of ten digits, 2,4,6,8,0 or 1,3,5,7,9. Of these ten, if it ends with one of the first five it's even, and if the last five it's odd. There's an equal chance that the final digit could be in either group, since the groups are the same size, so the odds of a random number being even is 50%.\n \n So that's the easy part. Now for your larger question, is there such a thing as half of infinity. I'd have to say no, not in the way that you probably mean. When we talk about splitting something in half, we generally conceive of that as meaning spliltting something into two parts of equal size. However, size isn't really relevant when talking about infinite sets. Instead we talk about the order of the infinite set. For example, the evens and the odds are of the same order. However, they are also of the same order as the whole numbers. So while intuition tells us that the set of even numbers must be \"half the size\" as the set of whole numbers, they are in fact of the same order, which is roughly analogous to saying that they are infinite sets of the \"same size\". There are infinite sets that are of a larger order than others. The irrationals are of a larger order than the rationals, for example. However, you can't supply an integer value to how much larger. You can't say that one is twice as large as the other.",
