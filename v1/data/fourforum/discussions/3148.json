Even someone who has been sexaully molested can be celibant later in life. What has been suggested (that created this debate) is that homosexual persons should remian celibant because they are homosexual. This started on another thread and was moved here. Justine gave it a new twist by a adding the part of marriage and sex outside of marriage. She is asking if it would be different or would it change the view if gays were married and having sex? What is disturbing is that anyone would think that because they are gay they should be celibant. Of course those that think they are regiliously motivated. And not everyone is religious or thinks that homosexuality is wrong.\n \n This leaves Justine's original question again:\n \n If sex outside of marriage is \"wrong\" than should gays remain celibant until they can marry? Or shluld gays be celibant because they are gay? or my take on this: Is it unhealthy to expect gays to be celibant which there is some scientific evidence to support that it is unhealthy.\n \n Note for Ladywolf: Children being molested is not an act of sex, it is an act of power.
