   "In Time magazine front cover of President Clinton greeting Monica Lewinsky in line there is a man with his hand out who looked just like Daniel Ayalon. http://img.timeinc.net/time/magazine/archive/covers/1998/1101980810_400.jpg In the news film footage of President Clinton and Monica's greeting the image of Daniel Ayalon was much clearer.

Only by reviewing the original video news footage can this be confirmed.",
