   "GEORGE W. BUSH:\n We don't really care why the chicken crossed the road. We just want to know if the chicken is on our side of the road or not. The chicken is either with us or it is against us. There is no middle ground here.\n \n AL GORE:\n I invented the chicken. I invented the road. Therefore, the chicken crossing the road represented the application of these two different functions of government in a new, reinvented way designed to bring greater services to the American people.\n \n RALPH NADER:\n The chicken's habitat on the original side of the road had been polluted by unchecked industrialist greed. The chicken did not reach the unspoiled habitat on the other side of the road because it was crushed by the wheels of a gas-guzzling SUV.\n \n PAT BUCHANAN:\n To steal a job from a decent, hard-working American.\n \n RUSH LIMBAUGH:\n I don't know why the chicken crossed the road, but I'll bet it was getting a government grant to cross the road, and I'll bet someone out there is already forming a support group to help chickens with crossing-the-road syndrome. Can you believe this? How much more of this can real Americans take? Chickens crossing the road paid for by their tax dollars, and when I say tax dollars, I'm talking about your money, money the government took from you to build roads for chickens to cross.\n \n DR. SEUSS:\n Did the chicken cross the road? Did he cross it with a toad? Yes, the chicken crossed the road, but why it crossed, I've not been told!\n \n ERNEST HEMINGWAY:\n To die. In the rain. Alone.\n \n MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.:\n I envision a world where all chickens will be free to cross roads without having their motives called into question.\n \n GRANDPA:\n In my day, we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road. Someone told us that the chicken crossed the road, and that was good enough for us.\n \n BARBARA WALTERS:\n Isn't that interesting? In a few moments we will be listening to the chicken tell, for the first time, the heart-warming story of how it experienced a serious case of molting and went on to accomplish its life-long dream of crossing the road.\n \n JOHN LENNON:\n Imagine all the chickens crossing roads in peace.\n \n ARISTOTLE:\n It is the nature of chickens to cross the road.\n \n KARL MARX:\n It was a historical inevitability.\n \n SADDAM HUSSEIN:\n This was an unprovoked act of rebellion and we were quite justified in dropping 50 tons of nerve gas on it.\n \n VOLTAIRE:\n I may not agree with what the chicken did, but I will defend to the death its right to do it.\n \n RONALD REAGAN:\n What chicken?\n \n CAPTAIN KIRK:\n To boldly go where no chicken has gone before.\n \n FOX MULDER:\n You saw it cross the road with your own eyes! How many more chickens have to cross before you believe it?\n \n BILL GATES:\n I have just released eChicken 2003, which will not only cross roads, but also will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance your check book - and Internet Explorer is an inextricable part of eChicken.\n \n MARTHA STEWART:\n No one called to warn me which way that chicken was going. I had a standing order at the farmer's market to sell my eggs when the price dropped to a certain level. No little bird gave me any insider information.\n \n ALBERT EINSTEIN:\n Did the chicken really cross the road or did the road move beneath the chicken?\n \n BILL CLINTON:\n I did not cross the road with THAT chicken. What do you mean by chicken? Could you define chicken, please?\n \n COLONEL SANDERS:\n I missed one?",

   "zachvac, if you don't mind, I'd like to flow with one you gave.\n \nCAPTAIN KIRK:\n To boldly go where no chicken has gone before.\n\n Spock:\n Chickens are highly illogical beings. To question a chicken's actions is also illogical.\n \n Dr. McCoy:\n Dammit Jim, I'm a doctor, not a griller!\n \n Chekhov:\n The chicken was heading to Russia.\n \n Sulu:\n The Klingons were firing at it, captain.\n \n Scotty:\n I was giving her all I got! The chicken couldn't a-take any more.\n \n Uhera:\n The Chicken is hailing captain. (Chicken shown, close up to Kirk looking dramatic, heavy theme music, go to commercial.)\n \n Picard:\n Clearly we are dealing with one unusual chicken, number 1.\n \n Troy:\n I sense anxiety from the chicken.\n \n Data:\n I have never seen a chicken before who seemed so intense on crossing the road. Perhaps it was heading for the other side. Or perhaps it didn't start in the road but from where we see it, it was getting out of the road. Or perhaps the chicken felt berated by the other chickens. I do not know for sure. Perhaps it would help if I looked into Starfleet records. With your permission captain, I shall check the records on Chicken psychology for a more accurate answer.\n \n Ricker:\n Should I prepare an away team to assist the chicken, sir?\n \n Wesley Crusher:\n Maybe I could give the chicken some words of advise allowing him to feel all warm and gooey inside and complete his journey allowing for one big happy ending.\n \n Worf:\n The Chicken has no honor.\n \n Dr. Crusher:\n Captain, we should prepare a hypo-spray for the chicken and the crew. It could be running away but as a carrier for some chicken disease.\n \n Geordi:\n Maybe we could stabilized the warp field, allowing us to warp the chicken along on it's way faster. It would only take about 2 hours to do.",
