Gibbs mumbled and stumbled his way through a press conference trying to answer reporters questions.\n\n \n Gibbs is a travesty anyway, just like the rest of them. Did anyone ask him about that 'earthquake in Hawaii', I bet he would have REALLY mumbled and stumbled there.\n \n Can you imagine the clamor of the MSM if a Republican president had said that?\n \n \nObama is obviously fighting for his political future hoping his presence will help push his healthcare bill through congress. Makes one wonder if Pelosi's arm twisting didn't produce enough \"yes\" votes.\n\n \n NO, he is expecting it to pass and wants to sign it before it comes off the floor...they would otherwise put it on an F14 and jet it to wherever he was.\n \n FLASH! Just talked to Lynn Westmorlands office a few minutes ago and at this point the Democrats are 5 votes short, which is why they will 'slaughter' the Constitution.\n \n \nOf course if all fails they will simply fall back on the \"deem to pass\" trick.\n\n \n Freaking socialists...",
