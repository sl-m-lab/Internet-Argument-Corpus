   "From Americans United:\n \n http://www.au.org/site/News2\n \n RELIGIOUS RIGHT GROUP'S ATTACK ON HINDU PRAYER IN CONGRESS 'REEKS OF RELIGIOUS BIGOTRY,' SAYS AU\n Thursday, September 21, 2000\n FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL SAYS ONLY CHRISTIANITY DESERVES GOVERNMENT SUPPORT\n The Family Research Council's scurrilous attack on a Hindu priest's prayer in the U.S. House of Representatives \"reeks of religious bigotry,\" said Americans United for Separation of Church and State, a watchdog group that monitors the Religious Right.\n \n Venkatachalapathi Samuldrala, a Hindu priest with the Shiva Vishnu Temple in Parma, Ohio, made history on Sept. 14 by becoming the first Hindu religious leader to offer an invocation before a session of Congress.\n \n In response to the prayer, the Family Research Council, the most prominent Religious Right lobbying group in Washington, D.C., disparaged religious pluralism and said only Christianity deserves government support in this week's edition of the group's CultureFacts newsletter.\n \n \"(W)hile it is true that the United States of America was founded on the sacred principle of religious freedom for all,\" the FRC wrote, \"that liberty was never intended to exalt other religions to the level that Christianity holds in our country's heritage.\"\n \n The group added, \"Our Founders expected that Christianity -- and no other religion -- would receive support from the government as long as that support did not violate peoples' consciences and their right to worship. They would have found utterly incredible the idea that all religions, including paganism, be treated with equal deference.\"\n \n The Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United, said an attack such as this is telling about the Religious Right's regard for non-Christian religious minorities.\n \n \"The FRC's attack reeks of religious bigotry,\" Lynn said. \"Despite years of claiming support for religious liberty, the truth has come out. This is an outrageous act of prejudice and it should be condemned by decent people everywhere.\"\n \n The FRC, a spin-off of James Dobson's Focus on the Family, went on to describe \"religious pluralism\" as leading to \"moral relativism and ethical chaos,\" while approving of tolerance that \"embraces biblical truth while allowing freedom of conscience.\"\n \n \"As for our Hindu priest friend, the United States is a nation that has historically honored the One True God,\" the FRC's newsletter concluded. \"Woe be to us on that day when we relegate Him to being merely one among countless other deities in the pantheon of theologies.\"\n \n Responded AU's Lynn, \"Sounds like our 'friends' at the FRC need to go back to a high school history class. And while they're at it, maybe they should stop by a kindergarten class to learn something about respect for people's differences.\n \n \"It is truly rare, even within the Religious Right, to see a group display simultaneously such a poor understanding of history and a remarkable lack of respect for religious diversity,\" Lynn continued. \"Usually, profound ignorance like this is commonly found in the 18th, not the 21st, century.\n \n \"Contrary to the FRC's views, there are no second-class religions in America,\" Lynn added. \"Hindus, Muslims, Jews and other non-Christian faiths are equal in the eyes of the law.\" . . .",

Religious tolerance protects all religions, even Christianity. The ignorance of this fact is shocking. When you combine this ignorance with religious fervor and certitude, you have a set-up for dangerous behavior. That is the danger of religious bigotry.

If you're going to say that, then you should be going the full way and take the stand that there shouldn't have been a religious prayer in a U.S. govt. meeting to begin with. It seems to me that the Christians who protested were no more violating any basic tenets than the very fact there was religious prayer going on in a govt. congressional meeting in the first place. \n \n \nWhen you combine this ignorance with religious fervor and certitude, you have a set-up for dangerous behavior. That is the danger of religious bigotry. \n\n \n While I find the behavior repugnant, I think you'd be pretty hard-pressed to show Hinduism as a religion as being in any danger as a result of this action. Frankly, it's pretty hard for me to take major indignation over this seriously due to the same sort of #### I've seen Christians deal with from it's critics and haters down through the years.",
