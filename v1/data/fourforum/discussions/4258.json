We cannot prove that God is not ultimately behind evolution. Even as an atheist and a firm believer in evolution, I am fully prepared to admit that. It's simple logic.\n \n I'm aware that isn't a biblical quote, but nonetheless, I think it gets my point across.\n \n \nGenesis 2: 19 So out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the air, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them; and whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name. 20 The man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for the man there was not found a helper fit for him.\n\n \n Beasts of the field? Birds of the air? Man named them as he saw fit?\n \n I asked for a quote that says animals were created EXACTLY as they are today, that quote in no way supplies evidence for your assertion to that extent.\n \n \nthis all occured on the 6th day of creation. it shows that cattle, birds and \"beasts of the field\" existed at the time of creation. we have nothing resembling cattle in the fossil record\n\n \n What do you mean by \"existed at the time of creation\"? You mean in the first 5 days? Before humans were created? Or before creation all together?\n \n To the best of my knowledge, we do have cattle, or at least the prehistoric ancestors of cattle in the fossil record.\n \n \nGenesis 4: 2 And again, she bore his brother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, and Cain a tiller of the ground.\n \n one generation after life was first created, we see that sheep also existed. unless they evolved from generic \"cattle\" super-fast, we can assume that they were created that way from the onset. we have nothing that resembles sheep in fossil record\n\n \n Again, I'm quite sure we do have ancestral and transitional forms of sheep in the fossil record. I'll look for a link if you'd like.\n \n Where in the Bible does it say that sheep didn't exist prior to Abel?\n \n Who's to say that what Abel called a sheep, you and I would call a sheep? \n \n What if it was closer in nature to a modern mountain goat or muskox?\n \n \nthe genesis account implies that domesticated animals and livestock were created the way they are, as well as all the other animals created at the time\n\n \n That's exactly my point unkerpaulie, it IMPLIES, it does not state as fact or specify. Therefore your assertion is based on implications and assumptions, and ipso facto can NOT be presented as fact.\n \n \naccepting creation/evolution is always a matter of personal belief. i am not trying to demonstrate that either evolution or creation is true (based on fact) but that both are mutually exclusive (based on logic). \n \n \n An impossible task IMHO.\n \n \nas far as interpretation of the bible is concerned, the most essential purpose of genesis in the context of the bible is to establish that 1) God is all-powerful and 2) man is fallen and needs to be redeemed. regardless of what \"interpretation\" is being offered, if these 2 precepts cant be deduced, then the interpretation does not support christianity, which is the only purpose of the bible. i have not seen, found, or been presented with, any \"interpretation\" that fullfills this needs except the literal interpretation. if you know of any, i'd be more than happy to look at it\n\n \n I'm way out of my league here, but it would seem to me that Genesis does not need to be read literally for these two precepts to be established. \n \n Further to that, does man literally need to fall, or can the fall be strictly figurative? Does Christianity truly need to be based on an actual physical literal event in order to be valid, or can it be based on a figurative event? For my money, the latter is more than sufficient, we're dealing with something that is not tangibly physical in the first place, we're dealing with the spiritual.\n \n Waxy",

It does say that God created in specific kinds of animals, e.g. dog kind, and that they were to reproduce after their own seed (already destroying any compromising views with evolution). These kinds would have been created with massive amounts of information (specified complexity) and hence had a large capicity for variation within their kind. Once again, look at the dog kind. We have a variety of dogs today with varying fur sizes, colour, height, etc, etc, but they are all still dogs that most likely came from two dogs in the beginning and have varied over time (the 6,000 years since creation) as the information has thinned out in their kind. For example, God wouldn't have made a poodle or a dingo. These two types of dog have just varied within their kind as they have recieved certain genes that give them their individual characteristics. \n \n It is also important to note that many species and kinds (such as the dinosaur kinds) have become extinct - some possibly due to climate change (e.g. during the ice age that followed the global flood) or human's hunting them for food, clothes, sport, etc.",

   "I strongly agree with unkerpaulie that (Christian) creation and evolution cannot be inclusive. Allow me to outline a few problems for Christians who believe in evolution:\n \n 1. Creation is finished:\n \n The Bible teaches clearly that God finished His work of creating and making things on the sixth day of creation. \"Thus the heavens and teh Earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it He had rested from all His work which God created and made\" (Genesis 2:13). God's work of creation finished at the end of teh sixth day, when God completed all He had set out to do. However, because of man's fall, God now works at reconciliation. \n \n Those who believe that God used evolution must believe that the same processes God used in this supposed \"creation\" are going on today. When the evolutionists looks at the world today, he observes mutations (mistakes or changes in genes) and natural selection (survival of the fittest) and sees these as part of the mechanisms of evolution. Given enough time, natural selection and mutations are said to enable organisms to change from one kind into another. What the evolutionist is doing, then, is using processes he observes today to extrapolate into the past. He believes these processes over millions of years are the basic mechanisms of evolution.\n \n Christians who say God used evolution to bring everything including man into being, have a real problem. If evolution is not occurring today (i.e. if God is not \"creating\" through evolution), there is no basis to extrapolate into the past to say that evolution has ever occurred, as there is now no mechanism for it. In other words, modern evolutionary theory accepts that evolution is still going on (therefore, man must still be evolving!), so if a Christian accepts evolution, he has to accept that God is still using evolution today. Thus, He is still creating. But God tells us that He finished His work of creating. This is a real dilemma for the theistic evolutionist.\n \n 2. New Heaven and New Earth:\n \n In Acts 3:21 we read: \"Whom the heaven must recieve until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by teh mouth of all His holy prophets since the world began.\" The Bible speaks of a time when this creation will be restored - that is, put back to what it used to be.Tis alone indicates that something is dreadfully wrong with today's world. For Christians who accept evolution, Paul's words about the whole of creation groaning and travailing in pain are meaningless.\n \n The same is true when one speaks of the new heaven and new Earth in which, as Scripture tells us, \"righteousness dwells\". Why is there need of a new heaven and new Earth unless there is something wrong with the old one (i.e. this one)? Isaiah 11:69 tells us what it will be like in the new heaven and New Earth:\n \n \"The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid (lamb); and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together, and a little child shall lead them. And teh cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. And teh sucking child shall play on teh hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall pu his hands on the cockatrice den. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the Earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.\"\n \n Here the description indicates that animals will not eat each other, but will eat plants (vegetarian) - and that there will be no violence or suffering. Revelation 22:3 tells us, \"And there shall be no more curse\". The logical thing to ask the theistic evolutionist is when was this curse placed on creation? To say that there was no curse placed on creation is to call Jesus a liar, \"This book is the record of the events that Jesus Christ revealed\" (Revelation 1:1). \n \n Revelation 21:4 states: \"And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.\"\n \n The description of what will happen in the restoration of all things can be summarized as follows: no death, no suffering, no bloodshed, no curse, vegetarian animals, no tears, no crying, no pain. This is not a description of todays world - yet it is a description of a restoration, of something that reflects its former state. \n \n When we read Genesis chapters 1 and 2, we find a description of teh original creation - no death, no violence, animals vegetarian. In other words, this present creation will be restored to what it used to be because there is something dreadfully wrong with it at the moment. If a person accepts evolution, then what is the restoration going to be? Death, struggle, and violence as we see today? Of course, this makes no sense of the teachings of the new heaven and new Earth given in the Scripture.\n \n The real last one that I would like to bring up is:\n \n 3. No Death Before Adam's Fall:\n \n The evolutionary processes is supposed to be one of death and struggle, cruelty, brutality, and ruthlessness. It is a ghastly fight for survival, elimination of the weak and deformed. This is what underlies evolution - death, bloodshed and struggle bringing man into existence. Death over millions of years. It is an onward upward 'progression' leading to man. Yet, what does the Bible say in Romans 5:12? Man's actions led to sin, which led to death. The Bible tells us that without the shedding of blood there can be no remission of sin (Hebrews 9:22). God institued death and bloodshed so that man could be redeemed through the blood of Jesus and reside with Him forever in the new heavens and new Earth. If death and bloodshed existed before Adam sinned, the basis for atonement is destroyed. \n \n Evolutionists would say death and struggle led to man's existence. The Bible says man's rebellious actions led to detah. These statements cannot both be true. One denies the other - they are diametrically opposed. That is why those who claim to hold both positions at the same time are destroying the basis of the Gospel. If life formed in an onward 'progression', what is sin? Sin would then be an inherited animal characteristic, not something due to the fall of man through disobedience. The many Christians who accept the belief of evolution add God to it destroy the very foundation of the gospel message they profess to believe.\n \n Most interestingly enough, even atheists realize the inconsistency in Christians believing in evolution, as seen in a quotation from an article by G. Richard Bozarth entitled \"The Meaning of Evolution\" from The Americian Atheists, September 1978, p. 19:\n \"Christianity is - must be - totally committed to the special creation as described in Genesis, and Christianity must fight will all its full might, fair or foul, against the theory of evolution ... It becomes clear now that the whole justification of Jesus' life and death is predicted on the existence of Adam and the forbidded fruit he and Eve ate. Without the original sin, who needs to be redeemed? Without Adam's fall into a life of constant sin terminated by death, what purpose is there to Christianity? None\".\n \n The atheist Jacques Monod (noted for his contributions to molecular biology and philosophy) said in an interview titled \"The Secret Life\", broadcast by ABC (Australian Broadcasting Commission) on June 10, 1976, as a tribute to him:\n \"Selection is the blindest, and most cruel way of evolving new species, and more and more complex and refined organisms ... the more cruel because it is a process of elimination, of destruction. The struggle for life and the elimination of the weakest is a horrible process, against which our whole modern ethic revolts. An ideal society is a non-selective society, it is one where the weak are protected; which is exactly the reverse of the so-called natural law. I am surprised that a Christian would defend the idea that this is the process which God more or less setup in order to have evolution\".\n \n Original sin, with death as a result, is the basis of the gospel. That is why Jesus Christ came and what the Gospel is all about. If the First Adam is only an allegorical figure, then why not the Last Adam (1 Cor. 15:45-47), Jesus Christ? If man did not really fall into sin, there is no need for a Saviour. Evolution destroys the very foundations of Christianity because it states, \"Death is and always has been, part of life\". \n \n If the basis of the Gospel (i.e. Genesis) is destroyed, the structure built on that foundation (the Christian Church) will largely collapse. If Christians wish to preserve the structure of Christianity, they must protect it's foundation and therefore actively oppose evolution (and certainly not compromise with it!).\n \n The above are only a few [there are many more reasons] why Genesis and evolution do not mix. As you should be able to understand, evolution is totally contradictory to the message of the Scriptures; and without the original sin who needs to be redeemed?\n \n Resource:\n \"The Lie Evolution\" ~ Ken Ham.",

We cannot prove that God is not ultimately behind evolution. Even as an atheist and a firm believer in evolution, I am fully prepared to admit that. It's simple logic.\n\n how is it logical to assume the presence of an unnecessary agent? evolution would work with or without the existence of any guidance, so what need is there to introduce a guiding factor?\n \n \nI'm aware that isn't a biblical quote, but nonetheless, I think it gets my point across.\n\n the term \"God works in mysterious ways\" is a scapegoat people give God when the biblical principles doesnt work. it is impossible to show that God works in mysterious ways, because the exact results would be obtained by assuming \"it just happened by chance\" or \"God didnt do anything\"\n \n \nBeasts of the field? Birds of the air? Man named them as he saw fit?\n\n thats what the scripture says\n \n \nI asked for a quote that says animals were created EXACTLY as they are today, that quote in no way supplies evidence for your assertion to that extent.\n \n What do you mean by \"existed at the time of creation\"? You mean in the first 5 days? Before humans were created? Or before creation all together?\n \n To the best of my knowledge, we do have cattle, or at least the prehistoric ancestors of cattle in the fossil record.\n \n Again, I'm quite sure we do have ancestral and transitional forms of sheep in the fossil record. I'll look for a link if you'd like.\n \n Where in the Bible does it say that sheep didn't exist prior to Abel?\n \n Who's to say that what Abel called a sheep, you and I would call a sheep? \n \n What if it was closer in nature to a modern mountain goat or muskox?\n \n That's exactly my point unkerpaulie, it IMPLIES, it does not state as fact or specify. Therefore your assertion is based on implications and assumptions, and ipso facto can NOT be presented as fact.\n\n you asked \"show me a scripture that states God created everything exactly as it is today\"\n \n Gen 2 shows that God created cattle, birds, and other animals on the 6th day that life appeared on earth. evolution says that there was nothing like birds or cattle around the time life appeared on earth. if we have cattle, sheep and birds today, and they were created as cattle, sheep and birds in genesis, then it clearly shows that at least these 3 types of animals were created exactly as they are today (or strikingly similar, however you want to look at it)\n \n as to your attempt to get technical with \"what abel may have called a sheep\", the writer of genesis used the word in his language that means sheep in ours. the message was that whatever meant sheep to him, is what abel called the animals he sacrificed. there was no message lost in translation as you are trying to suggest. its actually a weak and futile attempt to make a point you have no support for\n \n \nAn impossible task IMHO.\n\n i laid out plainly in my first post how the contradiction exists. you have shown nothing in way of a counterproof, yet you blankly assert that its impossible. i'm sure you can do better than that\n \n \nI'm way out of my league here, but it would seem to me that Genesis does not need to be read literally for these two precepts to be established. \n \n Further to that, does man literally need to fall, or can the fall be strictly figurative? Does Christianity truly need to be based on an actual physical literal event in order to be valid, or can it be based on a figurative event? For my money, the latter is more than sufficient, we're dealing with something that is not tangibly physical in the first place, we're dealing with the spiritual.\n \n Waxy\n\n i know you might not be able to give difinite answers, but i'll raise some questions regardless.\n - if there was no literal fall, then did the redeption from this fall require Jesus' literal death and resurrection, or was that figurative as well?\n - if the story of the fall is just made-up fiction, then is man literally fallen?\n - if man is only figuratively fallen, why is it necessary to believe that God literally exists?",

   "how is it logical to assume the presence of an unnecessary agent? evolution would work with or without the existence of any guidance, so what need is there to introduce a guiding factor?\n\n \n What does logic have to do with religion?\n \n \nthe term \"God works in mysterious ways\" is a scapegoat people give God when the biblical principles doesnt work. it is impossible to show that God works in mysterious ways, because the exact results would be obtained by assuming \"it just happened by chance\" or \"God didnt do anything\"\n\n \n Big Orn covered this.\n \n \nGen 2 shows that God created cattle, birds, and other animals on the 6th day that life appeared on earth. evolution says that there was nothing like birds or cattle around the time life appeared on earth. if we have cattle, sheep and birds today, and they were created as cattle, sheep and birds in genesis, then it clearly shows that at least these 3 types of animals were created exactly as they are today (or strikingly similar, however you want to look at it)\n\n \n Similar is not exact. Cattle, sheep, and birds are VERY broad terms.\n \n Cattle as we know them and refer to them today are not exactly the same as the cattle we referred to even 100 years ago. It's entirely within the realm of possibility that the cattle Adam was referring to were the initial ancestral forms of cattle as found in the fossil record. Same goes for sheep.\n \n As for birds, that's too broad a subject even bother with.\n \n \nas to your attempt to get technical with \"what abel may have called a sheep\", the writer of genesis used the word in his language that means sheep in ours. the message was that whatever meant sheep to him, is what abel called the animals he sacrificed. there was no message lost in translation as you are trying to suggest. its actually a weak and futile attempt to make a point you have no support for\n\n \n I'm not sure where the hostility in your last few posts is coming from unkerpaulie, at any rate, it's uncalled for. I've tried to refrain from returning in kind, and I will continue to try.\n \n I stand by the point. \n \n Words change, meanings change. We're dealing with thousands of years, with a story that's been copied and translated numerous times, and that is based on a story for which we have no direct connection to prove exactly what it is that Abel did or didn't call a sheep. \n \n You can dismiss all you want, but just like in a court of law, all I'm doing is casting reasonable doubt on the assertion.\n \n \ni laid out plainly in my first post how the contradiction exists. you have shown nothing in way of a counterproof, yet you blankly assert that its impossible. i'm sure you can do better than that\n\n \n I'm not sure what you're looking for.\n \n I've presented very simplistic arguments, but they've got the point across nonetheless. \n \n What would you accept as counterproof? \n \n Perhaps I could do better, but if you're waiting for me to present you with an essay based on biblical scholarship and detailed evolutionary theory, you're gonna have a long wait. Your initial post was about a paragraph in length, presenting your assertions based on you understanding of the Bible, why should I be expected to provide more than that in return? \n \n \ni know you might not be able to give difinite answers, but i'll raise some questions regardless.\n - if there was no literal fall, then did the redeption from this fall require Jesus' literal death and resurrection, or was that figurative as well?\n - if the story of the fall is just made-up fiction, then is man literally fallen?\n - if man is only figuratively fallen, why is it necessary to believe that God literally exists?\n\n \n I certainly can't give any kind of a specific answer.\n \n Sure, why not, in order to prove that the figurative fall was not simply a \"lauging matter\" it was required that Jesus' life, death and resurrection be literal. Or not.\n \n Sure, why not? Or, for that matter, why? If the allegory is based on a spiritual truth, whay can't man's fall be figurative or spiritual in nature as well? Why must it be a literal physical fall?\n \n Because he is the literal being that can help them overcome the fall, whether figurative or literal. Regardless of the fall being figurative or literal, the point that man has fallen remains the same.\n \n I could be right, I could be wrong, frankly, I don't know, it's out of my realm.\n \n Waxy",

   "nothing. logic can demonstrate whether 2 ideas are mutually exclusive or not\n \n \n regardless, the bible says that there were sheep, cattle and birds around when life began on earth. evolution says that there were no creatures ressembling anything like these when life began on earth. dont you see a difference?\n \n and why is anything required to be exact in the first place?\n \n \n i'll drop the hostility, because i agree that it was unnecessary\n \n heres the thing. you admit that you are in the dark about the significance of genesis in its literal context, yet you insist that both ideas can be accepted simultaneously, and now that i've stepped back and tried to look at it from your point of view, i understand what you are getting at. on a superficial level, yes, an allegorical (still not sure exactly what that is) version of genesis can be accepted and still subscribe to evolution\n \n where it gets tricky is tying in the concepts that christianity is based upon.\n - God is all-powerful (able to do and create anything and everything)\n - man is fallen and in need of reconciliation (man was once at a perfect state, but messed up and now all mankind is inherently sinful)\n \n if we accept evolution, then we accept that living creatures werent miraculously \"formed out of the earth\", nor man \"formed from clay\". also, there was single man and woman at any point in time that came to be the progenerators of all humans.\n \n we can now accept that genesis was entirely fictional and not in anyway based on actual events.\n \n the truth may actually more closely resemble this:\n mankind, being a social creature, but also possessing the ability to think and create, realized the ability to dominate not only other animals, but other humans. here is where oppression and hierarchy could begin, and people realized that pain and oppression was discomforting or \"wrong\", and people who caused the pain were \"evil\". then they consoled themselves in thinking that someday the tables will turn. maybe one of the early oppressors was eaten by a lion or something. this would spark the belief in a prehistoric version of \"karma\", and the belief that some \"greater force\" governs the \"good\" and judges the \"evil\". \"God\" was born\n \n the \"creaters and thinkers\" (those possessing more knowlegde) became evil by using their advantage to oppress others. it must have been thought that knowledge was the root of all evil, and since we all seek knowledge, we must all be inherently evil. \"genesis\" was born\n \n what my speculation boils down to is a story to gloss over what early civilization thought was the cause of the evil in the world where they believed in the existence of a God. however, none of these things actually happened, except figuratively. i.e., there was no adam, eve, serpent, perfect state, fall, tree or God. all the concepts developed as the story passed along from teller to teller\n \n from the time of abraham and his decendents (the progenerator of the israeli nation), the belief in God was apparently strong. even if it wasnt, the storytellers made it so that it was (he was the founder of their nation after all). anyway, moses and his company adapted the genesis stories after they left egypt, and took it to a whole new level. they were convinced that a messiah was needed to take away this \"sin\" from the world. mind you that this was based on the totally fictional account of genesis. the reality was that the israelites created among themselves a need for a savior from this \"sin\": a solution to a problem that apparently never existed\n \n (just a side note, genesis also became the convention for many beliefs of this time. for example, God was henceforth referred to as \"creator of heaven and earth\", and man referred to as \"sinful\" and \"dust\". incidentlly, when jesus came on the scene, and in paul's writings, he was commonly refered to as \"the second adam\")\n \n as prophecied, jesus appears, proclaims his divinity, and a legend is created around him. \"christianity\" is born\n \n this is basically a speculation, but what it does is offers an explanation for an allegorical genesis in the context of christianity. i am no historical scholar, i'm just trying to piece together what the storyline would be if we put the actual events in perspective.\n \n what i was hoping to get in response was a similar chain of events leading from evolution to christianity, and putting the creation story in perspective of what it really is. maybe (?, lol) i went about it the wrong way. \n \n can anyone offer or link a chain of events leading from evolution to creation and putting genesis in its perspective?\n\n \n Unkerpaulie,\n \n According to Pope John Paul II, the answer to your questions lies in the separation of the physical and the spiritual -\n \n \n6. With man, then, we find ourselves in the presence of an ontological difference, an ontological leap, one could say. However, does not the posing of such ontological discontinuity run counter to that physical continuity which seems to be the main thread of research into evolution in the field of physics and chemistry? Consideration of the method used in the various branches of knowledge makes it possible to reconcile two points of view which would seem irreconcilable. The sciences of observation describe and measure the multiple manifestations of life with increasing precision and correlate them with the time line. The moment of transition into the spiritual cannot be the object of this kind of observation, which nevertheless can discover at the experimental level a series of very valuable signs indicating what is specific to the human being. But the experience of metaphysical knowledge, of self-awareness and self-reflection, of moral conscience, freedom, or again, of aesthetic and religious experience, falls within the competence of philosophical analysis and reflection while theology brings out its ultimate meaning according to the Creator's plans. \n \n \n This is essentially how I perceive the two coexisting. Science is restricted to the physical, testable, and observable, religion is not. Based on that, I can wrap my head around \"theistic evolution\" or \"creationist evolution\" in so much as that God is working on the spiritual plane, while his work in the physical plane is done through evolution. \n \n Essentially, Genesis is allegorical in terms of the physical world and science, but at the same time, may be taken as literal in its laying of all the necessary groundwork in terms of man's spirituality.\n \n That's it, that's all, there ain't no more. :p\n \n Waxy",

   "any religion that depends on its members actually following and practicing its doctrine must in itself be practical. why should man aspire to be like moses, noah, abraham or even jesus, if these people were imaginary characters in a writer's head.\n\n \n Christianity is very practical, the core of its teachings in terms of interaction with society and its moral foundation are certainly a good point of reference for anyone in terms of how to go about their business in the world. The flip side, the more sinister side, is that it's also very practical tool with which to control the behaviour of a group of people, and maintain authority over them. \n \n Why not? We have \"superheroes\" and role models that we look up to every day. The very fact that these people are \"super human\" or extraordinary is what makes them desirable to emulate. It's the designation of \"perfection\" for people to strive towards. Everyone knows they aren't real, that doesn't make the characteristics they possess any less desirable. Even professional athletes fall into this category, they really are just normal people, complete with faults, but they have that \"superiority\" projected onto them, people strive to emulate them. \n \n What's the point of emulating Joe Sixpack down the street? \n \n \ncan we expect people to practice prayer, when the only documented cases of effective prayer was based in fiction? \n \n \n Again, separate spiritual from physical. \n \n \ncan we expect people to heal the sick, when all occurences of sick being healed were made up? \n \n \n I'm not sure healing the sick is the a key component of Christianity.\n \n \nas a fictional writer, i can have my charcters do anything, including the illogical and physically impossible. i cannot recommend that people attempt to do what a fictional character did. it would be absurd. so why is it that religions require its members to use the bible as a practical guide to their daily lives, if everything they use is only possible in the imagination?\n\n \n You might not reccommend they try leaping tall buildings in a single bound, but would you reccommend that they try to help others at all costs, always fight for good and not evil, live completely wholesome lives, etc...?\n \n I'm not sure what more you want from me Unkerpaulie.\n \n I'm really not sure why I'm the only one responding to this thread when I'm not a Christian and we're on a board full of Christians. :p \n \n Again, I think I'll leave my contributions at that.\n \n Hopefully someone else will be along to provide you the answers you're seeking.\n \n Waxy",
