   "Richbee is well known to those of us who have migrated here from the NY Times forums, where he has adopted these same tactics for years: post after post of long cut-and-paste, punctuated by out-of-context quotes, proclamations of argument \"victory,\" and contemptuous LOL's. (Before they changed their software, he also posted in different colors and font sizes as he does here.) He routinely asserts that the famously non-religious (Jefferson, Einstein, etc.) were actually Biblical literalists and that notorious \"believers\" like Hitler were actually Pagans. \n \n On the Times board, he (and his sidekick Easyrider) regularly violated the forum rules by posting under a myriad--at last count, over a dozen--different handles, and was by general consensus responsible for the closing down of the Religion forum there by driving away those interested in reasoned debate. (The Times ignore list has room for ten names. Virtually everyone's were completely taken up exclusively with Richbee handles.) He then switched over to the Gay Rights forum, which he's succeeded in ruining as well, the dialog the posters there having devolved into whether or not to respond to Richbee (whom they refer to as \"the Richbot\"). His posts are routinely deleted by the moderators, but the Times staff has become so lax in monitoring their forums, that the deletion was never fast enough.\n \n He is not at all interested in a true exchange of ideas or intellectually honest argumentation. He is like the man we have here in L.A. who stands on a street corner with a bullhorn and a sandwich board covered with Biblical passages, ignored by everyone and actively avoided by most, completely oblivious that his methods make him the worst conceivable advertisement for the religion he espouses. \n \n He is the ultimate religious-nut troll, and definitely a major loon.\n\n \n There's an Easyrider who just joined this forum. And he's an evangelical christian, apparently. Is this Richbee's sidekick from the other forum?",

(Ha, caught you in your own contradiction!)\n \n If everything was true, what then would be false?\n \n In conclusion, it is almost impossible to have a fair minded exchange such a person. \n \n Mahatma Gandhi said, that \"All Religions were Equal\", and this is clearly false, all Religions may appear superficially the same on the surface, but at their core, they all make contradictory truth claims. M.K. was very passionate for his cosmic humanism, but their were a great many dogmas that he rejected, like the caste system and animalism, or animal sacrifice.\n \n I do believe that tolerance is a blessing, and we can't go too far in asserting exclusive truth claims, although this was especially true for Gandhi, who was caught in a web of contradictions. He rejected who Jesus Christ was, and could only accept Jesus as a good moral teacher.\n \n I started a great thread on Gandhi over at TWeb, and posted a great deal of his writings and interviews. I would conclude that Gandhi was obsessed with Indian Independence from Great Britian. Not a bad cause to be obsessed about, and a cause he had energy, enthuiasm and passion for.\n \n emoticon_xbye Have a nice weekend! Keep running from the truth, and don't worry your naive thinking is locked up safe inside your mind.\n \n L8r,\n \n Rich\n \n P.S. OCD = Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (not disease)\n \n I believe there is a fine line between passion, enthusiasm, a flair for the dramatic and OCD.

If you don't believe as they do, you are considered \"lost.\" If you oppose their political positions, you are considered \"blinded by the Devil.\" And if you have the gall to argue against their made-truths, you will be called nothing short of \"demon possessed\" or a \"tool of Satan.\" \n \n But, as with any other addict, you should not take their attacks personally.

   "I don't have anything to add or to take away from what you all have posted. I asked Richbee what he could contribute to the building of the Kingdom and he never responded, so I just took it that he had nothing.\n \n I have seen these posts go on and on about arguing for God - or Christianity - and it just goes around and around and...\n \n I really wanted Richbee to be more to the point and can honestly say that some of what he posted was true, but was soon contaminated by unadulterated religion.\n \n He stated:\n \n , but never stated why he thought so.\n \n To him I suppose it was. But, I think we almost weeded the forum of bashing and misinformation and that's why it seemed dead.\n \n Richbee,\n As a Christian, I would like to know what all the babble would do for the \"Lost\" and \"Undone\"? The Bible is not a tool to use as a means of confusion or perplexity, nor should it be used to argue against some other belief system. It stands on its own. The Lord is not the god of confusion.\n \n I could argue all day about beliefs, but why? Jesus did not come to save the saved, which means He did not come to condemn...period.\n \n There is a difference between evil and those who are under its influence. I always get more results when I speak to the problem rather than those who are affected by it...and to those that are - I let my Yea be Yea, and my Nay, nay, lest I fall into condemnation.\n \n To me, to manipulate the Bible so that it fits into religion would be no better than what the scribes and Pharisees did in the days before they nailed Jesus to the cross. You do know who they were, really, don't you?\n\n Beautifully said.\n Ron, you always have a way with words even for us who don't believe.... (yet)\n :)\n Kudos for your patience",
