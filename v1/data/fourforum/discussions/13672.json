   "Gay Blog | Towleroad: More than gay news for more gay men.\n \n Mexican Cardinal Javier Lozano Barragan unleashed a torrent of offensive remarks about gays and trans people yesterday.\n \n Said Barragan, the retired head of the Vatican's Council for Pastoral Assistance to Health Care Workers: \"Transsexuals and homosexuals will never enter the kingdom of heaven and it is not me who says this, but Saint Paul. People are not born homosexual, they become homosexual, for different reasons: education issues or because they did not develop their own identity during adolescence. It may not be their fault, but acting against nature and the dignity of the human body is an insult to God. Homosexuality is therefore a sin, but this does not justify any form of discrimination. God alone has the right to judge. We on earth cannot condemn, and as human beings we all have the same rights.\"\n \n Vatican spokesman Jesuit Father Federico Lombardi responded to reporters' requests for a reaction:\n \"First of all I would like to point out that the site, pontifex.roma.it, lacks authority and is not a good source for understanding with objectivity the church's thoughts on complex and delicate issues like evaluating homosexuality. It would be better, for example, to refer to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, which does talk about homosexual acts as 'disordered,' but takes into account the fact that 'the number of men and women who have deep-seated homosexual tendencies is not negligible. [Homosexuals] must be welcomed with respect and sensitivity, and 'every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided.'\"",

There is no rational Secular reason to deny Gay people the right to marriage to the person whom they choose. Religion has defined Homosexuality as an Abomination but that does not make it true. I'm not Gay, But I defend their rights because they are Humans and should be treated as such. Religious zealots should mind their own business and worry about their own souls instead of worrying what others are doing. \n \n \n \n First of all they would have to prove that someone committed adultery which would be much harder than you suggest. I doubt you could find one instance where a church has a ban policy against adulterers getting married. I also don't think that any church can ban someone on the grounds of that person being Gay. that would go against the Constitution concerning discrimination. I would agree any church who openly speaks out against Gay people would be unlikely to have a need to implement a ban policy for Gay people. Most Gay people I know won't attend a church that would treat them in such a way to begin with.\n\n \n At the moment 'marriage' means the exlusive union of a man and a woman.\n If you want to redefine marriage then fine, but redefine it for every type of union that one can reasonably expect to be requested.\n Otherwise let gays call their union ' civil partnerships' or 'garriage' maybe but gay marriage would and should not be the same as hetero marriage.\n \n If you want to see how non religious people would react to homosexual marriage then introduce the happy couple into a blue collar enviroment..factory/ bar.\n I doubt that they would not be treated with suspicion and not a little derision.\n \n Proving adultery may or may not be as easy to prove as homosexual behaviour that has nothing to do with it.\n Some Christian groups do not tolerated either and will ban you from the group if you show that you will consistently do it\n \n I will also reiterate that the gays pride and LGBT do themselves no good with the overtly camp XXXX and pushing gay sex down youngsters throats( I refer you to my earlier post).\n Neither MLK or the black panthers refered to women as hoes , mah dick or promoted gangster rap.",

That's when the Religious Lobbyists pushed state Governments into \" RE_DEFINING\" Marriage as that between a Male and a Female.

Most Non-religious people don't bother worrying over someone elses' life or what others are doing. \n \n \n \n\n Proving adultery may or may not be as easy to prove as homosexual behaviour that has nothing to do with it.\n Some Christian groups do not tolerated either and will ban you from the group if you show that you will consistently do it\n\n \n This is where churches are most hypocritical. According to their own Bible \" All have sinned and fall short of the Glory of GOD.. so barring someone from attending church based on their sins goes against the very principle of which the churches were founded.

Related... yes all other versions of Christianity sprung from Catholicism, by historical necessity.\n \n Jesus came went and all the believers for the next thousand years were undergoing a severe delusion about what he said or did. (of course they were) but compared to the supplementing that delusion with the idea that you know after a thousand years even better what he said or did... and then calling the only organization to involve people who knew Jesus not christian..\n \n Incredible, all the more pitiable given how easily protestantism can be explained by the decadence of the church at that time and feudal desires for self-determination.\n \n The catholic church exists and existed because people decided at some point that there has to be a bottom line on scripture and that would be decided by the clergy.\n \n It is the exact same principle as precedence in modern courts of law, justice cannot change so the judge will preserve the appearance of justice being dolled out by never overruling a previous judgement.\n \n You can't go walking about proclaiming that the word of god is eternal and divine but then having people drag whatever meaning they want out of it (easy since it's got a phrase for everything and contradicts itself), so you got these people who decide whats truth.\n \n Bad right, all this coruption and power mongering and how illogical is it to think they have the truth, why wouldn't god speak to us all?\n \n So clearly the thing to do is invent a deeper more pure mysticism in which no matter which way you interpreted the bible everyone was right about it at the same time, oh yes you may have to form your own church.\n \n And so they do.\n \n Protestantism is the freeing of Christians to make up whatever mystical dreams they want without having to justify it. Of course that would succeed.\n \n We have the ultra refined stuff today, mysticism without the need to define or identify anything; just plain pure illogical condensed to your own personal internal fog and you can do what ever you feel like to nurture your 'spirituality', you can dabble in eastern mysticism (or so you think) with some yoga than you can commune with mother nature in the park.\n \n Religion has come full circle, it started out a chaotic mess of personal gods who are created and destroyed at whim and now it's going back to that and we are all excited because we don't know if absolute moral chaos is better or worse than the power hungry dictates of an ancient dealer in dogma.\n \n That was a long rant...",

First I'll ask a Question..\n \n When is the last time you heard of a out of closet Atheist being elected to the Congress, Senate, or White house?...\n \n point 2.. \n Churches in the U.S are tax exempt. They don't pay taxes on Contributions to their Church, the Government has no Say in how /where/why they spend the Money they take into a church. Sure we are not a true Theocracy, but we're heading in that direction every day that religion has a hold on our Government.\n \n Point 3. \n They passed DOMA.. specifically to deny Gay people the right to marry And Specifically for religious reasons. If religion in the U.S. Decides they need a Law to protect their Way they will go to any length to get that Law passed and implemented. \n They will even sell themselves out to Pass such Laws, case in point the Prop 8 bill in California. The Christians allied themselves with the Mormons to Bring that Bill Down and it was predominately Mormon Money that went into the Campaign against Prop 8. They Christians I know don't get along with Mormons, but they will follow one ( Glenn Beck) because he serves a common purpose.\n \n Religion is heavily ingrained in the U.S. Culture and our Government has broken the Constitution in order to appease religion, IMO that is about as close to becoming a theocracy as I'm comfortable with.",
