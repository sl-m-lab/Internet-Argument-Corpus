   "Hi there joebrummer:\n Many of the wars we have had have been on religion. \n \n How can you have a war that does not involve religion. Everyone is religious, even atheists. I count a religion as a belief, or a set of beliefs held to with adore; atheists (agnostics too) will always believe in what they believe in no matter what. Many wars have been fought over land as well, such as the Middle East crisis between Israel and Palastine. That said, religion is also involved. As is it involved with the fact that many Middle East nations dislike the United States.\n \n Many of the people who are spreading \"god's words\" are getting paid millions to be chrsitians. \n \n Not quite sure how you came to this very inaccurate statement. Perhaps it is a fragment of your very vivid imagination? Salvation Army officers in Australia, for example, are paid little over AU$5,000 for their work. This is just above the dole limit. Many overseas do not have much money either. Jesus Himself clearly says that it is easier for a cammel to fit through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to get into the Kingdom of God. All Christians must abide by this if they are to call themselves Christians - that is not to say that Christians shouldn't have appliances such as T.V's, computers, etc. \n \n and further more, as an atheist who could care less abour churches....If churches paid taxes, we could fund healthcare for the poor, feed the homeless. If you sold all of the gold crosses in all the catholic churches in the USA, we could most likely afford Social Security!\n \n As maximus explained, your argument backfired on you.\n \n To Dzeron:\n The United States is a mostly Christian nation. I think the figure is 70% or something like that. To be a completely Christian nation, 100% of the citizens must be Christians. \n \n Since Christianity is the main religion, we generally call it a Christian nation. Most  of your country's laws and values were based on the Bible. We also call many Islamic countries, such as Iraq, Palastine, and so on, Islamic nations - even though not all of the population is Islamic. Notice that the quote you cited didn't say \"completely a Christian nation\"? Countries where the people once honoured God, recognizing that \"God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself\" (2 Cor. 5:19), experienced unprecedented security and prosperity. Those same countries today are crumbling as people turn their backs on God. \"Righteousness lifts up a nation, but sin is a shame to any people\" (Prov. 14:34). Think about it, Europe and the United States have been so far ahead of the rest of the world scientifically and technologically, why? Because these countries had based their ways on the Word of God. It is not because we are any more advanced than them, but we have had our countries built on the righteous foundation of the Bible. Has any Islamic country, for example, launched any space shuttle [of their own] into space yet?\n \n To Ladywolf:\n A lot more medically advanced than ours for one. \n \n Then I guess it would surprise you to find out that most branches of modern day science had been started by Christian scientists, or had been significantly modified and advanced by Christian scientists, some examples:\n * Robert Boyle: Pioneer of modern chemistry.\n * Michael Faraday: pioneer of electric power.\n *Gregor Medel: father of genetics.\n * Joseph Lister: pioneer of modern surgery.\n * Louis Pasteur: did work in and made major contributions or created:\n - Bacteriology.\n - Biogenesis law.\n - Pasteurization.\n - Vaccination and immunization.\n * John Ambrose Fleming: pioneer of electronics.\n * Wilbur and Orville Wright: pioneer of aviation.\n * Wernher von Braun: pioneer of space exploration.\n * Isaac Newton: arguably the most tallented scientist and mathematician:\n - Law of Gravity.\n - Laws of Motion.\n - Calculus.\n - Reflecting telescope.\n - Optics.\n These are just to name a few. As you can see by concentrating on the two creation medical scientists I have mentioned (i.e. Louis Pasteur and Joseph Lister), we would be many years behind our current position in medical science. Please don't get the idea that I am proclaiming that evolutionary scientists do not do good science, because many of them do pretty good science. These names were taken from the book \"21 Great Scientists Who Believed the Bible\" by Ann Lamont.",

   "Hello Dzeron:\n 1) Our contries' Constitution was written by Deists. It's more influenced by the Enlightenment than Christianity.\n \n Much of the United States constitution is based on Christian vaules as it's underlying principle, the Bill of Rights is another example. Ah, was the first part of your statement (above) ment to be \"was not written by a deist\"? Or was it just stating a really warped version of what I was saying? I am saying that many of the values and laws of your country (assumption: America) are based on Biblical beliefs. If you are not from parts of Europe (and all parts of the Commonwealth) and the U.S., I apologise. I should have been more specific. I've never heard of the \"Enlightenment\" before. I know what enlightenment means, but when spelt with a capital \"E\" you've got me stumped.\n \n 2) China, Rome, and Turkey were all world powers in the past, yet they were \"heathen\" nations. In fact, Rome began to fall into decay as soon as it converted to Christianity.\n \n But the fall of ancient Rome led to the development of early Christian Europe and it's scientific advances and unprecedented prosperity. Besides, many of the Roman Emperors were over themselves and the people would have rebelled sooner or later. Was it not the Romans who believed the geocentric model of the universe? Who was it who provided evidence that this is not so? I believe it was a Bible believing Christian scientist. If anything, the scientists using the Bible with the underlying assumption that it is absolutely true, have accelerated science. But China's space program is just starting to go at a snails pace.\n \n 3) There is certainly no positive connexion between technology and religion. \n \n Maybe, maybe not. But it cannot be deined that Europe was much more technologically advanced than the Middle East, I am implying that the foundational  belief resulted in Europe experiencing unprecedented security and prosperity. This is just an observation.\n \n If anything, honoring the Word of God is damaging to scientific progress (a la Creation vs. Evolution.) Europe and the US are more technologically advanced because of their rationalist ideologies, not the Christian ideologies.\n \n As can be easily shown, evolution is not real science, but a belief system or religion about the past (molecules to man, and the big bang). Therefore, you would be incorrect if you were to use this as an example of God's Word damaging scientific progress and thus have an invalid case. Evolution is just the underlying principle that many scientists use (rather than creation) to do their science, such as geology and so on. They started with an evolutionary assumption and they got an evolutionary interpretation. Start with a creationary assumption and you will see the evidence fits perfectly what you would expect. What do you classify as \"rationist ideologies\"? Anything that does not involve God? Rational is defined, by the dictionary, as being able to reason; sensible. The Bible does not stop us from reasoning out as to why and how things work, such as why is the ozone hole over the South Pole and not at the Equator, and so on. If the Bible is the Word of God, would it not be rational (sensible) to base your science on this? Many scientists listed in above message did just this, and the results have forever changed science. \n \n Next we will deal with your \"Enlightenment\" thing which I have never heard of (when spelt with a capital \"E\").\n \n 1) Think for yourself (as opposed to drawing one's ideas from the Bible)\n \n The Bible does not stop this. Did Newton get his ideas about Calculus from the Bible? He thought up the whole thing himself. But assuming the Bible is all true, would it not be more sensible or rational to use it as a source for ideas? In fact, it would be irrational not to do so, would it not?\n \n 2) Scientific method (as opposed to Biblical method)\n \n And what is the \"Biblical method\"? Bible believing scientists use the scientific method. The Bible is not primarly a book about science - thank goodness it isn't, as the science books continually change ideas! The Bible says nothing in the way of or opposing the scientific method. The scientific method involves the following series of steps:\n \n 1. Observation. Information is collected from the results of experiments relating to a particular problem. Observing means more than \"seeing\" - it involves the five senses of sight, touch, taste, smell and hearing.\n \n 2. Classification. The observations are organised to see if any regularities or patterns exist. As a result, a problem is posed.\n \n 3. Hypothesis. A possible solution - an \"educated guess\" - to teh problem is proposed. This will suggest the new outcomes of new experiments. \n \n 4. Experiment. The predictions of the hypothesis are then tested to see if they occur. if not, the hypothesis is discarded and a new one proposed; new predictions are tested until experments show the hypothesis to be valid. \n \n Where is God or the Bible mentioned? Or where in the Bible does it say anything about not using it? Both creationists and evolutionists alike use this method when solving problems, such as how to get a rocket into space. What gasses will combust the best and how can we limit the output emissions?\n \n 3) Theories can be modified (as opposed to the ideo-static Bible)\n \n The moon dust theory is an example of this. It was proposed by Christians to account for the evidence of the day. The evidence no longer fits it, therefore the theory was dropped. I think you have a false impression of how Christian scientists do their science.\n \n 4) Question everything (as opposed to the Unquestionable Book)\n \n We do. Why does hot air rise? Why do we get seasons? How can we get faster and more efficient computers? For any observation we (both Christian scientists and atheistic scientists) question why and how the observation operates and/or does what it does. \n \n What you are really getting at is the topic of origins. You have very foolishly put evolution into science and as a result put science against God and religion. Science, of course, involves observation using one or more of our five senses (from above) to gain knowledge about the world, and to drepeat the observations. naturally, one can only observe what exists in the present. It is not a hard job to understand that no scientist was present over the suggested millions of years to witness the supposed evolutionary progression of life from the simple to the complex. No living scientist was there to observe the first life forming in some primeval sea. No living scientist was there to observe the first life forming in some primeval sea. No living scientist was there to observe the big bang that is supposed to have occurred 13 billion years ago. No scientist was there - no human witness was there to see thesee events occuring. They certainly cannot be repeated today. All the evidecne a scientist has exists only in the present. All the fossis, the living animals and plants, exists now, in the present. Scientists have only the present and cannot deal directly with the past. Evolution is a belief system about the past based on the words of men who were not there, but who are trying to explain how all the evidence of the present (fossils animals, etc.) originated. By Webster's Dictionary definition of religion, \"Cause, principle, or system of beliefs held to with ardor and faith.\" This is an apt description of the belief of evolution. Evolution is belief system about the past - a religion!\n \n With reference to origins, your argument makes a lot more sense. A Christian scientist will not change his/her view that God created everything just as is written in Genesis. He/she can, however, question the methods that God used to create things and as such, find evidence from the physical world that points to his/her hypothesis. An evolutionary scientist will not change his/her view that everything has evolved and can be explained by eons of natural processes. He/she can, however, question how this may have been done by finding evidence from the physical world that points to his/her hypothesis.\n \n Both the Christian scientist and the evolutionary scientist can change their theories about how everything was made - but NOT chaning their UNDERLYING assumptions, i.e. for Christian - God made everything as stated in Genesis, for evolutionist - everything made itself by time and chance over eons of years by natural processes. As you should be able to conclude, both creationary and evolutionary scientists follow the same methods, do the same sort of work, they just have different world views (or belief systems) about the past - which is where all the arguments occur. Do you realise that I agree with every single observation that an evolutionist makes? I don't disagree with the natural selection you see, I don't disagree with the changes you see. I agree with the biology we observe, the geology we observe. There is nothing that I disagree with an evolutionist that you observe. Which really makes the point that we disagree with interpretations of the evidence based on belief systems; which justifies why we start with the Bible, as opposed to rejecting the Bible like many evolutionists.",

I know what enlightenment means, but when spelt with a capital \"E\" you've got me stumped.\n \n \n I do live in the United States, and our Constitution was written by Deists. Very few of our legal principles are Bible-based - those that are are always under fire from the left.\n \n And to answer your other question, the Enlightenment is a term to refer to the time of Descartes, Voltaire, Locke and other philosophers who revolutionized Western thinking and effectively ended the Dark Ages.\n \n \nBut the fall of ancient Rome led to the development of early Christian Europe and it's scientific advances and unprecedented prosperity\n \n \n Whoa! Early Christian Europe had unprecedented prosperity? The Feudal Age? No, it wasn't until the Enlightenment that Europe began to progress again.\n \n \nBut it cannot be deined that Europe was much more technologically advanced than the Middle East\n \n \n Actually, during the Dark Ages (i.e. the age of theocracy) it was the Middle East that came up with most of the inventions of the time. Ever heard of the Ottoman Empire?\n \n \nWhat do you classify as \"rationist ideologies\"? \n \n \n The ideology of \"Question everything.\" Even the Bible.\n \n \nIf the Bible is the Word of God, would it not be rational (sensible) to base your science on this? \n \n \n It is irrational to assume that the Bible is the word of God. There is no evidence.\n \n \nThe Bible does not stop this [thinking for yourself]\n \n \n To an extent, it does. Jesus continually says \"believe in me\" - he emphasises blind faith over reason, and that isn't thinking for yourself.\n \n \nWe do. [question everything]\n \n \n Technically, if you don't question the Bible, then you don't question everything.\n \n \nevolution is not real science, but a belief system or religion about the past \n\n \n OK, maybe evolution was a bad analogy. But one thing is for sure - evolution is not a religion. Nobody worships the idea of apes evolving fom man (correct me if there's some crazy cult I don't know about.) Evolution is a theory derived from micro-evolution (i.e. we have observed species change and evolve during human history.)\n \n To call every belief system a religion is absurd. Maybe people should start converting to Democracy. Or let's send out the missionaries of Relativity. Be sure to go to the Church of Macchiavellianism every Sunday!\n \n Another, probably better analogy would be the imprisoning of Galileo.",
