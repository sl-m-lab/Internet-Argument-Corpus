   "I like that! USA has approved defence contract with Israel's military industrial complex over 300 million US dollars. According to published official information Israel Military Industries Company is to supply the Pentagon with light small-arms weapon and ammunition during 5 years. But as it turned out this weapon is designed not for American field forces but for... militants, located in Iraq and Afghanistan. In reality Yankees aim to overthrow Iraqi new regime by hand of these fellows. The matter is that the new President of Iraq (who pursues more radical line than America has ever planned to see after his coming to power) doesn't satisfy Washington's demands at all. Then was there any use in crossing swords and leading to power such US prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in Iraq? What violent and untalented policy! Nevertheless the first set of weapons should place under militants' orders several months from now. Taking into account rate of their arming and stepping-up of their training process, leaded by American military instructors, active combat actions may begin by the end of the year. A fine how-d'ye-do!",
