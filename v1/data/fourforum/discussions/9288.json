   "I believe that both sides are geniune in the arguements they present.\n \n People on the pro-life side, at least all that I have personally met or debated with, genuinely seem to believe that abortion is the equivalent to murder. Most seem to have a genuinely felt sympathy for the embryo/fetus, whose life they view as being as valuable as any life of a born-person. For them, any consideration of the mother's rights to her body are secondary to the rights to life of that embryo or fetus. Given that they equate the abortion of the fetus with murder, they are no more responsible for others than people who are against murder (of born people) are responsible for others. \n \n Most pro-choice people seem to either believe that a mother's right to her own body supersedes any rights of the fetus (independent of its state of development of body or mind, etc.) or that (as with my own views) the earlier state of the embryo/fetus is so underdeveloped that it cannot be viewed the same way as born people are viewed so, in the balance of rights, its rights to life lose out to those of the mother.\n \n I think the main problem arises since Pro-Life people have utterly failed in presenting a compeling case as to why embryos/early fetuses should have rights superseding that of the mother, and Pro-Choice people have failed in convincing Pro-Life people that mother's rights should take precedent. Partly, it lies with many Pro-Life arguements being based on religious claims or otherwise unsupported arguements, mixed with an apparent view of women with unwanted pregnancies as being morally deficient. Partly, it lies with the arguements against the early fetus' worth being based on Scientific arguements that reject religious notions such as the soul, which is unacceptable to those who are religious. Partly, it lies in the fact that the source of human consciousness is still not clearly understood, which leads many to a \"better safe than sorry\" approach of outlawing all abortions lest a real \"person\" gets killed.",

It seems whenever sometime tries to defend a \"substantive due process\" idea , it comes back to the idea that they think judges have the job of making moral judgments.\n\n \n Agreed, it would be the judgement of SCOTUS what rights would require more scrutiny. Since any rights that do not receive this scrutiny would still have the procedural guarantee you assert is the only component, this can hardly be the herald of doomsday you make it seem to be. Substantive Due Process is additional protection of our freedom, we do not receive less protection on any other rights.\n \n Personhood is not a moral concept in this decision. This decision was not a moral judgement. They looked at the intent and wording of the Clause.

The point seems to be what can occur now, not whether or not it should.

An embryo might be prevented from growing larger, but thats not a big deal. And second, why did the person who got shot leave his home? He shouldn't have left his home if he didn't want to get shot. He needs to take responsibility!\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThat's exactly the point. Actions have consequences. Every person engages in a sort of risk analysis. Sometimes there are consequences to risky behavior.\n\n \n You're right. Such as driving. Its all your fault if you die in a car accident, because you decided to drive that day. Heck, its your fault if you got kidnapped and murdered, because you left your home.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSometimes democracies do things that are just plain wrong. That's an unfortunate consequence to democracy. But in spite of that fact, we still have a democracy.\n\n \n Should we have votes on how to cut my hair? Should we have votes on what color clothes you can wear? Should we have votes in the time when you go to the bathroom? Fine, then I vote that this is not something that should be voted on.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI know this. But most people would view those people as out of touch and wrong. Which is, by the way, why prostitution is still illegal. The majority doesn't like it, so they banned it.

I begin with the most cautious position, which is that a human being (morally valuable entity) exists from the point of conception. I for one have seen no logical and consistent argument showing that it is not.

Why consciousness? Why only consciousness?\n\n \n Well, think of it this way. Let's say we remove the brain of a person and put it in a jar while keeping the body alive. Where, now, does the person, the being, the moral entity now reside? In the jar with the brain or on the table with the body? Or is a new person created with this process?\n \n During the time-frame the vast majority of abortions occur, there is no complex cerebral cortex and no major central nervous activity. That is a condition universally regarded as a state of death in adults. Unplugging an adult human would not destroy their individual existencce because that has already ceased to be. Even if we regrew the brain using the DNA of the body, we would not recreate the person that was. We would, in essence, have created a new infantile mind ready to learn and grow anew. Nothing outside what is shared between identical twins of the previous personality would exist.\n \n \nI do not see where such a \"right to own one's body\" exists. It's that simple.\n\n \n A 'right to bodily integrity' is considered to exist in that there is a certain expectation of privacy around the use of ones body that is protected\n \n Except in certain narrowly limited cases, the Court repeatedly has stated its 'insist[ence] upon probable cause as a minimum requirement for a reasonable search permitted by the Constitution.' Chambers v. Moreny, 399 U.S. 42, 51 ('70). Because '[t]he integrity of an individual's person is a cherished value in our society,' searches that invade bodily integrity cannot be executed as mere fishing expeditions to acquire useful evidence: 'The interests in human dignity and privacy which the Fourth Amendment protects forbid any such intrusions on the mere chance that desired evidence might be obtained.' Schmerber, 384 U.S. at 772, 769-70.\n \n And\n \n [T]he Supreme Court in Winston v. Lee, 470 U.S. 753 ('85), recognized that Schmerber's threshold standard was a requirement of probable cause 'where intrusions into the human body are concerned,' which implicate 'deep-rooted expectations of privacy.' Id. at 761, 760.\n \n And\n \n The Court contrasted this lesser bodily invasion, which the Schmerber Court had upheld upon demonstration of probable cause, with the more drastic measure of dangerous surgery to recoup criminal evidence, which the Winston Court concluded would violate the individual's Fourth Amendment rights even when supported by probable cause. Thus again, the context of the quotation demonstrates that the Court places blood extraction squarely within the probable cause requirement because it is an invasion of bodily integrity, while at the same time acknowledging that it is a less extensive imposition on dignitary interests than surgical removal of a bullet.\n \n And\n \n Fourth Amendment protects the 'right of the people to be secure in their persons . . . against unreasonable searches and seizures.' The essence of that protection is a prohibition against some modes of law enforcement because the cost of police intrusion into personal liberty is too high, even though the intrusion undoubtedly would result in an enormous boon to the public if the efficient apprehension of criminals were the sole criterion to be considered. 'The easiest course for [law enforcement] officials is not always one that our Constitution allows them to take.' Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 595 (Stevens, dissenting).\n \n And\n \n Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, in Washington v. Glucksberg (1997):\n The Due Process Clause guarantees more than fair process, and the \"liberty\" it protects includes more than the absence of physical restraint. In a long line of cases, we have held that, in addition to the specific freedoms protected by the Bill of Rights, the \"liberty\" specially protected by the Due Process Clause includes the right to marry, to have children, to direct the education and upbringing of one's children, to marital privacy, to use contraception, to bodily integrity, and to abortion. We have also assumed, and strongly suggested, that the Due Process Clause protects the traditional right to refuse unwanted lifesaving medical treatment.",

That includes abortion, life tenure for congressmen, and congressional appointment of the President (which was, incidentally, how it was done in the beginning).\n\n Looking up presidential election history, I did notice that, indeed, the original presidential electors were appointed by state legislature - not by popular election. Interesting. So, I would agree that more aspects of the government and rights we take for granted can be changed than most of us believe. However, the question remains whether EVERYTHING in the Constitution can be changed under popular vote. That is still not completely clear - just speculation. Quoting from http://www.usconstitution.net/consttop_newc.html :\n \nIn fact, the Constitution has no provision, directly, for full-scale change. There is, however, the concept of the Amendment Convention as noted in Article 5. The power or limits of such a convention are unknown because there has never been one. It is thought, however, that a Convention would be able to propose any change to the Constitution it decided to, including full replacement.\n\n I shutter to think of the implications to our nation if certain rights that we take for granted are taken away by popular vote of religious extremists. I guess there isn't that very much stopping us from starting to burn witches again ... or would it be burning Gays or women having abortions in this case? (Granted, I am making a gross exaggeration, but it makes the point - we need to have SOME assumed and untouchable rights as human beings).\n \nI tend to look at this differenlty.

I for one have seen no logical and consistent argument showing that it is not. All the attempts rely on arbitrary and discriminatory criteria which many times can also apply to those entities that everyone would concede is a human being (morally valuable entity).\n\n I think we all agree that unfertilized eggs are not people and that, once we are born, we are most definitely people. So, when does the transition to \"personhood\" or, if you prefer, human being or morally viable entity, happen? (I will use the term person from hereon in). What development is critical to changing a non-person into a person?\n \n A moment after conception, two major things have changed the unfertilized egg to a fertilized one:\n 1) The cell has acquired a second set of human DNA, making for a complete set.\n 2) The process of growth has started that will cause that cell to divide into cells that eventually specialize, become our organs, our brains, and eventually our beings. However, at this precise moment in time, it is just one cell with a complete set of DNA and the potential for growth.\n \n What makes that a person? Which of those developments do you consider so very critical and why? Is it the POTENTIAL for becoming more? If so, why do you not also cherish the potential of the unfertilized egg and require all eggs to be fertilized?\n \n There are many developments that happen along the way toward birth. Some of these include (not necessarily in order):\n 1) The development of crude initial organs.\n 2) The heart first starts to beat.\n 3) The embryo first starts to become visibly recognizeable as human.\n 4) The first brain cells are formed.\n 5) The first scattered brain activity is registered.\n 6) Brain activity of the cerebral cortex which scientists require for any conscious or sub-conscious thought begin.\n 7) Viability given our current technology.\n 8) Birth\n \n Are one of those developments critical for you? For me, I have a similar view to that of Sigma, Shooter and others that, essentially, the entity has to have at least a rudimentary mental existence to be considered a person (or morally viable entity). Though it is unclear when exactly this starts and to what degree, Science tells us that this cannot happen before the cerebral cortex is sufficiently developed - sometime near the beginning of the third trimester.\n \n Of course, you might claim that a Scientific view is insufficient and that one has to include a supernatural / religious view of a soul, etc. However, that is just guesswork on your part and on the part of organized religion, with no evidence to point to... which leads us back to the question of whether a majority can impose their religious views on the whole populace.",

   "We are also unique because of our intelligence. If humans weren't intelligent then we'd be\n\n \n Stupid humans?\n \n \nNot at all, this is just a moot comparison. Its more like this, theres a 50% chance its your buddy and a 50% chance its a bear that will jump out and kill you, and you know it. And, you know that if it was your buddy, you would see an orange vest (hunters wear them). But, there is a slight chance that he just lost his vest. Therefore, there is a large possibility it was a bear, but no a 100% possibility. If it were me with those odds, I'd shoot low, so I wouldn't kill him. That is relating to early term abortion. Its much more complicated than just a rustling bush, and i believe my analogy is more accurate.\n\n \n This is ridiculous. You have a knack for missing the point. That's ok though.\n \n Suppose that it was time to demolish an old football stadium. If there was an uncertainty, would the demolition crew operate on the assumption that everyone was already out and blow up the stadium, or would they exercise caution by postponing the demolition until they were positive that everyone was out? They would make the cautious assumption and not demolish until they were absolutely sure that no one was in the stadium.\n \n \nI wouldn't either, but this is completely irrelevant to the abortion debate. What do appearances have to do with anything?\n\n \n You brought up appearances, not me.\n \n \nIt is such a simple concept to grasp, i fail to understand why you cannot grasp it. Levels of intelligence and IQ tests are irrelevant. I am talking about more what Another Opinion calls \"mental existance\".\n\n \n Then it would be helpful for you to use the appropriate language so as not to generate confusion.\n \n \nAnd it hasn't happened over 1 million times. Shall we go into statistics about unfertilized eggs too?\n\n \n So, according to you, there is a 300:1 chance that an embryo will grow into a fully developed human being, while there is zero chance that a fingernail or piece of hair will. Can you really not recognize that the embryo is wholly different from either a fingernail or a hair?\n \n \nNo it does not. It has the possibility to, but it also has almost a 1 in 4 chance of miscarrying. Unfertilized eggs also have the possibility of becoming a human being. Every sperm cell has the possibility.\n\n \n No. A sperm cell by itself will never grow into a fully developed human being. For someone who claims to be all about science, you surely have ignored it in this statement.\n \n My statement is not that the embryo has the possibility to BECOME a human being, but that it ALREADY IS a human being.\n \n \nBS, no you did not.\n\n \n Aside from the fact that no one has yet to justify the claim that one has a right to own their own body (that is, no one has shown this to be true), I have given adequate evidence to show that it is not.\n \n For example, it is criminal in most jurisdictions to prostitute one's own body no matter how badly they may want or need to.\n \n It is also illegal in most jurisdictions to do many things with one's body in public.\n \n If a right to own one's body actually existed, then all of these prohibitions would be unacceptable.\n \n Now, if you could be so kind, please provide evidence that a right to own one's body actually exists.
