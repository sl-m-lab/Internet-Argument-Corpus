It is discussing the economic political ramifications of the US trade/government deficit. A fairly good and long read. For all of you \"conservatives\" please note the CFR is not known for being a limp wristed anti American Liberal think tank.\n \n \n\n The U.S. current account deficit -- the gap between what the United States earns abroad and what it spends abroad in a year -- is on track to reach seven percent of GDP in 2005. That figure is unprecedented for a major economy. Yet modern-day Panglosses tell us not to worry: the world's greatest power, they say, can also be the world's greatest debtor. According to David Levey and Stuart Brown (\"The Overstretch Myth,\" March/April 2005), \"the risk to U.S. financial stability posed by large foreign liabilities has been exaggerated.\" Indeed, they write, \"the world's appetite for U.S. assets bolsters U.S. predominance rather than undermines it.\"\n \n But in fact, the economic and financial risks that arise from the U.S. current account deficit (and the resulting dependence on foreign financing) have not been exaggerated. If anything, they have received too little attention -- and are set to grow in the coming years.\n \n Levey and Brown make three basic arguments. First, they claim that foreign central banks will probably continue to finance U.S. deficits. Second, they predict that even if foreign central banks do pull back at some point, private investors will step in. And finally, they assume that even if this financing does not materialize, a dollar crash would hurt Europe and Japan more than it would hurt the United States. Unfortunately, there is a good chance that all of these assumptions will prove false. Foreign central banks may well stop financing growing U.S. deficits, private equity investors might not take their place, and the resulting adjustment process would prove quite painful for the United States.\n \n snip\n \n The current account deficit will continue to grow on the back of higher and higher payments on U.S. foreign debt even if the trade deficit stabilizes. That is why sustained trade deficits will set off the kind of explosive debt dynamics that lead to financial \n \n snip\n \n foreign central banks probably increased their dollar reserves by almost $500 billion, providing much of the financing the United States needed to run a $665 billion current account deficit. These banks are not buying dollar-denominated bonds because they are attracted to U.S. economic strength, the high returns offered in the United States, or the liquidity of U.S. markets; they are buying them because they fear U.S. weakness\n \n snip\n \n Thus far, China has used price controls to keep prices from rising, but such controls, which cause deep distortions in the economy, cannot keep the lid on inflation forever. Eventually, rising domestic prices will erode China's competitiveness even if it keeps its currency pegged at its current level. China is likely to let its currency appreciate rather than accept socially and politically destabilizing inflation.\n \n \n snip\n \n Levey and Brown further argue that even if foreign central banks scale back their financing, there is little to worry about, since the United States is on the verge of a new information technology (IT) revolution that will attract a new wave of investment from abroad. Alas, there is little evidence to suggest this pleasant scenario will come to pass. In both 2003 and 2004, equity investors took more than $150 billion out of the United States: U.S. direct investment abroad exceeded foreign direct investment in the United States, and U.S. purchases of foreign stocks exceeded foreign purchases of U.S. stocks. High equity inflows are more likely to come because a further fall in the dollar makes U.S. assets fire-sale cheap than because of a scramble to get in on another IT boom. \n \n snip\n \n Foreigners made up the difference last year, buying enough U.S. Treasuries to fund the entire budget deficit. But without access to this easy financing from foreign central banks, the U.S. government and the U.S. electorate will have to make the kinds of unpleasant choices they have thus far avoided: among guns, butter, pork, tax cuts, and low interest rates.\n \n snip\n \n Arguing that deficits -- external as well as domestic -- do not matter does not make them go away. Celebrating the United States' real economic strengths while ignoring the real -- and growing -- economic vulnerabilities associated with unprecedented current account deficits is dangerous. \n \n snip\n \n LEVEY AND BROWN REPLY\n \n Brad Setser and Nouriel Roubini portray us as modern-day Panglosses for expecting an orderly adjustment of global economic imbalances and sustained U.S. hegemony. But to us, they are would-be Cassandras who gravely warn of U.S. decline just like the armies of \"imperial overstretch\" aficionados before them. Because Setser and Roubini misconstrue the causes of current imbalances, they lay the principal blame for these imbalances on U.S. macroeconomic policy, while ignoring European and Japanese stagnation and Asia's problematic economic policies. The United States, in their view, stands alone at the precipice, facing a stark choice: restore fiscal sanity to eliminate external imbalances or confront the prospect of nervous central banks severing the country's tenuous financial lifeline and setting it on the path to decay.\n \n continued\n \n\n \n \n \n [/quote]\n \n for fracas in particular.\n \n\n Economic power usually flows to creditors, not debtors. While the United States roams the world looking to sweep up any spare savings to finance its huge deficits, China roams the world looking for new places to invest its surplus savings -- including in oil and gas resources and in states that Washington has judged pariahs. This is a far cry from the early days of the Cold War, when the United States used its surplus savings to finance the reconstruction of its allies, cementing political alliances with strong economic ties.\n \n",

   "http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1005512/posts\n \n \n Despite the barrage of negative press regarding the national deficit, a little research reveals the news is far less dire than it is being portrayed. \n The gross domestic product (GDP), which forecasts the amount of money taken in through taxes by the government versus the amount of government spending, is best looked at in percentages as the nation's economy continues to grow each decade. According to the Office of Management and Budget, a comparison of administrative deficits for the last 20 years is as follows: \n Reagan 1983 $208 billion deficit 6% GDP \n Bush 1992 $290 billion deficit 4.7% GDP \n Clinton 1993 $255 billion deficit 3.9% GDP \n Bush 2003 $374 billion deficit 3.5% GDP \n What the majority of articles bemoaning the national deficit do not remind people is that the terrorist attacks of 9/11 cost our economy a minimum of $500 billion including $150 billion in reduced GDP. This does not include the cost of fighting the war on terrorism. The cost for that is approximately 3% of GDP versus approximately 10% GDP during the height of the Cold War. Considering two years ago our nation endured its largest attack at the heart of its financial center, as well as an expensive war on terrorism, two tax cuts and numerous corporate scandals, \n A 3.5% deficit in GDP does not seem unreasonable and on a percentage basis is still lower than we've seen in 20 years. \n In addition, the record deficits in California continue to have a negative impact on our national economy. California is the world's fifth largest economy and their breathtaking social experimentation in recent years has resulted in a state dangerously close to needing a national bail-out. \n The majority of economists have attributed the recent strength in consumer spending to the Bush tax cuts. We have already seen tremendous growth in the last quarter, and most of that has been attributed to people having more money to spend. \n Contrast the Bush tax cuts with the money the Democrats would spend if they had the majority. In the last 3 years, The Democrats, who say they want to reduce the deficit, have tried to add nearly $2 trillion in budget bills, more than all of Bush's tax cuts combined.",

   "\n The majority of economists have attributed the recent strength in consumer spending to the Bush tax cuts.\n\n \n According to whom? Most economists attribute large parts of the deficit to bush's tax cuts. Furthermore the tax cuts didn't send money to the people who would spend it the most. Sure the tax cuts on average gave every American $1000, but in actuality the vast majority of the money went towards a tiny minority of taxpayers. Supply side economics doesn't have any proof of actually doing what it says it does. \n \n Much of the growth can be attributed to defense spending. \n \n \nWe have already seen tremendous growth in the last quarter, and most of that has been attributed to people having more money to spend.\n\n \n Except that real wages haven't changed in decades and the majority of spenders in the US are now being hit with higher bills reducing their consumption incomes. Something doesn't add up with Peach's article when compared to the real world. \n \n \nContrast the Bush tax cuts with the money the Democrats would spend if they had the majority. In the last 3 years, The Democrats, who say they want to reduce the deficit, have tried to add nearly $2 trillion in budget bills, more than all of Bush's tax cuts combined.\n\n \n Kenysians economics does work, and Bush himself is a example of this growing the Gov't spending by leaps and bounds.",

   "As an accountant I may be biased but I do believe that we know when the sh*t is about to hit the fan and considering we have the closest access to the real number we should be trusted more than most....thus people making decisions based on financial statements and audit reports as opposed to what management thinks.\n \n So when the GAO says the follow, perhaps we should be a bit worried:\n \n \nOver the next few decades, the nation's fiscal outlook will be shaped largely by demographics and health care costs. As the baby boom generation retires, federal spending on retirement and health programs-Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid-will grow dramatically. A range of other federal fiscal commitments, some explicit and some representing implicit public expectations, also bind the nation's fiscal future. Absent policy change, a growing imbalance between expected federal spending and tax revenues will mean escalating and ultimately unsustainable federal deficits and debt.\n \n To analyze and monitor changes in the long-term fiscal outlook, GAO maintains a long-term model of the federal budget and the economy. This model was adapted from work done at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. For over a decade, GAO has published the results of its long-term budget simulations in reports, testimonies, and other products. The model's results dramatically illustrate the need for action sooner rather than later to address the long-term fiscal imbalance.\n\n \n but no one listens to us -_-",
