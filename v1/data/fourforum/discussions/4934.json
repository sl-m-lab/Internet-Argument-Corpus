   "April 25, 2005 | On Feb. 16, 2000, Matthew Limon gave his boyfriend a blow job and got himself a 17-year prison sentence. The boys were residents at the Lakemary Center, a school for developmentally delayed youngsters in Paola, Kan. It's generous, perhaps, to call them boyfriends. What they did was more akin to sexual experimentation, two boys in a dormitory at night, messing around. Matthew had just turned 18 the week before, and his partner was just shy of his 15th birthday. The younger boy, identified only as M.A.R., consented to the sex, but changed his mind. As soon as he asked Matthew to stop, Matthew did, and M.A.R. has always been steadfast in his statement that what happened was consensual. How the police were brought in, why they were called, isn't clear. Someone from the center complained and the trial was based on stipulated facts -- one paragraph stating that on that night in February, the boys engaged in consensual oral sex. That single paragraph was the basis for the 17-year sentence.\n\n \n http://www.salon.com/mwt/col/waldman/2005/04/25/limon/index_np.html",

   "If they were both developmentally delayed, then it seems bizarre to lock one of them up. The sentence certainly seems excessive. That said, in normal circumstances an eighteen year old involved in a sex act with a 15 year old has some pretty fast talking to do. Difficult to know without knowing more details of the boys developmental states.\n \n EDIT: that fact that he'd have got off pretty lightly had his partner been female does tend to tip the balance in his favour. That said, personally I still think it's a pretty big age gap for teenagers.",

He had essentially been sentenced to the center in Paola instead of prison.\n \n Regardles of whether the romeo and juliete law would have applied or not, this was his third sex crime in 5 years, all felonies (the R&J laws in KS do not remove it to a misdemeanor). We are funny about things like that. We generally feel that sexual predators should be restrained rather than wandering around in public. \n \n This actually upset me enought to make some calls. Apparently he was not already in prison becuse someboduy along the wway felt sorry for him becuase he was mildly retarded, so instead of locking him up for 10 years on the second offense, they sent him to a home. \n \n So, yes, he is going to spend the next chunk of his life in prison. No, I do not feel sorry for him, and when he gets out, he will be supervised for 5 years, not be allowed to live near a school or day care, will have to register a sa sexual offender. This is what we do with sexual predators here. I have no apologies.",
