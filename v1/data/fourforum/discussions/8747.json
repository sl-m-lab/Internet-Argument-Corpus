   "Countless times those who accept the reality of \"natural law\" have tried to explain it to me and they have always failed because their explanations never made any sense to me. The following, however, makes a great deal of sense to me:\n \nIntelligent design boosters say that if life only develops by random chance, as Darwinists say, then we're living meaningless lives. \n \n Right, that's the moral meme. But they're confusing human meaning with natural meaning. There is no natural meaning in the universe. Nobody, Christian or otherwise, would look at a star and go, What's the meaning of that? It doesn't mean anything. It's a bunch of atoms. Believers and non-believers alike are comfortable saying human life has meaning because we make it so. That goes for Rick Warren and Dr. Phil. They say, hey, look, man, you got to go out there and do it yourself. You got to volunteer and help the poor. We give our life meaning by being helpful and sociable. \n \n Well, that's Darwinian. We evolved as a social primate species in which we had to cooperate to get along. It's not random, there are parameters defined by our own human nature. If these guys want to say, well, that's how God did it, OK, that's fine. But let's keep studying it scientifically to understand why that would have come about through natural forces. \n \n In the end, you don't need a top-down entity to give life meaning. If anything, if nobody is out there, it is much more important to find meaning ourselves. Instead of this world being a mere staging for the next world of eternity -- meaning it doesn't really matter what we do now -- it's better to realize there is no eternity, that this is it. In that case, we better be careful what we do, make our choices consciously, treat people kindly and be moral because this life is what really counts. \nSkeptics Society founder Michael Shermer in an August 23, 2006 interview in Salon.",

   "I am attempting to read Rouseau.\n \n My God! What a nutcase! But, what marvelous language he wrote. \"Man is born free but everywhere he is in chains.\" Grabs you right by the throat.\n \n However, I start to argue with Rousseau in his first page of Chapter Two of his First Book on The Social Contract. Rouseau keeps yammering on about the \"natural bond\" of the family which continues only so long as children need their \"father\" for their preservation. Not one bloody mention of mother, for Christ sake! Who has lent her body for nine long months to each and every individual child, save for the incidence of twins or other multiple births? Who has gone through the travail of giving birth to place those children in the world? Who, Rousseau, who? \n \n Of course, Rousseau's mother died shortly after his birth, so perhaps he can be forgiven for knowing nothing of the role of mothers--and his father appears to have been an insane brute. So, what the devil does Rousseau really know about families, inasmuch as he came from a most dysfunctional family. \n \n My judgment about his strange behavior throughout his life, he seems to have endlessly fell in love with various women throughout his life without any meaningful depth in his feelings for them. Searching for his lost mother, perhaps. My assessment also, is that he was daft and may have been guilty of exposing himself to various women, they were sensible about him and considered him a nuisance but not dangerous.\n \n His world view was not sophisticated in the least, limited as it was to the confined society of Swiss canton, which he appears to have idealized in his \"Social Contract.\" I concede that he has added a great deal to the world discussion of governance and must be forgiven much because of his pitiful beginnings. One can learn much from Rousseau, I hope that I may do so if I could only stop arguing with him.\n \n I acknowledge a fondness for the wit of Voltaire. I thought Candide hilariously funny but my mother didn't seem to think it was funny, that it was rather tragic. Yes, Mother, it was a tragic time but Voltaire's black comedy, alas, how we must laugh in the midst of great horror, it may help to keep us sane through the madness of life.\n \n And, was it Candide who repeatedly said, \"But I have only one buttock,\" throughout Voltaire's riff, was that not a play on Rousseau's \"confessions\"?",

   "Thanks, Inyx. A nice assessment. Rommen seems to credit Plato with the first major codification of the concept of \"natural law.\" It would be, Plato, of course.\n \n I'm not sure that I agree with Rommen's consideration of Rousseau. Rommen's book was published in 1936 and there has been an ongoing love and hate relationship with Rousseau since his unhappy life. He was damned initially for being opposed to the trappings of civilization, falsely held responsible for the excesses of the French revolution, reassessed at a far later date as being, in his way, an advocate of bending to social will.\n \n I guess it would be an interesting task to determine how Rousseau defined civilization. I don't think he utterly damned civilization, he just weighed upon what it might have been like in days before, perhaps the critical factor is, ownership, property rights, and the time when individuals were held capable of ownership of land, property, etc., with certain rights included in that ownership. In the time of paradise, the Garden of Eden, one gathered food wherever one found it, everything belonged to everyone. I suppose primitive law allowed that if one had slain an auroch or elk or whatever sort of beast, one was first entitled to the spoils of the hunt, but it probably was incumbent upon the hunter to share the meat with his compatriots, family, tribe, whatever. In any event, the flesh of the beast would rapidly spoil and become uneatable so it was sensible to share the food and strengthen the group so that another hunter would fell the next beast for sharing.\n \n Berries from any bush belonged to any hand that gathered it. After the determination that one held property rights, one could not gather berries from a bush if the bush belonged to someone else. One could not slaughter a cow belonging to someone else for food, cattle rustlers were hunted down and hung, the rights of property ownership were rigidly enforced.\n \n At this point, I don't know if Rousseau had anything to say about property rights and ownership.",
