First of all there is radiometric dating, which is based on the fact that many different isotopes of different elements decay at constant rates. They have found that the map of creatures in time has slowly changed and evolved. First there were sponges in the sea. Then there were Jellyfish who had the ability to move, then there were flatworms with the ability to sexually reproduce (that's as far as we are in the timeline of life in biology so far). Gradually creratures had different abilities and these things took millions of years. Genetics is a big key in this as well. Many times a certain gene is introduced (going forward in the timeline of life) and sometimes it hasn't continued but many times it has stayed. I'm not a scientist, and I'm sure there's stuff I missed, but that's my understanding of it, and the fact that not one single piece of evidence has contradicted the theory of evolution so far.",

Today, more than a half-century after the appearance of that encyclical, some new findings lead us toward the recognition of evolution as more than an hypothesis. In fact it is remarkable that this theory has had progressively greater influence on the spirit of researchers, following a series of discoveries in different scholarly disciplines... The convergence in the results of these independent studies-which was neither planned nor sought-constitutes in itself a significant argument in favor of the theory.\" \n \n \n But I suppose the Pope is going to hell emoticon_rolleyes \n \n Here is a link to a website that has a brief list of translational fossils, there are gaps but that could mean that we have yet to find those fossils, or we have found them but no one has made the link yet.\n \n \n You also keep stating that evolution is theory, we all agree it is still a theory but it is the most plausible theory that fits the evidence found that Evolution is the most likely mechanism to explain that we have lots of different species, to condense it to the real basics just think of it as the ancestry of the species.(Apologies for condensing the Theory into those small sentences could be here forever explaining Evolution :) )\n \n N.B Evolution does not mention how life started, there is another Scientific Theory on the Origin of life on Earth, but I can not think of it at this moment.\n \n Hunter it is really not good form on a message board when debating a subject to say someone is going to hell because they don't agree with your viewpoint, present your evidence why you believe that evolution is incorrect and we can have a proper debate.",

One can only wonder at your thought processes that makes such irrelevant and disconnected thoughts pop up.\n \nBTW, there is more documentation to support the Bible than alleged proof to support the theory that man evolved from nothing.\n\n Actually, I think that lack of support for your mythology is one of the reasons that it isn't accepted as literal. I suspect that your documentation is just assertion that you believe because it tells you what you want to hear.\n \n Why is it that creationists keep claining to have \"proof\" and never present any? Have you checked out the threads in the Religion forum where some posters are having trouble demonstrating the historicity of Jesus? How can you claim documentation for Adam & Eve, the Garden, talking snake, the flood?\n \nIf the evolution theory is correct, who created the first atom. Hmmmmmm!\n\n If evolution theory is correct, who cares? What does cosmology have to do with how life changes? You still seem to lack the integrity to learn even the basics of what you claim to oppose. Wouldn't it be better, if you want to present arguments against evolution, that you actually discuss evolution?\n \nWhy are you so intent on debunking God? Why do you seemingly hate the Creator of your very soul?\n\n What are you talking about. Unless you're god, you're talking nonsense. What I have tried to debunk is your constant ignorant babble about nothing and I have tried to explain why you are not talking about evolutionary theory because you don't know what evolutionary theory is. I haven't attempted to debunk God, only your cultish view of god, and the topic of the Creator of anyone's soul hasn't come up.\n \nWhere are the transitional fossils?\n\n In museums of natural history, mostly. Big_Bear_Scot has referred you to a list of them. But my bet is that you can't even define what a transitional is. You'll go on about half a wing, or half an eye and demonstrate your unwillingness to learn. And then you'll keep on asserting that there are no transitionals no matter how many we show you simply because you don't understand what is being discussed and you have closed your mind so tight that you are incapable of grasping the simple ideas involved.\n \nHow is it that man made the Atomic Bomb in a few years and yet in 150 years evolution is still a theory?\n\n Perhaps you'll be good enough to explain what an unrelated accomplishment of technology has to do with a scientific theory. In fact, the atomic bomb, as well as the operation of nuclear power plants, is the engineering application of nuclear theory. All those bombs and power plants operate according to principles that were predicted by nuclear theory - and it's still only theory.\n \n And it has been explained to you before that in science, a theory is as good as it gets. Theories don't grow up to be facts. When something is raised to the status of a scientific theory it means that there is little doubt that it is correct.\n \nI would like to ask you this question; do you claim to believe in God? Also, do you believe in the possibility of life after death. If you answer no to these questions, do you like really, really hot weather?\n\n A little variation on Pascal's wager? What does that have to do with evolution? Again you demonstrate the hubris of your cult and userp the authority of God. Are you sure that you will be welcomed by your god after having done so?\n \n By the way, if your purpose here is to somehow bring people to your god, I would suggest that your actions are counterproductive. What you are actually doing is revealing the foolishness of your faith. You are an embarrassment to thinking Christians everywhere.",

   "This is not a debate of if I believe in evolution,I already know I do. I was asking people to simply list some of the evidence. I have no doubt in my mind that evolution is the truth. Sorry if it throws anyone off, but that is all I needed.\n\n Well, discussions on the web have a tendency to wander off topic. Especially discussions of religion v. evolution. Those who take the side of religion are usually ignorant of evolution and try to discuss their straw man versions.\n \n But to answer your question, it's not that simple. Here you are, 8th grade I think you said, and you are asking for a few simple paragraphs that will educate you on a topic that I didn't study in ernest until I was a junior in college - that was after I had taken the required coursed in general biology, zoology, botany, and especially genetics. What you are asking can't be done.\n \n But I can point you to a site where you can read about a variety of topics that are relevant - others have already linked pages from the site. It is The Talk.Origins Archive. You could start by reading the FAQ, and possibly some of the articles linked from there. Or you might go \"Browse the Archive\" and then click on \"Must-Read Files\" for a list of articles that cover some basic ideas. For example, 29+ Evidences for Macroevolution presents evidence based on phylogenetics. Or you can select one of the other topics on the \"Browse\" page for articles that pertain to more limited discussions. And finally, you can search the Archive for articles that deal with specific topics. There are articles that answer generally all of the creationist straw man arguements. There are even articles on creationism by creationists. For example, Mr. Kent Hovind's site is linked. Hovind is a particular embarrassment to Christianity because of his profound ignorance of science and his childish views of God and religion, as well as his weird political views.",

   "I guess it will be a while before evolution can be explained simply like a lot of other known sciences.\n\n Now you're being silly. \"A lot of other sciences\" can't be explained simply. My son spent 5 years studying nuclear physics, and that includes several courses of higher math. Even at that, he didn't get into quantum mechanics, which has no simple explanation and isn't even understood completely by experts. On the other hand, the basics of chemistry has been reduced to physics.\n \n Evolutionary theory is quite mature and is the oldest of the basic scientific theories. Newton's theories of motion and gravity have been amended and then amended again. The three statements still haven't been reconciled - each is correct in a particular set of circumstances while none is correct in all cases.\n \n The older a scientific theory gets, the less likely it is that it can be explained \"simply.\" What you ask shows a lack of maturity and naive egotism. It's typical of children your age to think that you know almost every thing and are on the verge of understanding it all. Not so. Even if you were to pick one small subspecialty, you could spend the next 10-12 years studying and still not have gained a comprehensive knowledge. And yet, you want the whole thing explained in a few words in an internet board.\n \n Or maybe you are too lazy to actually put in some effort and do some research at Talk Origins? You expect to be spoon fed everything, at your whim. I guess expecting a little maturity from a 14 year old is a bit much. I tried to help you but I guess that was futile. I'll refrain from trying in the future since I can't learn for you and I'm not willing to try to meet your demands that everything be laid out for you.",

   "Okay, let's look at evolution.\n\n Oh! Goody! At last someone who wants to actually discuss evolution instead of mythology!\n \nBasically, there are two possibilities: (1) The universe predated itself into eternity past (most evolutionists refuse to even talk about this one); or (2) It all started at some point (big bang or something of that sort).\n\n I thought you were going to talk about evolution? What does cosmology have to do with evolutionary theory? Do you actually know what evolution is? If you claim that you oppose something, wouldn't it be better to actually learn at least the basics of what you claim to oppose instead of making yourself look like a fool? The theory of evolution is a theory of biological science having to do with observed changes in living organisms. The theory of evolution does not apply to the origins of the universe, galaxies, stars, solar systems, planets, or even the origen of life. Those are other fields of science.\n \n(Did I get that right? There's not a third, I hope.)\n\n Obviously not. However, most \"evolutionists\" refuse to talk about an eternal, unchanging universe because it has been disproven. Einstein thought so until Hubble and Lema\u00eetre showed him that he was wrong. He included a \"cosmological constant\" in his calculations of general reletivity to make the universe eternal. He admitted that it was the greatest mistake of his scientific career.\n \n Of course there is at least a third hypothesis. A supernatural being created the universe last Thursday with the appearance of history, and created all of the necessary geology, archaeology, and paleontology, as well as history (including all of the books) and memories of all of those living last Thursday. I submit that my \"theory\" of Last Thursdayism is as correct as any theory of creationism. I have as much proof for my view as creationists do for theirs - none.\n \nIf we're to discuss the \"eternity past\" theory, then we're talking about the realm of infinity and that has never been, nor ever will be, proven. Mathematically, it isn't possible.\n\n Again I must ask, what does that nonsense statement have to do with the theories of evolution? How does that apply to observed changes in living organisms over time? Again, why didn't you have the integrity to learn the basics of what you claim to oppose? Are you just another dupe of creationist masters?\n \nIf it all started at some point (as most evolutionists believe), from what did it start?\n\n Yet again we see a demonstration of your ignorance. There is no requirement that an evolutionist must believe that the universe started at a singularity. It may be true that 99% of them do, but it isn't actually relevant to evolutionary theory. Evolutionary theory deals with changes to living organisms over time.\n \n As to the question of the start of the universe, it seems to be consistant with quantum fluctuation. In fact, the spontaneous creation of matter from nothing has been observed. But of course, that has nothing to do with evolution. Only the ignorant claim that it is so.\n \nIt is accepted scientific hyposthesis that matter can neither be created nor destroyed. It can only change state.\n\n I got ahead of you there, didn't I? Actually, you are talking about Newtonian physics, which has been amended twice. In fact, matter seems to spring into existance without cause. It has been observed and measured. It is two steps beyond the Newtonial physics that you cling to.\n \nBased on this, everything tangible that we have today had to have been present at the beginning of time.\n\n An already disproven hypothesis.\n \nThen where did it come from?\n\n It came from a quantum expansion of time and space.\n \nIf it came from nothing, how do you explain that?\n\n Well, scientists in the appropriate fields of science are working on that. I'm not a cosmologist so I rely on scientists in those fields to research those questions. I'm a biologist. I deal with questions of biology, that is living organisms. That is why I am concerned with how living organisms change through time. In other words, that is why I am concerned with evolution. While physicists, cosmologists, geologists and so on may accept evolutionary theory, that doesn't mean that their fields of science are \"evolution.\"\n \nIf I were an evolutionist, I'd much rather tackle the infinity problem.\n\n What are you talking about and what does that have to do with evolution?\n \nEven if you're one of the \"progressive evolutionists\" and claim that God started evolution, then where did God come from? (At some point, this issue requires faith.)\n\n Perhaps you can tell us where God came from. You have spent some considerable effort in arguing that your god is impossible, so where did it come from. Please don't forget to show how your discussion is relevant to evolutionary biology.\n \nYou say evolution has been proven?\n\n Not exactly. It has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\n \nThen prove either one of the two scenarios above. (Or tell me about that third possibility.)\n\n First I want you to explain how your two scenarios are linked to evolutionary theory. Cosmology, astrophysics, astronomy, and even abiogenesis aren't evolutionary theory. Go and learn what you are talking about before you speak. You make yourself look foolish with your arguments against cosmology while claiming that you are arguing against evolution.\n \nYou say evolution has been observed? Then tell me -- who was it that observed the origin or lack thereof?\n\n That's ignorant. Several examples of evolution have already been posted. Fruit flies speciated in the lab. Hawthorn maggot flies speciated to infest first apples, followed by cherries and pears. Those are observed speciation events.\n \n\n You can rattle off all sorts of data (real or imagined).\n\n But you can't. You may imagine it but you can't present evidence that supports your position. You can only argue against what you don't understand in the first place. I generally make it a rule to keep my mouth shut unless I have actually had the integrity to educate myself about the basics of a topic. You don't seem to do the same.\n \nBut until the origin question has been solved, evolution shall forever remain a huge mystery.\n\n I'll tell you just one more time, since you seem to be quite slow. Evolution does not consider the question of origins.",

As to your claim that scientists are getting closer to calling the theory of evolution a fact, it demonstrates that you don't know what a scientific theory is! No theory EVER becomes a fact in science. Theories are proposed to explain facts. Evolution is a fact, it happens and the theory of evolution explains it.\n \n \nThe laws of science are constant. They don't change to suit political agendas. Whatever forces were in existence at the origin (of life, of matter, of energy, etc.) are the same forces that are in play today.\n \n \n This is true, the forces of natural selection, mutation, genetic drift, ect. have been working since life first arose on the earth, this is supported by all available evidence.\n \n \nEvolutionists attempt to make this split strictly because they are unable to justify the beginning.\n \n \n Untrue. Life on earth didn't arise at the begining, it arose 3.8 billion years ago. Evolutionary biologists don't have anything to do with the begining of the universe, they don't study it, they don't care about it, they make no attempt to justify it. However the universe came into being has nothing to do with the natural processes that drive evolution. Once life arose, no matter what it arose from, no matter how the universe came to exist, it evolved, the evidence makes that clear. Please explain WHY evolutionary biologists must explain the begining of the universe, how does it impact the theory of evolution.\n \n \nAnd learning the truth about the origin is necessary if true scientists want to find out how it all works. \n \n \n But biologists don't study the origin of the universe, the forces that were at work, they just don't have any bearing on the theory of evolution. Your assertion of what a true scientist wants is crazy. Does a medical researcher have to learn the truth about the origin of the universe before he developes a new vaccine? Does an oceanographer need the origin of the universe to explain deep sea currents? Does a geologist need the origin of the universe to explain oil field formation? Of course not. \n \n \nGiving it another name (cosmology) does not provide relief for this requirement.\n \n \n Theoretical physicists and astronomers study cosmology not biologists. Your confusion on this issue stems from your lack of understanding of what science is and how it works.",

   "Too bad I can't say the same.\n\n My mistake. I thought you were going to discuss evolution. Instead you revealed your ignorance of cosmology. It is too bad that you clearly can't say the same since you are clearly unequiped to discuss evolution.\n \nOne of the definitions of \"evolution,\" according to Websters New World Dictionary (I thought you'd like to know, especially because heretofore, you didn't.)\n\n Actually, I have known the definition of evolution since I took my first course in evolutionary biology many years ago. That goes along with my courses in genetics, ecology, and the like, that form the basis upon which my degree in biology was granted.\n \n\"Biol. a) the development of a species, organism, or organ from its original or primitive state to its present or specialized state; phylogeny or ontogeny b) DARWINIAN THEORY (see LAMARCKISM, MUTATION)\" [Emphasis added]\n\n Well thanks for that. But what your Little Golden Dictionary says isn't really relevant to what biologists mean when they talk about evolution. That really isn't a very good definition - much too narrow and incorporating a flawed conception of the theory. But I'm sure that you notice that even that flawed definition talks about species, organisms, organs, phylogeny and ontogeny. It further specifies that these things already existed. Only a fool would think that that the definition included the origin of the universe. It doesn't even include the origin of life.\n \nThe ORIGIN has EVERYTHING to do with evolution.\n\n I tried to explain to you before, but if you want to insist on displaying intentional ignorance, go ahead.\n \nWhat I'd like to know is why would you spend the time to do all of that typing when it amounts to nothing more than one long insult?\n\n I was trying to educate you on the basics. But since you lack the integrity to actually learn, I can understand how pointing out your ignorance would seem like an insult to you.\n \nIs that what you think you have to do to win a debate?\n\n There wasn't any debate. You made some statements that are wrong. There is no doubt that you are wrong and that you don't know the slightest thing about the topic. A debate would imply that you were informed about the issues and were able to state why your position is correct. That is obviously not true.\n \nRecent facts surrounding the details of DNA structures have caused evolutionists to alter their thinking about the complexity of life and the things that must happen in order for changes to occur.\n\n And I'm sure that you can adequately explain these facts, what the \"old thinking\" was and how and why it has changed. Please explain what is meant by \"the complexity of life.\" What things must happen in order for changes to occur - you can limit the reply to the new things that must occur since biologists are pretty aware of how and why organisms change according to the \"old thinking,\" i.e., the theory of evolution.\n \nWith each new discovery of this sort comes more questions than answers. In spite of this one step forward -- two steps backward approach, evolutionists are constantly making claims that they are getting closer to calling their \"theory\" a proven fact.\n\n Oh, oh. You have just shown yourself to be just another scientific illiterate. Scientific theories don't grow up to be facts. Unlike \"creation science\" where the conclusion is the starting point and the facts are selectively mined and distorted to point to the conclusion, science starts with facts. The last step is a theory - theory of gravity, germ theory of disease, heliocentric theory, atomic theory, tectonic theory, and of course, evolutionary theory.\n \nThe laws of science are constant.\n\n Since the laws of science are actually statements by humans of observations of nature, they can change as our understanding increases. But there is an assumption made by science that the forces that we see in action today are the same forces that have been in action in the past. Thus, we see erosion and sedimentation going on today and we are sure that similar structures in the earth were created by the same forces. We see animals change today as they adapt to their environment, and we are sure that those sorts of adaptations took place in the past.\n \nThey don't change to suit political agendas.\n\n No they don't. And that is why it is so sad to see the religious right make a political issue of their religion and try to pretend that mythology has a place in science.\n \nWhatever forces were in existence at the origin (of life, of matter, of energy, etc.) are the same forces that are in play today.\n\n Exactly.\n \nEvolutionists attempt to make this split strictly because they are unable to justify the beginning.\n\n Now you're being silly. Evolutionists are biologists. That means that they study living organisms. How the universe formed is unimportant to the observed changes in living organisms. Whether it was the big bang or the big magical skyman makes no difference. Creationists try to lump all science they don't understand or that conflicts with their mythology under the name \"evolution.\"\n \nAnd learning the truth about the origin is necessary if true scientists want to find out how it all works.\n\n That may be true, but no single scientist is capable of learning and understanding all of science. No progress would be made at all. That is why scientists concentrate their studies on only a small specialized field of science. That is why there are astronomers, particle physicists, nuclear physicists, astrophysicists, geneticists, molecular biologists, population geneticists, cytologists, ornithologists, and on and on. But to be a competent ornithologist does not require intimate knowledge of the physics of the big bang. Nevertheless, I suspect that I know more about that topic than you do too.\n \nGiving it another name (cosmology) does not provide relief for this requirement.\n\n And trying to lump all science that conflicts with your mythology based religion does not impose a requirement. Either you can learn what you are talking about or you can continue to make yourself look foolish.",

   "Egads. emoticon_frazzled \n \n I think there's room for both the \"theory\" of evolution and the \"unproven truth\" of the Bible. How about this:\n \n God created all, and man in his own image. But God also gave all living things the ability to change over time -evolution- so as to be successful. Why would He create something doomed to failure? If God indeed knows all/sees all, then He would be aware of design flaws in what He was making. (Believe in God if you want to, or not)\n \n Take humans as an example of evolution. Wait, that's too much. Let's take a look at a couple of body parts and the general appearance of humans, in a very simple example.\n \n Northern Europeans, from a cold climate with less light. Light/white skin, as no protection from harmful UV in sunlight required. Lightly pigmented eyes, same reason. Thin noses, to slow and heat the air in nasal cavities prior to it entering the lungs. Generally large, as a larger form retains heat better than a smaller one.\n \n Central Africans, from a hot climate with much more light. Dark skin, as protection from sunlight required. Eyes also dark for same reason. Wider noses, to allow dispersal of heat. Generally thinner about the hips than northern Europeans, as to not retain as much heat (think wide receiver vs offensive lineman)\n \n Even inside the African continent we can see some genetic diversity (evolution). Take the Masai. They are tall and very thin. Very apt construction for people that live on the plains and are in the sunlight a lot. Thin to minimize exposure to the sun and disperse heat, and tall so with their long strides they can get places more efficiently. Now contrast with the pygmy peoples. They are much shorter than the Masai, and lighter skinned. They live in the thick jungle, where being tall and gangly would be a definite disadvantage; their lack of dark pigment echoes the fact that not as much sunlight reaches the jungle floor. \n \n With these examples I think it is easy to see that there is some sort of force at work.

They said, based on the way it looks now, let's assume that it had been doing the same thing the whole time. This is similar to when a creationist extrapolates the current waning of Earth's magnetic field to say that it can't be billions of years old. It's really the same concept (except there is evidence to contradict the creationists like the alternating polarity along the Atlantic seafloor). For all the cosmologists know, the universe breathes in and out for some unknown reason. The reason for breathing is as well known as the reason for accelerating expansion which has been recently observed. The only explanation the cosmologists can come up with is mysterious dark energy and such. It could be that, or it could be that the whole theory and hence our understanding of the universe is flawed.\n \n The BB is the best explanation out there for all the data (from what I know), but it can't explain certain problems very well at all.

   "Was it that I wasn't clear or that you weren't paying attention. None of that is part of the theory of evolution.\n\n It's that you weren't paying attention and I must not have been clear enough.\n \n I just said what you said, like 3 times and stuff and junk.\n \n I said these things aren't the theory of evolution.\n They are evolution.\n Clear?\n \n \nYou have reduced the word to mean nothing more than change, and that is certainly not the connotation of biological evolution, i.e., the theory of evolution.\n\n \n That's all the word ever means. Change (over time as if you can have any other type of change).\n \n \n \nNo. Because they are wrong and you are wrong to let them. Just because creationists are so sloppy in their understanding of science is no reason that you have to be.\n\n Who's being sloppy?\n If they use the phrase \"theory of evolution\" you have every right to jump down their totally wrong throats. But they don't, they use the word evolution. \n \n Going around saying NOTHING is evolution except biological evolution is what's sloppy.\n \n \n \nCreationists do it so that they can lump anything in science that they don't like under the \"theory of evolution.\"\n\n No, it's so they can lump everything they don't like into something described by a word, evolution. It's evolution of ANYTHING, not just biology, that they oppose. \n \n They know exactly what they are attacking and they call it by its name.\n \n Hey, I'm sure every once an a while they call BB to present the \"theory of evolution\" and they are wrong to do so.\n \n \n \nSo if they talk about stellar evolution, or chemical evolution or anything else, correct them. They will explain to you that it was all Darwin's idea and that it is an effort to reject God and escape punishment. They are wrong and you are wrong to take part in such sloppy pseudoscience.\n\n I doubt they think that Darwin had anything to do with cosmology.\n They can be pretty dense, but give them a little bit of credit.",
