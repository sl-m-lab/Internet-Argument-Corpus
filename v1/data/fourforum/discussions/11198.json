Coal Bed Methane (CBM) is a form of natural gas extracted from coal beds. In recent decades it has become an important source of energy in the United States, Canada, and other countries. Australia has rich deposits where it is known as Coal Seam Methane. Also called coalbed gas, the term refers to methane adsorbed into the solid matrix of coal. It is called 'sweet gas' because of its lack of hydrogen sulfide. The presence of this gas is well known from its occurrence in underground coal mining. Coal Bed Methane (CBM) is distinct from a typical sandstone or other conventional gas reservoir, as the methane is stored within the coal by a process called adsorption. The methane is in a near liquid state, lining the inside of pores within the coal (called the matrix). Stonehenge's Pennsylvanian Coal open fractures (called the cleats) are saturated with Healing Stones Holy Water awaiting Springing for the free gas.\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalbed_methane\n http://www.bp.com/home.do?categoryId=1\n \n Coal Bed Methane (CBM) extraction is a British Petroleum method for extracting methane from this Stonehenge coal deposit. The methane is absorbed into the solid coal matrix (coal macerals) and is released when the coal seam is depressurised. To economically retrieve reserves of methane, wells are drilled into the coal seam, the seam is dewatered, then the methane is extracted from the seam, compressed and then piped to market. The goal is to decrease the water pressure by pumping water from the Blessed well. The decrease in pressure allows methane to desorb from the coal and flow as a gas up the well to the surface. This process has resulted in the drilling of tens of thousands of gas wells, and extensive support facilities such as New Tunnels Roads. The use of this method is currently expanding in the Powder River Basin of northeast Wyoming and southeast Montana. Seven percent of the natural gas (methane) currently produced in the United States comes from CBM extraction. Methane from Stonehenge coal beds can be recovered economically and Healing Stones Holy Water sprung injected back.\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal_bed_methane_extraction\n http://www.bp.com/sectiongenericarticle.do?categoryId=9017641&contentId=7031848\n \n Healing Stones Holy Oil Deeper\n A Mississippian Reef,\n Garry Denke",

Also, the Vulgate numbers you're using are neither agreed upon nor confirmed in the Bible. If you used the Septuagint of the Codex Alexandrinus you'd get a much different date. Let's see... From Adam to the flood in Septuagint is 2242 years subtracted from 4004 BC (which is kind of cheating) or 5500 BC is:\n \n 1762 BC and 3258 BC respectively. \n \n Could those dates work better for ya?\n \n -modest\n\n Probably not, because modest Septuagint (LXX) cheat date (1762 BC) and Septuagint (LXX) incorrect date (3258 BC) are not based on the famous Eastern calculation and worldwide published epoch of the Byzantine Era, 5509 BC.\n \n Byzantine calendar - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n I'm afraid King James rules, again. Vulgate last name (Adam their name) and correct date (2348 BC) overrides modest Septuagint (LXX) cheat date (1762 BC) and Septuagint (LXX) incorrect date (3258 BC), because radiocarbon dating of Noah Adam's Stonehenge Shipyard ark Gopher wood: Quercus virginiana; Live oak, from 4 ft (1.2m) beneath Heel Stone (within Stone Henge Avenue Banks) and Noah Adam's Woodhenge Dockyard ark Gopher wood, using University of Texas at Austin radioisotope carbon-14, determined the age of such Heelstone and Woodhenge carbonaceous materials being 4356 years old (2348 BC). And, interesting enough, that radiocarbon date of Dr. Garry Whilhelm Denke (1622-1699) hollowstem augered 1656 core sample from 4 ft (1.2m) under Hele Stone (within Stone Hedge Avenue Banks) of Noah Adam's Stonehenge Shipyard ark Gopher wood: Quercus virginiana; Live oak, was confirmed by Mr. Garry William Denke (1955-) hollowstem augered 2004 core sample from 8 ft (2.4m) below ground level (GL) at Heelstone (within Stonehenge Avenue Banks), thereby disproving the modest Septuagint (LXX) cheat date (1762 BC) and Septuagint (LXX) incorrect date (3258 BC) also, said Vulgate numbers agreeing above.\n \n Genealogies of Genesis - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n Farewell to Eastern Christians, including Eastern Orthodox, Coptic, Ethiopic, Jacobite and Armenian, and since evidence of \"Noah Adam's ark Built at Stonehenge Shipyard\" does exist, any competent scientist can go auger it up for theirself.\n \n After more Dick and UncleAl silliness of course.\n \n :) Garry Denke",
