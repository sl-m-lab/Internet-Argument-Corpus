   "As an example of the WW technique. The following article proves that mutation and natural selection have nothing to do with evolution and that the neo-lamarkian vitalism approach has to be the truth of the matter. Sure it does.\n \n ==========================================\n \n \n Far-Flung Flowers\n \n By Elizabeth Pennisi\n ScienceNOW Daily News\n 15 June 2007\n Plants lack legs, fins, or wings, but they still get around faster and easier than one might think. A study evaluating the origins of shrubs and herbs on a group of islands in the Arctic Circle finds that seeds arrived from hundreds of kilometers away to restore plant communities lost during the last ice age--all in a matter of a few thousand years. One of the first assessments of rapid, long-distance dispersal, the effort reinforces that plant communities can recover from devastating events. But the findings also mean that seemingly isolated flora are at risk of being replaced by southern species as the climate warms.\n \n During ice ages, glaciers scour and cover large swaths of land, wiping out plant communities for millennia. Yet those communities have returned as ice has receded, and researchers have long debated just how far the new founding populations have traveled. Botanist Inger Greve Alsos, now at the University Centre in Svalbard, Norway, hoped a study of the Svalbard Archipelago would provide a definitive answer. Located between Greenland and Russia, Svalbard experienced a near-complete loss of its vegetation during the last ice age and was quite sparse even 10,000 years ago, but today it is home to a thriving plant community.\n \n With the help of volunteers, Alsos, Christian Brochmann of the University of Oslo, and colleagues collected 4439 samples, representing nine plant species, from more than 500 Arctic populations in Greenland, Russia, Scandinavia, and Svalbard. By analyzing genetic markers called amplified fragment-length polymorphisms, the researchers could tell whether a Svalbard sample had, say, Russian ancestry, because of the many markers shared between that sample and a Russian one.\n \n To the team's surprise, most of the Svalbard species hailed from multiple places--but predominantly from the farthest one, northwestern Russia, more than 1000 kilometers away. The diversity within each species indicated that six to 38 individuals--depending on the species--had to settle in Svalbard for that particular species to become established on the islands, Alsos's team reports today in Science.\n \n The data indicate that plenty of seeds arrived--perhaps on driftwood on sea ice, or else blown there--but that not all these seeds were able to put down roots. Temperature seemed to be the determining factor. About 85% of the high Arctic plants found in Greenland, Russia, and Scandinavia had successfully settled in Svalbard, but only about 50% of species requiring slightly warmer temperatures had.\n \n This foreign invasion is both good news and bad news for Arctic communities. On the one hand, notes Alsos, Arctic species will be able to disperse to new places better suited for them as the climate warms. On the other, current Arctic species are more prone to being displaced, says Richard Abbott, a plant evolutionary biologist at the University of St. Andrews in Fife, U.K. Given how relatively easy it is for seeds to get to Svalbard, \"geographical isolation might not be a very effective barrier\" to invasions by more southern species as the climate heats up, he says.",

   "**\n Time to re-animate this thread. To recap what has been contributed in response to the OP-- 'lesz' & 'chem' first said nothing, merely used words in order to gainsay that the linked article said anything. In sum, they said, \"Wasssssssuppp?\" .\n \n Next, 'chemmy' embarrassed him/her/them self/selves yet again by contributing an article on plant distribution and dispersal, apparently while suffering from the wackadoo pop gen notion that the distribution and dispersal of organisms equates to evolution.\n \n Then unriggable called the thread stupid just because chemmy's posts were.\n \n Then 'chemmy' made him/her/them self/selves look even stupider by trying to caricature the dispersal/distribution of organisms from his/her/their contributed article by claiming that EAM holds that that particular dispersal was deliberately and consciously put into effect by the plants involved. EAM, OTH, actually claims that methods and systems and mechanisms of dispersal and distribution are traits, and that it is the trait, and not its systematic expression, especially in any specified instance, that is developed by EAM. But that's way too complex an understanding for darwinians and other clowns to grasp.\n \n Speaking of which, 'klown' popped by to tell us that he just didn't get it, either.\n \n At this point, 'chemmy' finally plumbed the depths of non sequitur absurdity by asking if the live cells that we call sperm cells were live cells. Duh!!\n \n Unbelievably, he even offered a link to prove to me that something I have always resolutely put forward as fact, was in fact, a fact!! The stupidity was getting so thick that wasn't even funny anymore.\n \n That's when 'shadow' popped in with an ad hom, which is all that shadow's brain can ever muster, even on its very best day.\n \n And lastly 'unrig' told us that he/she still wasn't paying attention, but felt prepared to contribute nonetheless.\n \n Now to the article.\n \n Excerpt--\"Fish, amphibians and even tiny zooplankton do many things to escape hungry enemies, from finding new homes to changing their physical characteristics. Such tactics may save individual lives - but in the long run might leave the population worse off, Michigan State University scientists say. \"\n \n In this first paragraph they challenge the darwinian assumption of congruence between evolved organismic adaptedness and darwinian, population/ reproduction-based, 'fitness'.\n \n The second paragraph says, \"When you introduce a predator into a system ... the potential prey don't sit around and say, `Eat me,'\" fisheries biologist Scott Peacor said. \"They have adapted [themselves] to get out of the way. But that comes at a cost.\" \n \n Note that this is phrased as per EAM, and is the anti-thesis of any darwinian, \"Luckily when the predator showed up the organisms got a lucky genetic mutation which coincidentally translated itself into an adaptive trait that cut down on mortality by this particular predator.\", statement. The reason for this EAM phrasing is that to express this stimulus/response adative phenomenon in darwinian terms is just too silly and ridiculous to sell to the non-darwinist public.\n Here is what the fleas did--\"As the water flea's numbers increased, many daphnia withdrew to deeper, darker waters - apparently having learned to smell their pursuers. The tactic enabled many to survive. But because the water was colder, their community's birth rate plummeted. \n \n Some also grew longer spines, making them harder to eat. But it also slowed them down, hampering their own ability to catch food.\" \n \n \n Next, the article says, \" It also showed that invasive species can cause harmful behavioral changes in their prey even when they've been exposed to each other for relatively short periods, Peacor said. \n \n The same principles likely hold true for other predators, he said. \n \n \"All animals evolve ways to sense predation risk and avoid it, from the (single-cell) paramecium to elephants,\" he said. [Bold added. N<B.,--note:- he says \"animals\", but the word \"organisms\" is equally valid. Ask any plant biologist who studies insect predation, or any microbiologist about bacterial resistance to phage and virus predation.\n The option of moving out of harm's way, the simplest response to predation, and the most wide-spread among animals, is limited where plants are concerned, hence their emphasis upon erecting barriers between themselves and the predator. It is the second favourite response in animals from turtles through porcupines to daphnia. The third, and rarest anti-predation response is usually chemical, from monarch butterflies and milkweeds to skunks and bombardier beetles. After that anti-predation stops being mechanical and becomes social, with herds flocks, schools, swarms, colonies, hives, cultures and societies doing things collectively that mechanical chemistry cannot do, but can only be used as a 'tool' for the doing of them.\n \n But this article was simply concerned with showing the crack between the reality of adaptation to predation and the darwinian assumption that RMNS leads to increased \"fitness\" in 'populations'.",

Such tactics may save individual lives -- but in the long run might leave the population worse off, Michigan State University scientists say.\n \n \"When you introduce a predator into a system ... the potential prey don't sit around and say, 'Eat me,'\" fisheries biologist Scott Peacor said. \"They have adapted to get out of the way. But that comes at a cost.\"\n \n Though the study focused on two particular species in the Great Lakes, it has implications for other predator-prey relationships, Peacor said Thursday.\n \n It also illustrates the complexity of the danger from invasive species, which scientists describe as one of the biggest threats to the lakes' delicate ecological balance. At least 183 such species have been detected in the lakes. Most apparently were carried across the ocean in ballast tanks of freighter ships.\n \n Peacor collaborated with Michigan State doctoral candidate Kevin Pangle and Ora Johannsson of the Great Lakes Laboratory for Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences in Ontario, Canada.\n \n They studied what happened when the spiny water flea, an invasive predator native to Europe and Asia, encroached on locations in lakes Erie and Michigan inhabited by a zooplankton species called daphnia.\n \n As the water flea's numbers increased, many daphnia withdrew to deeper, darker waters -- apparently having learned to smell their pursuers. The tactic enabled many to survive. But because the water was colder, their community's birth rate plummeted.\n \n Some also grew longer spines, making them harder to eat. But it also slowed them down, hampering their own ability to catch food.\n \n The study found that such \"nonlethal\" effects from evading predators could do 10 times more damage to the daphnia population than for some to get eaten.\n \n It also showed that invasive species can cause harmful behavioral changes in their prey even when they've been exposed to each other for relatively short periods, Peacor said.\n \n The same principles likely hold true for other predators, he said.\n \n \"All animals evolve ways to sense predation risk and avoid it, from the (single-cell) paramecium to elephants,\" he said.\n \n Earlier studies documented sharp declines in two other daphnia species after the spiny water flea arrived in the Great Lakes in the 1980s, said David Bunnell, a fisheries biologist with the U.S. Geological Survey's Great Lakes Science Center.\n \n But those studies presumed the only reason was that the water flea was eating daphnia, Bunnell said. The Michigan State team's findings offer an additional explanation: a slower growth rate.\n \n \"Certainly the hypothesis makes sense,\" he said.\n \n Still, Bunnell said there had been no apparent reduction in the type of daphnia that Peacor's group observed. If that happened, it could affect the lakes' food web. The daphnia provides crucial nourishment for juvenile fish such as alewives and smelt that, in turn, are eaten by larger sport fish.\n \n Todd Atwood, a research biologist with the Arizona Game and Fish Department, said the Peacor team's findings about damaging effects from avoiding predators offered insights for his studies of interactions between wolves, cougars and their prey in the West.\n \n When wolves return to an area where they've long been absent, elk spend less time in open spaces -- where they're easier targets -- and more in places with heavier tree growth.\n \n But that leaves the elk less time to forage. And it boosts their exposure to another predator: cougars.\n \n Sponsored Links (ASSOCIATED PRESS\n \n 6:28 a.m. June 15, 2007\n\n \n And thats all you have to work with.

And if a new morphology appears and it becomes established either wiithin the original species or results in reproductive isolation of that specific linage (ie speciation) then the genes of those individuals differ from the bulk of the original population and thus the relative frequencies of genes have changed.

   "By JOHN FLESHER, Associated Press Writer\n (AP) -- It hardly seems fair, but water creatures nimble enough to avoid being gobbled up by predators might harm their species more than help, new research suggests.\n \n Fish, amphibians and even tiny zooplankton do many things to escape hungry enemies, from finding new homes to changing their physical characteristics. Such tactics may save individual lives - but in the long run might leave the population worse off, Michigan State University scientists say.\n \n \"When you introduce a predator into a system ... the potential prey don't sit around and say, `Eat me,'\" fisheries biologist Scott Peacor said. \"They have adapted to get out of the way. But that comes at a cost.\"\n \n Though the study focused on two particular species in the Great Lakes, it has implications for other predator-prey relationships, Peacor said Thursday.\n \n It also illustrates the complexity of the danger from invasive species, which scientists describe as one of the biggest threats to the lakes' delicate ecological balance. At least 183 such species have been detected in the lakes. Most apparently were carried across the ocean in ballast tanks of freighter ships.\n \n Peacor collaborated with Michigan State doctoral candidate Kevin Pangle and Ora Johannsson of the Great Lakes Laboratory for Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences in Ontario, Canada.\n \n They studied what happened when the spiny water flea, an invasive predator native to Europe and Asia, encroached on locations in lakes Erie and Michigan inhabited by a zooplankton species called daphnia.\n \n As the water flea's numbers increased, many daphnia withdrew to deeper, darker waters - apparently having learned to smell their pursuers. The tactic enabled many to survive. But because the water was colder, their community's birth rate plummeted.\n \n Some also grew longer spines, making them harder to eat. But it also slowed them down, hampering their own ability to catch food.\n \n The study found that such \"nonlethal\" effects from evading predators could do 10 times more damage to the daphnia population than for some to get eaten.\n An\n \n Is your original OP by the way. The Daphnia moved to a new habitat to which they were less well adapted. The result was a shrinkage in Daphnia numbers. There is no reference nor implication that this was an evolutionary process. \n NONE.\n \n We have covered the spine growth thing else where, its a response to predator chemicals in the water not a genetic change. And its self catalyizing because once stimulated Daphnia secretes chemical signals which maintain the effect the latching relay model.",

   "If behaviours persist over generations then they are inherited epigenetically and are evolutionary.\n\n \n Nope behaviors can persist over many generations and not be heritable at all either epigenetically or genetically. Midwesterners have long eaten mostly wheat and corn as their staple grains. If mid westerners were raised in Vietnam they would most likely eat rice as their staple grain. The behavior of eating wheat and corn is not heritable and the change to eating rice would not be an example of evolution as its well within the normal behavioral repertoire. \n [QUOTE]\n \n Civilization, for instance, is definitely a case of behavioural evolution in human beings. \n\n \n Perhaps given that its based on the social nature of our species which is at least in part evolved somewhere along the primate linage.

   "**\n \n A bit more teeth-kicking--\n \n \"Best Males Have Less Successful Daughters\n Science Daily - The strongest and fittest of a species might be expected to produce the best offspring, but this is not always the case, researchers at the University have found.\n \n \n Studies of red deer published recently in Nature suggest that the most successful males are more likely to produce less fertile daughters. \n \n Male and female deer need different attributes to succeed. Genes which prove to be an advantage in fathers don't necessarily prove beneficial in daughters. \n \n Males who win fights for females go on to produce daughters who have fewer offspring, whereas the daughters of less successful males demonstrate higher fertility. \n \n The research helps explain why, despite natural selection, there can still be broad biological diversity between individuals in a population. \n \n Dr Loeske Kruuk and Dr Kathi Foerster, of the School of Biological Sciences, and their colleagues conducted a long-term study of a wild population of red deer on Rum, in the Inner Hebrides. \n \n Dr Kruuk says:\n \n \"Natural selection means that the most successful individuals pass on their genes more frequently than the losers, so in the next generation more individuals should be carrying those good genes. As time goes on we should expect the low quality genes to be lost, causing less variation between individuals. \n \n \"But we still see huge differences between individuals in a population. This effect of the best males not producing the best daughters is possibly an important reason why such differences remain. Maybe the idea that some genes are better than others is just too simplistic: it depends on the sex of the individual animal.\"\n \n The research was partly funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC).\n \n Note: This story has been adapted from a news release issued by University Of Edinburgh.\"\n \n Found at \n http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/07/070705095207.htm",

SOP for you. Will you just answer the question?\n \n \nMy reply was that you were just blustering and putting on an act\n\n Yes, it was such a devious act too-provide a link referencing the same article as you, but with more information and quotes from the researchers, and ask you why you thought it was a \"teeth-kicking\". My god, I'm such a drama queen!\n \n \nand that you should perform your histrionics where the audience might appreciate them.\n\n Don't worry WW, your crown is safe. I'm not interested in the position.\n \n \nThat's telling your ham-acting to get lost, not you. You want to make a stab at intelligent, HONEST, debate, you can stick around.\n\n Well, thank you very much for the invitiation. What say we start the \"intelligent, HONEST, debate\" by you answering the questions I asked: \n \n 1.Where exactly was the \"teeth-kicking\" again?\n 2.Where in what I quoted, or in the link I posted, or what I said myself, is it even remotely implied that male and female deer in this study were, or should be, treated as two seperate species?\n 3.Exactly which part is \"pathetic\"?

The original OP cited study on water fleas has expired, but if you skip over the ensuing pure garbage posts by darwinists that did not address it or its negative implications for darwinist \"NS\" and \"Fitness\", but instead focussed on non sequiturs , ad hom attacks, and just generally making a stink, you come to post #16, where I review the thread and that study. In that post I show that organismic response to predation is conscious and volitional, not only wrt changed behaviour ['flee' to unsuitable habitat] but also wrt changed morphology ['fight', as per generating novel spines]. But the point of the thread, as per its title, is how neither of these 'fight' or 'flight' responses conformed to the darwinian notions of \"NS\" and \"Fitness\", since in both responses \"Fitness\" is diminished by the response, as much as it is diminished by the \"Natural Selection\" applied by the predator. As I said then,--\n \"But this article was simply concerned with showing the crack between the reality of adaptation to predation and the darwinian assumption that RMNS leads to increased \"fitness\" in 'populations'.\"\n Which I might better have phrased as, \"This thread is simply concerned with how this study shows the crack/disconnect between the reality of adaptation to predation and the darwinian assumption that RMNS leads to increased \"fitness\" in 'populations'.\"\n \n This post was followed by chemmy getting everything all mixed-up in his head, and going on irrationally for several posts, until, in post #24, he finally asks a sensible question, which I trouble to sensibly answer in post #25.\n After which chemmy raves and rants for 4 successive posts. The upshot of which is that the original point of the thread gets de-railed and takes off in several different directions. I don't mind, in this case, but chemmy's penchant for irrelevancies, strawmen, redherrings, and non sequiturs makes this just about SOP in threads in which he participates.\n \n Posts 35-41 are so moronic that they should embarass any darwinist who reads them. After that the thread deteriorates into the usual schoolboy, \"Let's make ourselve a gang and all attack him!\" slanging match, until I revive its pouint and purpose in post #50, with the article showing \"Natural Selection\" and \"Fitness\" as being opposite and conflicting when applied to the two sexes of one species, the scottish red deer. Wherein the only way to rationalise the conflict and make it harmonise with the darwinian notions of \"Fitness\" and \"Selection\" is to treat the two sexes, or rather, in darwininian terms, their genetic make-up/respective genomes, as if they were two different 'species', i.e., 'genotypes', each with their own genomes evolving as per \"Natural Selection\" and \"Fitness\", but without regard for the fact that they are, in fact the same basic organism.\n \n It is an objection to the standard darwinist notions of evolution that arises repeatedly in nature, wrt regard to sexual differences in morphology and behaviour between male and female within a single species of organism. And all the rationalising, word-invention, and layers of mumbo-jumbo laid on by darwinists simply does not make it go away.\n \n This post was immediately answered with something non sequitur and stupid by slop, and then followed by tq's smoke and mirrors. Whether he is being dishonest, and deliberately obtuse, or simply naturally obtuse, I cannnot tell.\n But my point has been made with sufficient clarity that anyone with an open mind and average intelligence can see it clearly.",

You are your own worst enemy and you are too arrogant to see it.\n\n - without having the courage to reveal the name you use/d in that forum. \n\n 'Courage'?

And it is no lie that you cannot understand or interpret them - you admitted to this at least twice at ARN. \n Not to mention the fact that it is opretty clear that you cannot form the things you write and your laughably naive interpretations of dumbed-down press releases and the like. Let's face it - you do not link to actual scientific papers, or very rarely do. You link to and cut and paste press releases and the like.\n Do you deny that? Look at the post opening this very thread - a link to physorg.com, a 'press release' web site.\n\n \n That I do not, and never have, pretended to the details of molecular biology or the arithmetic of population genetics does not make me incapable of determining the factual material empirically observed in scientific studies, nor from interpreting those facts theoretically, nor from critiquing the interpretations that darwinists lend to the facts on the basis of their ideology.\n\n Actually, if that is the subject of the discussion, which it often is, it does.\n If you do not/cannot understand the technical details, then you are almost certainly missing the main points. Look at your laughable antics on the Delbruck-Luria paper at ARN - I used to read that thread daily for the entertainment value. First you complained that you didn't have the paper. Then a link (actually, several) was provided, and you complained because nobody would cut and paste the entire paper for you!

Pointing out that you wrote much of the same gibberish on another forum and acted like.. well, the way you do here on another forum is not 'revealing' anything, though I suspect that might be why you chose to use a different name on here...\n\n \n then it is cowardly to repeatedly make those negative references, especially when they are false and/or distorted, without revealing the name he himself used on that site. An anonymous slanderer is a coward. In my case, that's you, bub.\n \n\n I am no coward, and your labeling me as such is just another instance of your own probable .... 'issues.' Anonymous - Not to mention the fact that as I link to my blog - whereon one can find my name (that you have used on here for apparently an attempt to intimidate me or something from your mom's basement...) I am much less 'anonymous' than someone that uses the moniker 'Wascally Wabbit'.\n\n **\n I can comprehend what you wrote on your blog as self-description. If that stuff isn't true, that's your fault, and nothing to do with me.\n\n Interesting, since I wrote nothing about my place of employment on my blog.\n IN your laughable attempt to, I don't know - insult me I guess, you wrote:\n \n \"assistant biology teacher in some some small Vermont college\"\n \n The link to my profile contains this information:\n \n Gender: Male \n Industry: Education \n Occupation: Associate Professor of Biology \n Location: north east : United States \n \n \n So who is the liar?\n \n Make that, who is the DOCUMENTED liar?\n \n My blog profile says nothing about my age, it says that I am an associate professor (not teacher - supposed to be an insult, I suppose) and that I live in the north east US. \n \n You cannot even make up stuff very well.\n\n **\n That is a lie. I said, wrt specific papers, that those particular papers were impenetrable. That gives you no right to claim that I said that I cannot understand or interpret scientific papers generally. That is a lie.\n\n \n That you wrote that you cannot understand specific papers - papers relevant to issues that YOU had brought up - does not bode well for your general understanding of scientific papers on technical issues that you have already admitted you have no education in. I have a right to claim whatever I want, especially if the preponderance of evidence, even if it is circumstantial, supports my position.\n \n It is true that you almost always link to and cut and paste news releases and the like. It is also true that when actual papers are presented to you, you cannot comprehend them or make excuses for why you should not have to read them. It is also true that you have a habit of insisting on using dictionary defintions for scientific terms and/or defining terms to your liking and insisting that they must be used the way you want them to be used. Is that not also correct? I know, I know, another 'lie'...\n\n \n \n Added to which, if a paper is so arcane and abstruse that it needs a phd in some gnostic sect of 'science' to be able to parse out its 'meaning', then it is just rubbish anyway. See Occam's Razor.\n\n Occam's razor does not apply to internet malcontents that think they know more than they do. But that is funny - if you cannot understand it, it must be rubbish. WHO is the arrogant dogmatist, WW? \n**\n HAW!! Tell ya what, scotty. The above sentence in unintelligible, but if what I posted, including what you insult the rest of us by calling, \"dumbed-down press releases\", as well as the original papers I've consistantly posted over the years, was so \"laughably naive\", I wouldn't have been able to use it to show you and your pals up for the self-important dogmatists and ideologues that you are, and you people wouldn't hate me like poison the way you do.\n\n \n IN your little fantasy world, you may think you have done this. But the fact is, the only people that I am aware of that give your naive claims any merit are Bertha Jane vandeGrift, a person with no college education, who at one time was a proud young earth creationist, a person who rejected evolution because of her distrust of the pharmaceutical industry, and a few clowns at ARN and ISCID, a collection of anti-evolution zealots that have also given merit to the claims of John Davison, Christopher Langdon, Peter Borgher - in fact, the only criterion they appear to have to give merit to claims like yours is that it must be anti-darwinian.\n \n I don't hate you, I think you are troubled.\n\n \n You guys seriously dislike me only because I constantly succeed in punching holes in your inflated egoes, and worse, do that so effortlessly.\n\n Megalomania.\n \n Look into it.\n \n You've done nothing to my ego, or anyone elses' from what I have seen. And from the frequent misinterpretation of even press releases you exhibit, I am not at all worried that you will somehow discover some amazing anti-darwinian issue... that someone else actually did the research on...\n\n **\n And your problem with that is, exactly?!? This is public debating forum, a philosophy debating forum, open to anyone and any factual material that backs up their arguments. Neither the participants nor their opininions nor their supporting material need some kind of 'pedigree' in order to be admitted here. So keep your notions of intellectual elitism on the basis of diplomas and technical papers to yourself.\n\n The 'problem with that exactly' is that most folks realize that press releases and the like only tell part of the story, and the part they tell is often somewhat sensationalized. Look at your intellectual compatriot Supersport and his debacle on caterpiller coloration - he claimed that an article he linked to was trouble for darwinism because it reported on 'evolution' without mutations. Problem was, that is not what the article really said (though the title was misleading, I will say) and when I went to the original scientific articles, it in fact stated quite clearly that a mutation has involved.\n \n So, THAT is, exactly what is wrong with extrapolating and drawing conclusions from press releases.\n\n \n Maybe you'll wake up to the fact that we are not a professional group gathered in erudite in-house conference to settle some local disagreement on some point of scientific interest. If you want that, go back to the faculty lounge. \n\n We don't have a faculty lounge, and I know it is just a discussion forum. Which is fine. But some are apparently not here to 'discuss', rather to try to - what was it? - bruise people's egos and the like.\n\n **\n That is another lie. I complained that the person debating me was trying to pull the old darwinist trick of 'debating by proxy', wherebye a top-lofty pedant instructs his/her opponent to go back to school or to the library, there to learn from a book. article, study, or website, just why their opinion is wrong and the pompous git (who is either too lazy or too stupid or too ignorant to actually make his own argument, there and in person), is right.\n \n\n It is not a lie at all - tell us all, did you ever actually read the paper? I mean, it WAS the subject of the discussion. And it really is pretty straight forward and simple to understand, providing you have the appropriate background. And it is true that if a person wants to discuss the content of a paper that they cannot understand, then they might want to reconsider jumping into the discussion until they learn enough to actually, you know, discuss it. That is not pedantry or elitism or snobbery. It is pure arrogance to insist that one CAN discuss the technical issues of a field of science without actually being able to understand the very technical papers that contribute to the foundation of the field!\n\n \n I complained that arguments are to be made by the debater, only using cut 'n paste material in short citations in order to back up, (and only as support for), that debater's own arguments. Simply supplying a link, or even posting an entire paper, when not done simply as a matter of information-sharing, (which is fine), but rather, as it was in that case, as a substitute for an argued presentaion of opinion on a certain issue, is not fine.\n In fact, it stinks, and I've complained about the practice on every board I've been on, including this one.\n \n\n \n I'm sure - you have a reputation for complaining, despite your own behavior. As one of the mods at ARN wrote, of all the complaints he received, about half were from you and the other half were about you.\n \n But I digress - the hypocrisy is astounding, when one considers the OP of this very thread...\n\n \n **\n Apart from the fact that you are again taking the cowardly liberty of misrepresenting to the readers of this forum something that took place some time ago on another bulletin board entirely, in order to personally attack and insult me while remaining secret about what you then called yourself and what you contributed to that thread, there is nothing \"amazing\" about me describing my interpretation of \"L&D'43\" in a debate about \"L&D'43\". \n\n Oh, sorry - I did not take part in those discussions. I am not a member at ARN, I only lurk there on occasion. So I was not involved in those discussions, I only was entertained by them.\n *ADDED IN EDIT*\n Ah - I found a saved web page from ARN. Look at this interesting exchange:\n \n\n \nBut what test has proven Random mutations are the sole source of Biological Diversity? \nConsider the Luria-Delbruck experiment.\n**\n Gee, john, still trotting out that 62 year old piece of ignorance, are you? No matter how many times I show you where Luria and delbruck went completely wrong, you keep on insisting that their outdated assumptions still apply in the face opf all we've learned about bacteria in these past two decades. Well, you gets marks for stubborness, I suppose.\n \n\n The person responding to 'john'? Why, none other than mturner, who just appeared to admit that he could not actually understand the L&D 43 paper! So, how could he have shown where they went wrong if he coul dnoit understand the paper????\n \n Inquiring minds want to know....\n \n \n \n\n \n What is amazing is that you think it amazing that anyone would take your tired, out-dated, and ignorant old experiment, and the conclusions that darwinists ever since have leapt to on the springboard of its 'post hoc, ergo propter hoc' assumptions of spontaneous, magical, genetic generation.\n \n\n \n Your projection is astounding. Yeah, I guess those old papers by that guy Newton and pals are just old nonsense and must be replaced by the truly insightful but strangley unsupported second-hand claims of internet malcontents.\n\n \n \n **\n Haw! You're the \"angry little man\" who came to this board in order to carry over his bitter spite from ARN, and vent his poisonous lying spleen on this board. Not me, bub.\n \n\n Um, actually, I have been registered here since 2003.\n You can't even seem to get your pathetic attempts at character assassination right.\n\n **\n Now you are so pompously preposterous and self-important that you make a laughingstock of yourself. It's amazing that your silly ego doesn't explode like a child's balloon.\n \n Ego seems so important to you. The narcissist usually is very concerned about ego, I suppose.\n **\n**\n Right back atcha, chumley.\n\n Thats funny because I have never set myself up as a genius. Unlike those who have no knowledge, background, education, experience, or training in the sciences - those that tend to inhabit anti-evolution internet discussion boards - I have never claimed to be able to knock down egos or overturn dogma or such fantastic feats.\n \n No, unlike the true liars, the true cowards, I know my limitations.",

Instead you, as a materialist. etc., believe that all organisms, yourself included, are passive collections of inanimate particles that need a direct action taken upon them by some external agency [such as a random genetic mutagen, or internal entropy] before they or their circumstances can be changed-- for them. This new, dynamic, systemic understanding of life and biological evolution really blows your mind.

Which is why I no longer refer to myself as an IDist. Moreover, the number of right-wing wack-jobs on that site were polluting my political philosophy by association. The upshot being that I said things that got me banned.

Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, & Systematics 38:53-77. ABSTRACT. Our understanding of the social lives of microbes has been revolutionized over the past 20 years. It used to be assumed that bacteria and other microorganisms lived relatively independent unicellular lives, without the cooperative behaviors that have provoked so much interest in mammals, birds, and insects. However, a rapidly expanding body of research has completely overturned this idea, showing that microbes indulge in a variety of social behaviors involving complex systems of cooperation, communication, and synchronization. Work in this area has already provided some elegant experimental tests of social evolutionary theory, demonstrating the importance of factors such as relatedness, kin discrimination, competition, between relatives, and punishment. Our aim here is to review these social behaviors, emphasizing the unique opportunities they offer for testing existing existing evolutionary theory, as well as ...\"\n \n If they aren't talking 'microbial psychology', then what are they taliking about?

Restistance to antibiotics is often simply the mutation of an existing enzyme so that it can bind and metabolize the antibiotic, OR a mutation in which binding to the site of action is negated, or where the target becomes inaccessable physically to the antibiotic because a pump mutates to push the antibiotic out of the cell.\n \n A bacterial cell no more mounts an immune response to an antibiotic than a cancer cell does towards a drug. So far as I know (and I know but little) immune responses are multicellular and found in multicellular organisms as a mechanism of distinguishing non-self from self.\n \n And of course in humans the humoral immune response relies on priming by external antigens to shift the \"population genetics\" of the B cells to different clonal lines. In effect natural selection at the cellular level within the organisms own confines. Just to head off WW there is no psychology involved, there is no intent involved, it proceeds by relatively well understood activation of the relevant clones by the relevant antigens. \n \n In any case I really think WW is out of his depth in basic biology.",

   "Consider the Huxley-Wilberforce debate:\n \n http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/thuxley.html\n \n \nAs the nickname \"Darwin's bulldog\" would suggest, Huxley was an outspoken defender and advocate for Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. Perhaps surprisingly, he was at first an opponent of any evolutionary change at all, believing that the living world had stayed much the same for as far back as its history could be traced, and that modern taxa would eventually be found in the oldest rocks. But he came to accept evolutionary views: his reaction to reading the Origin of Species was \"How stupid of me not to have thought of that.\"\n \n He is best known for his famous debate in June 1860, at the British Association meeting at Oxford. His opponent, Archbishop Samuel Wilberforce, was not-so-affectionately known as \"Soapy Sam\" for his renowned slipperiness in debate. Wilberforce was coached against Huxley by Richard Owen. During the debate, Archbishop Wilberforce ridiculed evolution and asked Huxley whether he was descended from an ape on his grandmother's side or his grandfather's. Accounts vary as to exactly what happened next, but according to one telling of the story, Huxley muttered \"The Lord hath delivered him into my hands,\" and then rose to give a brilliant defense of Darwin's theory, concluding with the rejoinder, \"I would rather be the offspring of two apes than be a man and afraid to face the truth.\" Huxley's own retelling of the tale was a little different, and quite a bit less dramatic:\n \n If then, said I, the question is put to me would I rather have a miserable ape for a grandfather or a man highly endowed by nature and possessed of great means of influence & yet who employs these faculties & that influence for the mere purpose of introducing ridicule into a grave scientific discussion, I unhesitatingly affirm my preference for the ape. \n \n All accounts agree that Huxley trounced Wilberforce in the debate, defending evolution as the best explanation yet advanced for species diversity.\n",

   "Ah good so you know more precisely than I what I meant when I said that antibiotic resistance is not an immune response. \n\n \n Oh, of course. I suppopse that I can see how an uneducated layman might conflate antibiotic resistence with immunity, but it seems irrational for someone claiming to understand this material to do so.\n\n Restistance to antibiotics is often simply the mutation of an existing enzyme so that it can bind and metabolize the antibiotic, OR a mutation in which binding to the site of action is negated, or where the target becomes inaccessable physically to the antibiotic because a pump mutates to push the antibiotic out of the cell.\n\n \n Yup.\n\n \n A bacterial cell no more mounts an immune response to an antibiotic than a cancer cell does towards a drug. So far as I know (and I know but little) immune responses are multicellular and found in multicellular organisms as a mechanism of distinguishing non-self from self.\nExactly correct. Immunity is the acquisition of cells with antigen specific recptors (memory cells) after an immune response. The response itself involves several different cell types as well as numerous cytokine secretions, etc. A single bacterium simply lacks the ability to do any of that.\n\n \n And of course in humans the humoral immune response relies on priming by external antigens to shift the \"population genetics\" of the B cells to different clonal lines. In effect natural selection at the cellular level within the organisms own confines. Just to head off WW there is no psychology involved, there is no intent involved, it proceeds by relatively well understood activation of the relevant clones by the relevant antigens. \n \n In any case I really think WW is out of his depth in basic biology.\n\n Most certainly, but to recognize and discuss this is seen as 'ad hominem' or worse.

And I quote--\n \" Yes indeed the entire set of interactions between organisms is mediated by chemical interactions. Its not pshchology(sic) its(sic) just chemistry and evolution.\"\n Whatever it is that he thinks that gibberish means.\n \n\n I suppose he knows what he meant, as do you when you write your actual unintelligible gibberish. Of course, he is right. Other than flowery, unwarranted overinterpretations of laymen and the employment of anthropocentric metaphorical and descriptive language by overenthusiastic researchers, there is no actual evidence that there is any sort of molecular/cellular \"intelligence\" in the way that the term is generally used. The things you link and cut and paste - in addition to being simplified press-release type articles - use these terms for simplicity. A bacterium is not 'deciding' to 'warn' its colony-brethren when it encounters a particular stressor, it is simply responding to the stressor and secreting some compound which other bacteria can bind and/or respond to themselves. The fact that, as you and Bertha Jane have written repeatedly, there is no guarantee of success and the results of your EAM-fantasy are not really distinguishable from a random process indicates that EAM and your anti-reductionist views are just idiosyncratic misinterpretations. \n\n Quote:\n I mean, you have already demonstrated that you did not read my blog bio, despite claiming you did... \n\n **\n Another ridiculous slander. And so stupid, since I could not have gotten the info any place else. If it wasn't up to date when I read it, that would be no-one's fault but your own.\n\n Well, here's thing - I have already linked to and cut and pasted the information that is ACTUALLY available at my blog bio, and compared it to what you actually wrote. What you wrote contains additional and different information from that which is actually available at the source you claimed to have retrieved it from. I will, again, demonstrate.\n \n YOU had written:\n \"You still tell those lies, and that tells all the world what they need to know about a middle-aged assistant biology teacher in some some small Vermont college, by the name of Scott Page, or derwood, or SLP, or slop. \"I replied:\n I am not an assistant biology teacher - apparently your powers of comprehension are as low as they ever were. \n You retorted:\n \"I can comprehend what you wrote on your blog as self-description.\"\n And yet, my blog bio contains the following information:\n \n Gender: Male \n Industry: Education \n Occupation: Associate Professor of Biology \n Location: north east : United States \n \n \n So to sum up:\n \n Mike Turner claims that I am a \"middle-aged assistant biology teacher\" at a \"small Vermont college\".\n \n He claims to have gleaned that information from my blog profile. Yet my blog profile does not mention my age; does not say what state I am in; does not state what college I work at; does indicate that I am an associate professor of biology, not an 'assistant teacher.'\n \n I point this out, and yet agin, that paragon of virtue and civility and integrity, Mike Turner, spews that it is a \"ridiculous slander\" and that he could not have gotten the information anywhere else.\n \n But he did not get it where he claims. My profile has NEVER stated the exact state I live in; has NEVER stated my age; has NEVER stated anything about where I work; and was updated to indicate my status as associate professor last summer.\n \n So, who is the ridiculous slanderer? I will let the reader conclude for themselves...\n\n Well, I found the article whose abstract you cut and pasted and claimed could not find a link for (it took all of about 2 minutes). \n\n **\n So bully for you!! Bet that gave your poor starving ego a big lift! Funny how good people get at something that they do every day for a living, isn't it? \n\n \n Yes, it is so difficult to cut and paste an author's name into a publicly available search engine and press \"enter.\" It makes me feel so much more important than the lazy, underinformed, ignorant, yet overconfident malcontents that one so often encounters on the internet.\nQuote:\n It covers the things you highlight, and the authors do not declare it to be 'arguably the most important microbiological discovery of the last 50 years'. and in fact the paper contains this: \n\n **\n Another LIE!! I never said that they said any such thing! It was I who said that, they didn't; but you are so crooked that you never miss a trick, do you?\n\n \n \n You see, Mike Turner, grown ups sometimes draw conclusions from what people claim. Sometimes, grown ups will use quotes and comparisons and counterpoints to prove points.\n \n Yes, Mike Turner, I KNOW that the authors did not write that your unwarranted interpretation of phenomena like quorum sensing is 'arguably the most important microbiological discovery of the last 50 years', and that it was YOU that wrote that. I quoted it and then actually quoted from their article to indicate that such a conclusion is hyperbolic and unwarranted premised on what the authors DID write.\n \n Can you see that now? Good, good...\n\n Quote:\n This raises the question as to whether QS in microbes is truly a cooperative behavior (Diggle et al. 2007, Keller & Surette 2006, Redfield 2002). Are QS molecules true signals? The fact that a compound produced by cell A elicits a response in cell B does not necessarily mean that there is signaling between the cells; it may represent cell B using the molecule as an environmental cue to guide future action, or it may represent cell A coercing cell B into a certain behavior \n\n **\n Can everyone here say, \"Quote mining?!?\". You know every cheat there is, and use them without shame, Scott Page.\n\n Well, Mike Turner aka mturner from ARN and Internet Infidels , surely a scholar like yourelf can demonstrate how it was a \"quote mine.\" Do you know what a quote mining is? It appears that you do not, or, more liklely, are employing one of your famous idiosyncratic definitions that you so often prefer. I did not misrepresent the inent of the authors. I did not present the quote to suggest that the authors believe something they do not. I presented a simple statement of fact from the paper (which you probably did not read and almost certainly did not understand) to indicate that the notions that you espouse as \"'arguably the most important microbiological discovery of the last 50 years\" are not as rock-solid as you pretend they are.\n\n My opinion of her is far more valid than Mike Turner's opinion of her, since I am able to adequately judge her work as opposed to an ideolgically driven undereducated malcontent is. \n\n **\n First, I have my own university degrees[pl.]. Not that that matters, but I am far from \"undereducated\"\n\n You are when it comes to the sciences, especially biology. As a biologist with more than one university degree, I know this since it is my actual field.\nand when it comes down to philosophy and debates over ideological positions, such as is the focus of this 'darwinian atheism vs mythological creationism' debating forum, my academic credentials would top yours, I'm sure. If you have any at all.\n\n Philosophical debates are undertaken when the participant has no credible evidence supportive of their position. You pretend to be discussing biology, then retreat to labeling it philosophy etc. when confronted with facts and reality, and, as most self-important egomaniacs do, declare that your actual background is more important in this context.\n I admit, unlike you are able to do in terms of biology, that I have no qualifications in philosophy other than an undergraduate course in philosophy and logic. But you do not discuss philosophy or ideology until your 'science' is revealed to be at best overinterpreted. It is a simplistic antic, one often undertaken by folks pontificating in areas in which they are under-prepared\n who are unable, psychologically, to admit to being incorrect. One often sees this sort of thing in creationists with engineering backgrounds, but we also see it in anti-materialists with philosophy backgrounds, or so it appears.\n \n So tell us all, Mike, with your university degrees in philosophy and the like - how does constantly labeling opponants as liars and projecting one's own shortcomings upon them indicate the superiority of the arguer's position?\n\n \n And just what in the world is it that you suppose me to be \"malcontent\" about?!?! Sometimes you and chemmy and your lot get truly hysterical.\n\n \n Pretty simple - the world does not agree with you. Discussion board participants do not bow down in awe at your every utterance. This displeases you.\n\n And why should the opinion of an ideologically driven, over-indoctrinated, finally-promoted[sic] malcontent make you the accredited authority on Mae Wan Ho? \n\n What is my ideology? Are you like the internet creationists that have psychic abilities that allow them to 'know' things that have never been revealed?\n What does \"finally-promoted\" mean? I already explained why I think my opinion of Ho's work is more credible than yours, I guess you just ignore or cannot comprehend things that are unfavorable to you.\n\n Aside from your own bloated ego, that is? I'll let people make up their own minds after they google her material.\n\n I wish more people would. They would see that she doesn't really do much science any more, and is on an anti-genetic engineering crusade. And they would see that the adulation heaped upon her by a handfull of internet miscreants is misguided at best. As for my bloated ego, well, I am not the one declaring that everyone that does not agree with me is just an indoctinated ideologue that cannot see the 'truth.'\n \n Am I?\n\n Quote:\n Perhaps, Mike Turner, you could provide a single example of me engaging in insults or self-aggrandizements? \n\n **\n ROTFLMAO!!!\n \n\n Concession accepted.\n \n By the way - pointing out the truth about your tactics and history is not an insult. If you find it insulting, then perhaps you should change your ways.\n\n Quote:\n Keep in mind that descriptions and conclusions are not insults. \n\n **\n Don't be stupid. Both 'descriptions' and 'conclusions' can be nothing but insulting, and in your hands, that's about all that they ever are.\n\n Like I said - if you find depictions of your past and present behavior and intellectual abilities insulting then perhaps you should seek to change youself.\n\n Quote:\n \n Your calling me things like 'scotty' and 'slop' are true demonstrations of your intellectual stature and psyche. \n\n **\n This from the coward who brought his spite to this board in order to attack me,\n As has been proven, I was at this board for 3 years before you came here.\n as he thought, by revealing my name,\n I did not reveal your name until you revealed mine, plus, you have used your real name such as on the laughably naive 'essay' at ISCID.\n and taunting me about what I had said under that user name in a different debating site,\n It was and is essentially the same things - certainly the same style - that you have written here. As I have explained, I was 'warning' the other posters not to get involved as I have seen you in action before. And, as it turns out, I was certainly not the only one ot recognize you.\n\n all the while keeping his own user name from that sight[sic] a craven secret, so that I could not respond in kind.\n\n As I have already explained, I did not take part in any of the threads that I referred to from ARN. That you keep forgetting that - or purposefully ignoring it - indicates the true level of discourse you engage in. YOu want to pontificate and insult, not discuss anything. And how would you have responded in kind, had I taken part? \n\n If you don't like being called \"scotty\", scott, that's just too bad. As for 'slop', slp, it's a natural fit, especially for someone who takes impertinent liberties with other people's names. \n\n Sure, I probably have done so, Mikey. Difference is, I know when to quit.\n\n Quote:\n Keep it up - you make the job of exposing your underinformed, layman's gibberish easier.\n**\n That being the case, how come you are making such an incompetent hash of the job, Mr. Professional Scientist?!?\n \n\n Your inability to recognize your limitations or when you have been refuted is not a reflection on my abilities.\n\n Quote:\n Not to mention your continued projection. This is textbook stuff... \n\n **\n You start talking 'psychology' \"textbook stuff\", pally, and you're way off your turf.\n\n \n Am I? Is it your turf? If not, how would you even know?\n Of course, when you talk evolution, biology, etc., you are way off your turf, but you are too self-important to be able to acknowledge it. Pure Dunning-Kruger.\n\n Quote:\n Perhaps you can demonstrate where I have ever voiced/written such an opinion [this opinion: As opposed to your wackadoo opinion that everything that induces physical/ chemical operations in an organism is that chemistry/physics itself. ]? It would appear that you are just busily manafacturing nonsense again. \n\n **\n It's there in everything you've ever said about biology in this forum, and I could probably find even more at ARN if I knew what user name you employ there.\n\n If that is my opinion, why is it 'wackadoo'? Because you do not like it? Because it goes against your metaphysical ideology? \n And for the third time, I am not registered at ARN and have not been for many many years. One can, as you apparently do not understand, actually READ the discussions there without taking part.\n\n \n I don't have to manufacture your nonsense--you manufacture it every time you open your mouth.\n \n\n \n Wow, that was a clever retort!\n \n I cannot wait to read the latest link or cut and paste of a press release that, darn it, just proves EAM or 'kicks Darwin in the teerth' yet again!!!\n \n emoticon_xagree",

And you know that I have not the least respect for your ideologically self-serving semantics.\n\n \n Right - I forgot that people with backgrounds in philosophy get to define terms and describe biological phenomena. Silly me.\n\n Quote:\n I teach immunology, and it is truly impossible for a single cell to engage in one, but I think it will be interesting to see the contortions and spinning that mike turner will engage in - not to mention the insults - to try to support this naive and ridiculous claim. \n\n **\n Sad that even in some US high schools, private schools, and small local colleges, teacher's still haven't caught up to the fact that bacteria do not operate as 'single cells', but as large eusocial organisms--colonies. See my links to James A. Shapiro, earlier post, above.\n Which of Shapiro's papers refers to any of this - that bacteria are not single cells? A big list might be impressive to Bertvan, but I find it silly. Of course, a bacterial colony is made up of individual bacteria, and does not become a colony until there are sufficient bacteria produced to make it one. As an entire colony of bacteria - eusocial or otherwise - does not develop resistence, rather, it is individual bacteria that do, then it seems that even eusocial colonies operate under hit-or-miss, random changes to single organisms. Some plan... \n\n And to have one of these teachers here bragging about his antiquated understanding of his own field is downright depressing.\n My own field is not microbiology. But I am capable, unlike philosophy majors, of understanding and legitimately interpreting actual scientific papers. And I have seen none which indicate that an entire colony of bacteria have the ability to adapt to its environment without the abilities iniating in individual bacteria who then undergo binary fission to replace the colony members who have died because they were unable to adapt.\n\n Quote:\n I explained that I did not take part in that thread, merely read it, as anyone can do if they had wanted to. I archived the thread for pure entertainment value. I find it funny how you launch into your multiple insults. I can guarantee that you would not be so 'brave' in other circumstances. \n\n **\n Really? You can \"guarantee\" your assumption about me? \n Yes.\nJust how do you propose to do that, you insinuating poser? So far you are the proven coward here.\n\n You have proven nothing, excpet perhaps that you operate in a fantasy world. I have proven that each of your claims, those concerning me and any issue that I have decided to reply to anyway, are false. But I do travel on occasion, and would love to meet you sometime. I have a feeling, however, that something would suddenly come up... as seems to happen when 'tough guy' internet blowhards have their challenges taken up (see the antics of 'Davescot' and 'JoeGallien') .\nQuote:\n You aren't, you know, stalking me are you? \n \n**\n Says the very stalker who stalked me here from ARN. Duh!!\n\n \n Yes, duh.\n \n Gee, I guess I must have stalked you from the future. Your intellect knows no bounds, just as your integrity and your civility and your bravery.",
