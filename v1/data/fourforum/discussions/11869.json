   "Sadly, many people, especially Liberals want to try and marginalize those of us who are Social Conservatives.\n \n Read on:\n \n RealClearPolitics - Articles - Social Conservatives Were Right, Again \n \n \n Social Conservatives Were Right, Again\n By Dennis Byrne\n \n \nThe number of the tributes in the mainstream media to dads over the Father's Day weekend was stunning, something that no one would have believed a decade ago. \n \n Even liberal columnists were praising fathers, their own included, when not long ago it was a matter of progressive conviction to either ignore or ridicule the importance of fathers.\n \n Even black columnists recently have been uttering the unthinkable, that the absence of fathers in the lives of African-American children has had a devastating impact of the social, psychological, economic and moral well being of their families. God bless them for having the courage to stand against same charges of racism that rained down on lonely social conservatives who were making the same point years ago.\n \n They were only reflecting the conclusions of scientific research of the type provided by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who found, for example, that first graders without fathers in the home had an IQ 7.5 percent lower than those with fathers. Moynihan's academic and liberal credentials didn't inoculate him from the rage of progressives overcome by ideology. He was taken to the woodshed by the liberal Nation magazine and the liberal National Council of Churches. President Johnson caved into liberal pressure and excluded the question of family stability and the Moynihan Report from a White House conference on poverty. \n \n Instead, \"quality integrated education\" and equal rights dominated the discussion, and an opportune moment in history was missed to stem, if not reverse, the tide of fatherlessness that today is one of the main causes of poverty, despair and other \"dysfunctions.\" Yet, progressives take no heat, and no apologies issue from them, for this unconscionable exclusion.\n \n For years, anyone who dared discuss in public what social science was continuing to reaffirm--the centrality of fatherhood--were bashed for \"blaming the victim,\" for denigrating \"single mothers,\" and for conducting a host of other \"mean-spirited\" attacks on the poor and minorities.\n\n \n =snip=\n \n \nNo more shying away. No more excuses about how \"I'm a fiscal conservative, but a social moderate.\" No more fear of being identified with the \"Christian right\" or others who hold the same views for religious or moral reasons. All those reasons are good, but scientific, secular reasons for holding these same views are fact-based and sound. Social conservatives have every reason to be proud of what they have accomplished and confident of what they still will achieve.\n \n Dennis Byrne is a Chicago Tribune op-ed columnist and freelance writer.

That hardly equates to social conservatism as something that should be practiced. Merely because it got something right doesn't mean it is entirely right. If I applied that logic to liberalism, you'd be forced to accept it, you won't though because you have serious double standard issues.",

   "Sadly Bassman, the american nuclear family is dying and the cause of it can be laid at the doorstep of women like Gloria Steinem and organizations like NOW (National Organization of Women). I remember when the ERA was adopted by the Senate in 1972 and thought it was wonderful that women would now receive equal pay for equal work. I actually said to friends over beers that night that maybe now men and women can get along now and this female fascist war against men will end. \n \n Little did I know that it was only the beginning and over the next 30 years the ratification process would never succeed. So women's rights organizations would continue to demand not equality with men but superiority over them in all aspects of our social makeup. Two generations of women were raised to believe they don't need men, that unless they have a career, they aren't fulfilling their destiny's as females. Forget stay at home motherhood, that's for the downtrodden and oppressed. \n \n So today we have latchkey kids raising themselves in broken homes while mom is working 2 jobs, and these kids turn to the internet for advice they should be getting from their parents. And their dad is living 30 miles away and they wont see him until friday, hopefully. \n \n I get little solace from an article that has the courage to finally state that dads matter 30 years after the fact and once the damage has been done and irreparable harm has been inflicted on enough generations so that being raised in broken homes is now seen as normal in this Country. The article rightfully lays the blame for this so called social reform/cancer at the doorstep of the far left, just as the current moral depravity that exists is also the Left's gift to our morally bankrupt society.\n \n Don't get me wrong; equal rights, equal treatment and equal opportunity for all people is a righteous goal for any society. But balance and a rational perspective is also key to an ordered and symbiotic existence but sadly feminism never built that quality or goal into their agenda. So everybody suffers from the broken homes which this radical feminist movement created. And like your article said, no apologies, no remorse, no regrets from them. After all, the leaders of this movement got everything they wanted. Why worry about the women they left in the dust to live in the squalor and despair which is the result of their failed ideology. emoticon_cry",

   "Nobody denies that, given a free choice, a home with two loving parents is better than a home with just one. Where liberals and conservatives differ is that conservatives think that children are better off in a home where the parents argue all the time or where one beats up the other, that the biological relationship between parent and child is more important than the love and care shown by that parent. Conservatives HAVE vilified single mothers, when they work for \"abandoning\" their kids and when they don't for \"scrounging\". They think a father is the solution, regardless of whether that father is capable of being a good parent or not.

Prove, and I quote you, that: conservatives think that children are better off in a home where the parents argue all the time or where one beats up the other, Have you ever heard of couples who love and respect each other actually working out disagreements with love and sensitivity? That is what conservatives endorse. \n \n A loveless marriage does nobody any good. But here's an idea, how about if people actually understand the concept of a sacrificial love before getting married? The problem is that people today, and this applies to both conservatives and liberals, are raised in such an atmosphere of, and a focus on satisfying the physical rather than their emotional or spiritual needs, that when it comes to sharing their lives with another person, they are completely unprepared for the give and take which is necessary to create a successful union between a man and a woman.\n \n So that is the basic difference between what liberals and conservatives represent Jo. The secular humanist culture of the left has sucked all moral sense of responsibility out of our society through this corrupted pop culture which conservatives have been condemned for as bigots and control freaks as we have fought against the moral dumbing down of our society from the beginning. And then you have the nerve to attempt to blame us for preferring the dysfunctional families which exist due to your sides contributions to our failing society. Go figure huh! emoticon_rolleyes",

   "It's more that I grew up under successive Conservative governments intent on demonising single mothers. I'm not saying that Conservatives consciously set out with malevolent intent, only that it is how their policies appear and what effect they have.\n \n Liberals didn't corrupt people away from marriages built on mutual respect, give and take and sharing of responsibility - they have rarely existed. For far too many people marriages were forced by social pressure and maintained by custom and chauvinism. I think the divorce rate is too high and people don't work at marriage the way they could and should do, but people necessarily have those skills, and lecturing or castigating them isn't going to make those skills miraculously appear. I think marriage needs to be accompanied by more rigorous preparation. My wife and I had a full day of preparation with a group of other couples getting married soon, and I had a pretty severe grilling from my Dad (a priest) on why we wanted to get married. We've not had any major problems but it's early days (4.5 years and no kids yet) and I think more preparation and advice would be valuable to couples looking to marry, and possibly also as part of ante-natal classes for how to deal with common issues arising from a new baby.",

Go figure huh! emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n Moral sense of responsibility? So it's liberals who are at fault for the divorce rate? It is liberals who are at fault for over 50% of marriages ending in divorce? And your saying that because it is not another episode of leave it to beaver in america that thats the reason why there are broken homes...\n \n I'll tell you why there are broken homes Archie. Drugs, violence, fear, hate, control just to name a few. You see all you do is point the blame of the problem. Liberals at least attempt to slove the problem or to help those who have been affected by such.\n \n And to be honest Archie the world has never been perfect. The world will never be perfect. And you dilusional sense of \"morals\" wont save the world! It wont hide your kids from the fact that life is harsh cruel and unforgiving.\n \n Instead of sayng well if we taught this in school or if everyone went to church or if everyone did this.. Why dont you help those who are victims of this? Because like most of those like you, you will point and blame and JUDGE those who's lifestyles are different from yours.. But you wont judge YOURSELF. Look in he mirror Archie and see that despite all your sense of morals and high thinking and religion, your just as vulnerable to life just as guilty and just as human as the rest of us.

   "I'd actually say that liberals are partially at fault for the rise in divorce. The increasing sentiments that it is acceptable to get out of an abusive, loveless marriage is partially at fault. Prior in our more socially conservative days (the days where husbands could legally rape their wives), divorce wasn't acceptable even if one party wanted out and another was abusive. So the liberal idea that it is okay to get out of a marriage that isn't good for either party is partially at fault. \n \n Interestingly enough, divorce is alarmingly high in the many of the more socially conservative states. \n \n Divorce Rates by State, 1990?2005 &mdash; Infoplease.com\n \n Alaska in 2005 was at 5.8 per 1,000 people.
