   "Can anybody here give me some titles of books that are about the current state of the US economy and the events that have lead up to it?\n Most of the information I get right now are from websites, but most of them are only a couple of pages and I'm getting tired of googling 20+ websites to get a good read.\n \n If at all possible I'd also like a few titles which make comparisons between the US and European economies since IMO Europe is now heading (albeit very slowly) towards the way the US economy is right now (High labour costs, loss of manufacturing jobs, high social security costs, aging working population. Though thankfully the ECB doesn't hold nearly as much power as the Fed, nor is our foreign debt as high as that of the US).",

I took a look at it on Amazon, reviews here:\n \n http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/customer-reviews/1859844839/ref=dp_nav_0/102-9957563-1033758?%5Fencoding=UTF8&n=283155&s=books. \n \n From the reviews he seems more reporter than economist, valuable in that 500 pure economists will have 500 different opinions and a kajillion models focused on pet theories and whatever's paying the bills. With your market experience, you should have no problem with this one.",
