   "Saakashvili declared war not only to opposition striving for his resignation but also to minority groups trying to join people's indignation and civil disobedience! I think that Saakashvili hopes to dilute Georgian opposition by prevention of Georgian population from rural and mountainous areas joining the opposition forces.\n It's well-known that those districts populated by ethnic Armenians and Azerbaijanis who are the main part of Georgian minority groups. And of course officials' using of administrative recourses against timid minority groups keeps them silent actually. These minority peoples have no technical possibility to address for remedial organizations! Under the treat of losing grounds Georgian police could drive minority groups by stick for a long time. Unfortunately it appears that civil war and insubordination to authority will be the last means able to depose tyrant Saakashvili !",
