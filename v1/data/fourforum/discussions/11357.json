   "Let me open a discussion and get some opinion about some firearm restrictions I am familiar with. The following constitutes the majority of the firearm restrictions scheme in my home state of Virginia. I want to ask three questions to anyone who is interested:\n \n 1. Does anyone think any of the following will not survive the SCOTUS ruling in Heller if challenged?\n 2. Does anyone think these laws &#8220;go too far&#8221; and think one or more should be repealed?\n 3. Does anyone think these laws &#8220;don&#8217;t go far enough&#8221; and have additional restrictions they would like to propose? \n \n ( Note that these are not the only statutes in Va, and each of these has exceptions for possession. Punishments are explained at the end)\n \n 18.2-308: Carry concealed without a permit: class 1 misd for 1st off, class 6 felony for 2nd off, class 5 felony for 3rd or subsequent offense. This statute also sets forth the process for obtaining a CCW permit. Va is a \"shall issue\" state and the permit \"shall\" be issued if certain requirements, that can include training, are met.\n \n 18.2-308.1: Carry on school property: class 6 felony, and if weapon is displayed in a threatening manner (whether or not a shot is fired) then mandatory 5 year sentence which cannot be suspended.\n \n 18.2-308.1:1 Purchase, possession or transportation by persons found not guilty of a crime by reason of insanity: class 1 misd.\n \n 18.2-308.1:2 Purchase, possession, or transportation by persons adjudicated legally incompetent or mentally incapacitated: class 1 misd. \n \n 18.2-308.1:3. Purchase, possession or transportation of firearm by persons involuntarily admitted or ordered to outpatient treatment: class 1 misd (mental health treatment)\n \n NOTE: prior to this year the CCRE record check contained no information about mental health commitments. Although it remained illegal to sell or give guns to such persons, the record check was worthless in this regard. The push to include mental health commitments in the CCRE record database to prevent such persons from buying guns was fought by those who were concerned about the privacy of these private medical records. This all changed after the shooting a Va. Tech, and now the State Police (who run the background check system) have access to these records to prevent these purchases. \n \n \u00a7 18.2-308.1:4. Purchase or transportation of firearm by persons subject to protective orders: class 1 misd and if a CCW holder, the protective order revokes the CCW permit.\n \n 18.2-308.1:5. Purchase or transportation of firearm by persons convicted of certain (misdemeanor) drug offenses prohibited: class 1 misd.

Possession or transportation of firearms, stun weapons, explosives or concealed weapons by convicted felons. Notice this is broader than just firearms. If the felony conviction is non violent and more than 10 years old, then class 6 felony. If the felony conviction is non violent and less than 10 years old, then class 6 felony with mandatory 2 years that cannot be suspended. If the felony conviction was for a crime of violence (examples: murder, rape, robbery, malicious wounding, burglary) than class 6 felony with mandatory 5 year sentence which cannot be suspended. Also same punishment applies if the felon possesses just ammunition. \n \n 18.2-308.4. Possession of firearms while in possession of certain controlled substances. Class 6 felony with mandatory 2 year sentence which cannot be suspended to possess any firearm while also possessing certain dangerous drugs (including cocaine, oxycodone, methamphetamine, heroin, methadone) Class 6 felony with mandatory 5 year sentence which cannot be suspended for possession of a firearm and possession with the intent to sell or distribute the above drugs or while possessing with the intent to distribute more than 1lb. of marijuana.\n \n 18.2-308.2:01. Possession or transportation of certain firearms by certain persons (legal and illegal aliens). Class 6 felony for possession of any firearm by an illegal alien. Class 6 felony for possession of an &#8220;assault firearm&#8221; by legal aliens.\n \n 18.2-308.7. Possession or transportation of certain firearms by persons under the age of 18.

This statute also sets forth the process for obtaining a CCW permit.\n \n Probably will stay the same. No change.\n \n 18.2-308.1: Carry on school property: class 6 felony, and if weapon is displayed in a threatening manner (whether or not a shot is fired) then mandatory 5 year sentence which cannot be suspended.\n \n Same as above though I think someone who is CCW holder should carry anywhere they want. There is no point to CCW if they can't. I can understand though, restrictions in court houses, places of that nature, but schools? No.\n \n 18.2-308.1:1 Purchase, possession or transportation by persons found not guilty of a crime by reason of insanity: class 1 misd.\n \n Will not be affected.\n \n 18.2-308.1:2 Purchase, possession, or transportation by persons adjudicated legally incompetent or mentally incapacitated: class 1 misd. \n \n Same as above\n \n 18.2-308.1:3. Purchase, possession or transportation of firearm by persons involuntarily admitted or ordered to outpatient treatment: class 1 misd (mental health treatment)\n \n Same as above\n \n NOTE: prior to this year the CCRE record check contained no information about mental health commitments.

The push to include mental health commitments in the CCRE record database to prevent such persons from buying guns was fought by those who were concerned about the privacy of these private medical records. This all changed after the shooting a Va. Tech, and now the State Police (who run the background check system) have access to these records to prevent these purchases. \n \n You know that's my problem. Yes I can understand there might be some privacy issues, but if this person is a danger to themselves & others, the safety of themselves & others should take precedent. \n \n \u00a7 18.2-308.1:4. Purchase or transportation of firearm by persons subject to protective orders: class 1 misd and if a CCW holder, the protective order revokes the CCW permit.\n \n Won't change much, but would like to see some kind of restrictions on this. I can't remember how many times here (I live in CA) people have abused this. Anyone cant get a RO here in CA. It's ridiculous and this needs to stop. Like I said they should really fix this.\n \n 18.2-308.1:5. Purchase or transportation of firearm by persons convicted of certain (misdemeanor) drug offenses prohibited: class 1 misd. Persons who have 2 or more convictions for illegal possession of marijuana or any controlled prescription drug in a 36 month period are prohibited from possessing a firearm for 5 years after the last drug possession conviction.\n \n Won't Change.\n \n 18.2-308.2.

Possession or transportation of certain firearms by certain persons (legal and illegal aliens). Class 6 felony for possession of any firearm by an illegal alien. Class 6 felony for possession of an \"assault firearm\" by legal aliens.\n \n I'm a bit confused on this one. Is it illegal in VA to transport an \"assault firearm\" if you are a legal resident? If it is, that's ridiculous.\n \n 18.2-308.7. Possession or transportation of certain firearms by persons under the age of 18. Class 1 misd for under 18 year old to possess any handgun or \"assault firearm.\"\n \n \"assault firearm\" means any center fire rifle or handgun with a magazine capacity of 20 or more rounds, or which has a folding stock or which is manufactured to accept a silencer.

Use of machine gun for aggressive purpose. - Unlawful possession or use of a machine gun for an offensive or aggressive purpose is hereby declared to be a Class 4 felony. (class 2 felony if used in a crime of violence) (Note there is a presumption that possession of an unregistered machine gun means possession for offensive or aggressive use)\n \n 18.2-300. Possession or use of \"sawed-off\" shotgun or rifle. Class 2 felony for use in a crime of violence, class 4 felony for simple possession. \"sawed off shotgun\" means any shotgun with a barrel length less than 18 in. \"sawed off rifle\" means any rifle of any caliber with a either a barrel length of less than 16in. or an overall (stock to muzzle) length of less than 26in. \n \n 18.2-279 shooting at any occupied building or an unoccupied school.
