Such courage and what a demonstration of the dishonesty in his 'convictions'. emoticon_xagree\n\n \n No Doc, it's just a sign of his flight from me.\n \n This is the way Brady deals with a direct challenge. When you challenge him to stand by what he says he abandons the thread he was challenged in and starts a new one. This time he had to go back into the time machine to find something \"new\" to post as a distraction.\n \n At least he deserves praise for being consistent. The only variable is how long he waits before he sneaks back to start another thread-pretending that either the challenge in the other thread never happened or that he somehow missed seeing it. Sometimes he waits months, and sometimes he feels it necessary to provide a more immediate distraction. \n \n The challenge is still there, Brady.\n \n In specific answer to his new thread, however, let me say that constitutional law is a subject that proves every bit as difficult for him as history does. The concepts of the presumption of innocence and the 5th. amendment right to indictment by grand jury before trial of one suspected of a felony offense continue to elude him (as they also continue to do in his \"criminals in the gun industry\" thread). \n \n It is possible that he does fully grasp these concepts and that his refusal to apply them here is part of an intelligent but purely Machiavellian outlook whereby he believes the end of gun control is served by denying a citizen these other, equally important rights-but the smart money is wagered on his simple lack of comprehension of the issues involved. \n \n Are you willing to debate me on this new topic you have chosen, Brady?",

   "Bryan,\n \n I fouund the Grand Jury decision suprising given Mr. Horn wasn't protecting his own property, nevermind that both perps were shot in the back.\n \n from the Texas penal code:\n \n Sec. 9.41. PROTECTION OF ONE'S OWN PROPERTY. (a) A person in lawful possession of land or tangible, movable property is justified in using force against another when and to the degree the actor reasonably believes the force is immediately necessary to prevent or terminate the other's trespass on the land or unlawful interference with the property.\n (b) A person unlawfully dispossessed of land or tangible, movable property by another is justified in using force against the other when and to the degree the actor reasonably believes the force is immediately necessary to reenter the land or recover the property if the actor uses the force immediately or in fresh pursuit after the dispossession and:\n (1) the actor reasonably believes the other had no claim of right when he dispossessed the actor; or\n (2) the other accomplished the dispossession by using force, threat, or fraud against the actor.\n \n \n Sec. 9.42. DEADLY FORCE TO PROTECT PROPERTY. A person is justified in using deadly force against another to protect land or tangible, movable property:\n \n (1) if he would be justified in using force against the other under Section 9.41; and\n \n (2) when and to the degree he reasonably believes the deadly force is immediately necessary:\n (A) to prevent the other's imminent commission of arson, burglary, robbery, aggravated robbery, theft during the nighttime, or criminal mischief during the nighttime; or\n (B) to prevent the other who is fleeing immediately after committing burglary, robbery, aggravated robbery, or theft during the nighttime from escaping with the property; and\n \n (3) he reasonably believes that:\n (A) the land or property cannot be protected or recovered by any other means; or\n (B) the use of force other than deadly force to protect or recover the land or property would expose the actor or another to a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury.\n \n ...that's Texas for you.\n\n \n Now see, this is how you have a debate/discussion. Are you watching this, Brady? You're welcome to join in....I've never seen the Texas code cited here before, but I can make an attempt at interpreting it-and assuming it is accurate I will try and compare it to the law of my state. \n \n The three Texas statutes reference each other, and taken as a whole it looks like these statutes could very easily provide a grand jury with a basis for refusing to indict Mr. Horn. \n \n We start with 9.41, and the language I would focus as relevant to the facts presented in Mr. Horn's case is: \n \n A person unlawfully dispossessed of...tangible, movable property by another is justified in using force against the other when and to the degree the actor reasonably believes the force is immediately necessary to...recover the property if the actor uses the force immediately or in fresh pursuit after the dispossession and: (1) the actor reasonably believes the other had no claim of right when he dispossessed the actor.\n \n I read this to say-You catch someone in the act of stealing your stuff, then Texas says you can use force to try and recover it \"to the degree\" you \"reasonably believe\" is \"immediately necessary\" to recover the property. Using deadly force is covered in 9.42 (and this is where it parts company with the law of my state).\n \n The language I think important to Mr. Horn's situation from 9.42 is:\n \n A person is justified in using deadly force against another to protect...tangible, movable property (1) if he would be justified in using force against the other under Section 9.41; and...(2) when and to the degree he reasonably believes the deadly force is immediately necessary: (A) to prevent the other's imminent commission of burglary...or theft during the nighttime or (B) to prevent the other who is fleeing immediately after committing burglary or theft during the nighttime from escaping with the property; and (3) he reasonably believes that: (A) the land or property cannot be protected or recovered by any other means.\n \n The key question here is whether \"he reasonably believes the deadly force is immediately necessary\" to prevent the theft or recover the property. Interestingly enough, the fact that a deputy happened to be in a position to possibly thwart the alleged thieves is irrelevant unless you could show Mr. Horn knew he was there and knew he was able to stop them without Mr. Horn shooting them.\n \n The language I think relevant to Mr. Horn's case from 9.43 is: \n \n A person is justified in using...deadly force against another to protect...tangible, movable property of a third person if, under the circumstances as he reasonably believes them to be, the actor would be justified under Section...9.42 in using force or deadly force to protect his own land or property and: (1) the actor reasonably believes the unlawful interference constitutes attempted or consummated theft of...tangible, movable property.\n \n I read 9.43 to say if you reasonably believe the crime you are trying to stop involves theft of another's property, then you can defend the property as if it were your own under the same terms and conditions as those listed in 9.42.\n \n Sinjin, with this in mind I can see how a grand jury would refuse to indict Mr. Horn-particularly where he was allegedly open and honest about what he did. A lot also depends on whether the jury members (and law enforcement) are sympathetic to your cause. Doc makes a good point when he says people look closely at whether you have tampered with the scene or the evidence. Doing so is as good as an admission that you believe you did something wrong, and it causes people to become suspicion of you and makes them want to question every part of your version of what really happened.\n \n And remember, we don't necessarily have all the facts. We have only those the media (as repeated by Brady) gives us. \n \n This Texas right to defend property with deadly force is far beyond anything my state authorizes. As a comparison, this is how my state deals with the \"castle doctrine\":\n \n The use of deadly force to prevent threatened harm to property is never justified except in defense of habitation. . . .[the remainder of this quote comes from a footnote to the preceding sentence] The use of deadly force, in defense of \"property\" can also be justifiable, but the classic formulation lists only arson or burglary as crimes against property which can justify the use of deadly force. . . . Even then the use of deadly force must have been necessary. Defense of habitation and justifiable self-defense overlap in the \"castle doctrine\" which states that one may, without retreating, use force, to include deadly force if necessary, to keep aggressors out of his own house. This part of the castle doctrine is one aspect of defense of habitation. . . . [T]he justification exists in the curtilage as well as the castle. Roger D. Groot, Criminal Offenses and Defenses in Virginia 114 (3rd ed. 1994). Alexander v. Commonwealth, 28 Va. App. 771, 780, 508 S.E.2d 912, ___ (1999). (the word \"Curtilage\" refers essentially to your yard.)\n \n My state does not permit the use of deadly force to defend personal property from theft. Nor does it permit even a threat of using deadly force to defend personal property (for example, you come out of a store and see a man trying to break you're your car. The law in my state does not permit you to go up to him, pull out your gun, and threaten to shoot him causing him to run away. In Virginia, this would be a crime). The justification for these rules is explained this way:\n \n Even if [the] actions [of the person threatening the defendant's property] were unwarranted or illegal, the defendant, as an owner of personal property, did not have the right to assert or defend his possessory rights thereto by the use of deadly force. In Montgomery v. Commonwealth, 98 Va. 840, 842-43, 36 S.E. 371, 372 (1900), we said:\n The law is clearly stated by a learned judge in State v. Morgan, 3 Ired. 186, 38 Am. Dec. 714, as follows: \"When it is said that a man may rightfully use as much force as is necessary for the protection of his person and property, it should be recollected that this rule is subject to this most important modification, that he shall not, except in extreme cases, endanger human life or do great bodily harm. It is not every right of person, and still less of property, that can lawfully be asserted, or every wrong that may rightfully be redressed by extreme remedies. There is a recklessness and a wanton disregard of humanity and social duty in taking or endeavoring to take, the life of a fellow-being, in order to save one's self from a comparatively slight wrong, which is essentially wicked, and the law abhors. You may not kill, because you cannot otherwise effect your object, although the object sought to be effected is right. You can only kill to save life or limb, or prevent a great crime, or to accomplish a necessary public duty.\" See, also, 1 Bishop on New C. L., secs. 839, 841, 850.\n However, the defendant contends, and the Court of Appeals held, that these principles do not apply when there is a mere threat to use deadly force in protection of personal property. We do not agree. Moreover, the owner of land has no right to assault a mere trespasser with a deadly weapon. Montgomery, 98 Va. at 844, 36 S.E. at 373. For these reasons, we agree with the trial court that a deadly weapon may not be brandished solely in defense of personal property. Commonwealth v. Alexander, 260 Va. 238, 242, 531 S.E.2d 567, ___ (2000).\n \n So there you have it. If the laws cited from Texas are accurate, then they represent a big departure from the old common law practiced in my state. \n I think this is what you were trying to get at, Brady. And that's democracy in action. One man's \"grass roots supported common sense legislation\" is another man's \"product of a corrupt lobbying effort that successfully overwhelmed the better judgment of the people's representatives.\"\n \n All I can say, Brady, is if you don't like it then either work to tell the people of Texas they are wrong and need to change it-or just stay the heck out of Texas.",

   "Looking at Brady's New York elevator scenario I found the following statutes which appear to be New York's law of self-defense which would apply to these facts: \n \n \u00a7 35.25 Justification; use of physical force to prevent or terminate\n larceny or criminal mischief.\n A person may use physical force, other than deadly physical force,\n upon another person when and to the extent that he or she reasonably\n believes such to be necessary to prevent or terminate what he or she\n reasonably believes to be the commission or attempted commission by such other person of larceny or of criminal mischief with respect to property other than premises.\n \n \u00a7 35.15 Justification; use of physical force in defense of a person.\n 1. A person may, subject to the provisions of subdivision two, use\n physical force upon another person when and to the extent he or she\n reasonably believes such to be necessary to defend himself, herself or a\n third person from what he or she reasonably believes to be the use or\n imminent use of unlawful physical force by such other person, unless:\n (a) The latter's conduct was provoked by the actor with intent to\n cause physical injury to another person; or\n (b) The actor was the initial aggressor; except that in such case the\n use of physical force is nevertheless justifiable if the actor has\n withdrawn from the encounter and effectively communicated such\n withdrawal to such other person but the latter persists in continuing\n the incident by the use or threatened imminent use of unlawful physical\n force; or\n (c) The physical force involved is the product of a combat by\n agreement not specifically authorized by law.\n 2. A person may not use deadly physical force upon another person\n under circumstances specified in subdivision one unless:\n (a) The actor reasonably believes that such other person is using or\n about to use deadly physical force. Even in such case, however, the\n actor may not use deadly physical force if he or she knows that with\n complete personal safety, to oneself and others he or she may avoid the\n necessity of so doing by retreating; except that the actor is under no\n duty to retreat if he or she is:\n (i) in his or her dwelling and not the initial aggressor; or\n (ii) a police officer or peace officer or a person assisting a police\n officer or a peace officer at the latter's direction, acting pursuant to\n section 35.30; or\n (b) He or she reasonably believes that such other person is committing\n or attempting to commit a kidnapping, forcible rape, forcible criminal\n sexual act or robbery; or\n (c) He or she reasonably believes that such other person is committing\n or attempting to commit a burglary, and the circumstances are such that\n the use of deadly physical force is authorized by subdivision three of\n section 35.20.\n \n Clearly NY does not permit the use of deadly force to defend property. I don't know if New York permits the threat of deadly force to prevent theft. We don't know if there are other facts to this case which were not included in Brady's post. We also don't know whether law enforcement viewed this as an attempt to defend only property or a mixed case of defense of both self and property. If it was viewed as only defense of property, and if NY does not allow the threat to use or display of a weapon to protect property, then Mr. Campbell could have possibly been charged with this crime:\n \n \u00a7 120.14 Menacing in the second degree.\n A person is guilty of menacing in the second degree when:\n 1. He or she intentionally places or attempts to place another person\n in reasonable fear of physical injury, serious physical injury or death\n by displaying a deadly weapon, dangerous instrument or what appears to\n be a pistol, revolver, rifle, shotgun, machine gun or other firearm.... Menacing in the second degree is a class A misdemeanor.\n \n And consider also this potential crime which would not apply to Mr. Campbell but is noteworthy for its self-defense exception:\n \n \u00a7 265.35 Prohibited use of weapons.\n Any person who, otherwise than in self defense or in the discharge\n of official duty, (a) wilfully discharges any species of firearms,\n air-gun or other weapon, or throws any other deadly missile, either in a\n public place, or in any place where there is any person to be endangered\n thereby, or, in Putnam county, within one-quarter mile of any occupied\n school building other than under supervised instruction by properly\n authorized instructors although no injury to any person ensues; (b)\n intentionally, without malice, points or aims any firearm or any other\n gun, the propelling force of which is gunpowder, at or toward any other\n person; (c) discharges, without injury to any other person, firearms or\n any other guns, the propelling force of which is gunpowder, while\n intentionally without malice, aimed at or toward any person; or (d)\n maims or injures any other person by the discharge of any firearm or any\n other gun, the propelling force of which is gunpowder, pointed or aimed\n intentionally, but without malice, at any such person, is guilty of a\n class A misdemeanor.\n \n I don't know anything else about the situation other than what has been posted here. But apparently law enforcement decided that Mr. Campbell's drawing and display of the firearm was either justified or of such a manner as to preclude successfully prosecution. If the story is correct then they instead decided to charge him only with possession of the gun without a license.\n \n Could it be the decision was \"you had every right to use the gun but you still needed to get a license to carry it before you exercised the right\"?\n \n Oh, and to go back to the Texas incident...I re-read what Brady posted. Brady, what facts do you point to which suggest Mr. Horn shot the two men (whatever their race was) because he was motivated by racial bias?\n \n Very good, Brady! You can move a debate along after all. Let me know when this new found fortitude manifests an ability to discuss things with me. I'd much rather talk to you than at you.",
