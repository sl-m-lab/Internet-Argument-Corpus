   "For all the comparisons that could be made about gay rights and the civil rights fights of the 50s and 60s, one major factor is missing. NONVIOLENCE! Martin Luther King, Jr., C.O.R.E, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and others were at the forefront of the fight and all of them preached nonviolence as the method of choice. It was a choice as they chose peace. It was understood that more hate would not stop hate.\n \n Gay rights activists today could get peace with Church folks if they made the choice for nonviolence, civil disobedience and peace but instead many have chosen violence which anti-gay religious groups will use against us to show that \"gays are violent\". Everyone looses when violence is used. How I could get this message around the USA to every homo out there so they choose nonviolence, learn nonviolence, and protest in nonviolent ways? Someone please tell me.\n \n Sadly, this counter protest in Mass. was a perfect example. Pro-gay marriage groups yelled at church protesters, called them names, and disrupted their rally.

Groups like Mass Equality are not helping the struggle for rights when they make people hate us more.

Instead those people left hating gays even more. Those anti-gay protesters are now more threatened by gays than before the protest. Everyone lost in this event. In violence, everyone loses.\n \n If they had chosen nonviolence, this all would be different. There are 100 more reasons to choose peace for every one reason to use violence.

MassEquality is not helping us, they are hurting us this this type of protest. They should try peace, try nonviolence, they should hand out educational papers to opposing protesters. They should bring the anti-gay people coffee, offer to sit with them and talk, learn from each other instead of calling people \"bigots\". If you want change, you must be the change. If you want people to stop calling you evil things, then you need to do the same. You want respect, you must show respect.\n \n \n \"The aftermath of violence is bitterness.

Have you spent any time with this anti gay crowd? I have. I live in a small town of 20000 and there are over 100 bible beating churches here. They do not want to change, they think we are sick and that only Jesus can cure us. There is no changing a persons mind when they believe their God is telling them to hate us. Only by standing up to them and demanding that they stop are we going to move forward. You may not see this. I understand your point but you can not get them to respect your rights by turning over and begging. What happened with stonewall? Gay people stood up and said no more. There is another way you can break the cycle by discrediting their religious beliefs and making them look like crazy superstitious fools.",

Only by standing up to them and demanding that they stop are we going to move forward.\n\n By the same token Matthew, when you \"stand up to them and demand that they stop\", do they ever stop?\n \n The \"education\" doesn't come to those who are hard-line anti-gay. I agree with you that they can never change.\n The \"education\" comes to those who still have an open mind on the issue. Studies show that those who actually KNOW a gay person are less likely to be against gay equality than those who do not know a gay person.\n \n Please. Re-read that sentence and soak it in.\n Education is a powerful tool for those who are willing to learn.\n The unwillingness for some to learn should not stop us from educating those who are ready to listen.\n \n And if all they \"learn\" is that gays are just as loud and just as obnoxious as those who are against gays, then we are teaching them the wrong message.\n \n \n \nThere is another way you can break the cycle by discrediting their religious beliefs and making them look like crazy superstitious fools.\n\n Your very first statement in your post: \"Joe they don't want to be educated.\"\n So obviously, you realize that \"breaking the cycle\" is not going to occur with the anti-gay.\n So who exactly are you going to \"break the cycle with\"?\n And do you really think that this \"cycle\" will be broken just by shouting louder?\n \n Who accomplished more? Martin Luther King or the Black Panthers?\n Do you understand why?\n So many lessons in history, and you're unwilling to learn them...",
