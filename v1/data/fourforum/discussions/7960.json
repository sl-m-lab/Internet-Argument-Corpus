   "I was long thinking and came to a conclusion that it is neither the very country itself nor democratic developments that the US was aiming at when supported Saakashvili's coming to office in Georgia. The Pentagon has long decided for itself that Saakashvili would be the best person to finish Georgian economy and social networks that are already close to pegging out. After Georgian economy is down and Georgia has no other means to earn its living but leasing its territories for deployment of US air bases, it would be easier to make Georgian government more compliant in the view of the upcoming military operation against Iran. By and large, the Pentagon regards Georgia as a huge staging area and its population as maintenance personnel. \n \n However, the very Georgians should better keep in mind that as soon as the US starts its operation, Iran will be forced to fight back and will attack the nearest target - Georgia, from where US bombers will be taking off. For Georgia itself, it means the repeat of Kosovo fate - massive bombing, thousands of casualties, tens of thousands of refugees and Georgian cities in ruins... What is most deplorable, Saakashvili does not seem to care. He has agreed with the Washington that he will gain absolute freedom for solving tensions with the disobedient autonomies of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in exchange of permission to deploy American troops in Georgia, which enables him to initiate military actions or even ethnical cleansing against the Abkhazians and the Ossetians. No you say bless \"Rose revolution\"! Down with it!",
