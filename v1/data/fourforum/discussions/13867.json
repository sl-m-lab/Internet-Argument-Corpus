Contraceptive and abortion are not the same and therefore should not be used to describe the same thing.\n\n \n You conveniently forget to acknowledge the truth in my analogy. Spanking is assault. The specifics are irrelevant. So why don't we call spanking assault?\n \n \n \nPlease explain how its an exageration. Taking levonorgestrel after conception causes an abortion. How would you like it phrased (without being dishonest)?\n\n \n \"Abortion\" as in the killing of a fetus has a radically different connotation than the simple prevention of implantation. What does it say on the bottle? I doubt it says \"abortion pill\".\n \n \nMuch the same as abortion supporters are prone to calling the human embryo a \"clump of cells\" or \"parasite\". I don't condone exaggerations, on either side, but I fail to see how that applies to calling levonorgestrel an abortion pill.\n\n \n Both of those are completely accurate descriptions, just as the abortion pill is a technically accurate description of the Plan B pill. Don't you find it hypocritical that you defend the morning after pill being called the \"abortion pill\" but are hostile to the embryo/parasite analogy?\n \n \nI did not use a false analogy nor did I introduce a slippery slope. I simply pointed out that the term \"pro-choice\" is extremely vague. Heck, it could be used to describe a store owner that refuses to carry more than one brand of milk. For that matter I think \"pro-life\", while better, is also too vague.\n\n \n Slippery slope fallacy: \"If we let X happen then what is to prevent Y from happening?\"\n If we allow people to choose abortion what is to prevent us from allowing people to choose to murder?\n \n False analogy fallacy: \"A and B are shown to be similar. Then it is argued that since A has property P, so also B must have property P. An analogy fails when the two objects, A and B, are different in a way which affects whether they both have property P.\"\n \n Freedom to choose abortion and freedom to choose murder are shown to be similar. Then it is argued that since freedom to choose murder can be morally wrong, freedom to choose to have an abortion must also be morally wrong.\n \n Sorry it didn't work out for you.",
