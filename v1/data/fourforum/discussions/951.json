   "I like to be rational but I also wish to believe in God. I need some evidence, any evidence, to believe in God and that would be all I would need.\n\n \n The above quote was taken from the Creation vs. Evolution debate thread regarding evidence.\n \n So I am asking two questions:\n \n 1. Is this a view of most or many agnostics?\n 2. What evidence would you need? I know it says any evidence (so I guess it is really answering the question), but AMD stated in that thread that if God would show Himself, AMD would believe. Since this is likely not going to happen, what is the threshold here? What is the other end of the spectrum, meaning what is the least amount of evidence you would accept? I know that is hard to answer, but I hoep someone will give it a shot.\n \n Thanks.",

I know that is hard to answer, but I hoep someone will give it a shot.\n \n Thanks.\n\n \n I'm glad someone mentioned more about this quote of mine. Ever since I had made the quote I had been thinking more about what I said. I know I didn't explain what I meant to well and wish to expand on it now.\n \n One thing I believe is that the end times as indicated in the Bible may be near. Assuming the Bible is legit, which is not something I've considered disregarding, I think the end times will occur in my lifetime and am therefore always interested in learning more about the end times and the events that may lead up to it. In many examples that I have read the end times will be preceded by some event that will show that God exists and people will be given one last chance to repent. I've also read examples that say this evidence will appear after the rapture and people will still have time to repent after that before the end of the world. So with this in mind I'm eagerly looking out for these signs.\n \n The above is one reason that I am unusually eager to accept any sign that God could provide me as proof that he exists. Three days of darkness, a cross in the sky visible throughout the world, the rapture, a major failed attack on Israel, plagues (not necessarily viral), angels, a river drying up in the Middle East, or in a less Godly act, the collapse of all worldly systems and their resurrection by someone in the Middle East. I would quickly accept any of these events as proof of God and the coming of the end times.\n \n But I did also say I would accept far less as well. The examples listed here are things that would really support the idea that the Bible is for real and that God exists. For starters, I have a post in the Religion forum titled Failed Biblical Prophecies where I go into detail on how one part of the Bible cannot be explained. If that could be explained, that may be enough to change my mind on a lot of things. If seven years of peace was put into place in the Middle East, that would change my mind as well as it makes no sense why anyone would choose that number especially with how it is related to the end times. If China and Russia were to ally against the UN and US in a major global conflict, that would really make me thing (Kings of the East vs West). If Russia (North) and the Middle East were to ally together against Israel, that would be disconcerting as well. If a nation from the South was to rise up and defeat a major military threat to the world, that would also help the cause. None of these things are really related to God directly but are related to the Bible and some translations of it that I really put a lot of faith in.\n \n There are probably many more things that I just cannot think of right now but if they were to happen I know it would jog my memory pretty quickly.\n \n But I guess just as important as saving my own soul in the case that God is real, I'd like to just be able to accept that he is real without a doubt so that I could lead a life that isn't so full of questions. As much as I enjoy questioning things, I think it would be nice to have all the answers. I'll never see the day when science finally runs out of questions but if God is real then there is nothing more to question except how to live your own life. I'm sure all the believers of God would feel much better if they could see verifiable proof that God exists and that even science won't try to dispute it anymore.\n \n \nMany? Probably. Most? Probably not.\n I'd say most just don't care.\n \n As a skeptic, I don't think I'd go any lower than direct sensory contact to believe in a supernatural/extraordinary idea like gods, ghosts, aliens, etc.\n\n \n I can't believe that most just don't care, but I think it is true. I'm surprised how I care more about religion than most the Christians I know. Some are fanatically interested beyond anything I ever intend to achieve, but not too many.\n \n Are you sure that you wouldn't begin to believe if something pretty strange started to occur that the Bible sort of spelled out? I think that would be a step down from an individual experience with sensory contact.",
