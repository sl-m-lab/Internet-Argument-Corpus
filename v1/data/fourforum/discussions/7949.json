   "I hope that the Lakota tribe chooses \"Sacred Choices\" as the name of their abortion providing facility. \n \n I think that the name might have been drawn from their history and beliefs as set forth in Black Elk Speaks, John G. Neihardt. Since I am from South Dakota though not a Lakotan, I have found this book to be an invaluable foundation for my own belief system. One story in particular was very, very important to me because it destroyed in an instant all the burdens of inferior womanhood bestowed upon me by Christianity: \n \nThere is a story about the way the pipe first came to us. A very long time ago, they say, two scouts were out looking for bison; and when they came to the top of a high hill and looked north, they saw something coming a long way off, and when it came close they cried out, \"It is a woman!,\" and it was. \n \n Then one of the scouts, being foolish, had bad thoughts and spoke them; but the other said: \"That is a sacred woman; throw all bad thoughts away.\" \n \n When she came still closer, they saw that she wore a fine white buckskin dress, that her hair was very long and that she was young and very beautiful. And she knew their thoughts and said in a voice that was like singing: \"You do not know me, but if you want to do as you think, you may come.\" \n \n And the foolish one went; but just as he stood before her, there was a white cloud that came and covered them. And the beautiful young woman came out of the cloud, and when it blew away the foolish man was a skeleton covered with worms. \n",

   "Oh, sorry, Matthew. Within the context of that culture the foolish one had inappropriate sexual thoughts about the beautiful young woman and did not respect the fact that she was a \"sacred\" woman who should not be viewed as a sexual object. Also she was a woman alone, not surrounded by a retinue of protectors or a big brother or a father, therefore vulnerable and subject to one's sexual desires.\n \n There is nothing wrong with having sexual feelings for a woman whom one knows and respects, and whom one knows well enough to know that the sexual feelings are reciprocated. But, again, this was a Sacred Woman and one puts such feelings aside to gain the teachings of the the Sacred Woman, which the wise one did. \n \n \nThen the woman spoke to the one who was not foolish: \"You shall go home and tell your people that I am coming and that a big tepee shall be built for me in the center of the nation.\" And the man, who was very much afraid, went quickly and told the people, who did as they were told:and there around the big teppe they waited for the sacred woman. After a while she came, very beautiful and singing, and as she went into the tepee this is what she sang:\n \n \"With visible breath I am walking\n A voice I am sending as I walk,\n In a sacred manner I am walking,\n With visible tracks I am walking.\n In a sacred manner I walk.\"\n \n And as she sang, their came from her mouth a white cloud that was good to smell. Then she gave something to the chief, and it was a pipe with a bison calf carved on one side to mean the earth that bears and feeds us, and with twelve eagle feathers hanging from the stem to mean the sky and the twelve moons, and those were tied with a grass that never breaks.\n \n \"Behold!\" she said. \"With this you shall multiply and be a good nation. Nothing but good shall come from it. Only the hands of the good shall take care of it and the bad shall not even see it.\"\n \n Then she sang again and went out of the tepee; and as the people watched her going, suddenly it was a white bison galloping and snorthing, and soon it was gone.\n",

   "I'll let Russell Means speak for the tribe:\n \n Russell Means Visits Camp Casey II\n Means Says He Understands Power Of Women\n By Gene Ellis\n ICONOCLAST REPORTER\n August 31 , 2005 \n CAMP CASEY II - Russell Means' appearance on the stage at Camp Casey II in Crawford yesterday was a surprise to many. For background on this famous Indian (who eschews the government term \"Native American\"), see brief additional biographical information at the end of this story. \n \n Means, a long-time activist, arrived in Central Texas to support the efforts of Cindy Sheehan and her Iraq war protestors. He well understands the power of women. He spoke, both on stage and in a later interview with the Iconoclast, of the matriarchal society of the American Indian. \n \n Motherhood in America has an inkling of the meaning of this, Means mused, but the Indians live it. \n \n He explained that in a family, the mother is the only member who cannot be replaced. Women live longer than men, can stand more pain, have more endurance, he said. At about this point, Means introduced his wife, Pearl, and received a hug from Joan Baez, who was sitting on the floor of the stage with Cindy Sheehan, listening to Means' remarks.\n \n Means said that America has a patriarchal society where men rule alone and in fear of the unknown because they are alone. Matriarchy, he pointed out, is not fear-based. In a matriarchal society, each sex is celebrated for its strengths, and there is local control, male/female balance.\n \n During the later interview with the Iconoclast, Means made a point of saying that he is sincere about women taking control of their power, providing a balanced and positive culture. The Blue and Gold Star mothers have an innate understanding of matriarchy, according to Means, even though, as members of a patriarchal society, they have been brainwashed for many years.\n \n In a matriarchal society, all must be responsible. \n \n \"If the government of this country imposes so many rules, we feel no responsibility for ourselves, and we become careless,\" said Means. To illustrate his point, he used the example of the lack of traffic rules in Italy. Because there are no rules, each person must take it upon his or herself to be responsible, not to be careless, to ensure his or her own safety.\n \n When asked to speak about military recruiters targeting low-income youths, including Indians, Means said that it follows the history of a patriarchal society that the poor kids are to be the common fodder. Even after the Civil War, when Americans wouldn't join the military, European immigrants were pulled off boats and forced to do two years of subscripted service to obtain citizenship. The poor are always a target for military induction, Means concluded.\n \n Means reiterated that if men rule alone in their citadels of power, they are fearful. \n \n A libertarian, Means paraphrased George Washington, \"Government is force, nothing more, nothing less.\" \n \n Means added to this his own thoughts, \"This government is evil. How can patriots support a president over the Constitution? That is treason. The purpose of the first amendment is to encourage dissent. Without dissent, it is impossible to live free.\"\n \n His comments were reminiscent of Margaret Mead's quote that has graced the back of many a tee shirt in Crawford over the last two weeks. It reads, \"Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.\"\n \n The Los Angeles Times has described Russell Means as the most famous American Indian since Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse. \n \n Means is a life-long indigenous rights/constitutional rights activist, actor, artist, and author. His best selling autobiography \"Where White Men Fear to Tread\" is currently on its eighth printing. He has a doctorate in Indian Studies, and is also a practicing attorney on the Sioux Indian Reservation in South Dakota.\n \n For more than 30 years, Means has remained active with the American Indian Movement and has traveled and lectured extensively throughout the world while working for over 12 years with the United Nations. \n \n Means became the first national director of The American Indian Movement (AIM). He is known for helping lead his people to stand against the United States government at the Siege of Wounded Knee in 1973. \n \n His vision is for indigenous people to be free - free to be human, free to travel, free to shop, free to trade where they choose, free to choose their own teachers - free to follow the religion of their fathers, free to talk, think and act for themselves, and then, says Means, they will obey every law or submit to the penalty.\n \n About The Siege at Wounded Knee, he wrote, \"Our aim at Wounded Knee was to force the U.S. government to live up to its own laws. From that, one can draw the real lesson of our stand there: It is the duty of every responsible American to ensure that their government upholds the spirit and the laws of the United States Constitution. After all, what freedom really means is that you are free to be responsible.\"",

Doesn't sound like a very great and powerful claim. (But then again that's not what the priesthood in Catholicism is about--its about humility and service). I think you have been blind to the parallels of the Lakota religious beliefs/patriarchal society and the Christian religious beliefs/patriarchal society. \n \n If you think women are honored more in Lakota society than in Christian--specifically Catholic society--then think about these things:\n \n 1. a woman brought God into the world in the same manner that all mothers bring their own children into the world, Jesus could have just descended or appeared but God chose the most intimate human relationship between mother and child to incarnate himself--therefore Mary is the Mother of the Church and of Salvation, the mother of all Christians Revelation 12:17 and John 19:26-27\n \n 2. a woman is the only human besides Jesus throughout human history considered to be without sin--the Immaculate Conception of Mary\n \n 3. a woman is crowned Queen of Heaven--Revelation 12:1\n \n 4. a woman, Mary, is considered to be so special and intimate in her relationship with God that she was assumed bodily into heaven upon death--the Assumption of Mary--only 3 other people have been given this honor--Elijah, Enoch, and Jesus\n \n 5. there are numerous women named saints in the Church--equal ability and status to live a holy life and be declared definitively in heaven by the Church\n \n 6. there are 3 women named Doctors of the Church and women play prime roles in the Church--think of Mother Seton, Mother Angelica, and Mother Teresa \n \n 7. a woman is considered to be the most perfect disciple of the Church, even before Peter the first pope--Mary never faltered, giving her fiat, \"Let it be done to me as you will.\" whereas Peter doubted and denied Christ three times before he was strengthened to lead the Church\n \n 8. a woman is one of the prime receivers of prayer in Catholic life--the Hail Mary Prayer (most of which is a quotation of scripture)--we ask her to pray for us because of her special and intimate relationship with Jesus\n \n 9. women are protected and defended by the Church even in the face of societal backlash and criticism--they are defended from being a sexual object at the pleasure of men, thus artificial contraception, pornography, masturbation, lust in general is outlawed...and the sacred bond between woman and child is defended exhaustingly\n \n I wonder why you are so accepting of Lakota culture but so prejudiced against Catholic Christian culture.\n \n Finally, I don't think Sacred Choices is a good name for the abortion clinic. I think Sacred Women, Sacred Babies, Sacred Bond violated by Sacreligious Choice might be more appropriate.",

January 2, 2005. A woman is beaten and dragged to a dumpster. It is calculated that her age is 28, and she was found yesterday morning in the Revolucion Mexicana Colonia and has yet to be identified. She suffered cranial trauma, resulting in a 10 cm crack in her skull. Her body was half nude from the waist down and she was found with pieces of stone in her head. A woman found her and made the call to the office. January 3, 2005. The victim dies in the middle of the night without being read her last rites. January 6, 2005. The victim is identified as Josefina Contreras Solis. She was mother to five children and was 38 years old. Her sister identifies her. \n \n Case #2. January 21, 2005 (Friday). A skull is pulled from a recreational area. The rest of the remains are found in a paint barrel. Gender is thought to be female. \n \n Case #3. January 25, 2005 (Tuesday). Another woman is killed. She is between 25 and 30 years old and was found murdered on the corner of Plomo and Privada de Ugarte streets, in Arroyo Colorado Colonia, at 5:30 yesterday morning. Official reports indicate that she suffered four stabbing injuries on her left side and that there were also indications of strangulation around her neck. Until yesterday, she hadn't been identified, with the exception that a man said her name was Edith Sosa and that she was known as Nelly and was the waitress of a local food establishment. She was apparently not murdered in this location, as there was no blood, nor were there noises heard during the night. January 26, 2005 (Wednesday). The woman is identified as Alejandra Medrano Chavarria; she is 25 years of age and the mother of three children-8, 6 and 4 years old. She lived in Francisco Villa Colonia. \n \n Case #4. March 12, 2005. A minor is found, raped and strangled. She was a student at the local middle school and worked in a maquiladora. Her mother identified her as Coral Arrieta Medina, 17 years old. \n \n Case #5. March 22, 2005. A woman's skeleton is found. The terrifying finding was made in the Loma Blanco, an area where many other women's bodies have also been found in the past. \n \n Case #6. January 12, 2005. A woman was murdered by her partner. She was in the last stage of her pregnancy. An emergency Cesaerean section was performed and the child lives, but in critical condition. The woman's name was Claudia Guillen Hinojosa, and she was 28 years old. She was a mother of 2 children-a one year and six month old and a 14 year old. The man is known as Jesus \"Chuy\" and is a known drug dealer. The neighbors heard the beatings but did not inform the authorities. The individual killed Claudia in the presence of her two children.

   "What is the connection between these crimes and Mexico being Catholic? . . .\nYou might want to chew for a while on the concept known as kyryarchy:\n \n \nThe word \"kyriarchy\" literally means \"structures of lordship\" with the interlocking modes of oppression that include sexism, racism, clericalism, heterosexism and imperialism, which give shape to the institutional Roman Catholic Church as we know it. In this sense, the Roman Catholic Church fits nicely into the increasingly globalized, unjust society for which it was originally intended to be a counterpoint. \n \n Sexism, or the relentless dishonouring of women, not only with regard to sexual and reproductive health issues, but also in the intellectually embarrassing recalcitrance on the matter of ordination is but one symptom of Catholic kyriarchy. \n \n Kyriarchy has become a pernicious structure of privilege that is collapsing under its own dead weight, as well it ought. It has an economic and a racist side. Neither women nor people of colour in more than a few exceptional cases have access to the financial resources that belong to the whole church. Contrast the endowments of Regis College and Boston College in Massachusetts, for example, or your average rectory and your average convent, or an African-American or a Hispanic parish and a white, suburban one, and you will see what I mean. Likewise, clericalism, the privileging of those who belong to the clericus or collegium of the ordained, is a signal dimension of kyriarchy. \n \n Clericalism is raised to another level when bishops manage their dioceses like fiefdoms without checks and balances, except, now, for the occasional deposition under oath. \n \n The hypocritical hetero-sexism of kyriarchal Catholicism is finally coming to light. Unfortunately, it has taken the current sex scandals--the majority of which involve adult men in power taking sexual advantage of boys or young men--to force Catholics to come to grips with the fact that a large percentage (I agree with those who claim it is the maj6rity) of its priests are gay, whether sexually active or not. Church historian Mark Jordan describes what he calls the \"honeycomb of closets\" (The Silence of Sodom) to convey the complexity of hidden homosexuality which has so traumatized the kyriarchal church. \n \n In my view, the sexual orientation of priests is largely irrelevant, except as it intersects with the homo-hating Catholic culture. Indeed, most of pedophilia is engaged in by heterosexual men who use their power to sexually take advantage of girls. The crime of pedophilia is the crime of pedophilia. Yet, this largely male-on-male pedophilia seems to be a function of easier access to boys in a patriarchal church bent on attracting them to the priesthood. These are not functions of homosexuality as such, but of sexism and homo-hatred. The sexual abuse of nuns and other women continues to be all but passed over. . . . \n\n http://www.highbeam.com/library/docfree.asp?DOCID=1G1:111616440&ctrlInfo=Round19%3AMode19b%3ADocG%3AResult&ao=\n \n Now, frankly, I would prefer not to muddle around in Roman Catholic affairs but the Roman Catholic Church refuses to butt out of my life, out of my daughters' lives, out of my granddaughters' lives. And, it cannot be denied that women in Roman Catholic Latin America are constantly under the threat of assault. I encountered my very first assault, truth be known, in very Roman Catholic Alburquerque, New Mexico, as I was walking to my workplace very early in the morning.

   "Here is Chesterton's own words regarding the question of agnosticism, from his book Orthodoxy, Chapter 6:\n \n \n I was a pagan at the age of twelve, and a complete agnostic by the age of sixteen; and I cannot understand any one passing the age of seventeen without having asked himself so simple a question. I did, indeed, retain a cloudy reverence for a cosmic deity and a great historical interest in the Founder of Christianity. \n\n \n Sorry, this is not agnosticism, it is perhaps lukewarm Christianity, nothing more. It is hedging the Pascal's Wager bet; sitting on the fence with one foot still planted on Christianity's side. It makes for great drama to announce to one's readers to be one thing before being transformed into another, but seeing that most of his orthodox readers have no experience with agnosticism, it easily passes under the radar. \n \n \n But I certainly regarded Him as a man; though perhaps I thought that, even in that point, He had an advantage over some of His modern critics. I read the scientific and sceptical literature of my time -- all of it, at least, that I could find written in English and lying about; and I read nothing else; I mean I read nothing else on any other note of philosophy. \n\n \n Note that even in his darkest hour, when his 'search' was most acute, he still can't admit that he was agnostic, that he held an honest doubt, that Christianity may not be true. More hedging his bet. He will not be accused of writing a sentence that could be used against him in the great future court of law. \n \n \n \n The penny dreadfuls which I also read were indeed in a healthy and heroic tradition of Christianity; but I did not know this at the time. I never read a line of Christian apologetics. I read as little as I can of them now. It was Huxley and Herbert Spencer and Bradlaugh who brought me back to orthodox theology. \n\n \n So, he read atheistic arguments and rejected them. Christians often claim to do this, and often find the rational arguments 'ill-tempered' or rebuttals merely 'petty criticism'. \n \n \n \n They sowed in my mind my first wild doubts of doubt. Our grandmothers were quite right when they said that Tom Paine and the free-thinkers unsettled the mind. They do. They unsettled mine horribly. \n\n \n He doesn't realize the large contradiction he has placed before his readership. He's in effect saying, \"I was an agnostic, but rejected all agnostic thought as soon as I read about it.\" I may as well say I'm a Pastafarian, and soon I will look it up in Wikipedia to see if my thinking is in line with Pastafarianism. If it isn't, I'll be an ex-Pastafarian. I may write a book about my dramatic deconversion.\n \n He reveals also his early Christian bent in his reference to his family's indoctrination, which is why Christianity for him and millions of others is the default position, and why he never truly entertained skepticism. \n \n \n The rationalist made me question whether reason was of any use whatever; and when I had finished Herbert Spencer I had got as far as doubting (for the first time) whether evolution had occurred at all. As I laid down the last of Colonel Ingersoll's atheistic lectures the dreadful thought broke across my mind, \"Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.\" I was in a desperate way. \n\n \n The typical close-mindedness of a person who already has his mind made up is all too apparent. Some may buy into this recollection of his young life, but I find the story all too contrived, and embellished for dramatic purposes.\n \n It's not nice to try to fool fellow agnostics.

   "Violence Against Women in Latin America\n A MADRE Position Paper\n Violence against women in Latin America reflects global trends, mediated by histories and conditions specific to the region. These include colonization, war, migration, and neoliberalism. As in other regions, gender-based violence was integral to the European conquest of Latin America, setting a pernicious pattern in which Indigenous women have been disproportionately targeted for rape as a weapon of war. Non-Indigenous women have also been abused during armed conflicts, including more than 70 US military interventions into their countries. Under the military regimes of the Southern Cone countries in the 1970s, thousands of women endured the disappearance and murder of their children and other loved ones, while women political prisoners were systematically subjected to sexual torture. Violence against women was also a widespread counter-insurgency tactic in Central America in the 1980s. \n \n During the 1990s, women in the heavily militarized state of Chiapas, Mexico were subjected to sexual harassment, rape, forced prostitution and compulsory servitude in military camps. Since the 2001 terrorist attacks in the US, Latin American governments have followed the Bush Administration's lead in subordinating human rights to militarized notions of \"national security\". The trend has undermined governments' obligations to human rights, including women's right to a life free of violence.\n \n Women who were active in the region's liberation and democracy struggles during the 1970s and 1980s gradually developed an autonomous women's movement that grew to challenge violence against women. However, the defeat and co-optation of liberation struggles in the 1990s undermined progressive politics, including the fight against gender violence. In Nicaragua, for example, the 1990 electoral defeat of the Sandinistas refortified the Catholic Church and its oppressive gender policies. A powerful institution in all Latin American countries, the Church hierarchy reinforces gender violence by encouraging reconciliation in cases of domestic violence and denying women reproductive rights. The end of armed conflicts also created new political spaces in which women have mobilized to pursue anti-violence agendas. For example, Guatemalan women have demanded legislative reforms in the context of the 1996 peace accords.\n \n As the most marginalized sector of Latin American societies, Indigenous women are effectively denied access to most public services-including education, medical care, police protection, telephone service and transportation-that could prevent or redress violence. In fact, public services are themselves a site of violence against Indigenous women. For example, in numerous Latin American countries, poor and Indigenous women seeking professional healthcare have been forcibly sterilized. Many rural Indigenous women do not speak fluent Spanish-the language of public education, mass media and the courts. Even inside the women's movement, persistent racism means that programs to combat violence against women usually do not include segments designed by Indigenous women and therefore do not adequately address the problem as it affects them. . . .\n \n http://www.madre.org/articles/int/b10/violence.html",

   "Domestic Violence: An Ongoing Threat to Women in Latin America and the Caribbean\n by Liz Creel with special reporting by Sara Lovera and Miriam Ruiz\n (October 2001) Despite laws against domestic violence, many women in Latin America and the Caribbean continue to be failed by the legal system. In Mexico, for example, two 30-year-old women from Mexico City recently suffered the consequences of intimate partner abuse, according to Comunicaci\u00f3n e Informaci\u00f3n de la Mujer, Asociaci\u00f3n Civil (CIMAC) and La Jornada. Rocio Mancilla had an extramarital affair and was killed by her husband last April. He received less than two years in jail because he pleaded \"violent emotion.\" International business specialist Carolina Gaona's husband threatened her life in October 2000. A judge, who was sympathetic to her husband's feelings of jealousy, sentenced her to return home. \n \n To date, nearly 30 countries in the region have enacted laws against domestic violence or have characterized the violence as a crime. Surveys from various countries, however, indicate that an estimated 10 percent to 50 percent of women report being physically assaulted by their male partner. This violence exacts a heavy toll.\n \n \"Violence against women devastates people's lives, fragments communities, and prevents countries from developing,\" said Noeleen Heyzer, executive director of the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) at the 2001 Symposium on Gender Violence, Health and Rights in the Americas in Cancun, Mexico.\n \n Domestic violence is increasingly recognized as a critical public health problem by organizations like the Pan American Health Organization and the Inter-American Commission of Women of the Organization of American States and as a serious violation of basic human rights under international treaties. According to the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), countries in the region invest 2 percent of their gross domestic product (GDP) in addressing its effects on victims. Victims of domestic violence average more surgeries, physician and pharmacy visits, hospital stays, and mental health consultations than other women.\n \n Experts agree that women are most exposed and unsafe in their own homes. Husbands or partners are responsible for the majority of aggression, injuries, sexual abuse, and homicide. One 1996 study of domestic violence cases in 17 states in Brazil by researchers Luiz Sores, Barbara Soares, and Leandro Carneiro for Movimento Nacional de Direitos Humanos, a human rights organization in the country, indicated that husbands, companions, or former partners had committed 230 prior assaults as opposed to 31 by relatives, neighbors, or others.\n \n Enforcement of Laws Remains a Major Concern\n Enforcement of domestic violence laws remains a major concern. Police often fail to respond or are hostile to women who report domestic violence. To address this situation, women's groups in the region have begun to promote special women's police units to be run and staffed by women. Brazil was the first country to establish these special units in 1985 with five countries following suit. According to the IADB, success has been mixed due to units' shortage of staff, inadequate infrastructure, and lack of social and psychological support teams.\n \n In many countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, police require women to undergo a medical examination and receive a certificate before they can file an official complaint for domestic violence. The medical certificate may be the only evidence to substantiate the victims' testimonies and provide them with legal protection and redress. Medical examiners frequently underreport injuries sustained through domestic violence due to the difficulty of determining what this violence constitutes. Consequently, many medical examiners classify injuries they perceive as less serious as a misdemeanor rather than a felony. For instance, superficial wounds like bruises would constitute a less serious infraction than broken bones. This has profound consequences as misdemeanor offenses carry much less stringent penalties than felonies. In Peru, for example, misdemeanor offenses carry a maximum penalty of 20 to 30 days of community service.\n \n Human Rights Watch, a human rights nongovernmental organization (NGO), cites the 1996 case of Ver\u00f3nica Alvarez, a 36-year-old mother in Lima, Peru, who was hit in the face with a metal typewriter by her partner and left permanently scarred. Because the medical examiner classified her injuries as needing fewer than 10 days of treatment and recuperation, Ver\u00f3nica's case was classified as a misdemeanor.\n \n The justice system in many countries may fail to make adequate use of protection measures. According to Movimiento Manuela Ramos, an NGO in Peru that provides legal counsel to victims of domestic violence, prosecutors issued protective measures in only one out of 45 domestic violence cases filed in Lima in 1996 and 1997.\n \n In other instances, judges may not order protective measures quickly enough or judges may let measures expire, leaving victims with no protection. The law may also be flawed. In Peru, the law urges conciliation over prosecution, and state prosecutors prefer to hold mediation hearings even when the victim's life may be at risk. This sends a disturbing message that violent interpersonal relationships should be resolved through negotiation rather than punishment.\n \n Other problems include victims' ignorance of the law and their rights, hesitance in reporting injuries, and the reluctance of judges to take action. In Nicaragua, according to the 1998 Demographic and Health Survey, over one-third of women who had been abused by their partners had never told anyone. Research suggests that shame and fear of reprisal are primary reasons why many women remain silent. . . .\n \n http://www.prb.org/Template.cfm?Section=PRB&template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID=4744",

   "CHILEANS FACING UP TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE\n INTERNATIONAL\n By Jen Ross - WeNews commentator\n SANTIAGO, Chile (WOMENSENEWS)--Four years ago, just before Christmas, Teresa Lobos was planning her suicide.\n \n After 17 years of physical and emotional abuse by her husband, she says she had hit rock bottom.\n \n \"I went into a crisis that night and I wanted to kill myself,\" say Lobos, 40, her husky voice cracking. \"I imagined tying the noose and everything. Death was on my doorstep.\" Domestic abuse is widespread across Latin America.\n \n Women who report having been beaten by a spouse range from 22 percent in the Dominican Republic to 44 percent in Colombia, according to a June 2004 survey by Monitoring and Evaluation to Assess and Use Results, or MEASURE, a Maryland-based organization that collects data for The U.S. Agency for International Development. The 2002 U.S. National Crime Victimization Survey shows 1-in-5 crimes against women were violent incidents involving an intimate partner.\n \n But in Chile--widely recognized as one of the most conservative and family-oriented countries in the region--it's a problem that had long been obscured by a lack of reporting or national statistics.\n \n First National Registry \n This year, however, prompted by a growing tide of public concern over social issues, the first national registry of domestic violence was released by SERNAM, the Spanish acronym for the government's National Service for Women.\n \n The survey, which began in 2001, found that half of all women have suffered domestic violence. One-in-three adult women has been abused physically by a partner and 2-in-5 have suffered emotional abuse. And 70 women are killed by their partners every year.\n \n In response, the government in November launched a campaign to raise awareness of the problem, including several new laws, which are awaiting approval in Congress and would make abuse of a spouse a crime.\n \n Last month, as more than 2,000 people protested the lack of awareness about domestic violence in a Santiago march organized by SERNAM to mark International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, 36-year-old Magaly Jara Valenzuela was raped and killed by her husband in Santiago's southern district of San Ramon.\n \n Outpouring of Media Attention \n The ugly coincidence launched an outpouring of media attention. Cecilia Perez, the cabinet member who heads SERNAM, says she was surprised by the increased interest and credits public involvement for pushing the issue out of the closet. \n \n \"There has been an institutionalized discrimination between men and women, even by the state,\" says Perez. \"We have to admit it.\"\n \n That is changing, however, and in a country that has never had a female head of state, the two most likely presidential contenders for the 2005 election are women. (See Women's eNews Cheers and Jeers, Dec. 25)\n \n Still, Perez says domestic violence advocates have an uphill battle: \"Our social relations are based on gender inequality and are very historic and ingrained. So this gets reproduced culturally and is expressed sometimes in the most brutal and extreme forms of violence.\"\n \n Problem Increases around Holidays \n It's a problem that, as in the rest of the world, increases around Christmas time, Lobos says, as substance abuse rises along with holiday celebrations involving alcohol.\n \n But this holiday season Teresa Lobos is far from suicidal.\n \n Today, she is separated and awaiting a divorce. She's studying to become a social worker who specializes in addictions and abuse. And she volunteers as a counselor of families affected by domestic abuse at the Intra-Family Socio-Ecological Program run by the Barros Luco Hospital in Santiago. It's the same grassroots intervention program that helped her regain control of her fate four years ago.\n \n Paola Cabello is one of the women counseled by Lobos. Cabello describes how her partner would beat her in fits of jealousy. And how she started fighting back, sometimes hitting him before he'd hit her.\n \n \"I've been hit all my life,\" says Cabello. \"I thought it was normal. But now I'm learning to say things. At least in the past three months that I've been in this program, I haven't hit anyone and I haven't been hit either. But I feel helpless and cry a lot because I don't know how else to control situations now.\"\n \n Court-Ordered Conciliation \n Both Cabello and her husband arrived at the Barros Luco Hospital by court order and after domestic abuse conciliation. This kind of forced treatment is new and part of a wider government effort to curb domestic abuse. The effort includes a network of victim centers where women receive counselling and legal advice.\n \n Perez says secrecy and the sanctity of the family space have been other barriers, which is why SERNAM has embarked on a new ad campaign launched last month. She points out that domestic violence has only been considered an infraction for the past 10 years in Chile. Currently, a judge can only scold offenders, through a process called conciliation, and order them into abuse prevention programs.\n \n But Perez says that for real progress to be made, domestic violence needs to be made a crime punishable by jail. She points out that 2001 figures reveal that at least one-third of those who underwent conciliation hit their partners again.\n \n This year the Chilean government tabled a new law to establish family tribunals which would provide police protection and yield convictions (although Congress has yet to define sentences). Perez says 92 percent of domestic violence cases do not reach the courtroom because abuse is not considered a crime. Only extreme cases, usually involving murder or attempted murder, get prosecuted.\n \n \"Conciliation doesn't do anything to prevent them from re-offending,\" she says. \"The family tribunals law will provide faster, yet more human treatment for victims, as well as more protection for those who are being threatened and a higher rate of convictions.\"\n \n The law is currently before the Senate, and Perez expects it could be passed as early as March.\n \n http://www.feminist.com/news/vaw38.html",

   "GUATEMALA:\n Violence Against Women Unchecked and Unpunished\n Manuel Berm\u00fadez \n SAN JOS\u00c9, Nov 25 (IPS) - Hundreds of people marched through the streets of Guatemala City Friday to mark the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, painting X's on judicial buildings and security agencies to protest the failure to protect women and bring the perpetrators to justice. \n \n \"An average of 14 or 15 murders a day are committed in Guatemala,\" human rights prosecutor Sergio Morales told IPS, noting that so far this year, 560 women have been slain, and not a single murderer has been convicted. \n \n Guatemala's homicide rate is among the highest in Latin America, one of the most violent regions in the world. \n \n \"Since 2001, the phenomenon has grown in both quantitative and qualitative terms, because these murders are accompanied by extreme violence, which aggravates the victims' suffering,\" by contrast to male murder victims, who are almost always killed by firearms, he explained. \n \n Civil society groups, meanwhile, complain about the justice system's failure to investigate the murders of women. \n \n \"We are seeing a setback with regard to the rights of women, not only in terms of the killings, which are the most brutal expression, but also with respect to all kinds of violence against women, which the state justifies and tolerates,\" activist Andrea Barrios told IPS. \n \n Barrios belongs to the Centre for Legal Action on Human Rights (CALDH) and the 25 de Noviembre Coordinator, an umbrella group of more than 30 organisations. \n \n Morales said that \"unfortunately, our justice system has been incapable of bringing to trial and punishing those who planned or committed the more than 1,600 murders of women that have occurred in the past four years.\" \n \n Citing a statement by the office of the prosecutor of crimes against life, he said that \"of the 2,400 cases it was handling, it was only investigating 40.\" \n \n The report \"Guatemala: No protection, no justice: Killings of women in Guatemala\", released by the London-based human rights group Amnesty International in June, states that the alarming increase in the number of killings of women is compounded by impunity, weak laws, and a firmly entrenched \"machista\" or sexist mindset. \n \n On the eve of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, Amnesty International called for protest demonstrations in front of the Guatemalan embassies in Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela. . . .\n \n http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=31192",

   "Silence and Complicity: Violence Against Women in Peruvian Public Health Facilities \n Peruvian women are being subjected to violence in that nation's government-run health facilities, say women lawyers who have documented cases of abuse throughout several geographical regions of the country. This investigative book reveals sexual and psychological violence against women who use public reproductive health and family planning services. The book was researched and written by the Center for Reproductive Rights and the Lima branch of the Comit\u00e9 Latinoamericano y del Caribe para la Defensa de la Mujer (CLADEM). \"The findings of the investigation reveal the Peruvian government's lack of commitment to promoting and protecting women's human rights,\" says Luisa Cabal, a staff attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights. \n \n Silence and Complicity includes cases of rape, humiliating verbal abuse, and violations of women's reproductive autonomy, such as their right to informed consent. Attorneys for the Center for Reproductive Rights and CLADEM assert that under international law, the government of Peru is responsible for the acts of violence and other abuses committed by providers of public health services. The government is also responsible for the absence of effective mechanisms to prevent these acts, the systematic cover-up of violations, and the failure to punish those responsible through existing administrative and judicial channels. \n \n Cases documented in the book demonstrate that abuse occurs predominantly against young women, women living in poverty, and women from rural areas or marginalized urban areas. \"It is precisely these women who account for the extremely high rate of maternal mortality in Peru,\" says Cabal. \n \n http://www.crlp.org/pub_bo_silence.html",

   ". . . . In courts of law, the 'honour defence' is institutionalized in some Middle Eastern and Latin American countries, allowing fathers or husbands to walk away from murder. In 12 Latin American countries, a rapist can be exonerated if he offers to marry the victim and she accepts. In one country, Costa Rica, he can be exonerated even if she refuses his offer. The family of the victim frequently pressures her to marry the rapist, which they believe restores the family's honour. . . .\n \n http://www.unicef.org/pon97/women1b.htm",

   "http://inquirer.gn.apc.org/catholicgender.html\n \n Jan/Feb 19 from NACLA's \"Report on the Americas\" \n The Gender Wars by Jean Franco \n Jean Franco is the author of Plotting Women: Gender and Representation in Mexico (Columbia University Press, 1990) and a member of NACLA's editorial board. \n \n In July of last year, several members of the Argentine planning committee that had drawn up the guidelines for a nationwide curriculum resigned when they discovered that changes to their proposal had been made, apparently by the Minister of Education under pressure from the Catholic Church. Mention of Darwin and Lamarck had been eliminated, references to sex education had been erased, and the word \"gender\" had replaced by \"sex.\" \n \n The Auxiliary Bishop of Buenos Aires, Hector Aguer, defended the removal of the word \"gender,\" arguing that its use \"intended to provoke an ideological shift and to generate a new conception of the human person, of subjectivity, marriage, the family and society. In short what is proposed is a cultural revolution.\" Using the word gender \"as a purely cultural construct, detached from the biological,\" he warned, \"makes us into fellow travelers of radical feminism.\" Bishop Aguer went on to quote well-known U.S. feminist Shulamit Firestone's The Dialectic of Sex to highlight the \"dangers\" of feminism. Firestone applied Marxist dialectics to the male/female relationship, said Aguer, \"in order to reach the conclusion that Marx had not dared to make: namely to modify the sexual condition of woman to liberate her from maternity and her dependence on the family.\" \n \n While it may be amusing to think of the Catholic Church hierarchy wading through feminist theory, its attempts to demonize feminism by associating it with communism should not be taken lightly. The fact that the debate over gender has surfaced simultaneously in recent months in many different Latin American countries suggests that this concern for semantics masks a surreptitious campaign against women's and gay rights. \n \n In post-1960s feminism, gender refers to socially constituted differences between masculine and feminine. This definition of gender is considered a dangerously destabilizing concept in Latin American circles close to the Catholic Church, one that undermines the natural relations of marriage and reproduction. According to critics of \"gender,\" once people accept that differences between men and women are socially constructed and hence modifiable, then the road is open for legalized abortion, the acceptance of homosexuality, the recognition of \"irregular\" families, and the collapse of family values. \n \n The touchiness of the Church on this matter can be read as a reaction to the growing number and influence of feminist and women's groups. While only a handful of feminist organizations existed in Latin America two decades ago, today, there are some [GIVE NUMBER] according to [TK FEMINIST ORGANIZATION]. Women have also become prominent actors in grassroots social movements throughout the continent. While these two sectors of the Latin American women's movement have their differences, there is an ongoing effort by many groups to bridge the divide. In fact, some sectors within the grassroots women's movement have become increasingly receptive to feminist political goals, including the championing of reproductive rights. The Church views this trend with alarm. By challenging the word \"gender\" and alternative definitions of family, the Church hopes to strike a blow at the very foundations of feminism. \n \n The Catholic Church's position appears to be out of touch with public opinion. For example, it continues to oppose birth control, even though most Latin American women favor-- and use--some form of artificial contraception. A poll taken in Lima after President Alberto Fujimori's recent decision to make contraception available to poor families is a case in point. The poll showed that 95% of the population believed in God, yet 80% also thought that Peruvians agreed with using contraceptives. Likewise, the Church considers abortion a \"grave sin,\" yet it is widely practiced in the region. Given the difficulties of access to contraceptive methods, abortion has become a major form of birth control in Latin America. In Chile, there are an estimated 170,000 abortions a year. One out of every two pregnancies in Mexico and one out of every three in Peru ends in abortion. Since abortions are performed clandestinely and often in less than optimal conditions, this is also a pressing health issue for Latin American women. Abortion is the fourth most common cause of maternity deaths and the third most common cause of hospitalization in Mexico. In Colombia, 74.5% of maternal deaths are the result of botched abortions. \n \n \"Family\" is the other sensitive issue, not only because of gay and lesbian households but also because the Church's ideal of a married couple as the pillar of society is unrealistic for many Latin American women. In the poorest sectors of society, women often bring up children on their own. In Chile for example, 40% of all families are not headed by a married man and woman. Of every seven babies born in \n \n that country, one is the child of an adolescent, and in 61% of those cases, the baby is the offspring of an unmarried mother. \n \n Instead of recognizing these realities, the Vatican is trying to discredit feminism. In order to do this, the Church uses trendy-sounding rhetoric which equates feminist platforms with imperialism. The bishopric of Argentina recently argued that abortion is a form of \"modern biological colonialism inspired by powerful nations that impose their decisions on those of weaker peoples who cannot make themselves heard,\" and he urged the faithful to stand up against this \"colonialism.\" The Catholic Church's defense of the poor-- especially in these neoliberal times--is a praiseworthy goal, and the argument that the North is imposing population policies on the South is not without some validity. But for many women in the hemisphere, abortion is not an absolute good--it is, rather, a desperate remedy.\n \n (More)",

   "Precisely because its position is so rigid (neither abortion nor contraception) and has so little relation to reality, the Vatican must woo women by other means. In a clear fence- mending move prior to the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, Pope John Paul II addressed a Letter to Women in which he thanks them for their devotion, and praises their mission as mothers, wives, daughters, workers and nuns. \n \n In his letter, the Pope recognizes that women have frequently been marginalized and even reduced to slavery, and he expresses regret that certain \"sons of the Church\" might have contributed to women's oppression. He refrains, however, from exploring the reasons for this situation on the grounds that \"it would not be easy to attribute precise responsibility considering the strength of cultural sedimentations that, through the centuries, have formed people's mentalities.\" What the Pope does not seem to realize is that, when he refers to the obstacles that impede women's full incorporation into social, political and economic life, he needs the word \"gender\" in order to explain the \"cultural sedimentations\" that account for inequalities. \n \n It is in the world conferences organized by the United Nations that the Vatican is most active in its campaign against feminism and reproductive rights. The Vatican's observer status at the United Nations gives it the right to participate in these UN conferences--a right not accorded to any other religious group. As Cecilia Olivares of the Free Choice Information Group (GIRE) in Mexico points out, \"Despite its status as observer, the Vatican--a state that includes neither women nor children in its territory and whose members don't have sex and do not reproduce since they have a made a vow of chastity--places obstacles in the way of decisions on the sexual and reproductive lives of millions of people on the planet.\" \n \n In the planning stages of the Rio de Janeiro Conference on Environment and Development (1992), the Cairo Conference on Population and Development (1994), and the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing (1995), the Vatican was vocal on questions of family, marriage, divorce and reproductive health. For example, the Church put pressure on Latin American governments to send anti-abortion delegates to the Cairo conference. Around the same time, Argentine President Carlos Menem was recruited to the cause, and tried to get a declaration affirming the sacredness of life from the moment of conception included in the Presidential Summit Meeting of Latin American leaders held in Cartagena just before Cairo. Once the Cairo conference got underway, the Vatican allied itself with Islamic fundamentalists in an attempt to scuttle documents favoring reproductive rights. When it was unsuccessful in its bid to erase certain clauses from the final documents, it resorted to insisting on bracketing phrases it considered controversial, including \"family group\" and \"gender.\" \n \n Harshly criticized for its heavy-handed approach in Cairo, the Church shifted gears in the preparations for the Beijing conference, initiating an all-out ideological war against the concept of gender. A key battlesite was the \"Draft Platform for Action,\" a preparatory document for the Beijing conference. The platform is a complex document that deals with a vast number of women's issues--from population to the feminization of poverty to violence against women. One objection raised by Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Vals was that the word \"gender\" was used more frequently than the word \"mother.\" Archbishop of Tegucigalpa and president of the Latin American Episcopal Conference, Oscar Rodriguez, asserted that the aim of the Beijing Conference was \"to force society to accept five types of gender: masculine, feminine, lesbian, homosexual and transsexual.\" The preparatory document gives no evidence to support such a claim. \"The differences between women's and men's achievements and activities,\" the draft platform states, \"are still not recognized as the consequences of socially constructed gender roles rather than immutable biological differences.\" But, of course, this was precisely the definition of gender that the Vatican found perturbing. \n \n (More)",

   "The news that the word \"gender\" was unacceptable quickly surfaced in Latin American discussions prior to Beijing. In Chile, it began even before Josefina Bilbao, minister of the National Women's Service (SERNAM), had published the government position paper on Beijing. In an interview with Politica y Sociedad, she tried to wiggle out of the controversy by defining gender according to the Dictionary of the Royal Academy as \"a group of beings who have one or various characteristics in common.\" \n \n Once the position paper was published and being debated in the Senate, Bilbao attempted to sidestep the issue of gender altogether, focusing instead on the conference themes of poverty, education, and political participation, as she would do in the paper she presented at the Beijing conference. A group of conservative senators, however, challenged the document, centering their attack on the use of the word \"gender.\" The senators complained that \"many people use the word without further clarification, claiming that masculine and feminine respond merely to cultural and sociological constructions and not to biological conditions that constitute the psychology of woman and man. According to this conception, the difference between the sexes does not have a natural origin, a view that has consequences for the individual, for the family, and for society.\" These \"ambiguous ideas\" were declared unacceptable. \n \n The alternative position paper that the senators came up with, although eventually defeated, is illustrative of what lies behind the struggle over the meaning of gender. Every Chilean, said the dissident senators, had the constitutional duty to preserve \"the essential values of Chilean tradition.\" They claimed to be defending that tradition against \"value- oriented totalitarianism\" (read: feminism), which they argued would allow all kinds of unnatural practices. The family was defined by these senators as the stable union of men and women within marriage, and any term or action that threatened the family or \"admitted that persons of the same sex might constitute a family\" was deemed inadmissable. Senator Hernan Larrain Fernandez reminded Bilbao that she herself had declared that homosexual families were not \"part of Chilean reality.\" Larrain also argued that reproductive rights implied a view of reproduction in a \"purely animal context, dehumanized the concept of sex, and opened the door to the argument in favor of abortion.\" These rights were described as \"highly inconvenient and dangerous.\" Clearly, the senators' position is an argument for the exclusion of gay men and women from citizenship and the criminalization of abortion. \n \n The Catholic Church has also found itself pitted against multilateral lending agencies over population-control policies. The World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank see these policies as a way to reduce poverty and facilitate women's participation in the wage-labor force. Latin American governments are caught in a bind between this imperative to \"modernize\" and opposition to birth control and abortion coming from the Church and other conservative groups. As a consequence, Latin American delegates at Beijing tended to maintain a low profile. \n \n Peru illustrates the hard choices that neoliberal governments face on this issue. In his inaugural address to the nation on July 28 of last year, President Fujimori unexpectedly broke ranks with other Latin American countries on the issue of birth control, announcing that the state would facilitate access to family planning for poor families. \"We have been and shall continue to be a pragmatic government, without taboos or 'sacred cows,'\" he said, in a pointed reference to the Church. \"Peruvian women must be in control of their own destinies.\" \n \n Fujimori was playing the modernization card, appealing to international lending organizations by promising that by the year 2000 poverty would be reduced by 50% and that 50% of social spending would be for women. A government document drawn up in 1993 and obtained by the Peruvian journal Oiga revealed exactly how large the population problem loomed in the government's scheme of things. The document forecast that, in terms of its current growth, within four decades Peru would have to support \"a population of eight million hungry uneducated and unemployed people in a climate of absolute poverty and deeply inured delinquency.\" For those belonging to this \"social surplus,\" vasectomies for men and tubal ligation for women were recommended. Not surprisingly, this language led to comparisons between Fujimori's population control and the Nazi's final solution. Church leaders denounced it as a proposal \"for the 'mutilation' of men and women by the power of darkness.\" \n \n Fujimori answered his critics in a speech at Beijing, where he characterized himself as \"a blue-jeans President\" in touch with contemporary problems. He announced that a \"social miracle\" which would boost women from mere survival into productive development would follow his \"economic miracle.\" However, this claim to be protecting women rings hollow given that Fujimori has demolished workers' rights, including regulations that specifically relate to the health and safety of women in the workplace. \n \n Meanwhile, the Catholic Church continues its virulent opposition to reproductive rights. The gender debate it has prompted in Latin America is clearly a smoke screen for a vicious attack on women's rights. Not only is the Church fighting a losing battle, but more seriously, its campaign has obscured the real issues. The Beijing conference, if it achieved nothing else, registered the fact that \"women's issues\"--including their human rights--have moved to the center of the world's political agendas. Both multilateral lending organizations and feminist groups are in favor of promoting sex education, making contraception widely available to women, and decriminalizing abortion. It seems clear, however, that these common stances rest on fundamentally different assumptions. While Latin American feminists see these issues as essentially about the rights of women to control their own lives, the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank are primarily interested in population control. Illegal abortion, perhaps the most inflammatory issue, is a significant threat to women's health in Latin America, and criminalization only serves to perpetuate the problem. On the other hand, emphasis on birth control and abortion rights to the exclusion of women's education, development, and changing role in society is just as questionable. It is these debates that should have been foregrounded and not the struggle over the use of the word gender.",

   "Simone. I must say you are very well documented on the issue, or you at the least have made sure to read and include a large amount of articles and sources in favour of your position. However, as a Latin American, I don't think they reflect the complex reality of the region with all justice. Of course, there is nothing untrue about many things said in these articles, but they are taken out of the Latin American context and judged without a true perspective of the social realities in place.\n \n Domestic violence is a very important problem in Latin America, and, as your articles have stated, it is more or less widespread across several areas of the Continent. However, the relationship between Catholicism and the Church with this phenomenon (which is the point of most of your articles) is not as your articles portray. Roman Catholicism (like most other Christian denominations) is a relgion that professes LOVE and SELFLESSNESS, it is insulting for you to say that the Church tolerates, or even endorses, domestic violence. This is not in contact with reality. The role and position of the Catholic Church in Latin America is much more prominent than in other regions for various reasons: 1) we are a vast majority of Catholics; 2) we are poor countries, so lots of the Church's humanitarian efforts go the region; 3) we have a very profound historical Catholic tradition and customs. The Church is by very very very far the largest humanitarian institution in Latin America, and it is also a very significant educational institution, and I'm not talking about the costly Catholic private schools you picture in the U.S., I'm talking about missionary schools, professional schools (for poor unemployed people) and also family centres and counsels. In all this huge job the Church does in the Continent, I am positively certain that not a single case of domestic violence is left unadressed, tolerated or justified. It is a grave sin, you know, a very grave one.\n \n Also, I don't think it's fair to say Catholicism is a direct cause of such practises because it is simply a gross (and I must say rather paternalistic and insulting) simplification of the richness and historical complexity of Latin American culture. A society and the problems it has are derived from very complicated and entangled historical processes that, in the case of Latin America, are at least 700 years old, and include the influx of Indigenous, European and later American (U.S.) culture and ideas. This is exaclty what H.H. Pope John Paul II spoke of when he said that \"it would not be easy to attribute precise responsibility considering the strength of cultural sedimentations that, through the centuries, have formed people's mentalities\", he was not at all referring to gender of course (as your articles suggest).\n \n Also, the solutions we provide for things like domestic violence are not \"faulty\" like your articles say. We attempt to promote reconcilliation and forgiveness, instead of outright separation and destruction of the family. Why? 1) Because we believe the family is the fundamental basic cell that sustains and gives sense to society; 2) because the vast majority of couples in Latin America have children, and we want to protect them as well. This of course does not mean that offenders mustn't be punished by the full weight of the law for their horrendous actions, but increasing the confrontation by promoting separation and family breakup is simply not what we envision for a society that acknowledges and respects the value and significance of the family institution.\n \n With respect to the reality of Latin America, the response of governments to the issue is not (like your articles suggest) of mere indifference or blindness. You know why so little money is spent in Latin America on redress for victims, family counseling, general education, health and other social issues? Because in practically all cases about 50% of out nacional budgets go to pay off 200 year old external debts with the First World countries and institutions (including your beloved World Bank). Do you think we have enough resources to effectively tackle any serious problem? Let alone this one? Many people don't go to school, don't have houses, are unemployed and are subject to all kinds of abuses (domestic and otherwise)... We simply cannot handle everything at once.\n \n With respect to abortion in Latin America, although it is true that many clandestine abortions take place, not a single one of our countries has made the practise legal, and I hope this doesn't change. Instead, I hope to see the reduction of poverty, the education of the illiterate masses and the moralisation of our societies in favour of the family and the dignity of the human person (man and woman). A society in which abortion will not be an option, both by law and by choice. Also, the so-called drama of single mothers in Latin America is much less widespread than in developed countries, the vast majority of children are born into married families.\n \n Concernig homosexual rights, I must say they currently have absolutely no place in Latin American political debate. On one side, because homosexual \"revindication\" is a First World phenomenon, where homosexuals have more power and influence. And also, more importantly, because we simply have more important things to deal with in government and politics, urgent matters dealing with fundamental rights to education, shelter, work, etc. Also, the argument one of your articles states, that Latin Americna political leaders want to exclude homosexuals from citizenship, is ridiculous and clearly shows that many of these articles (despite brandishing impressively convenient statistics) are gravely out of touch with the true social reality of Latin America, as I referred to in the paragraph about abortion and family issues.\n \n With respect to Peru, and the many examples given of that country, Fujimori might sound ever so progressive to you, but he was also a disgustingly corrupt and immoral leader, that stole billions of dollars from the Peruvian people. By the way, I think his idea of vasectomies and tubal ligations to stop population increases is abhorrent and, yes, very comparable to the Final Solution presented by the Nazis.\n \n Fujimori (like all Latin American populists) also spoke a lot about expanding the armed forces, building roads to the isolated villages in the Andes, providing for a universal schooling and health system, etc., etc., etc. And yet, he did nothing of the sort, he only stole from the State and the People. Here's some advice for when you cite Latin American presidents and presidential candidates, Simone: NEVER believe them. Our political systems are corrupt and underdeveloped, and they cannot be correctly compared or treated similarly to yours. In reality, many of the statements Fujimori made about women's rights were simply populist harangues to keep the people at bay while he did what he liked (evidence of this is his repeal of many labour laws while he simultaneously spoke of the dignity of the Peruvian worker). The vast majority of political leaders in Latin America have no interest in solving the issues they speak of, this is what populism is: to manipulate masses of illiterate and/or ignorant peoplw with soothing words and quick political solutions to urgent problems. Fujimori's address of the women's rights issues were simply a way to get votes.\n \n With respect to the debate on gender, I must side with the Church. To say that the roles of feminine and masculine are simply socially and culturally fabricated constructs, with no direct relation with biological bases is outrageous and illogical. To deny the relationship between femininity and masculinity with biological sexuality is scientifically myopic and logically incoherent. And to use a concept like gender to further ideas against family values is simply manipulative.\n \n Having said all this (and I am aware this is very long), I must say that you cannot simply brandish convenient statistics and a list of repetitive articles to say that the problems of a region of 400 million people with such cultural and historical richness, are simply a direct result of this or that circumstance. Catholicism is deeply entrenched in Latin America, but its influence and light have little to do (directly or otherwise) with abhorrent and gossly un-Catholic practises like domestic violence or the \"suppression of women\". The problems and social issues we face are integrated into a very complicated and confusing series of historical tendencies and events and cultural clashes that form a society like ours, which has many good and many bad sides to it. I acknowledge the existence of these problems, but I will not acknowledge an unprofessional simplification of my society and culture to explain them, especially when the religion I profess is unjustly blamed.",

I was confronted with the problem when Cathy, a 'good Christian woman', knocked on my door and asked me to help her. Thinking that her husband was drinking too much she went to a tavern to ask him to come home; his response w\u00e1s to beat her in the parking lot so severely that she was taken to the emergency ward, where the doctor, whom she had never met, asked 'What did you do to provoke him this time?'. This case and many similar episodes led to my legislative work in Wisconsin as a member of the Battered Woman Task Force. It was in this capacity that I began to suspect a strong connection between Christian upbringing and the acceptance of battering by women and men. In particular, a strongly worded letter from a rural Wisconsin woman accused me of sinful ways in trying to urge women to leave a battering situation; as she put it, it was woman's God-given duty to submit to her husband and to suffer in silence as a good Christian woman. I was motivated to discover how this woman had received such a message from her Christian education: that is, that for the sake of keeping the family together, a woman had to sacrifice her own safety and that of her children. Furthermore, the wife who is battered is made to feel the cause of this abuse, and-like the guilty Eve-shares the guilt that accrues to all women from the verses of Genesis. \n",

   "Tertullian:\n \n \n.... the case of Tertullian. The woman is in his eyes a public menace. The man has everything to fear from her, and the first Adam would have done well to be wary about her. The eye with which he looks at her is singularly critical, and not only in De cultu. No occasion is lost to show her vain, conceited, sensual, frivolous, avid and at the same time stupid and cunning. Thus De virginibus velandis (XVII, 1) where one sees the women satisfying the obligation to wear a veil by perching a small handkerchief on the top of the bun so that everyone can judge during the mass the beauty of their hair. Thus De pallio (IV, 2) where the properly female activities of Achilles disguised as a woman consist in \"deploying her dress, to construct the edifice of her hair, to prepare the skin, to consult her mirror, to embellish her neck, to effeminatize even her ear by boring it\", nothing more! \n \n In Ux. II, 8, 3 the vanity (ambitio, muliebris gloria) stigmatized in Cult., I, 2, 1 reappears, together with the interested calculation and the greed which push the woman of De cultu to trample on every human feeling (she does not recoil before the sufferings of the miners who extract the precious metals. I, 5) and even Christians: by decorating herself with the gem which one finds in the face of the dragons, she does not hesitate to borrow her ornament from the Serpent of which she should be the hereditary enemy (I, 6, with a skilful juggling act by Tertullian which assimilates for the occasion the Serpent of Genesis to the more or less fabulous dragons of the Natural History of Pliny).\n \n Ambition and cupidity are besides, with sensuality - object of constant warnings -, the principal reasons which push a woman to be married. What she wants in Ux., I, 4, 6-7, it is \"to dominate over the house of others, to appropriate the wealth of others, to extort from others that which she lacks herself, to spend without counting a money of which one does not feel the loss\". \n \n This woman, finally, is stupid enough to scorn the real good and to allow herself to run after shiny things (for example gold and money, much less useful in the practical life than iron and bronze: Cult., I, 5; or the pearl which is only a disease of the mollusc: I, 6, 2). Her limited intelligence does not enable her to consider sensibly the relative value of things (I, 7,1; 9, 1; II, 10, 2): she hoards stupidly objects which are ignored elsewhere because they are in abundance. But she is at the same time cunning enough to ruin the man whom the devil had not even dared to attack (I, 1, 2). She knows how to adjust the divine law skilfully so that she can present herself to God while making herself fair or russet-red when it is written in the Gospel that no one cannot change a black hair into white or vice versa (II, 6, 3) and she finds an easy way not to contravene the words of the scripture: \"Nobody can add to his size\" by bunching the buns of false hair behind instead of above her head.\n\n http://www.tertullian.org/articles/turcan_etre_femme_eng.htm",

We've gone past that.\nAh, but who is this Mary?\n \n I was thoroughly fascinated by a recent article in Catholic Digest, Why Is May Mary's Month? Within the wider world the month of May has been traditionally the month of the goddess, after all it is named after the goddess Maia, spouse of the war god Mars and one of the manifestations of the earth goddess, and another goddess, Flora, of flowers and spring. So, associating the virgin queen Mary with the month of May is a Roman Catholic attempt to marginalize the older traditions and offer up the pallid, nonsexual, barely human Mary in her stoney image as a replacement for the lively, dancing, jubilant, very sexual and fruitful goddesses of old. Indeed, a portrait of Mary accompanies the article--even though I called the publisher of Catholic Digest they were unable to identify the artist, although I believe the portrait to be a century or two old.\n \n Let us examine this image of Mary. The tones are all of subdued umber, although a paler ocher serves as background for Mary, suggesting a halo. Mary is clothed in tones of umber, her skin is grayish white, very pale, just a wee hint of rose, her eyes modestly down cast, her prim little mouth pursed in disapproval and the angle of her chin indicates wilfulness and disapproval of her viewers. She is the holiest of the holiest and we are but foul, evil humans consumed with lust. Of course, I cannot imagine her image as presented eliciting anything like lust from a male-type person.\n \n Yes, a very deficient substitution for the life-filled goddesses of old.",

   "Dear Maximus, God needs to revise this particular law:\n \nThe fact is, as experience shows, that new life is not the result of each and every act of sexual intercourse. God has wisely ordered laws of nature and the incidence of fertility in such a way that successive births are already naturally spaced through the inherent operation of these laws.\nIf God were truly so gracious and naturally spaced births served both the world and individual families, why is overpopulation so oppressive? Why are people herded about and starving to death in Darfur? Is this part of God's divine plan? I cannot understand the intent of God's plan in light of the situation in Darfur and elsewhere. To cause such unholy suffering? Does God delight in this?\n \n But, kudos to the Vatican in forbidding marital rape:\n \nMen rightly observe that a conjugal act imposed on one's partner without regard to his or her condition or personal and reasonable wishes in the matter, is no true act of love, and therefore offends the moral order in its particular application to the intimate relationship of husband and wife. \nOne wonders if all Catholic men in the world are aware of this little statement.\n \n Am I to understand that there is no exception to save the life of woman whose pregnancy threatens her life?:\n \nWe are obliged once more to declare that the direct interruption of the generative process already begun and, above all, all direct abortion, even for therapeutic reasons . . .\n\n \n Oh, that all priests truly valued the virtue of chastity:\n \nWe take this opportunity to address those who are engaged in education and all those whose right and duty it is to provide for the common good of human society. We would call their attention to the need to create an atmosphere favorable to the growth of chastity so that true liberty may prevail over license and the norms of the moral law may be fully safeguarded.\nParicularly in regard to children and youth. . .",

For it is your principal duty-We are speaking especially to you who teach moral theology-to spell out clearly and completely the Church's teaching on marriage. In the performance of your ministry you must be the first to give an example of that sincere obedience, inward as well as outward, which is due to the magisterium of the Church. For, as you know, the pastors of the Church enjoy a special light of the Holy Spirit in teaching the truth. . . .\n\n \n And his concurrent exhortation to the sheep of the church:\n \n. . . . Husbands and wives, therefore, when deeply distressed by reason of the difficulties of their life, must find stamped in the heart and voice of their priest the likeness of the voice and the love of our Redeemer. . . .\nIt must be quite troubling to the sheep when their little lambs are violated, witness recent history in Boston and the downfall of Cardinal \"Law.\" The good Cardinal actually didn't fall very far, inasmuch as the Vatican held out the trusty Vatican safety-net for fallen Cardinals.",

   "I would still be interested in hearing simone's thoughts. My thought process is that simone looks up and down and all around for the bad examples of Christianity. She never seems to look to the good examples, the prime example being the alpha and omega of the religion, Jesus. It's like choosing a vocational tech business school instead of Harvard Business School. It's like choosing your doctor from the worst of the worst malpractice list. It's like choosing a money launderer for your banker, or Kenneth Lay as your CEO of the year. Look past everyone involved in Christianity, look to Jesus. Rely on him if he is the only one that is trustworthy and secure. Look to his Word, his example, his love--the Way, the Truth, and the Life.",
