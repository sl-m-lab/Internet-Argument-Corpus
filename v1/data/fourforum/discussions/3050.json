   " Feds: Israel Has Top Level Spy In Pentagon\n \n the FBI is pursuing leads identifying a high-placed Zionist spy at the upper reaches of the Pentagon decision-making echelon. They believe the spy attempted to influence US policy against Iraq and Iran. The FBI is believed to have evidence that the spy passed classified material -- including secret Presidential discussions on Iran policy -- to Mossad, through the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), the powerful lobby organization. The alleged spy was embedded as \"a trusted analyst\" tasked with aiding in the development of America's \"Iran policy.\"\n \n The suspected spy, according to CBS, had close relationships with leading neocon Jews at the Pentagon -- Paul Wolfowitz and Douglas Feith -- known as leading \"right-wing\" proponents of Bush's war on Iraq, with nearly pathological Zionist prejudices.\n \n Full article:\n \n http://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=3659\n \n \n This is not the first time that spies from Israel have been busted! Shortly after 9/11, the largest spy ring ever uncovered was busted...yet our media hardly mentioned this story. Doesn't that make you wonder why?!!\n \n The Israeli Spy Ring of 2001\n \n Prior to 9/11, the FBI had discovered the presence of a massive spy ring inside the United States run by the government of Israel. This seems a harsh gratitude from a nation which obtains 10% of its annual budget from the American taxpayer, $3+ billion a year. Over the years, American taxpayers have been required to send Israel more than four times what the US spent to go to the moon.\n \n Full article:\n \n http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/spyring.html\n \n \n Massive Israeli Spy Ring Linked to Sept. 11\n \n There is strong evidence Israeli intelligence operatives engaged in clandestine dealings on American soil and almost certainly had advance knowledge of the impending terrorist attacks on Sept. 11. Israel, however, did not report this information to the American authorities.\n \n Full article:\n \n http://www.americanfreepress.net/03_10_02/Massive_Spy_Ring/massive_spy_ring.html\n \n White Racialist David Duke Takes the Mask Off Jewish Spying\n \n Israeli agents and American traitors have led America into foreign entanglements and aggression that now make us the target of terrorism.\n \n Israel would not even exist except for the billions of American tax dollars that have flowed to it, and yet Israeli treachery against our nation continues without pause. Long after the attack on the USS Liberty; Israel has continued to betray us with spies such as Jonathan Pollard. Many American CIA officials have testified that Pollard and Israel did more direct harm to the security of the United States than any other spy case in history.\n \n Some members of this Israeli spy ring had for many months shadowed half of the 9-11 hijackers as well as the hijacker leader, Mohammed Atta. Five of these Israeli spies were so closely watching Mohammed Atta that they actually lived on his same street in Hollywood, Florida.\n \n Full article:\n \n http://www.davidduke.com/radio/transcripts/stateoftheunion02102003.htm\n \n \n The Real Causes of the 911 Attack\n \n In the year and one half before 911, Israel invaded America with the largest foreign spy ring ever uncovered in American history. Over 200 Israeli operatives were arrested by the United States Government both preceding and in the aftermath of 9/11. These Jewish spies had targeted hundreds of US officials, many U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agents, military officers and military installations, Justice Department officials and even judges. Even more importantly, they had closely monitored most of those suspected of being the 911 hijackers, including the leader of the WTC attack Mohammed Atta. Five of the Israeli spies identified by a U.S. Government report were so closely monitoring Atta that they actually lived on the same street in Hollywood, Florida. These Israeli agents were revealed to have Israeli Mossad and military backgrounds and repeatedly flunked lie detector tests administered in the aftermath of the 911 catastrophe. Instead of being prosecuted for their crimes, the Israeli spies were allowed to return to Israel, even the Israelis who were wire-tapping and monitoring the hijackers. Traitors in our government let these spies go because prosecuting them would have been so damaging to American support for Israel. These spies were released even though they had extensive knowledge of the al Qaeda terrorist network that operated in the United States.\n \n Full article:\n \n http://www.davidduke.com/radio/transcripts/oneyearlater911.htm\n \n \n \n \n .",

   "AIPAC: Still Spying, Still Tax Exempt\n \n FBI RAIDS HEADQUARTERS OF ISRAELI LOBBY\n \n The FBI has raided the national offices of AIPAC, the American Israel Public Affairs Committe. AIPAC is the most powerful lobby in the United States and is controlled by Jewish supremacists who put the interests of Israel over America.\n \n Few Americans even realize that the most powerful lobby in the halls of the American government is on behalf of a foreign nation: Israel! This lobby with allegiance to a foreign power has a hammerlock over the political establishment through the carrot and stick approach. If a Congressman goes along with the billions of dollars of American giveaways to Israel, he receives large campaign contributions from AIPAC and many numerous Jewish organizations.\n \n If an elected official balks at putting Israel ahead of true American interests, or if he even makes the slightest verbal criticism of Israel, not only will he receive no more support, he will be put on a political hit list and his opponents will be lavishly funded and supported. AIPAC can also muster the many influential Zionists in the media to besmirch the patriotic American and promote his AIPAC-puppet opponent. This has happened to many. James Moran, D-VA, and many other public officials have faced their wrath.\n \n Continued:\n \n http://www.davidduke.com/index.php?p=166\n \n \n \n .",
