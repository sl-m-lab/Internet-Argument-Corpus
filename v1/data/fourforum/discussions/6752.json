   "What kind of guitar do you prefer electric or acoustic?\n I say Electic because with electric you have a choice if you want a clean sound or a distorted rockn' soud. Rock n' Roll has to be the best kind of music! And I'm not talking about this modern rock I mean Ac/Dc, Spiderbait, Guns N' Roses you get the idea. Although I give those new rock bands some credit I mean it has to be hard to make a living from Rock when MTV is completely killing it. \n \n ROCK ON! \n emoticon_xagree",

   "More often than not, I would choose to hear an electric guitar. Acoustic is okay but it has been really hard for me to get into listening to Acoustic. However, I have gradually gotten into the whole idea of listening to an acoustic guitar. I think it was that I hear acoustic and I think of folk music. By folk music, I'm referring to the style of Bob Dylan. Now I have no problem with Bob Dylan. He doesn't exactly have the best voice but if you are able to understand the words, he is a good musician. (He is also one artist that I can impersonate.:)) Now I would say that I can take acoustic but I think what made it hard for me to really catch on is (thinking of folk music) is that it seemed that the music was soooooooo sloooooooow.\n A specific album I'm thinking of right now is Bruce Springsteen's Nebraska. That album, besides him singing, was just acoustic guitar and harmonica. And where I'm usually a big fan of the Boss, that was such a hard album to get into. But there's other songs that are on acoustic guitars by the Boss that I like and didn't realize that it was acoustic. So I guess it's more of a genre that I didn't like as apposed to the guitar.\n But down to business, I do prefer electric over acoustic. And that is purely personal taste at this point in time. But both can be hooked up to an amp.emoticon_cool\n \n Wait, are you referring to actually playing or just listening to? Because if you're referring to actually playing, then I have to say skip this 'cause I'm going with air guitar.",

   "I have a preference for electric guitars. As a little kid I remember the neighbor coming over one Saturday night with a Fender electric and a Sears Silvertone amp. It was magic. I was supposed to be asleep upstairs but instead I sat on the steps taking in the wonderful sound. I knew I would be a guitar player someday. \n \n Chet Atkin's great body of work is a testament to the versatility and sounds capable in an electric guitar. During his early period in the '50's he used a D'Angelico guitar. You can hear it here. This guitar was wonderfully clean with great sustain. (Incidentally, he recorded that whole album in one day. That's what we cats call being in the groove.) \n \n In the 60's to the '80's began his wonderful association with Gretsch. For most of that period he recorded with his legendary 1959 Gretsch Country Gentleman. A sweeter sounding guitar has never been captured on tape.\n Here's an album that captures that wonderful sound, and is in the Christmas spirit. \n \n In the acoustic realm, he recorded a lot with a DelVecchio. It is a Brazilian guitar with a built in resonator. I frankly never cared for the sound. It has a harsh metallic tone, IMO. Though he said it was his favorite to play, it and most other DelVecchios are plagued by poor workmanship and, if I remember, the company has gone out of business. Scroll down on this album and select \"Theme From Love Story\" for a listen to the DelVecchio.\n \n My favorite guitar, the one I'll never part with, is a 1968 Gretsch Country Gentleman.",
