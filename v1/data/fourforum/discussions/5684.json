She accused President Bush of \"lying,\" and said that \"hard work\" is \"not jumping in the grave\" with a deceased son. Would any major paper print such words? Or are they failing to reflect the growing anger in Middle America about this war? \n \n By Ned Stafford \n \n \"Cindy Sheehan of Vacaville, Calif., accused President Bush of lying to the nation about a war which has consumed tens of billions of dollars and claimed more than 1,700 American lives -- including the life of (her son) Army Specialist Casey Austin Sheehan. ...\n \n \"Sheehan ridiculed Bush for saying that it's 'hard work' comforting the widow of a soldier who's been killed in Iraq: 'Hard work is seeing your son's murder on CNN one Sunday evening while you're enjoying the last supper you'll ever truly enjoy again. Hard work is having three military officers come to your house a few hours later to confirm the aforementioned murder of your son, your first-born, your kind and gentle sweet baby. Hard work is burying your child 46 days before his 25th birthday. Hard work is holding your other three children as they lower the body of their big (brother) into the ground. Hard work is not jumping in the grave with him and having the earth cover you both,' she said ...\n \n \"'We're watching you very carefully and we're going to do everything in our power to have you impeached for misleading the American people,' she said, quoting a letter she sent to the White House. 'Beating a political stake in your black heart will be the fulfillment of my life ... ,' she said, as the audience of 200 people cheered.\"",

I'm also seeing an increase in letters to the editor with negative opinions of our Iraq presence in our small town newspaper. I'm not seeing any of the formerly common praises of democracy at work in Iraq, nor what were also common military PR articles after several high ranking US military figures stated we can't win against 'insurgents' in Iraq with military force. Combined with polls showing public dissatisfaction with congress, the war and the administration, maybe the general public is finally figuring out that they've been scammed with Iraq.

A lot of those are from insurgents.\n\n \n Iraqbodycount.net only counts deaths if they are reported in 2 or more of a selesct list of media sources. That is nowhere near the total, nor do they represent it as such. The project was started at the beginning of the war due to the fact that the US was unwilling to allow anybody to attempt to place a total on civilian deaths in Iraq. Now ther ehave bene 2 different surveys done in Iraq and both came to roughly the same number (when adjusted for time period). Current civilian deaths (civilian only, no insurgents) are considered to be right around 130,000\n \n \nWe've uncovered 300,000 in mass graves that were killed before we invaded. How are we outkilling Saddam?\n\n \n No, we have not. Go back and re-read your links. We haev uncovered roughly 5000 people in mass graves, executed by saddam. We have only found 40 sites, but believe there may be as many as 270.\n \n Allawi says that saddam killed over a million and put them in mass graves (whisch is impossible). Human rights watch is the group that estimated the number at 300,000. They basically pulled the number out of their butt. Until the numbers are actually in, conjecture is premature.\n \n On the other hand, even if we assume that the high number (300,000) is correct, lets say that was over the course of 20 years (not unreasonable).\n \n 300,000/20= 15,000 deaths per year.\n \n Now, lets igbnore the fact that over half a million Iraqi children died becuase of our sanctions and JUST look at civilian casualties in the current conflict. E will use the lower survey number of 100,000 in 2 yrs.\n \n 100,000/2=50,000 \n \n Whoops, we are beating saddam by a LONG shot.

   "Another opinion", 
   "Does anyone know what percentage of the estimated Iraqi casualties are insurgents and what percentage are innocent civilians? Also, how many of those innocent civilians were killed by the insurgents themselves as opposed to being killed by our forces? \n \n My main concern would be for those civilians that are killed by our forces. Regarding cilivilans killed by insurgents, it is the insurgents that should take the blame for those that they kill, not us. As for the Iraqi insurgents that have been killed, that is an unavoidable consequence of war.\n \n I agree with other posters that we did not have sufficient justification in launching our invasion. However, now that we have invaded, we have a responsibility to \"clean up our mess\" and try to get Iraq into some stable - hopefully more democratic state before we pull out. \n \n Also, I really do not believe that our intentions were ever as dark as some would believe. I get the impression that the main reason that the insurgents continue to fight us is that they believe that we are out to colonize or exploit their country (along the lines of Israel's take-over of the Palestinian lands) and even attack and destroy Islam itself. I certainly do not think that our motives are pure and that no exploitation will occur. However, I have seen no evidence to show that our motives are nearly as dark as these insurgents seem to believe.",

   "poor Daewoo.\n i'll be nicer to you, i promise.\n \n 1. never claim i can read arabic, as you did (and that was debunked). i linked to see if you could. the page was translated for me ;). your translation was just generalities and missed the key threads. and those post that got deleted because you threw a hissy fit and threatened me. or was it a seizure that caused selective memory lost regarding the incident?\n \n 2. i know medical statistics. the lancet article was a P o S. if you had you would know that too. \n 2a.for example, you would have understand that when you report a 95% confidence interval of 8k -194k, that you do not take the mean of that range. that there were just 8k killed is as likely as 194k. basically that you have a 95% certainty that the truth lies somewhere within (not necessarily between) that range. get it? the statistic lesson is free btw. \n 2b. here is where the methods used for verification.\n \nWithin clusters, an attempt was made to confirm at least two reported non-infant deaths by asking to see the death certificate. Interviewers were initially reluctant to ask to see death certificates because this might have implied they did not believe the respondents, perhaps triggering violence. Thus, a compromise was reached for which interviewers would attempt to confirm at least two deaths per cluster. Confirmation was sought to ensure that a large fraction of the reported deaths were not fabrications. Death certificates usually did not exist for infant deaths and asking for such certificates would probably inflate the fraction of respondents who could not confirm reported deaths. The death certificates were requested at the end of the interview so that respondents did not know that confirmation would be sought as they reported deaths. We defined infant deaths as deaths happening in the first 365 days after birth. Violent deaths were defined as those brought about by the intentional acts of others.\n\n \"attempt to\"? LOL. now that's the scientific method at work!\n \"2 verification per cluster\"? that's statistically sound! no where in the article does sit say 80% death certificate verification. care to point that part out for me? there were 33 clusters, so 66 confirmations (if the got that much through their \"attempts\") makes 80%? new Daewoo math?\n since you seem to know so much about it, you must have a copy of the article, right? if not, let me know and i will post the pdf of the article.\n \n 3. what US estimates have put the civilian deaths at 100k? link? oh sorry. my bad. you don't believe in links, its much easier to fabricate. wanna talk DAWA? LOL\n 3a. here, let me help you out, i am being nicer afterall. Iraq Living Condition Survey 2004. there are 3 pdf link at the bottom. choose the 2nd and go to page 55.\n \nWar-related deaths - between 18,000 and 29,000\n The number of deaths of civilians and military personnel in Iraq in the aftermath of the 2003 invasion is another set of figures that have raised controversy. The ILCS data indicates 24,000 deaths, with a 95 percent confidence interval from 18,000 to 29,000 deaths. The confidence interval was estimated using a linearisation technique (using SPSS Complex Samples, version 12).\n \n Another source (Roberts et al. 2004) estimates the number to be 98,000, with a confidence interval of 8,000 to 194,000. The website \"Iraq Body Count\" (http://www.iraqbodycount.net/) estimates that between 14,619 and 16,804 deaths have occurred between the beginning of 2003 and 7 December 2004 (IBC 2004).\n\n see? that's a reasonable confidence interval of 18k - 29k. \n 3b. Amnesty international? they thought the 2.7 millions or so dead in soviet gulags was equivalent to the zero dead in gitmo! do you have the 95% confidence interval for that study? \n \n 4. by the \"high school kid comment\" you are leaning still on georged's penchant for age/sex/credential's check. but perhaps my initial impression was wrong. that you don't lean on georged, just expounding on his leads?\n \n 5. so yeah, i guess you are so so right that the US is worse than Saddam. keep your tail warm. ;)",

The methodology used int he Lancet study was straight out of the book. Further, it has been vindicated by the rescent release of the Iraq Living Conditions Survey for 2004, which mirrors its results almost exactly and was adminstered by the US. If anything, the only flaw in the lancet survey was in excluding fallujah from their final count, since the death rate there was so high. We now know that the death rate in MANY other parts of Iraq is just as high. The ILCS tried to balance it by giving Baghdad, unquestionably the most controlled section of Iraq, a 3:1 weight advantage, and evn with this, they showed in excess of 98,000 deaths (whihc is essentially the lancet studies number). Additionally, amnesty international has now conducted their own statistiacl modeling survey and came to a slightly higher number....99,000 deaths.\n\n so did the ILCS validate the lancet?\n mirrors almost exactly?\n 24000 is a mirror of 98000?\n ;)\n \n \n 6. here is something to consider.\n \nGet your facts first, and then you can distort them as much as you please.\n\n \n 7. i've no problem with being considered a teen. it makes whopping your distortions even more entertaining. besides, judging by your ability to interpret anything on your own as demonstrated in this thread, as well as others, calling me a 16 years old hardly means much. \n \n quite entertaining you are to me.",

Is it the clustering methodology used? The exact methdology used in the lancet survey was developed by the US government for use in kosovo. It is your basic clustering survety, right out of the book and with no anomolies or modifications. \n \n The UNDP survey was for an 12 month period while the lancet survey was for an 18 month period. Additionally, they did not break the data down the same. If you extrapolate using the UNDP survey results, you end up with a number 20% higher than the lancets number (which is 98,000........as I have pointed out before, probability mechanics dictate that a bell shaped curve be applied to the CI.). \n \n I think it is higher because, also as I have pointed out before, they excluded fallujah as a high outlier, but did not exclude their low outlier. Logic would dictate that since they felt compelled to exclude fallujah apparently because the war was especially harsh there, they should have excluded their low outlier because the war barely touched that area. I have not hashed through the numbers (just got back from a long weekend fishing) but I would strongly suspect that if you exclude the low outlier on the lancet survey, you would get a comparable number to the one you extrapolate from the ILCS. As far as I can tell, that is the only problem with the lancet study. Probably best not to dwell on it from your point of view.\n \n \nso did the ILCS validate the lancet?\n mirrors almost exactly?\n 24000 is a mirror of 98000?\n ;)\n\n \n Go back and read it again.\n \n \n \n7. i've no problem with being considered a teen. it makes whopping your distortions even more entertaining. besides, judging by your ability to interpret anything on your own as demonstrated in this thread, as well as others, calling me a 16 years old hardly means much. \n \n\n \n Or a mildly retarded adult with severe developmental problems.\n \n You have not \"whopped\" anything.
