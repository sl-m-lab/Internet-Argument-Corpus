The coalition later acknowledged its operation and did not dispute that up to 19 people might have been killed.\n ...\n Among the dead were two children and a woman, and the bodies were charred, hospital officials said. Two wounded women were taken to hospitals in Baghdad and Ramadi.\n\n \n http://vancouver.indymedia.org/news/2004/09/161343_comment.php\n \nAmbulance torn apart in Fallujah as US launches 'precision' strikes\n Dr Adel Khamis of the Fallujah General Hospital said at least 16 people were killed, including women and children, and 12 others were wounded. Video film showed a Red Crescent ambulance torn apart by an explosion. A hospital official said the driver, a paramedic and five patients had been killed by the blast.\n \n The US air force has claimed repeatedly since the invasion of Iraq in March last year to be hitting hostile targets identified by US intelligence. During the war it made 50 air strikes to kill senior members of Saddam Hussein's regime some of which caused many civilian casualties. Only after the war did US Defence officials admit that all the air strikes had missed their target. On Sunday US helicopters fired rockets into a crowd in Haifa Street in central Baghdad killing 13 people including an Al-Arabiya television correspondent killed as he was reporting.\n\n video:http://www.thenausea.com/elements/usa/iraq%202004/09/2004%2009%2012%20Baghdad%20Haifa.wmv\n \n \n http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5911852/\n \nThe U.S. military has not reported overall Iraqi deaths. \n The Iraqi Health Ministry started counting the dead only in April, when heavy fighting broke out in Fallujah and Najaf. However, conservative estimates by private groups place the Iraqi toll at at least 10,000.\n \n \"It is difficult to establish the right number of casualties,\" said Nicole Choueiry, Middle East spokeswoman for Amnesty International, the human rights watchdog group. \"It was the job of the occupation power to keep track of the numbers, but the Americans failed to do so.\"\n\n \n http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/10/30/sprj.irq.modsue/index.html\n \nIraqi family may sue over bombing\n LONDON, England -- An Iraqi family living in Britain is considering suing the Ministry of Defence (MoD) after losing 10 relatives in a bomb attack in southern Iraq. \n\n \n http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/story.jsp?story=561410\n \nAmbulance torn apart in Fallujah as US launches 'precision' strikes\n \"The conditions here are miserable - an ambulance was bombed, three houses destroyed and men and women killed,\" said Rafayi Hayad al-Esawi, the director of the hospital. \"The American army has no morals.\"\n \n The US air force has claimed repeatedly since the invasion of Iraq in March last year to be hitting hostile targets identified by US intelligence.

He said abuses against Iraqi civilians were partly the result of \"leaders of a country, leaders of an alliance\" constantly referring to them as the \"enemy ... rather than treating them as people\". This attitude was inevitably adopted by some soldiers on the ground, he said.\n \n \"Either it was a war to liberate the people of Iraq, in which case there was gross incompetence, or it was simply a cynical war that was going to happen anyway to vent some form of anger on Saddam Hussein's regime with no regard to the consequences on the Iraqi people.

We made it two blocks intot eh city and were stopped dead, then were actually pushed back a block. We shot from heavily fortified positions for the next 2 weeks, then tried to send some guys sneaking in. they were cut off, and it was apparent that we would not be seeing them again. We arranged a cease fire and pulled all our people out and ringed the city, then eventually gave control to a former general from saddams army, who (to nobodies great surprise) is apparently not doing anything about the insurgents and is apparently aiding them (odd how saddams old budies are suddenly looking like good rulers).\n \n Now, with support of the insurgents growing, a full scale civil war seeming likely, and the war becoming less and less popular back home, we are desperate to try something, anything to slow down the insurgents before things really get out of hand.",

   "Few people recognize the contribution Iraq makes in maintaining the administration's fragile positive GDP numbers (if you can call fractions of a point positive). Taking just the increase in oil costs alone, primarily due to our ME activity, over the past year (32%) away from GDP transactions would have brought greater public focus on the economy, the very issue that defeated Bush Senior's re-election bid. Record expansion of government, record government expenditures, oil and direct costs in Iraq have all kept that number positive. \n \n Kerry's camp would face the same issues. Immediately pulling out of Iraq would probably make him a one-term president just from the domestic economic impact. The 2-3mm barrels/day of oil from Iraq wouldn't be much of a factor, but a raging civil war next to the Sauds and Turkey would certainly make oil prices interesting.\n \n Either way, we're not going to have this mess out of our hair in the near future. It still comes back to how long we can service our exploding public debt and absorb massive trade imbalances in a declining service economy without the dollar going into free fall.

I agree with everything else you said, however you underestimate the ill will against bush in the rest of the world. there have been many protests in london, paris, etc. and they don't protest america...they protest bush.\n\n \n I'll have to disagree with that. The US prides itself on being a Democratic nation (we're forcing it down Iraq's throat at the point of a gun). We elect our public officials to represent our us and those officials are, in the eyes of the world, America. Terrorists don't attack Bush, they attack our country, as Bush is merely the figurehead accomplishing the desires of all Americans. \n \n The US has seldom enjoyed an image of being warm and benevolent. Part of world animosity toward the US was jealousy of our prosperity, but the larger portion is due to our aggression as a powerful nation. If one starts listing the places we've used our military might because of perceived threats from communism and to champion democracy as the only form of government acceptable to us, it's a very long list.\n \n That image of aggression, due to the low number of Americans who travel outside their own country and their insecurity regarding the unknown ('foreigners') combined with prosperity created the 'ugly American tourist' following WW11. Unfortunately, that sterotype image has a lot of truth in it. To anyone who has frequently traveled outside the US, avoidance of most US tourists becomes an automatic reaction. 'They don't even speak English', 'this place is filthy', 'stupid foreigner' and other endearing phrases are all too common. We actually have a worse reputation than German vacationers, a tough act to follow. \n \n While the image of understanding, helping and forgiving Christians is the image we prefer to project, it doesn't come out that way in our leaders or our very racist populace.",

Our tactics seem to be, in many cases, worse than those of saddam. George was speaking a while back about how we have adopted some israeli tactics, such as starting at the end of a block and using sachel charges and sledgehammers to bore holes through houses all the way down in order to approach combatants under cover (of course, byt he time we get there they have vacated the area, so we have just destroyed a dozen houses for nothing). \n \n We have killed far more civilians in our fisrt year in Iraq than saddam ever managed in a single year, we apparently were torturing people, we are carrying out bombing runs in cities, and we are tossing huge numbers of people in prison without charges (even saddam didn't do this, he couldn't afford to, America has all the money in the world to imprison people on suspicion of whatever). \n \n Of course, we are not using chemical or biological weapons against them like saddam was, but we are getting similar results using our conventional weapons. You may remember the big fuss about saddam attacking the kurds with chemical and bio weapons. Even the highest estimates show only 8000 killed, we did better than that in the first couple months of our invasion. \n \n \n \n \nOMG, I did not know about that one. We have a big job cut out for the US.\n\n \n Keep that in mind when you hear our politicians going on about \"international support\" or using Iraqi oil money to rebuild Iraq. What they are doing is trying to figure out some way to weasel their way out from under the huge bill that we have been hit with. Frankly, it doesn't look to me like the world is going to let them do it. The billions of dollars that have been promised to rebuild Iraq (though there has been less than 200 million actually paid out at this point) is just the tip of the iceberg. Considering all the damage done, I think that a trillion dollars is probably a fair to decent estimate of what total cost is likely to be (that was McCains estimate).

By all accounts, we are building permanent bases, not working on exiting.\n \n Saudi arabia has effectively expelled US troops from its borders. Kuwait and Israel (our other main allies in the region) are both too small to lack the resources to support even a single large US base. Iraq, on the other hand has the resources, infrastucture, and size to support several. Those who have it somehow stuck in their heads that we absolutly must maintain a military presence in the ME have targeted Iaq as the home of our troops there.\n \n This is more or less why we went to war to begin with. Those who argue that the war was primarily over oil are largely incorrect (though the billions we hoped to glean from the Iraqi oil industry were certainly considered). Oil is a great, useless substance. It is great in that it is the only resouce in the ME readily convereted to cash and ther eis no lack of market for it. It is a fairly worthless substance on its own because you cannot ewat it, you cannot drink it, and it makes poor houses (very difficult to get nails to stick). \n \n The \"secure oil supply\" excuse beign passed around is largley a load of bunk. They have oil, and not muxch else, and we are willing to pay big bucks for it. End of story.",

End of story.\n\n \n I have always thought the Iraq was invaded not specifically for its oil but for its strategic location in the ME and its better location for access to central asia. Saudi Arabia is a poor strategic location for land military purposes. Boardering only other Arabic nations it makes for a poor staging area for military action in Iran or former USSR republics believed to be the next major source of oil and gas for the world.\n \n The reasoned I asked about Rummy is that perhaps the US gov is starting to believe that the costs are begining to outweigh benifits, or of course as a lead up to invading Iran.",

Those who have it somehow stuck in their heads that we absolutly must maintain a military presence in the ME have targeted Iaq as the home of our troops there.\n\n \n When the Wolfowitz Doctrine (seemingly the P&P manual for this administration) was established, Saudi Arabia was our large ME military base. After 9/11 the Sauds and the US knew Islamic extremists would target those bases and that presented the definite possibility of disruption of critical Saud oil production. Invading Iraq offered a solution that allowed us the ability to re-establish those bases and refocus the US Public from 9/11, the Afghanistan failure, the refusal by Pakistan to let us hunt Bin Laden in their country and our stumbling economy. And allowed the Sauds to support Islamic fundamentalism with complete freedom. Seemingly a win/win situation for everyone but Saddam. \n \n On paper, it was the perfect solution to a lot of problems. As taught in every war college in the world, like most wars it looked great on paper until the first shot was fired. Then came chaos far beyond even the most negative what-if planning scenarios. The very reasons Bush Senior stated for not invading Iraq after the Gulf War became reality.",

As the importance of that issue to the US public has been submerged with the Iraq refocus, our support of Israel's expansionist policies have become even more pronounced. IMO Bin Laden is letting us expend our resources in Iraq to the fullest extent that opportunity offers him while gaining support in Egypt, Pakistan and other Islamic nations.",

I also think that occupying the second largest oil reserve was also a major reason. Wouldn't it be nice for American/British oil companies to just pump up their own oil from Iraq than buying it from them or OPEC? It sure beats drilling in the open ocean and prospecting in wilderness reserves.
