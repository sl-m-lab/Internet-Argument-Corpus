Is there a larger legal difference?\n\n \n There is a pretty huge difference.\n \n Civil unions aren't nationally recognized, for one thing, since not every state has them. If you travel to a state that does not offer civil unions, then your union is not valid there.\n \n I think there's a problem with dissolving those unions as well.\n \n The big difference, though, are the rights that these unions provide. There are over 1,000 legal protections and rights that marriage provides that civil unions don't. I'll try and find a list of differences.",

   "Civil unions vs. marriage: federal law erases many differences, for now (excerpts)\n \n \nBOSTON -- The difference between the marriage rights that gay couples are seeking and the civil unions that some Massachusetts lawmakers want to give them are potentially vast, touching on almost every aspect of living and dying.\n \n The immediate, practical difference, however, may be nearly nonexistent, due to a 1996 law blocking gay couples from receiving hundreds of federal marriage benefits, including an array of tax breaks and Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, and pension allowances for spouses. \n \n But without being able to call it marriage, gay couples and their advocates argue, they will never have the opportunity to challenge that federal ban in either the legal courts or the court of public opinion.\n \n \"We won't even be able to get in the door to be heard about it,\" said Claire Humphrey, 45, who lives with her partner and two children in the Jamaica Plain section of Boston. \"As we've seen from Vermont, it doesn't even open the discussion.\"\n \n [...]\n \n \"The major distinction is that a couple who is married in a state is married everywhere and will be recognized all over the world,\" said Nancy Polikoff, a law professor at American University. \"But with civil unions, as soon as they go anywhere else, they will notice some major differences.\"\n \n Beyond the letter of the law, advocates say, institutions will be more likely to recognize marriage -- a universally understood concept -- than they would partners joined in a civil union. For instance, a company may feel compelled to give family leave benefits to a married gay employee, even though not required to under the federal law.\n \n \"Doors would open even if theoretically and legally those doors are supposed to be locked, because everyone understands what marriage is,\" said Mary Bonauto, an attorney with Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders, who represented seven Massachusetts gay couples in a landmark case decided in November. \"Civil union takes a lot of explanation.\"\n \n [...]\n \n Civil unions convey only the approximately 350 state benefits of marriage, while marriage would also -- potentially -- convey about 1,000 federal marriage benefits, which many consider essential for financial security.\n \n For instance, partners in federally recognized marriage are guaranteed the right to live out their last days together in the same nursing home room. Partners in civil union are not.\n \n Married couples are married no matter what state they're in. Partners in civil union are not, because only Vermont has something called \"civil unions\" on the books.\n \n A widow is entitled to an array of financial protections, mainly through Social Security, when a spouse dies. The survivor of civil union is not.\n \n Married couples can share ownership of their worldly goods -- homes, cars, salaries -- without paying a cent in taxes. Couples in a civil union cannot, leaving them vulnerable if the partner with the name on the deed dies.\n \n [...]\n \n The differences between marriage and civil unions could become even more stark if the Legislature is allowed to define which benefits are included in civil unions -- as would be allowed under one proposal. Some advocates have said that could lead to a very limited form of recognition. [...]\n",
