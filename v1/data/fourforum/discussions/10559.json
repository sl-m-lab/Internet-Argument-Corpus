   "On this morning's talk shows and on tonight's national news, it is feared that Bush is preparing to militarily go into Iran. What surprises me even more are the senators willing to follow this nucklehead once again into harms way. \n \n The head of the UN asks that the US to tone down the sabre rattling rhetoric with Iran. Will he and \"Connie\" listen? What do you think? History shows he doesn't give a damn what anyone else thinks. \n \n Bush proves every day he'll do what he wants, when he wants and with whom he wants, including invading a country. This is one scary man.\n \n Are you personally willing to share his enthusiasm for going to war again? Have all solutions been exhausted other than military? \n \n Remember, the Iraq war was based on his lies and manipulation of the citizens. http://www.downingstreetmemo.com/ How many more have to be killed or maimed through the poor judgement of this \"president\"?\n \n I'm beginning to wonder whether or not there will be an America when this \"Beaver\" finishes his term. Abraham Lincoln was an intuitive man.",
