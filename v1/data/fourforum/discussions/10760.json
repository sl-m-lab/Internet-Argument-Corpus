He led the local group in the elca's human sexuality study.\n \n \n There is no Scriptural foundation for this persecution, no anti-gay passages in the Bible that the Church professes there are. There have been mistranslations. Check. Persecutions. Check. Bullying on the largest scale. Check. But none of this is set down in the Bible as God's way.\n",

Do you see a pattern anywhere?\n\n \n Well at least you've found a passage that appears to mention homosexuality this time.\n \n Well done.\n \n It seems to be saying that god was punishing them for not worshipping him. It also makes a big deal about the 'burning with desire' bit. Nothing about love. No real description of the 'indecent acts', but then that could be open to interpretation. It also doesn't mention what the 'due penalty of their error' was. It does mention later that people who practice such things are worthy of death (though that may be refering only to those who are guilty of 'unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, evil; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice; {they are} gossips, slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, without understanding, untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful' - nothing about homosexuality there). Are those who are disobedient to their parents really worthy of death? Or those who are arrogant?\n \n Then it says they 'not only do the same, but also give hearty approval to those who practice them'. This suggests to me that they continued to live. So, those who commit those acts are 'worthy of death', and they received 'the due penalty of their error', yet they appear to continue to approve of those who practice these acts.\n \n Wait a minute:\n They did these things (although it was punishment from god - a jealous god - how petty).\n They deserved death.\n They got their due punishment.\n Yet they still lived.\n \n Did god slip up here?emoticon_xdonno \n \n These things are confusing if you really think about them, are they?\n \n Smiley",

Keep getting your bible interpretations from You Tube, see how far that gets you in the end. Haven't I said in almost every post regarding adultery, fornication, lewdness and lascivious sexual immorality, that it applies to straights as well as gays?

But neither do straight men who get caught insist that their sins of the flesh were right and admirable as you gays do. \n \n You defend your lifestyle and insist it is right and normal even though the bible condemns it.

   "I agree that the warning is speaking directly to the last days prophecies found in the book of Revelation. But it should also act as a warning that God wont look kindly on any changes or perversions to His holy word by extension. For example the Book of Mormon is adding to Gods word and I think Jo Smith will pay for the people he has caused to stumble with the eriting and canonization of that book for Mormons.\n\n \n I also think it's important to note that canonization took place under the authority and auspices of apostolic succession. And there were very specific tests for canonicity--they didn't just throw them in there arbitrarily.",

   "And you say you don't worship a God of fear and punishment. The above statement is an exhibit of your belief in an old testament monster that will burn his children. I prove it with you own words.\n\n \n That isn't fear I'm expressing Matt, it's respect for a God who is not only loving and merciful but also JUST. One who will ultimately judge all who reject Him and rebel against His laws. Why are you so one dimensional that you are unable to see the complete picture of Gods character?\n \n \nhttp://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=295736&postcount=51\n\n \n Sorry Matt, I didn't read that post as I don't respond to sanctimonious putz's. In fact you're lucky I even respond to the irrational drivel you dole out so regularly around here, so stop trying to instigate more trouble and worry about how you misinterpret every aspect of life that you try to wrap your mind around.",
