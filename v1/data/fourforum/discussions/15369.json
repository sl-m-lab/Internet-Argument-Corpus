   " This is the tired refrain we often hear from the religiously devout apologists and advocates of capitalism: \"It's unfair to lambaste capitalism with the flaws of our economic system, because our economic system isn't at all true to the core and classic principles of capitalism. If we only had a system that was fastidiously faithful to the philosophy of capitalism then everyone would see what a brilliant and splendorous system capitalism really is.\" \n \n Translation: \"I just want to think and talk about what a lovely, lofty system the \"free market\" is in theory, I don't wish to confront the hard-to-defend reality of the socioeconomic injustice and human wretchedness that masses of working-poor and unemployed people are forced to routinely endure as they struggle to survive under capitalism.\" \n \n The harsh and dehumanizing reality of capitalism, for the information of any free-marketarian ideologue who hasn't been down from his ivory tower lately, is as follows. Firstly, a morally unjustifiable asymmetry in the distribution of wealth, with the result that a predatory and plutocratic few enjoy extreme and opulent affluence while the plebian bulk of humanity suffers moderate to extreme poverty and privation (some literally scrounging in garbage dumps for barely edible foodstuffs to sustain their malnourished bodies). \n \n Secondly, capitalism is an inherently dehumanizing system not merely because it degrades men and women with insulting and infra dig indigence, but because it objectifies them into mere factory robots, and supermarket checker robots, and office worker robots, etc., performing menial and servile tasks that generate revenue for owners. That is, under capitalism human individuals are no longer treated as such, instead they're constrained by the system to accept an existential state of affairs in which they're stereotyped as, related to as, and valued (or disvalued) as their commercial function, their role in the commerce of the market, i.e. their cog-like job in the economic machine . An economic machine that's geared to use people, to turn them into means to the ends, to the profits of their employers. \n \n From a humanistic point of view then, the fundamental and enormous sin of capitalism is that it de-dignifies us into things, things that serve someone else's selfish purposes. And spiritually, this endemic capitalistic thingification and exploitation of working people does us the ultimate injury by alienating us from our own inner creative nature. That is, instead of our economic productivity being experienced as an expression of our indwelling quantum of divine creativity and ingenuity, it's reduced to an exploitable resource that belongs to a boss or corporation - we're effectively estranged from our ultimate nature and immanent godlikeness. It's not at all a rhetorical exaggeration to say that capitalism's commodification of ordinary Joes and Janes into wage-earning chattel excommunicates them from the beatitude of their own personal portion of cosmic creativity, that it condemns us to a spiritually forlorn state of living without a keen conscious sense of Transcendence actualizing itself through our daily constructive activities. \n \n Doesn't this pretty much cover the existential and ethical badness of capitalism? What more can really be said against our system of predaceous and parasitic \"private enterprise\"? Well, there is the underlying primitive alpha dog mentality that capitalism in both theory and practice is predicated upon and promotes. Since I'm engaged in critically slicing through capitalism's bourgeois and Babbittish baloney I'd be quite remiss if I neglected to mention that modern capitalism is just the same old sour and foul-tasting wine of to the strong go all the spoils in new ideological wineskins. \n \n In the grandiose guise of the \"free market\", capitalism gives the ole heave-ho to the last 2,500 years of man's ethical growth and returns us to a system of society in which the only socioeconomic law in operation is the law of the jungle - dominate or be dominated. A system in which individuals are shamelessly unfettered from acting upon their animalistic aspiration to achieve and exercise social dominance over their neighbor. A system in which the brutelike striving for social dominance takes the crass form of economic dominance, and in which economic dominance is reached by ruthlessly and rapaciously reaping the fruits of other people's labors and losses so as to become \"rich\". The modern \"rich man\" is just a Neanderthaloid alpha male (or female) dressed up in a business suit and Rolex watch. The vaunted freedom of the \"free market\" boils down to little more than society granting people the licentious and amoral permission to conduct themselves in an atavistically self-assertive and avaricious fashion. \n \n In other words, social Darwinism decked out as the doctrine of the \"free market\" is the order of the day. Say what?! Well, let me quote the better part of a paragraph here from the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica's article on social Darwinism, \"The theory was used to support laissez-faire capitalism and political conservatism. Class stratification was justified on the basis of \"natural\" inequalities among individuals, for the control of property was said to be a correlate of superior and inherent moral attributes such as industriousness, temperance, and frugality. Attempts to reform society through state intervention or other means would, therefore, interfere with natural processes; unrestricted competition and defense of the status quo were in accord with biological selection. The poor were the \"unfit\" and should not be aided; in the struggle for existence, wealth was a sign of success.\"\n \n You might have noted how the article uses the past tense, as if social Darwinism is a dated worldview that no longer informs the thinking of folks who are pro-capitalist. But in actuality just about all of the backward thinking described above is still very much with us, deeply ensconced in the body of ideas espoused by right-of-center politicos, commentators, and businessmen - by disciples of Reganomics and \"libertarianism\" and all the in-vogue schools of economic thought. For example, believers in laissez-faire capitalism still tend to think in terms of the strong, i.e. of people who enjoy affluence, being superiorly endowed with morally excellent traits such as a stronger work ethic, enterprisingness, thriftiness, etc., which supposedly entitle them to the higher quality of life they enjoy. While the weak, i.e. the poor, the unemployed, and the homeless allegedly lack these good traits and therefore should disappear from our communities into the mendicant margins of society - the next best thing to them literally dying off. \n \n Is this over the top of me? Alas no, according to contemporary conservatives, the weak and inferior, you know, the folks in the lower economic classes, aren't \"entitled\" to anything from society. The very concept of \"entitlements\" is every bit as abhorrent to them as to a classic 19th century social Darwinist. And our latter-day social Darwinists, the conservatives, certainly have no trouble with the class stratification of society - to the conservative mind-set a form of hierarchical society divided into disproportionately empowered socioeconomic classes is quite natural and acceptable. Indeed, rationalizing such an unequal status quo, and unrestricted competition and greed are the hallmarks of conservatism and free-marketarianism. So how exactly has our capitalist society moved beyond the unprogressive social Darwinism of the benighted 1800s?! \n \n It seems that we're just less blunt and boorish about our regressively, cavemanly social-Darwinian attitudes nowadays, but they still fairly distinctly lurk beneath both the economic realities and ideals of our ostensively \"civilized\" world order. This makes for a world order that's hardly kind & gentle, and that in many instances is egregiously cruel and brutal. \n \n Capitalism, it's plain to see, is certainly no utopia at all, though the staunch proponents of its theory tend to be quixotically utopian as far as their temperamental unwillingness and intellectual inability to confront the obvious negativity of capitalism's facts on the ground goes. That capitalism is a socially, morally, and spiritually dismal system in which the majority of mankind is locked into chronic lack and pauperism; is dehumanized and alienated from spiritual and personal authenticity; and has reverted to an uncompassionately Darwinian, downright troglodytic take on economics and society; that all of this is empirically the case, and conspicuously so, doesn't penetrate the clanky, clunky cognitive armor of free-market fanatics and capitalist cultists one bit. \n \n How so?! The intellectually dishonest and facile defense of the conservative booster of a \"free economy\" is to simply reject disconfirming real-world data in favor of the elegance of laissez-faireism, to inanely cling to the psychological safety blanket of ideology in the face of so much human pain. This works well enough to keep Republicans and rich folk cozy in their pro-capitalist creed, but unfortunately it means no measurable change of heart in these dogmatic elitists at the top of the socioeconomic food chain, and no foreseeable altruistically-inspired amelioration of the lot of the average workingperson. Nope, workingpeople can no longer wait for business and political leaders who are invested in keeping the faith in capitalism to give us real change from the top down, we need to begin kicking the system and philosophy of capitalism to the curb of history ourselves, or keep getting our rear ends kicked by it. \n \n \n (Please forgive the lengthy length of this post. Thank you.)\n \n :)",

Wealth is a representation of value, production, not of some arbitrary value, but of society. If you don't think Bill Gates deserves his money, then don't by his software. The people decide the value of any individuals production. More accurately, Bill Gates is rich in a philosophical sense because society values what he does, and wants to motivate other people to do the same. AKA, work hard, think hard, produce. This is ultimate purpose of humans.\n \n Another mistake here is the notion that because wealth is a pie, getting more of it means taking it away from someone else. No one forces you to buy windows, both parties win in the purchase of the product. The consumer gets something useful, the provider gets money, to pay employees, make more product, and grow.\n \nSecondly, capitalism is an inherently dehumanizing system not merely because it degrades men and women with insulting and infra dig indigence, but because it objectifies them into mere factory robots, and supermarket checker robots, and office worker robots, etc., performing menial and servile tasks that generate revenue for owners.\n\n \n Mankind is a collection of machine whose main goal seems to be, increase the value of society to society, increase the size of society, increase knowledge of society.\n \n Again, the relationship between employee, and employee is not forced. It is the same as buying something. You sell your work for money, so you can live better. If your work is worth more to the consumer, you get paid more, and live better. \n \n No matter what, if your dissatisfied with your work situation, strike out on your own, do a leveraged buyout, start a business, move to the wilderness, go back to school, take out a student loan. \n \n \nThat is, under capitalism human individuals are no longer treated as such, instead they're constrained by the system to accept an existential state of affairs in which they're stereotyped as, related to as, and valued (or disvalued) as their commercial function, their role in the commerce of the market, i.e. their cog-like job in the economic machine . An economic machine that's geared to use people, to turn them into means to the ends, to the profits of their employers..\n\n No one told you to be a \"office worker robot,\" no one stereotyped you. You have made that decision on your own. Yes, people have to work, be an economic machine as you put it. As stated before, its a deal between you and your employer, if you don't like the deal, leave.\n \n \nFrom a humanistic point of view then, the fundamental and enormous sin of capitalism is that it de-dignifies us into things, things that serve someone else's selfish purposes. And spiritually, this endemic capitalistic thingification and exploitation of working people does us the ultimate injury by alienating us from our own inner creative nature. That is, instead of our economic productivity being experienced as an expression of our indwelling quantum of divine creativity and ingenuity, it's reduced to an exploitable resource that belongs to a boss or corporation - we're effectively estranged from our ultimate nature and immanent godlikeness..\n\n \n Your creative nature is what is behind work, if you use it effectively, you can live better. Capitalism does not create things out of people, Capitalism says, do the best you can. If you feel like a thing at your work place, then leave. If you think working makes people things, then go live off the land. You are not being restricted.\n \nIn the grandiose guise of the \"free market\", capitalism gives the ole heave-ho to the last 2,500 years of man's ethical growth and returns us to a system of society in which the only socioeconomic law in operation is the law of the jungle - dominate or be dominated. A system in which individuals are shamelessly unfettered from acting upon their animalistic aspiration to achieve and exercise social dominance over their neighbor. A system in which the brutelike striving for social dominance takes the crass form of economic dominance, and in which economic dominance is reached by ruthlessly and rapaciously reaping the fruits of other people's labors and losses so as to become \"rich\". The modern \"rich man\" is just a Neanderthaloid alpha male (or female) dressed up in a business suit and Rolex watch. The vaunted freedom of the \"free market\" boils down to little more than society granting people the licentious and amoral permission to conduct themselves in an atavistically self-assertive and avaricious fashion...\n\n \n To become rich, one need not hurt anyone, deals do not happen when both sides aren't satisfied. Power has nothing to do with it. Generating wealth does not take it from someone else, employees are not slaves, and can't be treated as such. \n \n \nAttempts to reform society through state intervention or other means would, therefore, interfere with natural processes; unrestricted competition and defense of the status quo were in accord with biological selection. The poor were the \"unfit\" and should not be aided; in the struggle for existence, wealth was a sign of success.\"..\n\n \n The problem with state intervention is that it destroys fundamental processes that make the free market work, specifically the price system. The goal of all men, rich or poor, should be to get richer, produce more. You should be happy someone found a way to produce something you, and others value, and you should strive for it yourself.\n \n \n \n \nThis makes for a world order that's hardly kind & gentle, and that in many instances is egregiously cruel and brutal. \n \n \n This works well enough to keep Republicans and rich folk cozy in their pro-capitalist creed, but unfortunately it means no measurable change of heart in these dogmatic elitists at the top of the socioeconomic food chain, and no foreseeable altruistically-inspired amelioration of the lot of the average workingperson.

Thank you.)\n \n :)\n\n \n What would you then purpose? How then should the world work? What are the goals of society? You have gravely misread the situation, and you are not the first. Stalin would agree wholeheartedly with you meaningless rhetoric, Hitler's main philosophy was designed to fix capitalism. Most recently, Keynes has caused the Great Depression, and continues to hurt todays economy. North Korea starves wholesale, while south Korea is well fed. The only reason China is not the same, is because they do not implement Communism in full. The majority of people work for money. Capitalism is as old as fire, every achievement of man past the caveman stage is due to capitalism.",

I don't see the injustice though. It is not the weakness of incompetence of a person that renders them unfit for wealth, it is the fact that someone thinks they deserve it that makes such wealth just regardless of how idiotic a man is.

It is the decision of those involved in any particular transfer what is worth what.\n \n Together these totally negate the idea of reward, punishment, and distribution. The wealth starts out distributed because it starts out in the hands of the producer, capitalism does not gather it all up and then doll it out based on greed.\n \n When you trade with another person capitalism as some kind of disembodied force is not rewarding you or judging your worth, the person you are trading with is judging the worth of the traded items just as you are.

   "I did make the point in the very post that you referred to that all forms of society is and has been unfair but capitalism is the only form of society that recognises and harnesses human nature..this is an important point.\n\n I know, it was the unfair part I was responding to.\n \n \nA society can be seen or defined is just or unjust as a collective and/or by the perception of each individual in it.\n\n I would replace perceptions with beliefs.\n \n \nYou are looking at the collective as a whole and charlesb IMO is projecting a view from the viewpoint of an individual who has not had the full benefit of the capitalist society.\n\n I apologize if it seems like I am trying to justify capitalism based on an overall collective 'good', that was not my intention.\n \n I maintain that it is just for individuals primarily, and since a collective is a group of individuals it is just for all.\n \n Whether or not charleslb has achieved his personal goals in a predominantly capitalist political-economy really doesn't factor into my position, nor does it excuse his. There are many things I still wish to do, things that would be a lot easier if people blindly trusted that I could make it work. I would be insanely... well arrogant to think it was injustice that they don't just start throwing money at me. Arrogant by the way is one of the most misunderstood vices, so often confused with pride, confidence, and certainty as too almost mean nothing. I still understand that it does exist, when one person thinks their opinions are better than others 'because'.\n \n \nI am attempting to justify his view without advocating a change to socialism\n A person born in an underclass will always be at a disadvantage compared with a person born in an elite.\n\n Agreed.\n \n \nBy that fact alone capitalism is unfair.\n\n What is unjust about parents giving their kids the best start in life they can? It's a valid survival strategy. A ban on that would be a thousand times harder to implement than the American prohibition, is contrary to human nature; and most importantly violates the rights of the parents.\n \n \nA community can become wealthy with the majority of the wealth staying with the elite in a capitalist system( it does in all systems but we are discussing capitalism and that is why I asked him for an alternative).\n\n Yes.\n \n \nThis is unfair.\n\n Why?\n \n If the 'elite' didn't produce the wealth and they weren't given the wealth then they must have stolen it, but capitalism is defined to be the absence of theft or fraud. It is like claiming the road is too muddy in the Sahara, one need merely observe that it is quite impossible for there to be that much water.\n \n Abstracting the community is what confuses people. It is not the communities wealth, nor the communities decision in reality we are talking about individuals and organizations of individuals. It is the 'elite's decision and it is the minimum wage factory worker's decision.\n \n How do these 'elite' get their money? People agree they deserve it every time they trade with them. Let the man who is so sure that they do not deserve it stop paying them, it is no defense that if he wants to live comfortably he must. He does not have a right to live comfortably any more than the 'elite' has a right to hire people at a certain wage.\n \n All that capitalism does here is provide no illusion or insulation between people and reality. You stop working you stop eating, you stop going to movies, you stop getting a warm house. That is the nature of standing still in a universe that demands productive action, even in his most primitive state man survived by volitional application of his mind. We can survive without it no better than a fish could on land.\n \n You may ask \"but why the elite? Why doesn't this trade tend to make everyone equal?\". That is where the proposed differences in productive ability come in. Note, and I can't under stress this, that such is the explaination, not the justification. The justification is that regardless of why they have more to trade, they do have more to trade and people consistently recognize that by trading with them.\n \n To ask why, is to ask why a polymath engineer is more essential in building an advanced machine than a gardener. There is an answer of course but the specific answer for every case is irrelevant. What matters is that the whole body of anyone involved in the productive effort of creating an advanced machine agree value him more than the gardener, and that agreement is the justification. That agreement is the only way to satisfy the rights of all those involved. It's these contracts that go flying about capitalism that no one seems to notice anymore that testify to the consensus on the ratio of productive achievement of the individuals involved, that testify to the consensus about what a product's value really is.\n \n Who else but the buyer and seller should make the decisions when their volition is the only moral way to transfer the items?\n \n \nWhat you are saying is that capitalism has framework for people to realise their own potential and the freedom to what they like with the money they acquire and that ( among other attributes) makes capitalism fair.\n\n Well to put it more precisely, you defined fair as just. Objective morality holds that justice exists when the rights of all are respected. A man's potential is his own responsibility, capitalism relies on men having the freedom to cooperate but liberty demands that they must not be coerced to do so.\n \n Is reality unjust? If it is what a joke to use the concept. Yet reality could have a man with the mind of Aristotle or Einstein live as a hunter gatherer and have the sum total of their life's thought amount to a new way to hunt deer.\n \n A man's potential is not really a factor in justice.\n \n \nI am saying that this is not enough to make capitalism fair or just but it is enough to make it the best system yet.\n\n and I am saying, economically; it is the best system conceivable.\n \n In the ideal volitional society people could organize their economy in any way they see fit, limited only by their own cooperation; but I think the actions of all collectivists through the years give testament to the fact that nobody really believes you can have anything but various forms of what we call capitalism unless you force people. That last cannot be done in an ideal society and so I have little faith that they would change. If however I am totally wrong and socialism is compatible with liberty and better than capitalism as we know it. Let them try, I don't have a right to live in a capitalist society even if I have the right to live in a free society.\n \n I again repeat that I don't expect it, people won't sign things that are to their disadvantage and all but the most crazed would refuse to sign away their ability to trade with others when almost everything leftist claim to be after could be achieved without doing so.\n \n \nUnless capitalism allows everyone in society to realise their full potential capitalism cannot be seen as fair .\n\n You seek a realm that does not exist in this universe, for the universe does not allow everyone to realize their full potential.\n \n When you compare capitalism to olympus, Asgard, or heaven yes it does look shabby.\n \n \nThat is not just the chance that someone with wealth will recognise you to be of value but a system that invests a huge amount of its wealth in education, health and housing.\n\n If men will do it, it can be done in my ideal society. What leftist fear above all else is discovering that they have been telling themselves lies; that they can't do what they want unless some people are made to follow their will.\n \n \nThere lies the paradox because the further you move towards this ,the further you move towards socialism and away from capitalism.\n\n Capitalism is a system of free trade; a childishly simple derivation of the concept of liberty to be honest. If societal projects are what you define as socialism, capitalism and socialism are not incompatible.\n \n However if you want to abolish free trade without contradicting liberty, you need to get people to agree to trade only under prescribed circumstances.",

We have not the power to generate wealth out of compassion. What improvement could be had if you violated the rights of the factory owners and forced them to offer a trade that they would not otherwise have agreed to? Or if you had forced prospective workers to do anything else but take the jobs? Nothing but misery would ensue; but on top of misery you would have injustice.\n \n Poverty is subjective, rights are not. Foolish leftist invert all logic and fact on a regular basis. They would have you believe poverty is objective but rights are not. They proceed on the premise that a certain quality of life or a certain amount of wealth is the minimum acceptable. They ignore the fact that the wealth of mankind as well as his average quality of life have been increasing for millennia. Why isn't the minimum what it was for hunter gatherers? It is only in comparison that they define this minimum, and the only thing to support this is the emotion of jealousy.\n \n \nYou must bear in mind that the UK was a small island holding dominion over a huge swathe of the Earth rather than a huge landmass with seemingly endless resources such as the USA was and to a point still is.\n\n Are you saying there was not enough farmland in Britain to feed everyone, and so they had to trade internationally for it? \n \n \nIndonesia,India and now China have exploited their people for cheap labour with the help of the West since the decline of the British empire and people of Africa have been treated like slaves since ancient times.\n If the Rand model of capitalism is explicitly against this kind of exploitation then I look forward to perusing it further.\n\n The Rand model of capitalism holds that capitalism is merely a consequence.

However Rand, and myself are not against everything that is called slavery or exploitation.\n \n This so called 'wage' slavery is a play on words and nothing more. You cannot enslave a man by offering him a job. It sounds to objectivists like a joke, as if an excellent restaurant could enslave you to buy your food there because it is so tasty you can't imagine life without it.\n \n If the alternative to a job is so terrible, so unthinkable that practically no matter the terms you would accept it. I think you should take some time just to appreciate how lucky you are that someone is offering you this trade before you start complaining.\n \n It is analogous to being rescued at sea and then claiming it an injustice that a rundown fishing trawler picked you up instead of a cruise ship. If you had a choice you would make it, but it is not the crew (the companies) fault if they're your best hope.\n \n Why expect them to undervalue your life itself in the trade?",

We have not the power to generate wealth out of compassion. What improvement could be had if you violated the rights of the factory owners and forced them to offer a trade that they would not otherwise have agreed to? Or if you had forced prospective workers to do anything else but take the jobs? Nothing but misery would ensue; but on top of misery you would have injustice.\n \n Poverty is subjective, rights are not. Foolish leftist invert all logic and fact on a regular basis. They would have you believe poverty is objective but rights are not. They proceed on the premise that a certain quality of life or a certain amount of wealth is the minimum acceptable. They ignore the fact that the wealth of mankind as well as his average quality of life have been increasing for millennia. Why isn't the minimum what it was for hunter gatherers? It is only in comparison that they define this minimum, and the only thing to support this is the emotion of jealousy.\n \n \n Are you saying there was not enough farmland in Britain to feed everyone, and so they had to trade internationally for it? \n \n \n The Rand model of capitalism holds that capitalism is merely a consequence. A consequence of holding volition as a societal absolute a.k.a liberty.\n \n As such all fraud, theft, enslavement; or anything else that violates man's rights (his liberty) are explicitly being opposed by objectivist. However Rand, and myself are not against everything that is called slavery or exploitation.\n \n This so called 'wage' slavery is a play on words and nothing more. You cannot enslave a man by offering him a job. It sounds to objectivists like a joke, as if an excellent restaurant could enslave you to buy your food there because it is so tasty you can't imagine life without it.\n \n If the alternative to a job is so terrible, so unthinkable that practically no matter the terms you would accept it. I think you should take some time just to appreciate how lucky you are that someone is offering you this trade before you start complaining.\n \n It is analogous to being rescued at sea and then claiming it an injustice that a rundown fishing trawler picked you up instead of a cruise ship. If you had a choice you would make it, but it is not the crew (the companies) fault if they're your best hope.\n \n Why expect them to undervalue your life itself in the trade?\n\n \n So basically you are saying according to the objectivist model of capitalism any remuneration for labour , no matter how low is morally justified and the that wages of the workers should be regulated only by the highest wages that are offered.\n I would say that if the choice given to a person was poverty or starvation then they are no more than slaves.\n The children of slaves were still slaves..they were not forced by other people\n to be the property of other men but happened to be the product of people who were.The slave still has a choice, they can still refuse to be a slave and suffer the consequences\n Equally the children born of the poor that are offered the same choices as their parents are hardly better off or have more realistic choices than the uncooperative slave.\n How can you differentiate between the two?\n AS for the notion that a man can still live as a Sumerian...well that choice was not offered to the poor either.\n An American could in theory live off the land, go to the wilderness and live off their wits.\n The problem for the British poor was that there was no land available .All the land of the UK is accounted for. I doubt that it would have been tolerated even if land were available.\n The UK poor had about the same choice as a battery chicken that could choose between factories\n I would say a philosophy that justifies or is indifferent to poverty has the seeds its own destruction inside it.",

   "So basically you are saying according to the objectivist model of capitalism any remuneration for labour , no matter how low is morally justified\n\n Precisely, not by our opinion; but by their agreement.\n \n \nand the that wages of the workers should be regulated only by the highest wages that are offered.\n\n They shouldn't be regulated at all, if someone is offering a higher wage you know people will seek it, but those positions may fill up before everyone doing a certain job has one.\n \n \nI would say that if the choice given to a person was poverty or starvation then they are no more than slaves.\n\n You would be wrong. A slaveholder can free their slaves by no longer requiring them to do anything for them.

   "The problem is that the poor would not be happy to tolerate a system whereby they starve or die( if they could possibly overthrow it),whatever and whoever is telling them that it is the ONLY system that is a just one.\n\n You misunderstand. It is not the system that gives them this choice it is reality. The choice just isn't hidden behind the immorality of legalized theft.\n \n If the choice they have with capitalism is death or low wages, and capitalism is a system of free trade where the low wages is trading labor for capital. Then wouldn't their choice without capitalism be death or death?\n \n When people say it is capitalism that offers the 'death' choice they are lying in order to promote a replacement in which another choice will be offered. Death, low wages; or steal it from the someone else.\n \n If a man will not tolerate the liberty of others there can be no justice. If your rejection of capitalism is that we couldn't keep the majority from stealing from the minority, it seems rather pointless to discuss morality.\n \n \nTherefore the objectivist system is doomed by the underclass( instigated by the middle class) that it will inevitably produce. \n\n Capitalism doesn't produce classes, doesn't deal with classes; doesn't care about classes nor does objectivism or any aspect of it's rationale. I and other objectivist speak in these terms because others insist by asking about specific groups.\n \n \nOf course the elite could realise that the underclass could be pacified by being taught a more pacifist philosophy ie Christianity but that in itself would deviate from their own notions of justice.\n\n The 'underclass' could be 'pacified' by teaching them objectivism, which allow them to differentiate jealousy and entitlement from justice.\n \n \nIm starting to think that objectivism is more of a model based on an upper middle class philophist reflections on the US than a viable self regulating society.\n\n It is a model based on man. All men everywhere regardless of their wealth and technology.\n \n \nIt seems to allow its form of capitalism to be vulnerable to socialism rather than steer people away from it.\n\n We (objectivist) are not the ones thinking of people in classes contemplating 'steering', manipulating, or controlling them in any way except by the best power of our arguments.\n \n Now the following 'you' does not necessarily refer to you personally now addressing advocates of capitalism who are not objectivist.\n \n If you would try to inoculate the populous with small amounts of socialism to prevent a revolt, while we would rather convince them with logic and appeal to their highest and most rational judgement; you can expect nothing else out of us but a complete confidence that our way is the honorable and just.\n \n If the cure to immorality is a small amount of immorality something is wrong with your ethical theory. If people believe some amount of theft or enslavement is moral what in the world could make you think that such people are less likely to violate more rights than if they believed no theft of enslavement was moral.\n \n \nOn the other hand perhaps I am applying the unappliable, like saying communism would not work in Victorian Britain only because the upper classes would not like it!!\n\n Rich people don't like communism because they're the victims. 'Poor' immoral people don't like capitalism because there are no victims.\n \n A system which sacrifices the rights of the poor for the rights of the noble or rich no longer exists, it is merely propaganda that tries to paint capitalism as a replacement for feudalism; based only on the fact that wealthy people exist under both systems.\n \n A feudal lord would have just as much objection to communism as a capitalist tycoon would; but where the lord fears he will lose his subjects, the capitalist fears he will lose his property.\n \n I will not believe men cannot behave morally, I refuse to; nor do I see any evidence to the contrary. I believe everyone can think like objectivist, and reject classim on it's foundation. Such a society would be in no danger of a proletariat uprising because no one would see themselves as oppressed 'underclass' or indeed any class.",
