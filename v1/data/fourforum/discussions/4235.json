   "News Releases 02/04/2005 \n Same-Sex Couples Must Be Allowed To Marry In New York, Court Rules; Lambda Legal Says Decision Is 'Historic, Well Reasoned and Fair' \n Lambda Legal brought the case under the state Constitution, saying gay New Yorkers weren't being treated equally under the law because they couldn't marry \n \n (New York, February 4, 2005) - A New York State court ruled today that same-sex couples must be allowed to marry, in a decision that Lambda Legal called \"a historic ruling that delivers the state Constitution's promise of equality to all New Yorkers.\" Lambda Legal filed the lawsuit last year, representing five same-sex couples seeking marriage licenses in New York City.\n \n In a 62-page decision issued this morning in New York City, State Supreme Court Justice Doris Ling-Cohan said that the New York State Constitution guarantees basic freedoms to lesbian and gay people - and that those rights are violated when same-sex couples are not allowed to marry. The ruling said the state Constitution requires same-sex couples to have equal access to marriage, and that the couples represented by Lambda Legal must be given marriage licenses.\n \n \"I was even more moved than I thought I'd be when I heard about this ruling. All of us cried - me, Mary Jo and our 15-year-old daughter. For the first time, our family is being treated with the respect and dignity that our friends, coworkers and neighbors automatically have,\" said Jo-Ann Shain, a 51-year-old New York City resident who is a plaintiff in the case with her partner, Mary Jo Kennedy, 49. \"Last week, Mary Jo and I celebrated our 23rd anniversary together, but we've never had all the protections and rights that come with marriage. We need these protections to take responsibility for each other and for our daughter, and we are enormously grateful that the court saw that and said our family should be treated equally.\"\n \n \"This is a historic ruling that delivers the state Constitution's promise of equality to all New Yorkers,\" said Susan Sommer, Supervising Attorney at Lambda Legal and the lead attorney on the case. \"The court recognized that unless gay people can marry, they are not being treated equally under the law. Same-sex couples need the protections and security marriage provides, and this ruling says they're entitled to get them the same way straight couples do.\"\n \n In today's ruling, Justice Ling-Cohan said, \"Simply put, marriage is viewed by society as the utmost expression of a couple's commitment and love. Plaintiffs may now seek this ultimate expression through a civil marriage.\" The ruling (which is stayed for 30 days in case the city chooses to appeal) says the New York City clerk may no longer deny marriage licenses to same-sex couples. If the city chooses to appeal the case, it has about a month to file a notice in state appeals court. Justice Ling-Cohan's ruling also said, \"Similar to opposite-sex couples, same-sex couples are entitled to the same fundamental right to follow their hearts and publicly commit to a lifetime partnership with the person of their choosing. The recognition that this fundamental right applies equally to same-sex couples cannot legitimately be said to harm anyone.\" \n \n \"This ruling is historic, well reasoned and, above all, fair,\" Sommer said. \"Our clients got full and fair consideration in this case, which is all we asked for. The court obviously looked carefully at the state Constitution and the rights and protections that same-sex couples were being denied because they couldn't marry. This decision is grounded solidly in the law and the state's Constitution.\"\n \n Justice Ling-Cohan has been a New York Supreme Court Justice since 2002. Before that, she was a judge in Civil Court for the City of New York for seven years. Voters in Manhattan (in districts including Chinatown and Lower Manhattan) elected her to both positions. When Ling-Cohan ran for the New York Supreme Court, she was the only candidate in a field of 12 who was nominated by four parties, including the Republican and Democratic parties. She received 50,384 votes on the Republican Party line; her support from the Republican Party line was higher than the majority of the other candidates. \n \n The 2000 U.S. Census counted 594,391 households in the country where same-sex couples live together. Of those, 46,490 (or 7.8 percent of the national total) are in New York State, and 25,906 (or 4.3 percent of the national total) are in New York City. City and state law provides some limited protections and rights to same-sex couples. \n \n Lambda Legal filed the lawsuit in March 2004 seeking marriage licenses for same-sex couples in New York, arguing that denying marriage to same-sex couples violates the state Constitution's guarantees of equality, liberty and privacy for all New Yorkers. The case was the first of its kind to be filed in New York since the Massachusetts high court ruled that same-sex couples are entitled to full marriage under that state's Constitution.\n \n Lambda Legal is currently litigating cases seeking marriage for same-sex couples in New Jersey, California (with NCLR and ACLU) and Washington State (with NWLC). The Washington State Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in that lawsuit on March 8, and a decision is pending from the trial court in the California case. A New Jersey state appeals court heard arguments in that case in December, and a decision is pending. \n \n Sommer is Lambda Legal's lead attorney on the case, Hernandez v. Robles. Jeffrey S. Trachtman and Norman C. Simon of the New York City law firm, Kramer Levin, are co-counsel on the case.\n \n http://www.lambdalegal.org/cgi-bin/iowa/documents/record?record=1634",

None of them applied to the States. \n \n This only changed according to the 14th amendment, but even then it was ignored by the courts and said it \"didn't apply to the states.\" THey basically ignored what was written.\n \n As the process goes, no one has any rights untill each and every right in the Bill as well as one's not mentioned are brought before courts to make a precedent. This process has been going on from 1897-1972, but has stopped since, and there are 2 more enumerated rights in the Constitution which have not yet gone through the court process which applies Rights Protections to the States, giving people civil liberties.\n \n \n \n\n Just because one NY judge says you have the right, doesn't make it so.\n\n \n Right. It matters if the Supreme Court says you have that right, and they most likely will, if they have any scruples.\n \n \n \n Don't you love how congress can just redefine marriage without using any reason, logic or justification? It's funny how downhill AMerica has fallen.\n \n \n If what the minority is claiming to be a right isn't really a right to begin with (and so their really seeking a special right), then yes.\n\n \n So, wanting not to be denied marriage based your sexual orientation is not wrong, is what you are saying =D Bigotry at its best. All citizens are protected under the law for equal treatment. Forcing someone to marry someone else, whom that person has no attraction, or getting nothing, is not equal, just as separate but equal is not equal.\n \n You have the right to marry anyone, as long as that person is the same race as you. :) Yawn, same logic, same tired argument.\n \n \n \n \n I'd settle for judges that have read and understand their function within the Constitutional Framework.\n\n \n Yes. Hopefully they will see silly, unconstituational, immoral laws for what they are.",

   "Imaginary Constitutional rights don't count. Just because one NY judge says you have the right, doesn't make it so. If you recall, the Florida Supreme court thought it had the right to change Florida election law......and they were wrong in doing so. The \"fat lady\" hasn't sung until the NY ruling is upheld by the SCOTUS or until Congress says so.\n \n I'd settle for judges that have read and understand their function within the Constitutional Framework. emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n I must argue that your understanding of the Constitutional framework is flawed. First, the framers of the Constitution did not intend the Constitution to list out every single protected right of the people. Mosts Federalists were opposed to even having a Bill of Rights because they did not want anyone to construe it as the only rights held by the people. In fact, they specifically put in an ammendment that the Constitution cannot be construed as a list of the only rights held and protected by the people. The Federalists who opposed the Bill of Rights claimed that if no Bill of Rights was present, the government would operate only using the specifically listed powers. If a Bill of Rights was appened, well that is a document which specifically lists out things that a government cannot do. It changes the line of reasoning that people use; it changes them from thinking in terms of what the government CAN do to what the government CANNOT do. The Federalists argued that as long as the people understood that they must only allow the government to do what the Constitution says it CAN do, the the government will be less likely to restrict freedom. The Constitution does not give the government the power to deny freedom, equality, or the rights of the people in any fashion. According to the Constitution, the government has absolutely no power to instute a Defense of Marriage Act.\n \n But the legislature is composed of men who want their policies put into law, just as the judicial branch is, and just as the executive branch is. The framers of the Constitution knew this; they knew that the legislative branch would try to get as much power as it could, even if the Constitution did not give them that power. They knew that the same would hold true of the executive branch and the judicial branch. All three of those branches step outside of the power granted to them by the Constitution. This is why our framers implemented these branches in the first place. By implementing a seperation of powers, it becomes much more difficult for one of those branches to step outside it's realm of power because if it does, the other two branches are free to rise up against it. This does not mean that one of the branches cannot step outside of its power, but it can only do so if the other two branches do not stop it. Each branch is limited in a significant fashion; the house is tied to the opinions of the people while the judicial branch is far removed from the will of the majority but is limited in power compared to the ability to amend the Constitution. It was the hope of the founders that this sort of setup would allow the branches to step outside their realms of power only when there is a morally justified reason for doing so. I feel like I've only given an overview, but going into detail would require far too much room; there is plenty of justification for these branches listed in The Federalist Papers.\n \n So the judicial branch has truly only sort of stepped outside of its realm of power in that it denies the authority of a federal bill which the legislature had no Constitutional authority to pass. Certainly the founders could not have predicted every power the Federal Government would need, nor even most of the powers, so such bills passed by the legislature are not always bad things. It is the job of the Supreme Courts to strike down any laws passed by the government which are immoral and unnecessarily destroy freedom and equality, not those which are merely Unconstitutional. \n \n None of this necessarily gives the New York Supreme Court the legal authority to overrule a bill passed by the federal government, however I'm pretty certain that the New York Supreme Court is bound by the Constitution of New York. They have decreed that the Constitution of New York allows same-sex marriage, which indicates then that the Constitution of New York is illegal under the current laws of the federal government because it professes that people must recieve equal treatment under the law. I will also argue that although the Supreme Court of New York does not have the legal power to overrule such a declaration, they do have the moral authority to overrule it and that it is their job to step outside the power granted to them by their government in order to perserve freedom, equality, and happiness. The judicial branch of New York exists to protect the freedoms of the people, not to preserve the bills passed by the federal government. It is the job of the people and the other branches of government to overrule a deviant branch of government if it steps outside of the power granted to it without a moral reason for doing so.",

In India and parts of Asia, if you have to relieve yourself, you cop a squat by the side of the road and do your business. Try that in the US and you'll get arrested and thrown in jail. Why? Because US society has established differing norms of behavior than India and Asia and we accept those norms.\n \n\n This is really a very simple concept and the government ought not prevent or redfine what is irrelevant with which to begin.\n\n Marriage is highly relevant. Just ask Anna Nicole Smith or Donald Trump's new wife how relevant it is. :)\n \n\n Marriage OUGHT to be a union among consentual adults for mutual benefit. That's it, period. None of this other nonsense.\n\n That's not the definition that our society with its Christian background accepts or condones.\n \n\n \n Lets turn this around and use basic logic. Pretend that the imaginary definition was: \n \n Marriage is a union between a woman and a woman or a man and a man.\n \n Following your logic, heterosexuals have exactly the same ability to access this right to marriage as do homosexuals. However, your logic fails, because it's not possible, nor reasonable to force heterosexuals into a homosexual relationship or face the alternative: nothing. OH NO, the Heterosexuals want unequal treatment! BOOOO. Marry the Fags, you all have the same right! Your concession is accepted.\n\n \n OK, I'll take your argument apart in pieces. 1. What would be the purpose of defining marriage as a homosexual only union? It is anti-biological and an intelligent species understands the need to procreate.\n 2. If heterosexual marriage was illegal, heterosexuals would live together, have kids and continue on their merry way. They wouldn't be forced to marry a same sex partner any more than gays are forced to marry opposite partners now. They could simply carry on their heterosexual relationship unencumbered just as gays can do today. Your logic doesn't hold up to scrutiny.\n \n\n The institutions are not equal if it only allows you to marry people to whom you have no biological connection. YOu fail to comprehend the ability to have a RIghT. To have a right, you must have reasonable access and ability to exercize that Right. Marriage, being a Universal Human Right, is not equally accessible through a mechanism to homosexuals, for it's not biologically sound to force a homosexual to choose between heterosexuals or nothing.\n\n First, marriage is not a Universal Human Right. There are many instances in which marriage is prohibited. It isn't an absolute.\n Secondly, marriage is defined as one man, one woman. Your attempt to redefine it as something that it hasn't been in Christian societies, since at least the 13th Century, is to argue a \"right\" based on a fallacy.\n Just as I can't claim that I don't have to pay income taxes because I'm redefining \"Native American\" as someone born in America, you have to meet certain criteria to become part of a married couple. It's OK to not meet the criteria, it just means that you can't enjoy the benefits of that group, just like I can't enjoy the benefits of being a Native American because I don't meet the criteria for that group. \n \n\n It's wrong to only allow Heterosexuals to marry, and not have an easily accessible, sound mechanism for other Humans, especially when you have no business telling them what they can and cannot do in their private, consentual life.\n\n \n Marriage was initially established to protect children and provide for their welfare as well as establish certain rights for the mother with respect to her husband's assets, progeny, etc., \n None of these benefits were intended for same-sex couples because same-sex couples were considered a perversion of nature at the time that our laws were established.\n So, once again I say, if you want same sex marriage, you have to change sociatal norms and make it acceptable to the masses. That's the way social mores change in a modern society.",

Simply because it changes one way, does not mean it will change in a totally different way.\n\n \n Cultural, or legal?\n \n Again, we need to remember that cultural marriage (a ceremony, commitment between a man and woman in love) is the marriage, and the only role the govt. plays is giving of benefits for it. The govt. role isn't the marriage, it's the recognition of the marriage.\n \n It's true that different cultures and periods of time viewed marriage differently. Centuries ago marriage was an aquisition of a wife by a man--women were treated as a glorified form of property. But it could be argued that even then, the one thread through the centuries of marriage is the man/woman dynamic. This should not surprise us, because early on procreation would have set that standard. One could also argue that historical cases of gay relationships were not really marriages, as marriage has pretty much been considered to refer to man/woman relationships.\n \n With that said, we also need to note that benefits as given by the govt. in the U.S. did not take place early on at all. So really, marriage benefits given by the govt. is a fairly recent pehnomenon.

   "Really? So the definition of a marriage wasn't a contract laid out by power hungry rulers attempting to subjegate land and people? WOW, so where exactly did \"arranged marriages\" come from then? \n \n It had little to do with who the participants were rather than their motives for doing such. \n \n Or maybe we should go back a bit further to biblical times: There appears to be strong same sex relationships in the Bible; one between Ruth and Naomi (Ruth says to Naomi, 'May nothing but death separate us'). These are words used in wedding ceremonies, and the other relationship is between David and Jonathan. The Bible states that David's love for Jonathan was greater than his love for women. Ruth is said to have cleaved to Naomi. This word is also used in Genesis regarding how a husband should relate to his wife.\n \n Not to mention that later on David wound up having SEVEN WIVES!!!! \n \n Where's the \"one man and one woman\" idea there? Hmmm...\n \n Don't even try that line with me because you and I know perfectly well that is just isn't true.\n\n \n Interesting.

Ever read Genesis? Are you familiar with Sodom and Gomorrah and their fate? emoticon_wow\n\n \n \n I'm not straddling any fence. There are two arguments here of which I am well versed in both. Both arguments are of the same general subject, both arguments are fairly weak in their opposition to allowing same sex marriages. One thread is dealing with the legality and this one has strayed into the rhelm of the biblical. \n \n Oh darling, I am well versed in the whole Soddam and Gomorrah sham too. Here let me explain:\n \n Genesis 19 describes how two angels visited Sodom and were welcomed into Lot's house. The men of the city gathered around the house and demanded that Lot send the visitors to the mob so that they might know the angels. [The Hebrew verb yada (to know) is ambiguous. It appears 943 times in the Hebrew Scriptures (Old Testament). In only about a dozen of these cases does it refers to sexual activity; it is not clear whether the mob wanted to rape the angels or to meet with them, and perhaps attack them physically. From the context, it is obvious that their mood was not friendly]. Lot refused, but offered his two virgin daughters to be heterosexually raped if that would appease the mob. The offer was declined. God decided to destroy the city because of the wickedness of its inhabitants. The angels urged Lot and his family to flee and to not look back. Unfortunately, Lot's wife looked the wrong way, so God killed her because of her curiosity.\n \n God was apparently not critical of Lot for offering his two daughters to be raped. However, God was angry at the other inhabitants of the town. He destroyed Sodom with fire and brimstone (sulfur). He presumably killed all of the men in the mob, their wives and other adults, as well as children, infants, newborns, etc. It is unclear from these few verses whether God demolished the city because the citizens: \n \n 1. were uncharitable and abusive to strangers \n 2. wanted to rape people \n 3. engaged in homosexual acts. \n \n The Church has traditionally accepted the third explanation. In fact, the term sodomy which means anal intercourse is derived from the name of the city, Sodom. But the first explanation is clearly the correct one. As recorded in Matthew 10:14-15 and Luke 10:7-16, Jesus implied that the sin of the people of Sodom was to be inhospitable to strangers. In Ezekeiel 16:48-50, God states clearly that he destroyed Sodom's sins because of their pride, their excess of food while the poor and needy suffered, and worshiped many idols; sexual activity is not even mentioned. Jude disagreed with God; he wrote that Sodom's sins were sexual in nature. Various biblical translations describe the sin as fornication, going after strange flesh, sexual immorality, perverted sensuality, homosexuality, lust of every kind, immoral acts and unnatural lust; you can take your pick.\n We are faced with the inescapable and rather amusing conclusion that the condemned activities in Sodom had nothing to do with sodomy.\n \n The story of Sodom and Gomorrah actually condemns inhospitality and idolatry, not homosexuality. Read the Scriptural cross-references: Deuteronomy 29:23, Isaiah 1:9, Jeremiah 23:14, Lamentations 4:6, Ezekiel 16:49-50, Amos 4:11, Zephaniah 2:9, Matthew 10:15 / Luke 10:12, Luke 17:29, Romans 9:29, Jude v.7, Revelation 11:8 \n \n NOWHERE in the Scriptures does it say that the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah was homosexual sex. Even if the specific point of the story was concerning a sexual matter, rather than hospitality, the issue is rape not homosexuality. Jesus claimed the issue was simply one of showing hospitality to strangers (Luke 10:12). How ironic that those who discriminate against homosexuals seem to be the true practitioners of the sin of Sodom.",

   "I'm not straddling any fence. There are two arguments here of which I am well versed in both. Both arguments are of the same general subject, both arguments are fairly weak in their opposition to allowing same sex marriages. One thread is dealing with the legality and this one has strayed into the rhelm of the biblical. \n \n Oh darling, I am well versed in the whole Soddam and Gomorrah sham too. Here let me explain:\n \n Genesis 19 describes how two angels visited Sodom and were welcomed into Lot's house. The men of the city gathered around the house and demanded that Lot send the visitors to the mob so that they might know the angels. [The Hebrew verb yada (to know) is ambiguous. It appears 943 times in the Hebrew Scriptures (Old Testament). In only about a dozen of these cases does it refers to sexual activity; it is not clear whether the mob wanted to rape the angels or to meet with them, and perhaps attack them physically. From the context, it is obvious that their mood was not friendly]. Lot refused, but offered his two virgin daughters to be heterosexually raped if that would appease the mob. The offer was declined. God decided to destroy the city because of the wickedness of its inhabitants. The angels urged Lot and his family to flee and to not look back. Unfortunately, Lot's wife looked the wrong way, so God killed her because of her curiosity.\n \n God was apparently not critical of Lot for offering his two daughters to be raped. However, God was angry at the other inhabitants of the town. He destroyed Sodom with fire and brimstone (sulfur). He presumably killed all of the men in the mob, their wives and other adults, as well as children, infants, newborns, etc. It is unclear from these few verses whether God demolished the city because the citizens: \n \n 1. were uncharitable and abusive to strangers \n 2. wanted to rape people \n 3. engaged in homosexual acts. \n \n The Church has traditionally accepted the third explanation. In fact, the term sodomy which means anal intercourse is derived from the name of the city, Sodom. But the first explanation is clearly the correct one. As recorded in Matthew 10:14-15 and Luke 10:7-16, Jesus implied that the sin of the people of Sodom was to be inhospitable to strangers. In Ezekeiel 16:48-50, God states clearly that he destroyed Sodom's sins because of their pride, their excess of food while the poor and needy suffered, and worshiped many idols; sexual activity is not even mentioned. \n \n \n \n \n Jude disagreed with God; he wrote that Sodom's sins were sexual in nature. Various biblical translations describe the sin as fornication, going after strange flesh, sexual immorality, perverted sensuality, homosexuality, lust of every kind, immoral acts and unnatural lust; you can take your pick.\n We are faced with the inescapable and rather amusing conclusion that the condemned activities in Sodom had nothing to do with sodomy.\n \n The story of Sodom and Gomorrah actually condemns inhospitality and idolatry, not homosexuality. Read the Scriptural cross-references: Deuteronomy 29:23, Isaiah 1:9, Jeremiah 23:14, Lamentations 4:6, Ezekiel 16:49-50, Amos 4:11, Zephaniah 2:9, Matthew 10:15 / Luke 10:12, Luke 17:29, Romans 9:29, Jude v.7, Revelation 11:8 \n \n NOWHERE in the Scriptures does it say that the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah was homosexual sex. Even if the specific point of the story was concerning a sexual matter, rather than hospitality, the issue is rape not homosexuality. Jesus claimed the issue was simply one of showing hospitality to strangers (Luke 10:12). How ironic that those who discriminate against homosexuals seem to be the true practitioners of the sin of Sodom.\n\n \n Oh really?!\n \n \n\n \"Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy. They were haughty and did detestable things before Me. Therefore I did away with them as you have seen\" (Ezekiel 16:49-50).\n\n \n \n\n And there were also sodomites in the land: and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD cast out before the children of Israel. 1 Kings 14:24\n\n \n \n\n 26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:\n \n 27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.\n Romans 1:26-27 \n\n \n \n\n 17 There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel. Deuteronomy 23:17 \n\n \n I can't believe that you would attempt to make such an insane assertion. Clearly, God was speaking about homosexual sex, but I'm not surprised that you left out the most unambiguous scriptural references. emoticon_rolleyes",

   "Actually I would not limit their sin to homosexual behavior, but would say it was a lot of things. Inhospitality (as someone else pointed out), rape, adultery, etc. I doubt their sin was limited to gay sex. But surely you must be aware that the old King James translation used \"know\" to describe sexual relations in a number of places--but that doesn't mean the word captures the original Hebrew very well. \"Know\" has a much less sexual meaning in English. The Bible also describes a man having sex with a woman as \"he went in unto her;\" I suppose if we drop that \"literalist/homophobe\" sort of translation as you call it, we might as well be talking about a man going into the same room as a woman. Let's be realistic--Lot himself describes what they want to do (\"know\" them) as a wicked thing. It's hard to imagine anyone reading this passage and not recognizing their intentions: they wanted to have sex with the visitors who looked like men.\n \n No, the sin of Soddom wasn't just homosexual relations--that was just one of them.\n\n \n This is where you show your true colors, or lack thereof: \n \n Try reading this; http://bible.crosswalk.com/Dictionaries/BakersEvangelicalDictionary/bed.cgi?number=T414\n \n\n Know, Knowledge\n The Old Testament. The Hebrew root yada [[;d\"y], translated \"know\"/\"knowledge, \" appears almost 950 times in the Hebrew Bible. It has a wider sweep than our English word \"know, \" including perceiving, learning, understanding, willing, performing, and experiencing. To know is not to be intellectually informed about some abstract principle, but to apprehend and experience reality. Knowledge is not the possession of information, but rather its exercise or actualization.\n \n Thus, biblically to know God is not to know about him in an abstract and impersonal manner, but rather to enter into his saving actions (Micah 6:5). To know God is not to struggle philosophically with his eternal essence, but rather to recognize and accept his claims. It is not some mystical contemplation, but dutiful obedience.\n \n In the doing of justice and righteousness, Josiah is said to have known God (Jer 22:15-16). True knowledge of God involves obeying the stipulations of his covenant. It is expressed in living conformity to his will. The opposite of knowledge is not ignorance, but rebellion (Jer 22:11-14).\n \n To know is to realize the loss of children (Isa 47:8), grief (Isa 53:3), guilt (Jer 3:13), expediency (Eccl 8:5), conversion (Jer 16:19-21), and judgment (Eze 25:14).\n \n The word \"know\" reflects a variety of skills and professional abilities such as hunting (Gen 25:27), sailing (1 Kings 9:27), playing the harp (1 Sam 16:16), professional mourning (Amos 5:16), and reading (Isa 29:11). It also is used to indicate the ability to distinguish between good and evil (Gen 3:5; Isa 7:15), the left and right hand (Jonah 4:11), the wise and the foolish (Eccl 2:19), the desirable and the undesirable (2 Sam 19:35), and life and death (2 Sam 12:22).\n \n The word \"know\" is used as a euphemism for sex and intercourse: Adam knew his wife Eve and she became pregnant (Gen 4:1). Women who have \"known\" a man are no longer virgins (Num 31:17,35). In his declining days David had an attractive attendant who served him but did not have sexual relationships with him (1 Kings 1:4). Even sexual perversions such as sodomy (Gen 19:5; Judges 19:22) and rape (Judges 19:25) are designated by the word \"know.\"\n \n The word \"know\" is used also to express acquaintance with a person. Jacob questioned the shepherds of Haran, \"Do you know Laban?\" (Gen 29:5). The pual participle of the Hebrew word indicates a close friend (Job 19:14; Psalm 55:13), a neighbor (Psalm 31:11), a companion (Psalm 88:8,18), and a relative (Ruth 2:1).\n \n Divine-human relationships are also expressed by this term. The Lord knew Moses very well-\"by name\" (Exod 33:11,12,17). Moses sought a reciprocal acquaintance with God (Exod 33:13). The psalmist is amazed at God's intimate knowledge (Psalm 139:6) of his personal life, his daily activities (139:1-2), even his unuttered and unformed thoughts (139:4).\n \n The fact that God knows often indicates divine choice. He knew Jeremiah before his birth, singling him out to be a prophet (Jer 1:5). He chose Abraham to be the father of a great nation (Gen 18:19). The statement of am 3:2, \"You (Israel) only have I chosen of all the families of the earth, \" indicates divine selection. It is the way of the righteous that the Lord knows, endorses, and cherishes (Psalm 1:6).\n \n \"Know\" also is used as a treaty term. To know is to acknowledge. Thus when the new king of Egypt did not know Joseph (Exod 1:8) he did not recognize the agreement that had been developed between Joseph and Pharaoh at the time his family came to Egypt. While the ox and donkey know their owner, Israel does not know (Isa 1:3). More than instinct is intended here. Loyalty to the covenant is clearly in mind since the witnesses of that covenant are invoked (Isa 1:2). Moses demands that those who had stood at Mount Sinai and entered into covenant with the Lord acknowledge that agreement and live by it (Deut 11:1-25).\n \n The New Testament. The Greek words commonly translated know are oida [ei [dw] and ginosko [ginwvskw]. These words have the various nuances of meaning of the English word \"know.\" They have been influenced by the Hebrew word yada [[;d\"y], such influence having been mediated through the Septuagint, but they also reflect an adaptation demanded by a pagan world ignorant of God's existence.\n \n The New Testament emphasizes that knowing God is not simply an intellectual apprehension, but a response of faith and an acceptance of Christ. It is he who has made God known (John 1:18). To know Christ is to know God (John 14:7). Eternal life is to know the true God and Jesus Christ (John 17:3). Paul desires to know Christ in his death and resurrection (Php 3:10). Failure to know Jesus as Lord and Messiah (Acts 2:36) resulted in his rejection and crucifixion (1 Cor 2:8).\n \n To know Christ is to know truth (John 8:32). While this is personal, it is also propositional. Knowledge of the truth (1 Tim 2:4; 2 Tim 2:25; 3:7; Titus 1:1) is both enlightenment and acceptance of the cognitive aspects of faith.\n \n Paul uses the rhetorical question, \"Don't you know?\" several times in 1 Corinthians (3:16; 5:6; 6:2, 3, 9, 15; 9:13, 24). This may be an appeal to common knowledge, or a reference to a corpus of teaching that the apostle had communicated.\n \n Affirmations about God's knowledge are more limited in the New Testament than in the Old Testament. He knows the human heart (Luke 16:15). He knows his children's needs such as clothing and food (Matt 6:32). He even anticipates our petitions (Matt 6:8). In fact, he knows everything (1 John 3:20).\n \n Jesus uniquely knows God (John 8:55 - here knowledge and obedience are equated ). He knows the hidden designs of his questioners (Luke 11:17). He is also perceptive of humankind. Nowhere is his penetrating knowledge noted more than it is in the Fourth Gospel (2:25; 5:42; 6:64; 10:14; 13:1, 11; 18:4; 19:28).\n \n The limits of human knowledge are recognized in the New Testament. It is not through wisdom that the world knows God, but rather through the divine initiative (Gal 4:8-9). It is through the kerygma that humans can know God (1 Cor 1:20-25). Spiritual discernment is not the result of profane reasoning (1 Tim 6:20). God's revelation in Christ has made knowledge of him possible. But at best, this knowledge is partial. Perfection in the area of knowledge is reserved for the age to come (1 Cor 13:12). \n\n \n Guess what? \n \n AS USUAL...YOU ARE WRONG!\n \n The word \"know\" does NOT only mean to have had sexual intercourse. The problem is in how the word, \"yada\" is translated and interpreted. \n I seriously doubt those who \"know\" God have had sexual relations with God. Nor when someone asks if another \"knows\" a mutual aquaintence that there is any inference of one having had sexual relations with the other. \n \n How is it we \"know\" the interpretation of the usage of the word in reference to the men of the city of Sodom wanted to \"know\" the angles by way of having sex with them? \n Aren't Catholics taught that angels have no sexual organs? So, to \"know\" the angles would be impossible, if the visitors were actually angels..right? \n So, wouldn't it be more likely that the men of the city of Sodom wanted to \"know\" the angles by way of seeing that the angles had no sexual organs and thereby \"knowing\" for sure that they were what Lot claimed? \n But of course no one bothers to question the typical translation and interpretation of the meaning and usage of the word in regards to this story. \n This bothers me to know end. \n \n Not to mention that the stories of Sodom were written centuries after the fact, and that story retention at the time consisted of oral histories, isn't it more likely that the story was influenced by political views of the tellers within the historical epochs of which they were told and retold? \n \n I just don't buy into the claptrap, centuries old, of two unearthly beings comming down from the sky and walking into some old dude's house just to put their hosts family in such danger of a completely gay city! \n \n It's just not believable in my book.",

Victims are chosen because they are easy targets, available, or possibly representing something to the perpetrator that they want to hurt. This misconception that rape has something to do with sexual attraction completely ticks me off. It re-victimizes victims - \"she shouldn't have been out so late\" or \"she was wearing a low-cut shirt\" - implying the victim was 'asking for it' and that they perpetrator just couldn't help himself. It is also the reason that some XXXXXX think gay men are more likely to prey on children. A man rapes a boy and so he must be gay. WRONG! The boy was an easy target.

So, to \"know\" the angles would be impossible, if the visitors were actually angels..right? \n So, wouldn't it be more likely that the men of the city of Sodom wanted to \"know\" the angles by way of seeing that the angles had no sexual organs and thereby \"knowing\" for sure that they were what Lot claimed? \n But of course no one bothers to question the typical translation and interpretation of the meaning and usage of the word in regards to this story. \n This bothers me to know end. \n \n Not to mention that the stories of Sodom were written centuries after the fact, and that story retention at the time consisted of oral histories, isn't it more likely that the story was influenced by political views of the tellers within the historical epochs of which they were told and retold? \n \n I just don't buy into the claptrap, centuries old, of two unearthly beings comming down from the sky and walking into some old dude's house just to put their hosts family in such danger of a completely gay city! \n \n It's just not believable in my book.\n\n \n \n OH no, she's at it again.

   "Thank you Jitobear. \n It's true, I do not claim to be Christian. I personally have found there to be too many contradictions in the Christian Bible for me to comfortably follow such a religion without constantly questioning it's integrety. I would, however, more appropriately call myself contendedly agnostic. If I am shown indisputable evidence I am more that willing to admit I may have been wrong. I have a very hard time simply believing in the unseen. \n I am not saying, nor have I ever inferred as such, that I'm not willing to lend my belief where warrented. I want to believe that there is a \"greater good\", but until I know for sure, I will not go along without questioning. \n I personally believe that if there is a God, He created me with a brain in order to question my surroundings, learn and eventually be able to teach others. Again, if there is a God, I would hope that like any \"parent\" he would want me to use what intellegence I have been given, not to waste it on following the guy in front of me because it was the easier thing to do, but rather to follow my heart, question my surroundings and find out for myself how things work and if possible how to improve things for myself and others. \n \n I view the whole Gay Marriage issue as one of those instances where my voice, my personal interest and my efforts can make a change for the better not only for myself but for others in a similar situation..i.e. other gays and lesbians. \n I feel that in doing so also sets an example for my child, to fight against tyrrany and descrimination. To set an example that these things should never be tollerated for any group or individual, let alone ones' own self. One must respect themself before being able to show others how to do the same. \n This to me is a more \"christian\" thing to do. (Please note the lower case \"c\" in \"christian\" as to denote the ideal not the religion.)\n\n \n \n The use of a small \"c\" in Christian is offensive. You use a capital \"G\" for gay marriage, but a small \"c\" on Christian. And why would we expect anything different from you? You, madam, are a hypocrite. You attempted to use the Bible to make a point, which was proven to be inaccurate, then you attacked the Bible as being full of contradictions and lacking proof. Then you follow that with a claim to be an agnostic. Tell me, why did you cite the Bible in the first place if it is a book that means nothing to you? Did you do a little research on a gay website that had snipets of misapplied scripture and think that you could pass them by casual readers of the Bible. \n I'm by no means a devout Christian, but I know enough of the Bible to be able to raise the \"BS Flag\" when I hear ludicrous arguments from people trying to manipulate the Bible for their own purposes. That goes for those on the Right who think that the Bible is their own little cash cow. I resent those efforts as well.\n My religion, Catholicism, with all its present day warts, teaches about tolerance towards those who are different, but it isn't ambiguous on marriage or the Church's position on gay marriage. It is very consistent and the scriptures read in church and during marriage ceremonies are very unambiguous. Now, you are free to follow them, blow them off, whatever, but just be prepared to defend yourself when you choose to misapply them.",

Homo's, Jerry Falwell and James Dobson will never change their views because, they make millions of dollars to brainwash folks to hate our families and kids. Money rules for those guys. The word, \"homosexual\" should not be in the bible. It is a mistranslation error. Those laws were meant for Jewish religious purposes only. In the 21st. Century, gays are finally speaking out and we are facing opposition from the majority. It's similiar to blacks speaking out or any other former oppressed group. The bible was used against blacks, Jews, women, and countless others. If gay folks were not born homosexual, why do they commit suicide because of their sexual orientation? Some folks use the word \"morals.\" But that word have many different meanings for various folks.",

   "Off course an anti gay person will use the bible as a weapon against homosexuals. Every oppressd group have had the bible thrown at them.\n\n \n Homosexuals are not an oppressed group in the same sense of black people and native americans. This is obvious for two reasons:\n \n 1.) They have not experienced anything remotely similar to the suffering of these groups; homosexuals have never been enslaved or forced onto reservations in the U.S. for being gay. They've never been sold on auction blacks for being gay. Homosexuals have never had to drink from their own segregated water fountains or use their own restrooms. The overall economic standard of gay people is basically on par with white anglo-saxon typical Americans--so they haven't suffered economic loss. Mostly what they call \"suffering\" is having to have people look at them funny when they show public affection with another gay person. Hardly suffering. Occassionally there are isolated tragic cases where gay people are harmed and a few have been killed, such as in the case of Matthew Shepard. but such cases of hate killings toward homosexuals are rare. \n \n 2.) Homosexuals are not a group in the sense that there is a cultural ethnicity. Black people, Jews, native Americans, etc. are all ethnic groups. Yet gay pride organizations and activists are trying to portray this small percentage of people who happen to engage in the perversion of sex with people of their own gender the same as an ethnic group. They've basically refused to stop at all costs to portray themselves this way, even though their entire \"common denominator\" is nothing more than their behavior (sex with their own gender), even at the cost of lowering decency standards in our country, porn becoming more prevalent, cheapening the institution of marriage by trying to say their bizarre sexual antics (same-sex) should be called a \"marriage,\" and other things. They are basically trying to piggy-back off of the civil rights movement, using the plight of black people and others to their political advantage. They've put a lot of effort into trying to take all the focus off the obvious fact that it's about what they DO, and tried to make people think it's about a state of being. This is irrelevant, because the behavior is still there and most people view it as, well, disgusting.\n \n Now, let's also note some other things . . .\n \n Have gay people been \"oppressed?\" Yes, in some ways. There are times they are denied jobs because people finding out about their behavior, or denied housing. There are other examples of discrimination that shouldn't be there even though they do engage in behavior that society considers taboo. But let's not buy into the idea that it's on par with the slaves of the 19th century, or the native americans herded up onto reservations. We need to at least be realistic and not overstate things--to put gay people on par with blacks regarding oppression is pretty much an insult to the slaves of the 19th century. So when a group like people who engage in homosex with others has the Bible \"thrown at them,\" it's because of their behavior. But when blacks had the Bible \"thrown at them,\" it was wrongly applied because they were an ethnic group (something that can't be said about people who engage in gay behavior).",

No interpretation on my part is needed. It's there in black and white. No question, no ambiguity.\n\n \n http://hcqsa.virtualave.net/bible.html\n Against the Laws of Nature - Romans 1:26 \n \n \n Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural (physin) relations for unnatural (para physin) ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural (physin) relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another.\n Romans 1:26 \n In the preceding passage the Greek words physin and paraphysin have been translated to mean natural and unnatural respectively. Contrary to popular belief, the word paraphysin does not mean \"to go against the laws of nature\", but rather implies action which is uncharacteristic for that person. An example of the word paraphysin is used in Romans 11:24, where God acts in an uncharacteristic (paraphysin) way to accept the Gentiles. When the scripture is understood correctly, it seems to imply that it would be unnatural for heterosexuals to live as homosexuals, and for homosexuals to live as heterosexuals.\n \n Now my own thoughts:\n I also have a problem with this notion that God could give people over to lusts. How does God give people over to these feelings, that are against their personal nature, if they always had their own free will? Someone who has his or her own free will cannot be given over to lusts by anyone else. This implies that at some point there is a lack of free will here. Are we God's sexual playthings?",

No interpretation on my part is needed. It's there in black and white. No question, no ambiguity.\n\n \n \n Actually, there's nothing but questions. \n Romans 1:26 and 27, at first glance, appears to condemn gay and lesbian activity. Paul criticizes sexual activity which is against a person's nature or disposition. But in Greek society of the time, homosexuality and bisexuality was regarded as a natural activity for some people. Thus Paul might have been criticizing heterosexuals who were engaged in homosexual activities against their nature. He might not be referring to homosexuals or bisexuals at all.\n \n The verses preceding 26 might indicate that he was referring to sexual acts associated with idol worship. The verse is too vague to be interpreted as a blanket prohibition of all same-sex activities.\n \n ROMANS 1:24-27 \n \n This passage has been used by some Christians to make an issue over how \"unrighteous\" and sinful homosexuals are. In fact, it has been used to support the view that AIDS is the \"penalty of their error which was due.\" What is fascinating about this kind of application is that it is totally at odds with what, I believe, Paul was really saying. IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE POINT OF ROMANS CHAPTER ONE YOU MUST READ ROMANS CHAPTERS ONE THROUGH THREE. The outline is as follows: \n \n I. The Gospel is for EVERYONE, Jews and Gentiles. (1:16) \n \n II. Why? Because God's wrath is against ALL unrighteousness. (verse 18). \n \n II. The Gentiles need the Gospel. (1:28-32) The examples of their \"uncleanness\" include idolatry and homosexual acts which are either connected to or resulting from idolatry. \n \n III. But the Jews are just as unrighteous as the Gentiles. (2:3) \n \n IV. \"All have sinned\" and are \"justified (made right with God) FREELY by God's grace (unearned love) through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ.\" (3:23-24) \n \n While Paul is certainly not favorable toward the homosexual acts that he is writing about it is interesting to note that Paul classifies them \"unclean\" which is not necessarily a \"moral\" precept. (According to the Holiness Code lobsters and shrimp are \"unclean\" also.) He may be pointing out that though the Jews are different than the Gentiles in that they are ritually \"clean\" (according to the Old Covenant) they are still just as much in need of the grace of the New Covenant. \n \n Let's look at some of the verses in this section: \n \n Verse 27b \"And receiving in themselves the penalty of their error which was due\". Is Paul here saying that those who committed homosexual acts were punished in some physical way...as in venereal disease? Or could \"uncleanness,\" being cut off from the Old Hebrew Covenant, be the penalty of the Gentile's error? \n \n 28 \"And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to adebased mind, to do those things which are not fitting...\" People often take this to mean one of the following things: \n \n - Since homosexuals didn't retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a debased mind. \n - Since the Gentiles were idolatrous God gave them over to a debased mind of homosexuality. However, I believe that Paul was saying the following: \n \"Since the Gentiles did not retain God in their knowledge God gave them over to a debased mind. The debased mind is NOT homosexuality but a mind that is centered on unrighteousness, hence the listing of what the Gentile mind is full of in verse 29. \n - 29-32 This list of \"unrighteousness\" is being applied to all Gentiles, not Gentiles that commit homosexual sex acts. It is the Gentiles \"who are worthy of death.\" These verses are really just an exposition of verse 18. \n - 26-27 Another interesting point to consider is that people often use verse \n - 26-27 to prove that Paul used an argument from \"nature\" to prove that homosexual activity was wrong. However that kind of usage of the word \"nature\" is highly unlikely as Paul usually uses the word \"nature\" or \"natural\" to mean not what \"Mother Nature\" does but instead he means \"the previously accepted common usage\". Nature is not a great teacher about ethics and humans are nowhere called in scripture to emulate it. What is more, homosexual activity DOES go on in the animal world. \n \n It must be remembered also that Paul was referring to homosexual ACTS, not homosexuals. AND NO ONE KNOWS WHAT HOMOSEXUAL ACTS PAUL WAS TALKING ABOUT... NO ONE KNOWS THE BACKGROUND... We must ask ourselves \"what type of homosexual acts was Paul talking about?\" Was he talking exclusively about homosexual acts connected with idolatry? (Perhaps that was the only kind of homosexual activity he was familiar with.) Was he talking about pederasty? Was he talking about homosexual acts committed with slaves? Was he talking about people of heterosexual orientation committing homosexual acts? Just exactly what type of homosexual acts was he concerned with? Do people have the Right to just ASSUME that these verses were a blanket condemnation of homosexual sex in every context? \n In my personal opinion Paul was referring to same sex sexual acts committed in idolatrous worship by people he regarded as heterosexual. Even the most conservative theologian can only give their opinion as to what type of same sex acts Paul was referring to. No one can state that God clearly condemns all homosexuality activity based upon these verses. It is just too vague. \n \n As for me, based on the context of Paul's writing in Romans chapters 1-3 I choose to believe that God's New Covenant of grace embraces those who believe in Jesus; being a Jew doesn't make you better than a Gentile; being a heterosexual doesn't make you any better than a homosexual. Romans chapters one through three strike at the very heart of self-righteous pride. It is amazing that some Christians continue to lord their own sense of righteousness over gays and lesbians as if their heterosexual sex acts make them somehow better, or less in need of grace. We are all in need of grace and we ALL have that grace in Jesus Christ.",

   "Homosexuals are not an oppressed group in the same sense of black people and native americans. This is obvious for two reasons:\n \n 1.) They have not experienced anything remotely similar to the suffering of these groups; homosexuals have never been enslaved or forced onto reservations in the U.S. for being gay. They've never been sold on auction blacks for being gay. Homosexuals have never had to drink from their own segregated water fountains or use their own restrooms. The overall economic standard of gay people is basically on par with white anglo-saxon typical Americans--so they haven't suffered economic loss. Mostly what they call \"suffering\" is having to have people look at them funny when they show public affection with another gay person. Hardly suffering. Occassionally there are isolated tragic cases where gay people are harmed and a few have been killed, such as in the case of Matthew Shepard. but such cases of hate killings toward homosexuals are rare. \n \n 2.) Homosexuals are not a group in the sense that there is a cultural ethnicity. Black people, Jews, native Americans, etc. are all ethnic groups. Yet gay pride organizations and activists are trying to portray this small percentage of people who happen to engage in the perversion of sex with people of their own gender the same as an ethnic group. They've basically refused to stop at all costs to portray themselves this way, even though their entire \"common denominator\" is nothing more than their behavior (sex with their own gender), even at the cost of lowering decency standards in our country, porn becoming more prevalent, cheapening the institution of marriage by trying to say their bizarre sexual antics (same-sex) should be called a \"marriage,\" and other things. They are basically trying to piggy-back off of the civil rights movement, using the plight of black people and others to their political advantage. They've put a lot of effort into trying to take all the focus off the obvious fact that it's about what they DO, and tried to make people think it's about a state of being. This is irrelevant, because the behavior is still there and most people view it as, well, disgusting.\n \n Now, let's also note some other things . . .\n \n Have gay people been \"oppressed?\" Yes, in some ways. There are times they are denied jobs because people finding out about their behavior, or denied housing. There are other examples of discrimination that shouldn't be there even though they do engage in behavior that society considers taboo. But let's not buy into the idea that it's on par with the slaves of the 19th century, or the native americans herded up onto reservations. We need to at least be realistic and not overstate things--to put gay people on par with blacks regarding oppression is pretty much an insult to the slaves of the 19th century. So when a group like people who engage in homosex with others has the Bible \"thrown at them,\" it's because of their behavior. But when blacks had the Bible \"thrown at them,\" it was wrongly applied because they were an ethnic group (something that can't be said about people who engage in gay behavior).\n\n \n You really are very silly. Being gay is not about behaviour. If it were I would only be gay when I am having sex. I am gay even when I don't have sex. So it's only a problem for you, coming from your religious perspective, if gay people engage in gay sexual behaviour. They can be gay, as long as they don't engage in sex. Thus, you recognize there is an identity, and not only behaviour.\n \n It is disgusting to you, and a perversion? Well, I think your behaviour is disgusting and perverted. Do I get to take away your rights now?\n \n How is losing your job because of who you are, not oppression? In many states people can still be fired because they identify as a gay person. It doesn't necessarily have to do with their sex lives. A large percentage of youth on the street are gay or lesbian. They told their parents they are gay or lesbian, and were thrown out into the street. This didn't necessarily have to do with their behaviour. Thus unlike other minorities, many gays and lesbians can't even turn to their parents and families for support. Where do you have your head buried, jyoshu? I find this post of yours, astonishing.",

If you are legally allowed to marry whom you wish and I'm not...guess what....it's about civil rights! \n \n \n \nIn the early 70's when the API removed homosexuality from it's list of pathologies it was under heavy pressure from gay lobbiests. The majority of psychiatrists beleived it was a wrong move.\n\n \n Ah, but have they attempted to replace it back on their books? \n Nope.\n Guess that kinda blows that one.\n \n \n \nThere will always be a very small percentage of the population who are homosexual. That is a given. It is also a given that it is an aberrant behavior.\n\n \n Aberrant and devient are not interchangable words. Homosexuality is not aberrant because there would first have to be a consus of agreement that heterosexuality was the \"Proper\" course of sexual behavior and identity. \n Since there is a vast disagreement as to what is \"proper\" and in what set of circumstances, \"aberrant\" is not aptly used here. \n \n Also your assumption that homosexuality \"will always\" be a small percentage of the population is speculative. Since we already know that percentages of certain individuals posessing peticular traits is already a variable to say it \"will always\" be a small percentage cannot accurately be utilized. \n \n \nJust because certain animals and prison inmates sodomize one another does not make it normal or generaly acceptable for most of the population.\n\n \n No one suggested it did. Also, your attempt to seperate humans from the animal kingdom on the whole is simply ignorant of fact. Humans are animals.\n Then you attempted to suggest that other animals relationships are somehow different than humans...you don't know that...not to mention your assumption is highly speculative. Then you go on again to suggest that prison inmates are somehow representative of committed, loving relationships or that they correspond in anyway to those of us who are not incarcerated. \n \n \n \nI don't wish to deny anyone their liberty to be a \"turd burglar\" just don't try and introduce it in schools and say it's normal.\n\n \n Now we're supposed to take you seriously? A grown man who utilizes a cartoon character (and a highly controversial one at that) as his avitar and who uses the term \"turd burglar\": Expects anyone to actually assume this person is mature? \n \n \n It is not.\n\n \n What you forgot was that it's not normal FOR YOU. It is, however, normal for homosexuals. \n \n \nIf the people had thier say and not just liberal judges and educators this would never be an issue. This really is a situation were a very small minority has a disporportional voice over the general population.\n\n \n Thankfully this actually is our legacy. This country has relied on \"liberal\" judges to ensure what the \"people\" would distroy or deny simply out of fear, hate and ignorance. This has happened several times thoughout our history. Womens right to vote, womens right to choose, the right of other races to freely attend public schools together, the right of other races to marry those of another race if they so choose, the right of other races to vote without being subjected to a \"literacy\" test. \n \n Over and over \"liberal judges\" have been forced to tell the American public that denial of equal liberty, protection and pursuit of happiness for any citizen is wholly wrong! \n \n \n \nAlfred Kinsey was a pedophile and a sadomasochist. It is his philosophy which guides and is the foundation of the gay movement. \n Cute heh! and they are rewriting the books for our kids.\n Something wrong with this picture? emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n \n There you go again. Attempting to suggest one thing is in anyway related to another thing. Such as pedophilia and sadomasochism. The two only have one detail in common, sex. That is where any similarities of the two behaviors stops. \n I am not in anyway defending anyone who victimizes another human being, whether it be by exploiting someone's lack of mental or emotional maturity or brutalizing someone else. But to suggest that the two behaviors are in anyway related is simply grotesque.",

But to extend your particular concept into secular law, you do not, in the USA, have that right.\n \n \nThe term 'marriage' itself belongs to the church,\n\n \n You speak of \"the church\" Which church is \"the\" church?\n \n \n \nthey should be allowed to deny anyone access they want. In its roots, the different religions are 'clubs', and should be allowed to decide what they want to do.\n\n \n I can agree with that, as long as those \"clubs\" do not attempt to impose their particular clubs bylaws on society in general.\n \n \nGay Marriage hurts society as a whole.\n\n \n Unproven speculation. You have presented not one shred of evidence to support such a preposterous assumption.\n \n \nWithout the sole capability of reproducing, it hampers the growth of society, and further leads to the miseducation that this inert ability to reproduce should be acceptable.\n\n \n Where is your evidence of such?\n \n \n(\"In Defense of Marriage\", has studies detailing how the basic function of reproducing in society is one of the major causes for social, cultural, and mental development in society).\n\n \n Please provide the source of these supposed studies.\n \n \nWe MUST preserve tradition. \n\n \n OK. Let's go back to believing the \"traditional\" beliefs that earth is flat and the sun revolves around the earth while we are at it.\n \n \n \nNot take advantage of it, because its weakening.\n\n \n Again, idle speculation.\n \n \nIf people slowly stopped celebrating the 4th of July, I'd be damned if a bunch of people suddenly wanted to make it \"Communist Russia Day\" because after all, the 4th of July isn't that popular anyway.\n\n \n \"Red herring\" argument.\n \n \nThe State rewards normal functioning traditional families, because they function normally in society, contribute to the societies growth, and are a benefit to the country as a whole. A homosexual couple, no matter how hard they try, cannot cultivate the normal productive enviroment a heterosexual couple can.\n\n \n So, all those studies that show that same-sex couples are just as good at parenting (through artificial insemination, surrogate motherhood, adoption) as straight couples are all false?\n \n \nAs with many people against Gay Marriage, I personally have nothing against gay couples or what they do behind closed doors. They may think my style of living is wrong, just as I think theirs is, and they are welcome to do what they want, as long as its not degrading our society.\n\n \n I know of no gay person or couple that believes your style of living (ie.: marriage) is wrong...... for you and your mate. It is just not right for us. It is you who cannot accept that concept. We are in no way degrading society by being different than you are.",
