What does that entail? Is it similar to what Christians believe? Is there such a thing as \"eternal hell\" in the Jewish Faith??\n \n Answer:\n One of the basic principles of Judaism is that God rewards those who obey His commands and punishes those who disobey. The primary place for both reward and punishment is the afterlife. It is, of course, nearly impossible for us to have any real idea what the actual nature of this reward and punishment is like. While I suspect that the basic idea is similar to that of Christianity, there are probably some important differences. I am not familiar, in any detail, with Christian theology on this point.\n \n Regarding \"eternal hell\", the Talmud teaches us that sinners are released from Hell (Gehinnom in Hebrew) after 12 months (Eduyos 2:10). There are, however, some exceptions to this rule in cases of extreme wickedness where the punishment is truly eternal (Talmud Rosh HaShana 17a).\n \n http://members.aol.com/lazera/archive/belief.html\n \n From Rabbi Yaakov Feldman (Torah.org)\n \n There are two facets of the afterlife: \"Gan Eden\", and \"Gehenom\". Gan Eden (which translates as \"The Garden of Eden\" since it's the spiritual counterpart of the earthly Garden depicted in Genesis) is where the soul delights in G-d. And Gehenom (which is usually taken to be \"hell\" but is actually different) is where the soul suffers the consequences of its misdeeds.\n \n Understand of course that the consequences the soul suffers in Gehenom are spiritual in nature. After all, the body is buried in the ground, so anything that happens after death is non-physical. The sort of \"pain\" the soul suffers in Gehenom can best be depicted as an existential anguish and mortal discomfit brought on by catching sight of oneself for the first time. \n \n \n http://www.torah.org/learning/ramchal/classes/class47.html\n \n \n http://www.scheinerman.net/judaism/ideas/afterlife.html\n \n \n Heaven and Hell in Judaism\n \n \n \"Yes, there is a Jewish concept of heaven where we will all be together with God. Yes, there is a concept of Hell where those who have done evil things will be punished (for no more than 11 months maximum).\"\n \n http://www10.brinkster.com/butlerd/westjudFAQ.html\n \n Hell not a Christian Invention!\n \n \n \"...the first Rabbinic utterances come to us from the time immediately \n before that of Christ, from the Schools of Shammai and Hillel (Rosh haSh. 16 b last four lines, and 17 a).2 The former arranged all mankind into three classes: the perfectly righteous, who are 'immediately written and sealed to eternal life;' the perfectly wicked, who are 'immediately written and sealed to Gehenna;' and an intermediate class. 'who go down to Gehinnom, and moan, and come up again,' according to Zech. xiii. 9, and which seemed also indicated in certain words in the Song of Hannah (1 Sam. ii. 6). The careful reader will notice that this statement implies belief in Eternal Punishment on the partof the School of Shammai. For (1) The perfectly wicked are spoken of as 'written and sealed unto Gehenna;'\n \n \n http://ic.net/~erasmus/RAZ304.HTM\n \n \n \n Gehinnom (g'hee-NOHM); Gehenna (g'HEHN-uh) \n \n \n A place of spiritual punishment and/or purification for a period of up to 12 months after death.

   "Jewish Rabbis, etc., on the Afterlife and Hell\n\n \n \nHell not a Christian Invention!\n\n \n The idea of a three-tiered universe occurs throughout the Judeo-Christian Bible, from Genesis to Revelation. These physical locations consist of 1) heaven somewhere in the sky, 2) the earth below, and 3) hell, deep within the earth. Heaven (to which Jesus was supposed to have ascended bodily and to which, according to Paul, Christians would be bodily raptured) was presumed to exist beyond the solid dome of 'firmament' from which the sun, moon, and stars were suspended. This dome, being either crystalline or metallic, had windows to allow rain to pass through. Imagine a bowl resting upon a flat surface and you get the idea. Likewise, hell was presumed to exist deep within the earth, as suggested by the following...\n \n Num 16:32-33 And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods. They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the congregation.\n \n Mt 12:40 For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.\n \n Eph 4:9 Now that he ascended, what is it but that he (Jesus) also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?\n \n Rom 10:6-7 But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above) Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)\n \n The Apostles' Creed: \"...Jesus Christ...died, and was buried, He descended into Hell.\n \n From the 'Institute For Creation Research'...\n \n So far as we can tell from Scripture, the present hell, is somewhere in the heart of the earth itself. It is also called 'the pit' (Isa. 14:9, 15: Ezek. 32:18-21) and 'the abyss' (Rev. 9:2). . .The writers certainly themselves believed hell to be real and geographically 'beneath' the earth's surface. . .To say this is not scientific is to assume science knows much more about the earth's interior than is actually the case. The great 'pit' [hell] would only need to be about 100 miles or less in diameter to contain, with much room to spare, all the forty billion or so people who have ever lived, assuming their 'spiritual' bodies are the same size as their physical bodies.

These criteria are:\n \n certainty (held with absolute conviction) \n \n incorrigibility (not changeable by compelling counterargument or proof to the contrary) \n \n impossibility or falsity of content (implausible, bizarre or patently untrue) \n \n These criteria still live on in modern psychiatric diagnosis. In the most recent Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, a delusion is defined as:\n\n \n Lets walk through these 3-\n \n Cerainty (held with absolute conviction)- This one certainly fits the religously devout. For those not quite so devout, I can only answer that their mental illness is not quite so advanced and hopefully they can be cured.\n \n incorrigibility (not changeable by compelling counter argument or proof to the contrary)- Obviously. Your religous ranting have been knocked down time and again. You simply ignore the questions you cannot answer then return to argue the same disproven point later.\n \n impossibility or falsity of content (implausible, bizarre or patently untrue)- This, too has been covered. If indeed the concept of an omnipotent, infinite god is indeed correct, it follows that all other religous teachings regarding the nature of god must be incorrect, including our concept of what an omnipotent, infinite god may be. The finite mind cannot comprehend infinitude. \n \n This is the paradox that lies at the root of all religons. If thier perception of god is correct, their understanding of the nature of god MUST be incorrect simply due to limitations of the human psyche. \n \n Most religous people I knwo are not exceptionally bright, and most exceptionally bright people through history have not been religous.

   "That's all you have to offer? If they're so bad, why not just shoot them down and be done with it?\n\n \n I asked for his BEST ONE, that's why. Well, here's for you and daewoo, then. It looks like he's taking a nap so I'll answer the first one of his so you guys can rest easier:\n \n daewoo: Who was jesuss grandfather? In Mtthew, it says that Jacob beget Joseph, the husband of Mary. In Luke, it says that Joseoh was the son of Heli. In fact, BOTH of these guys give long geneologies of Joseph, and the only name common to them is \"Joseph\" How do you account for this? \n \n Different scholars provide various resolutions to this, since we're 2,000 years removed from the situation. But this one seems to work ok.\n \n The answer to this supposed contradiction is relatively simple: the first seventeen verses in the first chapter of Matthew give the genealogy of Jesus through Joseph, while Luke 3 presents the genealogy of Jesus through Mary. Hence, Jacob is the father of Joseph (Matthew 1:16), while Heli is the father of Mary (Luke 3:23). If this is true, the logical question that both critics and serious Bible students ask is why Mary is not mentioned in Luke's genealogy? The answer is again quite simple: Luke follows the strict Hebrew tradition of mentioning only the names of males. Therefore, in this case, Mary is designated by her husband's name. \n \n Lest you think it is unreasonable to conclude that a son-in-law could be called a son, remember that it is recorded in 1 Samuel 24:16 that King Saul (David's father-in-law-1 Samuel 18:27) called David \"son.\" The term \"son\" actually has a variety of meanings in the Bible. It can signify: (1) son by actual birth; (2) grandson; (3) descendent; (4) son-in-law; or (5) son by creation, as in the case of Adam (Luke 3:38). All indications are that in Luke 3:23, the phrase \"son of Heli\" (literally \"of Heli\") refers to Heli's son-in-law, Joseph. The following evidence clearly supports this rationale.\n \n The two narrations of the virgin birth are from two different perspectives. Matthew 1:18-25 tells the story only from Joseph's perspective, while Luke 1:26-56 is told wholly from Mary's point of view. It makes sense, then, that Matthew focused on Joseph's lineage in his genealogy, whereas Luke paid careful attention to Mary's ancestors.\n \n Because the phrase \"as was supposed\" (Luke 3:23) is used to describe Jesus' relationship with his earthly father, one automatically should see that something is different about this genealogy from the one recorded in Matthew chapter one.

   "I asked for his BEST ONE, that's why. Well, here's for you and daewoo, then. It looks like he's taking a nap so I'll answer the first one of his so you guys can rest easier:\n \n daewoo: Who was jesuss grandfather? In Mtthew, it says that Jacob beget Joseph, the husband of Mary. In Luke, it says that Joseoh was the son of Heli. In fact, BOTH of these guys give long geneologies of Joseph, and the only name common to them is \"Joseph\" How do you account for this? \n \n Different scholars provide various resolutions to this, since we're 2,000 years removed from the situation. But this one seems to work ok.\n \n The answer to this supposed contradiction is relatively simple: the first seventeen verses in the first chapter of Matthew give the genealogy of Jesus through Joseph, while Luke 3 presents the genealogy of Jesus through Mary. Hence, Jacob is the father of Joseph (Matthew 1:16), while Heli is the father of Mary (Luke 3:23). If this is true, the logical question that both critics and serious Bible students ask is why Mary is not mentioned in Luke's genealogy? The answer is again quite simple: Luke follows the strict Hebrew tradition of mentioning only the names of males. Therefore, in this case, Mary is designated by her husband's name. \n \n Lest you think it is unreasonable to conclude that a son-in-law could be called a son, remember that it is recorded in 1 Samuel 24:16 that King Saul (David's father-in-law-1 Samuel 18:27) called David \"son.\" The term \"son\" actually has a variety of meanings in the Bible. It can signify: (1) son by actual birth; (2) grandson; (3) descendent; (4) son-in-law; or (5) son by creation, as in the case of Adam (Luke 3:38). All indications are that in Luke 3:23, the phrase \"son of Heli\" (literally \"of Heli\") refers to Heli's son-in-law, Joseph. The following evidence clearly supports this rationale.\n \n The two narrations of the virgin birth are from two different perspectives. Matthew 1:18-25 tells the story only from Joseph's perspective, while Luke 1:26-56 is told wholly from Mary's point of view. It makes sense, then, that Matthew focused on Joseph's lineage in his genealogy, whereas Luke paid careful attention to Mary's ancestors.\n \n Because the phrase \"as was supposed\" (Luke 3:23) is used to describe Jesus' relationship with his earthly father, one automatically should see that something is different about this genealogy from the one recorded in Matthew chapter one. The phrase \"Jesus...being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph\" (emp. added) is indicating that He was not really one of Joseph's biological sons, even though the public commonly assumed such. \n \n Every name in the Greek text of Luke's genealogy, with the exception of Joseph, is preceded by the definite article \"the\" (e.g. the Heli, the Matthat). Although not obvious in our English translations, this stands out to anyone reading the Greek. As nineteenth-century biblical scholar Frederic Godet stated: \"The omission of the article puts the name (Joseph) outside of the genealogical series\" (1890, 1:198, emp. added). In fact, the parentheses in our versions containing the words \"(as was supposed),\" most likely should be extended to include the name \"Joseph\" (Lenski, 1961, p. 220).

NOR is there ANY suggestion in that passage that the geneaology offered is the geneaology of Mary. If indeed that was the Geneaology of Mary, why would the author specifically claim it was the geneology of Joseph? \n \n In order to believe as you do, we have to DISCOUNT the authors words. You are essentially arguing that this is not a contradiction becuase if you IGNORE WHAT THE AUTHOR SAYS, you can imagine that it is sombody elses bloodline.",

   "Did you bother to read what was posted?, i.e. Lest you think it is unreasonable to conclude that a son-in-law could be called a son, remember that it is recorded in 1 Samuel 24:16 that King Saul (David's father-in-law-1 Samuel 18:27) called David \"son.\" The term \"son\" actually has a variety of meanings in the Bible. It can signify: (1) son by actual birth; (2) grandson; (3) descendent; (4) son-in-law; or (5) son by creation, as in the case of Adam (Luke 3:38). All indications are that in Luke 3:23, the phrase \"son of Heli\" (literally \"of Heli\") refers to Heli's son-in-law, Joseph.  Obviously these people cited were in someone's genealogy, even if they weren't specifically listed.\n\n \n Again, give me ONE example in the bilbe where a son in law is referred to as a SON in a geneaology. It simpy DID NOT HAPPEN. The POINT of a geneaogloy iss to show linege, and if you pollute it with in laws, you ahve destroyed the entire point of the exercise. In order for your assertation to be true, it would mean that the disciples were XXXXXX who did not understand the point of giving a geneaology.\n \n To take this one step further, the womans egg was not discovered until the 1800's. In biblical times, it was believed that the MAN was wholly responsible for the baby. They believed it was pretty much like a plant. The man held the seed and the woman was merely a place to plant it. Teh child got nothing from its mother. THAT is why womens geneology was not studied. It did not matter. Listing Marys geneaology would not make any sense at all given the situation.\n \n Lets step into reality for a minute. In order for Jesus to fulfill prophesy, jhas had to be a descendant of David. He had to be a descendant of David on the MANS side, because the woman was nothign but an incubator. THAT was the point fo providing a geneology at all, to show that this was a fulfillment fo the prophecy. It was not until much later, when the myth of the virgin birth became prevelant, that the rediculous problem of geneology actually became a problem. Since jesus pretty much confirms that the old testament prophecies are true, he could not POSSIBLY have been the messiah IF the virgin birth is true, becuase the prophecies regarding the messia SPECIFICALLY require that the messiah be from the (literally translated) \"sperma\" of david. That woud be a direct descendant thgouh the male line.\n \n \n \n \nHebrew tradition lists the males, even when it's a woman's genealogy being referred to. And Luke doesn't say it was the genealogy specifically of Joseph, just that Joseph was (and note this carefully) \"so it was thought\" the son of Heli. \n\n \n No, hebrew tradition does nto list the famales at all for the reasons outlined above. The claim that the passage in question was marys bloodline is absolutly rediculous fo rthose reasons. There would have been no POINT to listing Marys bloodline.\n \n \n \nWrong (see above and my previous response). Nice try, though. I did recommend you study up and come up with something good. This obviously wasn't it.\n\n \n You still haven't answered THIS one. Unless you can cite some realistic fracts supporing your viewpoint, youa re going to have to either keep trying or concede. Nothign you have posted here is even difficult to refute.",

   "Sometimes skeptics can't see the forest for the trees. All four Gospels confirm the resurrection of Jesus Christ, so even when all the Gospel authors say he was resurrected, they still don't believe it. So why should it matter to them about what happened to Judas? How about just, \"Hey man, something bad happened to that dude after he betrayed Jesus.\"\nWhat?!! You must be kidding. This is your educated argument? This is what proves you are a scholar able to dismiss any of our quibbles?\n \n You spend ages claiming the Bible is inerrant, and that you could disprove any contradiction pointed out. Then when one is pointed out you attempt to disprove it in an answer that patently shows that you had not even read the source material being discussed. Then when this is pointed out your answer is essentially \"but the Bible's a good book, so why does it matter?\". It matters because you claimed that it was inerrant, ie with NO errors.

   "Apparently he (daewoo) didn't even know numerous scholars hold Luke's genealogy to be that of Mary's ancestors.\n\n \n The genealogies of Jesus given to us by Matthew and Luke differ considerably. The two genealogies cannot be reconciled. There is no question as to this. Faced with this uncomfortable fact, some Christian apologists have suggested that, whereas Matthew's genealogy of Jesus runs through his biological father, Luke's genealogy of Jesus runs through his biological mother. This, despite the fact that Luke's genealogy never mentions Mary but does mention Joseph. Rather strange, don't you think? Does such an apologia suggest an exercise in grasping at straws? Indeed, it does. Such apologists might have a case if Luke had stated that his genealogy of Jesus ran through Mary. He did not do this nor did he have any logical reason to trace Jesus' genealogy through Mary. To the rest of us, it's simply another confirmation that the Bible is the product of fallible human beings. \n \n \nMy reputation doesn't rest on the whims of some of these infidels who have no other mission in life but to try to bash Christ, the Bible, and anyone who defends them. They're (daewoo, Trebor, Orion, etc.) not here to learn, rather just bash Biblical Christianity.\n\n \n \"Infidels\"? Do you once again find yourself back in the sixteenth century, EZ? The \"good old days\"? Why not \"heretic\", or \"apostate\"? Speaking for myself, I'm not here to 'bash' either Jesus or the Bible. Don't confuse 'bashing' with scholarship or informed opinion. Do you disagree with some of my opinions? No problem - that's what a discussion forum is all about. You understand the difference between discussion and evangelism, don't you? \n \n \nTake Orion, for instance. I've been watching him for over 6 years now and his postings center predominately on an endless array of anti-Biblical arguments and allegations (claiming Jesus was gay, for instance).\n \n \n EZ, I never claimed that Jesus was gay. Let's keep the discussion honest, shall we? I (and others) simply raised the possibility, at other fora, in order to make a point. The fact that even the possibility of a gay Jesus infuriates you (as evidenced by the frequency with which you raise the subject), speaks volumes concerning your own apparent prejudices. \n \n \nHe can't (and won't) discuss his own religious beliefs in any detail, but that doesn't stop him for being a continuous mouthpiece for anti-Biblical fulminations. If you don't believe me go look at his last 100 postings.\n\n \n We refer to this as an attempt at diversion. EZ, I've already explained to you why I choose not to give in to your incessant demands that I explain my personal theology. I must have done this a dozen times in the past, across three or four fora. Unlike you, I'm not an evangelist pushing a particular theology.

Besides, the lineage described in Matthew is from a line that was 'cursed', and removed from being able to be make the messiah.\n \n Such is the ignorance of the Christian.[/QUOTE]\n \n The ignorance is your fallacious argument:\n \n The anti-missionary (Trebor) argument, therefore, is that since Jeconiah is listed in the genealogy of Yeshua, and the curse of Jeconiah excludes ANY of his descendants from ruling on the throne of David, then Yeshua cannot be the Messiah.\n \n However, the Tanakh seems to indicate that the curse on Jeconiah was reversed, through the person of Zerubbabel. Compare this text in Haggai 2 to Jeremiah 22 above:\n \n In that day, says YHVH Tzva'ot, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, says YHVH, and will make thee as a signet ring: for I have chosen thee, says YHVH Tzva'ot.\n Haggai 2:23\n \n Notice the phraseology:\n \" . . . though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, were the signet ring (khotahm, ~twx) on My right hand, yet I would pluck you off\"\n Jeremiah 22:24\n \n Now, as noted above, he says to Zerubabbel, the grandson of Jeconiah:\n \n \". . . O Zerubbabel, my servant, and will make thee as a signet ring (khotahm, ~twx): for I have chosen thee, says YHVH Tzva'ot.\"\n Haggai 2:23\n \n The phraseology of the \"signet ring\" here implies that the curse was lifted. Moreover, this argument is in full agreement with Jewish tradition, unlike the arguments of the anti-missionaries. The Talmud says,\n \n \"Rabbi Johanan said: Exile atones for everything, for it is written, Thus saith the Lord, write ye this man childless, a man that shall not prosper in his days, for no man of his seed shall prosper sitting upon the throne of David and ruling any more in Judah. (Jer. XXII, 30). Whereas after he [the king] was exiled, it is written, And the sons of Jechoniah, - the same is Assir - Shealtiel his son etc. (1 Chr. III, 17)33. [He was called] Assir, (Imprisoned) because his mother conceived him in prison. Shealtiel, because God did not plant him in the way that others are planted. We know by tradition that a woman cannot conceive in a standing position. [yet she did conceive standing. Another interpretation: Shealtiel, because God obtained [of the Heavenly court] absolution from His oath.4 Zerubbabel [was so called] because he was sown in Babylon. But [his real name was] Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah.\n \n Footnotes\n 33. I Ch. III, 17. Notwithstanding the curse that he should be childless and not prosper, after being exiled he was forgiven.\n 4. Which He had made, to punish Jechoniah with childlessness.\"\n Sanhedrin 37b - 38a, Soncino Talmud Edition\n \n This is the \"death blow\" to the Jeconiah curse argument. Numerous places in Judaic literature note that the curse on Jeconiah was annulled:\n \n \" . . . they made the Calf and deserved to be exterminated, and I would have thought that He would curse and destroy them, yet, no sooner had they repented, than the danger was averted, And the Lord repented of the evil (ib. XXXII, 14).And so in many places. For example, He said about Jekoniah: For no man of his seed shall prosper (Jer. XXII, 30) and it says, I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations... In that day, saith the Lord of hosts, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel, My servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith the Lord, and will make thee as a signet (Hag. II, 22 f.). Thus was annulled that which He had said to his forefather, viz. As I live, saith the Lord, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim King of Judah were the signet upon My right hand, yet I would pluck thee thence (Jer. XXII, 24).\"\n Numbers Rabbah XX:20, Soncino Midrash Rabbah\n \n The Jewish Encyclopedia says, not only was the curse revoked, but that Jeconiah was the ancestor of the Messiah!\n \n \"\"Jehoiachin's sad experiences changed his nature entirely, and as he repented of the sins which he had committed as king he was pardoned by God, who revoked the decree to the effect that none of his descendants should ever become king (Jer. xxii. 30; Pesi., ed. Buber, xxv. 163a, b); he even became the ancestor of the Messiah (Tan., Toledot, 20 [ed. Buber, i. 140])\" \n Jewish Encyclopedia, Entry on Jehoiachin2 2.

[This is a rather curious position, since it is consistent with the traditional Jewish opinion that Jeconiah repented while in exile, and also that exile atones for all sins (e.g. Talmud, Tractate Sanhedrin 37b-38a) In this case, the missionaries are actually admitting that the atonement of sins does not require the shedding of blood!] However, their \"end game\" is similar, since they say that no one ruled after Zerubbabel, and that the Davidic line ended there, so that the only way to bring forth a Messiah was through a miraculous event, such as a virgin birth, which, according to them, was G-d's plan from the outset.\n \n \n \n They evidence offered in support of this paradigm is as follows. First, they cite a passage that tells of the release of Jeconiah from his prison cell in Babylon, and being invited to sit at the head of the table of all the other nations' exiled kings in Babylon (Jer 52:31-34 and also II Kgs 25:27-30). This act supposedly negated the \"will not prosper in his days\" phrase. However, contrary to that claim, the cited passages do not say anything about Jeconiah actually prospering in his days (the Hebrew phrase for will not prosper, lo-yitzlakh, used in the curse, is nowhere countermanded in these passages). In fact, Jeconiah never returned to Judah, never returned to sit on the throne of David, and he died in exile, just as was foretold in the curse (Jer 22:27-28).\n \n",

   "If you needed a final coup de gras on this, the following is it (which includes ancient church quotations, traditions, etc., for Luke's genealogy being that of Mary's forefathers.\n \n http://www.frontline-apologetics.com/Genealogy.htm\n \n Thanks for playing!\n \n Jesus was a con man!\n\n \n Lets take a look at this article.\n \n \n\"With the participle w[on, being], there begins then a transition which we owe to the pen of Luke. How far does it extend, and where does the genealogical register properly begin? This is a nice and important question. We have only a hint for its solution. This is the absence of the article tou', the, before the name of Joseph. This word is found before all the names belonging to the genealogical series. In the genealogy of Matthew, the article ton is put in the same way before each proper name, which clearly proves that it was the ordinary form in vogue in this kind of document.... This want of the article puts the name Joseph outside the genealogical series properly so called, and assigns to it a peculiar position. We must conclude from it-1st. That this name belongs rather to the sentence introduced by Luke; 2d. That the genealogical document which he consulted began with the name of Heli; 3d. And consequently, that this piece was not originally the genealogy of Jesus or Joseph, but of Heli.\"4 \n\n \n first, this is wholly incorrect. The \"tou\" does not denote who is inside or outside fo the geneology. The \"tou\" is an indicator of respect used for honored dead people. Calling Joseph \"the Joseph\" would have told us that he was honored and dead. The \"tou\" in front fo the name is meant to signify that the person was held in high enough esteem that no toher identifier was needed. This convention appears in MOST geneologies both in the bible and from otehr sources which survived from the era. Even Josephus used this convnetion when listing certain bloodlines in his works. \n \n The real problem iwth this rediculous line of thought comes from the book of Luke itself. Luke ALWAYS refers to Joseph when he refers to the bloodline of David. \n \n for example:\n \n \nLuke 1:27\n In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary. \n\n \n \nLuke 2:4 \n And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David\n\n \n So not only do we have a bloodline stated in Luke showing that Joseph was of the \"sperma\" of David, we have OTHER passages in the same book that make the same claim.\n \n Not only that, but in Luke 1:36, Luke says that Mary is a relative of Elizabeth, making her of the same house as Elizabeth. In Luke 1:5, he specifically states that the house of Elizabeth is from the house of Aaron, which was NOT of the house of david. Teh house of Aaron was from the tribe of Levi, NOT the tribe of Judah. The house of David was of the tribe of Judah.\n \n When your source points out that Matthew skips several generations, and claims that this supports his position, it does nto take much looking to see that this is fraud ont eh part of your source, and his claim is simply a rather pathetic attempt to cover up a fraud committed by MATTHEW. In matthew 1:17, Matthew says \"So all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations, and from David to the deportation to Babylon fourteen generations, and from the deportation to Babylon to the Christ fourteen generations.\"\n \n \n Matthew is essentially trying to show that every 14 generations, somethign spectacular happens. The problem with this is that his numbers didn't work out, so he lied. He simply subtracted some names from his alleged genealogy and hoped nobody would notice.\n \n Further evidence of the fallacy of your argument, and that of the idiot you linked to, is included in the Bible itself. The rules for tracing a bloodline are laid out in Numbers 1:18 and Jeremiah 33:17. It is explicitly stated that a persons geneology and tribal membership are transmitted SOLEY through your physical father. \n \n Even Godet has a problem with this:\n \n \n\"This study of the text in detail leads us in this way to admit-1. That the genealogical register of Luke is that of Heli, the grandfather of Jesus; 2. That, this affiliation of Jesus by Heli being expressly opposed to His affiliation by Joseph, the document which he has preserved for us can be nothing else in his view than the genealogy of Jesus through Mary. But why does not Luke name Mary, and why pass immediately from Jesus to His grandfather? Ancient sentiment did not comport with the mention of the mother as the genealogical link. Among the Greeks a man was the son of his father, not of his mother; and among the Jews the adage was: 'Genus matris non vocatur genus' (Baba bathra, 110a). In lieu of this, it is not uncommon to find in the O.T. the grandson called the son of his grandfather.\"9\n\n \n While he is certainly correct that there are places in the bible where we see a grandson referred to as \"son\" (according to some translations....the real translation is \"lesser son\") this raises the same quesiton yet again. Since the son is the son of his mother, not his father, nor his grandfather, why would we list Marys bloodline at all? It would have been entirely irrelevant.\n \n Personally, I think this is absolutly hilarious. In order to clear up a contradiction, you cite an article that is itself contradictory. \n \n This is the problem with Godet. He had the same restraints, and the same ability to take liberties with reality withtou having to worry about consequences, that the early church had. He did not have to be consistent as long as the text he cited were sufficiently obscure to assure that nobody would ever check them. \n \n The FAR more plausable explanation for the wording of the passage in Luke that godet desperatly clings to as the cornerstone of his argument is that jesus is called the supposed son of Joseph because we had the whole immaculate concpetion thing going on earlier. You cannot claim immaculate conception then give the bloodline of the father without raising some eyebrows. \n \n Modern biblical scholars do not have the luxury of absolute ignorance (though when I look at some christians and their aversion to knowledge or intelligent debate, I wonder if the dark ages have actually ended or not). You may consider taking a look at some of the work of Raymond Brown. Brown waqs one of the few biblical scholars who survived the 90's. During the 90's we saw \"biblical scholars\" discredited and shamed by the truckload. This was the result of the Catholic decision to digitize their archives. Suddently hundreds of thousands fo religous papers, books, and theories, many original copies, were available to the entire world. Prior to this, in order to view an obscure text that some idiot cites, you had to fly to Rome and apply for permission, then wait for permission to be granted (which was not always a fast process).\n \n Raymond Brown survived, and for years when somebody had a question about the bible that the Vatican could not answer, they send them to Brown. Brown is quoted rather heavily at http://www.simpletoremember.com/vitals/Christian_Credibility.htm responding to this exact question.",

In Luke 1:5, he specifically states that the house of Elizabeth is from the house of Aaron, which was NOT of the house of david. Teh house of Aaron was from the tribe of Levi, NOT the tribe of Judah. The house of David was of the tribe of Judah.\n\n \n Whether the Mother of Mary was the sister of Elizabeth or the sister of Elizabeth's Father, making Elizabeth either an aunt or a cousin of Mary, there is no problem for Elizabeth to be a descendant of Aaron and Mary from the tribe of Judah, and descendant of David. See the following for elaboration.\n \n http://answering-islam.org/BibleCom/lk1-36.html\n \n \n \nWhen your source points out that Matthew skips several generations, and claims that this supports his position, it does nto take much looking to see that this is fraud ont eh part of your source, and his claim is simply a rather pathetic attempt to cover up a fraud committed by MATTHEW. In matthew 1:17, Matthew says \"So all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations, and from David to the deportation to Babylon fourteen generations, and from the deportation to Babylon to the Christ fourteen generations.\"\n\n \n From the same source: Matthew is not plainly saying that there were fourteen immediate biological generations in each period. In fact, when in his opening verse Matthew speaks of Jesus as \"Son of David, son of Abraham,\" he is setting up a definition of terms which enlarges the notion of a generation. Just as Matthew can use the word 'son' to mean any descendant in the direct line, so can he use the word 'begot' to mean any ancestor in the direct line. Therefore, he does not err in saying in the second set of names that \"Joram begot Oziah\" (Mt 1:8), even though there were three immediate biological generations in between. Matthew is saying that there were fourteen undisqualified generations in each period of time, and his point has force as long as there is a discernible reason for omitting some of the immediate generations in keeping with the purpose of his writing.\n \n From the earliest times commentators have remarked that some immediate generations were omitted by Matthew, and the reason that they ascribe has to do with wickedness. Thus, the wickedness of Her and Onan (Gen 38) led to the elimination by God of one generation in the descent of the seed of Abraham to Joseph. Otherwise, the first set would have had fifteen names.\n \n Regarding the second set of \"fourteen\" generations, we read that \"Joram begot Oziah\" (Mt 1:18). But we know that Joram was actually the great-great-grandfather of Oziah, because Oziah is another name for Azariah (cf. 2 Chr 26:1; 2 Kg [4 Kg] 14:21), and in 1 Chr 3:11-12 we read: \"and Joram begot Ochoziah, from whom sprang Joas, and his son Amasiah begot Azariah.\" Hence, Matthew omits the generations of Ochoziah, Joas, and Amasiah from his list, and the judgments given in the Old Testament upon these people may tell us why.\n \n \n \nYou cannot claim immaculate conception then give the bloodline of the father without raising some eyebrows.\n\n \n Sure you can, when the bloodline is of Mary's father, etc. She can be descended from that bloodline but still have a child conceived by the Holy Spirit, which is what historically occurred. \n \n \nYou may consider taking a look at some of the work of Raymond Brown. Brown waqs one of the few biblical scholars who survived the 90's. During the 90's we saw \"biblical scholars\" discredited and shamed by the truckload.

I'm certain that you're capable of discussion, EZ.\n\n \n Recommend you give up on your liberal rags and expand your horizons with something more scholarly. You can start with the \"Baker Encyclopedia of Christian Apologetics,\" by Norman Geisler, which pretty much decimates your false contentions.",

   "[QUOTE=daewoo]\n\n Maybe you missed my earlier post? The word used there was zera. The same word that ius used multiple other places in the bible. In a human context it means \"offspring\", not seed. \n The word zera is used there, too, for offspring. It is used hundreds of times in the bible, and in only 2 places is it translated as \"seed\" when used in relation to a person or people. \n The passage in genesis is a simple mistranslation.\n\n \n Thanks for the explanation.

   "Whether the Mother of Mary was the sister of Elizabeth or the sister of Elizabeth's Father, making Elizabeth either an aunt or a cousin of Mary, there is no problem for Elizabeth to be a descendant of Aaron and Mary from the tribe of Judah, and descendant of David. See the following for elaboration.\n \n http://answering-islam.org/BibleCom/lk1-36.html\n\n \n \n The problem here is that your link is WHOLLY incorrect. We have already established that the tribe and geneology was tracked whooly through the MALE line. What your article is essentially claiming is that Mary was a relative of Elizabeth through the family of marys mother. A child was NOT a relative of their mothers family by customs of the time since there was no blood relation (since the entire \"person\" came from the father). In order for them to be \"relatives\" they HAD to be of the same bloodline, which means the same tribe and house. Sorry.\n \n \n \nFrom the same source: Matthew is not plainly saying that there were fourteen immediate biological generations in each period. In fact, when in his opening verse Matthew speaks of Jesus as \"Son of David, son of Abraham,\" he is setting up a definition of terms which enlarges the notion of a generation. Just as Matthew can use the word 'son' to mean any descendant in the direct line, so can he use the word 'begot' to mean any ancestor in the direct line. Therefore, he does not err in saying in the second set of names that \"Joram begot Oziah\" (Mt 1:8), even though there were three immediate biological generations in between. Matthew is saying that there were fourteen undisqualified generations in each period of time, and his point has force as long as there is a discernible reason for omitting some of the immediate generations in keeping with the purpose of his writing.\n\n \n BS. Go back and read it again:\n \n 17 Thus there were fourteen generations in all from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to the exile to Babylon, and fourteen from the exile to the Christ.\n \n Matthew CLEARLY states 14 generations. In fact, he states \"14 generations IN ALL from Abraham to David. NONE of the timelines he represents (abraham to david, david to exile, exile to christ) contain 14 generations. NONE OF THEM. Matthew commmits fraud here. He edited the genealogy to \"create\" 14 generations when there were in fact NOT 14 generations. He CLEARLY STATES the 14 generations. There is no wiggle room on this one.\n \n He edited Jesus bloodline to coincide with a sacred number (7) and to make it add up to the numeric value of Davids name. It was clear fraud. He LIED. You are climing that he is not saying plainly that there were 14 generations when PLAINLY he was.\n \n \n \nSure you can, when the bloodline is of Mary's father, etc. She can be descended from that bloodline but still have a child conceived by the Holy Spirit, which is what historically occurred. \n\n \n And yet you still have not answered the fact that tracing jesus by marys bloodline would have been contrary to everythign we know about how such things were done, as well as contrary to the religous laws set forth in the old testament. I note you STILL have not managed to come up with any example, biblical or from any period source, of a womans bloodline being attributed as you claim marys ws, or of a man claiming a genetic link based on is mothers bloodline. That is because it DOES NOT EXIST. You are STILL making the same claim you did in your first post, but have STILL not managed to defend that claim. \n \n \n \nAnd you might consider looking at the work of renowned Biblical scholar Norman Geisler, who presents substantive evidence and arguments for the virgin birth, etc. His three part series can be found below. \n\n \n \"Renowned\" by whom? AFIK, Geisler is widely viewed as a a quack and an idiot as far as I know. If you are a big fan of Geislers, I can understand your debating style, though. There are notes about his debate with Farrell Till at http://www.skeptictank.org/debate.htm \n \n the full text of the debate is available at http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/farrell_till/geisler-till/index.shtml\n \n \n The files you link are a pretty good example of Geislers style. It is essentially a long article using the bible as the only source for verification of the virgin birth. this is a staggering logica fallacy, because it is the bible that is being quesitoned here. Using the disputed material to prove your point is a sure sign that either you have a weak argument, or you are a delusionsl idiot (or you are a delusional idiot with a weak argument). Teh only portion where he steps out of an endless line of biblical quotes is at the very end where he says:\n \n \n \nHistorical evidence that Jesus was supernaturally conceived of a virgin is more than substantial. Indeed, there are more eyewitness contemporary records of the virgin birth than for most events from the ancient world. The records show no signs of myth development. Indeed, they are surrounded by historical references to real people, places, and times. Thus, there is no reason to believe Jesus was not literally, biologically born of a virgin just as the Bible claims he was. Only an unjustified antisupernatural bias is ground for any conclusion to the contrary.\n\n \n The problem with this is that there are NO eyewitnesses to the virgin birth. There is NO eye witness account. In all the gospels, only Luke and Matthew actually MENTION a virgin birth. You would think that would have been important enough that some of the other disciples would have brought it up.\n \n He also fails to address the fact (as have you) that the references to historical events and people surrounding it are WRONG. As we already covered, Herod was dead before Quirinnus became the governer of Syria, or the fact that the romans did not have people return to their place fo birth to be counted or taxed (becuase that woudl be just plain stupid). Maybe most telling is the fact that he does not eplain the events that were claimed int eh bible, such as the fact that Herod (who we have already established was dead) ordered that all male children under the age of 2 be killed, when we have NO record of this AT ALL outside the bible, and it would EASILY have been the most atrocious act in all the world at the time. \n \n You would have to be an idiot to belive this, yet he claims that only an unjustified antisupernatural bias could account for disbelief. NONE of the facts line up on this AT ALL.\n \n Since you still have not answered the questions, I guess I will just keep re-posting them here, and in every other thread you post in until you answer them. Come on, Easy, convince me of the error of my ways! Aren't you supposed to be converting people or brainwashing them or some such thing? Stop being a failure to your god and answer the questions. I'll tell you wht, you come up with a logical explanation for these things that you can actually back up with some kind of evidence, and I will go to church every sunday for 6 months and join a bible study group.\n \n You STILL have not explained why it specifically says that is Josephs bloodline. You have STILL not explained or shown an example in the bible, or anywhere else, where a \"son in law\" is referred to as a \"son\" in a geneaology. You still have not explained Why they would be discussing Marys bloodline at all, since the womans bloodline was considered irrelevant (which is why the bible is full of kings marrying common women).\n \n \n Additionally, you STILL have not explained who exactly bought the field with that silver. The two stories presented are MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. In the one, the PRIESTS buy the field, in the other JUDAS bought the field. In one, Judas hangs himself, in the other he does not. Your response is an utter failure since it does not address the contradiction.

   "The Scarlet Cloth / Thread \n \n Quoted from JCNT:84, re: Mt 27.51:\n \n \"The parokhet in the Temple. Exodus 26:31-35 describes this curtain as it existed in the desert Tabernacle. It separated the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies. Only the cohen hagadol was allowed to pass through it into the Holy of Holies; and that he could do only once a year, on Yom-Kippur, to make an atonement sacrifice for his sins and for the sins of the Jewish people. When it was ripped in two from top to bottom it symbolized the fact that God was giving everyone access to the most holy place of all in heaven, as taught explicitly at MJ 9:3-9, 10:19-22 [that's \"Hebrews\" for us goyim,)].\n \n The Talmud bears an amazing witness to the work of Yeshua in altering the system of atonement. The background is that on Yom-Kippur, when the cohen hagadol sacrificed a bull (Leviticus 16), a piece of scarlet cloth was tied between its horns. If it later turned white, it meant that God had forgiven Israel's sin in accordance with Isaiah 1:18, \"Though your sins be as scarlet, they will be white as snow.\"\n \n \"Our Rabbis taught that throughout the forty years that Shim'on the Tzaddik served,... the scarlet cloth would become white. From then on it would sometimes become white and sometimes not.... Throughout the last forty years before the Temple was destroyed... the scarlet cloth never turned white.\" (Yoma 39a-39b)\n \n Thus in the days of Shim'on Tzaddik the sacrificial system established by God in the Tanakh was observed, and it was effective. But afterwards Israel's spirituality declined, so that the sacrificial system was effective only sometimes. Finally, after Yeshua's death, forty years before the destruction of the Temple, it was never effective. The Talmud does not say it, but what had become effective for forgiving Israel's sin was the sacrificial death of Yeshua the Messiah.\"\n \n http://www.christian-thinktank.com/dveil.html\n \n Jesus is Lord!",

   "Helping out daewoo and the skeptics....\n \n \n The Bible\n Its History and Reliability\n \n Continuity:\n \n 1. The Bible was written by the inspiration of God over a 1,500 year time span, from approximately 1,400 B.C. to 100 A.D.\n 2. It was written by over forty different authors from every walk of life including kings, peasants, philosophers, fishermen, poets, statesmen, and scholars. Among those authors was:\n Moses, a religious and political leader educated in the universities of Egypt.\n Peter, a fisherman.\n Amos, a herdsman\n Luke, a physician.\n Matthew, a tax collector.\n Daniel, a prime minister.\n Nehemiah, a king's cupbearer.\n Paul, a tentmaker and Jewish rabbi.\n 3. The Bible was written on three continents - Europe, Asia, and Africa.\n 4. It was written in three languages - Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek.\n 5. It was written in times of peace and times of war; in the wilderness, in the cities, and in the dungeons and prisons of various municipalities and regimes.\n 6. It contains hundreds of sometimes extremely controversial subjects, yet exhibits a uniformity of consensus on those subjects, among its authors, from one end of the Bible to the other, a most unlikely occurrence.\n 7. The Bible has been read by more people and published in more languages than any other book in history.\n \n Composition of the Bible:\n \n The Bible is divided into two main sections - the Old Testament, which contains thirty-nine different books, from Genesis to Malachi - and the New Testament, which contains twenty-seven books, from Matthew to Revelation. \n \n The Old Testament can be divided into three main sections: (1) History and law; from Genesis to Esther; (2) the psalms and the poetic books, from Job to the Song of Solomon; (3) the writings of the prophets, from Isaiah to Malachi.\n \n In the New Testament, you have two main divisions: (1) the gospels and New Testament history, from Matthew to Acts; (2) the doctrinal epistles, which for the most part were written to specific churches and individuals in the Jewish and Christian communities, and which include explanations of Christian doctrines and works of prophecy.\n \n Even though the Bible was written over a fifteen-hundred year time span by over forty different authors, there are only three main themes: (1) God, and the story of his creation; (2) The history of mankind, from Adam and Israel to the New Testament church; (3) and most significantly, God's plan for the eternal redemption of mankind through Jesus Christ.\n \n Evidence for the Divine Reliability of the Bible:\n \n It's fair and appropriate to ask the questions: \"What is the evidence that the Bible is the inspired and reliable word of God?\" \"And why should we believe that the Bible that we read today is in anyway similar to what was actually written over 3,000 years ago?\" \n \n The Bibiographical Test:\n \n The bibliographical test for the reliability of the Bible is an examination of the textual transmission by which ancient documents reach us today. In other words, not having the original documents and scrolls of the Bible, how reliable are the copies of those documents that we have today?\n \n Concerning the quality of today's existing manuscripts, it should be noted that in the beginning, the Old Testament was written primarily in Hebrew, and the Hebrews were extremely zealous about protecting the integrity and continuity of God's word. Original scrolls and manuscripts were painstakingly copied. The copiers were called scribes (note Jeremiah and his scribe Baruch). The scribes were so concerned about the accuracy of the manuscript copies that they counted all the verses and even the individual letters of each scroll, and if when they finished their count didn't exactly agree with the original text, the scribes had to either meticulously correct the manuscript or start the whole process over again. Each scroll had to have a certain number of lines per inch, and the distance between letters had to be the same on every scroll. Copies were proofread and compared for accuracy with the original. Only when there was a consensus among two or three professional copyists and elders was the new copy authorized for distribution. The penalty for falsification or error in a completed manuscript was usually severe.\n \n Around the year 250 B.C the Hebrew scrolls were translated into a Greek Bible known as the Septuagint, and in 400 A.D. it was translated into Latin by Jerome in Bethlehem into what is known as the Vulgate Bible. For a thousand years this was the standard Bible of the Roman Catholic Church. Not until the late 1,300's did John Wycliff, a renowned English scholar, and his friends translate the Bible into English. Finally, in 1,611, under the decree of King James I of England, forty different scholars came together and gave us the now famous \"King James Version.\" Each translation was an exhaustive and meticulous process so that the integrity of the original scriptures could be accurately preserved.\n \n In the late 1940's and early 50's, a series of important archaeological discoveries was made. Over 400 ancient Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek religious scrolls and fragments were discovered in Qumran, west of the Dead Sea in Israel. Included were manuscript copies of every Old Testament Book, except for the book of Esther, all dating to no later than 70 A.D. Today, at the Shrine of the Book Depository in Israel you can view the now famous \"Isaiah Scroll,\" which is 24 feet long and 10 inches high, and is dated to at least 150 B.C. It is the oldest complete Old Testament manuscript in existence, and with very few insignificant differences, it matches the Book of Isaiah as we read it today. \n \n As for quantity of manuscripts, notably of the New Testament, Bruce Metzger, one of the worlds premier scholars at Princeton Theological Seminary, said, \"The quantity of New Testament material is almost embarrassing in comparison with other works of antiquity. Next to the New Testament, the greatest amount of manuscript testimony is of Homer's Iliad, written in 900 B.C.....of which there are fewer than 650 existing Greek manuscript copies today, the oldest dating to 400 B.C., a time-span difference of about 500 years between when the original work was written and when the oldest existing copy dates from.\" Conversely, we have over 5,000 copies of manuscripts and fragments of the New Testament, dating to as early as 40 years after the death and resurrection of Christ.\n \n The Internal and External Evidence Tests:\n \n In the internal evidence test, we have to ask the question, \"Does the Bible, from Genesis to Revelation, provide an internal harmony of consensus on the hundreds of various topics and doctrines that we find within it?\" The answer to that, and the overwhelming evidence, says, \"yes, it does.\" Some people say that the Bible is full of contradictions, but when you intensively study those \"alleged\" contradictions, you usually just find more evidence that the Bible is accurate. For instance, in the Gospel of Luke (Ch. 18) it says that Jesus was going into Jericho when he healed a blind man, but in the Gospel of Mark (10:46) it says that Jesus was leaving Jericho when this happened. So the skeptics point out this contradiction and use it to try to discredit the Bible. But the issue can be resolved by realizing that in the time of Christ there were two Jericho's - the ruins of the old one from the days of Joshua, and the new, rebuilt Jericho just a few miles away. So it was just a matter of perspective by the gospel writers - both statements can be true at the same time. And that's the type of thing you ultimately find when investigating Bible difficulties. (Note: many books on this subject).\n \n As for the external evidence for the reliability of the Bible, historians, scholars, and archaeologists have externally confirmed the major portion of the authenticity of the Bible. Nelson Glueck, a world famous archaeologist, once commented, \"It may be categorically stated that no archaeological discovery has ever controverted a single bible passage.\" Ancient cities previously known to have existed only in the Bible are routinely excavated. Almost invariably, whenever there is a new archaeological discovery, it confirms, rather than conflicts, with what's written in the Bible. Today, you can visit Israel and walk through Hezekiah's Tunnel (mentioned in 2 Kings 20:20), visit the ruins of Jericho, see the remains of the Temple Mount foundation, visit Jacob's Well and the Pool of Siloam, see the remains of the stables of Solomon, and even visit the burned out remains of the recently discovered city of Hazor (Joshua 11), previously known to have existed only in the Bible.\n \n Is the Bible the Word of God?\n \n All these things give substantial and credible evidence that the Bible is historically accurate, but how do we know that it was authored by God? \n \n 1. The Bible and it's writers specifically state that the Bible is the word of God. 2nd Timothy 3:16 says that, \"All scripture is God-breathed (inspired by God) and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting, and training in righteousness....\"\n \n 2. Over 3,800 times in the Bible it says, \"Thus sayeth the Lord,\" or \"Then the Lord said to Moses,\" etc.\n \n 3. There is the \"more sure word of Bible prophecy,\" - hundreds upon hundreds of fulfilled prophecies, that foretell of the rise and fall of individuals, nations, and that give clear and convincing evidence beyond chance probability that only someone divine could be the author. For instance, there are somewhere between three and five-hundred Old Testaments prophecies about a coming Messiah (Christ). These prophecies paint a portrait of him so clear, and so compelling, that not only is the place of his birth foretold, but also the exact time when he would appear - that he would be born of a virgin, that he would be the Son of God, and that he would give sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf, be crucified for the sins of the people, be rejected by his own people, and even rise from the dead. All these things are now confirmed to have been written many centuries before his birth.\n \n 4. The Bible has been supernaturally preserved through time for our edification, and over the centuries it has routinely withstood the attacks of skeptics and infidels, and yet today it continues to stand as solid as a rock. H. L. Hastings is quoted as saying, \"Sir, the Church of God is an anvil that has worn out many hammers. And so the hammers of the infidels have been pecking away at this book for ages, but the hammers are worn out, and the anvil still endures. If this book had not been the book of God, men would have destroyed it long ago. Emperors and popes, kings and priests, princes and rulers have all tried their hand at it; they die and the book still lives.\"\n \n 5. And finally, people for the last 2,000 years have testified about the supernatural and life-changing events that have taken place in their lives when they have confessed Christ as their Savior and been filled with the Holy Spirit. Thousands, if not millions of people have given their lives as martyrs rather than deny Christ and the Bible. It is a most compelling and reassuring testimony that we have from the pages of history.\n \n In closing, consider this evidence from the Books of Genesis and Revelation - the beginning and the end of the Bible:\n \n In Genesis, the sun is created; in Revelation the sun is not needed, for God himself will give us light. In Genesis Satan is victorious; in Revelation he is defeated. In Genesis sin enters the human race; in Revelation sin is banished. In Genesis people run and hide from God; in Revelation they are invited to live with God forever. In Genesis people are cursed; in Revelation the curse is removed. In Genesis tears are shed, with sorrow for sin; in Revelation there is no more sin, and no more tears and no more sorrow. In Genesis the fruit of the Tree of Life is not to be eaten; in Revelation people may eat of the Tree of Life. In Genesis, paradise is lost; in Revelation paradise is regained. And in Genesis, people are doomed to physical and spiritual death; in Revelation, believers live forever with their Creator.\n \n Jesus is Lord!",

   "The Temple Scroll and Crucifixion\n \n The following relates to \"The Temple Scroll\" (11QT - one of the Dead Sea Scrolls found at Qumran). The significance of what was found in this first century scroll confirms that the Jews of Jesus' time recommended and endorsed crucifixion for those whom they believed violated their religious beliefs. This evidence strongly counters the arguments of those who suggest that crucifixion was purely a Roman practice and that Jewish authorities therefore could not have been instrumental in recommending the crucifixion for Jesus.\n \n .....the Temple Scroll is evidence that the Jews practiced crucifixion against their own people during the period of Jesus' lifetime. In particular, column 64 describes in some detail the Essene understanding of Deuteronomy 21:22-23 which says:\n \n \"When someone is convicted of a crime punishable by death and is executed, and you hang him on a tree, fall night upon the tree; you shall bury him that same day, for anyone hung on a tree is under God's curse. You must not defile the land that the Lord your God is giving you for possession.\"\n \n The Essene interpretation of this passage is found in the Damascus Document 64.6-12 \n \n \"Thus you shall eradicate all evil in your midst, and all the children of Israel shall hear it and fear. If there were to be a spy against his people who betrays his people to a foreign nation or causes evil against his people, you shall crucify him and he will die. On the evidence of two witnesses and on the evidence of three witnesses shall he be executed and they shall crucify him. If there were a man with a sin punishable by death and he escapes amongst the nations and curses his people, the children of Israel, he also you shall crucify and he shall die. Their corpses shall not spend the night on the tree; instead you shall bury them that day because they are cursed by God and man, those crucified; thus you shall not defile the land which I give you.\"\n \n Perhaps the question has arisen in the reader's mind at this point, \"what does this have to do with Jesus?\" Well, the New Testament bears witness to the fact that Jesus was executed primarily because the Jews were angry at him because of his Sabbath practices and claims of deity. This Qumran text bears witness to the fact that crucifixion was used against those who \"defiled\" the land; and Sabbath breaking was defilement! Such defilers are cursed by God! \n \n While it is clear that the Romans in fact crucified Jesus, that the Jewish leadership participated is also undeniable. Of course the actual order was reserved for the Roman prefect. But Jesus was handed over for execution only after the Jews had decided that he must be executed. \n \n http://www.theology.edu/journal/volume3/crucify.htm",

   "The Scarlet Cloth / Thread \n \n Quoted from JCNT:84, re: Mt 27.51:\n \n \"The parokhet in the Temple. Exodus 26:31-35 describes this curtain as it existed in the desert Tabernacle. It separated the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies. Only the cohen hagadol was allowed to pass through it into the Holy of Holies; and that he could do only once a year, on Yom-Kippur, to make an atonement sacrifice for his sins and for the sins of the Jewish people. When it was ripped in two from top to bottom it symbolized the fact that God was giving everyone access to the most holy place of all in heaven, as taught explicitly at MJ 9:3-9, 10:19-22 [that's \"Hebrews\" for us goyim,)].\n \n The Talmud bears an amazing witness to the work of Yeshua in altering the system of atonement. The background is that on Yom-Kippur, when the cohen hagadol sacrificed a bull (Leviticus 16), a piece of scarlet cloth was tied between its horns. If it later turned white, it meant that God had forgiven Israel's sin in accordance with Isaiah 1:18, \"Though your sins be as scarlet, they will be white as snow.\"\n \n \"Our Rabbis taught that throughout the forty years that Shim'on the Tzaddik served,... the scarlet cloth would become white. From then on it would sometimes become white and sometimes not.... Throughout the last forty years before the Temple was destroyed... the scarlet cloth never turned white.\" (Yoma 39a-39b)\n \n Thus in the days of Shim'on Tzaddik the sacrificial system established by God in the Tanakh was observed, and it was effective. But afterwards Israel's spirituality declined, so that the sacrificial system was effective only sometimes. Finally, after Yeshua's death, forty years before the destruction of the Temple, it was never effective. The Talmud does not say it, but what had become effective for forgiving Israel's sin was the sacrificial death of Yeshua the Messiah.\"\n \n http://www.christian-thinktank.com/dveil.html\n \n Jesus is Lord!\n\n \n \n The quoting out of context of the Talmud is dishonest. .. and of course, is an avoidance of what was being discussed. \n \n If you look at the talmud, you will not see 'Yeshua the messiah' mentioned at all. Your dishonesty, and that of the computer Jockey Glenn Miller is legendary.\n \n FOr that matter. Yoma 39A states \n \n\n The one who sanctifies himself a little, Heaven help to sanctify him much\n \n\n \n As for Yoma 39B\n \n From Outreach Judaism \n \n\n Tractate Yoma4 is wholly given over to laws pertaining to Yom Kippur. Although missionaries cite the above statement which appears on page 39b, the discussion leading up to this quote begins on the previous page, 39a. Quoting from a Baraisa, the Talmud begins with a discussion of the deteriorating spiritual condition of the Jewish people during the second Temple period. Throughout this fascinating discourse, the miraculous events that transpired during the Temple ceremonies are the barometer by which the Baraisa measures the religious decline of the nation of Israel during this difficult epoch in Jewish history. The period of time examined in this assessment begins with the era during which Shimon HaTzaddik5 officiated as the high priest until the time that the Romans destroyed the second Temple in the year 70 C.E. More specifically, the Talmud breaks this period down into three successive stages, with the first stage being the most meritorious, the second marking a gradual spiritual decline, and the third the most deleterious.\n \n The Baraisa begins by recounting the miraculous events that repeatedly occurred during the forty years when Shimon HaTzaddik officiated as high priest. The Baraisa then continues to relate how the appearance of these miracles progressively diminished in the years that followed his death. These events are as follows:\n \n 1) The lot inscribed \"LaHashem,\" would always appear in the right hand of the high priest6 during the Yom Kippur service.\n \n 2) The strip of scarlet-dyed wool which was tied to the head of the scapegoat always turned white during the Yom Kippur service.\n \n 3) The western-most lamp of the Temple menorah remained lit until the priest would use its fire to kindle the next day's lamps.\n \n 4) The pyre on the altar did not require any additional wood to sustain a strong fire. \n \n 5) There was a blessing upon the first fruits of the Omer, the two loaves offered on Shevuoth, and on the loaves of the showbread so that each priest was satisfied with a portion no larger than the size of an olive.\n \n The faithfulness and goodwill that Shimon HaTzaddik embodied during his public tenure as high priest profoundly inspired the nation. His most famous maxim was, \"The world exists on three things: the Torah, divine worship, and acts of kindness.\" (Pirkay Avot 1:2) He is described as a person who took great thought and consideration regarding his fellow man.7 His extraordinary character affected the people deeply, and this manifested itself with a host of miraculous phenomena in the Temple, the House of Shimon's dedication. \n \n Following his death, however, the Jewish people were unable to sustain the spiritual heights which they had achieved during Shimon HaTzaddik's lifetime. As a result, they digressed into a downward spiritual spiral from which they never recovered. This decline continued and worsened as the second Temple era continued to unfold. The Baraisa therefore relates that after the death of Shimon HaTzaddik the occurrence of these miracles became sporadic; there were some years when these miraculous signs occurred, and there were other years when they did not. This spiritual decay plunged to its lowest point during the last 40 years of the second Temple period. The Baraisa records that none of the above miracles occurred during these last four decades of the second Temple. \n \n The question that immediately comes to mind is: In what dreadful sins did the children of Israel indulge during these last ill-famed 40 years of the second Temple that proved so devastating to their spiritual subsistence? What brought about the end of the miraculous events that were commonplace in the years that Shimon HaTzaddik served as high priest and periodically in the years that followed his death? \n \n With virtually no knowledge of the works of the Talmud, missionaries boldly insist that the scarlet ribbon not whitening relates to the crucifixion of Jesus. As you probably suspect by now, this contention is wholly without merit. Moreover, this Christian assertion entails a misuse of Jewish literature in order to advance a theology that is unknown to the Talmud. The Talmud, in fact, clearly and painfully records the sins that brought about the deplorable spiritual condition of the Jewish people during this last turbulent four decades of the second commonwealth. When quoting this Talmudic text, however, missionaries are careful to sidestep the crucial backdrop of this quote in the Talmud. By so doing, they deprive the uninitiated listener of indispensable knowledge and the vital tools to effectively respond to this argument.\n \n What makes the Christian use of this Talmudic quote so preposterous is the fact that the miracles in the Temple did not suddenly end in the year 30 C.E. as missionaries would have you think. On the contrary, the disappearance of miraculous phenomena began immediately following the death of Shimon HaTzaddik, which occurred many centuries before the destruction of the second Temple. In essence, there was not a sudden watershed event that caused supernatural events to end. The cessation of miraculous phenomena in the Temple was brought about by a slow spiritual decay among the Jewish people that lasted for many hundreds of years. \n \n",

   "The problem with worshipping Satan for me is that that religion has alot of really sick roots. I saw a documentary about Satanists, Witches, and Druids a few months ago. \n \n A few former Satanists told their stories. Basically, in the Satanist circles they were in, the Satanists sexually abused children, dismembered animals, sexually abused women, and murdered infants as sacrifices.\nWell I'm sorry but this is just plain wrong. \n \n Firstly 'Satanists, Witches, and Druids' are very very different people. Satanists follow LaVeyan philosophy or it's offshoots and exalt the individual and Satan usually as a personification of that. Witches and Druids can be members of various religions, usually a form of Paganism but not necessarily. Whilst there are some superficial similarities between them, they hold very different belief systems and do not appreciate being likened to each other in the same way a Christian would not like to be assumed to be the same as a Muslim. I can only speak for Satanism here but I think Anastasia could help with Wicca if she still posts, haven't seen her for a while.\n \n As for the actual 'sick' practices. Utter utter rubbish. Any form of abuse be it to an animal, child or adult is explicitly against the tenants of the religion. No Satanist would ever harm or sacrifice another creature in such a way, or condone such treatment. It goes against everything the religion stands for. Quite simply it is a media scare story that has NO basis whatsoever in truth, yet such misinformation continues to circulate. If you don't believe me consider the fact that in the US no Satanist has ever been convicted with religious abuse of any form, and the only one ever accused had the charges dropped. If such a thing was such a prevalent part of the religion do you not think that some evidence would actually exist.\n \n If you did see such a documentary, the 'Satanists' were either lying or they weren't Satanists. I've never seen a documentary like this, any documentary I've ever seen on the subject has been impartial and truthful. I have heard that a few were made, usually with a biased source providing the funding. I wouldn't give it time of day.\n \n For more info, and a damn good site:\n \n http://www.religioustolerance.org/",

   "Entropy, yes. Forgive a non-native speake.\nSure, didn't mean to nit-pick, just wanted to be sure we were talking about the same thing! \n \n \n \nAlthough this is about the extended meaning of the concept. In the long term, we'll run out of energy, freeze or wind up as a minuscule part of a mammoth black hole. Fighting this destiny is fighting entropy. The quest for eternity. Or at least the quest to prolong our existence. That is the essence of the fire that is life.\n \n We start as very selfish babies. Being selfish is easy. That's why the effort of humanity should center on the opposite - coexistence, cooperation. Of all the ideologies I have met, satanism is about as far from that as we have so far got.\n \n One point we get at least reasonably close is that this should be a rational choice. To me, it is. However, the rational must always consider the irrational, too, not only as a threat but also as a tool. The flawed foundations of religion do not mean that all of their ideas should be rejected - just the foundation, upon which they are built. Forgiveness and mercy work withoud gods and sins - they are very beneficial as they smooth out the functioning of a society and can often serve to resolve those issues when the society's function can become detrimental to the society itself.\nI see. And I agree with you totally. I see co-operation as a society as paramount too, that's why I work in the public sector. Because I want to see our society strive and grow, to me that is the most important thing there is. \n \n Satanism is not necessarily about selfishness in such a way however. It admits that humans as animals are all inherently selfish, true. Benevolence only works for a reason, to mindlessly say 'turn the other cheek' exposes one for abuse. Society must of course be benevolent for it to function, it also must be ruthless where appropriate. Either way it does this through reason, not mindless adherence to doctrine. That is all Satanism suggests. It admits that one should be benevolent for selfish means, ie the continued propagation of society. Exactly as you suggest.",

As Satan encapsulates all of these things then why not us Him as a symbol? \n \n But of course LaVey also grew up in show business. He understood how controversy sells. The Church would have had no where near the publicity or membership had it called itself something neutral. So the use of the term is not mystical as such, but a combination of appropriateness and, as you say, attention seeking!\n \n Personally the term makes me a bit uncomfortable myself.

I think orion has pointed out several times that the whole bizarre farrago is best explained as a retrospective rationalisation by his cult followers of their rabbi's unforeseen and ignominious termination.\n\n \n Hi, John. Good to see an old friend. \n \n Yes, the salvation by proxy argument appears to have been an attempt by Jesus' later followers to make sense out of his untimely death at the hand of the Romans. The disturbance in the temple on the eve of Passover and the fact that Jesus' followers called him \"King of the Jews\" was probably more than enough to seal his fate. Passover made the Romans nervous in any case, given that Jerusalem was packed with Jews, posing the threat of riots. To have someone busting tables in the temple courtyard at such time was almost certainly seen as a threat to peace and stability. Furthermore, a 'king' would be expected to liberate his people from foreign domination, a consideration which probably did not escape the attention of the Romans. \n \n In all probability, there was no trial of Jesus. It's more likely that Pilate asked one of his officers to get rid of this guy Jesus. He was then crucified, according to custom, after which his body was probably thrown into a garbage dump, again, according to custom. Denial of a proper burial was part of the punishment dictated by the Romans.",
