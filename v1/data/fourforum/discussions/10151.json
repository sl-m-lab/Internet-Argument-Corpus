Whatever the sin or sins may be if we will truly submit our lives to His will and trust Him completely. \n \n If any believer refuses to submit to God and continually grieves the Holy Spirit, God will give them over to their lusts unto destruction in order to preserve them for eternity.\n\n \n Tell me Kronus, what about my response to the OP is anything but RIGHT ON TOPIC ?

   "Originally Posted by Archangel;274883 MY RESPONSE TO OP \n First of all, Jesus never taught to be tolerant of sin at all, ever. Not once. But with that said, He taught forgiveness, submission to the will of God and trust in His will for our lives. Now, as to the question, can an actively gay person be saved, as in Born Again ? I absolutely believe he can. Just as an active adulterer can be born again. Sin is sin to God and He loves us all equally. Here's the proverbial catch that keeps all sinners honest though. \n\n \n I'm with Kronos on this one.\n \n The original question was whether a person can be gay and a Christian at the same time. You answered the question of whether an actively gay person can be saved (Born Again).\n \n However, extrapolating from previous experience of your opinions on this matter, does your answer mean that this person can continue to be gay whilst still being a Christian, or does it mean that this person was gay, but has now been saved and can now be a true Christian?\n \n I suspect that it is the latter. So your answer should have been that a person cannot be gay and a Christian, but that they could have been saved from being gay and be a Christian.\n \n Am I right?\n \n I realise that you would say that they could still be gay if they didn't practice their deviance, but we all know that this is just you squirming to hide your inner hatred.emoticon_xkill \n \n Smiley",

You answered the question of whether an actively gay person can be saved (Born Again)\n\n \n You obviously aren't aware of this but being born again is the definition of what a TRUE Christian is. \n \n \n, extrapolating from previous experience of your opinions on this matter, does your answer mean that this person can continue to be gay whilst still being a Christian, or does it mean that this person was gay, but has now been saved and can now be a true Christian?\n\n \n You see ? You people really don't have the ability to comprehend what I say. It really is beyond you. Because I said that a gay can be saved and continue in his/her sin. see ?\n Either salvation is a truly FREE gift or it isn't. Either it is based on Gods GRACE or it isn't. So the scriptural answer is that a sexually active gay person can be active and saved. But I submit to you that just as happened to Michael Glatze who could no longer actively practice homosexuality as a believer, found the power to change his lifestyle through the Holy Spirit which indwells him as a child of God. A gay who gets saved will be totally convicted by the Holy Spirit just as a straight who continued in Adultery would be convicted of that sin. \n \nI suspect that it is the latter. So your answer should have been that a person cannot be gay and a Christian, but that they could have been saved from being gay and be a Christian\n\n \n As you can see above, I said the exact opposite. What good does it do to write arguments if you are unable to read ?\n \n \nAm I right?\n You are never right smiley!!!\n \n \nI realise that you would say that they could still be gay if they didn't practice their deviance, but we all know that this is just you squirming to hide your inner hatred.emoticon_xkill \n \n Smiley\n\n \n No, I said that they could never be fulfilled, victorious christians as long as they were grieving the Holy Spirit within them, and that like a straight person who continued in sin, God would turn them over to the destruction of the flesh in order to preserve them for eternity. Do yourself a favor smiley and actually read the post in question. And take off your hateful bigoted glasses and really read it.

Because if they were truly a Christian I don't think they'd be able to live in that way with a clear conscience. That's not to say that there aren't Christians that are gay in the sense of having that as a sexual orientation--that's a different matter, and so the distinction between gay in the sense of having an orientation and practicing by living out the behavior is a critical distinction here.\n\n \n I think this is a meaningless distinction.

   "[QUOTE=samiinh;275091]What does it matter?[quote]\n It doesn't. Unless you're interested in the subject.\n \n \nThe pope in Rome has recently reasserted that \"other\" Christian communities are either defective or not true churches. Defective! The only problem that I see with this assertion is that the pope left out one church in his criticism. I guess there are no mirrors at the Vatican.\n\n Nearly All religions often state that they are the one true path. Why not? it's logical to do so. If they weren't, then the followers would/ could leave to find the one true path...or, at least an easier and more enjoyable path to follow.\n \n \nIt was also asserted from on high that Catholicism provides the only true path to salvation. Well, salvation from what? Oh wait, I remember now, the fires of hell and eternal damnation. Oh my!\n\n I was just thinking on starting a thread in the religion section entitled \"What do I need Saving from? and Why?\n \n \nAbout 100 years ago, someone asked my favorite American if he believed in eternal punishment. Robert Ingersoll replied, \"Well no. I always thought that God could get his vengeance in far less time.\" Sweet!\n\n I happen to be my own favorite American. I'm also my own favorite Human.\n The reason why there are no mirrors in the Vatican is because I stole them all. During daylight...when the vampires there were resting. ;)\n \n \nIt is interesting to note that these recent assertions from the pope are nothing new but are being proclaimed just as the church has agreed to pay at least $660 million because children in its care were sexually abused. Even more curious is that some of the sheep in Los Angeles are fretting over the fact that a few of the churches may have to close down because of the lawsuit. (As if the Vatican is broke.) The church must be protected as the children are sacrificed.\n\n The 660 is only the L.A CA. settlement (1.3 million per plaintiff). The current total is 2 billionish and expected to rise.\n I wish I was abused for that kind of money.\n \n \nAre there no limits on absurdity?\n\n I hope not!\n \n \nMormons have been taught to believe that the American Indians were the descendants of ancient Israelites. DNA proves that this is not correct. The American Indians descended from East Asia People.\n\n And the Garden of Eden is here too!\n \n \nThe whole point is that religion is just a man-made thing. It isn't rational and it isn't real. It is hogwash. Why waste your time.\n\n NO! It's a gift from the god(s). It's veeerrryy rational. \n Waste of time...pshaaaw! \n If the Catholics can blow 2 billion on sex toys, think of the money they've accumulated! Look at the evangelical market. Look at religion as a whole. Like walking into a XXX sex shop...catering to all kinds.\n Mo Money, Mo Money...",

Religion and spirituality are personal matters, and so there's no reason who someone shouldn't make their own decisions about what they think is correct, including to decide to simply believe whatever their priest says.\n\n The law DOESN'T apply to everyone. Only Americans born into it or who came her and joined.\n Just as the bible doesn't apply to everyone. Only those under it. Only recently (past several decades+) has this 'Personal' religion concept in Christianity been pushed. Prior to that, you're born into in and it was shoveled down your throat. Even non-believers were (and are) often subjected to laws passed based on the Christian bible. Just like other religions dominated other lands. \n If you recall, in Leviticus, the laws handed down for the Israelites to Moses by God were for all who lived in their lands, including 'aliens/ foreigners'.\n \n I agree with you that people can pick and chose what they want to believe but I'd say it's dishonest to make something up, or pick and chose from something existing and trying to pass yourself off as 'unaltered'.\n Most New Agers I knew did this yet, at least had the decency to admit that that's what they did, make new religions.\n \n If I were to encounter 4 different 'Christians' who all gave me different descriptions on what a Christian is, what should I do?\n Personally, I look at their instruction manuel.\n \n Seriously, it can get hard keeping track of who's what kind of 'Christian'.\n \n At the very least, there should be further descriptions for the subdivisions.\n Like Jo being a \"'Red Word' only Christian\".",

No sin entering and no need for a savior for such sin. It's this reason that you have Arch and other fundies fighting hard against reality and proclaiming that evolutionists are anti-Christians and Satanists. \n Remove prohibitions on behavior and such and you get to the point where anyone can get a passing grade and freely enter into the kingdom of heaven regardless of anything they have done. Not even needing to proclaim that Jesus is the one true way. So, why bother not killing people who #### me off? Why not bothering practicing scrying and fortune telling? Sure, MAN's laws may punish me...but who cares? I have an etenity of reward awaiting me.\n It's not that it MUST be...it simply IS. \n While Arch's beliefs are easily proven to be nonsensical in context of the reality we inhabit, unfortunatly in context of the system they are found, they make remarkable sense and are logical. There is why and wherefore.\n When looking at the water downed version that liberal present, it sounds (on the surface) to be prettier and easier to accept...but some of the why's and wherefors have been removed...making the who (in context) sound illogical. If there is no Adam and Eve, where did this concept of sin arise? If it doesn't really exist why need salvation? If it's cool to bang another guy, just as it's cool to do needed work on the sabbath or eat certain types of foods, then why isn't it cool to follow false god(s) and practices. Why not steal when ever I feel like it...nothing really belongs to people...it's ALL GOD'S and he gived freely to everyone. No?\n \n As for the parts that make sense on their own...I can find that simple truth reflected elsewhere. I don't even need a religion to learn it. It's incidental. The added point to Ecc. is that all is pointless without God. Which is bogus for me. So, why bother trying to glean truths from a book riddled with falsehoods? I can do better elsewhere...without picking and chosing.\n \n \nOk, I'll just touch on this, in addition to the above. The answer is, don't keep track.

   "I disagree, Zardoz. The idea that salvation is a gift freely given, and not dependent on any sort of works, is far less comforting for the believer, because it requires that we do good not for any tangible reward, but because it is good and Christ asks it of us. Being able to threaten hellfire and damnation is a great comfort to the fundamentalist, it makes the world very neat, and allows the fundie the self-assurance that anyone disagreeing with them will get their comeuppance. The idea that we have a complete choice, that we must do or not do something solely based on what is right or wrong, not on any threat or promise, is a far more scary idea. It makes obedience to God genuinely a matter of love, not of fear or hatred.\n \n As to the importance of literal Genesis to the concept of salvation, I once again disagree. The story of Adam and Eve need not be literally true for it to be a good go at explaining what happened when humanity first became conscious, and began to have knowledge of God, and began to knowingly do things to benefit themselves at the expense of others. Our need for salvation is based on our repeated and, with but one known exception, universal capacity for sin.\n \n As far as picking and choosing what is valuable from the Bible, I would be interested to hear the views of the supposed literalists on sowing fields with mixed seeds and wearing clothing from mixed fibres, or any of the other myriad non food related prohibitions of mosaic law.",

And as for the \"standard\" to call one's self Christian, who sets that standard? I'm not talking about a specific church, I'm talking about simply calling one's self Christian.

   "I disagree, Zardoz. The idea that salvation is a gift freely given, and not dependent on any sort of works, is far less comforting for the believer, because it requires that we do good not for any tangible reward, but because it is good and Christ asks it of us. Being able to threaten hellfire and damnation is a great comfort to the fundamentalist, it makes the world very neat, and allows the fundie the self-assurance that anyone disagreeing with them will get their comeuppance. The idea that we have a complete choice, that we must do or not do something solely based on what is right or wrong, not on any threat or promise, is a far more scary idea. It makes obedience to God genuinely a matter of love, not of fear or hatred.\n\n You are correct, but when you accept that gift (accepting is an action...\"who so ever believes...\") you also repent and seek to not pile up further sin. Jesus gave the 2 commandments to simplify the others believing (very naievely) that if you could follow those 2, you'd also be following the others as well. \n The bible has a lot to say about faith. With passages stating you need it to pretty much do anything. \n And while I agree that love should be the primary focus in the relationship, there are numerous passages dealing with the fear of the Lord.\n \n Out of context of Christianity, I can say I much prefer a coherant but liberal attitude of you're type of Christianity. I have less to fear about and could look to mor easily manipulate you to assist in humanitarian works to better all free from compulsions or desire for a return. \n \n \nAs to the importance of literal Genesis to the concept of salvation, I once again disagree. The story of Adam and Eve need not be literally true for it to be a good go at explaining what happened when humanity first became conscious, and began to have knowledge of God, and began to knowingly do things to benefit themselves at the expense of others. Our need for salvation is based on our repeated and, with but one known exception, universal capacity for sin.\n\n So, being mean to one another is the 'sin'? When did God tell man this?\n If he didn't and it's some conscience based thing...could you elaborate.\n So far, it seems you're simply making up a story to tie your disjointed believe together. A nice sounding story (for these times) but, a new story none the less.\n \n \nAs far as picking and choosing what is valuable from the Bible, I would be interested to hear the views of the supposed literalists on sowing fields with mixed seeds and wearing clothing from mixed fibres, or any of the other myriad non food related prohibitions of mosaic law.\n\n I'd say many 'practical' laws were mixed in with spiritual ones as well as isolationistic laws to seperate your community and culture from others that could dominate.\n When the time to spread this faith was started by Jesus and Paul, sanitation could have improved, the enviroments more flexable (desert to savanah to temperate) and a host of other issues that had people lookinjg at most of these rules as burdensome. \n I personally avoid mixed fiber clothing (100% cotton when I can for example). \n And I'd not call myself a literalist but when something is mentioned repeatedly, such as sexual immorality, it's worth looking into.\n Same with things Jesus himself spoke about...considering He's allegedly the Messiah.\n \n Let's say homosexuality is okay with God. It could very well be that gay sex was simply unsanitary like eating pork or having a home with mold while living in an arid climate.\n Is fornication (sex outside of marriage)?\n Is Adultery (sex with someone while you or they are married to another)?\n If no, why?\n If they are not okay then how do you deal with gay people? Take them at theri word that they're gay and marry them to a same sex partner and then allow them to have sex? Same as for heteros.\n Then, suppose either of those 2 pairings realize that they were wrong. That they aren't gay or hetero. How do you deal with that?\n Jesus said himself that the only good reason to divorce and remarry is by adultery. Paul echos this also. \n \n So far as I can gather, your ideas of sin seem to be 'being bad to other people'. \n \n \n \n In the end, from what I gather, many people are simply making stuff up and claiming 'It works for me so it must be true' or similar.\n And in discarding some parts of th bible, I'm often wondering why?\n Why chose those parts to discard and others to keep?\n Why is gayness okay now after several dozen centuries?\n Should new books be added to the bible to clarify this?",

Why not simply ignore it?\n \n \n\n If you're primarily using that as your instruction manuel for your spirituality, what gives you the gumption to pick and choose?.\n\n Gumption?

Homosexual practices can do the same. \n Look at the distrust placed on homosexuals over the centuries. Is that unjustly placed? \n Have homosexuals changed their ideas and practices to be more acceptable over the ages. From being flamming, party people to being normal people who simply are attracted to each other?\n It very well could be simple sanitation issues or basic logic of man + woman = babies...no babies, what's the point (they may say).\n What I see is you're basically following a primitive desert religion that's gotten too big for it's britches. It makes no real sense and the gems in it can be more easily mined from other sources or founded independent of it. \n \n @Kronos, when you pick and choose, you're changing fundamentals of the subject. \n Like the air example, If I remove certain elements, it's no longer 'air'.\n Somethings like neon are insignificant but, when you remove other basic elements like oxygen, nitrogen or hydrogen...you get something that simply isn't 'air'. \n A real example of this picking and chosing and reinventing are with the Jehovah's Witnesses and the Mormons/ LDS. \n They've picked and chosen (as have other semi-Christian groups) yet, they have the honesty to at least openly admit it and even make claims to a new religion.\n That's pretty much what I'd ask for.\n If you're going to significantly pick and chose to the point where your belief system bears little resemblance to the original, at least have the courtesy to call it something different.\n Voodoo, LDS, JW's, New Agers. Many others venerate Jesus and follow aspects of Christianity but have done this 'choosing' (and in some cases melding other practices into it) to the point where they warrant new titles.\n On these very forums, AA, SP, Jo and several other self-professed Christians bear little resemblence to one another. The only common denominator is they all still cling to the word 'Christian'. And there are strong social reasons for doing so. \n I see it as inherantly dishonest. Christianity is clearly defined and it goes beyong the 'Jesus' claims.\n If you got out to many different church types for any extended period of time, you'd know there is a huge difference between Oneness Pentecostals and Catholics. Without knowing the details, if you were to really believe in this after life thing and want to please God by following dutifully, which sect would you chose?\n And like in the US...ignorance of the law really is no excuse. Regardless of what pseudo-Christians try to tell you.\n If you deny the Trinity nature of God as oneness do simply because the word Trinity isn't in the bible (but the definition is) and someone said it was a pagan practice, how would your God think? Same with homosexuality. The term Homosexual wasn't used until the past hundred years or so but the definition is in the bible. Lumped in with sexual immorality issues which are spoken of at length.\n For all we really know, you could get into big doo-doo for wearing mixed fiber clothing. The bible DOES say you'll ALSO be judged according to your acts/ deeds. \n \n So, yes, from human perspectives, many issues could simply be explained and the prohibitions installed rational for the times.\n But, the opposite could be true too. God wanted the bans for what ever mystical reason. To simply have humans obey. To trust in Him even in issues that seem nonsensical.\n And, when you're dealing with God, are you really going to argue?\n You think it's going to get you anywhere?",

You choose to interpret the Bible in a way that you personally find convenient, and then you use the Bible to point fingers at gay people. Shame on you.\n\n \n This entire post of yours shows a fundamental lack of understanding about the passages in the Bible regarding slavery. Just because passages were once used to justify slavery does not mean they were done so accurately and correctly.\n \n Let's take a moment to look at a couple of oft-used passages to claim the Bible supports slavery, shall we ...\n \"When you buy a Hebrew slave, six years shall he serve; and in the seventh shall he go out free, for nothing. If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were married, then his wife shall go out with him. If his master has given him a wife, and she has borne him sons or daughters, the wife and the children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself. And if the slave shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free: then his master shall bring him unto God, and he shall bring him to the door or unto the door-post, and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl, and he shall be his slave forever.\" -Exodus 21:2-6.\n \n \"Slaves, obey your earthly masters with fear and trembling, with a sincere heart, as you would Christ, not by the way of eye-service, as people-pleasers, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart.\" -Ephesians 6:5-6.\n On the surface, it can look like this \"supports\" slavery, particularly if the critic is looking to find that in the passage. But with a closer examination in the context of the time you would see that the first passage actually commands slaves ve set free after a time, rather than the norm of indefinite servitude. So this passage is actually a liberating one for slaves. Without it, they'd be stuck as slaves for the rest of their lives.\n \n The 2nd passage has to be viewed in the context of the Christian life and relationship with God. It's not a statement saying slavery is ok. That's never said there at all. It's a passage about conduct, recommending that slaves continue on in their service with sincerity since they are stuck in the predicament anyway and there's little they could do about it. \n \n So neither of these passages really condones slavery.\n \n Also, if you really were out to put forth a balanced picture here (being that you claim to supposedly be a history professor), you'd note that the abolitionist movement also used the Bible against slavery, so there's a whole other historically precedented way to view it than the one you've put forward here. A verse oft-used by abolitionists was 1 Timothy 1:10, which lists \"enslavers\" along with a bunch of other sins. It is somewhat ironic that when critics of Christianity generalize and put down the Bible, they are putting down the basis of some quite notable figures in the abolitionist movement. \n \n But perhaps even more importantly, the whole gist of the Christian faith, as espoused in the New Testament would have to be anti-slavery by default. There is no way to reconcile the loving and compassionate statements of Christ and the epistle writers with the idea that it's ok for people to make slaves of each other. In the words of John Brown, a well-known abolitionist who unabashedly believed what he did from the Bible ...\n \n \"I see a book kissed here which I suppose to be the Bible, or at least the New Testament. That teaches me that all things whatsoever I would that men should do to me, I should do even so to them. It teaches me, further, to \"remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them.\" I endeavored to act up to that instruction. I say, I am yet too young to understand that God is any respecter of persons. I believe that to have interfered as I have done as I have always freely admitted I have done in behalf of His despised poor, was not wrong, but right. Now, if it is deemed necessary that I should forfeit my life for the furtherance of the ends of justice, and mingle my blood further with the blood of my children and with the blood of millions in this slave country whose rights are disregarded by wicked, cruel, and unjust enactments, I submit; so let it be done!\"\n \n I didn't mean to get sidetracked, but I see this claim that the Bible supports or condones slavery brought up a lot in the debate about homosexuality-related issues, and it's really just not that simple.",

It's a passage about conduct, recommending that slaves continue on in their service with sincerity since they are stuck in the predicament anyway and there's little they could do about it.\n\n \n LOL. If this doesn't codone slavery, I don't know what would. \n Are you really saying that the ALL MIGHTY GOD says, well since your in that predicament anyway, you should serve with sincerity. \n \n If God doesn't condone slavery, he would make it clear that slavery is not acceptable under ANY circumstance. Not for 6 years, not for 1 day. \n \n Well how about gays? Were in a predicament of being gay that we can't do anything about. Why doesn't he say, well since your in that predicament anyway, you should behave in a moral sincere way?",

   "No, the Bible contains many references to slavery that support the institution, in both the Old and New Testaments. Plenty of Christians pointed to the Bible in making their defense of slavery. \n \n You can say that the Bible does not condone slavery, but I can find far more passages supporting slavery than anyone can find opposing \"homosexuality,\" which is a term not even used when the various books of the Bible were written. \n \n You pick and choose, my friend. You choose to interpret the Bible as not condoning slavery, when those passages are quite clear. You choose to interpret the Bible in a way that you personally find convenient, and then you use the Bible to point fingers at gay people. Shame on you.\nI'm sorry reading something in context makes me \"pick and choose\". \n \n Even so, the fact still remains the Bible and God consider being gay a sin. Whether I \"pick and choose\" anything is irrelevant as the reality is still the same.",

Here is the message of the bible in its simplest form smiley; when we ALL get to the Judgement Seat of Christ we will be judged according to one of two standards only. ONE, according to the Law of the Old Testament, and all of these laws you are listing will be held against anyone who broke them and is subject to that Law. It doesn't matter if one is a Jew or Gentile because those Laws are Gods standard and that is all that matters. So the OT Law applies to everyone who dies without receiving Christ no matter what their personal beliefs in life were.\n \n Then there are the people who have accepted the New Testament offer of Grace by receiving what Jesus did on the Cross for us. They will be received not according to what they did or even their own goodness at all but according to what jesus did on the Cross when he died for our sins. I am saved, not because of anything I've done but because of what Jesus did for me. \n \n But the unsaved person must earn their way into heaven by rising to Gods perfect standard by living up to the Law. If the unsaved person fails in just one innocuous little law such as any ONE of the eight you listed above, then that person has failed to live up to Gods standards and will be cast into outer darkness for all eternity. Do you see why it is by Grace that we are saved and not by works, so that no man may boast ? It is a free gift of God to those who receive it. To those who don't, they must earn their way into heaven based on their own goodness. Speaking for myself only, I choose Grace because I know I have already fallen short of Gods Glory and could never live up to his standards. So if I tried to reach Him on my own merits I would fail miserably.\n \n So when unbelievers say that God is cruel because He rejects anyone who doesn't accept jesus, they are wrong in that assertion. And they would be right about God being cruel if they were right in their assertion. But God will allow every person who has rejected Jesus to qualify for Heaven on their own merits. All they must do is get past the Law and prove they lived up to it perfectly and completely. The choice is ours. I choose Grace because I know that the bible clearly says that, \"For all have sinned and fall short of the Glory of God, not one is worthy, not even one\". If that verse doesn't put it in perspective then nothing will.",

   "Didn't you understand my other post at all ? Here is the message of the bible in its simplest form smiley; when we ALL get to the Judgement Seat of Christ we will be judged according to one of two standards only. ONE, according to the Law of the Old Testament, and all of these laws you are listing will be held against anyone who broke them and is subject to that Law. It doesn't matter if one is a Jew or Gentile because those Laws are Gods standard and that is all that matters. So the OT Law applies to everyone who dies without receiving Christ no matter what their personal beliefs in life were.\n \n Then there are the people who have accepted the New Testament offer of Grace by receiving what Jesus did on the Cross for us. They will be received not according to what they did or even their own goodness at all but according to what jesus did on the Cross when he died for our sins. I am saved, not because of anything I've done but because of what Jesus did for me. \n \n But the unsaved person must earn their way into heaven by rising to Gods perfect standard by living up to the Law. If the unsaved person fails in just one innocuous little law such as any ONE of the eight you listed above, then that person has failed to live up to Gods standards and will be cast into outer darkness for all eternity. Do you see why it is by Grace that we are saved and not by works, so that no man may boast ? It is a free gift of God to those who receive it. To those who don't, they must earn their way into heaven based on their own goodness. Speaking for myself only, I choose Grace because I know I have already fallen short of Gods Glory and could never live up to his standards. So if I tried to reach Him on my own merits I would fail miserably.\n \n So when unbelievers say that God is cruel because He rejects anyone who doesn't accept jesus, they are wrong in that assertion. And they would be right about God being cruel if they were right in their assertion. But God will allow every person who has rejected Jesus to qualify for Heaven on their own merits. All they must do is get past the Law and prove they lived up to it perfectly and completely. The choice is ours. I choose Grace because I know that the bible clearly says that, \"For all have sinned and fall short of the Glory of God, not one is worthy, not even one\". If that verse doesn't put it in perspective then nothing will.\n\n \n Wow, it appears that I really didn't understand your previous post, but I'm pretty sure I understand you now. All I can say is that I am appalled by your beliefs.\n \n You are saying that you are saved because you have accepted that Christ died for you. This has been used as an excuse for centuries allowing Christians to rape, murder, steal etc, as long as they repented afterwards, then all was hunky-dory. The 'Word of God' means nothing to you.\n \n Well this certainly explains your behaviour on this forum. If your acts now mean nothing, then you can hurt anyone you like.\n \n I suspect that, if the Christian God really does exist (I don't for one minute believe that your personal god is one and the same), then you are going to be in for a very big shock. You'll turn up at that big party to end all parties, a big door will open and out will shuffle God.\n \n He will turn to the crowd and say, \"I have invited you all here, but few of you can stay.\n \n \"I created you all and gave you my message in many ways to suit your diverse cultures. Unfortunately, there were greedy men who chose to twist my message and use it for their own gains.\n \n \"Those of you who were able to see through this perversion, whose hearts saw my true message, are permitted to stay. Those who who were fooled and used my message to divide my people are free to leave.\n \n \"Put in the simplest terms possible, if you didn't understand that 'love thy neighbour' was the most important of my commandments, then you are not welcome at my table\".\n \n My belief is that, if there is any divine being up there, he will be judging us by our acts, not by what we say we believe. And that means all of us.\n \n Tough luck, Archie.\n \n emoticon_xangel Smiley emoticon_xangel",

   "http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/4968717.html \nA Cypress man charged in the death of a Southwest Airlines flight attendant said Saturday that he was doing God's work when he went to a Montrose-area bar last month, hunting for a gay man to kill.\n \n \"I believe I'm Elijah, called by God to be a prophet,\" said 26-year-old Terry Mark Mangum, charged with murder June 11. \" ... I believe with all my heart that I was doing the right thing.\"\n \n Interviewed in the Brazoria County Jail Saturday morning, Mangum said he feels no remorse for killing 46-year-old Kenneth Cummings Jr., whom relatives described as a \"loving\" son who never forgot a holiday and a devoted uncle who had set up college funds for his niece and nephew. He worked at Southwest for 24 years.\n \n Mangum, who described himself as \"definitely not a homosexual,\" said God called on him to \"carry out a code of retribution\" by killing a gay man because \"sexual perversion\" is the \"worst sin.\"\n \n Mangum believed Cummings to be gay.\n \n \"I planned on sending him to hell,\" he said.\n \n Cummings disappeared June 4. His charred remains were found June 16, buried on a 50-acre ranch near San Antonio owned by Mangum's 90-year-old grandfather.\n \n Brazoria County District Attorney Jeri Yenne would not comment on the case, citing a gag order issued by a judge Saturday afternoon.\n \n The Chronicle was unable to reach Mangum's attorney, Perry Stevens.\n \n Mangum - who claimed he has studied the Bible for \"thousands and thousands and thousands of hours\" - said God first commanded him to kill during a \"visitation,\" or dream, while he was in prison in 2001. He said his victim must be a man because men \"carry the harvest of the sinner.\"\n \n After six months' planning, Mangum said, he went to E.J.'s, a Montrose-area club, where he met Cummings. After they drank a couple of beers, he said, the two went to Cummings' home in Pearland.\n \n Mangum said he stabbed Cummings with a \"6-inch blade.\"\n \n \"It's not that I'm a bad dude,\" he said, expressing concern that people might view him as \"strange.\" Pausing briefly, he said, \"I love God.\"\n \n When police searched Cummings' home, they found traces of blood that someone had tried to clean up, as well as evidence that a struggle had taken place, according to court documents.\n \n Mangum became a suspect not long after Cummings disappeared, for reasons officials have declined to disclose.\n \n Tim Miller, executive director of Texas Equusearch, which found Cummings' remains, said last month that Mangum had used Cummings' credit cards to buy lighter fluid, a flashlight and hydrogen peroxide while he was en route to dispose of the body outside San Antonio.\n \n When credit card records showed that the cards had been used near San Antonio, investigators ran a property-records search that led them to the ranch owned by a Robert Mangum, Miller said.\n \n Store video also showed that the person using the cards appeared to be Terry Mangum, investigators have said.\n \n Cummings' remains were soon found in a shallow grave.\n \n The Facts, the daily newspaper in Brazoria County, has reported that Mangum told investigators he did not kill Cummings. Mangum first said he killed Cummings, during a jailhouse interview Friday with that paper.\n \n He is being held on $500,000 bail.\n",

None of his female friends had the same pleasure of my attention! So, did a 5 or 6 year old choose to be gay? No. I was already that way. \n \n I'm happy you have no problem with gays. But many gays, having been so damaged by christ-psychotic upbrining, have to find a new relationship with \"god\". So, the contradictions come from accepting how we were born and deciphering the bible (which I have totally thrown out the window, personally). Most christer's, especially the ones on this forum, are cafeteria christer's... picking and choosing the passages that suits their chosen beliefs. But people like Ghandi, Tich nat hahn, Dali Lama, Soygal Rimpoche have been great teachers of spirituality for me. I know many atheists who I see as more spiritual and enlightened than many of the christer's I know. So many christer's just sound like used car salesman.\n \n But one has to wonder why they feel the need to be here and save our damned souls. Nothing like having a deity complex.",

   "I, too, am an atheist. But because there's such pervasive, often virulent religion-based hostility towards homosexuality--a subject about which there is a well-established, NON-negative scientific consensus--I've done quite a bit of on-line research on this hostility and its sources over the years, and have reached a number of conclusions (in random order):\n \n 1. Biblical \"condemnation\" of gays typicaly boils down to two passages in Leviticus, the Sodom and Gomorrah story, and maybe half a dozen passages in various NT books. The far more numerous condemnations referring to divorce, adultury, judging others, etc. are simply ignored.\n \n 2. All of these passages are always taken out of context (both historically and message-wise) by those who cite them against gays.\n \n 3. The Levitical passages are unequivocally anti-same-sexual relations between men (though historical context supplies a convincing reason for the condemnation).\n \n 4. However, those who cite the first Levitical passage (\"Thou shalt not lie with a man as a woman\") always back off from the second, which says we should be killed, instantly identifying themselves as \"cafeteria Christians.\" (If they were true literalists, they would insist that that admonition be followed as well, yes?)\n \n 5. Those who cite the Levitical passages in question ONLY adhere to those two laws themselves. NONE of the other Levitical instructions are obeyed by themselves, despite the passages that threaten grave punishments should any, ANY, of them not be obeyed. (Again, can you say\"Cafeteria Christians\"?)\n \n 6. The Sodom and Gomorrah story (despite coining the term \"Sodomite\") is thoroughly referenced in other scripture, NOT ONE of which describes Sodom's sins as being related to sexuality, which would make no sense anyhow since the original reference quite clearly states that ALL--repeat \"ALL\"-- the males of the city \"young and old\" turned out to rape the angels (male rape being a common disrepectful behavior in the day, quite unrelated to orientation--but we don't want to get into historical context, now do we?) If you take the literalists at their literal word, there were NO  straight men, young or old, in Sodom. Which logically infers -- beyond raising questions of how anyone could be born in such a city--that it was beyond being the West Hollywood or Castro of its time, which makes it passing strange, to say the least, that there is no other reference in the OT to such a uniquely sinful phenomenon.\n \n 7. The NT references (mostly from Paul, who was not alive when Jesus was and therefore has NO first hand knowledge of Christ's views on the subject) contain cryptic neologisms of his own devising (in place of common Greek terms for homosexuality that he could have availed himself of) that NO ONE today is in agreement of the meaning of. There is simply NO consensus about what those words -- the keywords in the passages -- mean. Some believe they refer to specific activities like temple prostitution, others think they refer to homosexuality in general; conservatively, then, no one school of thought is more legitimate than the other, therefore, logically, you believe the interpretation you CHOOSE to believe.\n \n 8. The word \"homosexuality\" did not appear in any translation of the Bible prior to 1946, and was not itself coined until the late 1800's.\n \n 9. There is no way that agrarian shepherds who lived 2000 years ago would have understood the concept of an innate sexual orientation, which we are only beginning now scientifically to comprehend.\n \n 8. Jesus doesn't mention anything about homosexuality in the NT, unless you want to broadly interpret the word \"eunuch,\" which he says is the way some people were BORN.\n \n 9. People who CHOOSE to believe in an anti-gay interpretation of Biblical verses invariably refuse to discuss the interpretation/contextual/translation differences on their actual merits, and instead will broadly dismiss those who take opposing views as \"non-mainstream,\" \"pro-gay,\" etc., etc.\n \n 10. People do not LEARN anti-gay attitudes from scripture. (Do you EVER hear someone say they regret being anti-gay, but they just learned that the Bible ordains they must? No. Never. Never ever.) If their pastor told them the Bible doesn't condemn homosexuality, do you for an instant think they'd go \"Whew! Thank God!\" NO! They'd change churches so fast your head would spin. They CHOOSE the Biblical interpretation that supports their pre-existing anti-gay prejudice. As they once did with their anti-black prejudice. As they once did with their anti-Semitic prejudice. As they once with their anti-women's-rights prejudice. Scriptures are, as they have ever been, a tabula rasa which any bigot can use to justify his un-Christlike attitude and actions towards whomever he CHOOSES to despise.",

Except that due to the advent of the Age of Grace, we are not living under the Law anymore, but under Grace. And you are confusing judgments under the Law with commandments under the Law which is why you place the same weight of the condemnation of homosexuality as an active sin with the commandment to punish the act. As we are in the Age of Grace, the death sentence isn't to be followed anymore while the act of homosexuality, just as the act of adultery are still sins in this Age. Even the Jewish people who deny the Messiah no longer exercise the Levitical Laws in their legal system. So how do you consider Christians to be of the cafeteria variety for not wanting to kill homosexuals as you give the Jews, who follow the OT exclusively a pass ? Kind of hypocritical isn't it ? Not to mention the fact that if you were right in the least bit, Jews would still be following the Laws in question.\n \n \n5. Those who cite the Levitical passages in question ONLY adhere to those two laws themselves. NONE of the other Levitical instructions are obeyed by themselves, despite the passages that threaten grave punishments should any, ANY, of them not be obeyed. (Again, can you say\"Cafeteria Christians\"?\n\n \n See answer above:\n \n \n6.

Which logically infers -- beyond raising questions of how anyone could be born in such a city--that it was beyond being the West Hollywood or Castro of its time, which makes it passing strange, to say the least, that there is no other reference in the OT to such a uniquely sinful phenomenon.\n\n \n Regarding the bolded, this isn't even close to true. I, and many theologians happen to firmly believe that the reason why Sodom and Gomorra were destroyed was precisely because straight people were practicing all types of sexual debauchery. Just as the original language in the bible clearly states. And specifically because they were Cities that received all types of Travelers, Tradesmen, Merchants and Business People. They could almost be compared to the Ancient version of Vegas which is a big Conference and Party Town.\n \n This isn't to say that they didn't also have a large population of homosexuals too but I believe God wiped out those cities mainly because it was a thorough fare for straight people who passed through those cities and practiced all kinds of sexual perversions before returning to where ever they lived. Here is my supporting verse.\n Jude 1:7:\n \n The King James Version of the Bible translates verse 7 as:\n \n Jude 1:7: \"Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.\" \n \n The phrase translated as \"strange flesh\" in the original Greek reads: \"sarkos heteras.\" Ironically, our English word \"heterosexual\" is derived from \"heteras.\" \"Strange flesh\" has been variously translated in other versions as \"perverted sensuality,\" \"unnatural lust,\" \"unnatural sex,\" \"lust of men for other men,\" \"pursued unnatural desire,\" \"sexual sin, even perversion,\" and (in the NIV) \"perversion.\"\n \n7. The NT references (mostly from Paul, who was not alive when Jesus was and therefore has NO first hand knowledge of Christ's views on the subject) contain cryptic neologisms of his own devising (in place of common Greek terms for homosexuality that he could have availed himself of) that NO ONE today is in agreement of the meaning of. There is simply NO consensus about what those words -- the keywords in the passages -- mean. Some believe they refer to specific activities like temple prostitution, others think they refer to homosexuality in general; conservatively, then, no one school of thought is more legitimate than the other, therefore, logically, you believe the interpretation you CHOOSE to believe.\n \n\n \n As to your first claim that Paul didn't live at the same time as Christ, you are wrong again. He was born in the year 10 so was 10 years younger than Jesus. Or approximately 23 when jesus was crucified.\n Biography of the Apostle Paul\n \n The beginnings of Paul are an interesting jumble, and they highlight the cosmopolitan world that was the Roman Empire. He was born in an Asian city now located on the southern coast of Turkey called Tarsus in about the year 10. His parents were Jewish, presumably strict Pharisees. They were also Roman citizens.\n \n At the age of fourteen Paul was sent to Jerusalem to train to be a Rabbi. His teacher was a prominent man named Gamaliel. Rabbis, at the time, were also taught another trade. The idea was to keep teachers from becoming a burden on society. They also wanted to have something to fall back on during hard times. Paul was trained to be a tent-maker.\n So from 14 on Paul was a student under the greatest Pharisee of his generation. He also lived and studied in jerusalem so was most likely present through out Jesus entire ministry in and around Galilee. So as a serious student of the Torah, and also of this new sect he would go on to first attempt to destroy, and then to lead, it is reasonable to assume that Paul had an intimate knowledge of Jesus ministry, miracles and teachings.\n \n In addition to the above, Jesus gave some very clear direction regarding marriage which speaks to the homosexual issue by implication. If homosexuality were an acceptable practice then He wouldn't have quoted Genesis and reiterated Gods original reason for creating us Male and Female. and I quote: Matthew 19:5 and He said, 'For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and will be united with his wife, and the two will become one flesh'? 1 \n \n In the above passage, Jesus was presented with a question by the Pharisees: Is divorce lawful? But instead of giving a simple yes or no, he referred to Genesis and, more specifically, to created intent as the standard by which to judge sexual matters. By repeating the Genesis account, he emphasizes four elements of the created intent for marriage and sexual relating. Independence was one - a man was to leave his own home to establish his own family with his wife; a \"one flesh\" sexual union was another; and, of course, monogamy. But the first element of created intent Jesus stressed was the complimentary factor: it was to be a union of male and female, man and wife.\n \n Now granted, homosexuality may not have been mentioned by Jesus - we might as well add here that a lot of other sexual variations weren't, either. But he couldn't have spelled out the standard for sexual expression more clearly: male to female, joined as God intended them to be. The gay church cannot so easily assume he would have approved of anything less.",

As someone who has also studied the matter in-depth as well, I'd like to make some general comments on these points.\n \n \n1. Biblical \"condemnation\" of gays typicaly boils down to two passages in Leviticus, the Sodom and Gomorrah story, and maybe half a dozen passages in various NT books. The far more numerous condemnations referring to divorce, adultury, judging others, etc. are simply ignored.\n\n \n While it is true that these passages are mostly what is used in terms of the gay sex issue, it is certainly not so that other condemnations such as adultery and divorce are ignored. Many Christians do take a strong and hard stance on the issues of adultery and divorce. You just don't hear about it as much because that's not what tends to make the news these days. If a prominent evangelical leader makes a public statement that adultery is bad, it's just not going to be newsworthy. If that same leader makes a statement that gay sex is bad, it's more likely to be newsworthy because that's a controversial matter in our society these days. Now, go to most any church and sooner or later you'll hear a sermon--maybe quite a few sermons--containing objections to things like adultery and divorce. In fact, I've heard many more sermons and seen many more writings by Christian authors on the issues of divorce and adultery than homosexuality. Even anti-gay Dobson has written much more about husband/wife relationships and avoiding divorce than he has directly about homosexuality.\n \n \n2. All of these passages are always taken out of context (both historically and message-wise) by those who cite them against gays.\n\n \n This, I believe, is a matter of opinion. If one is using the passages to rail against homosexuality as an innate nature, then yes, it's true. After all, no one understood or knew at that time that it was innate as being a part of one's biological nature. However, from the standpoint of gay sex--which is really what Christians are objecting to--it is not out of context. It makes no difference that the gay sex going on happened to be with temple prostitutes (if that's the context one happens to opine) because it's STILL gay sex--a man lying with a man as with a woman (meaning, sexual relations of course).\n \n \n3. The Levitical passages are unequivocally anti-same-sexual relations between men \n \n 4. However, those who cite the first Levitical passage (\"Thou shalt not lie with a man as a woman\") always back off from the second, which says we should be killed, instantly identifying themselves as \"cafeteria Christians.\" (If they were true literalists, they would insist that that admonition be followed as well, yes?)\n\n \n Well it would be pretty consistent actually for the Bible here to deal with only men and not women--this was pretty common. All over the Bible we find men being the focus of things. \n \n Now, regarding the issue of \"backing off from the second\"; there needs to be a distinction made here between moral admonitions concerning behavior and punishments. Note that it is the punishment part that is backed off from. This is because in Christianity, it is generally understood that what has changed is the punishment (and atoning by sacrifice) under the law, but not the admonitions against the forbidden behavior. There is a distinction here between the behavior and it's punishment. It's not a matter of being a literalist, but rather that it's wrong to kill gay people, and Christ Himself makes clear that it's wrong to do that to people. Doesn't mean however that they shouldn't still believe the previously punishable behavior is wrong in the eyes of God. Perhaps orthodox Jews would still believe such punishment is appropriate (as they do not hold to what Christ said), but not a Christian who's read the teachings of Christ. Note also that the same standard is generally held for things like adultery--most Christians would certainly say adultery is bad, but remember the OT also commands that an adulteress be killed. Well, Christians don't do that either. Doesn't mean they should accept that adultery is ok, though.\n \n \n6. The Sodom and Gomorrah story (despite coining the term \"Sodomite\") is thoroughly referenced in other scripture, NOT ONE of which describes Sodom's sins as being related to sexuality, which would make no sense anyhow since the original reference quite clearly states that ALL--repeat \"ALL\"-- the males of the city \"young and old\" turned out to rape the angels (male rape being a common disrepectful behavior in the day, quite unrelated to orientation--but we don't want to get into historical context, now do we?) If you take the literalists at their literal word, there were NO  straight men, young or old, in Sodom. Which logically infers -- beyond raising questions of how anyone could be born in such a city--that it was beyond being the West Hollywood or Castro of its time, which makes it passing strange, to say the least, that there is no other reference in the OT to such a uniquely sinful phenomenon.\n\n \n I agree with this concerning Sodom and Gomorrah, at least to the extent that the real sin there was inhospitality (for whatever reason). However, it's just as absurd that every person, young and old, in the whole city would be doing the same thing of ANY sin, inhospitality, gay sex, or whatever. So I'm not sure that point bears much weight beyond the fact the story is unusual. \n \n \n7. The NT references (mostly from Paul, who was not alive when Jesus was and therefore has NO first hand knowledge of Christ's views on the subject) contain cryptic neologisms of his own devising (in place of common Greek terms for homosexuality that he could have availed himself of) that NO ONE today is in agreement of the meaning of. There is simply NO consensus about what those words -- the keywords in the passages -- mean. Some believe they refer to specific activities like temple prostitution, others think they refer to homosexuality in general; conservatively, then, no one school of thought is more legitimate than the other, therefore, logically, you believe the interpretation you CHOOSE to believe.\n\n \n Yes, Paul is open to interpretation. As is the whole Bible. On many subjects. The standard interpretation of this matter that could go either way has almost always been that he's talking about homosexual relations, and let's face it--for a man who was a legalistic Jewish pharisee a couple of thousand years ago, it seems more likely that he would certainly take issue that such a thing would be ok in the eyes of God. Look at orthodox Judaism today (not exactly a paragon of tolerance toward gay sex), which doesn't read ANY english mistranslations--but rather original Hebrew (the same ones that Paul did) and you'll see someone basically holding to the same views and having read the same scriptures that Paul read a long, long time ago. \n \n \n8. The word \"homosexuality\" did not appear in any translation of the Bible prior to 1946, and was not itself coined until the late 1800's.\n \n 9. There is no way that agrarian shepherds who lived 2000 years ago would have understood the concept of an innate sexual orientation, which we are only beginning now scientifically to comprehend.\n\n \n But of course it's not the innateness of homosexuality that Christians object to in the first place. I mean, think about it--what preacher has ever preached saying \"it's a sin to have homosexuality be your sexual orientation\"? Heck, does anyone here really think all these anti-gay preachers really believe being gay is an orientation to begin with?? They're entirely focused on the sexual issue. One only needs to read the posts of AA here to see that. When it comes to religious objections over homosexuality it's rarely ever about the innateness of it. That can be put to rest. So the fact agrarian shepherds 2000 years ago didn't understand the innateness of sexual orientation doesn't really speak to anything here, as the issue for these modern day objectors isn't innateness either.\n \n \n8. Jesus doesn't mention anything about homosexuality in the NT, unless you want to broadly interpret the word \"eunuch,\" which he says is the way some people were BORN.\n \n 9. People who CHOOSE to believe in an anti-gay interpretation of Biblical verses invariably refuse to discuss the interpretation/contextual/translation differences on their actual merits, and instead will broadly dismiss those who take opposing views as \"non-mainstream,\" \"pro-gay,\" etc., etc.\n\n \n I myself hold to the anti-gay-sex interpretation of some of these verses, and I'm right here, discussing it. So obviously that statement isn't true in every case. And yes, Jesus never directly mentioned gay sex. He didn't mention many things that Christians also believe are wrong. He never, for instance, mentioned embezzlement. Does that hold any weight whatsoever in the idea that He would have approved of embezzlement? I doubt it.\n \n \n10. People do not LEARN anti-gay attitudes from scripture. (Do you EVER hear someone say they regret being anti-gay, but they just learned that the Bible ordains they must? No. Never. Never ever.) If their pastor told them the Bible doesn't condemn homosexuality, do you for an instant think they'd go \"Whew! Thank God!\" \n\n \n Well, let's be very careful here. There is real prejudice (which is bad) and then there is the widespread view that the Bible forbids gay sex. And yes, sometimes they overlap. Prejudice and anti-gay attitudes are bad. There is no question about that, and I don't think anyone here would disagree. However, why should we conflate two issues here? Whether or not the Bible condemns gay sex should be a fact-based issue and debate independent and regardless of peoples' anti-gay prejudices (which they shouldn't have even IF the Bible doesn't approve of gay sex). \n \n There is simply no way someone can honestly come away from these thousands-of-years-old legalistic texts with the conclusion it doesn't forbid gay sexual relations.

   "This, I believe, is a matter of opinion. If one is using the passages to rail against homosexuality as an innate nature, then yes, it's true. After all, no one understood or knew at that time that it was innate as being a part of one's biological nature. However, from the standpoint of gay sex--which is really what Christians are objecting to--it is not out of context. It makes no difference that the gay sex going on happened to be with temple prostitutes (if that's the context one happens to opine) because it's STILL gay sex--a man lying with a man as with a woman (meaning, sexual relations of course).\n\n \n No, being gay is not the same as being a temple prostitute, jyoshu. These are two completely different ways of being and actions. A man lying with a man is not gay sex, it is a man lying with a man. The men need not be homosexual nor physically demonstrating gay sex. They are being temple prostitutes, not being gay. If it were a man and a woman doing temple prostitution you would not point to that and say \"ah ha! That is a generalizable representation of all heterosexual actions and thus condemns all heterosexual actions!\" Prostitution is not anyone's sexual orientation in action. They are doing it for money, or to please a god which will give them good crops or many strong children. \n \n \nNow, regarding the issue of \"backing off from the second\"; there needs to be a distinction made here between moral admonitions concerning behavior and punishments. Note that it is the punishment part that is backed off from. This is because in Christianity, it is generally understood that what has changed is the punishment (and atoning by sacrifice) under the law, but not the admonitions against the forbidden behavior. There is a distinction here between the behavior and it's punishment. It's not a matter of being a literalist, but rather that it's wrong to kill gay people, and Christ Himself makes clear that it's wrong to do that to people. Doesn't mean however that they shouldn't still believe the previously punishable behavior is wrong in the eyes of God. Perhaps orthodox Jews would still believe such punishment is appropriate (as they do not hold to what Christ said), but not a Christian who's read the teachings of Christ. Note also that the same standard is generally held for things like adultery--most Christians would certainly say adultery is bad, but remember the OT also commands that an adulteress be killed. Well, Christians don't do that either. Doesn't mean they should accept that adultery is ok, though.\n\n \n So is it still wrong to wear clothing of two different fabrics, or to plant two different crops in the same field, and what are we going to do about that?\n \n \nYes, Paul is open to interpretation. As is the whole Bible. On many subjects. The standard interpretation of this matter that could go either way has almost always been that he's talking about homosexual relations, and let's face it--for a man who was a legalistic Jewish pharisee a couple of thousand years ago, it seems more likely that he would certainly take issue that such a thing would be ok in the eyes of God. Look at orthodox Judaism today (not exactly a paragon of tolerance toward gay sex), which doesn't read ANY english mistranslations--but rather original Hebrew (the same ones that Paul did) and you'll see someone basically holding to the same views and having read the same scriptures that Paul read a long, long time ago.\n\n \n Prove that's what he was saying. The fact that he was part of a culture isn't proof. He may have condemned certain acts which involved people of the same sex, such as the sex slave trade, but those acts are not generally representative of the way gay people act and live.\n \n \nBut of course it's not the innateness of homosexuality that Christians object to in the first place. I mean, think about it--what preacher has ever preached saying \"it's a sin to have homosexuality be your sexual orientation\"? Heck, does anyone here really think all these anti-gay preachers really believe being gay is an orientation to begin with?? They're entirely focused on the sexual issue. One only needs to read the posts of AA here to see that. When it comes to religious objections over homosexuality it's rarely ever about the innateness of it. That can be put to rest. So the fact agrarian shepherds 2000 years ago didn't understand the innateness of sexual orientation doesn't really speak to anything here, as the issue for these modern day objectors isn't innateness either.\n\n \n So they simply think it's their business what goes on in people's beds? There's nothing more to it than that?\n \n \nI myself hold to the anti-gay-sex interpretation of some of these verses, and I'm right here, discussing it. So obviously that statement isn't true in every case. And yes, Jesus never directly mentioned gay sex. He didn't mention many things that Christians also believe are wrong. He never, for instance, mentioned embezzlement. Does that hold any weight whatsoever in the idea that He would have approved of embezzlement? I doubt it.\n\n \n Well, embezzlement may fit in with the idea that stealing is wrong. He didn't mention Constitutional Democracy or that slaves should be freed, or that women should be in positions of authority, so are those things wrong?\n \n \nWell, let's be very careful here. There is real prejudice (which is bad) and then there is the widespread view that the Bible forbids gay sex. And yes, sometimes they overlap. Prejudice and anti-gay attitudes are bad. There is no question about that, and I don't think anyone here would disagree. However, why should we conflate two issues here? Whether or not the Bible condemns gay sex should be a fact-based issue and debate independent and regardless of peoples' anti-gay prejudices (which they shouldn't have even IF the Bible doesn't approve of gay sex).\n\n \n That's an anti-gay prejudice, objecting to gay sex. It's not sex that you are objecting to, you're objecting to the fact it's gay. Being gay is ok, as long as you repress your sexuality deep inside, is what you are saying. It's ok to be gay, just not to BE REALLY GAY. \n \n \nThere is simply no way someone can honestly come away from these thousands-of-years-old legalistic texts with the conclusion it doesn't forbid gay sexual relations. It says what it says, quite clearly.\n\n \n No, it doesn't. Nowhere do I see gay sexual relations being mentioned. The depictions in the Bible are not the way myself nor any of the gay people I know, live in being who we are.",

   "I guess you missed my response to you LA, or did you choose to ignore it ?\n \n \n4. However, those who cite the first Levitical passage (\"Thou shalt not lie with a man as a woman\") always back off from the second, which says we should be killed, instantly identifying themselves as \"cafeteria Christians.\" (If they were true literalists, they would insist that that admonition be followed as well, yes?)\n\n \n Then as a literalist we should also kill all adulterers too, right ? Except that due to the advent of the Age of Grace, we are not living under the Law anymore, but under Grace. And you are confusing judgments under the Law with commandments under the Law which is why you place the same weight of the condemnation of homosexuality as an active sin with the commandment to punish the act. As we are in the Age of Grace, the death sentence isn't to be followed anymore while the act of homosexuality, just as the act of adultery are still sins in this Age. Even the Jewish people who deny the Messiah no longer exercise the Levitical Laws in their legal system. So how do you consider Christians to be of the cafeteria variety for not wanting to kill homosexuals as you give the Jews, who follow the OT exclusively a pass ? Kind of hypocritical isn't it ? Not to mention the fact that if you were right in the least bit, Jews would still be following the Laws in question.\n \n \n5. Those who cite the Levitical passages in question ONLY adhere to those two laws themselves. NONE of the other Levitical instructions are obeyed by themselves, despite the passages that threaten grave punishments should any, ANY, of them not be obeyed. (Again, can you say\"Cafeteria Christians\"?\n\n \n See answer above:\n \n \n6. The Sodom and Gomorrah story (despite coining the term \"Sodomite\") is thoroughly referenced in other scripture, NOT ONE of which describes Sodom's sins as being related to sexuality, which would make no sense anyhow since the original reference quite clearly states that ALL--repeat \"ALL\"-- the males of the city \"young and old\" turned out to rape the angels (male rape being a common disrepectful behavior in the day, quite unrelated to orientation--but we don't want to get into historical context, now do we?) If you take the literalists at their literal word, there were NO straight men, young or old, in Sodom. Which logically infers -- beyond raising questions of how anyone could be born in such a city--that it was beyond being the West Hollywood or Castro of its time, which makes it passing strange, to say the least, that there is no other reference in the OT to such a uniquely sinful phenomenon.\n\n \n Regarding the bolded, this isn't even close to true. I, and many theologians happen to firmly believe that the reason why Sodom and Gomorra were destroyed was precisely because straight people were practicing all types of sexual debauchery. Just as the original language in the bible clearly states. And specifically because they were Cities that received all types of Travelers, Tradesmen, Merchants and Business People. They could almost be compared to the Ancient version of Vegas which is a big Conference and Party Town.\n \n This isn't to say that they didn't also have a large population of homosexuals too but I believe God wiped out those cities mainly because it was a thorough fare for straight people who passed through those cities and practiced all kinds of sexual perversions before returning to where ever they lived. Here is my supporting verse.\n Jude 1:7:\n \n The King James Version of the Bible translates verse 7 as:\n \n Jude 1:7: \"Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.\" \n \n The phrase translated as \"strange flesh\" in the original Greek reads: \"sarkos heteras.\" Ironically, our English word \"heterosexual\" is derived from \"heteras.\" \"Strange flesh\" has been variously translated in other versions as \"perverted sensuality,\" \"unnatural lust,\" \"unnatural sex,\" \"lust of men for other men,\" \"pursued unnatural desire,\" \"sexual sin, even perversion,\" and (in the NIV) \"perversion.\"\n \n7. The NT references (mostly from Paul, who was not alive when Jesus was and therefore has NO first hand knowledge of Christ's views on the subject) contain cryptic neologisms of his own devising (in place of common Greek terms for homosexuality that he could have availed himself of) that NO ONE today is in agreement of the meaning of. There is simply NO consensus about what those words -- the keywords in the passages -- mean. Some believe they refer to specific activities like temple prostitution, others think they refer to homosexuality in general; conservatively, then, no one school of thought is more legitimate than the other, therefore, logically, you believe the interpretation you CHOOSE to believe.\n \n\n \n As to your first claim that Paul didn't live at the same time as Christ, you are wrong again. He was born in the year 10 so was 10 years younger than Jesus. Or approximately 23 when jesus was crucified.\n Biography of the Apostle Paul\n \n The beginnings of Paul are an interesting jumble, and they highlight the cosmopolitan world that was the Roman Empire. He was born in an Asian city now located on the southern coast of Turkey called Tarsus in about the year 10. His parents were Jewish, presumably strict Pharisees. They were also Roman citizens.\n \n At the age of fourteen Paul was sent to Jerusalem to train to be a Rabbi. His teacher was a prominent man named Gamaliel. Rabbis, at the time, were also taught another trade. The idea was to keep teachers from becoming a burden on society. They also wanted to have something to fall back on during hard times. Paul was trained to be a tent-maker.\n So from 14 on Paul was a student under the greatest Pharisee of his generation. He also lived and studied in jerusalem so was most likely present through out Jesus entire ministry in and around Galilee. So as a serious student of the Torah, and also of this new sect he would go on to first attempt to destroy, and then to lead, it is reasonable to assume that Paul had an intimate knowledge of Jesus ministry, miracles and teachings.\n \n In addition to the above, Jesus gave some very clear direction regarding marriage which speaks to the homosexual issue by implication. If homosexuality were an acceptable practice then He wouldn't have quoted Genesis and reiterated Gods original reason for creating us Male and Female. and I quote: Matthew 19:5 and He said, 'For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and will be united with his wife, and the two will become one flesh'? 1 \n \n In the above passage, Jesus was presented with a question by the Pharisees: Is divorce lawful? But instead of giving a simple yes or no, he referred to Genesis and, more specifically, to created intent as the standard by which to judge sexual matters. By repeating the Genesis account, he emphasizes four elements of the created intent for marriage and sexual relating. Independence was one - a man was to leave his own home to establish his own family with his wife; a \"one flesh\" sexual union was another; and, of course, monogamy. But the first element of created intent Jesus stressed was the complimentary factor: it was to be a union of male and female, man and wife.\n \n Now granted, homosexuality may not have been mentioned by Jesus - we might as well add here that a lot of other sexual variations weren't, either. But he couldn't have spelled out the standard for sexual expression more clearly: male to female, joined as God intended them to be. The gay church cannot so easily assume he would have approved of anything less.",

   "LDS Church leaders have posted a new pamphlet on their Web site this week, answering questions often raised by church members regarding same-sex attraction and how to deal with it.\n The new resource, which is being announced through a letter to LDS bishops and stake presidents, seeks to assure troubled church members of God's love despite challenges and questions, \"including some related to same-gender attractions, (that) must await a future answer, even in the next life.\"\n It does not touch on scientific theories about homosexuality or its origins but addresses how to deal with it from a spiritual perspective. The text uses the term \"same-gender attraction\" rather than \"gay\" or \"homosexual\" to distinguish between a lifestyle choice and an attraction only.\n The new document re-emphasizes the difference between attraction and behavior, citing the importance of faith in God, self-control and obedience to the church's law of chastity for members. \"The desire for physical gratification does not authorize immorality by anyone,\" it states.\n \"True happiness depends on more than the expression of physical urges. These urges diminish as more fundamental emotional needs are met - such as the need to interact with and serve others,\" it says. \"True happiness comes from self-control, self-respect and positive direction in life,\" as well as a \"testimony of true doctrine.\"\n It urges those who have felt rejected by fellow church members to \"show love and kindness to others\" in order to help change attitudes and \"follow Christ more fully. No member of the church should ever be intolerant.\"\n At the same time, \"it is not helpful to flaunt homosexual tendencies or make them the subject of unnecessary observation or discussion,\" the document says. \"It is better to choose as friends those who do not publicly display their homosexual feelings. The careful selection of friends and mentors who lead constructive, righteous lives is one of the most important steps to being productive and virtuous.\"\n \n http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,695195383,00.html",

   "That may be your perceptions, but the weight of their arguments has to do with same-gender sexual relations. Not innateness. They don't care that you're gay. And FWIW, the context we have been in, specifically here, is the moralism of same-gender sex, not marriage. That's a whole new issue in this discussion. But I can certainly see why you'd want to change the subject at this point. emoticon_xangel\n\n \n The fact that they oppose rights for gay PEOPLE, when it is not directly related to sexual actions, proves my point that it is not only about actions for them.\n \n \nConsidering that the sexual practice would include whatever happens when a man lies with a man, I'd say that's pretty darn inclusive of lots of various practices. It's interesting that you're so out to split hairs on this subject. In doing so you're inadvertently being more the letter-of-the-law legalist here than those who oppose you, even though their legalism is what you disagree with them on.\n\n \n It's ridiculous to not put thing into context. When Paul was saying women were to be silent, not teach and have no authority over a man, he was talking about decorum in the church setting. He did not mean women should at all times, in all contexts, be silent. Anyone can take a few words out and not consider their context. This was related to the worship of a pagan fertility God, temple prostitution when it says a man should not lie with a man as with a woman. It's not an accurate description of homosexuality at all. It makes no sense that way but makes sense when describing temple prostitution. It's outrageous to think that it meant gay men should never, under any circumstance have sex, in accordance with our sexuality, our most basic sexual natures.\n \n \nI'm sure you could find some way to twist it into something else, and run every single writing of a church father on this through the anything-but-sex interpretive filter. Sort of like using a \"NOT\" in a boolean search. At some point it's gets more ridiculous than the very idea they opposed it to begin with (which of course makes a lot more sense given the pre-enlightenment time of history and so forth than arguing they had no problem with it). It's like someone showing you a section of Shakespeare where he puts sexual references in his play (which were often innuendos or indirect references) and insisting, against most scholarship out there, that 'it's not REALLY what he meant. He meant something else.'\n\n \n Perhaps it is you who has some ridiculously narrow-minded ideas about gay sex, and what it means to live being gay. I don't see why re-interpretation couldn't happen with Shakespeare as with the Bible.\n \n \nThat may be true, but people are free to have opinions, and you don't get to be the thought-police. People can have whatever opinions of your behavior they want. That's life; deal with it.\n\n \n What an argument! I've never heard that one before, \"it's my opinion\". Yes, so what?",

Who already had strong rules against gay lovin' (and all other types of prohibited lovin') so it wasn't necessary for Him to repeat what was commonly known and practiced.\n However, Paul pushed on the the Gentiles. Who in many cases were known to have converted from faiths that engaged in that gay lovin'.\n Thus, he had to brush up the old time religious prohibitions that God imposed for them.\n \n Think of it like this, I'm a coach who's training a team that has years of experience, do I teach them the basics or merely gloss over it as I seek to spend my time of something else?\n Now compare me to a coach training newbies.\n I have to point out nearly everything to you. Including the fundamentals of the sport and how it's even played.\n \n Thus, Jesus of the Jews vs Paul of the Gentiles.\n \n \n If you recall how Jesus dealt with the prostitute. Did he do what he did because adultery was wrong or did he do it because it was a hypocracy? The man not being punished for the same crime...those present also guilty of crimes themselves.\n I'm sure J.C. had little problems with people getting whacked. He simply didn't like the hypocracy.\n Now, get out your little books and look up how often hypocracy is talked about...",
