   "1-1-1 A Tao, Sex, Machine-by Cauchy3\n \n Impersonations of spirits with elements for justices need to have first decedent of unalterable principles. A mater of course there is no death and would be no birth..\n \n Wombs are not very good to penis. Or honeys are not very good for rums.\n \n Clove pinks and open robes are soft. Pull your selves down to amuse her loves.\n \n Magnificence of ceremonies is on blows of histories and times. Thou should you on stages. Thou should you are Gods. If times are on infinite powers to powers of infinites then all might decease.\n \n Impersonations of spirits with elements for justices need to first have decedents of unalterable principles on earth. \n \n The true principle is to eat meals of animals except for vegetarians. But if all matters have spirits besides energies or.... On some other phrases of our Tai Chi and Tao! Gods are subsist on a space full of plants but with feeling and senor.. Then gods had been the tops. \n \n Powers, fames and private belongings involving all real at states are very important statistics for politics. The course to strive will mentally and physically spend a lot.\n \n Will the Tao exhausted? Ethics or justices are all spent away. There are the rights to hunt fox. There are the rights to eat animal s fleshes.\n \n At least monks eat vegetables. At least there are creepers go down opened lakes. There are slave plants.\n \n Tao will turn over and spirits are hips that twisted up. Belles take off her robes. June of Arch takes out her dreams. Jesus change waters to wines but does he crushed grapes by spirits.\n \n His feet are on waters. Sea is so powerful. Priests give waters and keep the wines. \n \n Actually our so named Gods as many are mistresses with crotch-less dragnets or masters with long sharp shafts and beams. We may also have Comus. Gi! Do you have thoughts about a egg headed god in over superior spaces or dimensions.\n \n All is super-realism. All are double solos or ensembles. Multilateral treaties or multilateral trades or multilateral births and deaths of Gods in multilateral spaces with alterable principles are myths.\n \n Bloods are in stoups. Long opaque glasses of red wines or ruby glasses are windows to open and close.\n \n Or on a short edge our spaces and times are counts in fixed infinites. So all will disappear on once and for so long! Do you have some other alternatives?\n \n Whistle to my heads. How about the absolute pleasures of Goddesses? Why there is an apple for sadomasochism. If it true that not all bloods are curses. \n \n Charges me or tie my spirits on ropes and teach me. You may give me millions U.S dollars for a year of sexual slavery or for my fidelities.\n \n Playful submissiveness is blinded folds to our five senses for all knowledge of Gods. Gods are good feathers teasers. Oh do I have a mighty hand or hands with jelly fingers. \n \n The final good issues are to play toys games to machines. We use toys against machines. Do all our times are machine cycles of Gods. Gods are just other machines.\n \n --------Cheung Shun Sang=Cauchy3--------",
