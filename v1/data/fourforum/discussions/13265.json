   "8/04 Brady Campaign: White Lies And Damn Lies\n \n \nGun Control: The Brady Campaign, White Lies, And Damn Lies \n by\n Howard Nemerov \n When I began reconsidering my position on gun control, I needed to proceed in a structured manner. Being a medical researcher by profession, I knew how to construct reasonable testing guidelines in order to arrive at a supportable conclusion. Having determined that confiscation of civilian firearms in the United Kingdom and Australia had created no clear benefit, and that crime rates climbed significantly since the bans went into effect, I concluded that gun control was not working as advertised. \n \n I concluded that the claims of pro-gun-rights organizations were easily and consistently verifiable using neutral or even slightly anti-gun sources. But there was another side to the research, and that was to check the veracity of the claims of gun-control organizations. Were they telling the truth when they promoted the benefits of civilian disarmament? Were their claims based on statistically valid and verifiable sources? If they were not telling the truth about the benefits of gun control, could I trust their stated goals, or had they something more sinister in mind? \n \n The \"Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence\" is considered to be one of the preeminent gun control organizations in our country. It has a page addressing Australia since the 1997 gun ban called \"The Truth About Australia.\" 1 So members have already set themselves up as the arbiters of truth, putting their reputation on the line. We will examine four of their main points:\n",
