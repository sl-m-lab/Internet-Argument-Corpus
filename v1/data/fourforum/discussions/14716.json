   "So the preliminary recommendations are out from the deficit-reduction commission. You can find them below: \n \n http://www.fiscalcommission.gov/sites/fiscalcommission.gov/files/documents/CoChair_Draft.pdf\n \n Undoubtedly it will be me and maybe Daewoo responding in this thread since the so called \"tea partiers\" have seemingly already lost interest in reducing the deficit since their team won the House back. \n \n Nevertheless, below are some of the major proposals:\n [*]Reduce discretionary expenditures by $200 billion a year from the Pentagon and other federal agencies[*]Tax reform, change code and base rates[*]Cost-cutting in Medicare including the Doc Fix[*]Reduced farm subsidies and lower benefits for civil and military retirement[*]Social security reform - phase in higher maximum taxable earnings, lower replacement rates at higher incomes, and higher retirement ages; add in protections for low-income workers and a hardship exemption at age 62\n Some of the keys issues are:[*]Eliminate the AMT[*]1% cut in discretionary spending each year for three years and requirements to index to inflation after that[*]Change to biennial budgeting (<-- win!)[*]Tax code would be three rates and one corporate rate[*]Basically take away all deductions[*]Increase gas tax[*]pay doctors less on medicare[*]Reform civil service pension plan[*]reform student loans (hell yeah)[*]decrease ss benefits for upper wealth folks[*]increase age to 68-69[*]increase taxable maximum\n Frankly, not a bad start in my book. The fact that everyone hates it is also a good sign that we are on the right track. \n \n The improves I would make would be to cut each departments budget by 10,15,20% in the first year and 5,10,15% in the 2 year to follow and re-evaluate after that. I have no doubt each department and easily absorb that. I'd also try do a payout to employees who have 20+ years of service and are over 55 years of age. It is time to get their bloated salary out of government. After you clear those folks out reduce the pay bands for all jobs to something comparable to the private sector. Sorry DC but your housing boom is over. \n \n Finally, change how we do federal grants. Student loans and grants are a joke and need to change or done away with. Perhaps have the states handle all those needs. Also, change federal research grants so we stop spending money on absolutely worthless research projects. It is sad when most colleges are going more towards a research university because it pays more than tuition and state appropriations. \n \n I've got a few more suggestions but I'd love to be shocked and have someone chime in with an intelligent response.",

It did not do much good. Enacting it at the federal level is not going to provide us with much savings, and they know it.

We saw that last year when washington did everything in their power to spare americans the consequences of their fiscal actions. We literally have GSAs whose mandate is to keep housing prices high.

At best it has made college less affordable. At worst it has convinced students that you will be fine with 40k in debt while becoming a music major.

We should be done by the end of the week!!!\n \n IT just really bums me out that there are not more people who are paying attention to this. Whining about gays in the military instead??? In 11 years we will not be able to afford to FIELD a military, so it wont matter. One of the things that really hit me was when the chair of Obamas deficit commission said \"You dont get to be the greatest country in the world if you are broke\". I think he has got something there!! \n \n It is not too late. People just need to let their elected representatives know that they view this as a priority and understand that there will be some pain. The alternative is literally to stand by and watch the nation fail, and that is some REAL pain.\n \n Even the folks who usually do their level best to keep the sheeple sleeping have lately been stepping out and trying to spread the message. Ben Bernanke, who I generally loathe, literally sat in front of congress and told them in a televised session that the first thing he does every morning is check to see if the US treasury market has crashed overnight, and that every morning he wonders \"is this the day that it all comes crashing down\". \n \n Being head of the federal reserve is kind of like being the CEO of a large company. 85-90% of your job is to blow sunshine up peoples backsides. Obviously if he is getting up in front of congress and saying that he expects the nation to implode any day now, he feels strongly that somebody should be paying attention and DOING something about it. \n \n Unfortunately when nobody did, HE decided to, and somehow decided that monetizing the debt, which has never, ever worked out well for any country in all of history, was a good thing to try.

   "Didn't say anything about the DHH, It's the Social Security Cuts That I think are stupid. Politicians, especially conservatives always go after Social Security. Regardless of what you think Social Security is NOT a welfare program. The Program is set up to pay for itself but fails to do so because the Government can't keep it's hands out of the till. They use the Program as a Bank to fund needless wars, and other useless programs that they can't pay for any other way. These proposed cuts will only help in the long term, in 2037 when the program is projected to run out of Money if things don't change. But that does very little to lower our Current debt and it's just In my opinion a Cowardly way to deal with the current problem.\n \n They should cut Military spending.. including getting us out of the current wars. We should close international Military bases and bring our people home. We should stop getting involved in every little international problem that arises. We should cut programs that are meaningless.. like NASA.. what is the real need for a space Program?.. are we planning on leaving this planet anytime soon?... There are hundreds of ways they could cut spending without affecting the lives of the 51 million Americans who are on Social Security. If they really want to turn this around they should let the Bush tax cuts expire and go back to the tax rates we were under Clinton. That would increase revenues and help get the country back on the right track.\n \n But these politicians won't tell you that, no they'll tell you no taxes and then stick it to you from behind by cutting programs that many of these people depend on.",

   "And the conservatives agree on everything but the tax increases and military cuts. Good grief!\n\n \n If only they would not spend so much time pleasing lobbyists they might be the party of choice. The only thing that saves them from being unwanted is liberals are in the other pocket.\n \n \nIt initially was. This is what Roosevelt said when it was passed: \"we have tried to frame a law which will give some measure of protection to the average citizen and to his family against the loss of a job and against poverty-ridden old age.\"\n\n \n Social Security no, unemployment insurance no, assistance to states for health and welfare programs yes Aid to dependent children yes. It started as a retirement program that only paid to the person who contributed. How is that welfare?\n \n \nThat's the way it is set up. The liberals didn't want to change that back when Bush was president (not that Bush had a great idea). \n\n \n Does it seem right that way?\n \n \nI haven't gotten one either.\n\n \n Something we have in common\n \n \nwe should cut military spending but don't pretend like that will solve our problems.
