But since the general case is that the host does indeed have the choice of whether or not to allow a switch, then beware if such offer is made. There's ample room for manipulation of the odds, and it all depends on the mood of the host and if he wants you to lose or win.

The others doubted it. So each of us (2) wrote a computer simulation that could run for millions of iterations. The results were always the same for both of our programs. Switching doors won 66.66% of the time. It doesn't matter whether the host is named Bob or Monty; it doesn't matter if the host offers the option to every contestant or not. This is not a question of all situations presented in this particular game show. Whatever options that do not confirm to the problem are irrelevant. The problem was stated quite specifically in the first place, in spite of the ability of some to understand the problem. Whatever various game show options are offered that do not fall within the specifics of this problem are irrelevant. The point is that in every case that meets the specified case, one is more likely to win by switching.",

   "It doesn't matter whether the host is named Bob or Monty; it doesn't matter if the host offers the option to every contestant or not.\nThe name of the host does not matter of course. However, the discretion of the host to offer the option is significant. Your computer simulation that ran millions of iterations was probably written with the condition that the option to switch exists in every repetition. In such case it's little wonder that 'switching doors won 66.66% of the time,' since that's the chance of winning after an empty door is opened and the offer to switch is accepted. The simulation program is neutral and exerts no manipulation as a live host would.\n \n \n \nThis is not a question of all situations presented in this particular game show. Whatever options that do not confirm to the problem are irrelevant.\nAgreed. It remains the host's discretion to offer the switch or not, but we will disregard all situations in which the host withholds the offer. We will consider only the situation in which an offer to switch is given. Bear in mind, however, there is no requirement that the host must always make an offer to switch.\n \n \n \nThe problem was stated quite specifically in the first place, in spite of the ability of some to understand the problem.\nI think you mean 'inability' to understand. Anyway, the problem was stated ambiguously, since the two-thirds chance of winning by switching is dependent on a condition that is assumed but not specified. Such uncertainty in meaning is the essence of ambiguity. In view of your comment noting the inability of some to understand the problem, it bears repeating that the problem, as stated, does not specifically require that the host must always make an offer to switch.\n \n \n \nWhatever various game show options are offered that do not fall within the specifics of this problem are irrelevant.\nYes, you mentioned this above. Again I agree that any game show situation that doesn't meet the specified criteria of this problem must be disregarded. By the way, did I mention that the problem does not specifically require that the host must always make an offer to switch?\n \n \n \nThe point is that in every case that meets the specified case, one is more likely to win by switching.\nNow comes the litmus test. You did state: \"It doesn't matter if the host offers the option to every contestant or not.\" Nor do the stated specifics require that the host must always offer the option to switch. Consistent with such ambiguity, there is ample room for manipulation by the host. For example it can be shown that in every case that meets the specified case, one can never win by switching, despite your contrary view that one is more likely to win by switching. Beware if you ever play this game under the specified conditions stated.\n \n \n Let's call the three doors left, middle, and right. The prize is behind the left door. 1) The contestant picks the left door. The host then opens an empty door. In accord with your reasoning, the contestant switches and loses. 2) The contestant picks the middle door. The host opens the middle door, using his discretion not to make an offer to switch, and the contestant loses. 3) The contestant picks the door on the right. Again the host does not offer an option to switch, so again the contestant loses.\n \n [We disregard the latter two losses as irrelevant, since they do not entail an offer to switch and therefore do not satisfy the specified conditions.]\n \n To sum up, as long as the host has discretion of whether to offer a switch, the results can be manipulated in either direction, depending on the mood of the host. In the extreme example illustrated, the results are quite adverse, since the contestant can never win by following your advice to switch whenever the option is offered. It does not matter which door holds the prize. If the contestant chooses the prize door initially, the host will always open an empty door and make an offer to switch. If the contestant chooses an empty door initially, the host does not offer a switch. No matter how many iterations of the specified problem one considers, the contestant can never win by switching. This example satisfies all conditions specifically stated in the original problem. Hence, the 'problem with the problem.'\n \n As generally understood, the problem is interesting in that most people are surprised to learn that after one door is opened, switching will improve the chance of winning. And that's where most people stop, after understanding why the winning odds increase from 50% to 67%. In the final analysis, however, the problem is impossible to solve through mathematical reasoning, since the wording is ambiguous and the mood of the host unknown.",

   "The given conditions were provided and quite specific.\nIt may be better after this if we agree to disagree. Academic papers from North America, Europe, and Asia say that the wording of the problem, as presented in message 1, is ambiguous. I acknowledged from the get-go that switching wins two-thirds of the time if additional assumptions are specified. That was never in dispute. I simply noted that the conditions in msg 1 are ambiguous and that the result you're trying to show-that switching will double your chance of winning-is dependent on conditions that were not specified. You insist that the 'given conditions' are sufficient and that no one should say the question can't be answered without more information to eliminate the ambiguities. That you don't yet admit to the question's ambiguity is likely due that you don't yet see it. In any event the fault is not mine. \n \n Since you think the host's optional discretion to make the offer of a switch is irrelevant to the question, let's assume then that the host must always open a door and provide the offer to switch. Even then, however, switching does not automatically confer an advantage, since there's the further ambiguity of whether or not the host knows what's behind each door. The extent of the host's knowledge was not a given condition. Why is that significant? Why because if the host doesn't know what's behind each door and simply opens a door at random to reveal a goat, then there is no advantage to switching. The probability of the prize being behind either of the two remaining doors is one-half, not two-thirds, so switching makes no difference.\n \n That's two ambiguities I've shown. Your solution requires both of these conditions-that the host must know what's behind each door, and that the host must always make the offer to switch. Yet neither condition was made explicit at the outset, as Kronus since acknowledged. Your approach to resolving these apparent ambiguities is to impose your own judgment on conditions never specified, while denying me the same prerogative. A more fair and productive approach would be to address the ambiguities directly-that is, clarify all of the unstated assumptions your result is dependent on-rather than insist the problem was sufficiently stated at the outset.\n \n You have written twice to say 'my reasoning is flawed.' I stated earlier that it wasn't my reasoning that uncovered the ambiguities. The problem is thoroughly addressed in original source work on the web. Thus far you have supported your opinion with only your word. No books, no urls, no references to scientific papers-nothing but your word. I submit that you would benefit to look at sources beyond yourself.\n \n Wikipedia's article is a springboard if you're not sure where to start.\n \n The 59-page analysis by Mueser and Granberg is good. Their paper entitled The Monty Hall Dilemma Revisited: Understanding the Interaction of Problem Definition and Decision Making was authored in 1999, though they credit Morgan, Chaganty, Dahiya, & Doviak (1991) as the first to provide a formal analysis showing that the answer normally given by those stating the puzzle relies on unstated assumptions. Morgan et al (1991) Let's make a deal: The player's dilemma is published in the academic quarterly \"The American Statistician\", though a subscription is required to access it.\n \n Burkholder is suggested for the least reliance on verbiage and the most on formal mathematics. His approach uses Bayes' Theorem to show that when the host knows what's behind the doors, switching doubles the chance of winning, but if the host doesn't know what's behind the doors, there is no reason to switch, since the chance of winning the prize is the same for each door, 1/2.\n \n \n \nThe question was about a very specific contest in a gameshow.\n \n The tree, not the forest\nI have read and considered your opinion.

There is one possibility of no tails, three possibilities of one tail, three possibilities of two tails and one possibility of three tails, giving a total of 8 possiblilities.\n\n Ok, but what if instead of flipping them 1,2,3 where could see each coin fall you just put them all in a cup, shook it up, and flipped it over. You couldn't tell if you had hth or thh or hht. All you would know is that you had one tail. Remember, we aren't talking probabilities here, we're just counting number of different cases. You wouldn't be able to look at the three coins and say, that's hht, all you could say is that it's 1 tail. If you discount order than 1 tail is just one case, not three.",

However, as the question is stated, the answer is 8. The convolution regarding inattention to order would suggest that the probability of getting no tails or all tails is the same as getting one tail or two tails...clearly incorrect.",
