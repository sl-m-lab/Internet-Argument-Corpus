   "Bush detractors are very selfish people. They have forgotten about the events of 9/11, 2001, when terrorists flew hijacked planes into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center, killing 3000 innocent civilians. They care nothing for the American and British troops on the ground in Afghanistan and Iraq. Congress threatens to cut off funds and thereby deny them the food, supplies and equipment they need to carry out their work. Kennedy, Kerry, Pelosi, Reid, Biden and Dodd care far less about the United States than they do the Democratic Party. All they want is to embarass Bush if they can and try to win back the White House. They are still trying to even up for the impeachment of Bill Clinton. Fact is, George Bush and Tony Blair have stood like two giants since 9/11. They have defended America and the U.K. from blood-thirsty savages who have no regard for human life, not even their own. An anonymous man at the Twin Towers challenged Bush to do \"whatever it takes,\" and Bush is doing just that. WMD is meaningless. So is \"fighting over there.\" What mattered after 9/11 was retaliation (not revenge). Bush had to kick the biggest Muslim butt, and Saddam Hussein had the biggest Muslim butt. Bush gave Saddam an ultimatum to step down. He refused and paid the consequences. Bush knew hard times were coming. He knew his actions were taken with future generations of Americans in mind. They are the ones who will write the history of the early 21st century. They are the ones who will appreciate Bush and that he did what had to be done to break the will of jihadists and religious fanatics worldwide who would destroy America. It is not over yet. It may be a long struggle. But America will triumph as she did in World War II and the Cold War. Decency, human rights, science and progress for all humanity must and will prevail.",

   "Bush detractors are very selfish people. They have forgotten about the events of 9/11, 2001, when terrorists flew hijacked planes into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center, killing 3000 innocent civilians.\nBush detractors are enormously upset upon finding out how many warnings Bush had about Osama bin Laden prior to September 11, 2001. Bush detractors are enormously upset that Bush took a five-week vacation right after learning of an imminent threat of an attack by Osama bin Laden.\n \n They care nothing for the American and British troops on the ground in Afghanistan and Iraq.\nBush detractors know that the tracking down terrorists and putting an end to their terrorism has absolutely nothing to do with invading and occupying Iraq.\n \n Congress threatens to cut off funds and thereby deny them the food, supplies and equipment they need to carry out their work.\nBush is threatening to cut off funding for our personnel in Afghanistan (where they are needed) and Iraq (where they are placed in the midst of a civil war, not a struggle against terrorism) with his veto.\n \n Kennedy, Kerry, Pelosi, Reid, Biden and Dodd care far less about the United States than they do the Democratic Party.\nKennedy, Kerry, Pelosi, Reid, Biden and Dodd are true American patriots. They are trying to undo Bush's destruction of the United States.\n \n All they want is to embarass Bush if they can and try to win back the White House.\nThe American people are sick of the people in the White House and would dearly love to see Bush impeached.\n \n They are still trying to even up for the impeachment of Bill Clinton.\nClinton's impeachment was an expensive and trumped up bit of stupid nonsense that wasted legislative time and taxpayer money to the tune of $80,000,000.00.\n \n Fact is, George Bush and Tony Blair have stood like two giants since 9/11.\nBush and Blair will be remembered as midgets, as fools.\n \n They have defended America and the U.K. from blood-thirsty savages who have no regard for human life, not even their own.\nAmerica's borders are undefended. America's internal militia has been sent off to foreign wars, leaving our nation open to all sorts of threats. Our infrastructure is almost destroyed by Bush's stupid policies.\n \n An anonymous man at the Twin Towers challenged Bush to do \"whatever it takes,\" and Bush is doing just that.\nTotally false. In other words, another lie of the Kool-Aid drinkers.\n \n WMD is meaningless.\nI guess so. There weren't any.\n \n So is \"fighting over there.\"\nNot when we have created a university for terrorists in Iraq. We have created even more terrorists with the ongoing occupation of Iraq-which accomplishes nothing for America but dumps billions and billions of our taxdollars into the coffers of military contractors.\n \n What mattered after 9/11 was retaliation (not revenge).\nRetaliation? Where is Osama bin Laden, then? Why haven't we successfully retaliated against Osama bin Laden? Why hasn't he paid for attacking us on September 11, 2001?\n \n Bush had to kick the biggest Muslim butt, and Saddam Hussein had the biggest Muslim butt.\nThe wrong Muslim butt. Only a blind idiot would believe that Saddam Hussein had anything to do with September 11, 2001. \n \n Remember Osama bin Laden? Oh, you drank the Kool-Aid. You don't remember.\n \n Bush gave Saddam an ultimatum to step down.\nProve it.\n \n He refused and paid the consequences.\nProve it.\n \n Bush knew hard times were coming.\nFor everyone but Bush. And his rich friends. The rest of us are having hard times because of Bush.\n \n He knew his actions were taken with future generations of Americans in mind.\nYeah, he knew that future generations and generations would be paying for his stupidity.\n \n They are the ones who will write the history of the early 21st century.\nAnd they will curse the name of Bush.\n \n They are the ones who will appreciate Bush and that he did what had to be done to break the will of jihadists and religious fanatics worldwide who would destroy America.\nBush will be cursed as a fool who left them a legacy of debt and dishonor.\n \n It is not over yet.\nNo, not until Bush is gone and the damage that he has done is repaired.\n \n It may be a long struggle.\nAbsolutely. It's going to take a lot of work to repair the damage that Bush has done.\n \n But America will triumph as she did in World War II and the Cold War.\nWe hope. If we can overcome the damage that Bush has done.\n \n Decency, human rights, science and progress for all humanity must and will prevail.\nYes, we hope that decency, human rights, science and progress for all humanity will survive the reign of King George.",
