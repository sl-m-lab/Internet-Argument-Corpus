If marriage is, as the christian right has stated, about children then I have some new licensing rules that need to be implemented.\n \n \n 1 If marriage is limited to a man and a women they need to submit proof of fertility to get a license.\n \n 2 they must have a child within a year for the liscense being grated or the license must be surrendered\n \n 3 there can not be any divorce the couple must remain together for the childs welfare.\n \n 4 once the children are grown or if the child dies then the liscense must be surrendered.\n \n 5 only breeding age men and women will be permitted licenses.\n \n 6 proof of consumation, by video or Affidavit of 3 Witnesess must be kept on file at the court house.\n \n 7 the liscense must be renewed, much as a driver liscense is, with tests of parental fitness every 2 years. If found unfit the license is surrendered along with the children.\n \n \n I could live with this my sense of equality would be sated since there would also be heterosexuals excluded from marriage.\n\n \n \n \n \nNO I mean every word of what I type. If they institute these rules I will back off gay claim to marriage and accept that marriage is about children.\n As long as they continue to let 70 and 80 year olds get married marriage is not about children and there is no reason to exclude gay people.\n \n I would also add one more lisencing rule\n \n 8 No one may have children with out a marriage lisence.\n",

In fact, the legal documentation of the marriage license can trace its ROOTS TO MISCEGENATION LAWS.\n \n They used it as a legal tool to prevent blacks from marrying whites, just as the marriage license is used as a legal tool to prevent gays from marrying today.\n \n The irony of it all is amazing...\n History DOES repeat itself...\n Just look at the history of the law Massachusetts is using to prevent out of state gay couples from marrying in their state...",

   "Why not? If that's what they want to do, why should they be discriminated against? You say you want equality, so why shouldn't EVERYONE get marriage benefits? Whether or not they tie the knot shouldn't matter, right? I think Steeeeve's point is that gay marriage opens a huge can of worms in society because it means marriage is no longer clearly defined--anyone that comes along wanting marriage benefits might as well have them if we're going to make the line transparent or make it able to be moved. This is why a lot of people view marriage as, by the nature of the institution, an opposite-sex thing. Gay marriage redefines marriage.\n\n \n There is a distinct difference between discrimination and unfair discrimination. We don't allow children to vote, or adults with uncontrolled seizures to drive. We often discriminate for the social good. When persons become disenfranchized from the opportunity to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, we called that unfair discrimination, and hopefully are enlightened enough to change laws to correct that.\n \n Marriage would be defined the same way it is now with only one single change, the gender of the spouses. It would be very clearly defined. It wouldn't apply to \"anyone\" who wants marriage benefits, but to couples who want to get married. There is no slippery slope. This would not lead to further expansion of marriage to that of roomates, or siblings, or farm animals. Because in addition to the rights of marriage, the responsibilities would be there. Roomies who are casual acquaintenances would not be willing to accept the commitment. No one gets harmed with same-sex marriage, so it is unlike incest or polygamy. The other slippery slope canards, bestiality, necrophilia, inanimate objects, etc. are too absurd to comment upon.\n \n The idea that if we change the definition of marriage to include same-sex couples, it would change the definition of marriage is a tautology and is tantamount to merely being against the idea.\n \n In any event, if opposite gender acquaintences choose to get married now, there is nothing to stop them. I know of a circumstance when a woman married a friend when she developed a chronic medical condition and needed the health insurance. I know of two cases of \"divorced\" couples who are no longer living together and are living as though they are divorced, including pursuing relationships, but do not finalize the divorce to keep health benefits for the mom and kids. Should we be scrutinizing married people to be certain they are not gaming the system?",

Maybe the single people can't either for various reasons--economic for instance. It doesn't matter--the point is it's unnecessary discrimination in BOTH cases.\n \n \nThere is NO comparing the *plights* of a heterosexual couple who wants MARRIAGE benefits while REFUSING to marry, and a homosexual couple who WANTS to marry and is REFUSED to have it allowed.\n\n \n I'm not comparing any \"plight\". This isn't about anyone suffering; this is about the fact that both are examples of unnecessary discrimination. If you want to start a separate discussion on how much gays are suffering a plight because they can't get couples' benefits, be my guest. You're trying to make an issue of degree here in terms of which has it worse off, and that's not even the point. It's irrelevant to the fact that both are unnecessary forms of discrimination. \n \n \nAnd yes. A black man who is forbidden to drink at a white only drinking fountain is just like a white man who can drink but doesn't want to drink at THAT fountain.\n Just out of curiousity, I have no problem repeating the analogy.\n Each time you try to dance around it, I enjoy saying it again because I know you can't address it.\n Do you think others don't notice that?\n\n \n You can use innacurate analogies all you want for all I care. The more proper analogy would be in cases of shorter waterfountains; what you're doing would be like short people wanting to re-make every waterfountain to be suitable for their height rather than putting a frickin' short fountain beside the tall one which is the sensible thing to do. You aren't just wanting a drink from the same fountain, you're trying to redefine the water fountain from the way it's normally made. So smoke on that analogy for awhile.\n \n \nNo. It's not.\n They CAN GET the benefits. They just don't make the EFFORT to GET the benefits.\n\n \n You can get benefits too as a gay person, just not the way you want to. They can get benefits too, just not a way they want to. From the standpoint simply being unnecessary discrimination, that's the bottom line--they're the same. The fact you think one is a worse degree of a problem than the other isn't the point.\n \n But hey, I understand how you feel--I don't like the idea of singles getting marriage benefits either. In fact, I think marriage benefits should stay to being what they're FOR: for MARRIED opposite-sex couples. At least I can admit that one is, for all practical purposes, no different than the other; yours is the inconsistent position. The point to all this is that whether you realize it or not, or want to admit it, what you're wanting to do is make marriage more open-ended.

You aren't just wanting a drink from the same fountain, you're trying to redefine the water fountain from the way it's normally made. So smoke on that analogy for awhile.\n\n This is something you have repeatedly FAILED to address.\n I'm going to bring it up again.\n There is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about the way that marriage is \"made\" that doesn't allow for gay marriage.\n There is no benefit given by straight marriage that isn't applicable for gay marriage.\n There is no purpose given by straight marriage that isn't applicable for gay marriage.\n \n It's not an issue of \"made\" for a purpose.\n It's an issue of somebody saying \"this marriage is just for straights\", and then you refuse to budge from that position.\n \n \n \nYou can get benefits too as a gay person, just not the way you want to.\n\n Man. You two keep arguing in circles, except I am the one CLOSING the circle, and you refuse to address the final arguments...\n Telling me that I can marry like a straight person does to get marriage is like saying that a Jewish person can have freedom of religion under a law preventing Judaism if he worships Jesus.\n There is no comparison in that and a man who complains about not having freedom of religion, just because he CHOOSES not to worship.\n \n \n \nFrom the standpoint simply being unnecessary discrimination, that's the bottom line--they're the same.\n\n No. They aren't.\n Another analogy.\n Would you tell a black man that he can \"legally\" marry a black woman, and that his complaints against miscegenation laws aren't real?\n And that his \"discrimination\" is like the discrimination of a white couple who DOES NOT WANT to marry?\n \n No matter how you look at it, it's inane.\n \n \n \nBut hey, I understand how you feel--I don't like the idea of singles getting marriage benefits either.\n\n Hold the phone there Jyoshu.\n I just plain DO NOT CARE if \"singles\" in a couple, who want couple benefits like marriage benefits, get those \"benefits\".\n I don't care.\n My point is that using this stupid \"I don't wanna, but I want the benefits anyways\" argument to try and ignore the unjustified discrimination against gay marriage is stupid. Stupid squared.\n There is no comparison between \"I don't wanna\" and \"I am legally forbidden from\"\n \n The straight couple CAN legally marry. Ergo, NO discrimination. There IS NO DISCRIMINATION against a couple who have the CAPACITY to enter into marriage, but then choose not to.\n The gay couple CANNOT legally marry. And furthermore, there is NO REASON for preventing them from marrying.\n \n What you two don't get is that this IS NOT just about the \"benefits\". The benefits provide a convincing argument, but if marriage had NO benefits, the state WOULD STILL have to afford gay couples the right of marriage.\n \n And maybe that's the solution to all this absurdity.\n Say that we hypothetically strip ALL benefits from marriage.

You keep trying to pretend that gay marriage doesn't open th can of worms here, but it does because you're really saying that marriage has to include other things.\n \n \nThere is no comparison between \"I don't wanna\" and \"I am legally forbidden from\"\n\n \n I told you, we could just as easily be dealing with the issue of someone who couldn't get the license for whatever reason. And as far as \"I don't wanna\" goes, from the state's perspective that's exactly what gays are saying by not marrying the state's way.\n \n \nWhat you two don't get is that this IS NOT just about the \"benefits\". The benefits provide a convincing argument, but if marriage had NO benefits, the state WOULD STILL have to afford gay couples the right of marriage.\n\n \n ????? emoticon_wow What the heck is the \"right of marriage\" from the state's perspective OTHER than the benefits? Tell us what else it is the state is providing!!! I'm dying to know, because as a married person, I must be missing out. It's not like anyone's preventing you from tying the knot to whoever you want, right now. I'd be married regardless of what the state does or doesn't do.",

   "Touche. Their tactics are really so tiresome and absurd - they remain argumentative to the end, throwing up any shred of a comment they can muster. I think they are now advocating everyone to be allowed to get all marriage benefits even if they have no desire to be married because they are concerned about being inclusive to all. OR are they advocating getting married willy-nilly to persons you don't even want to marry? And gays should be satisfied with marrying someone other than the person they want to commit to? But at the same time, same-sex marriage would be unthinkable. Quite silly, really.\n \n Do steve and jyosh really think they are making a logical argument? I don't know which is sadder, to be so deluded as to think being contrary is a debate, or they know they are being illogical, but say it anyway.\n \n You ask if they try this trick in real life. You are assuming they have one.\n\n \n It is more consistent than any other arguement you guys have made. \n \n So you have gays that want marriage benefits.

So argue that there should be a different line not that some people are \"discrimnating\" against you guys...as you wish to do the same.

If you want to fight for marriages to have a minimum-required time frame before divorce, go right ahead.

YOU keep talking about \"couples' benefits\".\n Let's cut through the XXXX.\n MARRIAGE is a right.\n The benefits associated with marriage ARE NOT a \"right\", persay...\n The state could decide to alter one of those benefits at any time. Remove one from the list. Add another. That's a state decision. The court wouldn't bat an eye.\n \n The only thing is that those benefits are ATTACHED to marriage, which is a right.\n \n Ergo, if you want to talk about giving non-married couples the \"benefits\", go for it. But it's not a \"rights\" issue.\n \n YOU want to focus on the benefits, and you're entitled to do that.\n But it IS a separate issue.\n \n \n \nThe point here is that it's YOUR logic, Foundit--it's the logic of the whole gay marriage proponent movement.\n\n And here we have a false-hood, ladies and gentlemen.\n What he is about to describe is not my \"logic\".\n My \"logic\" revolves around legitimate state interests and the RIGHT of marriage.\n \n \n \nYOU'RE the one wanting the state to start seeing other things than marriage to be marriage. Get it? You're wanting couples' benefits to go to things that the state doesn't view as marriage.\n\n This isn't my argument.\n This is your attempt to boil away the essential details from my argument, and then rephrase my argument so you can joust with a strawman.\n \n Marriage \"benefits\" are not a right. MARRIAGE ITSELF is a right. And as such, it is subject to the scrutiny of the 14th amendment.\n If you can show me any court ruling that says marriage BENEFITS THEMSELVES are a right, you could make progress in pretending you have an argument.\n \n Until then, you don't got squat.\n \n \n \nI told you, we could just as easily be dealing with the issue of someone who couldn't get the license for whatever reason. And as far as \"I don't wanna\" goes, from the state's perspective that's exactly what gays are saying by not marrying the state's way.\n\n No. It's not. And it's amazing you are keeping this XXXX up this long...\n \n What you are talking about is a HETEROSEXUAL COUPLE who wants a BENEFIT associated with marriage, but DOES NOT WANT to marry.\n What I am talking about is a HOMOSEXUAL COUPLE who wants to MARRY. Period.\n \n Marriage is a right.\n The benefits are ASSOCIATED with marriage, but they are not a right.\n \n \n \n????? emoticon_wow What the heck is the \"right of marriage\" from the state's perspective OTHER than the benefits?\n\n Double WoW!\n Do you get what \"marriage\" is? At all?\n The benefits are there to help the marriage.\n And now you think that the BENEFITS are the central issue, and you don't understand the state's perspective ON marriage???\n \n Why do you think the benefits exist in the first place?\n It's BECAUSE of the marriage.\n The marriage came first.\n \n Your whole current presentation is like arguing that people should get the \"tax deduction\" for having a kid, even though they don't have a kid. That it's \"discriminatory\" to not give them a tax deducation for a kid they don't have.\n And NOW, you're even fixating more on the TAX DEDUCTION while you ignore the KID and the PURPOSE of the tax deduction's presence in the first place.\n \n And historically, the \"right of marriage\" has been one of denial.\n Like I pointed out, the marriage license owes its origins to the attempt to prevent blacks and whites from inter-marrying.\n Here, the \"right of marriage\" is about keeping gays from marrying.\n \n \n And on another level, I can't help but wonder if you can appreciate how when the anti-gay crowd illogically complains about gays \"damaging\" marriage, what you are suggesting is ACTUALLY DAMAGING marriage.\n \n Currently, marriage offers benefits AND responsibilities.\n Kind of like having your cake, but then you have to exercise afterwards to burn off the calories.\n What YOU want is a buffet WITHOUT responsibility. Which will allow couples who WOULD marry to ask more and more why they should marry if all they have to do is to sign up for \"benefits\" with no committment.\n \n You don't seem to get that part of the reason that they DO get the benefits is because they HAVE made the committment.

They are not the CENTRAL issue though.\n The CONSTITUTIONAL ARGUMENT for gay marriage does not rest upon the \"civil benefits\" though. It rests on the fact that MARRIAGE is a right.\n \n The \"civil benefits\" are an issue because I pay taxes just like you do.\n Therefore, I should be eligible to marry my partner, just like you are, since there are no legitimate state interests against that marriage.\n It's a separate issue, referring more to a logical argument.\n \n \n \nSo you would be ok with gays being allowed to marry but have no benefits with this marriage?\n\n I am \"ok\" with gays being allowed to marry WITH THE SAME benefits that straight marriages have.\n If straight marriages were neutered of their benefits, then that is a situation equal with your proposition...\n \n \n \nThose are federal constitution requirements.\n\n The \"federal constitution\" requirement I am referring to regards denying people rights, under the 14th amendment.\n Marriage IS A RIGHT, as recognized numerous times. It doesn't matter how many times you want to stick your head in the sand on that fact, it's still a right.\n \n \n \nThe federal government can revoke them.

   "You will undoubtable try to claim that you meant it was \"with marriage\" are you are already backing out of your claim. \n http://4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=220866&postcount=62\n You wrote in response to \"The point there was that marriage benefits themselves aren't even guaranteed by the constitution.\"\n \"The marriage benefits and rights and privileges are protected under the 14th amendment as well.\"\n awaiting your \"you misrepresent me you liar\" post....\n\n The funny thing is that you seem to ALREADY UNDERSTAND the error you have made in trying to paraphrase my statements.\n \n When I said \"MARRIAGE benefits\", of course I was talking about \"with marriage\". The word \"marriage\" was a qualifier for the phrase \"marriage benefits\".\n \n I was not saying that the BENEFITS ALONE are rights.\n I've explained this in other posts.

So the 9th amendment was created with some mysterious list of rights...which is contrary to what was said by many supreme court justices who say it is a substantive right. Ok...this just keeps getting better and better.\n\n Again, snide comments and your incapability to follow an argument are not arguments themselves.\n \n When I talk about the 14th amendment, I am referring to how it TREATS RIGHTS.\n When I talk about the 9th amendment, I am referring to how it ESTABLISHES THE EXISTENCE OF NON-ENUMERATED rights.\n \n You claim the statements of \"many supreme court justices\", but are they a MAJORITY of the justices, or a MINORITY of the MUCH LARGER number of justices who clearly understood what our founding fathers were REALLY saying...\n \n All this proves is your incapability to accurately relay what I am saying. Your willingness to pretend that misrepresentation of my statements is an argument.\n \n The viewing audience will note that Steeeeve habitually CLAIMS that I said this or that, or that I'm changing from this or that, but he DOES NOT PROVE his claim. Even above, when he actually made a SINGULAR ATTEMPT to back up his claim, he UNDERSTOOD as he misrepresented my statements what I was going to say in response.\n He ALREADY UNDERSTOOD what I was going to say my comment meant.\n But he chooses to disbelieve my statements on my comments, and go for his own misrepresentation instead...\n \n \n \nIf by consistent you mean you wanting to always be right then yes, very consistent.\n\n Again, are you guilty of this?\n You keep complaining about things that you are guilty of.\n \n \n \nSo the state can make a definition so long as 5 outta 9 people agree in the supreme court...well how do they know what marriage means? Must have been a secret law class...\n\n Again, snide comments are not an argument.\n Your ignorance of legal history is not an argument.\n \n \n \nWhy is majority not legitmate ? What standard do you have for \"legitmate\"?\n\n The fact that the majority alone does not constitute \"legitimate\" is obvious. The reasoning just as obvious.\n The constitution repeatedly protects the rights of the minorities from the \"tyranny of the majority\".\n \n Every single piece of legislation that SCOTUS has overturned which lacked a legitimate state interest had a MAJORITY VOTE which brought it into law. Miscegenation laws. Sodomy laws.\n \n That fact alone should demonstrate that \"majority\" alone does not mean \"legitimate\".\n \n As for \"what standard\", I would recommend you research for yourself at this stage of the game.\n I mean, I'm all willing to help educate your ignorance, which you are obviously displaying in snide comments left and right, but typical summary that I give on the issue of \"state interest\" is on another computer, and I lack the inclination to type a new one just so you can misrepresent and ignore it...\n \n \n \nSo the judges opinion is just not good enough...you are the one that wants them to define \"legitmate\" and now you critise how they define it. If it isn't your definition then it just isn't right...is that the case?\n\n Actually, no. But thanks for the demonstration that you once again get it wrong when trying to pretend to give my position...\n I'm working off the existing definition of \"legitimate\", which has a variety of portions. One of those portions is consistency and equality.\n \n Like how people could claim reading is a legitimate state interest for voting, but then violate the \"legitimate\" state interest by applying the reading requirement TO ONLY ONE RACE. Blacks.\n Or how people could claim \"procreation\" is a legitimate state interest for marriage, but then violate the \"legitimate\" state interest by applying a procreation requirement TO ONLY GAY COUPLES and never to straight couples.\n \n \n \nOn the contratary. The constitution doesn't agree with me all the time. I can admit this though and I just have to deal or get the law changed...we had an example of this on the abortion forums some time ago where massachusetts required stores to carry the abortion pill....clearly against that 100% but I can't find anything in the US constitution that forbids that.\n\n Same here, with the example I gave.\n We were both wrong. Isn't that refreshing?\n Or am I going to be the only one to admit it...\n \n \n \nNo doubt you can. These rulings came outta thin air. \"lets make a test today\"...yeah, no basis what-so-ever...just what the judge felt was a good idea.\n\n And again, arguments made out of snide comments and ignorance.\n The legal precedents establishing that marriage is a right go back for decades.\n The legal precedents establishing requirements for legitimate state interest in rights discrimination go back even further.\n \n Once again, you FAIL to argue against the actual point. The actual precedents.\n Instead, just snideness, misrepresentations, and ignorance.",

You can look at the Lawerence v. Texas case or actually follow the court to see a majority of the justices use the word \"liberty\" in the 14th amendment to defend marriage, abortion, etc. Your refusal to actually follow the history of the constitution prior to 1950 is the reason you can't get beyond these mysterious rights in the 9th and 14th amendment.

It should be easy since everything you have is based on that. I did my homework, the \"state interest\" tends to be what the \"evolving constitution\" dictates.

   "Or is it more of a case that they get married, and then SEPARATELY OTHER LEGISLATION that says married couples have this benefit and that benefit kick in.\n\n \n That's what I'M saying. You're the one who seems to think that the govt. has some TWO things going on: marriage and the giving of marriage benefits. The giving of marriage benefits IS the interest the govt. has in recognizing marriage. That's ALL it's about, from their perspective. I can't believe you don't get this. \n \n \nLike I said, evidently uncontested, the state could go through and neuter virtually EVERY BENEFIT THEY ASSIGN with marriage, and it would still be a marriage.\n\n \n Uh, no. If the state stopped giving marriage benefits, then they no longer have a reason to recognize marriage. There's no point. From the state's POV, marriage is a non-legal matter at that point. Why would they need to still recognize it? \n \n \nHeck, a married couple could refuse their \"benefits\" left and right and they would STILL BE MARRIED.\n The man and woman could get separate insurance. They could not make claims on each others pensions. They could willingly testify against each other in court (if I understand this right correctly).\n \n Even without the benefits, the marriage STILL EXISTS.\n\n \n They could have made a commitment and a ceremony or whatever, but if they aren't getting marriage benefits, their marriage is irrelevant to the govt. What else does the govt. DO for couples other than give them benefits for marriage? \n \n \nSanctity of marriage? You two are REALLY disturbing in how you seem to think marriage is JUST the benefits. THAT is a REAL threat to the sanctity of marriage... emoticon_wow \n\n \n Dude, this is just downright hateful of you to say, not to mention just wrong. It's YOU who seems to think marriage and govt are interrelated here. YOU'RE the one who doesn't seem to get that you can get married anytime without the benefits, RIGHT NOW. And I've stated, in posting to YOU before that I'd be married even if I weren't getting benefits, so you and I both know you are just chain yanking. If I still had any respect for you remaining whatsoever, it just went right out the window.\n \n \nIs ANYBODY ELSE trying to promulgate that the benefits associated with marriage ARE RIGHTS UNTO THEMSELVES??? \n Is ANYBODY else trying to proclaim that the state's interest in marriage is JUST to GIVE BENEFITS???\n\n \n You DON'T get it. You haven't been listening. Listen carefully: It's not the \"benefits\" that are the right--it's the govt's GIVING OF THE BENEFITS that we're talking about here. That's what you, as a gay person, are fighting for. There's no substance to govt. marriage OTHER than it's giving of benefits. That IS the right you seek. Is this getting through in any way whatsoever? Because it's clear as crystal. \n \n \nMy gawd man. You think I don't understand \"the issue\"? I don't think you get the fact that you and the cheese are standing alone, squeaking loudly without support.\n\n \n And that's one more than is on your team right now, on this issue. You DON'T understand the issue. That's pretty obvious at this point.\n \n \nMarriage, at its core, isn't about the presents.\n Even if a married couple elope and don't get any presents, they are still married.\n \n And likewise, if tomorrow the government decided to try and strip marriage of all its benefits, it would STILL BE MARRIAGE.\n\n \n OMG!!!!! :xbanghead :xbanghead That's exactly what I've been trying to get you to see!!!!  Could you stoop to ANY further level of dishonesty here???? Did you just decided to change your argument since you know you were wrong??? Yes, if the govt. stopped giving benefits, marriage would go on. There's a reason (duh!) That's because the only interest the state has in marriage is to give benefits!!!! I already told you, you can get married ANYTIME. No one is going to block the door to the chapel. You just won't get the benefits? Remember, we've already been over all this. But I'm glad you're finally realizing that marriage and the benefits (the government's part) are two separate things. That's a good sign that maybe you're starting to understand how all this works a bit better (even though you're trying to pretend you were of that thinking all along)\n \n \nYou don't seem to get that the government accounting office's list involves Benefits and Responsibilities like spousal support. Responsibilities that talk about the committment BETWEEN the partners.\n\n \n LOL!!!!!! Foundit, those \"responsibilities\" ARE benefits. Do you not realize that it BENEFITS the spouse for the other spouse to have that responsibility? Do you not realize it's a BENEFIT to the children for the couple to support it? Those demands of resposibility ARE BENEFITS.\n \n \nTell me Jyoshu. Do you really not get that the purpose of marriage IS NOT the benefits?\n\n \n I'm not even going to validate that with a response because you know good and well YOU'RE the one who needs to be asked that question.",

   "WAIT! Did you just define marraige as something? Fine, I define it has a man and a woman...not just two people. If you can define it why can't I?\n \n \n \n \n \n Steeeve, a marriage involves two people, you are more then welcome to define marriage as a man and a woman, but men and women are defined as people. You can argue that if you so choose. If you want to narrow it down to a people of a particular gender then you are discriminating based on gender. Not so long ago there was a great majority that felt a need to define what type of man and what type of woman would be allowed to get married. If a man was a black type man, he could not marry a white type woman. That was called racial discrimination. Which is unconstitutional and thereby unenforceable. Gender discrimination is also unconstitutional despite the fact that you think it's okay in regards to marriage. Let's keep it simple by recognizing the cold hard fact that both men and women are people, regardless of their marital status. But in the event that two people happen to be married they are often referred to as \"married people\". And people who are not a part of the institution of marriage are often referred to as \"single people\". And look over there......................those two people just got engaged. There we have it, men and women are defined as people. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n they can't get benefits if they don't want to marry\n \n \n \n \n That is not the issue at hand. I am well aware that I can't win the Kentucky Derby if I don't ride a horse. What is your point? When shopping for a new home if the contractor is offering free landscaping with your purchase it has nothing to do with those who are not buying a home from that contractor. Buy the house and get the free landscaping. Get married and get the benefits. \n \n \n \n \n \n ...just like a gay person can't get benefits if they dont want to marry (in this case a woman). You make it seem like it is literally impossible for a gay person to marry...when it is not....they just can't do it in the means they want. Same with a single person.\n \n \n \n \n Gay people are seeking govermental acknowledgement of their union as a legally wed couple. Because they want to be legally married. A single who doesn't want to get married is completely irrelevant to this discussion. We are talking about people who WANT to get married and are not allowed to at this point in time.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n You make it seem like it is literally impossible for a gay person to marry...when it is not....they just can't do it in the means they want.\n \n \n \n \n But you can do it the way you want to can't you? And after gay marriage is legalized you can still do it the way you want, can't you? Nothing changes at all for you, except that a group of people that you do not approve of will be able to do something you don't think they should be allowed to do. That's not how it works in a nation where all men are created equal. Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are guaranteed to all of us. It appears that you find happiness by attempting to keep others from being able pursue their own. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n And thats the point...if two single people want to share the benefits but don't want to get married as they have no \"romantic\" involvement then why are saying they can't get benefits for your type can...DISCRIMINATION! :p\n \n \n \n \n \n Hey what if two single people wanted to get some library books, but they didn't want to go through the life threatening process of getting a library card? Then they would be denied the benefits of getting books from the library. And it would not be discrimination. Oh wait yes it would, it would be discriminating against people who didn't want to endanger their lives by obtaining that library card. I totally see your point now................\n \n \n \n \n \n \n It is so funny to hear you guys talk about this and pretty much use the same arguments that your anti-gay marriage folks use. Things like \"that's not the definition of marriage\" and \"marriage is a union between two people...not single people living together\".\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Steeeve, single people that are living together are doing so by choice. They can also get married by choice and receivce the marital perks. They have that option gay people do not. Moving on.\n \n \n \n \n \n HAHA, this is exactly why I don't support your cause, because you are just arguing the same thing the other side is...you just want to draw a different line. The least you can do is just admit that and stop this \"equality\" BS that you don't really care about.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n I do care about it, that is why I tried to explain to you that men and women are just plain old everyday people. Your man / woman concept of marriage illustrates a preoccupation with \"the flesh\", a conflict of interest to your spirit.",

I'm not the one creating rights outta no where, applying them using a different amendment, claiming things NO JUSTICE CLAIMS and then saying someone else is confusing the post.\n\n 1) Not \"outta no where\".\n Loving v Virginia establishes marriage is a right.\n \n 2) \"applying them using a different amendment\"???\n Again, WHY do you think that is a problem?\n The 14th amendment applies to ALL rights.\n \n 3) \"no justice claims\" There are a variety of courts that clearly disagree with you on this.\n \n 4) You are confusing the post.\n THIS SENTENCE of yours is a perfect example.\n \n NONE of what I said above is new.\n But you disregard it all for your own misinterpretation.\n \n \n \nEvery right you claim is actually done using substantive due process and normally not your beloved 9th amendment.\n\n \"due process\" is a legal concept we APPLY TO rights.\n \"Due process\" actually also creates some rights.\n \n But it doesn't create the right of marriage.\n For marriage, it's an APPLICATION to rights.\n \n \n \nSo now the Warren court are the founding fathers?\n\n What the heck do the \"founding fathers\" have to do with this.\n The marriage license, and the right of legal marriage recognition, came AFTER the founding fathers. It was used as a tool to enforce miscegenation laws.\n \n Just because the founding fathers didn't say something doesn't mean it's not applicable.\n I think you've got your head stuck too much in the philosophy of needing people who have been dead for hundreds of years to tell you how to think...\n \n \n \n So you think justices should create rights? I still don't recall Loving saying the \"right to marry\" is in the 9th amendment.\n\n 1) Justice acknowledge the existence of rights.\n 2) Actually, I use \"Loving\" because of its multiple conveniences.\n They CITE PRECEDENT acknowledging the existence of marriage. OTHER CASES BEFORE which explicitly stated that marriage is a right.\n \n 3) And, as always, you try to distort and malign simple English to come away with bizarre conclusions as to what is being said.\n The \"right to marry\" is not \"in\" the 9th amendment.\n The 9th amendment acknowledges the existence of NON-ENUMERATED RIGHTS, which allows the courts to do away with any stupid argument that \"marriage isn't in the constitution, and thus not a right\".\n THAT is what the 9th amendment does.\n \n \n \n\"These statutes also deprive the Lovings of liberty without due process of law in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \"\n I also disagree with that statement...but thats a different story\n\n No. I think it's the same story.\n You two are playing an inane routine whereby you want to try and distort my position into a laughable farce...\n ... but here is something that I want to know about what you ACTUALLY believe.\n \n Do you think Loving v Virginia should have been decided so that the Loving couple's marriage SHOULD NOT be recognized by the state?\n I believe you may have already answered this, but I would love a refresher, also a straight answer for the viewing audience....",

   "That's what I'M saying. You're the one who seems to think that the govt. has some TWO things going on: marriage and the giving of marriage benefits. The giving of marriage benefits IS the interest the govt. has in recognizing marriage. That's ALL it's about, from their perspective. I can't believe you don't get this. \n\n What you don't get is that there are MULTIPLE PIECES OF LEGISLATION on this. And they all have INDEPENDENT ASPECTS.\n \n There are laws establishing the requirements for legal recognition of marriage.\n There are OTHER LAWS establishing the benefits and privileges which are associated with marriage.\n OTHER laws.\n \n Do you REALLY THINK that the government is recognizing marriage just so it can give out benefits to married people?\n NO. It recognizes marriage because marriage HELPS SOCIETY and its stability.\n Hell. Even YOUR SIDE argues that much, so it truly baffles me this position I see whereby you seem to think marriage is ABOUT THE BENEFITS for the government.\n \n The benefits are there to HELP the marriage.\n Not to BE the point of the marriage. \n \n \n \nUh, no. If the state stopped giving marriage benefits, then they no longer have a reason to recognize marriage. There's no point. From the state's POV, marriage is a non-legal matter at that point. Why would they need to still recognize it? \n\n Marriage enhances society's stability.\n THAT is why they give benefits for marriage.\n \n Which came first Jyoshu?\n Governmental recognition of the marriage license?\n Or the laundry list of over 1,000 benefits that come with marriage?\n \n \n \nThey could have made a commitment and a ceremony or whatever, but if they aren't getting marriage benefits, their marriage is irrelevant to the govt. What else does the govt. DO for couples other than give them benefits for marriage?\n\n The government's involvement is to help strengthen the marriage bond.\n THAT is their purpose for being involved in marriage.\n \n WHY do they want to strengthen the marriage bond?\n Because marriages AID SOCIETY. \n \n \n \nDude, this is just downright hateful of you to say, not to mention just wrong.\n\n It's the fricken truth.\n ANYBODY who wants to trivialize marriage by separating the marriage benefits FROM THE MARRIAGE ITSELF is only helping to damage marriage.\n Dick and Jane don't need to get married to get on each others insurance.\n Dick and Jane don't need to \"commit\" to anything to get the benefits of marriage.\n They can get the \"benefits\" without the \"hassle\" of the marriage committment, by what you are talking about.\n \n It's not \"hateful\".\n It's an accurate observation of the conclusion of what you are advocating.\n \n \n \nIt's YOU who seems to think marriage and govt are interrelated here. YOU'RE the one who doesn't seem to get that you can get married anytime without the benefits, RIGHT NOW.\n\n Jyoshu. Please write this down.\n Write it down a 100 times on a blackboard if necessary.\n I GET the fact that I can \"marry\" at any time without governmental recognition.\n \n The point is that, by the constitution, that should not be MY ONLY OPTION.\n \n Do you think somebody could have just told the \"Loving\" couple of Loving v Virginia that \"you can just get married in a chapel, without governmental recognition\"...\n Would that be acceptable to them?\n \n \n \nAnd I've stated, in posting to YOU before that I'd be married even if I weren't getting benefits, so you and I both know you are just chain yanking.\n\n No. I'm not.\n Would you give the same approach to the Loving couple?\n \n There are significant ideals in play here that you are blindly disregarding in your desire for me to not have legal recognition of marriage.\n MOREOVER, it's interesting to note that your \"interest\" in marriage IS PURELY GOVERNMENTAL.\n You obviously don't care that I can \"marry\" without the government. You don't care that this is legal for me.\n You ONLY CARE about the LEGAL definition of marriage...\n \n Jyoshu. You're revealing more about YOURSELF than you are about me...\n \n \n \nIf I still had any respect for you remaining whatsoever, it just went right out the window.\n\n Oh wow.\n I thought we had been on the same page on that for quite some time now.\n I guess not.\n But now it's equal, eh?\n \n \n \nYou DON'T get it. You haven't been listening. Listen carefully: It's not the \"benefits\" that are the right--it's the govt's GIVING OF THE BENEFITS that we're talking about here.\n\n Wow. Talk about semantical hand-waving.\n Okay. Here's a challenge for you...\n Show me ANY COURT RULING, or even a court challenge if you can't find a ruling, whereby people have stated that the \"GIVING OF THE BENEFITS\" is a factor guaranteed by the constitution independent of marriage.\n \n Can you do that?\n \n What you don't seem to want to get is that I don't see ANYBODY ELSE trying this stupid farce that you and Steeeeve are trying to pull off.\n You're arguing something out of a fantasy book. Not out of constitutional precedent.\n \n Over and over again, I give legal precedents for my statements. Loving v Virginia. Lawrence v Texas. Romer v Evans.\n Since we started this stupid \"non-married couples should be given marriage benefits\" rant, I have NEVER seen ANY legal precedent come from you.\n Nothing.\n \n So quit with the stupid \"You DON'T get it\" XXXX.\n I get it. I get the WHOLE big picture here.\n It's you who doesn't get how lame your argument is...\n \n \n \nOMG!!!!! :xbanghead :xbanghead That's exactly what I've been trying to get you to see!!!!  Could you stoop to ANY further level of dishonesty here???? Did you just decided to change your argument since you know you were wrong???\n\n Quote me where I argued what you claim I argued...\n Once again, any confusion here is yours.\n My stance is not a \"change\" from anything.\n \n \n \nYes, if the govt. stopped giving benefits, marriage would go on. There's a reason (duh!) That's because the only interest the state has in marriage is to give benefits!!!!\n\n Wrong-o.\n The state's interest in marriage is to HELP marriage, because marriage HELPS society.\n \n Like I have been asking over and over again, do you REALLY THINK that the government just decided that they should hand out benefits like candy from a pinata to married people for no reason???\n NO.\n That's why your whole \"the only interest the state has in marriage is to give benefits\" is just plain stupid.\n \n \n \nBut I'm glad you're finally realizing that marriage and the benefits (the government's part) are two separate things. That's a good sign that maybe you're starting to understand how all this works a bit better (even though you're trying to pretend you were of that thinking all along)\n\n Show me any quote of mine where I claimed they weren't two separate things.\n Enough of these mindless accusations.\n \n Where's that quote again? Oh yeah. Here it is...\n \"If you are going to make that accusation, you need to pony up and prove it.\"\n ***Jyoshu\n \n \n \nI'm not even going to validate that with a response because you know good and well YOU'RE the one who needs to be asked that question.\n\n The really stupid thing about this reply is that I HAVE ALREADY ANSWERED that question.\n But over and over again, you ignore my questions to you...\n No surprises there...",

   "Yes, that's all part of govt. recognition of marriage. It crosses both federal AND state laws. The federal govt. recognizes marriage SO that the states can give benefit to couples.\n\n We have a SERIOUS disjoint in reasoning here, and I don't think you recognize it.\n \n Your approach to this is like saying \"Why did I drive the car to the store? Because I wanted the car to be parked in the store parking lot.\"\n \n To which the obvious rejoinder is, \"WHY did you want the car to be parked there?\"\n \n Likewise, you are claiming that the state recognizes marriage \"SO that the state can give benefits to couples\".\n But you never answer the question of WHY would the state want to give benefits to couples. Not once do you even fathom the existence of that question.\n \n My answer is simple, and it DOES answer the question you can't. We give married couples marriage benefits TO STRENGTHEN the marriage, because marriage STRENGTHENS society.\n \n \n \nDo you REALLY THINK that the government is recognizing marriage just so it can give out benefits to married people?\n NO. It recognizes marriage because marriage HELPS SOCIETY and its stability.\n\n \nWhat reason would it have to recognize marriage for that purpose?\n\n emoticon_wow emoticon_wow emoticon_wow \n You can't comprehend why the government would recognize marriage to make society more stable???\n You don't think the government has an interest in a stable society???\n \n Zounds! :xbanghead \n Seriously. I just have to ask.\n Do you SERIOUSLY need me to answer that question for you???\n Because it just blows my mind that you would even try asking that question.\n It's like asking \"Which way does earth's gravity pull?\"\n \n \n \nThe only reason it would do so would be to promote marriage, and so we are right back to it's giving of benefits. From the govt's perspective, it's ALL ABOUT THE BENEFITS.\n\n WOW!\n So you think that we give marriage benefits AS A REWARD for marriage???\n \n Okay now. Let's back-track a few pages...\n Back to a time and place where two posters were sitting behind their computer screens arguing that marriage benefits should be given to couples WHO ARE NOT married.\n \n Do you notice any disjoint in the two presentations???\n Or do I need to spell that out too?\n \n \n \nFrom the govt.'s standpoint they ARE the marriage. It sees it as something to recognize for the giving of benefits.\n\n And you can back up this claim with what exactly???\n \n \"If you are going to make that accusation, you need to pony up and prove it.\"\n ***Jyoshu\n \n \n \nRight--it's WHY THEY RECOGNIZE MARRIAGE--to give it benefits.\n\n Again, that's like saying we drove the car to the store so the car would be in the parking lot...\n WHY would they want to give marriage \"benefits\"?\n You finally got around to answering that question, I believe...\n \n \n \nThe benefits increased over time. But the answer to your question is that benefits and govt. recognition came at the same time, because they are, for all practical purposes the same thing from the govt.'s standpoint.\n\n No. They aren't.\n Look at ANY legislation on marriage. Do they say that couples who are married and get insurance benefits will get this new benefit???\n Or do they JUST TALK ABOUT MARRIED COUPLES???\n \n Cause you see, a married couple DOES NOT HAVE TO take advantage of their benefits. They can get separate car insurance. They can not tell the hospital that they are husband and wife, and take the repercussions of withholding that info.\n \n But they ARE STILL MARRIED.\n Again, you are confusing the car ACCESSORIES with the car itself.\n \n \n \nPaperwork and beuracratic process doesn't care about the wedding, Foundit. It doesn't care about the the color of the cake or the works spoken in the vows.\n\n 1) I'm not talking about the wedding or the cake. Strawman...\n 2) Likewise, two people being married DOES NOT CARE about whether or not the couple ACTUALLY USE any of their benefits.\n \n \n \nBy the way, don't confuse census data with legal marriage recognition. I'm wondering if your insistence on the idea that govt. recognizes marriage to some degree independent of the purpose of benefits is because you assume that the seeing of marriage in census data amounts to \"recognition.\" That's not what this is about.\n\n Gee. Something I never brought up...\n And you're wondering if I'm \"confusing\" an issue that was never even mentioned.\n Put your mind at ease. I'm not talking about that.\n \n What I AM talking about is the BARE ESSENCE of the thing. Just the WEDDING LICENSE ITSELF.\n If THAT was all that existed, then the government WOULD STILL have to recognize a gay couple's right to be named on one.\n \n \n \nAnd how do you think that is accomplished, Foundit?? (Hint: the benefits!)\n\n I was right...\n PURE disjoint in our thought processes, and hopefully we can tie them together.\n \n DUH!!!\n I AGREE that they help marriage with marriage benefits, and that is how they help society.\n I AGREE with that.\n THAT was MY POINT.\n \n I'm trying to get you to go ANOTHER STEP in realizing that the PURPOSE of marriage benefits IS NOT THE BENEFITS, but rather the EFFECT MARRIAGE HAS ON SOCIETY.\n \n \n \nThat's odd, because I'd think if someone married JUST for the benefits (one and the same, you see), it would be pretty darn shallow.\n\n emoticon_wow \n They are one and the same...\n But if somebody married for just the benefits, THAT would be shallow...\n \n Forest for the trees...\n \n \n \nI already told you I'd be married regardless of the benefits, so pardon me if I find it pretty disingenuous of you to level such assertions at me.\n\n My comment HAD NOTHING to do with YOUR PERSONAL outlook on marriage. So your offense is purely in your head regarding any implications about your own \"marriage\"...\n It was an observation on how OTHERS would be changed by your new system regarding marriage and marriage benefits. How THEY would treat it when the \"benefits\" are removed from the \"responsibility\" of marriage.\n \n But nice try to side-step my argument. All it did was give me one more chance to repeat what my argument REALLY is to correct your misrepresentation....\n \n \n \nNo, because their's was a case where they were wanting to MARRY, not have a gay union. Remember, society's understanding of marriage is opposite-sex--the reason you want to redefine it. I find it interesting that you always try to go back to Loving when Loving was not decided based on a marriage concept that was other than opposite-sex.\n\n Good gawd. We're back to this obfuscation again.\n Jyoshu. I realize you may not want to admit it, but society's rules on marriage HAVE CONSISTENTLY CHANGED OVER TIME.\n Fifty years ago, a HUGE majority in this country defined marriage by BOTH \"opposite sex\" and \"SAME RACE\".\n \n Today's CURRENT society has the popular definition as just \"opposite sex\".\n But back when Loving v Virginia was decided, THEIR definition WAS NOT TODAY'S definition.\n THEIR definition WAS a change from the \"modern\" definition (of that day).\n \n And you are ONCE AGAIN obfuscating my point.\n My point did not rest upon the TYPE of couple in Loving v Virginia.\n It was regarding THEIR MOTIVATION for marrying, and how modern gays have the SAME MOTIVATION for marrying.\n It was regarding THEIR MOTIVATION for getting the state to recognize their marriage, just like gays have today...\n \n So, as I often do when you obfuscate, I'll repeat the argument...\n \n Do you think somebody could have just told the \"Loving\" couple of Loving v Virginia that \"you can just get married in a chapel, without governmental recognition\"...\n Would that be acceptable to them?",

You are in obfuscating OVER-DRIVE this afternoon.\n My point was regarding YOUR POSITION on this issue, and the hypocrisy of your position.\n \n You CLAIM to be against the redefinition of marriage, but it's interesting to note that you HAVE NO PROBLEM with me \"redefining\" marriage in a non-legal way.\n Your ONLY seeming issue is with a LEGAL redefinition of marriage.\n \n \n \nOf course not; that's like asking me to show you a court case that shows social security is about benefits to seniors instead of some other independent reason for it's existence. It's basic common sense, Foundit. Courts don't have to define what hasn't even been challenged.\n\n You realize, of course, that this basically mutes your earlier contentions.\n Your attempts to complain about non-married couples not getting rights, and trying to tie that argument into the gay rights marriage?\n \n And the \"hasn't even been challenged\" aspect also goes to show you admitting that your outlook upon that issue is yours and virtually yours alone...\n \n And you think I'm the one out of touch with reality!\n You've got all the puzzle pieces, but you can't figure out what you're putting together...\n \n \n \nYou've missed the whole point, then.

I have to repeat myself with you so much it's like a broken record for a deaf person...\n The point where they ARE NOT \"essentially identical\" comes in with the LEGITIMATE STATE INTEREST.\n \n If the other groups lack a legitimate state interest, then they lose. Plain and simple.\n That's what happened in Loving v Virginia. The state DEFINED MARRIAGE as being opposite sex / same race. That was their DEFINITION Jyoshu.\n And if you ever bothered to READ Loving v Virginia, you'ld see that they said this definition was unconstitutional. They DID NOT say that because of any \"essential\" definition of \"marriage\" being JUST about \"man / woman\".\n They DID it because the state lacked a LEGITIMATE STATE REASON for racial discrimination in marriage.\n \n \n \nThen go ahead and tell me what other interest it has in legal recognition, Foundit. You keep saying \"because it benefits society\" but the govt. has not need to recognize on those grounds unless it PROMOTES it, which it does VIA BENEFITS. So we're right back to the benefits.\n\n 1) Are you contesting the fact that marriage benefits society?\n Because if you agree that marriage benefits society, your request is meaningless.\n 2) As I pointed out above, OF COURSE these benefits help \"promote\" marriage. I never argued otherwise. They also STRENGTHEN marriage, and a myriad of other building verbs.\n 3) My point of contention HAS NEVER been about benefits having a positive effect on marriage. I have been SAYING OVER AND OVER again that marriage benefits have a positive effect on marriage.\n My point has been that the GIVING of the benefits IS NOT THE REASON for giving the benefits.\n The GIVING of the benefits helps to STRENGTHEN marriage, and thus help STRENGTHEN society.\n My point of contention is to get you to take the next obvious step in development. That it's not JUST about giving benefits...",

That's WHY the govt. recognizes marriage, to give the benefits. It's seems you are trying to prove the the goals over the real-world effect; the fact that the govt. wants to promote marriage isn't really relevant; gays are fighting to get marriage benefits. That's what the govt. does. That's what legally married entails. Period. Anything else is superfluous and is nothing more than in the realm of ideas and goals. \n \n \nMy answer is simple, and it DOES answer the question you can't.

Where did you get that? i never claimed such at all. I'm saying that the benefits are all there essentially is to marriage from the govt.'s perspective. You keep wanting to shift into the realm of \"goals\" here, and that's not really what we're talking about. We're talking about what marriage IS to the govt from their perspective.

   "No, the STORE is the benefits, not the parking lot.\n\n The point of an analogy is often to help demonstrate deficiencies in another person's thinking.\n Here, you rewrite mine without any comment as to how my thinking is supposedly wrong.\n You just rewrite it. No explanation given. No pretense as to how my analogy was supposedly wrong...\n emoticon_wow \n \n You're not even trying to argue. Your response itself ignores several factors of the analogy in the rush to rewrite it.\n \n Working with your analogy, bypassing the fact that you failed to learn anything from mine...\n \n Let's say a man goes to the store to get \"marriage benefits\"...\n WHY does the store give out these \"marriage benefits\"?\n Do they exist just to give out those \"marriage benefits\"?\n Or do they do it to BRING IN MONEY. That, by analogy, being the driving issue / motivation for the government's actions.\n The government gives out marriage benefits why? To improve society's stability.\n \n You're playing a game of cause and effect Jyoshu, and you're claiming the effect IS the cause. And in the big scheme of things, ESPECIALLY considering the government, it doesn't make sense.\n Take welfare for example. Does welfare exist just to give poor people money? Or does it exist because it helps poor people not to starve. To help them to get a roof over their head?\n \n \n \nYou've already done that: on of the few times you've been correct on this--because it promotes and encourages marriage. That's WHY the govt. recognizes marriage, to give the benefits.\n\n Soooo close, yet so far away...\n And on a lot of levels, it's like you're saying \"tom-ay-to\", and I'm saying \"tom-ah-to\".\n The only problem being that we're talking about spaghetti sauce and the ONLY thing you're focusing on is \"tom-ay-to\", while I bring up the meat and the mushrooms and the ...\n \n You admit I'm \"correct on this\".\n What exactly am I \"incorrect\" on Jyoshu?\n Where am I significantly wrong that doesn't boil down to a shift in perception?\n \n \n \nIt's seems you are trying to prove the the goals over the real-world effect;\n\n PERFECT place to stop you...\n I am trying to say the PURPOSE of something IS THE GOALS. The goal of a better society.\n Whereas I see you trying to say the PURPOSE of something is the MECHANISMS of the PLAN. The giving of the marriage benefits.\n \n The purpose of a plan IS NOT the plan itself.\n \n \n \nthe fact that the govt. wants to promote marriage isn't really relevant; gays are fighting to get marriage benefits.\n\n Stop you here again, because you just don't get it.\n Sitting at the back as opposed to sitting at the front doesn't have any real \"benefits\".\n What YOU don't seem to get is that EVEN IF THERE WERE NO MARRIAGE BENEFITS, gays would be fighting for gay marriage, because it's a fight against discrimination. Unjustified discrimination.\n \n Like I said earlier, the marriage benefits add an additional nuance, but it's the MARRIAGE which is the focus.\n LOOK at the marriage law-suits. How many say \"We are a gay couple and I want duo insurance\"?\n Typically it revolves around \"We are a gay couple, and we want to MARRY.\"\n \n YOU are myopically focusing and fixating on the marriage benefits.\n You are failing to hear me when I repeatedly tell you that it's the MARRIAGE ITSELF which is the driving force.\n \n \n \nThat's what the govt. does. That's what legally married entails. Period. Anything else is superfluous and is nothing more than in the realm of ideas and goals.\n\n And we get back to the whole issue where you are diminishing the governmental role in \"marriage\", but it's THE ONLY ISSUE YOU FIXATE ON.\n It's hilarious to note how on one hand you try to diminish governmental marriage to JUST the marriage benefits...\n ... but on the other hand you claim it's the REDEFINITION that you don't like about marriage.\n And going a step further, you have no problem with us getting these \"marriage benefits\" you claim are the government's PURPOSE in marriage under a different name...\n So the heart and soul of why YOU CLAIM the government is interested in marriage, is okay for us to get as long as it's just under a different name.\n \n I can't help but wonder if you realize how amazingly crippling this is to your self-proclaimed motivation, as you are refusing to respond to it. Earlier you obfuscated from my point. Now, you are avoiding it.\n \n \n \nI never said that was not the case. It doesn't change the fact that for the govt,. it's about the benefits. That's all that matters in terms of how they deal with couples. Period.\n\n Again, we come to an area where you refuse to contradict, but you repeat your perspective. A perspective which is different, but not contradictory of my points...\n Tell me, if all it is to the government is \"marriage benefits\", then what is the significance of just including the SAME BENEFITS under a different name???\n \n \n \nHuh?? Where did you get that? i never claimed such at all.\n\n No. You didn't \"claim\" that, but you DID ASK ME A SPECIFIC QUESTION querying my statement.\n Let's repeat...\n \n foundit66: \"It recognizes marriage because marriage HELPS SOCIETY and its stability.\"\n jyoshu: \"What reason would it have to recognize marriage for that purpose?\"\n \n Ergo, my question to your question.\n Do you understand why the government would recognize marriage to help society and its stability?\n \n Note, and I'm trying to cut off your obfuscation in advance, I am not questioning whether you AGREE WITH MY ASSESSMENT. I'm asking whether or not you understand why the government WOULD recognize marriage to help society and its stability.\n \n You questioned the reason for my claimed connection.\n Even if you don't agree with my claimed connection, surely even you can understand the REASON WHY such a connection could logically exist.\n \n \n \nYou keep wanting to shift into the realm of \"goals\" here, and that's not really what we're talking about. We're talking about what marriage IS to the govt from their perspective. On paper, it plays out in the form of giving benefits to couples.\n\n No, Jyoshu, that is what YOU don't want to talk about.\n I am talking about the REASON WHY GOVERNMENT GIVES MARRIAGE BENEFITS.\n The PURPOSE the government has in giving them out.\n \n I think you're finally coming to realize that you're out of rope, and at the end you've hung yourself.\n So now, you want to frame the discussion in a COMPLETELY NARROW and UTTERLY MEANINGLESS way...\n \n There are sooooo many aspects of this discussion you have just COMPLETELY DROPPED. And now, you're essentially left with nothing.\n Just out of curiousity, of the XXXX you're continuing to harp on that you haven't dropped, what MEANING do you think it has for preventing gay marriage???\n Does it have ANY meaning? Any at all?\n \n Or are you just trying to narrow the focus of the conversation away from points you can no longer address to avoid admitting that you are at the end of your rope?\n \n (And as a fore-warning, don't even try pretending that I have been the one \"dropping\" things, because you should know by now that I am more than happy to go back and bring up a LAUNDRY LIST of questions you never answered, and points that you stopped discussing...)\n \n \n \nFor making a commitment, sure. On the couples' end, the marriage IS the commitment they make between the two of them. On the govt's end, on paper, it's about the benefits. I don't understand why this is so hard fo you. you're trying to make this WAAAAAAY too complicated.\n\n Actually, I think you're trying to over-simplify it, like I have been showing in analogy after analogy.\n But to put it simply.\n 1) The MARRIAGE ITSELF is the right. Not the \"benefits\" of marriage.\n 2) The PURPOSE the government gives out marriage benefits is not just because they want to give out marriage benefits. It's because giving out marriage benefits STRENGTHEN the marriages, which in turn STRENGTHENS society. And that is a goal of our government. To strengthen society.\n \n I think our current disjoint rests solely on the fact that you want to focus AWAY FROM any discussion of \"purpose\", and focus EXCLUSIVELY on the letter of the law.\n And quite frankly, that's a meaningless discussion.\n \n \n \nCause you see, a married couple DOES NOT HAVE TO take advantage of their benefits. \n\n \nIt doesn't matter--the govt has still made the benefit available. They've given the benefit.\n\n This sounds like one of those \"if a tree falls in the forest\" scenarios.\n If the government makes marriage benefits available, but a married couple doesn't partake of them, does that mean that the government has \"given\" anything?\n \n If I tell John that he can come by my house and get brownies, but he never comes by to get them, then I have not \"given\" him anything.\n If the married couple does not partake of the marriage benefits, they have not been \"given\" marriage benefits.\n \n \n \nYou might as well be trying to argue that social security is about something other than giving social security.\n\n And I can't help but think this is an example I should have come up with, because I think it helps prove my point...\n \n Again, you think that the purpose of a social program is about GIVING the social program.\n Like saying the purpose of driving to the store is to DRIVE to the store.\n \n Maybe you need to listen to Bush talk about Social Security reform. See if he just talks about the program being about giving social security.\n Your analysis just plain lacks any depth...",

How do you know she was raped?\n \n \n I have stated that Loving v Virginia establishes marriage is a right.\n So it wasn't a right before? The judges just decided to make it one? I will actually admit to this one that I am actually trying to find out if you are saying this...as \"establish\" can mean create. \n \n \n\"due process\" is a legal concept we APPLY TO rights.\n \"Due process\" actually also creates some rights.\n Do you know what substantive due process is? (i'm asking this in a nice way...please don't take it wrong)\n \n \nWhat the heck do the \"founding fathers\" have to do with this.\n You brought it up...that was my point...I didn't think they had anything to do with this.\n \n \nActually, I use \"Loving\" because of its multiple conveniences.\n They CITE PRECEDENT acknowledging the existence of marriage. OTHER CASES BEFORE which explicitly stated that marriage is a right.\n One other...that 1888 case doesn't say that really. So is marriage a constitutional right or just a regular right in your opinion?\n \n \n3) And, as always, you try to distort and malign simple English to come away with bizarre conclusions as to what is being said.\n The \"right to marry\" is not \"in\" the 9th amendment.\n The 9th amendment acknowledges the existence of NON-ENUMERATED RIGHTS, which allows the courts to do away with any stupid argument that \"marriage isn't in the constitution, and thus not a right\".\n THAT is what the 9th amendment does.\nYet they said the right was from the 14th amendment in the substantive rights in the word \"liberty\"....never the less, lets assume marriage is a right, the 14th amendment says these can be taken away with \"due process\"...why doesn't due process mean the democractic process set up in the constitution? Perhaps you think it can be subject to the democractic process. Your next argument would be \"equal protection\"(i assume) which is more valid than a substantive argument. In this case I would first like to ask you would it be ok (in your view of the constitution) if the states got rid of marriage all together? Afterall even Loving admitted the states have full power of marriage.\n \n \n\n No. I think it's the same story.\n You two are playing an inane routine whereby you want to try and distort my position into a laughable farce...\n ... but here is something that I want to know about what you ACTUALLY believe.\n wait, you realize my quote was from the Loving case right? I wasn't \"distorting\" anything.\n \n \n\n Do you think Loving v Virginia should have been decided so that the Loving couple's marriage SHOULD NOT be recognized by the state?\n I believe you may have already answered this, but I would love a refresher, also a straight answer for the viewing audience....\nI think the 14th amendment equal protection clause only deals with race in a strict way (it was one of the \"slavery amendments\" after all) and so the case should have just done the equal protection argument. They had it right when they said \n \n \"the fact of equal application does not immunize the statute from the very heavy burden of justification which the Fourteenth Amendment has traditionally required of state statutes drawn according to race.\"\n \n So in conclusion, yes VA was wrong (as they normally are) and the Lovings should have been able to marry...but only on equal protection grounds. \n \n Now lets assume no equal protection clause existed. I would have to say that VA could (sadly) ban interracial marriage. In other words I don't think the justices can say a law is unconstitional because it is morally wrong even though this clearly was a case of a morally wrong law.\n \n I think this was an overall nice post :) please do one in return.",

You're becoming a walking cause for making mountains out of molehills, arguing semantics over substance.\n\n Seriously Jyoshu.\n Are you saying that Rosa Parks was making a mountain out of a molehill?\n Or do you see something of substance in her fight that I haven't stated?\n \n Because believe you me, I see a LOT MORE of importance to Rosa Parks' fight than just a \"seat\".\n I say what I said because by YOUR ARGUMENT, I see you are trying to diminish the fight for equality to \"just a seat\".\n \n \n \nOr maybe your problem is that you think of benefits as over and above rights somehow or that somehow BECAUSE they're called \"benefits\" that they don't fall into the realm of people having a RIGHT to them.\n\n The DISCRIMINATION is important.

To not blur the lines of what IS recognized as A right, and what the law states that people are \"entitled to\".\n \n Now then, do you disagree with ANYTHING that I just said.\n Or do you just not like the WAY I said it?\n \n I want a serious answer to this question.",

   "Or maybe your problem is that you think of benefits as over and above rights somehow or that somehow BECAUSE they're called \"benefits\" that they don't fall into the realm of people having a RIGHT to them. I don't know, but at this point it's not worth all this. Like I said, if it's terminology that you're so hung up on, call them RIGHTS. Heck, call 'em pink elephants if it helps you.\n\n Wow.\n If you think I want to call the marriage benefits \"rights\", then you have virtually NO CLUE as to what I have been saying.\n Just plain wow!\n \n \n \nAnd yet rather than focus on that, you've now spent a lot of your posts in this this thread fixated on this semantic hangup of yours that I'm considering couples' benefits to be what marriage recog. is for.\n\n No, Jyoshu, I've spent a lot of my posts in this thread RESPONDING TO WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT.\n YOU asked me what I thought the governmental purpose of recognizing marriage was.\n I stated it. I stated that the PURPOSE of recognizing marriage is because marriage strengthens society, and that is the interest of the government.\n Loving v Virginia says that marriage is \"fundamental to our very existence and survival\". It says nothing about a governmental interest to hand out benefits...\n \n And then YOU spent a lot of time insisting that my perspective was wrong. YOU DROPPED OTHER ARGUMENTS to discuss this irrelevant issue.\n Sure. I followed you along for the ride, but YOU lead the show.\n \n \n \nIf you wanted to discuss the other, one would think you'd have stuck to the other. I told you, the semantic issue of \"benefit\" isn't worth all this. To me anyway. maybe it is to you.\n\n No. It's not worth ANYTHING to me, and I explicitly told you that in a previous post. I said it was devoid of meaning for the issue of gay marriage.\n \n AND PRECISELY as I predicted, you are now trying to blame this derailment of relevance on me. YOU DROPPED ISSUES right and left which actually had a little merit to fixate on how you just couldn't believe how I would think that the government's \"purpose\" for recognizing marriage and for giving marriage benefits was anything other than wanting to give benefits.\n \n This was all you baby.\n \n \n \nAh, I see--you're seeing things again. The black helicopters aren't real, Foundit. There's no attempt to fool anybody afoot, and nobody is following you.\n\n What the heck are you babbling about now?\n \n \n \nThe only reason this sideshow is going on is because you can't seem to drop it (yet another example of this sort of thing from you).\n\n ROFLMAO!!!\n Yeah. SINGLE-HANDEDLY, and ALL BY MYSELF, I have been insisting we talk about this while you and Steeeeve have been trying to beg me to discuss something else.\n \n Seriously Jyoshu. I would LOVE to pick up other relevant issues.\n Relevant issues in our discussion that YOU DROPPED.\n \n Like the importance of giving out marriage benefits to couples who don't want to marry. And how that affects gay marriage.\n Like the legitimate state interest for gay marriage, and the legitimate state interest for other forms of marriage.\n \n MULTIPLE topics that you keep dropping, and you kept dropping, just so you could keep harping on this topic.\n \n But it's all me. Just because I continue to talk about SPECIFICALLY what you said in your last post.\n \n The question remains. If YOU wanted to discuss other topics, WHY AREN'T YOU???\n The above are the topics I would love to hit on.\n \n Are you game?\n Or are you just going to continue to whine about how all I want to talk about is THIS irrelevant topic.\n \n \n \nBack to the issue (if you can), there are no significant differences between the arguement for gay marriage recognition, and say, co-habitation recognition, or polygamy marriage recognition.\n\n False. False. Wrong. Just plain WRONG.\n There ARE significant differences.\n \n 1) Cohabitation? A male-female cohabitation HAS THE OPTION to marry.\n Gay couples CANNOT LEGALLY MARRY.\n That's a HUGE difference.\n The difference between a white man CHOOSING not to drink from the white fountain, and a black man being LEGALLY RESTRICTED from drinking from the white fountain.\n \n 2) Polygamy? The laws just aren't set up for polygamy marriage. There are WAYYYY too many gaps in the law.\n If a man marries two women, and one of them divorces, does the other wife have the capacity to sue for alimony?\n And that's just the tip of the ice-berg.\n \n \n \nCan you give an compelling differences that are LEGAL ones?\n\n Are you for real???\n I HAVE ALREADY DONE THIS on a variety of different occasions in conversations that YOU DROPPED.\n \n And now you pretend like you're bringing something new to the table... Something that I've refused to touch on...\n emoticon_xdonno",

This is why I called you what I did...and deservingly so.\n \n\n If a tree falls in the woods with nobody watching, does it make a sound?\n Does a right to marriage exist in this country before anybody says that it's a right? Yes.\n Ok, then who created this as a right?\n \n \nThe 9th amendment acknowledges that rights exist that are not explicitly listed in the constitution. It seems your reasoning would establish that they aren't really rights until somebody says they are.\n It's precisely that line of thinking that the 9th amendment was created to counter.\n Fine, there are rights outside the constitution...who establishes these? How do you know \"marriage\" was one of these rights they mean't to have when writting the 9th?\n \n \n\n Don't know.\n Don't care.\n haha, you are the one that thinks the 9th amendment means a right to marriage exists outside the constitution.

Or are you just going to insult in every post no matter what?\n \n \n\n My comments revolve around you not having knowledge on a subject. If you find that insulting, that you're own issue. If the moderator finds it insulting, he'll pull it.\n He/she pulls stuff that is reported normally. I have more knowledge on the constitution then you do it seems. You have no basis for decisions and no understanding of the history behind the document. This was clear when you discussed the 1st amendment and it is clear when you talk about the 9th and 14th amendment. It is also clear when you contradict yourself and then claim you didn't when called on it. You mask this by insulting people every chance you get and then change directions in posting to try and tear down the other person. The only reason I even post to you know is to give myself amuzement by reading such ridiculous claims and statements...but you probably knew that :)\n \n \n\n Grow up Steeeeve. If you want to complain about \"insults\", then stop throwing them around yourself.\n I complain that this is all you do. You just can't stop.

   "All I am seeing in your post is a bunch of contradictions...marriage is not a right from the 9th amendment before it was...perhaps its the 14th amendment now..who knows? It existed outta no where and was just uncovered by a judge some how (I suppose they could say anything was a right if thats the standard). You say you use the current legal precedent as your backing for what you say as if legal precdent is always right but then when someone quotes the 3 cases that upheld the ban you all of a sudden find this precedent to be incorrect.\n \n Why can't you just give a straight answer about how the constitution guarntees a right to marriage for gay couples? You obviously believe it is beyond just an \"equal protection issue\" and that \"marriage\" is actually a right guarnteed by the constitution. If this is incorrect please say so but atleast answer me this ( I don't recal you answering it when I asked the first time) Can a state get rid of marriage all together? Furthermore, explain how a judge discovers a right that exists due to the 9th amendment? What criteria is used!? Your round-a-bout answers will just not due anymore...give it to me straight for once. Finally, explain why marriage gets to be defined by the court. Do you disagree with O'Connor in the Lawerence case?\n \n The questions would certainly help if you wish to have a civil discussion about the constitution.",

   "All I am seeing in your post is a bunch of contradictions...\n\n And thus begins Steeeeve's misrepresentations.\n The funny thing is that I have explained this to him NUMEROUS times, but he keeps claiming that what HE THINKS I meant is what I really meant, instead of obviously ME KNOWING what I meant when I said it...\n \n \n \nmarriage is not a right from the 9th amendment before it was\n\n Misrepresentation #1.\n The 9th amendment establishes that rights exist that are not listed in the constitution. The founding fathers never intended the constitution to be a complete list of what our rights were, and acknowledged that there were rights that they did not talk about in the document.\n THAT is my position.\n Not what Steeeeve claims...\n \n \n \nIt existed outta no where and was just uncovered by a judge some how (I suppose they could say anything was a right if thats the standard).\n\n You could argue that.\n And somehow I suspect that these rights that you think \"they could say anything\" about would be a list of rights that you don't agree with...\n \n \n \nYou say you use the current legal precedent as your backing for what you say as if legal precdent is always right but then when someone quotes the 3 cases that upheld the ban you all of a sudden find this precedent to be incorrect.\n\n Legal rulings are not always right Steeeeve.\n Even you seem to get that...\n \n When I say that a precedent is incorrect, I EXPLICITLY EXPLAIN WHY I believe it to be incorrect.\n Instead of acknowledging that fact, you instead try to generalize...\n \n \n \nWhy can't you just give a straight answer about how the constitution guarntees a right to marriage for gay couples?\n\n Steeeeve, how many times do I have to give that answer before you REMEMBER it and stop misrepresenting it?\n It's fairly simple.\n 1) Marriage IS a right. Recognized as so by numerous court rulings.\n 2) The 14th amendment's equal protection requirement requires a LEGITIMATE STATE INTEREST before any form of marriage can be discriminated against.\n 3) There is no legitimate state interest against gay marriage.\n \n THREE simple points. NONE of these have changed over time.\n And I have explained these REPEATEDLY.\n And yet you claim I haven't given a straight answer???\n \n \n \nYou obviously believe it is beyond just an \"equal protection issue\" and that \"marriage\" is actually a right guarnteed by the constitution. If this is incorrect please say so ...\n\n And here we come to another delicious contradiction that Steeeeve represents.\n He claims that I haven't given him a \"straight answer\".\n But somehow he KNOWS the basis of my argument...\n emoticon_xdonno \n \n It's like claiming you don't know where the cookies went, when you've got cookie crumbs on your mouth...\n Regardless, what do you mean by \"obviously believe it is beyond just an \"equal protection issue\" \"???\n Let me guess.\n Another question I'll get no answer to?\n \n \n \n...but atleast answer me this ( I don't recal you answering it when I asked the first time) Can a state get rid of marriage all together?\n\n 1) Actually Steeeeve, this is the first time I've seen you answer this question.\n Can you show me where you have asked this question before???\n Or should I expect that this is yet another question you won't answer?\n \n 2) I honestly don't know what you mean by this question.\n Marriage is recognized on multiple levels. Both the state and the federal government have their marriage recognition legislation.\n So theoretically, without understanding fully what you mean by \"get rid of\", even if the state \"got rid of\" marriage, the federal marriage would still exist. Marriages performed in other states would still be required to be recognized by the federal constitution.\n \n 3) To formally get elaboration, what do you mean by \"get rid of\"?\n Describe the hypothetical mechanism you are talking about...\n \n \n \nFurthermore, explain how a judge discovers a right that exists due to the 9th amendment? What criteria is used!?\n\n Like I said, judges don't \"discover\" rights. They don't \"create\" rights.\n They acknowledge the existence of rights.\n It's like acknowledging that society likes celebrities. The observation isn't a \"creation\" of that, but rather just observing reality.\n \n \n \nYour round-a-bout answers will just not due anymore...give it to me straight for once.\n\n 1) I can't help it if you don't like my answers. You want me to say \"create\" in regards to judges acknowledging the existence of rights, and that's not my position. If I refuse to use your word to describe the situation, that isn't a \"round-a-bout\" answer.\n \n 2) You have NOOOOOO room to criticize here Steeeeve. I have asked you a variety of questions you have routinely avoided.\n For you to complain about me and \"round-a-bout answers\", while you AVOID COMPLETELY answering, is VERY hypocritical....\n \n \n \nFinally, explain why marriage gets to be defined by the court.\n \n AGAIN you prove my point.\n You repeatedly claim that I \"change\" my position, or I \"contradict\" myself, but time and time again you prove that it is YOU WHO CANNOT ACCURATELY PORTRAY my position.\n \n This is proven by you asking a question that I HAVE ALREADY ADDRESSED.\n 1) Marriage IS DEFINED BY THE LEGISLATURE.\n 2) If the legislature's definition puts up unconstitutional restrictions, the courts REMOVE THOSE RESTRICTIONS.\n But it is still the legislature that has the ultimate control.\n Even more so as the legislature could pass a constitutional amendment (Oooohhhh. Really? Why don't they try that???) that can make the courts stick to the legislated definition as \"constitutional\".\n \n \n \nDo you disagree with O'Connor in the Lawerence case?\n\n O'Connor in Lawrence case. You mean her singular \"concurrence\" vote...\n I assume you're referring to this gem.\n \"Unlike the moral disapproval of same-sex relations--the asserted state interest in this case--other reasons exist to promote the institution of marriage beyond mere moral disapproval of an excluded group.\"\n \n 1) I agree that \"moral disapproval of same-sex relations\" was the asserted state interest, and that it was invalid.\n 2) I agree that \"other reasons exist to promote the institution of marriage\".\n 3) I agree that \"reasons exist to promote the institution of marriage beyond mere moral disapproval of an excluded group\". The reasons promoting the institution of marriage include its positive effect on strengthening society.\n 4) I don't see any legitimate reasons for preventing gay marriage. If you have any, lay them out...\n \n 5) To ask a question that I expect will go on the pile of the avoided questions, do YOU agree with O'Connor in her concurrence?\n And not just here, but in her position in general?\n Or are you trying to pick out one spot that you agree with, and you disagree with most of her statements.\n \n \n \nThe questions would certainly help if you wish to have a civil discussion about the constitution.\n\n You recognizing MY ACTUAL RESPONSE would certainly help if you wish to have an civil discussion...",
