I can spend all my time futilely arguing with people whose mind's I won't change or I can go see what I can do in the world to help women, children, and even reduce abortion.\n\n I would not give up on this abortion forum completely. It may well have been temporarily hijacked by the lunatic fringe of the pro-life side, as opposed to its mainstream, but they will go away eventually if people ignore them. That is the very essence of the internet troll. They feed on attention while adding absolutely nothing useful or relevant to the debate apart from the extreme, lunatic fringe, opinions that only they themselves consider relevant and which even their own side generally keeps away from.\n \n From wikipedia \"An Internet troll, or simply troll in Internet slang, is someone who posts controversial, inflammatory, irrelevant or off-topic messages in an online community, such as an online discussion forum or chat room, with the primary intent of provoking other users into an emotional response or to generally disrupt normal on-topic discussion.\". The best strategy is usually not to feed them with the attention that they desire - unless, of course, you enjoy such discussions.\n \n I, and I suspect many or most others, am occasionally checking in both from pure entertainment value of watching such trolls engaged, and for the hope that, at some point, someone will start an intelligent thread that most of us can engage in while continuing to ignore any disruptive tendencies of the lunatic fringe...as I will ignore them. I personally think it is necessary to engage only mainstream pro-life views, where I have enjoyed and gained insight from discussions with pro-life posters such as Steeeeve and jyoshu. I personally see no use whatsoever of engaging the pro-life side's lunatic fringe - especially represented by Cyberateos. I personally feel quite sorry for Mexican women if his attitudes are the type of attitudes that they encounter in everyday life.

I don't think that is true. As long as a woman has her wits about her, she can get out of a bad situation before the point of no return. \n\n The issue of morality of responsible sexual behavior vs morality of abortion are actually two separate issues. You on the pro-life side seem to make it one issue. To address this, let me ask you: Would it matter to you in deciding abortion rights if a woman had an abortion who was in a good and stable marriage and happened to have a condom break vs a woman having an abortion because she wanted to have unprotected sex with ten men a night? It seems that you on the pro-life side would be against abortion no matter what her sexual practices might be. The only exceptions you generally make is if it were not her choice - ex. rape and incest - or if the pregnancy could lead to her death. So for you, consensual sex automatically means that a woman is responsible to take the pregnancy to term. This seems to be true in the pro-life case since, no matter what consensual sex she practices, responsible or irresponsible, it is your abhorence of abortion that makes you think that abortion is not a responsible solution to an unwanted pregnancy and that the only options are (1) carry the pregnancy to term or (2) avoid it by abstaining from sex. \n \n We on the pro-choice side do not make that automatic connection since we don't view a woman having consentual sex as automatically taking on the responsibility of taking the pregnancy to term. This is because we view at least early term abortions as an acceptable answer to unwanted pregnancies. So, the woman has more options: (1) carry the pregnancy to term, (2) avoid it by abstaining from sex or avoid it as best you can through contraception and (3) if you do get pregnant, you can still abort in early trimesters. Our acceptance of abortion as an option is why there isn't an automatic assumption that consensual sex = acceptance of responsibility for carrying the fetus to term. Many of us, myself included, would think poorly of a woman who does not take precautions against unwanted pregnancies but, once again, this is a separate moral judgment than the moral judgment of whether or not she should be able to get an abortion. \n \n So, as long as you remain unconvincing in your arguements against early term abortions, then you will remain unconvincing in your arguement that agreement to sex means agreement to any resulting pregnancy. In our view, early term abortion is an acceptable answer to unwanted pregnancies, no matter how much we might disrespect a woman who got into that unwanted pregnancy through irresponsible actions.",

There are large numbers of people who are pro-choice who are Christian and I don't mean only pro-choice in allowing others the choice of abortion. I mean pro-choice in that they would themselves practice abortion. Indeed, I know a few Christians who have had abortions. These were not generally evangelical, fundamentalist or very strongly practicing Christians - they only occasionally went to mass or service - but that does not exclude them from being counted as Christian. There are wide ranges of religious beliefs and wide overlapping ranges of views on abortion. The trouble with anecdotal examples is that they generally come from people who are like you, so you get a skewed view of reality since you would be far less likely to know personal examples from people who are not like you.\n \nBut I cannot speak for 'non-Christian' couples, however, since you gave as your example a 'condom break', you should also know that 'responsible' sex dictates one understand the limitations of the birth control they are practicing.

That's why we use only one.\n\n The abortion industry has very little influence on the views of pro-choice supporters. Abortion has been around, in one way or another, for millenia for the very basic reason that women occasionally find themselves with unwanted pregnancies in situations desperate or important enough that they go through various methods of stopping that pregnancy. Nobody needs to convince them of that need.\n \n However, you do have a point that the existence of the abortion option might leave people with some excuse or lack of enthusiasm for fully practicing responsible sex. As a pro-choice supporter, I certainly would not condone making abortion illegal in order to promote more responsible sex. I will admit, though, that I find the abortion debate far more compelling than the sex education debate - mainly since I find it so important for women to have that safety net of options and reproductive freedoms if they do find themselves with an unwanted pregnancy. So I, along with many on the pro-choice side, do not put as much of our energies as we perhaps should into pushing for more reponsible sex to begin with.\n \n I think this is one area where our two sides actually agree in the general idea that it would be good to reduce the number of abortions by reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies. Imagine what could be accomplished if our sides actually worked together in this direction. I think that the devil is in the details, though, in how each of our sides would work to achieve this. I, along with many on the pro-choice side, think that education on responsible sex needs to happen in the schools - when students are still in a learning mode, and where one can force them to listen to the methods of proper contraception use. If one does not teach people about responsible sex in school, then one may never have another opportunity - so that many people start their sexual lives with neither school nor parents to influence them in practicing safe sex. Unfortunately, many on the pro-life side don't believe in teaching students about safe-sex practices since they view that it is a message to them that it is OK to practice pre-marital sex. Therefore, they only want to teach abstinence. I can understand the concern of sending unintended messages but I think that the consequences of not teaching them safe sex are worse, given the reality of American culture. Large numbers of students will just roll their eyes at such teaching and continue having sex anyway though, now, without the benefit of having learned how to practice it safely. ... Actually, before you respond to this point, I think this might be worth a thread of its own since it is an important topic that the general abortion forum could participate in. I will start one (and excuse the repetitiveness of using much of this paragraph in that thread)...",
