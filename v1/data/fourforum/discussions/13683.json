   "By The Associated Press\n 12.07.2009 11:09am EST\n \n (Washington) The Supreme Court said Monday it will decide whether a California law school must force a Christian group to admit gays, lesbians and nonbelievers to gain stature as an official campus organization.\n \n The high court agreed to hear an appeal from a chapter of the Christian Legal Society at the University of California's Hastings College of the Law. A federal judge had turned aside the group's attempt to force the school to give it campus funding and other benefits without opening its membership to gays, lesbians and nonbelievers - a requirement of the San Francisco school.\n \n The 30-member Hastings group was told in 2004 that it was being denied recognition, including university funding and benefits, because of its policy of exclusion.\n \n Federal courts have rejected the group's assertions that the law school's policy violated its freedoms of speech, religion and association.\n \n According to a society news release, it invites all students to its meetings.\n \n \"However, CLS voting members and officers must affirm its Statement of Faith,\" the statement said. \"CLS interprets the Statement of Faith to include the belief that Christians should not engage in sexual conduct outside of a marriage between a man and a woman.\"\n \n The Christian Legal Society has more than 100 chapters at universities nationwide. The group has sued other universities on the same grounds.\n \n It won at Southern Illinois University, whether the unversity settled with the group in 2007 and recognized its membership and leadership policies.\n \n The case is Christian Legal Society v. Martinez, 08-1371.",

   "sigh, the incoherent philosophy of identity politics rears its ugly head yet again.\n \n To summarise, Jazy, you are sure this discrimination should be punished, but your thoughts about why it should be punished are all jumbled up. A variety of explanations come to mind, but none of them are entirely suitable for the cause, with the net result of aiming to get a consensus on the conclusions without going through the logic behind them.\n \n 1) The fascist interpretation: The government should outlaw any and all discriminatory behaviour. Simple, but the broader implications of this trouble you, and there's also a high risk of the \"gay rights\" movement being viewed as totalitarianism in the closet.\n \n 2) The \"conservative\" interpretation: The university, as a private entity, can fund or defund who it wants, and therefore has a right to discriminate against this club. Good because this argument may appeal to conservatives; bad because it raises the spectre of \"Texas Christian Tech\" blocking XXXXX friendly clubs and you being obligated to agree. (good to see this board blocks the word qweer, since it is offensive to so many)\n \n 3) The liberal (weasel fascist) interpretation: People can do what they want, generally speaking, but since the university takes public funds in one form or another, or can otherwise, like say a private restaurant, be classified as a \"public\" space, it is obligated to uphold non-discrimination as a general principle. This is effectively the same as 1) but has the surface appearance of being more reasonable to people who don't realise the government's tentacles stretch through virtually everything in america.\n \n 4) The libertarian interpretation; the government should not be funding universities. Public funding creates public goods dilemmas that cannot be rationally resolved, only dealt with by political power (violence) or an uneasy compromise. This is not a solution to be considered because at some point the mainstream gay rights movement decided the solution to all problems was more government. Articulating this solution would also alienate the general college-left protest crowd, who are a core pillar of support for gay rights in general.",

   "By The Associated Press\n 12.07.2009 11:09am EST\n \n (Washington) The Supreme Court said Monday it will decide whether a California law school must force a Christian group to admit gays, lesbians and nonbelievers to gain stature as an official campus organization.\n \n The high court agreed to hear an appeal from a chapter of the Christian Legal Society at the University of California's Hastings College of the Law. A federal judge had turned aside the group's attempt to force the school to give it campus funding and other benefits without opening its membership to gays, lesbians and nonbelievers - a requirement of the San Francisco school.\n \n The 30-member Hastings group was told in 2004 that it was being denied recognition, including university funding and benefits, because of its policy of exclusion.\n \n Federal courts have rejected the group's assertions that the law school's policy violated its freedoms of speech, religion and association.\n \n According to a society news release, it invites all students to its meetings.\n \n \"However, CLS voting members and officers must affirm its Statement of Faith,\" the statement said. \"CLS interprets the Statement of Faith to include the belief that Christians should not engage in sexual conduct outside of a marriage between a man and a woman.\"\n \n The Christian Legal Society has more than 100 chapters at universities nationwide. The group has sued other universities on the same grounds.\n \n It won at Southern Illinois University, whether the unversity settled with the group in 2007 and recognized its membership and leadership policies.\n \n The case is Christian Legal Society v. Martinez, 08-1371.\n\n \n Here is a different way to look at this. \n \n CLS does not agree with a homosexual lifestyle. They may attend meetings, but may not hold office within the group. Nobody is preventing them from organizing the group and accepting members privately. No one is preventing them from financing themselves or accepting donations or charging membership fees. They feel that it is within their rights to prohibit a specific segment of society from office due to their sexual orientation. They feel it is their right to be given money to do this from funds that include money from the group that they exclude. Public funds come from the public. Same sex, black, Asian, Jewish, Hindu, christian, white, male, female, straight, handicapped etc and that is why groups who want to exclude certain individuals don't get public funding.\n \n Secondly for you Christians who think they are being treated unfairly, consider that Hastings has several groups that cater to specific people. There is one for homosexuals, for Jewish students, latin students and so on. If a Christian would like to be a member of one of these groups he will not have to state his acceptance of same sex marriage or renounce Jesus. Theses minority groups are practicing tolerance by their willingness to accept those who may hold views contrary to the groups. The Christians feel they should be given special treatment and allowed to exclude anyone who doesn't accept their view. \n \n All the CLS need do is state that not affirming the belief that marriage is between a man and a woman does not prohibit membership or holding office within the group and there is no longer an issue. \n \n You say that the homosexual is being a victim here, but it is the Christian who wants to have the benefits of public money but retain the right to not benefit the public. They further feel that this is so unjust and unfair that they sued for this and lost, sued again thru an appeal and lost and still felt wronged enough to appeal to the Supreme Court, but the homosexuals are the whiny victims complaining for no reason. \n \n What ya say, wanna reevaluate your position on this?",

   "If gays don't like the 3,000+ year old prohibitions in the Bible against gay sex / marriage and the denominations that honor those prohibitions, then gays need to leave those churches and people alone and start their own religions. But to go storming in to various churches demanding they abrogate God-given principles just so they can be politically correct is absolutely wrong.\n\n \n There is nothing political nor correct in your evaluations Easy. This is not a matter of storming into one's said place of worship and demanding acceptance. Such a thing is ludicrous and I would condemn such an action it it were true...\n \n What is the issue here is that according to your ideals, we should re institute the 3000 year old prohibitions such as slavery, stoning, and forbidding the handling of pigskin and abomination of eating shellfish..\n \n I love how fundamentalists often cite one passage out of context and choose to ignore all points of the laws of Moses including divorce...\n \n If what you say is true and based upon your ranting and clear ignorance (btw there is NO passage in the bible that deals with homosexuals marrying) then instead of taking from column A and inserting into column B as you choose to do, why not re institute the entire law of Moses?\n \n I have an answer to that as well... Firstly, the context in which the law was written was shaped around the times and the situation the Isrealite's faced as a fledgling nation beset of enemies..\n \n Such law fit the time period and the understanding by which they thought all life was contained in the male sperm. Such was law written around, and such was that the law ensured the population and the tribe itself would endure...\n \n And once again. Do you deny that the law was written forbiding homosexuality in only the context you present it? Or do you accept the confirmed evidence that such worship was performed by other nations in particular those of Israel's enemies, as a means to ensure crop growth and fertility?\n \n Look it up! You will see that the context in which the Law was written was for it's time and in their understanding...",

   "It's about a lot more than sex. Do gays want to marry or have a relationship blessing in their church, because they only care about the sex? You don't need any of that to have great sex. Naturally some people want to think we're all about sex. This makes us not fully human in their eyes and easier to hate.\n \n They can then say, all gays need to do is choose a different type of sex. Then, they can be just like me and I won't have a problem.\n\n \n You tend to ignore the sexual part of homosexuality when it suits you .\n If one was to live with and love someone of their own sex without any sexual relationship whatsoever then the relationship could not be percieved as homosexual.",
