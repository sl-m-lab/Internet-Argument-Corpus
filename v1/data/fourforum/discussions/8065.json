   "Georgian high-ranking officials are in control of drugs traffic from Central Asia to Europe. By Saakashvili's order the chairman of the parliamentary Committee for Defence and Security Targamadze and Interior Minister Merabishvili are controlling all drugs traffic in Georgia then by a complicated scheme they lauder the drug money and invest them into construction business of Targamadze's 'Sinkle Group' company. \n It's well-known that Targamadze controls over 50% of construction business in Tbilisi and now hotel Iveria reconstruction is his main project. By dummies he drew up the hotel as property of 'Silk Road Group' (this is part of 'Sinkle Group' concern) which oficially is working over hotel's reconstruction. The financial recourses are coming from Kazakh 'Bank TuranAlem'. 'Silk Road Group' signed a treaty with 'Rezidor SAS' about new Iveria management. Well, by this complicated scheme Georgian official Targamadze is trying to launder the drugs money. In corrupt Georgia most part this business is connected with Targamadze and Merabishvili.",
