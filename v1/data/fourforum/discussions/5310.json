Does anyone know how this is done. In MS Publisher, you can insert a hyperlink, and it will add a subject line but not the message body. \n \n This would be a handy tool in my new job as a community prganizer for mental health. I could ask people to email their legislator with a message I have written for them.\n \n I can send you the orginal email I got if you would like an example. Just PM me your email!",

Just PM me your email!\n\n \n Can't tell you how to do that, and many people don't use ISP based email for obvious reasons, but most legislators with any clout have turned to using script in their websites, no direct email addresses. Best thing you can offer is a link to their page where your supporters complete the response form. A friend said they switched to script because they were being inundated by special interest groups with form email on popular issues.",

Most don't even have web pages. We are the smallest state. We have only 75 reps and 38 senators in the state. Most towns only have one or two reps. and a senator. Small stuff, but fun!\n \n I did find a program online that will create the needed code, but it only allows one paragraph in the body, it appears not to be able to create \"hard returns' in the body of the email. I am using it to have people cc me on what gets set, so I can track which senators to target.",
