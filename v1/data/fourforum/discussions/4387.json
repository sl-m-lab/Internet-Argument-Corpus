   "Perhaps he should invest in a government. \"Secular = non-religious\". The fact that the government happens to be (ideally) non-religious does not mean that secularism is defined as the government.\n \n Break down his logic where secular=A, non-religious=B, and government=C. You will get \"A = B, and B is an attribute of C, therefore A=C\". Which is stupid since, by this logic, if \"mighty\" is a synonym for \"powerful\", and \"powerful\" is an attribute of a 2005 Corvette, then the word \"mighty\" means \"Corvette\".\n \n For any of you who has the slightest incling of a brain you can understand this and see why it shows the utter stupidity of daewoo and his posse.\n \n \n Logically, this  Since 99.999% of all secular schools receive funding from Uncle Sam, It's a safe assumption to say secular = governmental controlled.\n \n is a retarded statement, since it is purpously designed to attack my statement that I prefer secular private schools over religious ones.\n \n HIs idea is that Secular Private Schools = Government, and government is untrusthworthy, therefore, Secular private schools suffer from the same.\n \n  Dictionary \n \n your friend needs a better dictionary.\n \n merriam webster wrote:\n Main Entry: 1sec\u00b7u\u00b7lar\n Pronunciation: 'se-ky&-l&r\n Function: adjective\n Etymology: Middle English, from Old French seculer, from Late Latin saecularis, from saeculum the present world, from Latin, generation, age, century, world; akin to Welsh hoedl lifetime\n 1 a : of or relating to the worldly or temporal <secular concerns< b : not overtly or specifically religious <secular music< c : not ecclesiastical or clerical <secular courts< <secular landowners<\n 2 : not bound by monastic vows or rules; specifically : of, relating to, or forming clergy not belonging to a religious order or congregation <a secular priest<\n 3 a : occurring once in an age or a century b : existing or continuing through ages or centuries c : of or relating to a long term of indefinite duration\n \n \n nothing about secular institutions automatically being government institutions.\n \n Again, Your Concession is accepted when you learn to read and make a logical argument.\n \n Nope: It's not logical to assume secular = government, when dealing with private schools. Daewoo is a fool if he thinks so.\n \n \n According to his logic, since the government controlled media and organizations are secular, and that secular = government, secular music is synonomous with government music.",

   "I didn't even make that statement. JPSartre did.\n \n My argument was that it was being misinterpeted, and rather OBVIOSLY so. \n \n Rather then establishing a cohesive argument, socialist has chosen to deliberatly misinterpet Jps comment and debate frivolous questions regarding his chosen terminology. It is childish and a rather pathetic manner of waging a debate.\n \n Personally, I am done feeding the troll. I have better things to do that argue with those who are unable to form a cohesive point.",
