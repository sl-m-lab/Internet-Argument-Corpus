   "Only by a truly international effort can the Israeli crisis in the Middle East be resolved once and for all. It will be the United States and Israel verses the community of nations of the world with a very few exceptions. The platform and manner that the difference between the parties can be resolved will be up to the United States and Israel. Basically they have two choices with the first being they continue to dictate term and conditions that will eventually led to more wars and military conflicts as it has for the last sixty years. Or two we can change course drastically opening the whole crisis before an International Tribunal that will dictate terms and condition on matters that have not already been resolved by the parties of concern The International Tribunal ruling will have to be imposed onto the parties of concern.\n \n The latter of the two choices will require at least a twenty year twelve-step program to peace and security. With the United Nations, League of Arab Nations, NATO, European Union and the NGO's of humanity coming together for a twenty year mission. Israel and the United States will be called before the International Tribunal as well as any other nations or people involved war crimes related to this crisis. Each side will have a chance to present their case with the International Tribunal making the final ruling which is a ruling of a settlement more than punishment. \n \n Any military aggressive action taken by any of the parties involved after the International Peacekeepers have entered the region will be judged much more harshly than war crimes committed in the past. \n \n \u00b7 Stop the fighting\n \u00b7 Move in International Peacekeepers\n \u00b7 Set-up the Peace table for long term negations\n \u00b7 Set-up long term international relief efforts\n \u00b7 Set up the International Tribunal \n \u00b7 Resolve the agreeable difference outside the International Tribunal\n \u00b7 International Tribunal gives ruling on unsettled matters\n \u00b7 Enforcement of International Tribunal rulings\n \u00b7 The monitoring of the situation on the ground\n \u00b7 Fine tuning of any problems\n \u00b7 The dismembering of the International Tribunal\n \u00b7 A world wide celebration for peace",

   "ok buddy, \n lets go through just the first step of your 'perfect' 12 step process...realistically. \n first, how are you going to get BOTH sides to stop the fighting? and i am assuming that you do require both sides to stop firing before peace can be achieved. you have one side that is kidnapping soldiers, bombing falafel stands, and firing rockets at residential areas. and the other is bombing out a major city to rid the world of a terrorist organization. \n \n being as though nobody here seems to believe in objective realities, lets say that both sides are right.\n \n both sides have purposes behind their attacks. both sides believe that they are each doing what they need to do to survive. they both also believe that the existence of the other cannot be, for it endangers their very lives. \n \n so, what do you tell them? \"just stop fighting\" ? or should you say \"its really not worth fighting for, we can all really just get along\" ? what do you suppose this 'international peacekeeping force' says to both sides to make them stop? and why would they listen to an outside source to tell them what is really best for them?\n \n furthermore what is an 'international peacekeeping force'? to me it seems like a bigger army of people who will beat up anybody who breaks the peace. that seems sure peaceful to me. second about this wonder warrior force of yours. why would anybody from another country care enough to put his or her life on the line to keep peace in a foreign country. i know we are all idealists and want world peace. but, when your life is on the line, and you need to step into a life and death situation, who will act and who will idly stand by.",

   "Any idea of the size of Lebanon's military and costs? Or their stance on the Israeli invasion?\n\n \n According to several sources, Iran funds Hezbollah to the tune of $100 - 250Million/year.\n http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=51195 $250Million \n \n\n Iran is believed to fund Hezbollah to the tune of at least $100 million per year. Recently, Western diplomats and analysts in Lebanon estimated Hezbollah receives closer to $200 million a year from Iran. (10) The increase is likely due to Iran's keen interest in undermining prospects for Israeli-Palestinian peace (and, in general, further destabilizing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict), and Hezbollah's growing role as Iran's proxy to achieve this goal. Hezbollah success in funding and training Palestinian groups-not just the Iran's interest in it-may well explain the increase in funding since Iran is known to employ a results-oriented approach to determining the level of funding it is willing to provide terrorist groups. As a U.S. court noted in Weinstein v. Iran, the period of 1995-1996 \"was a peak period for Iranian economic support of Hamas because Iran typically paid for results, and Hamas was providing results by committing numerous bus bombings such as the one on February 25, 1996.\" (11) Iranian funding to terrorist groups like Hamas and Islamic Jihad (most often funneled via Hezbollah) increases when they carry out successful attacks and decreases when they fail, are thwarted or are postponed due to ceasefires or other political considerations. \n \n Some of this financial support comes in the form of cash funds, while much is believed to come in the form of material goods such as weapons. Iranian cargo planes deliver sophisticated weaponry, from rockets to small arms, to Hezbollah in regular flights to Damascus from Tehran. These weapons are offloaded in Syria and trucked to Hezbollah camps in Lebanon's Beka'a Valley. In the wake of the death of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Hezbollah reportedly received an additional $22 million from Iranian intelligence to support Palestinian terrorist groups and foment instability.

   "I'd personally cap Bin Laden. I'm speaking as an American who was attacked by him, not as a citizen of any of several ME nations who suffered and suffers oppression and death due to US and Israeli policies.\n\n so you would only knock off bin laden because he personally attacked you? not because he did anything wrong per se, just because it had to do with you. and i dont understand how the second part of your sentence fits with the first. first you say that you would kill bin laden and then you say something about people who are oppressed by the US and Israel. please explain.\n \n \nIn this instance Hermann Goering's famous statement at Nuremberg regarding leadership and war is very applicable.\n\n I'm assuming you are speaking about the quote \"the people dont want war, but the governments do all the work\" something along those lines. and again i ask you. how do you know that the people dont want war?? i'm telling you, that i am here and i see them, and how they act, and trust me they want war. it is the reason they live. they believe that their sole purpose in life is to kill or convert every single last human being. why are you so determinded to say that they are really peace keeping people, when they wholeheartedly support and celebrate the death of every westerner and israeli. you are so bent on the fact that everyone at heart is a nice, loving peacekeeping, flowery, flowing, fluffy, loveable person who just wants a loving world. you are so wrong about these people. \n even if you say that the government is the one making the war, why is it that there are celebrations in the street for every attack taken out on israel, and especially 9/11? are you telling me that the government makes them do that also? \n you dont understand this mentality because you yourself probably arent this objective about the world. they believe that no matter what anybody says, they are right, and that the world will become muslim, either from conversion and/or everybody else being killed.\n again i recommend the documentary:\n www.obsessionthefilm.com",

   "and just in case there is any doubt in anybody's mind as to whether he lebanese government supports hezbollah or not. the lebanese PM came out today (sunday), and publicly thanked hezbollah.\n \n \nLebanese PM Thanks Hizbullah\n 18:25 Jul 30, '06 / 5 Av 5766\n \n (IsraelNN.com) Lebanese Prime Minister Fuad Sniora thanked Hizbullah Sunday for its \"sacrifices\" in its war against Israel. \"We thank the chairman of Hizbullah for his efforts,\" he said, referring to Hizbullah leader Hassan Nasrallah. \"I want to thank all those who sacrificed their lives for our independence and sovereignty in Lebanon.\"\n \n Lebanon is a key factor in a proposed cease fire because it is being called on to dismantle Hizbullah terrorists, as decided in a United Nations resolution.\n\n \n now how on earth are we going to dismantle hezbollah using the lebanese govenment, when they themselves support hezbollah.",
