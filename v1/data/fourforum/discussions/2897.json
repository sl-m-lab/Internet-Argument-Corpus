There is no crime, thus no exuse to collect evidence. Citizens are also protected by giving any evidence against thier will by the 5th Amendment.

   "That crime fighting tool senario you just described is REALLY REALLY spooky.\n\n \n Ballistic fingerprinting is, like most \"gun control\" a measure that is full of unintended consequences.\n \n \nIn our system of justice, collection of evidence is PROHIBITED by the 4th Amendment without probable cause. There is no crime, thus no exuse to collect evidence.\n \n \n In theory true but it gets convoluted when the discussion focuses on information that is freely offered by a citizen that seems innocuous but is actually incriminating under certain situations. EZ-Pass could be used to issue speeding tickets; the authorities know the minimum time it should take to travel between exits . . . You do it in a shorter time and you are issued a ticket. You have provided the authorities the evidence of your criminality and the means to prove it - but is that self-incrimination? \n \n \nCitizens are also protected by giving any evidence against thier will by the 5th Amendment.\n \n \n Gun registration schemes have been disabled for criminals because requiring them to register a gun they are forbidden to own would violate their 5th Amendment rights. I would assume that if ballistic fingerprinting ever became law, a form would be offered at time of sale where you would be required to waive any claim of 5th Amendment right injury from any governmental authority's use of the ballistic data. \n \n Don't sign the form - you don't get the gun.\n \n \nThis collected evidence will be used against suspects without thier permission. The crime fighting tool you just described violates 2 rights in one sweep. That is a very scary power given to police.\n\n \n Maryland already has the law on the books.

   "Well, I am a prosecutor in Virginia. I have a lot of experience in dealing with ballistics evidence. I don't personally have a problem with creating a mandatory ballistic fingerprinting (MBF) database, but from my experience, I do not believe that it's extremely limited use can be justified for its cost. \n \n Constitutional barriers: \n \n First of all, let me state that the 4th. and 5th. Amendments will pose NO BARRIER to a nationwide MBF database scheme like we already see in N.Y. and Md. (The reasons for this are too lengthy to explain here. I can give you the reasons why in another post if anyone is interested.)\n \n Distortion by Filing:\n \n When the concept of creating a state or nation-wide MBF database first arose, I talked to a couple of experts I deal with at our Division of Forensic Science (we call them \"tool mark\" experts). They agree that a criminal can quickly take a file to a gun and distort it beyond their ability to compare with the \"fingerprints\" it has already left on crime scene rounds and casings. Based upon my experience, however, I do not believe that we would have a rash of criminals who would take a file to their barrels the night after their crimes. The reason is this: They already know we can make ballistic comparisons to weapons we recover, and yet these knuckleheads almost always keep their gun after they kill somebody with it and do nothing to try to alter it after the crime. TV dramas notwithstanding, few if any criminals are calculating enough to think to alter the \"fingerprint\" signature of their weapon after they whack somebody with it (I've been in the business 11 years now. I have handled many, many shooting cases, and I have never seen anyone attempt to alter their gun after the crime). \n \n Having said this, however, here's why I don't think the program can be justified. There are only two scenarios I deal with in ballistic fingerprinting. Cases in which a firearm is recovered and can be tested against the shells/rounds found at the crime scene, and cases in which no gun can be found to test. (We actually find the gun used in the crime more often than not) \n \n For cases involving a recovered gun to test, there is zero need for a MBF database. The gun is typically found soon after the crime, and in any event very few, if any, more rounds have been fired from it since it fired the rounds used in the crime. A new test firing performed by our lab would produce a far more accurate comparison to use than a round test-fired potentially years and hundreds if not thousands of rounds earlier when the weapon was manufactured. Additionally, if a MBF database scheme were ever enacted, then I know that prosecutors like myself would ignore it in cases involving a recovered firearm. We simply have a much easier chain of custody issue for the admission of our link evidence by using the new test-firing from our lab. I would rather not have to get involved in subpoenaing witnesses and authenticating documents from a manufacturer in another state if I can avoid it. \n \n For cases where no gun was recovered to test, the additional assistance we could obtain from MBF is still very minimal. Assuming that we could use a MBF database to match a cartridge casing or round from a crime scene to a particular gun, that proves nothing unless you can also trace the gun and put it into your suspect's hand, which in reality is a difficult process. Here is how gun traces currently work: A gun is recovered (from a tip that says we can find it in the bottom of a farm pond, for example). It is identified by manufacturer, model #, caliber, and serial #. Assume that we match the recovered weapon to a crime by ballistics (this is where we would start if we matched it by a MBF database instead of a recovered gun). The next step is to request an ATF trace on the weapon. ATF contacts the manufacturer, who is required to maintain records for each firearm made. Those records tell us the date of manufacture, the FFL dealer the weapon was shipped to, and the date it was shipped. ATF then obtains the sale records which every FFL dealer is required to maintain for every firearm and learns when the gun was received by the dealer and when and to whom the particular gun was sold. This info is passed to our sheriff's dept., which then attempts to track down the original purchaser. In those very rare cases where the original purchaser is also the suspect in the crime, then the MBF database may help provide another circumstantial link (Ladies and Gentleman, a year ago, our defendant bought the very gun used in this crime from Raymond's Gun Shop---last year we had this very scenario in a cop killing). It is, however, exceedingly rare that we ever find cases like this--where a crime is committed by the actual original purchaser of the weapon. In the majority of cases we now trace we discover that the original owner sold the gun to someone we can no longer identify, or the weapon was stolen, or some other untraceable transfer happens between the original purchase and the crime. A MBF database is worthless in these cases. The only way the MBF database can realistically work (assuming that the operational hurdles of such a database can be overcome) is if you combine it with both an effectively updated universal registration scheme for all guns and gun owners, and an effective mandatory record keeping scheme for all secondary transfers of firearms by private individuals. Now I have both defended and prosecuted a boatload of people who use guns in crimes. Many of them were already convicted felons when they used their gun in a crime, and I can tell you that none of them would even remotely consider complying with either a universal registration or recorded secondary transfer scheme. The inevitable large scale passive resistance to a registration and private transfer recording scheme would render the programs worthless.\n \n Here is the final problem I have with the rosy picture of crime reduction through a MBF database. In return for the very few cases we could solve we would absorb an enormous cost, both in money and in already limited manpower. We are already swamped by the sheer number of forensic evidence cases we deal with now. Take DNA, for example. The current DNA testing backlog in Virginia is 6 months (before I can get test results), which happens to be one month longer than my speedy trial clock for people who are denied bond and held in custody pending trial because of the seriousness of their crimes (like rape/robbery/murder). I am routinely faced with the prospect of having to let people out of jail while I await DNA results. The cause, quite frankly, is a lack of political will to expend the necessary money to hire more scientists and expand testing facilities to clear the backlog. A similar problem exists in every existing forensic science field (ballistics, other tool marks, handwriting, fingerprinting, etc.). Now if everyone who wishes to see a MBF database is also willing to considerably raise their taxes to pay for the necessary expansion of the state's ability to conduct forensic testing in these other fields in addition to assuming the large cost of creating, maintaining, and working a MBF database, then fine. But until we are all ready to do so, I would rather have the limited money we do have available put to use helping my scientists conduct the tests that I already know yield tangible results far more frequently than what can reasonably be suggested by the creation of a MBF database.",

   "Speaking as a professional armorer and weapons expert, I can tell you that the Ballistic Fingerprint Database won't work. \n \n The DOJ in California did a test on the technology applied to the idea. A test round fired cannot be matched to another test round from the same gun after 50 rounds have been shot 90% of the time. \n \n I don't know if anyone here realized the implication of this but I'll try to explain it. If a database system was to be installed, and I buy a gun that has been test fired for the database, after 50 rounds on the range, there is a 90% chance that there will be no match. \n \n After 200 rounds, only general similarities can be detected leaving a 100% chance of failure to meet exacting matches. Hence, it cannot be used in court or otherwise. \n \n Combine this with the cost of the system for low results the system just simply won't work and it's nothing more than pork barrel spending. Maryland has the fingerprint database and to date, no crimes have been solved and no evidence has come from the system. Yet look at the cost of the database.\n \n In Virginia, less than intelligent people attempted to ram rod it down our throats. I traveled to Richmond and spoke before the Militia and Police Committee. We were able to get the committee to see the futility of the idea and the bill was voted down. It has been ever since as well. \n \n As a Virginian, I prefer the state to not waste my tax money on a system that is a complete failure. \n \n Mike",
