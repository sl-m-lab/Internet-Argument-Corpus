But, let me explain further. \n IF $$bills ever said \"In Satan We Trust\", we would have alot more to worry about than internet service, grocery shopping, or paying the rent.\n\n \n Why do we have more to worry about than paying the rent just because of the wording on the dollar bill? It is just like saying we have more to worry about than paying the bills because it says God on the dollar bill. It doesn't make any sense.\n \n So lets just ignore whatever it is your trying to state here. Would you use money if it stated a pledge to Satan on it if your biggest concern was paying the rent?\n \n \nWhat do you think?\n\n \n I think exactly what I implied that I think. It doesn't matter what is stated on money. It will be trivial because money is required to survive and maintain your way of life. I could have a picture of Satan killing God on a dollar bill, drop it on the floor in a church, and inevitably someone will pick it up and put it in their pocket even if they are offended by it. That is what I think.\n \n \nFor Christians, the bible, the 10 commandments, and God are their way of life.\n There are many Christians who have given up more than material things- even their lives, to defend the Word of God.\n\n \n Would they give up all material things? That is what you are asking when you say these people shouldn't use money because it has the word God on it.

I doubt you would either.\n \n \nWhy should Christians give in to the whims of a group of people who place no value on their eternal lives?\n\n \n They wouldn't be giving in to anything. If they treat the money as a means to survive and not use it's writings as a way to live by then who exactly are they giving in to? Life for them would continue as normal and essentially nothing would be different.\n \n \nIf they believe this issue is worth defending to the death, then let them.

If we do take down crosses, what of places like Pearl Harbor or Arlington National Cemetery? \n \n Terral's reply << First off, let's look at exactly what the first amendment of our Bill of Rights actually says:\n \n Bill of Rights -Amendment I-\n \n \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.\" \n \n Terral continues << While congress has no right to establish any religion (which they have not done) they also are forbidden from prohibiting the free exercise of the same. Nor are they allowed to abridge the freedom of speech in any way. Therefore, Christians have every right under our constitution to exercise our freedom of expression pertaining to our faith, just as anyone else. If anyone is offended, then they can read another article or turn the channel. The government is not buildings and inanimate objects. The government is and has been 'We The People.\" \n \n The value system that has been present in the USA for the past 200+ years is based upon Judeo/Christian values, which are taught in our Bible. Those from the left wing in our country are polarizing themselves into faction groups dedicated to the overthrow our freedom of expression, and particularly freedom of expression regarding anything Christian. The fact that the majority of Americans are professing Christians means nothing to them. \n \n The symbols of \"In God We Trust,\" the \"Ten Commandments,\" the \"Cross\", (etc) are part of our American heritage passed down from our forefathers, as they saw fit to exercise their religious freedom of expression. A servant of the people has every right to adorn his or her environment according to their own beliefs. If those things do not sit well with the majority of the people in his/her OWN CONSTITUENCY, then THEY (the people) have every right to vote them out of office. But again, the GOVERNMENT itself (specifically congress) \"shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or PROHIBITING THE FREE EXERCISE THEREOF\" . . . PERIOD.\n \n We should not allow the belief system of unbelievers to rule over us. While I fully support the unbelievers right to gripe and complain over our religious freedoms, Christians everywhere also have the right to stand up for our freedoms and convictions. That rule applies whether we are standing on the street corner or representing the people in public office. \n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",

All of these things take place within creation over billions and billions of years from our perspective. Therefore, if we could look beyond the veil of time and space to actually see God Almighty, then all we would see is His stare; as if God had His picture taken. It is through \"His eternal power and divine nature\" (Rom. 1:20) that He can 'dwell in' His Three Witnesses.\"\n\n \n So the Father, Son and Holy Spirit represent the Vehicle of Expression through which our Creator manifests Himself inside this bubble we know as the universe. It is not that our Creator 'is' the Lord God who formed Adam, or the One to make a covenant with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. The Lord God of Gen. 2 - Malachi 4 is none other than our Lord Jesus Christ. Our Creator, from outside the realm of time and space, dwells 'in' Christ. Christ is His Word (John 1:1-3) made flesh. Christ is, \n \n \n\"the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation. For by Him all things were created, {both} in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities--all things have been created through Him and for Him. He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together.\" Col. 1:15-17. \n \n \n Of our Creator, it is written, \"that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and He has committed to us the word of reconciliation.\" 2Cor. 5:19. \n \n If you followed my directions on drawing two circles that overlap, from the above post, then visualizing how this works will be made easier. Again, draw the same two overlapping circles on a piece of paper. In the left hand part write the name Creator. In the right hand part, write the name Creation. In the central 'begotten' position (where the two overlap) write Christ/His Word. To get back into the infinite realm of the Almighty, we must first be baptized into the Body of Christ. Every single thing in creation that is redeemable/reconcilable to God Almighty shall be brought into subjection to His Son. Christ (the Lord God) must rule, until all the enemies of God are burned beyond the boundaries of that growing central section.\n \n \n\"For He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet. The last enemy that will be abolished is death. For HE HAS PUT ALL THINGS IN SUBJECTION UNDER HIS FEET. But when He says, \"All things are put in subjection,\" it is evident that He [Our Creator] is excepted who put all things in subjection to Him [Christ/Word/Son]. When all things are subjected to Him [His Word/Son], then the Son Himself also will be subjected to the One who subjected all things to Him, so that God may be all in all.\" 1Cor. 15:25-28.\n\n \n The above is true, because of the fact that our Creator is 'in' His Word/Son. He was 'begotten' inside of Christ according to the same Three into the One (1John 5:8) formula that governs the relationship of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit (from Three witnesses post). So, as the central circle enlarges to engulf the other two (left and right) sections, God is also In Christ enlarging at the same time. This is the process being described by Paul throughout his Thirteen Gentile Epistles as . . . The . . . Mystery. Once you can visualize this teaching as a process, then the entire Bible takes on a totally new meaning. After all, even the Holy Scriptures are three witnesses of spirit (OT), water (NT, Hebrew Epistles) and blood (NT, Pauline Epistles), and formed in the triune image of God's Three Witnesses, Creation (Heavens/Heaven/Earth) and man (spirit/soul/body). That is why we can call Scripture His Living Word. \n \n Waxy << Or is \"Creator\" a general blanket term, intentionally non-specific in it's religious definition and affiliation?\n \n Your question can be taken in many ways. The Hebrew word for 'Creator' is used just five times in the Old Testament, and only once outside of the book of Isaiah. Ecc. 12:1. Those verses are (Isaiah 27:11, 40:28, 43:1, 43:15) Remember that Adam is the only seventh day man created upon this planet. Gen. 2:7. All of the other races are part of the sixth day (Gen. 1:26-28). The Adamic race enlarged upon the land and became defiled by Nephilim. Gen. 6:4. This was Satan's attempt at ending the curse of Gen. 3:14+15. That is why the Lord God flooded that region of the world, but saved Noah and his family. \n \n From those eight souls the Lord God rebuilt the Adamic race, until the time of Abraham. Then the Lord God established a covenant with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob (Israel), \"to whom belongs the adoption as sons, and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the Law and the {temple} service and the promises, whose are the fathers, and from whom is the Christ according to the flesh, who is over all, God blessed forever. Amen.\" Rom. 9:4+5. \n \n The Lord God of the OT, and the One who made the first covenant with Israel, is the same Person who established the New Covenant at the Lord's Last Passover, i.e., Jesus Christ (The Lord of the Sabbath; Matt. 12:8). Remember that this 'seventh day' started in Gen. 2:4. And again, it is 'in Christ' that the Creator Himself can be found enlarging this very day. So the Lord God can say \"I am the Creator,\" because His own identity as one of the Three Witnesses is bound up in the identity of our Creator from beyond time and space.\" That is how this prophecy shall become realized as truth, \n \n \n\"For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us; And the government will rest on His shoulders; And His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.\" Isaiah 9:6.\n\n \n Our Creator from beyond time is staring in His own show within creation, through our Lord Jesus Christ. \n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",

   "[QUOTE=debategirl88]Is the symbolism of the cross affending people? If so, why?\n \n The cross means different things to different people. For Christians it's a sign of faith and a reminder of their lord and what he did for you. To non-gentiles, it represents pretty much the same thing the swastica does...a symbol of persecution. The cross was used to torture, persecute and murder thousands of human beings, not just the Christian G_d. Many people, when they see the cross, don't see a positive message there, but a reminder of this painful era.\n \n This is why I believe that some people are offended by the cross.",

Offensive implies some emotional involvement. Besides, the separation of church and state was intended to keep government out of religion not the other way around. In fact, government is envisioned as having a hodge-podge of religions. Hence, both pagan and christian and jewish and muslim and hindu and native american symbols in front of many many government entities.\n \n Eg. There are a number of verses of Psalms at the beginning of grand canyon trails. There are also a number of hindu sayings and a number of new age names etc on similar locations in the grand canyon. This is fine. It is simply that the government is not allowed to make any law abridging the free exercise of religion. The founders fully anticipated many different religions in government. For the specific purpose of religious freedom.\n \n The issue of offense is one chiefly of intolerance. I believe that is what montalban is getting at. I don't propose to speak for him however. If I am offended at the site of the goddes of justice (blind) in front of a court house then that is my problem. And it is a pagan religion. Talk to any pagan and they will claim their religion.

   "(Barger v. Barringer, 151 C.C. 433, 66 S.E. 439), Justice Brown of the Supreme Court of North Carolina had, however, referred to the same maxim as belonging to the common law, and given a very remarkable exposition of it: \n \"The ancient maxim of the common law, 'Sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas,' is not founded in any human statute, but in that sentiment expressed by Him Who taught good will toward men, and said, 'Love thy neighbour as thyself.' Freely translated, it enjoins that every person in the use of his own property should avoid injury to his neighbour as much as possible. No one ought to have the legal right to make a malicious use of his property for no benefit to himself, but merely to injure his fellow man. To hold otherwise makes the law an engine of oppression with which to destroy the peace and comfort of a neighbour, as well as to damage his property for no useful purpose, but solely to gratify a wicked and debasing passion.\"\n http://www.catholicculture.org/docs...cfm?recnum=2883\n \n \nClearly displaying a cross has no secular purpose, and it endorses Christianity, so it fails points one and two, and so is clearly unconstitutional.\n\n \n Okay, now that I've found this... it seems apparent that you have no problem with secular symbolism... what then of pagan ones? Why is it you are ant-Christian symbols and not any other religion?\n \n \nThe only reason you even have those religious freedoms is that alot of effort has gone into making sure that the government doesn't endorse any religion. You can do what you want, but the Govenment must, by the constitution, remain agnostic.\n\n That's simply not true. By not endorsing any one Christian religion, doesn't mean a rejection of Christianity - and an acceptence of agnosticism. That's simply a connection that doesn't work.\n \n It is quite clear that when your President gets up in Congress and says \"God bless America\", he is not being agnostic. He's just not ascribing to any one particular god.\n Further to that, the Christian influence in US law formation is equally apparent\n AND In the \"Christian influence: modern law, and in the formation of the United States\" thread I gave a specific example of Christian influence on law formation in the modern era\n \n \n \"Preambles to State Constitutions Based on the Bible's Influence \n ....\n ALABAMA 1901: We, the people of the State of Alabama, in order to establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, invoking the favor and guidance of Almighty God, do ordain and establish the following Constitution and form of government for the State of Alabama.

Stevenson.\"\n http://www.thepaisleysnail.com/information.shtml\n \n The idea of 'love thy neighbour' is an old one...\n Muhammad urges people to look after their brothers; by this he means other Muslims.\n The Jews had a similarly narrow outlook on 'neighbour'\n For Hammurabi, it was your immediate neighbour\n \n However, Jesus Christ ruled that all men are your brothers.\n \n The Jews had the 'eye for an eye' concept: Exodus 21:24; Lev. 24:20; Deut. 19:21\n They also had the 'love thy neighbour' concept: Lev. 19:18\n both of which Jesus touches upon in St. Matthew's Gospel\n \n Look at what He says in the Gospel of St. Matthew on the 'eye for an eye'.\n Mat 5\n 38 \"You have heard that it was said, 'Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.'\n 39 But I tell you, Do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also\n \n That is, He's completely over-turning the notion of revenge! Next, what does He say about 'neighbour'?\n Mat 5\n 43 \"You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbour and hate your enemy.' \n 44 But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, \n 45 that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.\n \n Note He says \"you've heard this...\" then \"BUT I tell you...\". He's over-turning the rules of the past and preaching universal love.\n \n He repeats the message\n Mat 19\n 19 Jesus replied, \" 'Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony, honour your father and mother,' and 'love your neighbour as yourself.'\n \n Mark 12\n 28 One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, \"Of all the commandments, which is the most important?\" \n 29 \"The most important one,\" answered Jesus, \"is this: 'Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.\n 30 Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.'\n 31 The second is this: 'Love your neighbour as yourself.' There is no commandment greater than these.\" \n 32 \"Well said, teacher,\" the man replied. \"You are right in saying that God is one and there is no other but him.\n 33 To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbour as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.\" \n 34 When Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, \"You are not far from the kingdom of God.\" And from then on no one dared ask him any more questions.\n \n Especially important is...\n Luke 10\n 25 On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. \"Teacher,\" he asked, \"what must I do to inherit eternal life?\" \n 26 \"What is written in the Law?\" he replied. \"How do you read it?\" \n 27 He answered: \" 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind' ; and, 'Love your neighbour as yourself.' \n 28 \"You have answered correctly,\" Jesus replied. \"Do this and you will live.\" \n 29 But he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, \"And who is my neighbour?\"\n ....(see parable of the Good Samaritan at this point)\n 36 \"Which of these three do you think was a neighbour to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?\" \n 37 The expert in the law replied, \"The one who had mercy on him.\" Jesus told him, \"Go and do likewise.\"\n \n He is not referring to a literal neighbour at all, but one who has concern for someone else.\n \n It is why St. Paul said...\n Romans 13\n 10 Love does no harm to its neighbour. Therefore love is the fulfilment of the law.\n \n Galatians 5\n 14 The entire law is summed up in a single command: \"Love your neighbour as yourself.\"\n \n And James said...\n James 2\n 8 If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, \"Love your neighbour as yourself,\" you are doing right.\n \n The prominence of 'neighbour' as being all men whom you might have some contact/influence with was the idea behind Lord Aitken's ruling...\n \n I shall give a bit of info about the case. Ms Donaghue attended a restaurant wherein she had a meal and a bottle of ginger-beer. The bottle was opaque (so you couldn't see the contents), and was still sealed (that it had come like that direct from the factory). She had some of the drink, then a bit more and noticed the decomposing bits of a snail inside the drink. She became ill. She took Stevenson to court (his company made the drink), however, it was the rule of law that as no contract existed between her and the drink maker, that she had no right under existing law (because the contract existed between the Stevenson and the restaurant, and then a contract between Donaghue and the restaurant.\n \n This case went all the way to the House of Lords. The minority ruling was against the applicant. That up till this point people were unprotected in law. Lord Buckmeister, one of the two dissenting Law Lords said basically \"There's no law protecting her, therefore it should be thrown out!\"*\n \n Commenting on a lower court... \"The Court below had proceeded on the general principle that in an ordinary case a manufacturer is under no duty to any one with who he is not in contractual relation...\"**\n 1932 Law Reports, House of Lords, p534. also cited as 1932 Law Reports 534\n \n However, speaking for the majority, Lord Aitken said... \"The rule that you are to love your neighbour becomes in law, you must not injure your neighbour; and the lawyer's question, Who is my neighbour? receives a restricted reply. You must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omission which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour. Who then, in law, is my neighbour? The answer seems to be - persons who are so closely and directly affected by my act that I ought reasonably to have them in contemplation as being so affected when I am directing my mind to the acts or omissions which are called in question.\" \n http://www.lawscot.org.uk/whatis/case5.html\n \n \"Doubtless, any lawyer vaguely familiar with the development of tortious liability appreciates the consequences of the decision handed down on 26 May....In order to reach that conclusion, it was necessary for the court to formulate a broad principle that went beyond the categories previously recognised. In fact, the specific categories were replaced with a principle so wide in scope that it laid the foundation for the modern law of negligence.\"\n Thooher, J \"Still silvery on its diamond jubilee? On the trail of that elusive snail\" in Law Institute Journal Vol 66 [1992] 379\n \n \"In the House of Lords, her appeal was upheld. What interests us here is the very practical application made by Lord Aitkin of Christ's teachings.\"\n http://www.catholicculture.org/docs...cfm?recnum=2883\n \n \"For the Christian Church, it was the legal affirmation of the basic moral precept that one should \"love thy neighbour\" or at least not to do anything to hurt him or her...\"\n Thooher, J \"Still silvery on its diamond jubilee? On the trail of that elusive snail\" in Law Institute Journal Vol 66 [1992] 382\n \n Once this had been established by the ruling in the House of Lords (where the case was heard), it had an immediate effect on all courts within the common law world; including America through 'persuasive effect'.*** From this, legislators began to enact laws protecting the end user of products... to those that owe a 'duty of care' to the end user.\n \"This decision was immediately accepted in England as a milestone in the development of common law - as recognising a 'tort of negligence... Donoghue v Stevenson has had almost revolutionary importance to the common law world as a whole. The trail of the snail leads from London to Adelaide, from Ottawa to Singapore.\"\n Smith, T B, \"British Justice: The Scottish Contribution\" (1961), pp51-52\n \n \"The case established the general principle of (tort of) negligence, that is, that persons who have some relation or proximity owe a duty of care to each other. Since it was established, this precedent has been further refined and applied and referred to in thousands of fact situations where a person complains of physical harm to their person or property.\"\n http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/repor...nsf/pages/clr_4\n \n \n *Lord Buckmesiter said \"Now the common law must be sought in law books by writers of authority and in judgments of the judges entrusted with its administration. The law books give no assistance...There can be no special duty attaching to the manufacture of food apart from that implied by contract or imposed by statute.\"\n \n **There were two legislated exceptions...\n a) when the product was of its nature dangerous (e.g. TNT)\n b) when the article is dangerous to the knowledge of the manufacturer.\n \n ***persuasive effect is where a court deals with a new issue, it will look to similar courts rulings within similar jurisdictions, and if not, to further afield.\n \n Appendix\n The original text of the case can be found at\n http://www.leeds.ac.uk/law/hamlyn/donoghue.htm\"\n \n \nWith regards to this specific case, here's the relevant law:\n \n \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\"\n \n I. ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE PRINCIPLES\n \n * The Constitution forbids not only state practices that \"aid one religion...or prefer one religion over another,\" but also those practices that \"aid all religions\" and thus endorse or prefer religion over nonreligion. Everson v. Board of Education of Ewing, 330 U.S. 1, 15 (1947).\n \n * In determining whether a particular practice violates the Establishment Clause, courts must apply the three-pronged test established by the Supreme Court in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971). Where the government's action fails any one of the following three prongs, it is unconstitutional:\n \n (1) whether the government's action has a secular purpose;\n (2) whether the primary effect is to advance or endorse religion, and\n (3) whether the policy or practice fosters an excessive entanglement between government and religion.\n\n \n Yet in the Mormons case the US government has made laws with respect the restriction of religious activitiy...\n Reynolds v. United States 98 US 145 (1879) \n Decision of the Court: Upheld federal law prohibiting polygamy.\n \n United States v. West (7 Utah)\n Decision of the Court: Upheld lower courts decision on both counts of polygamy and adultery. \n \n Swancoat v. State (4 Tex app., 105)\n Decision of the Court: Bigamy and adultery are not the same offense, nor maintainable by the same evidence.\n \n Owens and Bealy v. State 94 Ala., 97\n Decision of the Court: Bigamy and adultery are distinct offenses and a person may be convicted and punished for each under the same state of facts. \n \n Miles v. United States 103 U.S. 304 (1887) \n Decision of the Court: Spouse to testify in prosecutions against the other for Bigamy, polygamy, or unlawful cohabitation. \n \n Snow v. United States 120 U.S. 274 (1887)\n Decision of the Court: The supreme Court reversed a Utah Third District Court decision that indicted Lorenzo Snow three times for the same offense. \n \n Nielsen v. United States 131 U.S. 176 (1889)\n Decision of the Court: The Supreme Court reversed a Utah Third District Court decision that imprisoned petitioner twice for the same offense. \n \n Davis v. Beason 133 US 333 (1890)\n Decision of the Court: Upheld conviction for falsely taking oath that one was not member of polygamous organization. \n \n Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints v. US 136 US 1 (1890)\n Decision of the Court: Upheld revocation of Mormon Church charter and confiscation of church property. \n \n United States v. Mormon Church \n 150 U.S. 145 (1893)\n Decision of the Court: Upheld previous decision made in 1890 (136 US 1). \n \n Murphy v.

   "No, I'm trying to question your logic. Out of the plethora of symbols surrounding the courts - you choose one set, the Christian, to question. You of course don't think you're anti-Christian in doing so, but it seems rather odd when you attack the Cross, and not any of the other symbolism; pagan, secular etc.\n \n It is in fact an illustration of your own bias, and also your own lack of insight into that bias. You have no problem it seems with pagan goddesses, pagan eagles clutching arrows and twigs, all-seeing eyes, etc.\n \n Just as above you simply assumed that some kind of American symbolism \"7-19\" was normative. As it stands, this only represents a 'date of posting' for you and some others.\n\n \n It's not my lack on insight, but your lack of eyesight. 7-19 is the format that this very forum, which you're reading right now, uses. You simply decided that you wanted to find fault, rather than attempt to understand.\n \n Likewise, your inability to understand the differerence between using the symbols of an acitve modern religion, and either secular symbols or symbols from a religion that's been dead for generations, is simply you deciding that you'd rather the issue be some anti-christian movement, rather than what it actually is, which is seperation of church and state.",

You result to quantity over quality.\n \n Your point, and I use the term loosely, seems to be that because states governments use the word God in their preambles, and because you can't do anything you want in the name of religion, that seperation of church and state is a myth. You really wasted alot of time there. The highest law in the United States is the Supreme Court. The law I quoted was from the Supreme Court, and is the one that counts. Naturally in a 200 year history you'll find legal precedent where the courts had to rule on matters that pertained to religion, but the Constitutional principal of seperation of church and state has always been the guide.\n \n Or perhaps your \"point\" is that religion has influenced the laws of the US? Duh! Is that supposed to be a news flash? You take your religion on an all or nothing basis, but fortunately those who wrote US law were able to look at religion and pick out that bits of morality that worked, without feeling the need to impose the entire framework on everyone.\n \n So, in summary, the Supreme Court decision is, in point of legal fact, absolute; and I hope you don't get CTS from trying to defend a position that has no basis in reality.",

This is truly arrogant stuff.\n \nYour point, and I use the term loosely, seems to be that because states governments use the word God in their preambles, and because you can't do anything you want in the name of religion, that seperation of church and state is a myth. \n\n No, that's not it. You said that the separation of church and state leads the state to be agnostic. I simply have shown a whole lot of evidence to show that your connection is simply based on your own wishful thinking. You simply miss that just because the state doesn't promote any one religion, does not mean that it is irreligious.\n \nYou really wasted alot of time there. The highest law in the United States is the Supreme Court. \n\n That's not true. The Supreme Court is not a law. The Constitution of the USA is the highest law in the USA. It is the right of the Supreme Court to interpret the law.\n \n The law I quoted was from the Supreme Court, and is the one that counts. Naturally in a 200 year history you'll find legal precedent where the courts had to rule on matters that pertained to religion, but the Constitutional principal of seperation of church and state has always been the guide.\n\n Here you contradict yourself. You quoted from the US Constitution, giving your absolute rule re: separation of church and state. Then you admit that in fact exceptions can be made because the Supreme Court can interpret that law. And I too gave examples, just in relation to the Mormon church - but there are heaps of others; therefore it is illogic of you to argue that you should remove the cross from a court based on the notion of a separation of church and state - further to that there's no one Christian church anyway, so you're not separating 'a church' from the state... Historcially that's why that clause was added - because in Britain, from whence you rebelled, there was a church-state relationship - the Anglican church is not separated from the state.\n So, saying \"We separate church from state\" is merely to say \"We will not support any one church\", not that \"we are anti-Christian\"\n \nOr perhaps your \"point\" is that religion has influenced the laws of the US? Duh! Is that supposed to be a news flash? You take your religion on an all or nothing basis, but fortunately those who wrote US law were able to look at religion and pick out that bits of morality that worked, without feeling the need to impose the entire framework on everyone.\n\n The 'bits that worked' is another insight into your wishful thinking. When Jesus proclaimed a message of universal love, and said that this law is in fact one of two laws that we should all keep - I hardly would term that 'a bit' of Christianity. It's central to Christianity. You seem almost ashamed that the teachings of Christ have had such a positive influence.\n \nSo, in summary, the Supreme Court decision is, in point of legal fact, absolute; and I hope you don't get CTS from trying to defend a position that has no basis in reality.\n\n I don't know what CTS is. I expect you to run with that admission for a while too.\n Which Supreme Court decision are you saying is absolute in relation to the keeping of Christian religious symbols on federal property (to the exclusion of pagan religious symbols)?",

   "A summary of the opposing view is that Christian religious symbols should be removed from courts etc. because of the 1st Amendment of the United States Constitution. \n \n The problem with this stems from the fact that the amendment of the Constitution is about ensuring that the Federal government makes no laws in favour of any one religious group, not about removing religion all together. Given that limitation of interpretation, the US government is not in favour of any one religious group because it allows religious symbols from Christian and pagan origins. It is not favouring one over the other, but merely recognising that both have been an influence on the formation of the United States. Simply put, the courts don't show Buddhist symbols, because their influence on US courts is minimal :)\n \n Kronous believes that the law (above) should or is meant to make the USA agnostic. He has yet to show why. I endeavoured to show the US states have \"God\" in their states constitutions; this does not mean they are agnostic...in fact it suggest the opposite. The federal government too, doesn't state \"In (a probable) God we trust\".\n \n So far, his only defence for the keeping of pagan symbols over Christian ones is that most people are unaware of what they mean, or what their origin is. Not only is this a rather odd idea; that ignorance in the general population should allow a loop-hole in his interpretation of the Constitution, but it in fact shows that the Christian influence is still alive and well - as most people (even as he admits) would recognise a cross. He's sort of suggesting that the government should penalise Christians (by removing only their symbols) because they're continuing to be recognised... which is of itself odd, because symbols, of their very nature represent something.\n \n \n What he is suggesting is discrimination - removal of only Christian symbols. I asked him if he believed the pagan ones should be removed too, and he didn't say this should happen.\n \n His argument makes as much sense as proposing the removal of Latin phrases from various state's mottos, for they undermine education in English. (They are there because that's something called 'heritage'). The USA should take pride in its Christian heritage too.",

The symbolism of the cross works on several levels, yes, religious, but other levels too. You simply concentrate on one -stating that because it is a religious one, it must be removed. The cross also represents your Christian past, and it could be seen to represent that too - as the cross also appears on various US state flags - various national flags too, for that matter - but none of these flags are 'religious' in the Christian sense. They have increased their meaning. BUT because they were once symbols of Christianity, you want them, and only them removed - hence you're arguing for the retention of pagan symbols because no one (according to your opinion) worships them any more. It's rather a convoluted reasoning you offer.\n I expect you're therefore equally against the religious symbols on states flags; Hawaii, and many southern states have crosses on them directly and historically linked to Christian symbolism. And you'd be for the remoulding of the various awards; such as the Navy Cross etc, because as far as your argument goes, the cross once had only a religious symbolism, therefore they've all gone in violation of an amendment of the US Constitution.\n But hey, no just the cross in federal building, huh?\n I like bad sci-fi and horror films.* You're kind of like a vampire where no matter where you see a cross-shape, even if it's just two twigs lifted up and crossed over, you hiss and spit. because it's that power a religious symbol.\n \nI'd like to get these minor distractions out of the way before address the main issue, which is why the separation of church and state is a good thing. Is there anything else before we dive into the meat and potatoes?\n\n I won't argue that it's a good thing per se. Although my nation is not ashamed to have God mentioned in our constitution (and ours is far more recent than yours)\n The preamble reads...\n \"Whereas the people of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, and Tasmania, humbly relying on the blessing of Almighty God, have agreed to unite in one indissoluble Federal Commonwealth under the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and under the Constitution hereby established:\"\n http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/general/constitution/preamble.htm\n We too are in favour of separation of church and state. We don't see any problem with this, but somehow you do (in an American setting) - although as stated, you've got a very highly convoluted argument; ignoring pagan symbolism, and picking on Christian symbolism, excepting Bibles, but only when it's in a federal building in the form of a cross - except on flags, medals etc. I expect you can't go out in sunlight or see your own reflection either - perhaps Cronos would be better spelling :) LOL\n I have no problem with the US having separation of Church and State, I've already stated why you do, in an historical sense - to differentiate from the state-sponsored church that Britain had (and still has).\n \n \n *all up, I've almost 600 films on DVD",

Therefore, the onus is yours to prove it. Show us a link to the Church of Justice, or any other evidence that anyone alive today believes that the statue is in any way a holy symbol.\n\n I am happy to prove my claim that it is a religious symbol. It is the symbol of a Roman goddess. There's a photo of one statue being removed...\n http://t-rob.com/12news.htm\n \"McLennan County Courthouse:\n Three statues grace the top of the building, two representing classical, mythological female figures: Themis, the Greek goddess of Justice, and Justitia, the Roman goddess of Justice. The third statue is of Liberty, the torchbearer. Additionally, twelve eagles perch atop the courthouse. Inside, one will find walnut, oak, granite and marble, along with a renovated terrazzo flooring and the artwork of local artist, Ruth Smith.\"\n http://www.pakislaw.com/cm/Custom/Custom30.asp\n \"The website for the Merced County Courthouse in California says, \"The statutes on the (courthouse) roof represent 'Justica,' an ancient Roman goddess of justice. Overlooking the other statues is Minerva, the Roman goddess of wisdom. The blindfolded classic figure of Justice illustrates impartiality. The sword represents the strict administration of justice as fairly determined by the scale.\"\n http://radio.embassyofheaven.com/radio/T9835C.htm\n (PS, I don't endorse their views re: Satan :) but I keep this one here for some light relief)\n Now, prove to me that no one worships Roman gods anymore. :)\n This was your claim.\n \n Nah, I'm not saying that they've lost their religious symbolism, I'm saying that they've gained secular symbolism too - in a secular context such as in a court house. The symbolism of the cross works on several levels, yes, religious, but other levels too. You simply concentrate on one -stating that because it is a religious one, it must be removed.\n\n \nIf the Christian cross has acquired any secular meaning, it is completely overshadowed by its religious meaning, regardless of setting. If I went into a church and peed on one of the crosses there, you'd be outraged at my blasphemy, as well you should. If I then went to a courthouse and peed on a cross there, would your thoughts be \"Hm, shouldn't pee in public.\" Of course not. You'd still be outraged. The cross is one of the most holy symbols of Christianity, and will be regarded as such no matter what the setting.\n\n Oh, dear, you've missed the idea of context. In a church, it's religious. On a flag, as an example, it's secular. If not, then you'd be calling for the removal of all flags that display a cross, from public buildings too, and you don't.\n Oddly enough, I'd be angered if you peed in a court-room too. You seem to have no concept of context. It's unlikely I'd ever invite you round for lunch, if this is an indication of your manners.\n Incidentally, the cross on all those southern states that have some form of the confederate flag are displaying the Cross of St.Andrew - who was crucified on an X-shaped cross, and is thus very Christian. The flag of Hawaii has the Cross of St.George, the Cross of St. Andrew, and the Cross of St.Patrick all on it. This must make you very angry.\n The Navy Cross must also be reshaped.\n Here is why I suggest your theory is highly convoluted, because you state that the cross is religious, no matter where, no matter when - you deny 'context'. Yet, you're only against it in one form in one place.\n \nSo, to summarize, move a religious symbol out of one building and into another building two blocks down, and its still a religious symbol. Take a holy symbol, and move it forward centuries in time, to a point where no one worships the religion it used to be a part of, and it loses all religious symbology.\n\n See above.\n \np.s. \n Is your bone of contention here just that you feel that Christianity is being singled out, and nothing else? I wouldn't want to waste everyone's time defending points that are irrelevant.\n\n Certainly you have singled Christianity out, you're happy about pagan symbolism all over court houses. The 'scales of justice' are from Libra. The faces are from Roman paganism and are a symbol of power and authority.",

There's a photo of one statue being removed...\n Now, prove to me that no one worships Roman gods anymore. :)\n This was your claim.\n \n\n All that proves is that it's a staute of an ancient Roman goddess. That was never an issue. If no one worships her, then she's not a religious symbol, it's that simple. \n \n As for my proof, I googled for \"Church of Themis\", and got zero hits. How about that. I'm sure you're well aware that proving something doesn't exist is often practically impossible. Whereas showing that something does exist is straight forward, just show an example. If such an example did exist I'm sure you would have found it by now.\n \n \n\n Oh, dear, you've missed the idea of context. In a church, it's religious. On a flag, as an example, it's secular.\n\n My definition of a cross is not two lines crossing. Or, for the sake of clarity, we could call two lines that intersect a cross, while the Christian holy symbol is the Cross, capital C. Whatever the origin of the lines of the various flags, they're just lines now, with no religious significance. Whereas the Christian Cross is and always will be a religious symbol, no matter where it is. \n \n Here's a bit of case history, concerning the use of the Christian fish symbol in an official seal.\n \n Webb brings overwhelming evidence before the Court to show that only one conclusion is possible: when viewing the fish on Republic's flag, a reasonable observer would conclude that it is a Christian religious symbol...Almost all other courts examining the inclusion of a religious symbol within a city seal have found them in contravention of the principles of separation of church and state...While the citizens of Republic may have intended that its seal send only a message of moral values or promote 'a universal symbol of religion,' an applaudable motive cannot save the city seal from a violation of the Establishment Clause..\n http://www.religioustolerance.org/sep_c_s1.htm\n \n Thus, your argument that the Cross may have other, secular, symbolism is irrelevant. Any reasnable observe must conclude that the Cross is a Christian relgious symbol, and thus violates the establishment clause.\n \n \n\n Certainly you have singled Christianity out, you're happy about pagan symbolism all over court houses. The 'scales of justice' are from Libra. The faces are from Roman paganism and are a symbol of power and authority.\n\n \n Please don't avoid the question.

   "Hi Kronus:\n \n \nKronus << Allow me to point out that the Decleration of Independance is in no way what so ever a legal document. \n \n Are you trying to say that our Declaration of Independence is an illegal document? BTW, not everyone agrees with you.\n \n http://morphogeneticjon.tripod.com/decindp.html\n \n Here is one argument: \n \n \nAt the top of the document, it says, \"Action of Second Continental Congress, July 4, 1776 The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen United States of America.\" This is the document that declares the formation of a new country. This document established that the new country's name is the United States of America. The document was approved by the Second Continental Congress, which was the only federal government law-making body at that time, and it was adopted by all of the states. This proves it is a legal document, and because it establishes the name of our country, it is obviously America's first legal document.\n\n \n \nKronus << No laws are based on, or derived from, the DOI. It's just a letter that was written to the British.\n \n \n You seem quick to denounce our Declaration of Independence over the use of this word 'Creator.' Try here:\n \n http://www.agitatedamerican.com/2_3.html\n \n Is the Declaration of Independence a legal document?\n \n \nWe Americans, the masses---you know, gutter rats, those who do all the work to bring wealth to the wealthy---we believe in the sanctity of the Declaration of Independence. \n \n Some say it is not a legal document. Perhaps not---you can't take someone to court for not upholding it. Yet, because it describes in exquisite felicity our reason for being, not just as a nation, but as a people, it is our standard, our banner. Our obligation to a British monarchy created the need for it, our need to remain free keeps it alive.\n\n \n \nKronus << The Constitution, upon which are laws are based, makes absolutely no claims about a Creator. The founding fathers were very careful to make that distinction.\n \n \n Those words already appear in our Declaration of Independence. The above author continues: \n \n \n\"The Declaration, even more than the Constitution, is the people's document---it's drafters, the revolutionaries, were just people when they wrote it up---they became dignitaries later. Its reason for being is its name. Not just written for its time, it made independence possible forever afterward. If the Declaration is a guidepost, it is also a destination. It spawned the need for its own road map, the Constitution.\n \n The Constitution was born to be changed, and changed it has been. The Declaration may never be changed. It may not be legally enforceable, but we dare anyone, on moral grounds, to try to take it away from us.\"\n\n \n \nKronus << They were religious people, but they took great care to make sure that religion did not become enshrined in the structure of government.\n\n \n And that is why liberty pertaining to freedom of religion is the very first point addressed in the First Amendment of our Bill of Rights? \n \n \nKronus << As for the first amendment, how does removing crosses from governement buildings prevent you from worshipping the way you want?\n\n \n Worship is only one part of freedom of expression of our religion. Does the term 'worship' appear in the legal document? You are attempting to restrict our liberty and freedom to exercise our religion in any way 'we' see fit. It is not for you or anyone else to define those terms. Those things are defined by each individual. Our religious liberty does not stop on our front porches. It stops at your front porch. How did those symbols come to be placed there in the first place? Who was exercising their freedom of religion? Those things are part of our American heritage already, as they were placed there by our forefathers before us. \n \n Since congress has no authority to create any law that prohibits the free exercise of religion, then no judge has the authority to remove one cross or Ten Commandments monument from our public places. After all, it is not for our judges to render decisions based upon their personal opinions. They are legally bound to interpret and apply the laws passed by congress, as they 'ARE' written. \n \n Removing any religious symbol from any public place, because of the First Amendment, is unconstitutional and illegal. Again, the language within our First Amendment forbids congress from making laws. It is not a blanket answer for atheists to remove anything from our public places. \n \n In Christ,\n \n Terral",

You can do what you want, but the Govenment must, by the constitution, remain agnostic. \n \n \n No sir. The government will become agnostic the day that a majority of our representatives become a group of faithless unbelievers. Please allow me to quote from our Declaration of Independence:\n \n http://www.rangerheros.netfirms.com/id20.htm\n \n Quote:\n We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.\n \n That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. \n \n \n The documents that establish this United States of America were not drafted and amended by a bunch of spiritually impotent agnostics. Our freedoms are based upon the self evident truth that all men 'are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights.' \n \n Again, the very First Amendment to our US Constitution says that congress shall make no law prohibiting the free exercise of religion. Only after this first point is made perfectly clear do we get to the part out our free speech, press, etc.. \n \n God bless,\n \n Terral\n\n \n I asked you these questions - \n \n \nWhat makes you think that the \"Creator\" is strictly the God of Abraham or the Christian God? \n \n Is that specified anywhere?\n \n Or is \"Creator\" a general blanket term, intentionally non-specific in it's religious definition and affiliation?\n \n Waxy\n\n \n Apparently you missed the context of my question. I wasn't asking you for a (very detailed) biblical explanation of the Creator, I've got the gist of that.\n \n I was asking you how you know that the Creator referred to in the the Declaration of Independence was the Christian God of Abraham.\n \n So again, slightly rephrased - \n \n Is that stated anywhere in the D of I? \n \n Or was the intent of the word \"Creator\" to be a general term that leaves the door open to any god, spirit, fluke of nature that resulted in the creation of man so as to be not specific to any one religion?\n \n Also, I noticed your use of the words \"your\" and \"our\" in your post. No big deal really, but in the future, please refrain from including me in your beliefs. \n \n Thanks.\n \n Waxy",

Entrance to Harvard required strong knowledge of the Bible. The money was printed, \"One Nation Under God.\" Noah Webster wrote the dictionary with Bible verses explained so children could understand the words of God and know the truth of Jesus Christ.

Even though it's not used as a religious symbol in a secular context - because people aren't going to a library to pray, it's still a religious symbol, regardless of it's time or context AND YET all the other religious symbols around aren't religious symbols if they're in a secular context - e.g. on a flag etc.\n \nNow, prove to me that no one worships Roman gods anymore. \n This was your claim.\n\n \nAll that proves is that it's a staute of an ancient Roman goddess. That was never an issue. If no one worships her, then she's not a religious symbol, it's that simple. \n\n Firstly, I don't 'worship' the cross. I venerate it.\n Secondly, you denied that the cross in a secular context ceases to be a religious symbol - you said several centuries don't take this meaning away, and yet it somehow does for pagan god statues.\n I have shown it is a religious symbol -what else is a statue of a 'godess'? You have stated that a distance of centuries does not lessen it's religiousness - in the case of the Cross, at least\n \nAs for my proof, I googled for \"Church of Themis\", and got zero hits. How about that. I'm sure you're well aware that proving something doesn't exist is often practically impossible. Whereas showing that something does exist is straight forward, just show an example. If such an example did exist I'm sure you would have found it by now.\n\n a) it was your claim that there were no pagans worshipping her, so you need to prove this, not I.\n b) you are searching for a church dedicated to a particular goddess, and this doesn't discount pagans worshipping her, because pagans worshipped many gods at the same time.\n So, try looking at \"Goddess worship\"\n http://notendur.centrum.is/~snorrigb/Cult-fem.htm#Goddess worship\n They mention not just Roman gods/godesses, but Egyptian ones too, just as in ancient times, they accepted all the pantheon of other pagan groups. So, here you're applying a wrong method of searching out pagans.\n \nOh, dear, you've missed the idea of context. In a church, it's religious. On a flag, as an example, it's secular. \n\n \nMy definition of a cross is not two lines crossing. Or, for the sake of clarity, we could call two lines that intersect a cross, while the Christian holy symbol is the Cross, capital C. Whatever the origin of the lines of the various flags, they're just lines now, with no religious significance. Whereas the Christian Cross is and always will be a religious symbol, no matter where it is. \n\n It's not just two lines intersecting. It's the Cross of St.Andrew, a revered religious symbol, showing that St. Andrew died on a cross, shaped like an 'X', just as St.Peter was crucified on a cross upside-down, etc.\n \"The Confederate battle flag, called the \"Southern Cross\" or the cross of St. Andrew, has been described variously as a proud emblem of Southern heritage and as a shameful reminder of slavery and segregation. In the past, several Southern states flew the Confederate battle flag along with the U.S. and state flags over their statehouses. Others incorporated the controversial symbol into the design of their state flags. The Confederate battle flag has also been appropriated by the Ku Klux Klan and other racist hate groups. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, more than 500 extremist groups use the Southern Cross as one of their symbols.\"\n http://www.factmonster.com/spot/confederate1.html\n \"The Design of the Confederate Battle Flag Has a Glorious History of Both Celtic and Christian Heritage\"\n http://www.truthinhistory.org/flag.htm\n To ignore it's religious heritage is the ultmate straw-man of this debate of yours, to re-work the argument, remove this symbolism (you just described it as a mere two lines intersecting), and then deabte that.\n But then you do rely on the 'ignorance denies a religious meaning' argument.\n The crosses on the state flag of Hawaii, I've already mentioned, but you seem to have ignored are the crosses of St. George, St.Andrew and St.Patrick.\n The big red cross is St.George\n The white on blue is the cross of St.Andrew (note it's shaped like an \"X\")\n and a similar shape is the red X of St. Patrick.. its directly from the British Union Flag (commonly known as the Union Jack) which represents the patron Saints of England, Scotland and Ireland.\n \nHere's a bit of case history, concerning the use of the Christian fish symbol in an official seal.\n Webb brings overwhelming evidence before the Court to show that only one conclusion is possible: when viewing the fish on Republic?s flag, a reasonable observer would conclude that it is a Christian religious symbol...Almost all other courts examining the inclusion of a religious symbol within a city seal have found them in contravention of the principles of separation of church and state...While the citizens of Republic may have intended that its seal send only a message of moral values or promote ?a universal symbol of religion,? an applaudable motive cannot save the city seal from a violation of the Establishment Clause..\n http://www.religioustolerance.org/sep_c_s1.htm \n\n The Cross of St.Andrew is a religious symbol on a flag.\n \n Thus, your argument that the Cross may have other, secular, symbolism is irrelevant. Any reasnable observe must conclude that the Cross is a Christian relgious symbol, and thus violates the establishment clause.\n\n Then, the cross of St.Andrew is religious, and therefore should also be removed; excpet you're trying every argument to remove only one religious symbol -and I guess that's not you being anti-Christian :)\n And, this is only based on the notion that if aren't aware it's a religious symbol, then it's not a religious symbol!\n Further, how is having a cross establishing a religion?\n \nCertainly you have singled Christianity out, you're happy about pagan symbolism all over court houses. The 'scales of justice' are from Libra. The faces are from Roman paganism and are a symbol of power and authority. \n\n \nPlease don't avoid the question. Please state why you are opposed to the removal of crosses from government buildings.\n\n I'm opposed because you've singled this symbol out.\n Look at the flags of...\n Alabama\n Florida\n Hawaii\n Mississippi",

   "It's not my logic, this is just what the law says. The law also says that the government cannot endorse religion over non-religion, although I'm not sure if that touches on your objection or not.\n \n I think to avoid going around in circles here you'll really need to define what you mean by secularism. Some people use the term to mean the religion of science, which I've always felt was silly, others use it other ways; how are you using it?\n \n A final thought which I think does touch on your objection. While you are correct that the govenment can't say, \"you shouldn't be religious\", I don't believe any court would rule that saying that you can't put a cross in front of the town hall implies that the government is telling you not to be Christian.\n \n A final, final, thought. :)\n If someone wanted to teach creationism in a history of religion or philosophy class, I don't think anyone would object; it's trying to pass it off as science that causes trouble.\n\n \n Logic is necessary to apply the law. This is why I object to the logic. Secularism, I am using simply to mean, not religious, or without religion. My point is that using your logic to say that \"I don't believe any court would rule that saying that you can't put a cross in front of the town hall implies that the government is telling you not to be Christian.\" is the same logic one uses to say that putting a cross in front of a government building implies the government telling you to be a christian. To not have it there is as big a statement as having it there. \n \n It is why the supreme court has always nailed laws passed that either allow prayer in school or disallow prayer in school. Both types have been nixed.\n \n As for the creationism and evolution, it is not the passing off as science that is the problem. The court ruled it was a violation of the separation of church and state not that creationism was not science.",

You've had days to show this, and all I can see is that this law is about 'establishment of a religion'\n On issue b) you claim that the pagan symbols have lost their religious value based on your belief no one worships these gods/goddesses. You've applied one search, come up empty, and conclude that no Americans follow these Greco-Roman gods.\n You are not against the cross as it appears in other forms, either, such as on a flag, such as St.Andrew's Cross, which is no less Christian (based on your own argument that removal from a religious setting, or the passing of time, does not remove it's religiousness).\n \n Thus I still can't work out why you'd be opposed to just one particular symbol \"The Cross\".

Our government has been imbued with these from the beginning. Witness the declaration of independence and the reference to a creator. Prayers to various deities during congressional sessions on both state and federal level. To say that there are only a few is a misunderstanding of the enormity of what you propose. \n \n Second the pagan religions are highly active. I know many pagans and wiccans etc. There has been one on the board in fact. The pagans worship a god from a wide ranging pantheon. Native american religions are still practiced. Hinduism, islam, zorastrianism (sic?), worship of athena, gaea, mother earth, the moon, the stars, etc. They are all active. \n \n Our government has always had these symbols. Always. The question is should they be there. The answer lies in how is the government to NOT prefer or endorse a religion. Government absolutely cannot restrict the freedom of religion. I think we all agree on that. They are not allowed to pass any laws, impose rules or regulations which restrict the freedom of religion. There for sure we agree. The question that we are arguing is can religion effect government. It absolutely must. A government of the people, by the people, and for the people, must by its composition have people that are religious. Whether that is atheism, monotheism, pantheism, christian or muslim, people make up our government and people influence our government and their religion influences them. It is how it should be.

   "The legal principles are spelled out in post 26.\n\n I'm still waiting for you to show an actual connection with this law. I know some truths are 'self-evident' in American parlance, but not here. I looked back to that post, and it says that the Constitution forbids the establishment of any one religion. As there are religious symbols of various origins in federal use, they are not supporting any ONE religion. When, for instance you have the motto \"In God we trust\" this is clearly religious, but I need to ask 'which god/God'? It doesn't support any ONE religion - but of course, if would not support an atheistic religion, such as some forms of Buddhism.\n Nor, are they in using these symbols, ESTABLISHING a religion, because they are using the symbols in a secular context.\n IF the United States made each and every American bow before the cross in a court of law, then you might have a case. As someone not in America, I am not aware if in fact they make people do this. Do they?\n \nIt applied to all religions for which endorsement could be construed.\n\n Maybe so, but you seem to have issue with only one particular symbol.\n \nI would be happy to answer any questions you have.\n\n Really? When? You're still yet to show how you know about no pagans practicing religious worship of Roman deities; in America.\n Further, you've stated one symbol doesn't lose it's religious symbolism with the passage of time, but others do. How so? Like 'colour-fast' for religion the Cross has, for you maintained it's religious brilliance despite all the wear and tear.\n Further, you've yet to show how a law about the 'establishment of a religion' is applicable in this case. All you've done is state the law... your statement was, post 26\n \nClearly displaying a cross has no secular purpose, and it endorses Christianity, so it fails points one and two, and so is clearly unconstitutional.\n\n This is not the case. The cross of the Christian martyr, St. Andrew, as it appears on the flag of Alabama (for e.g.), is a secular one - so much so that you're not even aware of it's Christian origins. Yes, 'the' Cross is a clearly of Christian background, but if you believe that you should measure the law on the ability to recognise a symbol as a symbol then that's more a fault of your educational system.\n \nI still await your answer to my question. Why you are opposed to the removal of crosses from government buildings? If you aren't, then please say so plainly.\n\n I'm happy to oblige, although this pathway of info seems to run one-way, and I thought I'd made this clear...\n I am opposed to the selective removal of symbols from public buildings. These symbols seem to be singled out for 'special consideration', as you ignore\n a) pagan religious symbols\n b) other Christian symbols\n It's nice of you to state above that the 'law' applies to them all, but for you, you've argued the opposite. And this is intriguing.\n \n Here's a novel argument...\n Jesus is also recognised by the Dalai Lama, Moslems, and Baha'i et al as a person of great religious prestige, so I could argue that any symbol for him, whilst 'Christian', is still venerated, or respected by other religions - I know from memory that when the film \"The Last Temptation of Christ\" screened in Sydney there were 'born-again' protestors, and Moslem ones too! (The Moslems 'respect' him, and believe that the film, although ostensibly Christian, insulted one of 'their' prophets)",

If I have to take on the task of proving the non-existence of something, then I would like you to first tell me what you would except as proof. Give me some definite guidlines. And to clarify, my specific point is that no one is worshipping Themis, the goddess that Justice is based on. There are American Pagans who consider Demeter to be one aspect of the Mother-Goddess.\n \n \n\n Further, you've stated one symbol doesn't lose it's religious symbolism with the passage of time, but others do.

The desire to not have religious symbols on government property isn't an excercise in intellectual purity or philosophy. It's purely pracitical, and totally based on perception. We're not trying to remove religious symbols because we think they're icky and they should all go away, but to avoid the perception of endorsing any specific religion. The saltire (St. Andrew's cross) is, as you say, secular. The fact that its origins can be traced to the crucifiction of St. Andrew is of no import, because no one looks at the Alabama flag and thinks it has anything to do with St. Andrew. The saltire is in fact there to commemorate Scottish heritage, and that's what people think when they see the Alabama flag, if they see anything at all beyond two lines crossing. No reasonable person, to use the legal phrase, sees the Alabama flag as any sort of religious endorsement, and therefore it isn't religious endorsement, and thus is a perfectly acceptable symbol. The test isn't whether a link can be found between a symbol and any religion ever, but whether a reasonable person would look at the symbol and think that it's religious. Thus, the latin Cross, the Star of David, the Islamic moon and star, or the Buddihst wheel would all be perceived as religious symbols, whereas the saltire, the statue of Justice, the stars on the US flag, or a random tree would not be seen as religious symbols by this test.",

It would be daunting to walk into a court house and see a jewish star hanging over the doorway when I was a christian. Point well taken. However, if I were to see a star of david, the ten commandments, a cross etc, I would not worry as much. These are symbols of justice, mercy, law. I could include the usual statue with the balances. It is justice (and a pagan goddess I believe). They are not religious symbols, given that they are in a courthouse. They are symbols of justice and mercy and law. \n \n I would not expect to see the balance statue in the national parks office. I might expect to see majestic displays with quotes from the psalms, the quaran, hindu gods etc. These are the symbols of beauty that we experience in our national parks. A true gift to this nation. To have these captions is much better than the genus and species names of the trees and animals depicted or the longitude and lattitude of the locality. While these would be interesting facts, they do not inspire us to visit the park.\n \n EF",

   "If I understand you correctly, you are saying that we must not display the religious symbols of the majority. Iguess, what I am trying to communicate is that displaying a religious symbol of one religion is fine as long as one displays the religious symbols of others. \n\n That's not exactly what I meant. Certainly, displaying the symbol of the majority religion is more likely to send a message of endorsement than displaying the symbol of an obscure religion that no one in the region practices. However, I do agree with your all or nothing approach. Either display symbols for all religions, or none; nothing else is fair. However, displaying the symbols of all religions would be a huge effort, not to mention a rediculous display. There are hundreds of currently active religions, many of which use multiple symbols. There's simply no practicle way to display them all, never mind artisticaly pleasing or symbolicly relevant. The all approach would result in a mish mash of tiny little symbols, displayed at random so as not to give one a more prominent display than another.

But for the sake of arguement, Provided the monument was in good taste ( no ******* on any symbols, simply becasue ******* on anything is in bad taste) and a monument to another religion already existed, it could be proposed to add a monument or two. \n \n Trails at the grand canyon have been named after native american and hindu gods for decades. The ACLU attempted to have certain psalms removed from other trails until it was pointed out this inconsistency. This is my point. It is why I brought up the GC in the first place. \n \n If we look at things locally, it still must be kept in context of the whole. The basic prinicple must apply equally.

   "You're still yet to show how you know about no pagans practicing religious worship of Roman deities; in America.\n\n \n I have offered you the simpler task of showing that the ancient Roman deities are being worshipped, which you declined. If I have to take on the task of proving the non-existence of something, then I would like you to first tell me what you would except as proof. Give me some definite guidelines. And to clarify, my specific point is that no one is worshipping Themis, the goddess that Justice is based on. There are American Pagans who consider Demeter to be one aspect of the Mother-Goddess.\n\n By you last sentence you contradict your second last sentence. As I thought I'd pointed out, pagans worship a number of gods, they also worship many aspects of those gods - sort of like the Hindus will worship their 'god' but in many different manifestations - as a god of war, as a god of love etc. Same with the worship of Justice. You have simply applied your own reasoning to how they worship, and it doesn't conform to that, therefore they're not worshiping the goddess of Justice... hence your first rebuttal on this was a search for a specific church for her, on only one search engine.\n \nFurther, you've stated one symbol doesn't lose it's religious symbolism with the passage of time, but others do. How so? \n\n \nQuite simple. If centuries pass without anyone worshipping the religion that a symbol was part of, the symbol can lose its religious connotations, and take on other ones.\n\n Firstly, as I've stated, and you seem to misunderstand - most Christians don't 'worship' the cross; if 'worship' is your test for religion, then the cross has passed out of being a religious symbol - as it's not worshipped.\n Secondly, what is the time frame you give? Is it 10, 20, 100 years when this symbol ceases to be 'religious'?\n Thirdly, where do you place the Cross of St. Andrew in this schema?\n \nThe cross of the Christian martyr, St. Andrew, as it appears on the flag of Alabama (for e.g.), is a secular one - so much so that you're not even aware of it's Christian origins. Yes, 'the' Cross is a clearly of Christian background, but if you believe that you should measure the law on the ability to recognise a symbol as a symbol then that's more a fault of your educational system.\n\n \nI think this is the crux of your misunderstanding.\n\n Is this a pun?\n crux (krks, krks)\n n. pl. crux\u00b7es or cru\u00b7ces (krsz) \n A cross or a cross-like structure.\n http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=crux\n Our national stars are the Southern Cross (aka Crux)\n \nThe desire to not have religious symbols on government property isn't an exercise in intellectual purity or philosophy. It's purely practical, and totally based on perception. We're not trying to remove religious symbols because we think they're icky and they should all go away, but to avoid the perception of endorsing any specific religion. The saltire (St. Andrew's cross) is, as you say, secular. The fact that its origins can be traced to the crucifixion of St. Andrew is of no import, because no one looks at the Alabama flag and thinks it has anything to do with St. Andrew.\n\n I could ask you to prove that no one does this, but you'd fall back on the 'how do I prove a negative' which sort of opens the door for you to make such sweeping statements.\n I gave you a web-site about the cross where they quite clearly state it has Christian origins.\n Post 88\n \n\n \"The Design of the Confederate Battle Flag Has a Glorious History of Both Celtic and Christian Heritage\"\n http://www.truthinhistory.org/flag.htm \n\n I knew that - and sure I'm not American; I'm a Celt, but there are many in America who are aware of their heritage - Christian and Celtic - the parton St. of Scotland.\n I know the crosses on the Hawaii State flag, because we have them on the Australian flag. Your ideas are, I'm sorry to say, based on your own lack of knowledge about the origins of this... it's the Kronus Test - if Kronus doesn't know it, then it's 'not' religious.\n \n The saltire is in fact there to commemorate Scottish heritage, and that's what people think when they see the Alabama flag, if they see anything at all beyond two lines crossing. No reasonable person, to use the legal phrase, sees the Alabama flag as any sort of religious endorsement, and therefore it isn't religious endorsement, and thus is a perfectly acceptable symbol. The test isn't whether a link can be found between a symbol and any religion ever, but whether a reasonable person would look at the symbol and think that it's religious. Thus, the Latin Cross, the Star of David, the Islamic moon and star, or the Buddhist wheel would all be perceived as religious symbols, whereas the saltire, the statue of Justice, the stars on the US flag, or a random tree would not be seen as religious symbols by this test.\n \n\n Indeed, most people would recognise the Christian-ness (if that's a word) of a Cross. But a Cross in a court house has a meaning that is secular - it's called context. Unless you have Americans going to court to pray, then it is no more religious in a Federal site than any other religious symbol - hence no need just to remove one type.\n You recognise a cross on a flag as 'secular' but for some reason the context doesn't affect a Cross. It's just such a odd an sinuous application of a 'test' that it's no wonder people aren't applying it.\n \n In all this, I've been hampered by the fact I'm not in America, and never been there, so I don't know what your courts look like. I know what ours do look like as I have connection with them. However, I've looked at pics on the net, and I won't state these are normative - only you'd know that but look at\n Lenawee County Courthouse \n http://www.seicrane.com/pictures/lcc-05.jpg\n The apex of this court is the US flag. If a cross is in the court, the clear semiotics of it show that the secular symbol is on top.\n Such semiotics are significant, that's why the pic of\n Covington Co Courthouse\n has the national flag above the Florida flag\n http://community.webshots.com/photo/2701283/3301666eWfCJNEBFM\n And yes, I understand that these are County Courthouses, not Federal.\n But even the Federal Building US Courthouse picture at\n http://www.opelikaonline.com/opelika-pictures/federal-building-us-courthouse.asp\n is unmistakenly non-religious.\n I have been unable to find much internal shots, however. I'd even recommend someone going into one, taking a few photos and posting them here, except in the current climate I'd expect that'd be too dangerous.\n \n I do actually commend you Kronus. If you can go into such a place, and feel a religious presence, then there's hope for you yet :)",

If, I, and architect, design a building, let us say a court house. I wish to symbolize Justice appropriately applied. Can be difficult. Not just justice alone, as no man will plead for justice alone when he is on the recieving end of an eye for an eye. Justice is meant to be tempered with mercy. So what symbolizes that to me? A cross. For christian tradition holds and the bible teaches that the cross was a cruel instrument of punishment. It also teaches that it is the place where mercy was granted to the human race. It is the joining of the two. And so, I wish to symbolize it.\n \n I am not saying that there must be a cross at this building and do not think the government should require it be there.

   "hence your first rebuttal on this was a search for a specific church for her, on only one search engine.\n\n \nIf you won't prove your point, and you won't tell me what you'll except as proof of my point, than I don't see what I can do here.\n\n Yawn. I already told you that pagans accept a number of gods, we both agree that there are pagans in America. It was your assertion that none of them worship this particular goddess. I don't need to show that they do or don't as it's your point. However, it's just illogical for you to have made such a sweeping, and subsequently vacuous statement... and then rebut it by searching under such limited parameters... which as I stated are inappropriate for this type of religious denomination.\n The question really is, you've made such a sweeping statement, knowing that it can never be proved, and you've based this as one of your cornerstones of your argument - no pagans = no worship = not a religious symbol.\n To base one of your arguments on an unprovable is odd.\n That you'd resort to this, and the subsequent worming out of this has in fact opened up for debate the introduction of any other equally sweeping statement. Rather then just accept this, you've tried to reverse this on me making the onus for me to work the problem out for you. And to further that, you seem to accept that some Americans worship her anyway, if only in a different manifestation, thus removing 96% of your objections... because we both agree that there are modern pagans in America, and some worship Minerva and other Roman deities.\n Your statement of belief is very shaky.\n [quote=Montalban]Firstly, as I've stated, and you seem to misunderstand - most Christians don't 'worship' the cross; if 'worship' is your test for religion, then the cross has passed out of being a religious symbol - as it's not worshipped.\n Secondly, what is the time frame you give? Is it 10, 20, 100 years when this symbol ceases to be 'religious'?\n [quote=Kronus]I clearly said worship the religion, and I clearly said centuries.\n Yes, okay. Is it then 2 centuries, 3 or what? What is the distance of time that a symbol ceases to be religious? It's another of your absurd off-the-cuff/throw-away statements that might superficially substitute for argument.\n What is the Kronus formula for this schema? You've painted yourself into this one too! :)\n \nI could ask you to prove that no one does this, but you'd fall back on the 'how do I prove a negative' which sort of opens the door for you to make such sweeping statements.\n\n \nYou've said that you're ignorant of American ways; I'm explaining them to you. If you're going to automatically disbelieve everything I say, than don't ask me.\n\n Nice straw-man. I almost laughed. I, at least am not ignorant of paganism, nor of the Christian symbols behind many of your icons. This still does not address the fact that in order to support your fallacy, you did an illogical search - applying the wrong methodology to this particular subject. That I would state that I don't know much about some other issues, seems to you to be an indication that I've said I don't know much about paganism, hence your desire here to the (almost) laughable tactic.\n \nBTW, the web site you linked to concerning the St. Andrews Cross is run by a self proclaimed racist, Charles Jennings, with ties to the KKK. I would not call him a reasonable person. Certainly not a person who's opinion I would base an argument on. http://www.rickross.com/reference/c...nidentity7.html \n\n Regardless, he is correct. I expect you'd not believe him, even if he told you the sky was blue. That was but one source. It's taken you till now to object to this, so I find your silence being acceptance, you've now changed your mind. Why indeed should I now re-post these, or further evidences when you simply refuse to back up your own claims (at all!) with anything other than your own opinion?\n Further to this you've still, despite numerous requests shown how the Constitutional laws relating to the establishment of a religion relate to the cross removal issue. You've badgered me for allegedly not responding to you, and I've answered you. The closest you've come is waved your hand in the direction of an earlier post which simply presents the law, and your own conclusion. The conclusion you state is not actually connected to the statement of law. A law regarding not establishing a law does not equate to the removal of a cross. You've yet to bridge that gap.\n Instead of being interested in presenting a genuine debate you are intent on making sweeping statements, not proving them, asking me to prove them etc. - or at least formulating a proof for an unprovable - that is the criticism of it, you make such statements that are a substitute for thought out argument\n You've also ignored the study of semitoics which shows quite clearly that the symbols of your courts are secular - or dominated by secular ones - the position of flags etc.",

I mean, either it's alright for them to be there or it's not. I understand that once it's been there for a while you may not want it to go away, but the fact that you'll miss it doesn't address there reasons that it shouldn't be there in the first place. If it should never have gone there, then the fact that someone did something wrong in the past doesn't mean you keep getting to do it wrong now.\n \n Here's a story I heard in the news recently. A woman who practices Wicca moved to a new town. She went to the town meeting, which was opened with a prayer to \"Jesus Christ, our lord and savior.\" The woman asked if they could change the prayer, use different words, rotate who says the prayer each week, not say a prayer at all. She was refused on each count, and harassed just for asking. She took the town to court on seperation of church and state grounds, and won. However, she received death threats, her house was vandalized, and her dog killed and butchered.\n \n These people liked their religious tradition, and didn't want to change it. However, it's simply wrong that in order to participate in local government she had to be told at every meeting that, in essence, her religious beliefs didn't matter. She offered reasonable compromises, which were refused. When she took perfectly reasonable legal action, they slaughtered her dog. Now, can you explain to me again why they're the ones who need protection? Or why, just because they had been doing it their way for so long, they were right to refuse to change?\n \n I'm getting a little emotional here. Sorry. I think it was your first two lines that set me off. No, being told you have to take your religious monument out of a government building would not make you feel the same way as being persecuted for trying to have your right to worship your own religion aknowledged. It would not make you feel the same way at all. It's the difference between feeling bad because you don't have everything, and feeling bad because you have nothing.",

Within a few years there may well be a few thousand Nova Romans... running real-world Classical-oriented businesses through the Ordo Equester, hosting public gatherings such as Roman Days, organizing Sodalicium (clubs) around Classical subjects concerning everything from Brewing to Philosophy, holding legal religious services, helping to fund serious archaeological digs, and even participating in real-world politics as an international \"Culture and People.\"\n Decades from now nobody is going to care that we as individuals were really superior store clerks, computer programmers, salespeople or whatever.

Both the household religion and the so-called state religion are vital to the Religio Romana, and both are represented in the practices of NOVA ROMA.

   "As shown above, there are active pagans in the world - some who promote the old Greco-Roman gods. Kronus is not willing to recognise them as following legitimate religious practices in order to further complicate his already oddly shaped discriminatory theory against one particular Christian-based symbol. The onus was on him to show his statement to be true, but he could not do this. I have shown it to be false - even though I need not have done so, but I wanted this debate to progress.\n \n He's against the removal of only one form of Cross, because the other forms, as they appear on flags etc. are not, according to him, religious anymore, even though there are still Christians, but because the context, of placing them on a flag removes their obvious religious symbolism. Oddly enough context does not affect 'the Cross'. It doesn't even come into the equation for him that they follow the same shape as 'the Cross' as exampled on the State flag of Hawaii... which has the red cross of St. George... which is '+' shaped (he's tried to focus on the 'X' shaped Cross of St.Andrew only).\n \n He stated some further ill-defined formula regarding the time between when a religious system ceases to have practitioners and when a symbol ceases to be religious. I've asked him now three times to detail this formula, and he's been remiss.\n \n Further to that, semiotics, or, the study of symbols (of which I admit only a cursory knowledge of - having only formally studied Sociology for 1 and a half years), comes into play. Symbols do have meanings. The positioning of a symbol is also meaningful. All the pictures I've seen of US court-houses show one symbol to be paramount; the flag of the United States. This is a clear indicator of the belief priorities of the people operating the courts. The court-houses I've seen, for the most part don't appear like churches. There would be few I'd imagine who, upon entering a building that doesn't look like a church, or function as a church, who's primary symbols are secular, would get a feeling of religious dominance - the only known exception is Kronus. He's also in a sense arguing against the common sense of most Americans who he'd believe would be totally confused upon entering a court - thinking it was some place of religious worship... because a cross in a court is not just a symbol of Christian reverence - it is a statement in a secular context that the United States has had a Christian influence. It is a recognition of this fact.\n \n In short, Kronus has presented some opinion on his belief that a particular cross should be removed. He's provided no proofs for his argument, believing in fact that all these should be provided by others. He's also not provided any reasonable connection between his citation of a law to do with the 'establishment' of a religion and the removal of one particular religious symbol; given the fact that the courts contain pagan and Christian-based symbols, they clearly aren't favouring ONE religion. It could be argued that they are favouring TWO religions, but this in not an argument he can successfully make, as the constitution doesn't cover this (from the little I've read)",

Therefore, by your own formula, the Roman religious symbols in the courts are still religious symbols. Given that knowledge you should have changed your own stance to embrace an objection to these too, but for some reason you've chose to be obstinate in refusing to recognise these as religious symbols - thus discrediting your stance - because as it turns out, you're only against the removal of one religious symbol, in the form of a cross. This then is your bias. Though you did try to change the focus by re-stating the constitution is against all religious symbols - this didn't matter because you don't believe these Greco-Roman symbols are religious, therefore aren't covered by the Constitution. Through the layers of deceit it lay - you're against one particular religious symbol, only. I have stated the reasons why I'd be disinclined to remove this symbol. You really have not shown a case for it's removal other than one based on ill-conceived bias. At the heart of your idea is an anti-Christian stance. I say this because the only symbol you're against is the only one you recognise as Christian. Every other one, pagan, or Christian (such as the Cross of St. Andrew, or even the Cross of St. George - which is the same shape as 'the Cross'), you've tried to work out a monstrous lump of exceptions to cover them with. This lump includes 'context'; if it's on a flag, it ceases to be religious. Even though context only applies to this particular symbol. Then you tried to re-work the history of it, or, to state that if many people are equally unaware as yourself, then it ceases to be religious. All these odd exceptions you've thrown up, but for some reason 'the Cross' never has them applied to it. It's the exception to your exceptions.\n \n I've also applied the study of semiotics, which is the study of signs and symbols. I expect you've never even heard of the word. Clearly, the positioning of symbols is itself symbolic. From this axiom, the pictures of your court-houses show which symbol is paramount. And it's a secular one!\n \n The odd thing is you persist with this theory, given a wealth of information discrediting it.\n \n This is what happens when people hold an irrational bias. No amount of evidence persuades them.",

   "I figured something like that would be your response, but I felt I had to try anyway.\n\n Your previous post was 'the set up'. And now you've delivered. Rather than actually answer any of my questions, you've gone for the emotional appeal - that you're just trying to help me. If I respond negatively, then you can do what you just stated, that you were only trying to help. It is a wicked tactic that bespeaks a lack of actual ability to argue your theory anymore... your attempts at rebuttal have all gone, and you now appeal to this lower denominator; transference.\n \n You believe you only gave me two options; not responding at all, or responding with further proofs - which here you don't actually feel any need to respond too, just an attempted ad hominem - in the form of someone obstinately refusing to accept your 'help'. As I stated, we operate on different levels of honesty. You would substitute that sort of tactic in order to get out of this mess you've left yourself in; based on the fact your theory was based on a premise that didn't even consider that there might be other religious symbols in courts.\n \n I still await you to answer my questions. But you'll probably now state that there's no point and add some blame on my part for your unwillingness to do so. That is in fact the crux of your last posts - now that you realise that your argument is up, you would transfer this upon me! It is not a good substitute for an argument as most people see this tactic of yours as a sign of lack of substance - again you seem to underestimate the intelligence of your fellow Americans.\n \n And so we are left debating the character of each other; though if you continued on this line, you'd be sure to say that I am the 'aggressor'.\n \n There is another option...\n If you had the genuine desire to debate, in an honest fashion, you'd re-introduce your idea, but include the religious symbols (plural), not just an attack on one. This too, is a 'set-up' post.\n You can either ignore it and not respond to any more of my posts on this issue (which is, going by your form, your favourite tactic), or state that it's my aggression/stubbornness that would prevent any meaningful dialogue. The opportunity for the later option awaits you, if you can actually answer my questions regarding\n a) your time-scale theory\n and/or\n b) your 'establishment of religion' equals banning, theory.\n \n I am eager to see how this plays out. :)",

   "Is it your contention that an interpretation of the 1st amendment requires such a ban? The constitution would seem to prohibit laws that coerce or compel religious observance. Does religous symbolism in the public square constitute such a law?\n\n \n Yup, this is based on the first amendment. The supreme court has ruled that not only can the government not write laws that influence religious observance, but also that the government cannot take actions that endorse one religion over another, or that endorse religion over non-religion.\n \n Here's a re-post of the ruling.\n \n \n \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\"\n \n I. ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE PRINCIPLES\n \n * The Constitution forbids not only state practices that \"aid one religion...or prefer one religion over another,\" but also those practices that \"aid all religions\" and thus endorse or prefer religion over nonreligion. Everson v. Board of Education of Ewing, 330 U.S. 1, 15 (1947).\n \n * In determining whether a particular practice violates the Establishment Clause, courts must apply the three-pronged test established by the Supreme Court in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971). Where the government's action fails any one of the following three prongs, it is unconstitutional:\n \n (1) whether the government's action has a secular purpose;\n (2) whether the primary effect is to advance or endorse religion, and\n (3) whether the policy or practice fosters an excessive entanglement between government and religion.\n \n \n So, as you can see, it's not just laws, but state actions that are constrained by the 1st amendment. Or, to be specific, by the Supreme Court's interpretaion of the Constistution.",

   "I don't really see that they're seperate issues. I mean, either it's alright for them to be there or it's not. I understand that once it's been there for a while you may not want it to go away, but the fact that you'll miss it doesn't address there reasons that it shouldn't be there in the first place. If it should never have gone there, then the fact that someone did something wrong in the past doesn't mean you keep getting to do it wrong now.\n \n Here's a story I heard in the news recently. A woman who practices Wicca moved to a new town. She went to the town meeting, which was opened with a prayer to \"Jesus Christ, our lord and savior.\" The woman asked if they could change the prayer, use different words, rotate who says the prayer each week, not say a prayer at all. She was refused on each count, and harassed just for asking. She took the town to court on seperation of church and state grounds, and won. However, she received death threats, her house was vandalized, and her dog killed and butchered.\n \n These people liked their religious tradition, and didn't want to change it. However, it's simply wrong that in order to participate in local government she had to be told at every meeting that, in essence, her religious beliefs didn't matter. She offered reasonable compromises, which were refused. When she took perfectly reasonable legal action, they slaughtered her dog. Now, can you explain to me again why they're the ones who need protection? Or why, just because they had been doing it their way for so long, they were right to refuse to change?\n \n I'm getting a little emotional here. Sorry. I think it was your first two lines that set me off. No, being told you have to take your religious monument out of a government building would not make you feel the same way as being persecuted for trying to have your right to worship your own religion aknowledged. It would not make you feel the same way at all. It's the difference between feeling bad because you don't have everything, and feeling bad because you have nothing.\n\n \n YOur point is well taken.",

Do you mind if I call you Monty?), glad you asked! In this context, a symbol would count as religious if it failed the tests supplied by the Supreme Court (see below). What we're concerned with here is the endorsement or advancement of religion (see #2). Thus, if a symbol would be seen by a reasonable person as endorsing a religion, it would count as a religious symbol. For example, a couple of thousand years ago, the Druids of Northern Europe considered the oak tree to be sacred. However, no reasonable person in America today would look at an oak tree on government property and consider it to be an endorsement for Druidism (?), so oak trees are not religious symbols in this context.\n \n \n\n Secondly, what law are you basing this belief on?

In this context, a symbol would count as religious if it failed the tests supplied by the Supreme Court (see below). What we're concerned with here is the endorsement or advancement of religion (see #2). Thus, if a symbol would be seen by a reasonable person as endorsing a religion, it would count as a religious symbol. For example, a couple of thousand years ago, the Druids of Northern Europe considered the oak tree to be sacred. However, no reasonable person in America today would look at an oak tree on government property and consider it to be an endorsement for Druidism (?), so oak trees are not religious symbols in this context.\n\n Here it is again, and please, enough with the smoke and mirrors.

You obviously feel that it is against the law. How is it that it is a law that is universally breached (according to your interpretation it is).

   "I combined your posts.\n Also, you touch on a some points a few times, so I may not have answered you until later in my response. You might want to read the whole thing before responding.\n \n\n Then the next step is why don't you think that they are religious symbols, when there are currently in the USA many practitioners of paganism, and some specifically worship Greco-Roman deities. I am happy to (re) post the sites. \n \n\n I'm going to have to ask you to be very specific about what you mean by pagan. In America, it mainly means one of two things. It either refers to a modern religious movement, based on a new-age naturalist philosophy, or it refers collectively to those who worshipped the old, generally pantheistic, religions way back when. Usually one specifies the region, as in Norse pagans, Greco-Roman pagans, Babylonain pagans, etc. Even though some neo-pagans do worship some ancient-pagan goddesses, the terms are not interchangeable. Which of these two meanings do you mean, or do you have a third? \n \n Also, you're refering to symbols, plural. Are you talking about something more than the statue of Justice?\n \n \n\n Sometimes I feel petty. You are in fact the only person I recall who's ever commented on them, my guess is that most people either a) haven't noticed, or b) don't know what they mean.\n \n\n I'd go with c) they didn't feel it was worth the effort to mention\n \n \n\n All the crosses - 'the Cross', the Cross of St. Andrew, the Cross of St. George etc are.\n \n\n Not in this country. The Court has ruled that the latin Cross is a religious symbol, wherever it is. I've looked in FindLaw and the ACLU sites, and have yet to find anyone claiming that the saltire(St. Andrews cross on a flag) is a religious symbol.\n \n \n \n\n I understand this, but your argument really rests on a few fallacies...\n a) one is the removal of any religiousness of several of the symbols found on government property - namely the pagan\n b) whether the cross, seen in conjunction with these other religious symbols means that the government is 'establishing a religion'.\n The cross is universally a Christian symbol. Nativity scenes are frowned upon by certain iconoclastic Christian groups.\n \n\n a) Please list all the symbols you're refering to. I believe the only one you've specified is the statue of Justice. As for her, all I can say is that no \"reasonable person\", to use the Court lingo, considers it to be a religious symbol. Not in this country anyway.\n b) I don't understand your objection. I don't see how displaying a cross can \n not be seen as establishing a religion. Perhaps it's the word \"establish\" that's the issue here. \n \n What the Court is trying to do here is allow everyone to chose for themselves what sort of religious life, if any, they will lead, without feeling any pressure what-so-ever from the government. The Court recognizes the power that symbols can have, and it is their opinion (and I agree) that having overtly religious symbols on government property can give the impression that the government is saying \"we like this religion.\"\n \n Does that clear it up?\n \n \n\n I see you example local government - but I thought that you gave examples of Federal Courts before. Please explain it you are producing examples of Federal violations of this law, or local.\n \n\n Um, yes. Let me give you a quick course in US civics, in case you're not familiar with how we do things.\n \n When it comes to law, the Constitution trumps everything, and the Supreme Court has the job of deciding if a law, local or federal, violates the Constitution. The Constitution itself does not actually contain any law, however. And the Supreme Court only gets to make rulings on cases that actually get brought before it. So, as a specific example, the mayor of some little town somewhere decides to put a Nativity scene in front of the town hall. Someone says \"you can't do that\", and sues to have it stopped. Assuming both sides care enough and keep appealing decisions made by the lower courts, the case works its way up the system until it reaches the Supreme Court. They then make a ruling one way or the other. In this case, they say that you can't put a Nativity scene in front of town hall. While their ruling isn't a law per se, it does affect all laws in the country. Thus, any local law that says you could put out a Nativity scene would be unconstitutional.\n \n \n\n I have yet to see your case as to why the roman-pagan based symbols aren't religious. (I say this if we work on the fiction that our debate only started a few posts ago).\n \n\n That is the fiction I'd like to maintain, yes. :)\n I'm just going to talk about Justice here. If you have other symbols in mind as well, say which ones you mean.\n Seperation of church and state is an issue of interest to me, which I've followed for quite some time. In all that time, I've never seen anyone refer to Justice as a religious symbol. Hardcore atheists who want \"In God we trust\" off the money have no issue with it. Hardcore Christians who say \"If you can't have a cross, you better not have anything else\" don't have a problem with it. I've checked FindLaw and the ACLU sites, and found no references to Justice as a religious icon. I don't think it's a religious symbol, I've never met anyone who claimed it was a religious symbol (aside from you). Now, this is a big country, with a diverse population. If you looked hard enough, you could probably find someone who worshipped anything you care to name. That's why the Supreme Court uses the \"reasonable person\" guideline. The reasonable people of this country don't consider the statue of Justice to be a religious symbol, and therefore, for the purposes of this discussion, it isn't.\n \n \n\n I disagree. I did 1 and 1/2 years of Sociology at university (though not a specialised course in Semiotics) and it was introduced that way. It is the meaning system we apply to symbols. Location of the symbol is itself meaningful. It is a recognition that they are part of language - in that they contain meaning - but it is not 'spoken', it is visual.\n The application of a 'religious' program by government - which you may suspect, seems to be going about this the wrong way, because from the pictures I've seen, the secular symbols of state take precedence.\n \n\n I don't have the link for this handy, but can track it down if you like. There was a case where a school displayed the 10 commandments, and even included a sign saying that the display was educational, and not religious. The Court ruled that religious symbols in a secular setting are still religious, even if given a label that says \"not religious, secular\". So, yes, in general the location of a symbol can change it's meaning. Taking a St. Andrews Cross out of the church and turning it into a saltire on a flag is a great example. However, more overtly religious symbols like the latin cross or the menorah have been ruled as being strictly religious, regardless of placement.\n \n P.S. Hope you liked Sim CIty.",

Although most of our Citizens are currently pagans of one ilk or another, and the public \"State\" religion of Nova Roma is the Religio Romana, we in no shape, matter, or form require Citizens to practice Roman Paganism. The one exception to this is our magistrates; because they are not only civil servants but also have functions within the Religio Romana, we ask that they at least be willing to fulfill those religious functions.

   "As I said, this is a diverse country, and you can find someone who will say anything. That's why we apply the \"reasonable person\" test. \n \n In the first case, if you look through the whole web site, you'll find that these people are wearing togas. They've named themselves things like Marcus Arelius. People don't do that in this country. There are really only two explanation. The first, which I believe, is that it's just an elaborate game they play. I did the same sort of thing in college, except I was a viking. The second option is that they're simply wackos. As I said, I'm going with choice one. In either case, the existence of this group in Maine is insufficient to raise the statue of Justice to a religious symbol. Neither the courts, nor the US people as a whole see the statue as religious. No one, seeing the statue, is going to feel their religious choices threatened, and that's the core of the matter.\n \n As for the Alabama flag, that site is written by a member of the KKK. That's Klu Klux Klan. I don't know if you're familiar with them, so let me give you a bit of histroy. They're a hate group. They hate blacks, jews, pretty much anyone who isn't a white christian. They used terror and murder to try to impose their will on people. Vigorous law inforcement has gotten them to tone down their methods, but their philosophy hasn't changed. They still hate, and will do or say anything they can get away with to advance their agenda. It's pretty much understood in this country that if you're on the same side of a debate as the KKK, then you've chosen the wrong side. If the only people who are saying something belong to the KKK, then you can be assured that it's wrong.\n \n You can also be assured that if an issue with religious overtones hasn't shown up in court, then it's not an issue in this country. We tend to be very litigious; going to court is how we settle things. We also take our religion very seriously, or at least alot of us do. If the ACLU and FindLaw have nothing to say on the issue, then it's not an issue.\n \n BTW, I don't find large chunks cut and pasted out of other websites to be particularly useful. All that does is let me decide what they are saying. I need to know what you think they are saying. It would be much more useful to me if you would emphasize the point you are trying to make and why you think a given site supports it, rather than just pasting a bunch of text and adding just a sentence of your own here or there saying why you think it's relevant.\n \n For that matter, what is your point here? You seem to be trying to establish the religious nature of the statue of Justice and the Alabama flag. To what end?",

That's why we apply the \"reasonable person\" test. \n \n In the first case, if you look through the whole web site, you'll find that these people are wearing togas. They've named themselves things like Marcus Arelius. People don't do that in this country. There are really only two explanation. The first, which I believe, is that it's just an elaborate game they play. I did the same sort of thing in college, except I was a viking. The second option is that they're simply wackos. As I said, I'm going with choice one. In either case, the existence of this group in Maine is insufficient to raise the statue of Justice to a religious symbol. Neither the courts, nor the US people as a whole see the statue as religious. No one, seeing the statue, is going to feel their religious choices threatened, and that's the core of the matter.\n \n As for the Alabama flag, that site is written by a member of the KKK. That's Klu Klux Klan. I don't know if you're familiar with them, so let me give you a bit of histroy. They're a hate group. They hate blacks, jews, pretty much anyone who isn't a white christian. They used terror and murder to try to impose their will on people. Vigorous law inforcement has gotten them to tone down their methods, but their philosophy hasn't changed. They still hate, and will do or say anything they can get away with to advance their agenda. It's pretty much understood in this country that if you're on the same side of a debate as the KKK, then you've chosen the wrong side. If the only people who are saying something belong to the KKK, then you can be assured that it's wrong.\n \n You can also be assured that if an issue with religious overtones hasn't shown up in court, then it's not an issue in this country. We tend to be very litigious; going to court is how we settle things. We also take our religion very seriously, or at least alot of us do. If the ACLU and FindLaw have nothing to say on the issue, then it's not an issue.\n \n BTW, I don't find large chunks cut and pasted out of other websites to be particularly useful. All that does is let me decide what they are saying. I need to know what you think they are saying. It would be much more useful to me if you would emphasize the point you are trying to make and why you think a given site supports it, rather than just pasting a bunch of text and adding just a sentence of your own here or there saying why you think it's relevant.\n \n For that matter, what is your point here? You seem to be trying to establish the religious nature of the statue of Justice and the Alabama flag. To what end?\n\n \n You attack the sense of people who are pagans. I don't agree with them, I don't even think that their religion is sensible - but it is a religion.\n \n The KKK is irrelevant to this debate. It is still unquestioned that the Cross of St.Andrew is religiously based which leads to you final question -to what ends?\n \n I am trying to convince you that these symbols are religious. At present all I see you wanting to do is to have ONE religious symbol removed.\n \n If you recognised these others as religious, AND THEN call for their removal, that is fine. But, when you say you want 'all religious symbols removed', and you mean 'the Cross' and not these other forms, then that is not a fair debate.",

Yes, a symbol can change meaning based on where it is, but it doesn't have to. Changing a symbol's location doesn't automatically change it's meaning.\n Symbols have no inherent meaning, right? They only mean what people agree they mean. The three symbols in a row 'S' 'U' 'N' only mean the bright thing in the sky because you and I agree that that is what they mean. In America, a red octagon means \"stop\". Move that to another country and it loses all meaning. However, move it anywhere inside America, and it still means stop, because that's what everyone in America has agreed it means. The saltire? As you say, it's secular, because that's the consensus that we've reached in this country. The latin Cross? In this country, it's symbolic of Christianity. No matter where you put it, it will be symbolic of Christianity, because that's the consensus we've reached in this country. That's the meaning for the symbols that we've agreed upon.

You don't want the statues of Justice removed, because you don't recognise them as religious.\n \n\n But the cross isn't normally found in a court, not in this country anyway. And I'm not restricting my argument to just one type of government building, but to government prooperty in general. You are correct that if, if, someone wanted to mount a cross in church, I would oppose it. If they wanted to mount a Star of David, I'd oppose it. Star and Crescent? Oppose. Any religious symbol, I'd oppose. And if anyone did try to mount any of those symbols, and I sued them in court, I'd win. If I tried to sue for the removal of Justice on seperation of church and state grounds, I'd almost certainly lose, because that statue is simple not considered religious by the \"reasonable people\" of this country. So, to summarize: yes, I want all religious symbols removed, not just the Cross, and no, I don't think Justice is religious.

   "\"At an absolute minimum, the Establishment Clause was intended to prohibit the federal government from declaring and financially supporting a national religion, such as existed in many other countries at the time of the nation's founding. It is far less clear whether the Establishment Clause was also intended to prevent the federal government from supporting Christianity in general. Proponents of a narrow interpretation of the clause point out that the same First Congress that proposed the Bill of Rights also opened its legislative day with prayer and voted to apportion federal dollars to establish Christian missions in the Indian lands. On the other hand, persons seeing a far broader meaning in the clause point to writings by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison suggesting the need to establish \"a wall of separation\" between church and state.\"\n http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/estabinto.htm\n \nA pagan is someone who believes in many gods.\n\n \n Er. That doesn't really differentiate between neo-pagans and the greco-romans of 2000 years ago. They really are quite distinct.\n\n You've walked into that one. State how they are quite distinct. Here's a clue - 'neo' means 'new'. Neo-pagans are those from a predominantly Christian society that have accepted (some might say regressed) beliefs previously widely abandoned. That is it, in a nutshell. The dogma of neo-pagans is not that different - except that they are aware of more gods and like pagans of old, accept them too.\n I don't even know why your pursuing this line of argument. The neo-pagan sites I gave show that they worship the pagan gods of old, and some are displayed in the courts.\n It wouldn't matter if I founded a religion just last year, created sacraments etc that were novel, and worshipped pagan gods of old - providing that I worshipped the goddess of Justice, I would circumvent your theory about these symbols not be religious - by the very fact that I worshipped them. To take it one step further, if my belief system worshipped the American flag, that would make it a religious symbol. That is logic. People worshipping/venerating something make it religious. I know you have a point somewhere, but how does it matter anyway which people are worshipping these symbols? They are still religious by the fact people are worshipping them.\n [quote=Montalban]It is a symbol that has a Christian heritage. I believe, like 'the Cross' you need to take into account its situational context. On a flag, it takes on secular meaning... just as 'the Cross' in a court is different from a cross in church. \n Ok, I think I see the problem here. Yes, a symbol can change meaning based on where it is, but it doesn't have to. Changing a symbol's location doesn't automatically change it's meaning.\n \nSymbols have no inherent meaning, right? They only mean what people agree they mean.\n\n No, a symbol by definition must have meaning. If it doesn't contain any meaning than it can't possibly be a symbol. What is different is that we may attribute different meanings to the same symbol.\n \nThe three symbols in a row 'S' 'U' 'N' only mean the bright thing in the sky because you and I agree that that is what they mean.\n\n The sun is a naturally occurring thing that some people have symbolised. That is, they believe that it represents something.\n \nIn America, a red octagon means \"stop\". Move that to another country and it loses all meaning. However, move it anywhere inside America, and it still means stop, because that's what everyone in America has agreed it means.\n\n Yes, if people attribute meaning to it, it is a symbol. It can't be a symbol unless there's meaning attached to it.\n \nThe saltire? As you say, it's secular, because that's the consensus that we've reached in this country. The Latin Cross? In this country, it's symbolic of Christianity. No matter where you put it, it will be symbolic of Christianity, because that's the consensus we've reached in this country. That's the meaning for the symbols that we've agreed upon. It's possible that in Australia you've decided on a different meaning for the symbol, one which changes based on location. We have not done that here. The Latin cross represents Christianity.\n\n A better argument.\n The Latin Cross as I said, in a court represents your Christian heritage, yes. It is not promoting a religion any more than the pagan statues are promoting paganism/neo-paganism. It is not saying \"Here I am, worship me\" BECAUSE it's not in a place of worship. It is, like the pagan symbols making a statement of reverence for the past.\n However, I see that if you place religious-only meaning to the cross this is why you believe it should be removed. For that is what symbols are about - meaning. It never occurred to me on entering this debate why you would be so adverse to it, given the fact that I know of the pagan heritage of the other symbols. It is a matter of education, only. That your educators have failed to instil the other meanings of the other symbols would remove any fears you or others might have that this is a way the church is trying to dominate you by stealth. To carry your argument further, then the placing of pagan statues in courts is also promoting religion - pagan ones. That this promotion is less successful because less people know about its history, is I feel your best argument... that if the pagan symbols loose their religious symbology to a majority of people then they cease to be religious. However, you argued that they lost their religious value because no-one worshipped those gods (at least as far as in America). And this is not the case. Given the current secularist trends it is only a matter of time before their religious meaning is re-known by more and more Americans. So, you're at a dilemma of arguing for the removal of one symbol, but not others. Now that you are aware of the religious meaning given to the other symbols, by people living in America it would be unfair of you not to acknowledge them as religious symbols. And just because they are pagan, doesn't imply that they are not right-thinking people.\n \nI apologise for phrasing this badly. Of all the religious-based symbols normally found in a court, you only want one removed... the Cross. You don't want the statues of Justice removed, because you don't recognise them as religious.\n \n \nBut the cross isn't normally found in a court, not in this country anyway.\n\n Yes it is. On the Bibles in courts, and on flags.\n \n And I'm not restricting my argument to just one type of government building, but to government property in general.\n\n So what other government buildings are crosses an issue in? If you have any sites with pictures it would be helpful so I can make a cursory semiotical examination of the context\n \nYou are correct that if,, someone wanted to mount a cross in church, I would oppose it. If they wanted to mount a Star of David, I'd oppose it. Star and Crescent? Oppose. Any religious symbol, I'd oppose. And if anyone did try to mount any of those symbols, and I sued them in court, I'd win.

If I decided that I wanted to worship bricks, we'd have to tear down all the old court houses and replace them with concrete. No. \n \n Just because you decide a symbol has religious meaning, doesn't mean it does have religious meaning. Symbols only have a meaning if that meaning is agreed upon. You can believe a symbol means anything you like in your own head, but if no one else agrees with you then the symbol does not carry that meaning. The agreed upon symbolic meaning for the statues of Justice is the concept of Justice. That's what it means here, because that's what we've agreed on. If some people want to attach other meanings they're free to, but that doesn't mean that those meanings get imposed on everyone else.\n \n\n \n I agree but would like to add a little to that. The whole reason crosses should be removed from public places is because it makes people of other religions feel that the government is favoring that religion. I know I feel that way when I'm forced to hear the pledge every day, the government telling me we are under god. Obviously, no Christian would object to putting crosses in public places because they wouldn't feel that way. So the reason it isn't allowed is for the other people who don't like it when the government says that a religion is the right one.\n \n In terms of Pagans it doesn't matter how many Pagans believe what they do, it matters what non-Pagans think when they see it. When a non-Pagan looks at it they think of justice, not that the government is saying their religion is right. When I and others see the cross on government property it's just one more way the government is favoring Christians where we are supposed to have separation of church and state.",

Are you of the opinion that if non-pagans were to \"feel\" that the gov't was promoting a pagan religion that such symbols should be removed?

But often people are threatened by force to be religious. There was a case recently where a kid in Alabama public school was forced to stand and recite the pledge. When he/she (can't remember which) refused to say it, still stood, they were suspended. This definately constitutes as force.\n \n As this relates to the current debate, this would just be a stepping stone for turning this into a Christian nation. Even in this debate, people have tried to claim that we are a Christian nation because of the \"in god we trust\" and the fact that the majority is Christian. Putting crosses up is not physically forcing you to be religious, but it IS sending a message that the government is saying that Christianity is better because it gets a symbol on government property.\n \n The site of the cross is attached to religion. People regard it as a Christian symbol, and when they see it in a public place, the government is favoring a religion over another and non-religion.

   "I don't even know why your pursuing this line of argument. The neo-pagan sites I gave show that they worship the pagan gods of old, and some are displayed in the courts.\n\n To take it one step further, if my belief system worshipped the American flag, that would make it a religious symbol. That is logic. People worshipping/venerating something make it religious. I know you have a point somewhere, but how does it matter anyway which people are worshipping these symbols? They are still religious by the fact people are worshipping them.\n \n So, by your logic, if I started worshipping grass, we'd have to pave over the lawns in front of all the town halls? If I decided that I wanted to worship bricks, we'd have to tear down all the old court houses and replace them with concrete. No.\n\n Hang on, there's massive assumptions here.\n One is, you assume to tell what people can legitimately worship. Your government is, supposedly about not regulating issues about religion, but here you are telling people \"You're not a religion if you worship 'X'\"\n Secondly, the covering of lawns in front of town halls would be your solution, not mine, as I stated consistently, I have no problem with all religious based symbols in courthouses at present. You do, so that would be a problem you'd have to solve, based on your own ideas.\n \nJust because you decide a symbol has religious meaning, doesn't mean it does have religious meaning. Symbols only have a meaning if that meaning is agreed upon. You can believe a symbol means anything you like in your own head, but if no one else agrees with you then the symbol does not carry that meaning.

If some people want to attach other meanings they're free to, but that doesn't mean that those meanings get imposed on everyone else.\n\n Here you're trying for straw-man. I am not determining what people should or shouldn't worship. You are... but then you're not either, because you use the 'reasonable person' hypothesis to disenfranchise religions based on things that you consider nonsense.\n \n No, a symbol by definition must have meaning. If it doesn't contain any meaning than it can't possibly be a symbol. What is different is that we may attribute different meanings to the same symbol.\n\n \nPlease read my posts more carefully. I said inherent meaning.\n\n You said\n \nSymbols have no inherent meaning, right?\n\n in\u00b7her\u00b7ent P Pronunciation Key (n-h\u00eernt, -hr-)\n adj. \n Existing as an essential constituent or characteristic; intrinsic.\n http://dictionary.reference.com/search?r=2&q=inherent\n If it doesn't have meaning, it can't be a symbol. It is the nature of a symbol that it has meaning.... even if you don't know what it means. I can look at a book in a foreign language, not be able to understand it, but still recognise that it contains meaning.\n Seeing a statue outside a courthouse, you don't need to know what it symbolises, to know that it symbolises something. You know it has meaning, even if you don't know what the meaning is. The statues of the goddess are symbols. They are religious symbols, even if you don't recognise them, because the people who put them there know. I know. People passing on the streets might stop and wonder what's a statue represent, but knowing that they continually appear outside courthouses people would understand that they have symbolic value.\n \nHowever, I see that if you place religious-only meaning to the cross this is why you believe it should be removed.\n\n \nNot just me. That is the agreed upon meaning for that symbol in this country.\n This is the crucial point which you have to understand.\n\n Again this is due to lack of education. People passing in the street, I dare say would recognise the symbolic nature of the statues. At their core, they are symbolic. The question is, as you say, dependent upon the level of education of people. You continue however, despite the education, to deny their religious value.\n \nSo what other government buildings are crosses an issue in? If you have any sites with pictures it would be helpful so I can make a cursory semiotical examination of the context\n\n \n You can't look at a picture of an American building and make a cursory semiotical examination of the context. All you could say is what an Australian would make of the symbols. You don't have the background needed to figure how an American would interpret the symbols.\n\n Actually only the reverse would be true insofar as many Americans have but a superficial understanding of Australian culture, at best. We in Australia are inundated with American culture in all its forms. I have studied American history. I speak to Americans that I have worked with, work with etc. I e-mail with one of the posters on this forum. I e-mail someone I've worked with. I also have an understanding of semiotics.\n \nLeft alone, I concede that this absurd ruling would massively devastate my argument. Although a lower court ruled in favour of the State, your Supreme Court is superior. I call this absurd, because if you have a picture of a past president in your class-rooms, this must surely be seen as favouring the establishment of a particular political party or an endorsement of his regime (- though that's probably not in your constitution) based on the same logic that the Supreme Court made. However, they are your referees, not mine.\n\n \nBy calling the ruling absurd you are again showing that you don't understand how strongly Americans take their religion. There is simply no comparison between the 10 Commandments and a picture of Taft.\n\n That's a nice rhetorical ploy \"you just don't understand us\". It doesn't do you justice. As I said, if left alone this argument of yours would be compelling. That is why I drew upon other American sources.\n Why do you think that displaying two different pictures equates to only one of them being an endorsement?\n \nIt also makes me wonder about why your government allows tax exemptions to religious institutions.... that is by far a more substantive form of 'establishment'.\n\n \nTaxation is a classic way for government to exert control over something, that's why we don't tax religious institutions.\n\n That's not what the cite I gave suggests.\n [quote=Montalban]However, getting back to the Supreme Court an earlier court ruling\n U.S. Supreme Court \n EVERSON v. BOARD OF EDUCATION OF EWING TP., 330 U.S. 1 (1947) 330 U.S. 1 \n Argued Nov. 20, 1946. \n Decided Feb. 10, 1947.\n http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scrip...vol=330&invol=1\n Changed the wording of your constitution! It changed it from 'the Congress' to 'the state'.\n \"A 1943 Supreme Court decision applied the Fourteenth Amendment to the First Amendment Establishment Clause. In 1947 a Supreme Court decision (Everson v. Board of Education of Ewing TP), citing the earlier case, inserted the word \"State\" in place of \"Congress\", redefining the law.\n It read: \"..a state 'shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion...' \"\n If there is a valid legal explanation for the verbatim substitution, the resultant was neither the intent of First Amendment nor Fourteenth Amendment authors. The Supreme Court effectively usurped the authority of the people by writing new law prohibiting the free exercise of religion, something that is expressly forbidden of Congress by the Constitution.\"\n http://www.liberty-ca.org/articles/...ment_clause.htm\n \nThey didn't change the wording of the Constitution. \n All they were saying is that state law has to follow the US Constitution just like federal law.\n\n You are correct. A better phrasing would have been \"they changed how the Constitution should be interpreted\".\n \n You mentioned earlier that you would support the removal of crosses and other religious symbols from Federal land. Does this include cemeteries and war memorials? I do no know this to be a fact, but I would hazard to guess that Arlington cemetery is owned by the national government, and contains literally 100,000s of religious symbols.\n\n \nCemeteries would be an obvious exception. People get to put whatever religious symbols their religions require on their graves. The public parts of the cemetery, like the front gates, shouldn't carry symbols specific to any one religion, however.\n\n Why do they have an exception? It is\n a) Federal\n b) open to the public\n Just saying that they should doesn't say why they should.\n I think I have found another chink in your argument. Why should non-Christians, entering the cemeteries have to be reminded about the number of Christians who died for a secular cause?\n \nAlso I should like to draw your attention to the 'test' you continually cite.\n http://www.dudleyandsmith.com/wsbge.html\n It seems it's not used anymore. \n\n \n Actually, if you read to the end of the article you linked, it doesn't say that it isn't being used, but is in a state of modification, or possible replacement. I found the endorsement vs. coercion section particularly interesting. Good article.\n\n I stand corrected again. I should have said \"It's not used anymore in the form that you put forward\".",

You can't just educate people until the understand the \"correct\" meaning of a symbol.

They could have called it a 'house of representatives' but that doesn't mean that they owe all allegiance to this and not 'the' lower house of Congress.\n But you mock them simply because they dress up. You are again, although more subtly, imposing your values on how they should worship. I have already cited enough of their sites to say that they themselves DO worship pagan gods. Whether they do it one day a week, or every waking moment, it is still their religion.\n And Orthodox Christians take 'names' upon entering the church - most often names of saints. So if you go to Japan, to the Orthodox Church there, you'll find someone who's Japanese who's got a name \"Constantine\". Timothy Ware, the famous Orthodox writer writes under his Orthodox name \"Kallistos Ware\".\n My priest wears vestments for service - special clothes for the occasion. Even the parishioners dress in their 'Sunday Best'. An adult, being baptised will wear special white clothes. Leaving your value-ridden statements aside, these pagans do worship pagan gods.\n Oh, and my church has a 'council' but it doesn't compete with local government.\n \nActually only the reverse would be true insofar as many Americans have but a superficial understanding of Australian culture, at best.

But yes, it can gain and lose meanings. A cross in a Church has little secular meaning. A cross on a flag does.\n Look at modern art. You go into a contemporary exhibition, and you might see a stop sign. That's it! That's the art! It has taken on other values, because of where it is located. The classic example is Andy Warhol's Campbell's Soup picture. It represents both the soup, the company that made, and as a statement on pop culture - evoking memories perhaps of cold winter mornings.\n \nYou have persistently applied your meanings to symbols here in America, \n\n No. I have shown you the history behind the St.Andrew's cross, and the pagan symbols.\n \nand have called American interpretations absurd.\n\n I called an interpretation of and application of a law absurd (see below)\n \nYou have repeatedly refused to accept that Americans interpret symbols differently than you, and claim that if we just knew enough we would think like you do.\n\n This is most hilarious. You have in effect made yourself the spokesman for American interpretation. Because I disagree with you, I disagree with \"AMERICA\".\n Odd that you should make claims to the sanity of those who dress up differently than you do.\n \nThat's not the way it works. You can't just educate people until the understand the \"correct\" meaning of a symbol. Symbols have unique meanings which change from culture to culture, with none of them being more correct than any other. Until you understand that, you aren't qualified to render an opinion on symbols in other countries.\n\n It is true that symbols meanings do change; that's what I've been arguing. A cross in a secular context has meanings other than just religions ones.\n However, what do you think the statue of Justice represents? You claim to speak on behalf of all America, so what does it mean to you?\n \nThat's a nice rhetorical ploy \"you just don't understand us\". It doesn't do you justice. As I said, if left alone this argument of yours would be compelling. That is why I drew upon other American sources. Why do you think that displaying two different pictures equates to only one of them being an endorsement?\n\n \nSince only endorsement of religion is a problem, I don't see what you're getting at. Trying to draw a comparison between hanging up religious icons and hanging up a portrait of a president in a school is beyond my comprehension. Are you sure you aren't just punting here, desperately trying to find some distraction from my \"compelling\" argument? Because what you're saying really makes no sense to me at all. \n\n Not at all. In a class-room one would expect to find many symbols to remind students about their country. Some pictures of presidents, a flag, a map of the nation, some great hero or event. Maybe the constitution. Into this someone wanted to add the 10 Commandments and place on it a note contextualising it. Out of all these symbols one is deemed to be an endorsement of a particular set of values and you believe that the others are not symbolising any values. That one is religious, and because it is religious, this seems to be the problem. I accept that you and other Americans might not want to be reminded of religion, but it is naive to not believe that the other symbols don't 'symbolise' things too.\n Odd too, 'cause if you ask a child \"What does the flag represent\" they will most likely give you a whole list of values that American schools try to instil. Same with a picture of Abe Lincoln. You might get a reply that he stood for certain ideals.\n So as I stated, I can understand that you might want the more obviously religious symbol removed, but to deny that the other's don't convey meanings too, does seem to me to be absurd.\n Education is a process of socialisation. That too, I recognise is probably actually an argument for why they wanted it removed - people didn't want kids to pick up any nasty Judeo-Christian ideas by being exposed to such symbols.\n \nWhy do they have an exception? It is\n a) Federal\n b) open to the public\n Just saying that they should doesn't say why they should.\n I think I have found another chink in your argument. Why should non-Christians, entering the cemeteries have to be reminded about the number of Christians who died for a secular cause?\n\n \nI find it hard to believe that you could have read anything I've posted and still say this. The American people are, by and large, very religious.\n And that's fine, it's not a fact we're trying to hide. What possible reason would we have to hide the religion of our fallen soldiers? The American people can be as religious as they want to be, it's the American government that should stay out of religion. This is a point I've tried to make several times.\n\n No, you said you wanted all religious symbols removed from federal property. You stated this absolutely, and have quoted court cases you believe make this case.\n As stated, your argument is highly sinuous in its application.\n Of all the symbols on federal property you say you want religious symbols removed.\n But only ones that you know to be religious, and only when not in a context such as a flag, or on a Bible.\n But only when that property is not a cemetery - but here you make exceptions too, such as 'not on the gates' etc.\n Your tax funds must be paying for the grave-stones, their upkeep etc. That is federal funding going to particular religious reasons.\n Are the soldiers interred at government expense, with a government paid religious person presiding? What is secular about the ceremony he/she engages in on Federal land when a soldier is buried? Is the national flag present, combining the sense of nation with Christian (or other) sacrifice?\n But why not the gate?",

When I studied sociology, included in it was the general study of semiotics - though there was a specialised course for 3rd year - which I've already admitted I did not do. However many of the modern theorists in sociology are American. And I studied them. It is a straw-man par excellence to suggest this 'you don't understand us'. My father is American. American blood courses through these veins. I'm inundated by American culture. I don't 'qualify' as an American in the sense I don't have citizenship (I'm quite happy being Australian).\n b) I mentioned several crosses, not just the cross of St. Andrew - recall the flag of the state of Hawaii which has three crosses, including most prominently the Cross of St.George. I made this quite specific, going into detail abou the flag, the different crosses (there are 3), and so on. I also mentioned the Navy Cross which is not on a flag. It is in the shape of a Latin Cross, and by your own definition above - that a Latin Cross is religious no matter where, then it too is religious! Unless you are willing to make more exceptions to your exceptions.\n c) if you accept that it is a religious symbol no matter where, then you've completely become unravelled by the fact you accept crosses on federal land - such as cemeteries.. (re-edit - having read your change of course I direct you to this fact...)\n In another context, when it's burnt, it becomes a symbol of hate.\n \"The burning cross is a symbol of hate, one that is inextricably linked to this nation's racist and segregationist past.

Now that you have adjusted your position regarding religious symbols to exclude federal cemeteries, can I ask two things\n a) why?\n b) are there any other exceptions you'd be willing to make?\n Also consider the implications of this story before responding\n http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A26255-2004Jun8.html\n \n Conversely, your 'national symol' the bald eagle, might be regarded as solely secular but it can be used as a religious symbol by native americans.

No course did I fail at this particular attempt at a BA.\n \nIt is a straw-man par excellence to suggest this 'you don't understand us'. \n\n \nYou don't actually understand what the term \"straw-man\" means, do you? A straw-man is a debating technique whereby you present an argument in favour of your opponents view, only to immediately tear it down. \"You don't know what you're talking about\" is simply an accusation.\n\n Actually I believe here we're both wrong you on this statement of the absolute value of 'straw-man' and me on the specific application of it in this particular instance.\n strawman n\n 2: a weak or sham argument set up to be easily refuted\n http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=straw-man\n But you do use make use of straw-man later on.\n \nMy father is American. American blood courses through these veins.\n\n \n Unless you're claiming that the ability to understand symbols in genetic, I don't see how this is relevant.\n\n You argue that I don't understand Americans simply by being absent from America. I put forward a number of ways in which I garner information.\n a) cultural infiltration\n b) family and friends\n c) reading\n d) studying American sociologists\n etc.\n As stated, the fact that Americans are on this forum in disagreement with you, should alone refute your statement. But you condemn them all later on, and I'll deal with that then. In fact this has now become the bulk of your argument, to refute my ability to understand the situation.\n \nIn another context, when it's burnt, it becomes a symbol of hate.\n\n \nYes, of course. And when it's upside down it's satanic. Now that we've stated the obvious, may we continue?\n\n A 'symbol of hate' is not 'religious'. You stated another absolute, that no matter which context the Latin Cross was in, it was always representative of Christianity. Now you flip over on this and admit if it's inversed it's taken on the meaning of the anti-thesis of Christianity.\n If you would actually keep to a statement it would be easier to follow.\n You did state that on a flag, you'll say it has no religious meaning, but then I gave you another example, the Navy Cross. You said no matter where 'the Latin Cross' appears (excepting flags) it's religious.\n Now you add to this bag of exceptions if the cross is burnt by the KKK, or if it's inverted.\n You didn't even attempt to retort the Navy Cross cross. Is this an exception too? As such your 'general rule' of the religious symbology of Crosses has so many exceptions that it would be hard for you to use it as a rule anymore.\n \n This is refuted by the fact that Americans DO NOT agree with you here on these posts. And yes, I do understand that you claim to speak for all Americans, but that is different from me actually accepting that you can speak for all Americans.\n\n \nMy position is supported by the ACLU and FindLaw. Your position is supported by a bunch of role players and the KKK.\n\n Now that is straw-man. You have insulted everyone who is American who disagrees with you. There are several on this forum and you've labelled them as extremists by making an analogy to extremist organs such as the KKK.\n \nHow does she 'represent justice'?\n\n \nI'm really dumbfounded here. Truly.\n\n I believe you\n \nWe've been doing nothing but discussing symbology here for post after post and you ask how the statue of Justice can represent justice. That's just unbelievable.\n\n I understand how I understand it to be 'so'. Because it is based on the goddess of justice. That is why they chose the statue in the first place. Because it was representative of the ancient goddess of justice. But you who want to state that it 'might' have been religious several centuries ago has lost it's religious symbolism, so as a statue of 'justice' is must be a wholly secular representation of justice. So, how to you does it represent justice? You reply 'it just does'.\n \n The very fact that you want to remove one symbol instead of others, even back in the old courthouse is pertinent. It is the very debate you made when you said that you wanted religious symbols removed from federal property. You differentiate. It is quite within the realms of logic to explore 'why?'\n Likewise, if you deny a religious symbol - such as the pagan statues of Justice, have actual religious symbols, I'm entitled to ask questions regarding about how you regard symbols per se.\n\n \nNot really. Whether or not Justice is a religious symbol is at least somewhat relevant to the discussion, but the symbology of presidential portraits is completely irrelevant. You're still punting.\n\n You've made a just-so argument. Further you now need to explain how the 'symbol of justice' which you're repeated your claim that it's areligious, is representative of 'justice'.\n \nNow that you have adjusted your position regarding religious symbols to exclude federal cemeteries, can I ask two things\n a) why?\n b) are there any other exceptions you'd be willing to make?\n Also consider the implications of this story before responding\n http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dy...5-2004Jun8.html \n\n \n\n a) I explained before. Here's a direct cut and paste:\n Quote:\n The American people are, by and large, very religious.\n And that's fine, it's not a fact we're trying to hide. What possible reason would we have to hide the religion of our fallen soldiers? The American people can be as religious as they want to be, it's the American government that should stay out of religion. This is a point I've tried to make several times. \n\n So, you have another 'just-so'. You had an absolute statement\n no religious symbols on federal land\n Now you agree to an exception in this instance (federal cemeteries) based on the fact that Americans are by and large religious people. How does that 'exemption' then not apply to other federal land? The people are still religious.\n \n b) I'm always willing to change my mind if I'm presented with a compelling argument.\n\n That's not what I asked. I wanted you to tell me of any other exceptions. Please state these upfront, given your vast knowledge of America, Americans, and what people already accept.\n \nAs for your link, it sounds more like something I would cite:\n Quote:\n Eliasberg scoffed at the government's argument that the site is a war memorial. \"That doesn't honor Muslim veterans, Jewish veterans, atheist veterans or agnostic veterans,\" Eliasberg said. \"It's a preeminent symbol of a religion. If we want to have a war memorial on federal land, the government certainly knows how to do that without using a divisive sectarian religious symbol.\" \n\n Yes, I understand that. But what was of concern was that even when they attempted to sell the land upon which the cross stood, to private hands, the judge ruled that the land might one day possibly revert to the nation. So, even though it wasn't currently in breach of the law - it might one day be. Another strange working of the principles of law.\n \nIf you think this supports your position somehow, then the difference you've missed is that a gravestone clearly only represents the person in the grave, while a memorial like the one mentioned is supposed to represent all veterans.\n\n No that's not wholly true. The tomb to the unknown does in fact contain a person (or sometimes more) in it. Rather than just say \"To he/she who gave his/her life to the nation\" they assume that the person is religious. There is a very good chance that he/she was, but is that still right for them to make such an assumption. Obviously we have to add yet another exception to your rules. If it represents 'all' veterans then how does mentioning God represent all veterans who were atheistic?\n I read one case where a town council put the symbol of the fish on their logo. And a wiccan resident claimed that, even though the majority of the town were Christian, she felt that this symbol made her feel excluded.\n \n So, a new summary of your ever-more complex argument is;\n You state that a cross is a religious symbol always, but then only if it's the Latin Cross.\n You state the Latin Cross is Christian in meaning always, and no matter what context it's in; but then excepting on flags, when it's inverted, on fire, etc. (probably on medals too; the list of exceptions you'll make is not yet even tapped :)).\n You state that religious symbols should be removed from federal land, but you exempt cemeteries, but not their gates (!?!) (an exception to an exception!)\n You state that even though most Americans are religious you're happy with the inclusion of God on the tomb of the unknown, because perhaps this person was a theist to?\n As I've maintained all along, in effect what your argument is isn't about the separation of church and state, but the removal of Christian symbols from particular buildings because of your own aversion to them.\n ADDENDUM\n Just a thought...\n When your builders thought to add a symbol to the court to represent justice did they just make one out of air? No! They used the pagan goddess because she has always stood as a symbol of justice - based on the fact she's the goddess of justice. But you remove the religious base from this idea and still try to say 'she just represents justice'. Did they have a competition and ask people what type of symbol do they want on courts to represent justice? Or, did they go to antiquity because the pagan goddess has always represented justice, because she's the goddess of justice? That is, they chose a symbol because oddly enough it has always symbolised justice because that particular goddess has always symbolised justice!",

   " if you accept that it is a religious symbol no matter where, then you've completely become unravelled by the fact you accept crosses on federal land - such as cemeteries.. (re-edit - having read your change of course I direct you to this fact...)\n In another context, when it's burnt, it becomes a symbol of hate.\n \"The burning cross is a symbol of hate, one that is inextricably linked to this nation's racist and segregationist past. In upholding Virginia's statute, the Supreme Court rightfully recognizes that the government has the clear power to outlaw the use of this particularly hateful symbol when the intent is to intimidate or threaten another person.\"\n http://www.adl.org/PresRele/SupremeCourt_33/4249_33.asp\n Would you recognise here that context changes meaning?\n\n \n\n It's because it's intimidating. The law here is you can't do anything like that that's meant to be intimidating. It's not JUST because it's a cross. You can't burn down their house either but you don't go claiming that the house changes meaning, do you?\n\n That's the exact argument I made! Kronus stated an absolute, that the Latin Cross represents Christianity, all the time. BUT when it's in a different context, it can have another meaning. It is contextualised.\n I'm not aware of a burning house as a religious symbol.\n [quote=Montalban]Reasonable people? What a straw-man. Maximus was not suggesting that the name of the city equates to the federal government supporting religion. He was pointing out the religious origins of the name of the city. You have no problem with a government - in this case local, having 'City of Angels' as it's title. And he's got in response\n a) Golly, I never knew that's what it means (a paraphrase )\n b) it's too late to change it.\n \nFirst of all, I never said it was too late to change it,\n\n Kronus says it.\n \nand if you went up to a million people that didn't have Christian backgrounds like you do (they wouldn't be offended by a city having Christian roots) I bet not one would know that Los Angeles had anything to do with Christianity.\n\n Although I don't need the money, that's a sure bet I'd be willing to take. How are you going to go about proving it?\n \nThey're the ones who would object, and since they don't, that's what he meant by reasonable person.\n\n He used the 'reasonable person' in the context of people who worship pagan gods.\n \nYou said this. What I added is that it is paid for by the Fed government. It is a poor tactic to ignore most of the facts presented.\n\n \nYou agreed with it though and was the part that you may not have said explicitly, but that the stone is still the property of the person.\n\n We both agree that the stone is private. You can't contest a fact that we're agreed to! But what I suggested is you ignored all the other facts; its paid for by the government, its upkeep is paid for by the government, its administered by the government.\n \n Again? What part of the notion that the Fed government is paying for it all escapes you? If you want to be buried according to your 'private wishes' as you say, why are you in favour of the fed government paying for it?\n\n \nBut this isn't discriminating either. If someone in the military wants another symbol to be on the stone he's buried at, I think they would pay for that too. This isn't discriminating.\n\n But you're the one wanting separation of church and state; it's not about discrimination, your argument up to this point.\n \nSo? They do it! \n\n \nSo I have to agree with it??? We should have debated that way during the civil war. Don't argue for stopping slavery. So what if you disagree? They do it! I disagree with putting crosses on federal property and I disagree with burying an unknown soldier with a reference to god.\n\n You repeat an absolute again, which I thought you'd made exceptions too. See 'federal property' in your own statement. You didn't qualify it. Have you changed you mind on cemeteries?",

Yes, for something to be a symbol, it must by defintion have meaning. However, the specific meaning is not a function of the symbol. It isn't inherent to the symbol. For example, the letter S with a vertical line through it, $, symbolizes a dollar. It didn't have to though. There's nothing inherent to a dollar that would require it to be symbolized by $, nor is there anything inherent in the pattern $ that says it would have to symbolize a dollar. The dollar could have been symbolized by a D with a line through it, $ could have meant Saturday.\n \n You can trace the history of how symbols got there meaning, and in fact you have.

If you feel insulted by my pointing out that you site the KKK, then I'm sorry, but the fact is that you did, and they are the only source you've sited to back up your claim that the saltire should be considered religious.\n\n That is exactly what you did. You re-constructed my evidence to suggest that it's no one by crack-pots that supports my stance! However, you wanted more sources, by implication of your argument, so I gave these above.\n \n I understand how I understand it to be 'so'. Because it is based on the goddess of justice. That is why they chose the statue in the first place. Because it was representative of the ancient goddess of justice. But you who want to state that it 'might' have been religious several centuries ago has lost it's religious symbolism, so as a statue of 'justice' is must be a wholly secular representation of justice. So, how to you does it represent justice? You reply 'it just does'.\n\n \nIt represents justice because when little kids point to it and say \"What's that?\", their parents say \"That's Justice, it represents justice.\" It represents justice because when it shows up on the news the broadcasters say, \"this statue, which represents justice...\" \n\n SO, it just 'does'.\n \nThis is the point I was trying to get to about \"inherent\" meaning, which I guess I have to return to now. Yes, for something to be a symbol, it must by definition have meaning. However, the specific meaning is not a function of the symbol. It isn't inherent to the symbol. For example, the letter S with a vertical line through it, $, symbolizes a dollar. It didn't have to though. There's nothing inherent to a dollar that would require it to be symbolized by $, nor is there anything inherent in the pattern $ that says it would have to symbolize a dollar. The dollar could have been symbolized by a D with a line through it, $ could have meant Saturday.\n\n That's not true. You're suggesting here that people just arbitrarily picked a $ and assigned meaning to it....as you do with the justice symbol - that it has no history, it 'just does' represent something.\n \nYou can trace the history of how symbols got there meaning, and in fact you have. In the end though, symbols mean what they mean because that's what people think they mean. It is, in point of fact, \"just so\".\n\n Then it's not 'just so'. There is a reason why.\n \nSo, you have another 'just-so'. You had an absolute statement\n no religious symbols on federal land Now you agree to an exception in this instance (federal cemeteries) based on the fact that Americans are by and large religious people. How does that 'exemption' then not apply to other federal land? The people are still religious.\n\n \nNo. Based on the fact that the people BURIED in the cemeteries are religious, not the American people that are still walking around.\n\n So, the right to abrogate your rule exists only to dead people?\n Why not 'on the gate'?\n \nThat's not what I asked. I wanted you to tell me of any other exceptions. Please state these upfront, given your vast knowledge of America, Americans, and what people already accept.\n\n \nOoh, sarcasm! That really makes me want to put a serious effort into answering your question!\n\n You don't want to answer, then this would make a good excuse. You make a habit of not answering my questions. Obviously you see trouble ahead.\n [quote=Montalban]So, a new summary of your ever-more complex argument is;\n You state that a cross is a religious symbol always, but then only if it's the Latin Cross.\n As I've maintained all along, in effect what your argument is isn't about the separation of church and state, but the removal of Christian symbols from particular buildings because of your own aversion to them.\n \nI'm going to stop you right here. I supplied a list of religious symbols, from many different religions, which I said shouldn't be used on federal lands\n\n \n (excepting cemeteries; but excepting 'the gates' - murkier and murkier)\n \n \n You've ignored this. Why? Because it refutes your point. For some reason you want to believe that I've singled out the Latin Cross, and even though I also wouldn't want the Star of David or a menorah. That's the only reason you persist in harping on Justice and saltires. You have this hope that if you can show that there is a religious symbols that I don't mind, than I do in fact have it in for the Latin Cross. That makes no sense at all. Since I have clearly, plainly, and repeatedly stated that I don't want to see Buddhist wheels or Islamic stars and crescents on federal land it's obvious I don't have it in for the Latin cross. All that the debate about Justice and saltires shows is that I don't think they're religious, \n\n They are religious. We've already been over your ever-changing arguments over Justice\n First it was\n You didn't know it's origins\n Then\n It's not currently religious in meaning -there were side debates here where you refuse to acknowledge religious practices of pagan people\n to now\n it 'just is' secular in meaning devoid of past, reason etc, it 'just is' because kids are taught by their parents\n \"While it goes by many names, the most popular are Lady Justice, Scales of Justice, and Blind Justice. The statue dates it origins from ancient Roman times as the lady represented is Themis, the goddess of justice and law. Well known for her clear sightedness, she typically holds a sword in one hand and scales in the other.\"\n http://www.statue.com/lady-justice-statues.html\n \nand you don't know how to make a logical point.\n\n Logic? You make absolute statements, then make exceptions, then exceptions to the exceptions. You've stated\n NO RELIGIOUS SYMBOLS (including the Latin Cross)\n then\n THE LATIN CROSS IS ALWAYS CHRISTIAN\n except\n when it's inverted, burnt, in the form of a decoration etc. The list goes on.\n \n \nDid you know that by virtue of you arguing against Kronus' position you don't understand the way Americans think! (Even though you are American)\n I argue against him, and on this thread he states that it's because I don't understand American culture. As you argue the same side as I and ipso facto, neither do you understand American culture; he has special insights. Unless his premise was incorrect. But that couldn't be!\n\n \n \nI haven't seen Maximus advance the notion that the Alabama flag is religious, or that people worship the statue Justice. And if he does, I suspect he'll back up the claim with something more than \"that's because you Americans don't know any history.\" \n\n See sites I gave above that refute your opinion of your knowledge of history\n \nAs you argue the same side as I and ipso facto, neither do you understand American culture; \n\n \nJust wanted to highlight this little logical gem. I say A is wrong, for reason X. I say B is wrong. Therefore, I must think it's wrong for reason X.\n\n That is the argument you in fact make. You make a 'just-so' statement about American culture, and if I argue against it, it's because I just don't understand American culture. Thank you for highlighting this as a 'gem'. I thought it was funny also.\n \n You didn't make a response to an earlier post so I re-print your exceptional 'rule'\n So far the statement regarding their 'rule' was\n No religious symbols should be on federal property\n \n But now is\n No religious symbols should be on federal property\n UNLESS\n they are pagan in origin even if they are currently still religiously significant\n they are a Cross (excepting anything but the Latin Cross) (evidentially an Orthodox Cross might be okay)\n (excepting Crosses on flags, even if they are a Latin Cross)\n or\n UNLESS\n in a cemetery (but not on the gate)\n or in a court, but on a bible.\n BECAUSE\n A religious symbol (meaning 'the Latin Cross') retains its Christian meaning no matter which context it's in\n EXCEPT\n if it's burnt at a KKK ceremony (as part of an act of intimidation) (-clause added by Zachvac)\n or inverted\n (or on an award -such as the Navy Cross)*\n (or on a military uniform - such as by chaplains)*\n (or a cross as worn/displayed by military and other medical staff)*\n and several others\n AND THAT IS BECAUSE\n the first amendment argues for the government not to support any particular religion\n EVEN THOUGH\n they make exemptions on religious grounds to\n conscientious objectors\n Native Americans making use of protected animals for their religious ceremonies\n Mormons not being allowed to practice polygamy\n and\n divers other exceptions such as the fact you are allowed holidays on religious days etc\n \n -Amen\n \n *-Exceptions have yet to be stated, but I'm waiting for confirmation.",

   "The Evolution of a Flag.\n \n The Florida State Flag has a Saltire, this is a term used for the Cross of St.Andrew.\n In the history of Florida, the Cross of St.Andrew has flown over the land in many forms...\n \"First Spanish Occupation 1565 - 1763\n The Burgundian saltire, or Cross of Burgundy, represented Spanish rule in Florida from 1565 to 1763. The X-shaped cross symbolized the rough branches of the trees on which Saint Andrew, the patron saint of Burgundy, was crucified. The flag was introduced into Spain by Philip I, Duke of Burgundy, and was later established as one of the country's banners by his son Charles1 I, in 1516.\n British Occupation 1763-1784\n The red Cross of St. George, the patron saint of England, was the major element of the British flag. In combination with the white Scottish Cross of St. Andrew, it formed the Union flag. This flag flew over Florida from 1763 until 1784.\n http://www.shgresources.com/fl/symbols/flag/\n \n The red cross added to the final form of the Florida flag was chosen because it represents the links to the past (stated above), and the Confederate Flag, which also contained the Cross of St.Andrew.\n \"The red diagonal cross was inspired by the Battle flag of the Confederate States of America, to which Florida belonged.\"\n http://www.anyflag.com/state/florida.htm\n \n \n \"The best-known of all Confederate flags?the battle flag?is often erroneously confused with the national flag of the Confederacy. The battle flag features the cross of St. Andrew (the apostle was martyred by being crucified on an X-shaped cross), and is commonly called the \"Southern Cross.\" A large degree of the Southern population was of Scottish and Scotch-Irish ancestry, and thus familiar with St. Andrew, the patron saint of Scotland. The stars represented the eleven states actually in the Confederacy, plus Kentucky and Missouri. This flag is the flap popularly associated with Robert E. Lee, and is the flag under which he fought.\"\n http://www.sonofthesouth.net/leefoundation/Confederate_Flag.htm",

   "Kronus,\n \nI'm less familiar with our national monuments than I should be, so I don't know specifically what you're refering to. I'm sure many of the ones you mention have inscriptions that mention God. The context in which God is mentioned is, I think, relevant. Is it a \"thou shall have no God before me\" type thing, or more of a \"we thank God for ...\" thing. The former I would say shouldn't be there, the later I can deal with. Are there any symbols on Federal buildings that are specific to one religion that you know of?\n\n Specific to one religion? Are you interested in only separating the Christian Church from the state or all other \"churches (religions)\" as well? Does the specificity of religion matter? Wouldn't any mention of a God be an imposition of a religious belief in the context of what we have seen in our country thus far? Why was there a case to remove the word \"God\" from the Pledge of Allegiance?\n \n Here are some links that list some of the examples of the symbols and writings:\n \n http://home.flash.net/~bob001/backgrnd.htm \n \n http://www.bgcworld.org/mag/0704bgc/3.pdf \n \n http://www.countypost.com/wordontheweb/paperpulpit/TheSymbolsOfANationsFaith.html \n \n \nWe judge the need based on their religiousness, we judge our actions based on practicality. I'd love it if everyone in the world had enough food to eat, but I can't buy them all dinner. There's also a cost/benefit analysis that needs to be considered (not in a literal sense of course). Getting a monument to the 10 commandments out of a courthouse is relatively straight forward, and has the immediate benefit of allowing non Judeo-Christians to feel that they can get justice in that court. Changing the name of L.A. would be a collosal undertaking, and would advance seperation of church and state marginally at best.\n\n So you are not in favor of a complete and absolute ban on Christian symbols, writings, and heritage in public buildings, government documents, and proceedings then? \n \n And I'm not sure how a Christian symbol in a courtroom would imply an unfairness and corruption of the court. Is that what you are saying? It might be just the opposite. A Christian judge would have an obligation to someone higher than man to be fair and just. He would be outside of the influence of man and more likely to be a good judge.\n \n If we change the name of Los Angeles it might not have a big impact on separation of church and state. But what if we change the name of Los Angeles, San Bernadino, San Francisco, San Fernando, San Diego, San Jose, Santa Ana, Santa Monica, Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz, St. Louis, St. Augustine, St. Paul, San Antonio, Corpus Christi, Santa Fe, South Padre Island, and San Jacinto?\n \n Then we can also outlaw St. Patrick's Day as a holiday since all of those celebrations and parades take place on public grounds.\n \n \nStarting a town with that name would send the message that it was a Christian only town, and that non-Christians weren't welcome.\n\n So are you saying that it would/should not be allowed? This is just an opinion and not grounded in law or constitution right?\n \n \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;\"\n \n Does the name Christianville imply an animosity or hostility to those who aren't Christian?",

As you said earlier, \"what's done is done?\" But going forward the practice of including these and symbols of other religions should not occur.\n \n\n More or less. I certainly don't want to destroy our national heritage, or tear down our monuments. On the other hand, if a violation had occurred only 20 years ago, and no one said anything until now, then that would be a valid complaint. I guess I'd take it on a case by case basis, weighing how bad a violation of church and state it was against the \"heritageness\" of it.\n \n \n \n\n Are the laws of this land based on Hindu influences or on influences by the 10 Commandments and others?\n \n\n Our laws are based on the concepts of fairness and justice, which we can attribute to many cultures. While the 10 commandments have had an influence, highlighting that influence over all others serves no usefull purpose, and is discriminatory to those who aren't from the Judeo-Christian tradition.\n \n \n \n\n And what if you are a Christian and you walk into a secular courtroom where the law to which you answer is not recognized? Would the law prefer atheists?\n \n\n Regardless of your faith, if your religion says one thing and the law says another, your supposed to follow the secular law. You don't want people getting away with murder because their religion calls for human sacrifice, right? As for what the law prefers, it's not supposed to have any preference at all when it comes to religion, that's the point.\n \n \n\n And who is to decide what symbols and inscriptions and names make a minimal impact and those that make a large impact?\n \n\n The courts. Someone has to care enough to complain first, of course, but then the courts decide.\n \n \n\n So if the Christians who establish Christianville accept people of other faiths into their city and don't discriminate then it would be okay to have a town of that name?\n\n And are we going to send the P.C. police there to enforce that? Better to avoid the whole issue, and not encourage anyone to think that it is a Christian only town, by not giving it such a divisive name. After all, the only good such a name does is to remind everyone of our Christian heritage, which is not something that we really are likely to forget. And it does the active harm of being divisive and exclusionary.",

   "Montalban.\n I'm sorry you're finding this complex social issue to be complex.\n\n I don't find the 'issue' complex, I find your theory complex.\n \nI realise you have trouble dealing with things that aren't black and white, and the idea that a rule might have an exception is abhorrent to you.\n\n But you don't just have an exception. You have many. And your exceptions have exceptions; such as\n No religious icons on Federal Land\n EXCEPT\n Cemeteries\n EXCEPT\n the gates.\n Why the gates? Who knows. The theory, with all these exceptions appears ad hoc; especially as many of the exceptions are left unexplained. I gave you an opportunity to list your exceptions up front; you caught me out for being sarcastic - but the question remained unanswered.\n \nHowever, that's reality. Separation of church and state is the goal.\n\n You need to put 'sometimes' at the end of that sentence, because as for an 'absolute' you make to many exceptions... And by the way, this statement of yours could be a mistake as it might allow for the expanding of the theme of this tread to all instances, not just 'the Cross' on 'federal land'. You've opened the door to discussions about\n \"In God we Trust\" on money etc.; everywhere 'Church' and State meet. However, not wishing to provoke you I will move on for now.\n \nThe fact that there are grey areas, definitional disputes, and exceptions doesn't make the goal invalid, it just means that it's people, people with differing opinions and ideas, that are trying to achieve the goal.\n\n Why doesn't it make the goal invalid? If you set a 'goal' that is by definition something you wish to achieve; but if you set a goal, and allow so many exceptions then it undermines your goal. Hence I suggested putting 'sometimes', because you're quite happy making exceptions for dead theists etc.\n \nIf you really care so much about the saltire, go start a thread about it.\n\n I just want to point out to a number of people the religious origins of the Cross of St. Andrew - hence the \"Evolution of a Flag\" post 190 of this thread was directed at no one in particular; not you, not 'no one'. I did post ones about pagans to you, but you addressed them so dismissively, and attempted to make fun of these pagans; and I pointed out parallels between them and Orthodox with regards to vestments, special religious names etc. Rather than provoking you to another anti-religious post I, as stated, directed 190 to no one in particular... but for the information of those readers who, though American, have no idea about the religion-historical nature of some symbols of American society. But it is still pertinent to this thread.\n \nIf you're so fascinated by my so called vendetta against the Cross, go start a thread.\n\n No, this is the thread that you have got a post already against a particular Cross. You specified 'the Latin Cross'. I pointed out that perhaps the Orthodox Cross is one that is okay. Is it? You use the word 'vendetta', not I, and the fact that you make exceptions to pagan religious symbols on courts makes me wonder why you're so selective against Judeo-Christian ones - but you make exceptions here too.\n \nLooking at you last half dozen posts you've said nothing about the actual issue at hand. You've just been sniping at minor issue, as if they were central to the debate.\n\n No, the issue still is regarding your apparent complaint against a particular religious icon in a particular setting. Hence you don't have a problem with non-Latin crosses such as the Orthodox Cross, or the Cross of St. Andrew.",

Rather than\n a) refute this directly\n b) give up\n you choose your usuall\n c) obfuscate.\n You dive off on a half dozen other issues without even making an attempt to show how they're related to the issue of my \"crusade against the cross\". I just wanted you to know you're not actuall fooling anyone. Now, on with the dog and pony show.\n \n \nThen why do you make exemptions and then exemptions on those?\n \n\n I have never made an exception to this. Never. Show me one post where I said, \"You can't put a cross there, but a Star of David would be fine.\" And don't paraphrase me; you're really, really bad at that. Give me an exact quote with post number please.\n \n \n\n I commend you for recognising some exceptions when they are raised; such as on cemeteries; this shows your willingness to keep a more open mind. But you've still not explained why? Other than to say 'they're dead and they're religious' - why respect the dead's religious beliefs more than the living's?\n \n\n I have answered this, several times in fact. Here's one more time. A gravestone clearly only represents the religious beliefs of the person in the grave. Freedom of religious expression demands that someone be allowed whatever trappings their religion call for on their grave. A Cross on the gates would denote the general Christian-ness of the entire graveyard, and not everyone there is Christian. That would infringe on their religious freedoms. If you still don't get this than ask decent questions. Your first question above is \"why\", with no reference. Your expansion on that is a misrepresentation of something I said. If you want good answers, learn to ask decent questions.\n \n \n\n i) the saltire is the Cross of St.Andrew - I already gave links to several posts that state this, and already suggested that you use the term because it has no obvious religious under-tones in the name itself - to anyone who didn't know what it was, whereas 'Cross of St.Andrew' contains 'cross' and 'saint' in the term. It's a slight attempt to obscure the fact, but it doesn't work\n \n\n They are not the same thing. Here's a simple proof. The Cross of St. Andrew is a religious icon, the saltire is a design on a flag. See, different things. The only \"proof\" you've given that the Alabama flag is a religious icon is the opinion of the KKK. This isn't me obscuring facts, this is you refusing to give up on a lost cause.\n \n \n \n\n ii) you stated categorically that the Latin Cross was religious - no matter where - and I raise the \"Navy Cross\" issue, which you've still not addressed - is it still religious, or is this another of your exceptions to exceptions?\n \n\n The navy cross isn't a latin cross.

   "With one problem. We have the ability to actually amend the constitution to put the supreme court out of the picture. They cannot declare an amendment unconstitutional. \n \n There rulings are not amendments. They are interpretations of what currently exists. There is a legislative and executive check for just such a thing. When the supreme court makes decisions that amount to amendments then they have stepped outside of their constitutional bounds. That is what is likely to cause people to protest and begin the amendment process. Hence the current push for a constitutional amendment to define marriage. It is in response to court opinions on the subject.\n\n \n Yes that requires 38 states and 2 thirds of both houses to approve an ammendment. But until we do that, the ruling stands. And the gay marriage ammendment doesn't have enough states to push that through and making an ammendment for crosses has a long way to go. There's a reason that in 228 years there are only 34 ammendments (I think that's the number).

   "I recognize what you're doing here.\n\n I very much doubt this statement.\n \nI've clearly shown that I don't have an issue with the Cross, that it's all in your head. Rather than\n a) refute this directly\n b) give up\n you choose your usuall\n c) obfuscate.\n You dive off on a half dozen other issues without even making an attempt to show how they're related to the issue of my \"crusade against the cross\". I just wanted you to know you're not actuall fooling anyone. Now, on with the dog and pony show.\n\n I've already shown why you're anti the Latin Cross - because you're not against the cross in other forms... such as the Cross of St. Andrew. Sorry if this makes you out to have a grudge, but when, of all the crosses around this is the only one you're attacking, then it does seem like you do have a grudge... you were the one who specified it, by using the term 'the Latin Cross'. You make the attacks against it selectively, then now state you're not against it. How very odd.\n \nThen why do you make exemptions and then exemptions on those?\n\n \n I have never made an exception to this. Never. Show me one post where I said, \"You can't put a cross there, but a Star of David would be fine.\" And don't paraphrase me; you're really, really bad at that. Give me an exact quote with post number please.\n\n Correct, you never did say that.\n You did however make a statement about 'the Cross' having Christian meaning, then changed that to a statement about 'the Latin Cross' having Christian meaning, then changed that to exclude when it's in the form of a medal, when it's inverted, or burnt.\n Then you make exemptions to religious icons that are pagan.\n [QUOTE=Montalban]I commend you for recognising some exceptions when they are raised; such as on cemeteries; this shows your willingness to keep a more open mind. But you've still not explained why? Other than to say 'they're dead and they're religious' - why respect the dead's religious beliefs more than the living's?\n \nI have answered this, several times in fact. Here's one more time. A gravestone clearly only represents the religious beliefs of the person in the grave.\n\n Why should that be paid for by the State?\n \nFreedom of religious expression demands that someone be allowed whatever trappings their religion call for on their grave.\n\n Here you go again, just saying that it 'does' doesn't answer the question.\n \nA Cross on the gates would denote the general Christian-ness of the entire graveyard, and not everyone there is Christian. That would infringe on their religious freedoms.\n\n Cool, I believe this answers the question. So, what about a deistic statement on the tomb of the unknown? What about multiple religious icons on the gate, or a generic religious term, such as a reference to \"God\"?\n \nIf you still don't get this than ask decent questions. Your first question above is \"why\", with no reference. Your expansion on that is a misrepresentation of something I said. If you want good answers, learn to ask decent questions.\n\n How come I've asked about the gate exemption dozens of times and you just answer it now?\n \n i) the saltire is the Cross of St.Andrew - I already gave links to several posts that state this, and already suggested that you use the term because it has no obvious religious under-tones in the name itself - to anyone who didn't know what it was, whereas 'Cross of St.Andrew' contains 'cross' and 'saint' in the term. It's a slight attempt to obscure the fact, but it doesn't work\n\n \n They are not the same thing. Here's a simple proof. The Cross of St. Andrew is a religious icon, the saltire is a design on a flag. See, different things. The only \"proof\" you've given that the Alabama flag is a religious icon is the opinion of the KKK. This isn't me obscuring facts, this is you refusing to give up on a lost cause.\n\n That's simply false. I gave a whole post \"Evolution of a flag\" which you responded to, so I know you've read it. So, really, by reconstructing my argument to be but one source (a straw-man argument, if you will) is obscuring the facts. I told you this back as far as post 215. You should know this, because this is one that does have 'a' reference to a racist site, but that was not the only one I gave.\n I also gave\n http://www.factmonster.com/spot/confederate1.html\n And, thus the Cross of St. Andrew on a flag is the same as if it were on a stamp, a book, a coin... it's still the Cross of St.Andrew. Oddly enough you're applying different rules here because you said that the Latin Cross is Christian, no matter what context. Obviously you have a different idea on context with relation to different crosses.\n And, you insult Floridians by suggesting that their flag represents not much more than a giant red 'X''; which, like the symbol for justice 'just represents itself'.\n Further to that, you again ignore the three crosses on the Hawaiian State Flag... that's more 'obscuring'.\n \n]ii) you stated categorically that the Latin Cross was religious - no matter where - and I raise the \"Navy Cross\" issue, which you've still not addressed - is it still religious, or is this another of your exceptions to exceptions?\n\n \nThe navy cross isn't a Latin cross. The cross pieces on a Navy Cross are the same size, the horizontal piece of a Latin Cross is shorter than the vertical. Further, the US navy history site:\n http://www.history.navy.mil/medals/navcross.htm\n indicates no religious aspect to the medal. So, to sum up:\n a)It's not a Latin Cross\n b)It's not religious\n c)You are once again deliberately obfuscating\n\n I too can admit to a mistake. I apologise for this mistake. I accept that if they are the same size, it is not the Latin Cross; then it's a Greek Cross. I suppose you're going to tell me it's a giant 'plus' sign. :)\n \niii) I asked you about the Orthodox Cross - as you seem concerned with the Latin Cross, but not the Cross of St. Andrew. Why?\n\n \nI stated, quite clearly, in my very last post, that I do have a problem with a Cross of St. Andrew on government land. Here's the exact quote:\n For that matter, if someone wanted to put up and actual Cross of St. Andrew, and not just a saltire, that would be just as bad. \n Do you read what I write at all? Part of the reason I don't expend much effort answering every single question you ask is that you don't read the answers!\n\n So somewhere in that answer is a reference to the Orthodox Cross? Also, again you obscure the facts by distinguishing between the saltire and the Cross of St. Andrew, they are the same thing.

How very odd.\n \n\n \n As he has said again and again, a cross in which there is a vertical rectangle crossed with a smaller horizontal rectangle about two thirds of the way up is a religious icon, everyone here at least knows that. I've never heard of the names such as St. Andrew, the latin one, etc. But the once found on most churches which I think is the Latin one is considered a religious icon, no matter where it is. It's the only one that a common person would see and think that whoever put it there is supporting religion, that's why it's being singled out.\n \n \n \n\n Correct, you never did say that.\n You did however make a statement about 'the Cross' having Christian meaning, then changed that to a statement about 'the Latin Cross' having Christian meaning, then changed that to exclude when it's in the form of a medal, when it's inverted, or burnt.\n Then you make exemptions to religious icons that are pagan.\n \n\n \n When I hear something about \"the cross\" I assume it's what you're calling the Latin cross. I never knew there were other ones. And as I have said AGAIN AND AGAIN no one looking at a pagan symbol feels their beliefs threatened. Do you feel the government is trying to convert you to a pagan when you look at these symbols? I feel like they want me to be a Christian when they display a cross on their property.\n \n \n\n Why should that be paid for by the State?\n \n\n Because they did a service for their country and should be rewarded for it. They are heroes and the least the state can do is pay for their gravestones.

Would you feel welcome in a cemetary where your relative was burried but on the gate it said \"in this great nation, where we don't need a god to live, just these great heroes\"?

Are you saying that there aren't people who use their religion as a front for their biggotry?\n\n The assumptions that you make about Christians in Christianville being bigoted, judgmental, and isolationist.

It's not that people are anti Christian, they're just pro everything else. They want to maintain diversity and freedom of religion. When 75% (something like that anyway) of a country follows one religion it's natural for that religion to seep into all aspects of life. That can have the effect of diminishing diversity, and so people are just trying to curtail that a bit. One vital aspect of that is keeping religion out of government, because once the government leans towards one religion then diversity and freedom go out the door.\n\n I'm not sure how a Cross on a county insignia along with pagan symbols accounts for Christianity rolling over other religions.",

   "The assumptions that you make about Christians in Christianville being bigoted, judgmental, and isolationist. Would you disallow China town because they might not allow non-Chinese in? Would you disallow Little Italy because they might all be mobsters? Would you disallow Harlem because all blacks are poor, violent, criminals? \n \n\n I think you're mixing up both your stereotypes and your prejudices here. I think it's safe to assume that most of the people in China town are chinese. Most of the people in little Italy are Italian. The bits about Italians being mobsters or blacks being criminal all came strictly from you. Also, I by no means meant to give the impression that all Christians were bigoted, judgmental, and isolationist. If I did, I apologise. What I was trying to say was that if a group of people felt it neccesary to proclaim their religion by naming their town after it, then I would suspect them of being exclusionary. \n \n \n \n\n I don't think that's what's happening in the U.S. There is an anti-Christian assault it seems.\n \n\n I disagree. I've seen alot more news stories about people being persecuted for not being Christian enough than the other way around. The \"anti-Christian\" assaults are generally in the form of law suits, while the other assaults tend to be more on the line of death threats and vandalism.\n \n \n \n\n I'm not sure how a Cross on a county insignia along with pagan symbols accounts for Christianity rolling over other religions.\n\n No idea what you're talking about here.

   "I'm hoping he'll post quotes that at least show how he got this idea, so I can explain to him why he's wrong. I find it's much easier to debate someone if I know why they think something, and frankly I'm stumped as to where this idea that I have a crusade against the cross comes from.\n\n Kronus, you misunderstand your own argument. You might be against many religious symbols being displayed, the star of David, the Hindu wheel, etc. But the one Christian symbol you're repeatedly singled out is 'the Latin Cross'. You have a selective eye for which religious symbols you'll consider are religious, and of all the crosses, it's only 'the Latin Cross'\n \n Post 99 is where you differentiated between the Cross of St. Andrew AND the Latin Cross.\n \nI think this is the crux of your misunderstanding. The desire to not have religious symbols on government property isn't an excercise in intellectual purity or philosophy. It's purely pracitical, and totally based on perception. We're not trying to remove religious symbols because we think they're icky and they should all go away, but to avoid the perception of endorsing any specific religion. The saltire (St. Andrew's cross) is, as you say, secular. The fact that its origins can be traced to the crucifiction of St. Andrew is of no import, because no one looks at the Alabama flag and thinks it has anything to do with St. Andrew. The saltire is in fact there to commemorate Scottish heritage, and that's what people think when they see the Alabama flag, if they see anything at all beyond two lines crossing. No reasonable person, to use the legal phrase, sees the Alabama flag as any sort of religious endorsement, and therefore it isn't religious endorsement, and thus is a perfectly acceptable symbol. The test isn't whether a link can be found between a symbol and any religion ever, but whether a reasonable person would look at the symbol and think that it's religious. Thus, the latin Cross, the Star of David, the Islamic moon and star, or the Buddihst wheel would all be perceived as religious symbols, whereas the saltire, the statue of Justice, the stars on the US flag, or a random tree would not be seen as religious symbols by this test.\n\n You differentiate, because 'the Latin Cross' is religious to you, the Cross of St. Andrew - using your preferred term; Saltire, is not.\n I asked\n \nAnd how is having a form of a cross advancing a religion?\n\n reply #145\n \nNot just any form of the cross. It would have to be a form considered to be a religious symbol.\n\n You are not against any form of the cross, but the Latin Cross...\n Same post\n \nIf you are refering to something other than the latin cross, then see first line in preceeding section)\n\n \n Post #148\n \nNot in this country. The Court has ruled that the latin Cross is a religious symbol, wherever it is. I've looked in FindLaw and the ACLU sites, and have yet to find anyone claiming that the saltire(St. Andrews cross on a flag) is a religious symbol.\n\n I did then point out that the Cross of St. Andrew is a religious emblem, and you whittled down my evidence to being from a KKK site (despite I've issued many different sites as evidence). You persist in the Latin Cross as being religious, the Cross of St. Andrew as not being religious.\n \n \nI am trying to convince you that these symbols are religious. At present all I see you wanting to do is to have ONE religious symbol removed.\n\n post #152\n \nHere you are simply wrong. Go back and read my posts again. I've mentioned the latin cross, menorahs, creches. If you had asked I would have also listed star of David's, the Islamic star and crescent, and the Buddihst wheel as symbols that shouldn't be on government land. This idea that I have it in for the latin Cross in particular is not true, and should not be implied from anything I've said. If this is what your trying to refute with your arguments about Justice and the Alabama flag then I suggest we drop those arguments, since they really are secondary to the main issue.\n\n So you don't have it in for the Latin Cross, because you also think the star of David etc are religious (but it seems you think only one type of cross is)\n \n post #154\n \n Move that to another country and it loses all meaning. However, move it anywhere inside America, and it still means stop, because that's what everyone in America has agreed it means. The saltire? As you say, it's secular, because that's the consensus that we've reached in this country. The latin Cross? In this country, it's symbolic of Christianity. No matter where you put it, it will be symbolic of Christianity, because that's the consensus we've reached in this country. That's the meaning for the symbols that we've agreed upon. It's possible that in Australia you've decided on a different meaning for the symbol, one which changes based on location. We have not done that here. The latin cross represents Christianity.\n\n That's why I asked you about the Orthodox Cross.\n post #171\n \nNo!\n No, no, no!\n In your country you might be able to stick the latin Cross somewhere and not have it be religious anymore, but not here! Here, the latin Cross symbolizes Christianity, period, end of story, nothing else. You quite simply can't be more wrong about this.\n \n And don't say, \"but what about flags\". I'm talking about the latin cross, not the saltire. I've tried to be very precise, and would ask you to stop using \"cross\" in an ambiguous manner.\n\n When I tried to talk about all crosses...\n \nIf you would actually keep to a statement it would be easier to follow. You did state that on a flag, you'll say it has no religious meaning,\n\n You repeat it's the Latin Cross only\n Post #186\n \n The saltire is not religious, at least on American flags. If someone wanted a town flag with a latin cross, that would be religious. Is it really so much to ask that you distinguish between these two crosses?\n\n Thus for you, the Cross of St. Andrew on a flag, is not religious. BUT the Latic Cross on a flag would be. You're against the Latin Cross. You insist that I distinguish between them!\n \n Thank you, and goodnight.:)",

   "Thus the problem still remains that when Kronus says \"I'm against religious symbols being on Federal land\" we find this statement actually means something entirely different to him than to others.\n \n We need to understand certain definitions that have risen.\n Religious symbols - examples given by Kronus; Star of David, Hindu prayer wheel, and of course, 'the Cross'. This brings us to...\n The Cross - by which Kronus means the Latin Cross only (because the Cross of St. Andrew is not, to him, religious - evidenced by the fact that he states when both appear on a flag, only one is religious). The Latin Cross is a religious symbol, always. He's stated this often.\n Federal Land - in the sentence I'm against religious symbols being on Federal land\" this is not absolute; not cemeteries, they have an exemption, because the people are dead. Why an exemption? Because they are dead. Why? Because they are!\n Always - well, when used in conjunction with 'the Latin Cross', as in the sentence 'The Latin Cross is always a religious symbol in this country', it means always EXCEPT when it's inverted or on fire, or on a bible, etc.... (I say etc. because the amount of exceptions is still as yet defined in its scope and thus potentially endless).\n Pagan symbols - are not deemed pagan because Kronus didn't know that the statue of Justice had pagan origins, then by the application by Kronus' theory that there aren't any pagans left - that the passing of time meant that they are no longer pagan (I asked him to give a year for this formula - 60 years? 100 years? etc), then he changed this to a new theory that although there are pagans in the USA, they are not genuine in their belief. And besides, the statue of justice represents justice. Why? Because it does. Why? Because! Even when he made the claim that there were no pagans, I asked him to prove it. He couldn't. Although the burden of proof was on him, I still went out of my way to show that there are pagans practicing in the USA - and some directly concerned with Greco-Roman deities. He has dropped this formula for judging if something is still religious and reverted to the 'justice statue is not religious because it isn't' statement a number of times.\n \n Kronus' argument has become so complex that he has forgotten which things he's said, demanding I show him where he differentiates, or concentrates on the Latin Cross. I have done so. He asks this because for him, the Latin Cross is synonymous with religion, and is therefore different from other religious crosses, which aren't ?!? He is genuinely of the belief that 'the Cross' and 'the Latin Cross' are synonymous, and this was because he may not have been aware of the religious origins of the Cross of St. Andrew. Any attempt he has to dismiss it's religious origins has inevitably insulted all Floridians who no doubt are proud of their heritage and would not suggest that it represents nothing more than itself, a giant red 'X'.",

He asked me to find ones that were used in a church, and I did. Then he seems now to want one that's not on a flag, but in a church, but one that's 3-D. Why? You don't seem to understand Kronus making exceptions to rules. He said of the Latin Cross that it was religious REGARDLESS of what form it took. One would have to ask, why then in St. Andrew's Cross - used in and by church - not also so religious? Clearly it has religious meaning, no matter how many times he wants to call it the Saltire.\n Yet, his whole 'search' is conducted by me, and in my goodness I do it, even though the onus is on him, as it's his convoluted theory, not mine. I would still like him to explain why pagans worshipping pagan gods doesn't mean that the Statue of Justice is not pagan. He makes 'just-so' statements that it 'just is' a representation of justice.",

You start at the wrong place.\n Earlier, post 232\n \nCan you do me a favor concerning St. Andrew's crosses? Would you post a link to a picture of one that's not on a flag, but is in a church? I'd appreciate it.\n\n This is what I said in my last post. He only asked for things 'not on a flag'. That was his only condition.\n The very next post, I gave several that fit the test he gave. (and more at post 235).\n Then he comes back with the post that you re-print above. He now is talking about them not just existing outside of flags, but in 3-D form or whatever. He's moved the goal-posts. He's gone from some attempt to argue* that they're not religious because they're not in church - and he wants me to show that they are in church - except on a flag, and I did that. So, he's got to now go for, not on a flag, or an icon, or a shield etc, he's moving the definition AND all the time it is irrelevant because\n a) I've shown sites that show the Satire (his preferred term) is synonymous with the Cross of St.Andrew (post #238) and therefore has religious symbology as it's used in churches and by churches\n and\n b) his own argument about the Latin Cross is that it is religious no matter what form it takes. So why not the Cross of St. Andrew, or is this another exception to a rule?\n \n So he says that I've been unable to find St. Andrew's crosses that aren't physical, when he didn't ask me to find them that are physical. That's why I said it was strange that he should find it odd that I didn't find any, because I didn't look for any. BUT it's, as I said, a nonsense shift anyway because of points a) and b) above. He's grasping at straws here and his argument is the most ad hoc I've seen on these debates\n \n AND\n He's still unable to explain why the pagan statues of justice aren't pagan (other than his argument that they 'just represent justice'; why? 'because')\n He changed so quickly on this too.\n i) he didn't know the statue of justice was pagan\n ii) it's not pagan if people don't worship it for a number of years\n a) how many years? I don't know, he never answered that\n So I pointed out there are still pagans\n He couldn't find any, so I did the search to show him\n He then argued that they won't really pagan, but some mock-up\n I posted more stuff. And wham-bam, he reverts to a 'she represents justice because she does'.\n She doesn't 'just represent justice'. People chose her because she's the pagan goddess of justice, and as there are still pagans in the USA worshipping her, then it's a religious symbol. But he's not against that, only the Latin Cross - which he differentiates from other crosses; hence this long-winded argument over the Cross of St.Andrew.\n \n And worse for you, Zachva, you've tied yourself to his nonsensical argument.\n \n \n * though he couches this in terms of understanding; as he's trying to understand me, as if!",

   "St. Andrews Cross appears in medals, decorations and so on, used by religious people\n \n 14K ST. ANDREW MEDAL\n http://www.faithjewelry.com/cgi-bin/order.pl\n \"A representation of St. Andrews Cross adorns the Chalice used as the symbol and logo of the Christian Church Disciples of Christ. St. Andrews Cross resembles the letter \"X\" in the English alphabet and is also referred to as the \"saltier\" or \"Crux Decussata.\" According to tradition Andrew, the brother of Peter, was crucified on a cross of this shape. Andrew did not feel worthy enough to die on the same style of cross as Christ so requested a cross of another shape. \n His request was granted and he was crucified upside down on a cross which is now designated with his name. Andrew was bound to the cross with ropes, rather than nails, which was to have prolonged his suffering. \n St. Andrew's Cross came into wide use during the Medieval Period and became the national cross of Scotland.\"\n http://www.pvcconline.org/cross/crosshistory.htm\n \n and non-religious\n http://www.otagogolfclub.co.nz/history3.htm\n and\n http://www.wiolawapress.com/andrews.htm\n and\n http://www.alguard.state.al.us/awards.htm\n who still commemorate St. Andrew all.\n \n Why? Because it is a cross that is a religious symbol...\n Cross - Christian Symbols\n \n Types of Cross' \n Botonee Cross - it is a + sign but has a tiny cross piece on each end of the arms represents the trinity .\n Calvary Cross- a Cross standing on three steps or blocks. stands for Faith, Hope and Love( or Charity) often the words are on the blocks\n Eastern Cross - (Russian/Greek Orthodox) looks like a regular cross but has two extra cross beams one short one at the top to represent the sign that was placed over Christ's Head, The other for the shoulders and hands (the standard crossbeam) and one short one that usually is slanted somewhat for the feet to be nailed to.\n Gothic Cross - has flowery ends to the arms of the cross. Sometime tightly budded and sometimes full open. The elderly had the fully opened.\n Greek Cross - Looks like an + with even arms\n Ionic or Celtic Crosses look the same the ends flair outward, like the shape of a trumpet and it has the circle in it.\n Latin cross - is the regular familiar one\n Saint Andrews Cross - looks like an X it is the symbol on the Confederate Battle Flag\n http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~txcemeteries/symbol.htm\n They are equally religious. Kronus' reply will be to say \"What is it you're trying to say? I'm just trying to understand you, that's all\" OR \"You don't want to debate, I've tried, but I'm leaving\"\n \n But for anyone genuinely interested in Kronus' sinuous exercise where he both attempts to differentiate between these two crosses, and also says he's not picking on the Latin Cross, hopefully he will at least attempt to formulate a debate.\n \n Other sites that show different types of crosses...\n http://home.inreach.com/bstanley/crosses.htm\n and\n Berry (Encyclopaedia Heraldica) mentions 385 different crosses. Most are purely decorative or of heraldic significance (ERE, art. Cross, Vol. 4, pp. 324 ff). There are 9 types of crosses which have religious symbolism. These are:\n The Greek or equilateral cross;\n the so-called Latin cross (crux immissa or capitata) with the lower limb longer than the three others;\n the Tau shaped cross (potenc\u00e9e or commissa);\n the handled cross (crux ansata);\n the St Andrews cross (crux decussata);\n the Gammate cross;\n the Maltese or rayed cross;\n the Lorraine cross with double or triple traverse;\n the cross mounted on steps (perronn\u00e9e).\n http://www.ccg.org/english/s/p039.html",

You didn't; for the Latin Cross you said regardless of its context, its religious. I merely have endeavoured to point out that, by your own rule, if that were true, then the Cross of St. Andrew, regardless of its context is religious. And you denied it even was to begin with, by using the word 'saltire' in a very silly attempt to make it sound like a non-religious symbol; just a giant 'X'.

But the point is, he argues that he does not differentate, or pick on one, but he does do exactly that.\n \n Further I argued that you need to look at a cross in context, whether it be on a flag or not. I was the one who said if its on a flag it's secular. He argued that the Latin Cross no matter what the context was religious. I then said if this were so, then all the other crosses were religious too. He wanted to know what other crosses; I pointed out the Hawaiian flag, and concentrated more on the Cross of St. Andrew because it appears on more flags.

No matter how much information I present about the meaning of 'saltire', or the religious background of various crosses, he says its different, and thus he does indeed differentiate between crosses, whilst at the same time swearing he doesn't.\n \n I argued for reasons of semiotics. He seems now to be trying to introduce a context argument where he rules that the Cross of St. Andrew, on the Scots flag is religious (in fact it's not, its secular; the Scots flag represents Scotland). It is a cross where-by it has religious roots, but in a new context takes new meaning. I may have lost sight of this argument due to his frustrating tactice re: finding pictures in a church but not on a flag.",

   "I was talking about the Florida flag, because it has several links to St. Andrew; through the Burgundian Cross, and the Confederate Flag etc. I've no idea why you'd want to swap flags, especially as all my research was on the Florida flag, unless that's the reason, so you can call for research on this flag too! Regardless, let's move to what 'evidence' you've found...\n \nSure, please provide quotes, rather than a 'just-so' statement.\n\n \nHere's an idea. Rather than me throwing up a dozen posts and letting you sift through them, how about you ask something specific, like \"I don't agree with that, can you back it up\"\n\n You're the one who made a 'just-so' statement that my posts back up your claims; show me. You have got away with the evidence-lite approach for quite some time; I've been quite happy in the past to show you where you were mistaken re: pagans in America, and St.Andrew's crosses used by churches, that are not on flags. I've in fact been quite accommodating. I know this is a novel idea; backing up a statement with references. Try it on for size.\n \nSO now you arbitrarily go through sets of flags and say the same cross, in different circumstances is religious, or not.\n\n \nThere was nothing arbitrary about it at all. If you put a symbol on you flag to honor a saint, it's religious. If you put a symbol on a flag to honor a country, it's secular. That's really straight forward.\n\n The flag of Scotland is secular. It represents Scotland. It is made in honour of St. Andrew, but it represents Scotland. The cross represents St. Andrew, but the flag represents Scotland. A Latin Cross on a flag could hark back to Christ, but in the context of a flag, such as if it did exist on a national/state/regional flag, it would be representative of that nation/state/region. There are many crosses on flags, from Denmark, Switzerland etc. Thus the British flag which has three crosses on it, is representative of Britain. The placing of a cross, or two, or three on a secular context makes it secular. Thus in a secular context the cross is secular. It's why people who aren't religious wear it, as a part of fashion, and they don't feel religious at all. However (excepting now for two exceptions) you believe on cross in particular transcends context and is religious, even when on a flag. It if is, then so should all other forms of cross, but they you claim you don't differentiate, even though you do.\n \nYET the Latin Cross is religious regardless of the CONTEXT, but then you claim you're not picking on it. You are. If one is religious regardless of the context, then why isn't the other?\n\n \nRight back at you. How can you insist that moving a cross down the block can suddenly make it secular, but if you put it on a different flag in a different country with a different motivation it stays religious?\n\n I've already explained this. You put it in a courthouse, and people know that a courthouse is about 'court', not 'church'.\n \nFor that matter, I've already said that if you set a cross on fire it becomes a symbol of terror and not religion, so I am in fact not claiming that in every possible context the Latin cross is religious. I adjusted that position a while back, I guess you didn't notice, being so set on proving my vendetta as you were.\n\n I did notice. You also made one other concession, if it's turned upside down. But you did say that even on a flag, it's religious. Which is silly, if it were part of a national flag, it would represent the nation.\n \nTo refresh your memory, it was I who argued that context was all important, thus a cross, regardless of what form, was secular if on a flag. I merely have endeavoured to point out that, by your own rule, if that were true, then the Cross of St. Andrew, regardless of its context is religious.\n\n \nYou argued that, and you were wrong.\n\n Another of you just-so's. You went to a 'you don't understand us' debate which is impossible to prove, it was a marvellous rhetorical ploy though, but had little real value. Any argument made by me, and you could claim that it was simply because I didn't understand America; that your ideas were representative of what Americans understood. Perhaps you've even convinced yourself?\n \n Context is important, but not all important. A symbol means what people say it means. That's the all important criteria. If they say it changes meaning in a different context, than it does.\n\n I think here you mistake between what you believe, and what is.\n \n If they don't say that, then it doesn't. But thank you for finally getting around to why you've been bothering with this line of debate. I do appreciate that. However, it would have been better if, rather than vociferously claiming that various flags were religious, you emphasized that what you were saying was that according to what you perceived as my rules, the flags should be considered religious. For that matter, what is your position? Are the various state flags religious or not? What do you think?\n\n In the context of where they are, these crosses are not religious, and likewise in the context of where it is, a Latin Cross is not religious. You believe it is, that people will mistake a court for a church. You differentiate it from the other crosses around the courthouse, even though you claim you don't.\n \n So, to summarize:\n I recognize the importance of context, as shown by my insistence that the Alabama flag isn't religious. I've mentioned an instance where the Latin cross can be considered non-religious, i.e. when it's been set on fire in an act of terror. I still maintain that the mere act of putting a cross in a government setting is insufficient to have it become a secular symbol.\n\n Then your last line just argues against yourself, because merely putting a cross on a flag doesn't make it cease to be religious.\n We're back to you arguing this 'super-Cross' belief that the Latin Cross is so powerful a symbol that it transcends all context (excpting two exceptions only recently go to), and that it, above all other crosses can do this; thus it is different from other crosses; you differentiate, even though you claim you don't.",

Yes? Is that correct?\n\n I believe that religious-based symbols influenced by context can take on new meaning. Symbols can mean a myriad of things for different people. You, who have a particular educational background, knowledge of symbols, particular political bent or whatever (and I'm not judging this as good or bad) comes up with an idea based on what you think a particular symbol represents. Another person might believe the Cross represents something else.\n \n If you have a cross, any type of cross, but just for laughs, let's concentrate on your fave, the Latin Cross, it is automatically assumed to be Christian by some, such as yourself (I acknowledge your one or two exceptions). If I saw some rock star wearing it; such as some secularists do, I would not assume he/she was religious, but simply wearing a number of symbols that have some kind of 'pop' meaning. I see non-religious people wear several symbols all at once. I don't believe this indicates some pantheism of theirs; or an indecision.\n \n Thus at\n http://www.voodooyou.com/accessories/\n you can buy crosses that aren't necessarily representative of all that is Christian, in fact the site name suggests 'voodoo' and they frequently use Christian-based symbols in their very non-Christian ritual.\n Thus also\n \"For example, a pentagram to a pagan is mostly likely a symbol of the goddess, whereas to a Christian it may be a \"satanic\" symbol (regardless of orientation). The inverted cross, is also touted as a \"satanic\" symbol, yet it's origin's have to do with St. Peter\"\n http://www.hunter.apana.org/~gallae/hecate/reference/symbols/symbols_satanist.htm (I get stuff from lots of odd sites, don't I; but this fact of perception is true).\n \n I will concede that a number of people may perceive a cross in (almost) any circumstance as representative of them and their Christian values. And you may be aware of only these people, who may crow triumphantly about Christianity being the dominant religion etc. However, . I also see that people will read into it, what they will; as a symbol of Christian hegemony over America, or a symbol of a Christian past - as a mark of respect.\n \n In this day and age I do not believe that you can ascribe a single meaning to it and say \"It is always Christian\" (even accepting your two exceptions). And, at the same time, say that another cross is universally non-Christian (even accepting your one or two exceptions). This is the thing with living in a post-modern world. So many people take symbols and make them their own symbols. People appropriate symbols.\n \n If you want to establish a practical test to apply, then you could perhaps poll all Americans and ask them what they think it represents, and if a majority said \"This symbol represents Christianity as it is now; (and therefore is pushing a particular religion) I would bow out of this debate. Alternatively, and perhaps this is both easier and more accurate, you could appeal to history and ask \"Why is the cross in court?\"\n \n a) If it is there to represent a Christian past, a reminder of Judeo-Christian legal influence, then you have your answer to what it symbolises.\n \n b) If it is there to push Christianity by the state, then again you have your answer. And I would bow out of this debate.\n \n I believe it is there for the Judeo-Christian legal influence just stated above. And I would also say that this is so for the pagan symbology too; that it is reflective of the past, and not pushing neo-paganism. However, you seem to believe on symbol is pushing a particular religious idea, and so I still can't work out why this symbol is able to do this, and none of the others. It makes no sense to me that you would single out one particular symbol and accord to it a status that you don't all the others that have religious backgrounds. It is sort of a super-symbol that is (almost) always Christian.\n \n Further I find b) scenario extremely unlikely given the near-paranoia Americans have with regards separating Church and State; that even the slightest hint of religiousness and there's an uproar. If you have an alternative scenario, then this too would likely argue against position.\n \n \nPoints I'm still unsure on:\n i) Does this apply to every religious symbol?\n ii) Does it lose all religious meaning?\n If you could just let me know if I have your position correct or not it would really help keep the debate on track. Thanks\n\n Every religious symbol? I don't know about that. There might be a symbol unique to a Amazonian culture that no one else has ever appropriated; and it might thus be totally symbolic of one thing.",

   "Welcome back. Your absence was briefer than I anticipated.\n \n \nI'd like to touch on this. Particularly where you say \"I will concede that a number of people may perceive a cross in (almost) any circumstance as representative of them and their Christian values.\" What I've been trying to say is not that the cross represents any particular set of value, but that it represents Christianity.\n\n You need to modify this statement or it seems you've reversed position again regards an inverted cross, or a cross on fire; both of which aren't particularly Christian.\n \nCertainly what \"Christianity\" means to people can vary wildly. You've read the various posts here, you don't need me to tell you this. When I've been saying that it's a Christian symbol, I don't mean it in any specific sense.

That's what I mean when I've been saying it's a Christian symbol, and that people are going to consider it to be Christian in most any context\n\n I don't doubt that it means 'Christianity' to you and many, but in what context, (I have to ask this again)? You seem to think that it's Christianity, in a present tense, rather than a recognition of a past debt. I believe, in the context of a court-house, it's a past debt statement, which combined with secular symbols of justice, and power, and the past debt symbols of pagan origin it goes to build a picture somewhat like saying \"We are America. This is our justice system dispensed here. Based on the principles handed down to us from Judeo-Christian and Greco-Roman tradition.\"\n I find it difficult to understand it in a context along the lines of saying \"This is a Christian nation! We are proudly Christian to the exclusion of other faiths!\" (or words to the effect of pushing a particular religion; which is why your courts have allowed the context of some Judeo-Christian symbology in courts, this being one of them; because it's not pushing/establishing a particular faith). And as such, as it is a symbol; albeit a religious-based one, because it is there with a number of other symbols, including ones based on other religions, it is not pushing for a particular faith, in fact, I believe it's not pushing for any religion at all.\n \nPeople may appropriate it to represent some specific aspect of Christianity, but whatever symbolism they use, the core meaning will still incorporate Christianity.\n\n That is superfluous to the argument at hand. For, if you make this argument than anything can be Christian, just by the use of Christian symbology; you're moving back to your super-symbol idea, and this will lead me back to asking about the various cross of the state flags of Florida etc. And we both don't want to go down that path, I would hope. I too get tired of repeating myself, though you probably wouldn't think it.",
