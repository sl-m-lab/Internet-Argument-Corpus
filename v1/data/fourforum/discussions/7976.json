Man, I see this/hear it all the time in various subtle forms- that if a woman was raped, somehow it's her fault.\n\n \n Did you not see the rest of my sentence? I never said rape was the woman's fault (unless she was the one raping someone else). I know it isn't.

I said. \"It may be her fault that she placed herself in that situation\" (Whoops... I editted my typo of Maybe to May be). \n \n Example of a girl putting herself in a bad situation: A young female going to a college party by herself, where there are bunches of (most likely bigger) guys, drugs, alcohol...etc. \n \n This is a bad situation to put yourself in, is it not? I'm 5 nothing, personally if I was going to go by myself to this place... I'm putting myself at a greater risk than if I had a group of people going with me. It would be my fault cause I know that it's not a good idea; cause I knew that it could be a dangerous situation. BUT,  It's not my fault if I were raped . No matter where a person is, no one has the right to rape them. So that's what I mean when I say fault of putting one self in that situation. I'm not saying that she's at fault for the rape. There's a difference. \n \n However, sometimes it's impossible to not put yourself in a high risk situation: walking to your car alone... or anything \"alone\"... etc... but in those cases you have no choice at times (unlike going to a party alone).\n \n Example of a female not putting herself in a bad situation: Too many to even try to list... but I think you guys get the point when I say situation.

Only a human being can grow into a human being. Being young hardly excludes its right to live.\n \n \n \nAnd thanks for making me look like I'm a baby killer. You twisted what I said around to make it sound like I'm the Hitler for babies. I never said lets go kill all children who are suffering in this world. I said I rather not have that fetus suffer. \n\n \n So you're going to kill it instead of giving it a chance to live even? Dying is a worse thing than suffering later in life. At least the baby will have been given the chance to live.\n \n \nAnd yes a women should take responsiblity, but the man does too. In the case of RAPE, she isn't at fault for the rape, therefore she is not responsible for getting pregnant. That sex was forced on her. This is another problem, i think half of us are talking about wanted sex by both persons, while the other half is referring to rape. \n\n \n Rape and Incest make up only 1% of the abortions in the United States. The would make about 13-15 thousand mothers aborting them. (And not all of them have abortions voluntarily by the way)\n \n Currently, the number of abortions going on in the United states is around 1.3-5 million a year. Wouldn't it be better to make just that 1% live with their babies till they're born and save 1.3-5 million baby's lives?\n \n When someone mentions rape, I do feel sympathy for the victims. In my mind there is nothing worse that can happen to a person except for murder. So I do feel for these women, however I also feel for the babies. The women who is raped and conceives is not going to die for living with her baby till it is born. But the baby will be killed; and currently over a million of them are being killed. I would rather illegalize abortion completely and force them to live with it while saving over a million babies.",

   "Sorry, I thought I said that. Just for the record: \"Resonsibility is required of both the man and the women.\"\n\n \n Nope you said;\n \n The Mother is usually the one responsible for conceiving the baby. The man should be responsible too, but she's the one who will get pregnant and she has to consent to sex. I don't think a woman should have the right to do what she likes with her body and kill her baby whenever she gets pregnant. I think the responsibility rests with the Mother first in this case, and the baby should not die for her.\n \n If a woman does not wish that to happen, she should tell the man. The man should be responsibile for the baby, but things like you mention are regular things in sex. A man should be resonsible too, that I agree with. But don't try and lay the entire blame on the men.\n \n You mumble about how the man should be responsible, yet have very strict and definitive expectations for the mother. You hold a glaringly obvious double standard in regards to responsibility in sex, pregnancy and parenting.\n \n \n \nI don't think I took what you said out of context.\n \n Are you referring to the 1% of women who have abortions for that reason?\n\n \n Yes you did and yes I was speaking specifically about rape. \n \n Ice Proncess said this:\n \n Just because the baby is a product of rape does not mean it is a \"evil\" baby. Give it up for adoption. And when I said one life would have to end that would be the choice of the mother....there are exceptions to every law. Even though it is legal to kill a fetus doesnt make it right.\n \n I responded:\n \n Ever been pregnant? It is not as simple as being pregnant and BOOP out comes a baby to give away. Pregnancy wreaks havoc on a woman;s body, emotions and mind. Women are not big empty reseptacles with nothing going on except waiting to get pregnant. They have lives - committments, responsibilities - all of which WILL BE impacted by that pregnancy. You have no business expecting she and her family put all that on the line for pregnancy she did not consent to. I would never keep a baby from rape. I have a job, things I am doing, and an already born kid to support. None of them are up for grabs becuase you wuv awl wa wittle babies.\n \n \n \nNo, it is your own responsibility to avoid risking pregnancy till you want a baby. You shouldn't be given a license to kill the baby when you're the one who had sex. (I know, the man must be held responsible too)\n\n \n There you go kinda sorta making the man responsible too.\n \n Anyway, I agree that people should be a little more pro-active in preventing unwanted pregnancy. I believe in open and honest dialogue with kids about sex and an all its consequences. I think birth control should be really easy to get a hold of - and free. I think we need to stop stigmatizing sexual activity and attempt to get a healthy attitude about it in this country. We have got to stop teaching girls that men should be the center of their universe (got a boyfirend? when you gonna get married? bla bla bla) - for that will lead to sex. We need to EMPOWER women - which means letting them make their own choices - even when they are bad ones. For every woman will draw her line in the sand - and laws won't matter. I won't keep a pregnancy from rape or that would threaten my health or my livlihood. Period. Regardless of law. (However - I am safe and my tubes are tied.) \n \n Point - laws will do nothing but make lifers feel better.",

But protected sex is hardly 100% gauranteed to prevent conceiving. The risk is always there. In your mind, does getting pregnant from having sex justify an abortion if you were using protection?\n \n \nThe period that I believe a fetus becomes a \"baby\" in the stomach, even though he is considered a fetus till birth, that's when he becomes a neonate by law. When the fetus can survive outside of the womb then it is considered a baby. \n\n \n Okay, but let me ask you this. What if a baby is born prematurely? Like a month or so early? Does this give the couple the right to kill it since it isn't 9 months old? I know your 3 month thing, but by law, wouldn't that be legitimate? A baby is a baby all the way through from beginning to end.\n \n \nI just see some cases where you just shouldn't keep the fetus.

Hooking, beating, and other forums of illegal abortions make me feel bad for both the women and fetus, but that woman risking her life is trying to do it because it might just 'save' her life. Of course others see otherwise. \n\n \n SOME cases, maybe. I need to see some first though.\n \n Abortion would be more dangerous to the woman's health than to have a baby. It still is healthier for the women to keep the fetus till term than to have the baby killed inside her. It can harm her psychologically and phsyically. It can harm her fertility too. (Look at some of their methods... Brrr!) Abortion is still dangerous to the woman legal or not. Having a baby might cause physical problems, but not in the way an abortion might.\n \n Any crime is dangerous for the commiter of the crime in some way. That doesn't mean we should legalize it so less people will be hurt by it.\n \n -----\n \n Oh, by the way, have you ever read Dr. Bernard Nathanson's book about abortion? He's the no. 1 guy in this field and he is now (or was, don't know if he died or not yet) pro-life. He has a very well developed view on abortion and what a fetus truly is even while it's inside the mother.

Is he raising her kids?

The roughly 100 billion neurons in the brain constitute the material basis of thought. The neurons are connected to each other, and their linkups play a major role in what we experience as thinking. But large-scale linking up of neurons doesn't begin until the 24th to 27th week of pregnancy--the sixth month. \n \n By placing harmless electrodes on a subject's head, scientists can measure the electrical activity produced by the network of neurons inside the skull. Different kinds of mental activity show different kinds of brain waves. But brain waves with regular patterns typical of adult human brains do not appear in the fetus until about the 30th week of pregnancy--near the beginning of the third trimester. Fetuses younger than this--however alive and active they may be--lack the necessary brain architecture. They cannot yet think.2) (from Tastyfish's post): From http://7e.devbio.com/article.php?ch=21&id=162If life and death are based upon the same standard of measurement, then the beginning of human life should be recognized as the time when a fetus acquires a recognizable EEG pattern. This acquisition occurs approximately 24- 27 weeks after the conception of the fetus and is the basis for the neurological view of the beginning of human life. \n ...\n Despite lacking a precise explanation for the connection between the EEG and neural activity, there is a strong argument that the unique and highly recognizable EEG pattern produced by a mature brain is a defining characteristic of humanity (Morowitz and Trefil 1992). Therefore, the moment that a developing fetus first exhibits an EEG pattern consistent with that of a mature brain is indicative of the beginning of human life. It is from this point and onward during development that the fetus is capable of the type of mental activity associated with humanity (Morowitz and Trefil 1992). \n I could try to find more links, but these two should do for now. \n \n I have presented evidence for my claim. Now you should present some evidence on your side. The burden of evidence lies on anyone making a claim - which includes you since you make a claim that the mind can exist before the third trimester.",

   "...is a fetus a COMPLETE body yet?\n \n\n YES! ~ All body systems are present by 8 weeks (2 months). Hooker & Davenport, The Prenatal Origin of Behavior, University of Kansas Press, 1952\n and\n the baby's stomach secretes gastric juice by then also. Now we can listen to the tiny one's heartbeat on an ultrasonic stethoscope. These are now common in doctors' offices and on hospital wards. (They are never used in abortion facilities, however, as this information is universally withheld from mothers prior to abortion. Abortionists know that if they tell women there already is a heartbeat - and certainly if they would let her listen to the heartbeat - most mothers would change their minds). The actual sounds of an six-week-old baby's heartbeat are available on tape from Cincinnati Right to Life, ($3.00).\n and\n P.E. Rockwell, M.D., Director of Anesthesiology, Leonard Hospital, Troy, New York, U.S. Supreme Court., Markle vs. Abele, 72-56, 72-730, p. 11, 1972 - added: \"\"11 years ago, while giving an anesthetic for a ruptured tubal pregnancy (at two months), I was handed what I believed to be the smallest human being ever seen. The embryo sac was intact and transparent. Within the sac was a tiny (1/3 inch) human male swimming extremely vigorously in the amniotic fluid, while attached to the wall by the umbilical cord. This tiny human was perfectly developed.., with long, tapering fingers, feet and toes. It was almost transparent as regards the skin, and the delicate arteries and veins were prominent to the ends of the fingers.\n \n \"The baby was extremely alive and swam about the sac approximately one time per second with a natural swimmers stroke. This tiny human did not look at all like the photos and drawings of 'embryos' which I have seen, nor did it look like the few embryos I have been able to observe since then, obviously because this one was alive. \"When the sac was opened, the tiny human immediately lost its life and took on the appearance of what is accepted as the appearance of an embryo at this stage (blunt extremities, etc.).\"\n and\n At 9-10 weeks, he squints, swallows, moves his tongue, and if you stroke his palm, will make a tight fist, \"bending his fingers round an object in the palm of his hand.\" Valman & Pearson, \"What the Fetus Feels,\" British Med.

   "Two sources come to mind:\n \n 1) From from part 4 of http://www.2think.org/abortion.shtml\n But brain waves with regular patterns typical of adult human brains do not appear in the fetus until about the 30th week of pregnancy--near the beginning of the third trimester. Fetuses younger than this--however alive and active they may be--lack the necessary brain architecture. They cannot yet think.[/INDENT]\n 2) (from Tastyfish's post): From http://7e.devbio.com/article.php?ch=21&id=162If life and death are based upon the same standard of measurement, then the beginning of human life should be recognized as the time when a fetus acquires a recognizable EEG pattern. This acquisition occurs approximately 24- 27 weeks after the conception of the fetus and is the basis for the neurological view of the beginning of human life. \n ...\n Despite lacking a precise explanation for the connection between the EEG & neural activity, there is a strong argument that the moment that a developing fetus first exhibits an EEG pattern consistent with that of a mature brain is indicative of the beginning of human life .(Morowitz and Trefil 1992). I could try to find more links, but these two should do for now. \n\n Sorry, that Brain/EEG-argument falls apart, because it can not make the requisite connections:\n \n Fact: As of today, no scientifically-accurate tools exist, for determining entire worlds of being. \n \n Even using 37-electrodes on a person's scalp, all they are capable of measuring is  tiny bits of voltage coming from the surface of the skin of the cortex (the top outer  layer of the brain). \n \n Now, considering that the estimated 100 billion neurons in the brain are *inter-connected* with each cell... in the rest... of the body, and each of these cells can \"synapse\" with a 1000 other cells simultaneously, your 37 simpleton-EEG measurements are evidently inadequate for \"measuring\" Life, let alone each \"thought\". Relatedly, this is also why EEG's can't be relied upon for *accurately knowing* when a person has left her or his body, or not. - even as sometimes that guessing is used prior to killing people, to \"transplant\" their organs.)\n \n Sorry, an EEG fails as a valid indicator of the *richness... of Life whether in a fetus, or a comatose adult*.\n \n Annie",

Just pointing out that it's somewhat hypocritcal. Just like a pro-lifer advocating FOR the death penalty is. You lot often seem more focused on a bunch of fertilized cells instead of the human beings that are ALREADY here and dying. Guess it's simpler, y'know?

   "Even a person without a mental existence can feel. A person who's been hit on the head and deemed a vegetable is still a person. If you're wife had been a victim of such an occurence, would you have no real objection to alowing her death? You should have sympathy for someone who doesn't have a mental existence regardless of age simply for the fact that you would want someone else to do it for you. That is your approach to morality after all. \n\n You seem to misunderstand what I mean by a \"mental existence\". Perhaps you are assuming that I mean a conscious mental existence. That is not the case. We can still mentally exist even when we are not conscious - as in sleep or in a coma. Our mental existence is then only subconscious. I only require some initial level of mental existence - a mind (conscious or subconscious) not just a body. A person without a mental existence, as I define it, cannot possibly feel. They may have involuntary reflex actions against heat, proding objects, etc, but, in an early fetus, those are not the mind's reactions, just the bodies. (Ex. touch a decapitated frog in certain spots and it will also move - that is an example of a simple reflex action).\n \n \"I\" will stop existing once my mind stops existing and I view that as being true for all others. Therefore, as soon as my mind stops existing within the body, I would have people treat my body as if I am gone - unplug it, etc. I would have no objections since \"I\" would no longer be intricately connected to the body - I would either cease to exist (scientific point of view) or exist mentally in another separate phase (religious point of view). SImilarly, \"I\" did not start to exist until my mind started to - around the beginning of the third trimester. So, whatever happened before that would not have affected \"me\", it would have just affected the chance of my coming into existence (as would my parents use of contraception, their having even met, etc.).\n \nSo what if they don't suffer? It still is just as wrong. I could cut the arm off a victim in a coma and call myself clean of any crime since I caused no pain or suffering. I could shoot someone through the head and kill them in a second, and there would be no suffering. You must admit that though suffering doesn't exist, it still is equally wrong.\n\n There are many reasons why I don't believe people with minds should not be hurt, if avoidable. One of those reasons is suffering. There are other reasons. For example, the assumption that someone with a mind would not want to cease to exist without their permission (as I would not want to be killed if I were asleep). My general approach has been to shape my morality to try to treat others as I would myself be treated. Bottom line - my view is that people (myself included) don't exist until their minds start to exist. It is people that I value, not bodies.",

Considering the irregular cases of such things (such as recovering from a deep coma or loss of mind intelect or comprehension) Anybody in a coma or supposedly brain-dead condition should be treated as currently living since the possibilities are there for him/her to recover. \n\n I can understand that, given your belief system, you might think that the soul leaves the body only once it is completely dead. However, I do not share your belief system. I try to base my views on scientific evidence and, though such scientific evidence is not yet complete, those who are most knowledgable in the subject - i.e. neurologists - associate higher level EEG patterns with the existence of either conscious or subconscious thoughts (i.e. mind). Those in a coma do have EEG patterns so there is potentially some subconcious level of mind still operating. For me, I trust the knowledge of neurologists in thinking that, as long as there are EEG patterns indicative of a still sufficiently working higher brain, there is a possibility of a continuing mind. Once there are no longer any EEG patterns and the higher level brain no longer functions, then the mind no longer exists within the body. \n \nNobody should play God and decide to pull the plug because THEY decide there is no wrong being done with the person knowing about it. That's like saying \"What they don't know can't hurt them.\"\n\n Before a person exists, there is no one to whom we owe anything. Before I came into existence (namely, when my mind came into existence), then it would not have made much of a difference if I had been aborted at, say, the fourth month or if I had never been conceived. Either way, there would have been no \"I\" yet to destroy and both situations would have equally led to my lack of existence. \n \n But, don't you care that the chances for existence are taken away from over a million babies every year? Regardless of whether they know it or not, doesn't that sound like a superextreme case of injustice to you?\n\n The chances of existence are taken away from billions of potential babies every year when unfertilized eggs are not fertilized. I do not mourn those. For those abortions that are performed in the first or second trimester, it is not the beings that existed that I would feel sad for, since they were still only bodies, but I would feel sad for the people those fetii could have become. I do have some respect for the POTENTIAL that those fetii represented, but I do not place the importance of such POTENTIAL people above the rights of the mother.

   "You are *so* off your rocker. \n \n\n Thank you! for your compliment :) \n \n\n We don't know how to enjoy the process of impregnation, pregnancy and birth? \n I...really can't see how that's enjoyable - unless you WANT a baby, at which point abortion isn't an issue.\n \n\n Right - and how many mothers *selflessly CARE*? ... asking how many (of 40 million babies) WANT to live? - two even better questions, you might agree.\n \n\n And it's around 40 million, Annie, over 34 years. Averages about 1.3 million abortions per year (including those done for health-related causes). And I still don't consider those aborted fetuses \"babies.\" \n \n\n So, how is that different from being \"in-step\" with those US-girls/women, Lethally \n much worse than any Nazi executioner - and for 34 long years. \n \n And you think such a Resume is a record to live *justly proud* of? -\n \n and how shall you answer God, on the day of your Accounting of your life?\n \n\n And, generally speaking Annie, we pro-choice folk don't go hunting down teenagers, online in order to get them to have an abortion. \n \n\n Then prove otherwise.\n \n By starting to Debate LIFE, for once. Actually much better said, the *quality* thereof, for ALL.\n \n\n Out of curiosity, do you give much time and money to pro-life organizations? \n \n\n All our activities are, safely, *pro-life* - and positive, constructive, generative, encouraging, etc. This is what we choose spending our time/money on... - and joyfully so :) \n \n\n Aren't there little starving babies in Africa and Asia who could do with a bit of a hand up? \n \n\n Planet earth was *designed/created* to handle lots more individuals, than the few billions inhabiting it now.\n \n (not for lack of natural-resources), \n Africa's & Asia's (in particular) babies go starving because of their \"Evil, selfish\" political Rulers.\n \n\n You advocate bringing unwanted children into the world when we already have plenty. Nice. \n \n\n Wrong. \n I advocate *Allowing all God's spirit-children* the SAME-chance (that evidently you were given), and \n Yes - this is nice :) \n \n\n You going to care for them all? \n \n\n God gave this *respons-able opportunity* to the mother/father of each baby.\n \n\n Did you adopt any unwanted babies? \n \n\n Unofficially, actually more than several dozen :) \n \n\n Foster any children who'd been left in state care? No? Well, damn.\n \n\n Actually, in 3 seperate neighborhoods, we took-in pre-schoolers (whose Drug-impregnated mothers physically/emotionaly-Abandoned them). \n And we housed/clothed each little boy/girl; and fed them our own home-cooked meals, and nurtured each of their *phenomenal*-minds. And they were *each* very welcomed :) ~ and returned for years. (Amongst our friends, one of my nicknames being \"Mother Teresa#2\" (& we're not catholic)).\n \n\n Mind you, I'm not saying you shouldn't advocate against abortion. Just pointing out that it's somewhat hypocritcal. \n \n\n Yes, we are doing all we can to live 'a life, *nobly worth living*. And you? :) \n \n\n You lot often seem more focused on a bunch of fertilized cells, instead of the human beings that are ALREADY here and dying. Guess it's simpler, y'know? \n \n\n Pzzzzzzzt - another wrong mind-read. \n \n Actually, (aside being a loving-mother, plus our other positive Community-contributions, some I mentioned briefly here in this post already) - I have as well *Advocated for each individual*, whose arrogant-Doc. wanted to dis-connect \"Life-support\". And in this latter area, I have been published in 2 major news-papers, by the families who actually appreciated :) me for my contributions. \n \n And what nourishing? IDEAS, for *constructive human development* have you :)  to bring to the table/feast - And thank you!, in advance. \n \n Annie",
