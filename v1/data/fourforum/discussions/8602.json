   "A position paper from the American Academy of Pediatrics in the current edition of Pediatrics. This is the summary/commentary. \n \n I think this is interesting in light of recent court decisions that are based on marriage and procreation.\n \n \n \nIn all its work, the AAP is committed to calling attention to the inextricable link between the health and wellbeing of all children, the support and encouragement of all parents, and the protection of strong family relationships. This analysis was prepared to bring to light the legal, financial, and psychosocial ramifications of recent and proposed public-policy initiatives affecting samegender parents and their children. \n \n Civil marriage is a legal status that promotes healthy families by conferring a powerful set of rights, benefits, and protections that cannot be obtained by other means. Civil marriage can help foster financial and legal security, psychosocial stability, and an augmented sense of societal acceptance and support. Legal recognition of a spouse can increase the ability of adult couples to provide and care for one another and fosters a nurturing and secure environment for their children. Children who are raised by civilly married parents benefit from the legal status granted to their parents. \n \n Gay and lesbian people have been raising children for many years and will continue to do so in the future; the issue is whether these children will be raised by parents who have the rights, benefits, and protections of civil marriage. Same-gender couples are denied the right to civil marriage in every state except Massachusetts and the right to civil union except in Connecticut and Vermont. The federal government and other state governments do not recognize those civil marriages and civil unions. \n \n There is ample evidence to show that children raised by same-gender parents fare as well as those raised by heterosexual parents. More than 25 years of research have documented that there is no relationship between parents' sexual orientation and any measure of a child's emotional, psychosocial, and behavioral adjustment. These data have demonstrated no risk to children as a result of growing up in a family with 1 or more gay parents. Conscientious and nurturing adults, whether they are men or women, heterosexual or homosexual, can be excellent parents. The rights, benefits, and protections of civil marriage can further strengthen these families.\n\n \n edited format for clarity",

   "some fun facts from the same article,\n \n \n...Numerous demographers report that this number, although significant, is still likely to be a considerable undercount of the actual number of same-gender partner households in the United States. Despite the likelihood of an undercount and the legal restrictions on the Census Bureau resulting from the enactment of DOMA, Census 2000 represents the most\n comprehensive source of data on same-gender partnered households to date, allowing demographers to analyze data at the national, state, city/town, and community levels.\n \n Specific Census 2000 findings include:\n \n \u0095 Same-gender couples live in 99.3% of all US counties.\n \u0095 Same-gender couples are raising children in at least 96% of all US counties.\n \u0095 Nearly one quarter of all same-gender couples are raising children.\n \u0095 Nationwide, 34.3% of lesbian couples are raising children, and 22.3% of gay male couples are raising children (compared with 45.6% of married heterosexual and 43.1% of unmarried heterosexual couples raising children).\n \u0095 Vermont has the largest aggregation of same gender couples (_1% of all households) followed by California, Washington, Massachusetts, and Oregon.\n \u0095 Regionally, the South has the highest percentage of same-gender couples who are parents; 36.1% of lesbian couples and 23.9% of gay couples in the South are raising children.\n \u0095 The second highest percentage is seen in the Midwest, where 34.7% of lesbian couples and 22.9% of gay couples are parenting children.\n \u0095 In the West, 33.1% of lesbian couples and 21.1% of gay couples are parents.\n \u0095 In the Northeast, 32.6% of lesbian couples and 21.7% of gay couples are raising children.\n \u0095 The states with the highest percentages of lesbian couples raising children are Mississippi (43.8%), South Dakota and Utah (42.3% each), and Texas (40.9%).\n \u0095 The states with the highest percentages of gay male couples raising children are Alaska (36%), South Dakota (33%), Mississippi (31%), and Idaho and Utah (30% each).\n \u0095 Six percent of same-gender couples are raising children who have been adopted compared with 5.1% of heterosexual married couples and 2.6% of unmarried heterosexual couples.\n \u0095 Eight percent of same-gender parents are raising children with special health care needs, compared with 8.3% of heterosexual unmarried parents and 5.8% of heterosexual married parents. \n \u0095 Of same-gender partners raising children, 41.1% have been together for 5 years or longer, whereas 19.9% of heterosexual unmarried couples have stayed together for that duration.\n \n",

   "I wish the article defined, specifically, what it means by the phrase \"gay couple.\" (it uses that phrase over and over for all these stats.) For instance, I find it hard to believe that a 1/4 of gay couples are raising kids. Maybe a 1/4 of long-term-together gay couples. Or monogamous ones. But \"gay couple\" could be anything from \"been-together-for-40-years\" to \"one-night-rendezvous-yes-you-can-call-me-tomorrow.\" The end says 41.1% have been together 5 or more years, which leads one to believe that most of what constitutes a \"gay couple\" for that article is pretty wide open, meaning that some of them are probably single people with children that happen to be gay and sleep around. After all, nearly 60% of them are relationships under 5 years.\n \n \"Hey! We've had 2 gay rendezvous. sure we're a couple!

Why do you shoot first and ask questions later?\n The link to the article is right here  \n Read the whole thing, bonehead, before you spew.\n \n Why do you find those facts hard to believe? You have preconceived notions and when presented with facts, you dismiss them. That's called bigotry. The article said these are the best stats available and are likely on the low side. The term \"gay couple\" refers to male same-sex couple as opposed to lesbian. THe definition is from the Census Bureau. For the opposite sex married and unmarried couples the rules were the same and they \"could be anything from \"been-together-for-40-years\" to \"one-night-rendezvous-yes-you-can-call-me-tomorrow.\" That's is simply uncalled for venom.\n \n \n \nIn 1990, the US Census Bureau began allowing individuals to describe another same-gender household member with whom the respondent has a relationship as an \"unmarried partner.\" By comparing the gender of the household members who identified themselves as unmarried partners, the Census Bureau was able to identify unmarried couples made up of 2 men or 2 women. The 1990 count of same-gender unmarried-partner couples\n was 145 130.1 \n\n \n \n \n\n The end says 41.1% have been together 5 or more years, which leads one to believe that most of what constitutes a \"gay couple\" for that article is pretty wide open, meaning that some of them are probably single people with children that happen to be gay and sleep around. After all, nearly 60% of them are relationships under 5 years. \n\n \n Why can't you accept these are long term relationships? There is no word for us. We can't get married. The term \"unmarried partner\" refers to opposite sex couples as well. Do you assume they use the term loosely and are promiscuous? These are not single people. The single parents are accounted for separately. Nothing was left \"pretty wide open\" but your slack jaw. \n \n \n\n \"Hey! We've had 2 gay rendezvous. sure we're a couple! Hey, let me indicate that way on the census!\"\n \n\n \n Why are you such a XXXXX? Why would you say such a thing? Why would you not think we would take our relationships as seriously as straight folks. I was one of those people who marked \"unmarried partner\" and I was in a monogamous relationship for 4 years (now ten).

   "jyoshu,\n You and I have been chatting on here for years now. Although I don't post much anymore, I am still lurking and reading. You have learned nothing. Your mind has not changed one bit. If is not to learn, why are you here. You aren't learning anything. You posts today look just like they did when you first posted here.\n \n In all the time I have been reading your posts, I have been with the same guy. This past May marked 6 years, and back in September we had a ceremony to make our commitment public in front of our friends, family and coworkers. Guess what, despite some rough times where we had some financial problems. We have only had one fight in 6 years. We never argue, we support each other. And if you ask either of us at any given time we will tell you.. we do still love each other.\n \n We have been faithful, dedicated and committed to the goal. To be togther till death due us part.\n \n I know that all shocks you, but it is real and by the way, we are both pretty happy. We have our complaints about each other and what couple doesn't, but overall. I am very content and very happy. I am happy to wake up to that same face each day and look forward to seeing it, for the rest of my life.\n \n Shocked.......your years of posts about gays suggest you don't even believe me. I know, I have been reading your post for how long. I have watched you spin like a top ( no pun).....you need to accept gay couples are not going away. We are here and not going to shut up. \n \n THE BIG QUESTION FOR YOU!!!!!\n \n \n What is your goal? What do you hope to gain by constantly, everyday posting on this site the negatives of gays? WHat do you thin will change? What do you think will happen? Wouldn't you rather see us protected, safe and happy in our relationships? WOuldn't you rather see our children protected? What is it you think you are accomplishing and do you help or hurt more people in the process?\n \n I suggest and can prove....you hurt more people than you help!\n \n Get over it.",
