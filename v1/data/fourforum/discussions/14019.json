   "this wont seem quite like an abortion debate at first but they are diffidently connected. you see, over the years as humans have become smarter and smarter and lived longer and longer the human population limit has been getting closer. while many of you will probably not have any premonitions about this here is the summary: when too many humans exist on earth to the point where the needs for homes, food and production of modern day \"semi-needs\" (things that are basely relied on in modern society but not necessary for our survival) do not all match up, for example, if you have 10 miles of land and 10 matched pairs of people and to support them you need 300 feet for housing and 1000 ft for farming, eventually as the population increases more and more land will be used up until its all gone.now humans have always given this situation simply expanded over more land. but now lets picture this land as flying threw space millions of light years from another piece of land, let alone a habitable one, and you will have a pretty good estimate of the on coming over population problem to be. we already have examples of it on smaller scales. look at a lot of third world country's. plenty of people but not enough food or houses to care for them all. and then think about what happens when the water runs out. the thing all life in existence can simply not live without indefinably. this is the sort of thing that leads to deserts in smaller areas, but on a global scale it could create a planet like mars.",

In industrialized countries today, the population is almost stagnant as young people have fewer and fewer children. 1 Billion people live in industrialized countries. Their expansion averages ~ 0.25%/year. In developing countries, the rate is 1.5%/year. \n The UN population projections put the worst case population to be 14Billion by 2100. The low trajectory puts our peak population at 7.5Billion in 2040 and declining after that while the medium trajectory puts the peak population at 9.2Billion in 2075 before declining.\n As the education level increases in the world, the fertility rate decreases.

Adolphus Knopf, a member of Margaret Sanger's American Birth Control League (ABCL), which along with other groups eventually became known as Planned Parenthood.\n \n Sanger's other colleagues included avowed and sophisticated racists. One, Lothrop Stoddard, was a Harvard graduate and the author of The Rising Tide of Color against White Supremacy. Stoddard was something of a Nazi enthusiast who described the eugenic practices of the Third Reich as \"scientific\" and \"humanitarian.\" And Dr. Harry Laughlin, another Sanger associate and board member for her group, spoke of purifying America's human \"breeding stock\" and purging America's \"bad strains.\" These \"strains\" included the \"shiftless, ignorant, and worthless class of antisocial whites of the South.\"\n \n Not to be outdone by her followers, Margaret Sanger spoke of sterilizing those she designated as \"unfit,\" a plan she said would be the \"salvation of American civilization.: And she also spike of those who were \"irresponsible and reckless,\" among whom she included those \" whose religious scruples prevent their exercising control over their numbers.\" She further contended that \"there is no doubt in the minds of all thinking people that the procreation of this group should be stopped.\" That many Americans of African origin constituted a segment of Sanger considered \"unfit\" cannot be easily refuted.\n \n While Planned Parenthood's current apologists try to place some distance between the eugenics and birth control movements, history definitively says otherwise. The eugenic theme figured prominently in the Birth Control Review, which Sanger founded in 1917. She published such articles as \"Some Moral Aspects of Eugenics\" (June 1920), \"The Eugenic Conscience\" (February 1921), \"The purpose of Eugenics\" (December 1924), \"Birth Control and Positive Eugenics\" (July 1925), \"Birth Control: The True Eugenics\" (August 1928), and many others.\n \n These eugenic and racial origins are hardly what most people associate with the modern Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA), which gave its Margaret Sanger award to the late Dr. Martin Luther King in 1966, and whose current president, Faye Wattleton, is black, a former nurse, and attractive.\n \n Though once a social pariah group, routinely castigated by religious and government leaders, the PPFA is now an established, high-profile, well-funded organization with ample organizational and ideological support in high places of American society and government.

MALTHUS\n \n THE MALTHUSIAN PRINCIPLE\n \n \"The power of population is indefinitely greater than the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man. Population, when unchecked, increases in a geometrical ratio. Subsistence increases only in an arithmetical ratio. A slight acquaintance with numbers will shew the immensity of the first power in comparison of the second. By that law of our nature which makes food necessary to the life of man, the effects of these two unequal powers must be kept equal. This implies a strong and constantly operating check on population from the difficulty of subsistence. This difficulty must fall somewhere and must necessarily be severely felt by a large portion of mankind. Through the animal and vegetable kingdoms, nature has scattered the seeds of life abroad with the most profuse and liberal hand. She has been comparatively sparing in the room and the nourishment necessary to rear them. The germs of existence contained in this spot of earth, with ample food, and ample room to expand in, would fill millions of worlds in the course of a few thousand years. Necessity, that imperious all pervading law of nature, restrains them within the prescribed bounds. The race of plants and the race of animals shrink under this great restrictive law. And the race of man cannot, by any efforts of reason, escape from it. Among plants and animals its effects are waste of seed, sickness, and premature death. Among mankind, misery and vice. ... This natural inequality of the two powers of population and of production in the earth, and that great law of our nature which must constantly keep their effects equal, form the great difficulty that to me appears insurmountable in the way to the perfectibility of society.\"\n \n Source: T. Robert Malthus, \"An Essay on the Principle of Population\" (1798), Chapter One\n \n LARGE FAMILIES AND NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE POOR\n \n \"Impelled to the increase of his species by an equally powerful instinct, reason interrupts his (i.e. man's) career and asks him whether he may not bring beings into the world for whom he cannot provide the means of subsistence. In a state of equality, this would be the simple question. In the present state of society, other considerations occur. Will he not lower his rank in life? Will he not subject himself to greater difficulties than he at present feels? Will he not be obliged to labour harder? and if he has a large family, will his utmost exertions enable him to support them?

Your proposed Society 'enquiring into the facts of human heredity' would have awfully laborious work ... As it is, there is much concealment of insanity and wickedness in families; and there would be more if there was a register. But the greatest difficulty, I think, would be in deciding who deserved to be on the register. How few are above mediocrity in health, strength, morals and intellect; and how difficult to judge on these latter heads. ...

We civilised men, on the other hand, do our utmost to check the process of elimination; we build asylums for the imbecile, the maimed, and the sick; we institute poor-laws; and our medical men exert their utmost skill to save the life of every one to the last moment. There is reason to believe that vaccination has preserved thousands, who from a weak constitution would formerly have succumbed to small-pox. Thus the weak members of civilised societies propagate their kind. No one who has attended to the breeding of domestic animals will doubt that this must be highly injurious to the race of man. It is surprising how soon a want of care, or care wrongly directed, leads to the degeneration of a domestic race; but excepting in the case of man itself, hardly any one is so ignorant as to allow his worst animals to breed.\n \n The aid which we feel impelled to give to the helpless is mainly an incidental result of the instinct of sympathy, which was originally acquired as part of the instincts, but subsequently rendered, in the manner previously indicated, more tender and more widely diffused. Nor could we check our sympathy, even at the urging of hard reason, without deterioration in the noblest part of our nature. The surgeon may harden him self whilst performing an operation, for he knows that he is acting for the good of his patient; but if we were intentionally to neglect the weak and helpless, it could only be for a contingent benefit, with an overwhelming present evil. We must therefore bear the undoubtedly bad effects of the weak surviving and propagating their kind; but there appears to be at least one check in steady action, namely that the weaker and inferior members of society do not marry so freely as the sound; and this check might be indefinitely increased by the weak in body or mind refraining from marriage.\"\n \n Source: Charles Darwin, The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex. 2nd Ed. (London: John Murray, 1882), Chapter V, pp. 133-34.\n \n \"A most important obstacle in civilised countries to an increase in the number of men of a superior class has been strongly insisted on by Mr. Greg and Mr. Galton, namely, the fact that the very poor and reckless, who are often degraded by vice, almost invariably marry early, whilst the careful and frugal, who are generally otherwise virtuous, marry late in life, so that they may be able to support themselves and their children in comfort. Those who marry early produce within a given period not only a greater number of generations, but, as shewn by Dr. Duncan, they produce many more children. The children, moreover, that are borne by mothers during the prime of life are heavier and larger, and therefore probably more vigorous, than those born at other periods. Thus the reckless, degraded, and often vicious members of society, tend to increase at a quicker rate than the provident and generally virtuous members. ... In the eternal 'struggle for existence,' it would be the inferior and less favoured race that prevailed&#8212;and prevailed by virtue not of its good qualities but of its faults.\"\n \n Source: Charles Darwin, The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex. 2nd Ed.

Apes are much given to imitation, as are the lowest savages; and the simple fact previously referred to, that after a time no animal can be caught in the same place by the same sort of trap, shows that animals learn by experience, and imitate the caution of others. Now, if some one man in a tribe, more sagacious than the others, invented a new snare or weapon, or other means of attack or defence, the plainest self-interest, without the assistance of much reasoning power, would prompt the other members to imitate him; and all would thus profit. The habitual practice of each new art must likewise in some slight degree strengthen the intellect. If the new invention were an important one, the tribe would increase in number, spread, and supplant other tribes. In a tribe thus rendered more numerous there would always be a rather greater chance of the birth of other superior and inventive members. If such men left children to inherit their mental superiority, the chance of the birth of still more ingenious members would be somewhat better, and in a very small tribe decidedly better.\"\n \n Source: Charles Darwin, The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex. 2nd Ed.

So it will be with the intellectual faculties, since the somewhat abler men in each grade of society succeed rather better than the less able, and consequently increase in number, if not otherwise prevented.

Before long the population may actually diminish. This is already happening in the most intelligent sections of the most intelligent nations; government opposition to birth-control propaganda gives a biological advantage to stupidity, since it is chiefly stupid people who governments succeed in keeping in ignorance. Before long, birth-control may become nearly universal among the white races; it will then not deteriorate their quality, but only diminish their numbers, at a time when uncivilized races are still prolific and are preserved from a high death-rate by white science.\n \n This situation will lead to a tendency --- already shown by the French --- to employ more prolific races as mercenaries. Governments will oppose the teaching of birth-control among Africans, for fear of losing recruits. The result will be an immense numerical inferiority of the white races, leading probably to their extermination in a mutiny of mercenaries.\"\n \n Source: Bertrand Russell, \"ICARUS or the Future of Science\" (1924)\n \n ON EUGENICS\n \n \"Thee might observe incidentally that if the state paid for child-bearing it might and ought to require a medical certificate that the parents were such as to give a reasonable result of a healthy child -- this would afford a very good inducement to some sort of care for the race, and gradually as public opinion became educated by the law, it might react on the law and make that more stringent, until one got to some state of things in which there would be a little genuine care for the race, instead of the present haphazard higgledy-piggledy ways.\"\n \n Source: Letter of Bertrand Russell to Alys Pearsall Smith\n \n \"We may perhaps assume that, if people grow less superstitious, government will acquire the right to sterilize those who are not considered desirable as parents. This power will be used, at first, to diminish imbecility, a most desirable object. But probably, in time, opposition to the government will be taken to prove imbecility, so that rebels of all kinds will be sterilized. Epileptics, consumptives, dipsomaniacs and so on will gradually be included; in the end, there will be a tendency to include all who fail to pass the usual school examinations. The result will be to increase the average intelligence; in the long run, it may be greatly increased. But probably the effect upon really exceptional intelligence will be bad.\n \n Eugenics has, of course, more ambitious possibilities in a more distant future. It may aim not only at eliminating undesired types, but at increasing desired types. Moral standards may alter so as to make it possible for one man to be the sire of a vast progeny by many different mothers. ... If eugenics reached the point where it could increase desired types, it would not be the types desired by present-day Eugenists that would be increased, but rather the type desired by the average official. Prime Ministers, Bishops, and others whom the State considers desirable might become the fathers of half the next generation. Whether this would be an improvement it is not for me to say, as I have no hope of ever becoming either a Bishop or a Prime Minister.\n \n If we knew enough about heredity to determine, within limits, what sort of population we would have, the matter would of course be in the hands of State officials, presumably elderly medical men.

He has devoted a very large amount of energy and capacity to the vivid and convincing presentation of this idea, and to its courageous propagation. ... Indeed, Mr. Galton has drawn up certain definite proposals. He has suggested that \"noble families\" should collect \"fine specimens of humanity\" around them, employing these fine specimens in menial occupations of a light and comfortable sort, that will leave a sufficient portion of their energies free for the multiplication of their superior type.\"\n \n Source: H.G.

They will be artists in reality, with a passion for simplicity and directness and an impatience of confusion and inefficiency. The determining frame of their ethics ... will be the elaboration of that future world state to which all things are pointing. ... It is manifest that a reconstructed ethical system ... will give very different values from those given by the existing system ... the ethical system of these men of the New Republic, the ethical system which will dominate the world state, will be shaped primarily to favour the procreation of what is fine and efficient and beautiful in humanity - beautiful and strong bodies, clear and powerful minds, and a growing body of knowledge - and to check the procreation of base and servile types, of fear-driven and cowardly souls, of all that is mean and ugly and bestial in the souls, bodies, or habits of men. To do the latter is to do the former; the two things are inseparable.\n \n In the new vision death is no inexplicable horror, no pointless terminal terror to the miseries of life, it is the end of all pain of life, the end of the bitterness of failure, the merciful obliteration of the weak and silly and pointless things. The new ethics will hold life to be a privilege and a responsibility ... and the alternative in right conduct between living fully, beautifully, and efficiently will be to die. For a multitude of contemptible and silly creatures, fear-driven and helpless and useless, unhappy or hatefully happy in the midst of squalid dishonour, feeble, ugly, inefficient, born of unrestrained lusts, and increasing and multiplying through sheer incontinence and stupidity, the men of the New Republic will have little pity and less benevolence.\n \n The men of the New Republic will not be squeamish, either, in facing or inflicting death, because they will have a fuller sense of the possibilities of life than we possess. They will have an ideal that will make killing worth while.\n \n The pre-eminent value of sexual questions in morality lies in the fact that the lives which will constitute the future are involved. If they are not involved, if we can dissociate this relationship from this issue, then sexual questions become of no more importance than the morality of one's deportment at chess, or the general morality of outdoor games. ... The men of the New Republic ... will rout out and illuminate urban rookeries and all places where the base can drift to multiply; they will contrive a land legislation that will keep the black, or yellow, or mean-white squatter on the move; ... so that childbearing shall cease to be a hopeful speculation for the unemployed poor; ... This thing, this euthanasia of the weak and sensual, is possible.

   "Your statements are pathetic. Here is another summation addressing all of your ridiculous points, and \"in context,\" for your besieged mind to try to follow. I have highlighted Dr. King's statement for you, upon Dr. Sanger's death, along with a couple of references that I'm sure you will pretend you never read. Such as the Nazis' opposition to abortion (your views strikingly similar to theirs as readers can see below), and the respect Dr. Sanger enjoyed from other great civil rights leaders across \"race,\" in addition to Dr. King, like Mahatma Gandhi, for one, and Shidzue Kato, the foremost family planning advocate in Japan. Do you think Kato was racistly attempting to exterminate her fellow Japanese? What about all the white people Dr. Sanger's work addressed? Was she set on killing off whites? Do you think you're smarter and more concerned about African Americans than Dr. King? \n \n So much your depraved, ridiculously contrived deceitful ramblings about the founder of Planned Parenthood.\n \n \n\n The Truth about Margaret Sanger\n \n Margaret Sanger gained worldwide renown, respect, and admiration for founding the American birth control movement and, later, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, as well as for developing and encouraging family planning efforts throughout the international community.\n Among her many visionary accomplishments as a social reformer, Sanger\n \n &#8226; established the principles that a woman's right to control her body is the foundation of her human rights; that every person should be able to decide when or whether to have a child; that every child should be wanted and loved; and that women are entitled to sexual pleasure and fulfillment just as men are\n \n &#8226; brought about the reversal of federal and state \"Comstock laws\" that prohibited publication and distribution of information about sex, sexuality, contraception, and human reproduction\n \n &#8226; helped establish the contemporary American model for the protection of civil rights through nonviolent civil disobedience &#8212; a model that later propelled the civil rights, anti-war, women's rights, and AIDS-action movements\n \n &#8226; created access to birth control for low-income, minority, and immigrant women\n \n &#8226; expanded the American concept of volunteerism and grassroots organizing by setting up a network of volunteer-driven family planning centers across the U.S.\n \n Sanger also entertained some popular ideas of her own time that are out of keeping with our thinking today. Finding it easier to undermine her character than to confront the message she conveyed, the anti-family planning movement has seized upon some of these ideas, taken them out of context, and exaggerated and distorted them in order to discredit Sanger and the organization she founded.\n \n Not content with exaggeration and distortion, anti-choice activists have also fabricated and attributed to Sanger points of view that she, in fact, found abhorrent. This fact sheet is designed to separate fact from fiction and to further explain Sanger's views and the background against which they must be judged.\n \n Sanger and Eugenics\n \n Eugenics is the science of improving hereditary qualities by socially controlling human reproduction. Unable to foment popular opposition to Margaret Sanger's accomplishments and the organization she founded, Sanger's critics attempt to discredit them by intentionally confusing her views on \"fitness\" with eugenics, racism, and anti-Semitism. Margaret Sanger was not a racist, an anti-Semite, or a eugenicist. Eugenicists, like the Nazis, were opposed to the use of abortion and contraception by healthy and &#8220;fit&#8221; women (Grossmann, 1995). In fact, Sanger&#8217;s books were among the very first burned by the Nazis in their campaign against family planning (&#8220;Sanger on Exhibit,&#8221; 1999/2000). Sanger actually helped several Jewish women and men and others escape the Nazi regime in Germany (&#8220;Margaret Sanger and the &#8216;Refugee Department&#8217;,&#8221; 1993). Sanger's disagreement with the eugenicists of her day is clear from her remarks in The Birth Control Review of February 1919:\n \n Eugenists imply or insist that a woman's first duty is to the state; we contend that her duty to herself is her first duty to the state. We maintain that a woman possessing an adequate knowledge of her reproductive functions is the best judge of the time and conditions under which her child should be brought into the world. We further maintain that it is her right, regardless of all other considerations, to determine whether she shall bear children or not, and how many children she shall bear if she chooses to become a mother (1919a).\n \n Margaret Sanger clearly identified with the issues of health and fitness that concerned the early 20th-century eugenics movement, which was enormously popular and well-respected during the 1920s and '30s, when treatments for many hereditary and disabling conditions were unknown. However, Sanger always believed that reproductive decisions should be made on an individual and not a social or cultural basis, and she consistently repudiated any racial application of eugenics principles. For example, Sanger vocally opposed the racial stereotyping that effected passage of the Immigration Act of 1924, on the grounds that intelligence and other inherited traits vary by individual and not by group.\n \n In 1927, the eugenics movement reached the height of its popularity when the U.S. Supreme Court, in Buck v. Bell, held that it was constitutional to involuntarily sterilize the developmentally disabled, the insane, or the uncontrollably epileptic. Oliver Wendell Holmes, supported by Louis Brandeis and six other justices, wrote the opinion.\n \n Although Sanger uniformly repudiated the racist exploitation of eugenics principles, she agreed with the \"progressives\" of her day who favored\n \n &#8226; incentives for the voluntary hospitalization and/or sterilization of people with untreatable, disabling, hereditary conditions\n \n &#8226; the adoption and enforcement of stringent regulations to prevent the immigration of the diseased and \"feebleminded\" into the U.S.\n \n &#8226; placing so-called illiterates, paupers, unemployables, criminals, prostitutes, and dope-fiends on farms and open spaces as long as necessary for the strengthening and development of moral conduct\n \n Planned Parenthood Federation of America finds these views objectionable and outmoded. Nevertheless, anti-family planning activists continue to attack Sanger, who has been dead for over 30 years, because she is an easier target than the unassailable reputation of PPFA and the contemporary family planning movement. However, attempts to discredit the family planning movement because its early 20th-century founder was not a perfect model of early 21st-century values is like disavowing the Declaration of Independence because its author, Thomas Jefferson, bought and sold slaves.\n \n Sanger's Outreach to the African-American Community\n \n In 1930, Sanger opened a family planning clinic in Harlem that sought to enlist support for contraceptive use and to bring the benefits of family planning to women who were denied access to their city's health and social services. Staffed by a black physician and black social worker, the clinic was endorsed by The Amsterdam News (the powerful local newspaper), the Abyssinian Baptist Church, the Urban League, and the black community's elder statesman, W.E.B. DuBois.\n \n Beginning in 1939, DuBois also served on the advisory council for Sanger's \"Negro Project,\" which was a \"unique experiment in race-building and humanitarian service to a race subjected to discrimination, hardship, and segregation&#8221; (Chesler, 1992). The Negro Project served African-Americans in the rural South. Other leaders of the African-American community who were involved in the project included Mary McLeod Bethune, founder of the National Council of Negro Women, and Adam Clayton Powell Jr., pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem.\n \n The Negro Project was also endorsed by prominent white Americans who were involved in social justice efforts at this time, including Eleanor Roosevelt, the most visible and compassionate supporter of racial equality in her era; and the medical philanthropists, Albert and Mary Lasker, whose financial support made the project possible.\n \n A passionate opponent of racism, Sanger predicted in 1942 that the \"Negro question\" would be foremost on the country's domestic agenda after World War II. Her accomplishments on behalf of the African-American community were unchallengeable during her lifetime and remain so today. In 1966, the year Sanger died, the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. said:\n \n There is a striking kinship between our movement and Margaret Sanger's early efforts. . . . Our sure beginning in the struggle for equality by nonviolent direct action may not have been so resolute without the tradition established by Margaret Sanger and people like her.\n \n Charges of racism against Sanger are most often made by anti-choice activists who are unfamiliar with the history of the African-American community or with Margaret Sanger's collegial relationship with that community's leaders. The tangled fabric of lies and manipulation woven by anti-choice activists around the issues of class, race, and family planning continues to be embroidered today, more than three-quarters of a century after the family planning movement began.\n \n Published Statements That Distort or Misquote Margaret Sanger\n \n Through the years, a number of alleged Sanger quotations, or allegations about her, have surfaced with regularity in anti-family planning publications. The following are samples of especially pernicious distortions, misattributions, or outright lies that Margaret Sanger's enemies continue to circulate.\n \n &#8220;More children from the fit, less from the unfit &#8212; that is the chief issue in birth control.&#8221; A quotation falsely attributed to Margaret Sanger, this statement was made by the editors of American Medicine in a review of an article by Sanger. The editorial from which this appeared, as well as Sanger's article, \"Why Not Birth Control Clinics in America?\" (1919b), were reprinted side-by-side in the May 1919 Birth Control Review.\n \n &#8220;The mass of ignorant Negroes still breed carelessly and disastrously, so that the increase among Negroes, even more than the increase among whites, is from that portion of the population least intelligent and fit, and least able to rear their children properly.&#8221; Another quotation falsely attributed to Margaret Sanger, this was actually written for the June 1932 issue of The Birth Control Review by W.E.B. DuBois, founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Taken out of the context of his discussion about the effects of birth control on the balance between quality-of-life considerations and race-survival issues for African-Americans, Dubois' language seems insensitive by today's standards.\n \n &#8220;Blacks, soldiers, and Jews are a menace to the race.&#8221; This fabricated quotation, falsely attributed to Sanger, was concocted in the late 1980s. The alleged source is the April 1933 Birth Control Review (Sanger ceased editing the Review in 1929). That issue contains no article or letter by Sanger.\n \n &#8220;To create a race of thoroughbreds . . .&#8221; This remark, again attributed originally to Sanger, was made by Dr. Edward A. Kempf and has been cited out of context and with distorted meaning. Dr. Kempf, a progressive physician, was actually arguing for state endowment of maternal and infant care clinics. In her book The Pivot of Civilization, Sanger quoted Dr. Kempf's argument about how environment may improve human excellence:\n \n Society must make life worth the living and the refining for the individual by conditioning him to love and to seek the love-object in a manner that reflects a constructive effect upon his fellow-men and by giving him suitable opportunities. The virility of the automatic apparatus is destroyed by excessive gormandizing or hunger, by excessive wealth or poverty, by excessive work or idleness, by sexual abuse or intolerant prudishness. The noblest and most difficult art of all is the raising of human thoroughbreds (1969).\n \n It was in this spirit that Sanger used the phrase, \"Birth Control: To Create a Race of Thoroughbreds,\" as a banner on the November 1921 issue of the Birth Control Review. (Differing slogans on the theme of voluntary family planning sometimes appeared under the title of The Review, e.g., \"Dedicated to the Cause of Voluntary Motherhood,\" January 1928.)\n \n &#8220;The most merciful thing that the large family does to one of its infant members is to kill it.&#8221; This statement is taken out of context from Margaret Sanger's Woman and the New Race (1920). Sanger was making an ironic comment &#8212; not a prescriptive one &#8212; about the horrifying rate of infant mortality among large families of early 20th-century urban America. The statement, as grim as the conditions that prompted Sanger to make it, accompanied this chart, illustrating the infant death rate in 1920:\n \n Deaths During First Year\n 1st born children 23% 7th born children 31%\n 2nd born children 20% 8th born children 33%\n 3rd born children 21% 9th born children 35%\n 4th born children 23% 10th born children 41%\n 5th born children 26% 11th born children 51%\n 6th born children 31% 12th born children 60%\n \n &#8220;We do not want word to get out that we want to exterminate the Negro population.&#8221; Sanger was aware of African-American concerns, passionately argued by Marcus Garvey in the 1920s, that birth control was a threat to the survival of the black race. This statement, which acknowledges those fears, is taken from a letter to Clarence J. Gamble, M.D., a champion of the birth control movement. In that letter, Sanger describes her strategy to allay such apprehensions. A larger portion of the letter makes Sanger's meaning clear:\n \n It seems to me from my experience . . . in North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, and Texas, that while the colored Negroes have great respect for white doctors, they can get closer to their own members and more or less lay their cards on the table. . . . They do not do this with the white people, and if we can train the Negro doctor at the clinic, he can go among them with enthusiasm and with knowledge, which, I believe, will have far-reaching results. . . . His work, in my opinion, should be entirely with the Negro profession and the nurses, hospital, social workers, as well as the County's white doctors. His success will depend upon his personality and his training by us.\n The minister's work is also important, and also he should be trained, perhaps by the Federation, as to our ideals and the goal that we hope to reach. We do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population, and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs (1939).\n \n &#8220;As early as 1914 Margaret Sanger was promoting abortion, not for white middle-class women, but against 'inferior races' &#8212; black people, poor people, Slavs, Latins, and Hebrews were 'human weeds.'&#8221; This allegation about Margaret Sanger appears in an anonymous flyer, \"Facts About Planned Parenthood,\" that is circulated by anti-family planning activists. Margaret Sanger, who passionately believed in a woman's right to control her body, never \"promoted\" abortion because it was illegal and dangerous throughout her lifetime. She urged women to use contraceptives so that they would not be at risk for the dangers of illegal, back-alley abortion. Sanger never described any ethnic community as an 'inferior race' or as 'human weeds.' In her lifetime, Sanger won the respect of international figures of all races, including the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.; Mahatma Gandhi; Shidzue Kato, the foremost family planning advocate in Japan; and Lady Dhanvanthi Rama Rau of India &#8212; all of whom were sensitive to issues of race.\n \n The Rising Tide of Color Against White World Supremacy\n \n This is the title of a book falsely attributed to Sanger. It was written by Lothrop Stoddard and reviewed by Havelock Ellis in the October 1920 issue of The Birth Control Review. Its general topic, the international politics of race relations in the first decades of the century, is one in which Sanger was not involved. Her interest, insofar as she allowed a review of Stoddard's book to be published in The Birth Control Review, was in the overall health and quality of life of all races and not in tensions between them. Ellis's review was critical of the Stoddard book and of distinctions based on race or ethnicity alone.\n \n For Further Reading\n Chesler, Ellen. (1992).

So here it is, and big surprise your propaganda piece was created by no other than Planned parenthood itself. Big surprise they would endorse and defend Sanger. emoticon_rolleyes The Truth about Margaret Sanger | Planned Parenthood Affiliates New Jersey\n \n Now, if you want the REAL truth about Margaret Sanger, here's an article that will give it to you. The link is below. emoticon_xgood\n \n THE TRUTH ABOUT MARGARET SANGER \n Wattleton's PPFA biography touts her as a friend of the \"Poor and the young\"; a nurse at Harlem Hospital; and the recipient of the 1989 Congressional Black Caucus Foundation Humanitarian Award and the World Institute of Black Communicators' 1986 Excellence in Black Communications Award. It further states she was featured in a national photography exhibit, \"I Dream A World: Portraits of Black Women Who Changed America\"; interviewed in Ebony; and was the cover story in Black Enterprise magazine. (Time published a profile of Wattleton in 1990 entitled \"Nothing Less Than Perfect.\")\n \n Her ideological orientation has received certification in the form of the Better World Society's 1989 Population Model, the 1986 American Humanist Award, and others. But surely, the spectacle of the Congressional Black Caucus awarding its humanitarian award to the black woman who presides over the organization that has hastened and justified the death of almost eight million black children since 1973 and facilitates the demise of the black family is ironic in the extreme.\n \n Killer Angel\n \n In his book, Killer Angel, George Grant says: \"Myths, according to theologian J. l. packer, are \u00d4stories made up to sanctify social patterns.' They are lies, carefully designed to reinforce a particular philosophy or morality within a culture. They are instruments of manipulation and control.\n \n Killer Angel tells the real story behind one of the biggest myths that controls our culture today\u00d1the life and legacy of Margaret Sanger, founder of Planned Parenthood. Grant exposes \"the Big Lie\" perpetuated by Sanger's followers and the organization she started.\n \n Through detailed research and concise writing, Grant unveils Sanger's true character and ideology, which included blatant racism, revolutionary socialism, sexual perversion and insatiable avarice. Grant includes direct quotes from sources such as Sanger's Birth Control Review to support his findings. His biography spans Sanger's disturbed and unhappy upbringing\u00d1which Sanger said contributed to her agitation and bitterness later in life\u00d1to her eventual fixation with drugs, alcohol and the occult.\n \n Particularly shocking was Sanger's involvement in the Eugenics movement. Grant says: \"[Sanger] was thoroughly convinced that the \u00d4inferior races' were in fact \u00d4human weeds' and a \u00d4menace to civilization.' . . . [S]he was a true believer, not simply someone who assimilated the jargon of the times\u00d1as Planned Parenthood officials would have us believe.\"\n \n Sanger died September 6, 1966, a week before her eighty-seventh birthday. Grant says: \"[She] had nearly fulfilled her early boast that she would spend every last penny of Slee's [her second husband] fortune. In the process, though, she had lost everything else: love, happiness, satisfaction, fulfillment, family, and friends. In the end, her struggle was her naught.\"\n \n The truth uncovered in grant's book has proven to be a threat to those who follow the cult of :Planned Parenthood. In fact, Killer Angel was recently banned from a public library in Toledo, Ohio. A library manager stated in a letter that, \"The author's political and social agenda, which is strongly expoused throughout the book, is not appropriate even in a critical biography of its subject.\"\n \n In response, Grant pointed out that \"The question at hand is whether librarians should be making subjective judgments about my political beliefs and the beliefs of other authors.\"\n \n By censoring Killer Angel, the library appears to be violating its own policies, which state that, \"the Library collection shall include representative materials of all races and nationalities, and all political, religious, economic and social views.\" Except Christian views, apparently.\n \n While the Toledo public library may not be interested in the information put forth in Grant's book, pro-lifers will find this biography useful and enlightening. It serves as a powerful tool in dispelling the myths surrounding a woman\u00d1considered a heroine by many\u00d1who began an organization that is responsible for the deaths of millions of unborn children.\n \n Grant states that, \"Margaret Sanger\u00d1and her heirs at Planned Parenthood . . . have thus far been able to parlay the deception into a substantial empire. But now the truth must be told. The illusion must be exposed.\" Killer Angel does an outstanding job in doing that.\n Sanger's Legacy is Reproductive Freedom and Racism\n \n Despite Margaret Sanger's contributions to birth control and hence women's freedom and empowerment, her legacy is diminished by her sympathies with eugenics. This writer says that, like many modern feminists, Sanger ignored class and race.\n \n (WOMENSENEWS)--Margaret Sanger opened the nation's first birth control clinic in 1916. For the rest of her life she worked to establish a woman's right to control her body and to decide when or whether to have a child. In 1921, she founded the American Birth Control league, the forerunner of Planned Parenthood.\n \n Her impact on contemporary society is tremendous. Enabling women to control their fertility and giving them access to contraception, as advocated by Sanger, makes it possible for women to have a broader set of life options, especially in the areas of education and employment, than if their lives are dominated by unrelieved childbearing.\n \n A recent reminder of Sanger's impact on our society came when the Equal employment Opportunity Commission found that it is illegal sex discrimination to exclude prescription contraceptives from an otherwise comprehensive health benefits plan. Sanger's efforts to provide access to contraception are at the foundation of decisions to provide equal access to prescription contraceptives and other prescriptions.\n \n Still, especially with the Bush administration, activists will have to fight to maintain access to contraception and to abortion. In April, the House of Representatives passed legislation that would establish criminal penalties for harming a fetus during the commission of a crime. While proponents of the bill say it does not include abortion, some see fetal protection legislation as an attempt to undermine abortion rights. The passage of this legislation is a reminder that the rights Margaret Sanger worked so hard to establish are tenuous rights that many would challenge.\n \n For all her positive influence, I see Sanger as a tarnished heroine whose embrace of the eugenics movement showed racial insensitivity, at best. From her associates, as well as from some of the articles that were published in Sanger's magazine, the Birth Control review, it is possible to conclude that \"racially insensitive\" is too mild a description. Indeed, some of her statements, taken in or out of context, are simply racist. And she never rebuked eugenicists who believed in improving the hereditary qualities of a race or breed by controlling mating in order to eliminate \"undesirable\" characteristics and promote \"desirable\" traits.\n \n Sanger: We Must Limit the Over-Fertility of Mentally, Physically Defective\n \n \"Our failure to segregate XXXXXX who are increasing and multiplying . . . demonstrates our foolhardy and extravagant sentimentalism,\" she wrote in the recently republished \"The Pivot of Civilization.\" This book, written in 1922, was published at a time when scientific racism had been used to assert black inferiority. Who determines who is a XXXXX? How would these XXXXXX be segregated? The ramifications of such statements are bone chilling.\n \n In a 1921 article in the Birth Control Review, Sanger wrote, \"The most urgent problem today is how to limit and discourage the over-fertility of the mentally and physically defective.\" Reviewers of one of her 1919 articles interpreted her objectives as \"More children from the fit, less from the unfit.\" Again, the question of who decides fitness is important, and it was an issue that Sanger only partly addressed. \"The undeniably feebleminded should indeed, not only be discouraged but prevented from propagating their kind,\" she wrote.\n \n Sanger advocated the mandatory sterilization of the insane and feebleminded.\" Although this does not diminish her legacy as the key force in the birth control movement, it raises questions much like those now being raised about our nation's slaveholding founders. How do we judge historical figures? How are their contributions placed in context?\n \n It is easy to see why there is some antipathy toward Sanger among people of color, considering that, given our nation's history, we are the people most frequently described as \"unfit\" and \"feebleminded.\"\n \n Many African American women have been subject to nonconsensual forced sterilization. Some did not even know that they were sterilized until they tried, unsuccessfully, to have children. In 1973, Essence Magazine published an expose of forced sterilization practices in the rural South, where racist physicians felt they were performing a service by sterilizing black women without telling them. While one cannot blame Margaret Sanger for the actions of these physician, one can certainly see why Sanger's words are especially repugnant in a racial context.\n \n The Planned Parenthood Federation of America has been protective of Margaret Sanger's reputation and defensive of allegations that she was a racist. They correctly point out that many of the attacks on Sanger come from anti-choice activists who have an interest in distorting both Sanger's work and that of Planned Parenthood. While it is understandable that Planned Parenthood would be protective of their founder's reputation, it cannot ignore the fact that Sanger edited the Birth Control review from its inception until 1929. Under her leadership, the magazine featured articles that embraced the eugenicist position. If Sanger were as anti-eugenics as Planned Parenthood says she was, she would not have printed as many articles sympathetic to eugenics as she did.BlackGenocide.org | The Truth About Margaret Sanger - Page Four",

My life is a festival if nations - I have friends and family members who are white, black, latino, asian, native american, heathen rockers, evangelicals, dykes, gays and you name it. My own child isn't even white. Finding an argument presented by a black organization not credible hardly makes me a racist. It would only be racist if I were finding the information not credible because they were black. Does the fact that you disagree with our president on matters make you a racist?\n \n Please, Archie, attempt to present reasonable arguments.\n \n \n \nSecondly, have you gone back and researched the details of her citations? Of course not, yet you assume they are valid and accurate. emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n No I have not and I assume no such thing. I frankly don't care if Sanger did support eugenics. If she did, she was wrong. Like most things and most people, I suspect the truth of her history lies in the middle. Especially since she is in the middle of a controversial argument and both sides have reason to capatalize on any info they can find to support their own convictions. I also believe, that being human and a product of her times (as we all are), she was right about some things and wrong about others (as we all are).\n \n All I am telling you, is that Marie's article is more credible - it at least provides sources that can be researched. And since you are so gung-ho on the actual link, it took me 10 second to find it. Its from the Planned Parenthood library.\n \n The Truth about Margaret Sanger | Planned Parenthood Affiliates New Jersey\n \n As to your side of the argument\n \n This one actually sites it sources, but does not draw on much of her actual writings.\n \n Concerned Women for America - The Negro Project: Margaret Sanger's Eugenic Plan for Black Americans\n \n Even Wikipedia sites it sources. Their description of Sanger's beliefs in eugenics seems like it might also be a bit more balanced. Unlike any of the other organizations I have perused through, this one really has no socio/political agenda.\n \n Margaret Sanger - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia",

Although eugenics was a prominent part of his early career, his later views in the field of marriage and family relations were based on contemporary social sciences. His approach to marriage counselling consisted of standard \"talk therapy,\" combined with practical psychology and an emphasis on marriage education.\n Eugenics, of course, has become a bete noire of today's intellectuals. My father was a Victorian man, born in 1888, and his belief was widely shared by most Progressive intellectuals of his era, including Theodore Roosevelt, Alexander Graham Bell, and, as the author notes, Margaret Sanger. Easy as it is to condemn the views of earlier generations based on todays realities, such condemnation rests on present-mindeness. \n The important question is : Why were these views held by most prominent thinkers of the time ? \n \n David Popenoe\n Professor of Sociology Emeritus\n Rutgers University\n New Brunswick, N.J.",

   "this wont seem quite like an abortion debate at first but they are diffidently connected. you see, over the years as humans have become smarter and smarter and lived longer and longer the human population limit has been getting closer. while many of you will probably not have any premonitions about this here is the summary: when too many humans exist on earth to the point where the needs for homes, food and production of modern day \"semi-needs\" (things that are basely relied on in modern society but not necessary for our survival) do not all match up, for example, if you have 10 miles of land and 10 matched pairs of people and to support them you need 300 feet for housing and 1000 ft for farming, eventually as the population increases more and more land will be used up until its all gone.now humans have always given this situation simply expanded over more land. but now lets picture this land as flying threw space millions of light years from another piece of land, let alone a habitable one, and you will have a pretty good estimate of the on coming over population problem to be. we already have examples of it on smaller scales. look at a lot of third world country's. plenty of people but not enough food or houses to care for them all. and then think about what happens when the water runs out. the thing all life in existence can simply not live without indefinably. this is the sort of thing that leads to deserts in smaller areas, but on a global scale it could create a planet like mars.\n\n It is the duty of every human being to destroy those who believe morality can be sacrificed to practicality.\n \n There are other ways to defeat your argument but nothing more than this is required.\n \n The second best way would be the point that each individual will produce enough to sustain themselves. It is not a coincidence that those who's philosophies would stagnate mankind cannot imagine a world where we are more advanced than we are now. For example you said 50 ft of land to feed someone, I can guarantee you it was more for hunter gatherers, if you had lived then would you concluded that the earth could support no more than a billion people?\n \n We are not confined to this earth, we are not confined to the energy from the sun.",
