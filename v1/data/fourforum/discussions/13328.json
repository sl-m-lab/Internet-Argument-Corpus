   "Those given to emotional rhetoric don't mind one bit if it suits their agenda.\n\n \n I'm going to write this one down because it's worth remembering.\n \n \"Gun show loophole\" \n \"Assault weapon\"\n \"Cop Killer bullets\"\n \"undetectable ceramic guns\"\n \"reasonable gun laws\"\n \"gun lobby\"\n \"illegal guns\"\n \n Are these factual items or, (What is it you now seem to hate?) \"emotional rhetoric\"?\n \n Yeah, sinjin. This is one we can agree on. Those who use \"emotional rhetoric\" don't mind one bit if it suits their agenda. \n \n Fortunately, gun rights advocates aren't LIMITED to their exclusive use like anti-gunners are because they can also rely on facts.\n \n It's a well known tactic that is starting to wear thin. Point out any factual information showing the benefits of a well armed citizenry, and see what the anti-gunners use to refute it. The facts will be completely ignored (can't use facts if there are none to support your argument) and the result will be a BARRAGE of that evil \"emotional rhetoric\" that sinjin hates so much. \n \n Although, there are a few instances of liberals attempting to use facts.....\n \n ...like the Kellerman Study. Remember? (\"A gun is 46 times more likely to be used on its owner than in self defense\") Of course, this conveniently included suicides and spousal homicide. I wonder, If a person drank anti-freeze, or had it injected by his or her spouse, was this included in the study? After all, THE END WAS THE SAME since it was the END that was desired REGARDLESS OF THE MEANS. \n \n If you weren't suicidal, or you got along with your spouse a gun was 2 TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE USED IN SELF DEFENSE.\n \n (There's also a logical test to see if this is true: If guns were truthfully 46 times more likely to be used on their owners, wouldn't we see police stations giving their weapons away to criminals? This way the cops could \"take them away and use them on their owners\", right?)\n \n So even if anti-gunners do try to use facts, you have to watch closely for \"cherry picking\" or just plain slanted studies......\n \n ...such as that VPC study that concluded that over 400 children a year were killed by guns? (Of course, 17 year old \"children\" who were shot by police in the commission of a felony were also counted in this \"study\". Remove those \"children\" who were in the act of committing violent felonies and the number suddenly dropped to LESS THAN THOSE KILLED BY FALLING OFF BICYCLES!)\n \n So you see, even though \"emotional rhetoric\" is used by both sides, anti-gunners are better served by its exclusive use, as those pesky \"facts\" have a way of screwing up their whole argument.\n \n \nThose given to emotional rhetoric don't mind one bit if it suits their agenda.\n\n \n Uh huh....and what's that saying about people in glass houses?",
