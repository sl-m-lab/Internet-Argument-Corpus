   "Latvia's president Vaira Vike-Freiberga has for the third time returned to Saema draft amendments to a bill on publishing the names of former agents of the Soviet service, the KGB. \n \n hxxp://www[.]anakstore[.]com/latvian-president-retuned-732613[.]html\n \n You know, that does not surprise me in the least. They say Vike-Freiberga was among KGB agents, just like many eminent politicians in former Soviet republics - Estonia, Lithuania and Georgia (where by the way nationalists hype over KGB data files presently). \n \n Sure, returning the law to the parliament until the time comes proves by the same token that Vike-Freiberga has a hand in the dish and merely tries to gain time. Don't you think so? \n \n By the way, why do you think Washington is so merciful to former KGB agents like Latvia's president? I think Americans will rather not scourge their vassals in Eastern Europe 'cause many of them now work for the CIA, instead of the KGB. Sure, Americans may use disclosure of the KGB data as a means of intimidation to make them collaborate with Uncle Sam. In addition to that, Vike-Freiberga's nomination for the position of the UN Secretary General indicates that the CIA wants to have loyal SG as well. They've got plenty of compromising stuff on VVF making her very loyal and easy to manipulate. So swallow it.",

   "Speaking of KGB agents, what the hell is the deal in Russia right now? They are reverting back to their communist roots. That former KGB fella they call their leader, Putin, is consolidating power like no other. And he is killing off opponents just like the old KGB. Kasparov, the great chess master, has a political group that is against reverting back to communism which he vocally expresses. Kasparov has recently gotten correspondence from Putin's party telling him that his views could become \"hazardous to his health.\" Holy XXXX! What the heck is going on. We do NOT need another Russia with thousands of nuclear warheads going back to communism.",

   "Hello there! A friend of mine who lives in Estonia and constitutes himself a fervid anti-fascist sent me a list of Estonian MPs who voted in favor of the notorious and shameful law that enables to remove historic war burials and monuments to soldiers who died fighting fascism. \n \n Privately, I think that it is merely unacceptable. Such laws are offensive, and they humiliate the feelings of people who know very well what fascism is like for they happened to be victims of war and fascists. \n \n People in Europe should know who tries to give rise to fascism in Estonia, that is why I attach the list below. \n \n Besides, I appeal to European politics to break contacts with the people you find in the list. Firstly, T\u00f5nis Lukas who happens to be Estonian member of European Parliament. I appeal to read him out 'cause he voted in favor of this shameful law as well and supports rise of fascism being a member of a reputable organization. \n \n Besides, I suggest forbidding Europe for these people, especially leaders of political parties of Estonia, that elaborated this law.

   "Hi. I live in Lithuania, in city of Pabrad not far from Vilnus. Here is my problem. Maybe you've heard that one of the two migration centers for temporary accommodation of refugees in Lithuania is located in Pabrad. Last Friday there was a serious criminal incident here with the participation of Chechen refugees. Eleven of them broke into an office of a local company, crushed computers and furniture, took away 200,000 Lt and promised to stub the owner of the company if he calls the police. \n \n This incident indicates that the problem of Chechen refugees in Estonia becomes constantly graver. Lithuanian government and the police seem to disregard the problem and prefer to walk-off solving a nonexistent problem of \"non-native Russians\". I guess it's because it may be well employed to reach some political aims. Our pols don't take care about our safety. But they should!\n \n For some reason Lithuanian government blinds to a simple fact that if we don't restrict the inflow of Chechen refugees, it may soon boil over into a major issue and disorders like that in France a year ago. Isn't it time that Lithuanian government put aside all other matters to start doing something to protect people of Lithuania from aggressive aliens belonging to a different culture? I think it is but our government seem to have a different opinion",

   "Estonian president Toomas Hendrik Ilves refused to sign the bill allowing removal of a monument marking the Red Army's victory over Nazi Germany. For your information, the bill had been approved by a two-thirds majority in Estonian parliament and was passed for president's signature the day before. Thank goodness there is at least someone sober-minded in the mainly fascist-like government of Estonia. It is really fascist-like judging by the laws that get adopted in Estonian parliament with the view to justify German Nazism and fascists' atrocities, and reconsider results of the 2nd world war. \n \n Perhaps, president Ilves understands that it is him who will have to stand trial before European Court of justice for all that mess that takes place in Estonia. It is clear that European government won't put up with it will desire explanation. Well, anyway we have to encourage Ilves and make him understand that his attempts to stand fascism uprising and revanchism in his country won't be wasted on. Come on, Ilves! Keep it up!",

   "According to the latest events in Latvia I can understand that the NATO is brassily interfering with country's home affairs, which is surely fraught with serious destabilization of situation there. The NATO (or Washington - if to speak more specifically 'cause NATO is known to be generally directed by the US) is dissatisfied with the work of Latvia's parliament that is determined to push through legal changes increasing governmental control of the security services, which could result in the leaking of alliance secrets to unauthorized persons. Exactly for this purpose the NATO forces Vaira Vike-Freiberga to showdown with parliament and block these legal changes. It all seems very serious 'cause Vike-Freiberga has never done such a thing during her eight years in office. She is even close to dismissing of parliament and requesting early elections, though it involves substantial political risk to Vike-Freiberga herself including a risk of loss of office. Now you see the NATO is responsible for disturbance of the political balance of Latvia? Besides that, the NATO may also be liable for physical disappearance of Vaira Vike-Freiberga that may happen owing to a certain supreme penalty Sentence of national tribunal passed on Viek-Freiberga for treason against the Latvian people.",
