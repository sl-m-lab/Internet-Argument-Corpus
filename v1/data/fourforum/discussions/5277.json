   "Not my son, but someone else's son who was put in grave danger by the outrageous irresponsibility of Newsweek and the other treasonous \"journalists\" who don't give a damn about anything other than their \"scoops\" and manufactured news.\n ========================\n \n My son just called from Afghanistan....\n \n Posted on 05/17/2005 1:51:18 PM CDT \n \n I have posted a few times before; my son is a Marine stationed at a primitive firebase in eastern Afghanistan. They conduct constant missions rooting out insurgents along the Pakistani border; he has been there for about 8 months, due to leave there mid-June for a break, then possibly to Iraq. Today I got a call from him at my work; never had him do that. Satellite phone, big time delay.............\"Just wanted to see how everyone is.......\" he says. Some more pleasantries, and then my son, who has never been too vocal about current events or politics, says that the small town they are near has experienced major rioting, and a military truck in a convoy was blown up (no fatality), the formerly hospitable townsfolk were stoning them as they passed, and the damage to the general climate between them has become very bad. He was quite angry and felt betrayed by Newsweek and other media, and singled out USA Today for inflicting similar harm over time. Just his words, not mine, out of the blue today, at my work. Surprising...\n \n http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1405013/posts",
