   "I'm sure this question has been asked a zillion times already, probably a thousand time within this forum, but. . . .\n \n I'm going to start with a quote from Metaphors We Live By by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, 1980, 2003, pp. 159-160:\n \n \nWe do not believe that there is such a thing as objective (absolute and unconditional) truth, though it has been a long-standing theme in Western culture that there is. We do believe that there are truths but think the idea of truth need not be tied to the objectivist view. We believe that the idea that there is absolute objective truth is not only mistaken but socially and politically dangerous. As we have seen, truth is always relative to a conceptual system that is defined in large part by metaphor. Most of our metaphors have evolved in our culture over a long period, but many are imposed upon us by people in power--political leaders, religious leaders, business leaders, advertisers, the media, etc. . . .\n\n \n I think a very concrete example of having a \"truth\" according to the conceptual system of the Bush Neo-Cons can be seen in the flood of propaganda necessary for the buildup to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. Many of us were saying loudly and vehemently, \"No, Saddam Hussein did not kick out the UN weapons inspectors! Bush did,\" but Bush and his people lied so often and so loudly, slavishly supported by the falsely labeled \"liberal\" media of America that no one listened to us and the bewitched people of America believed that Iraq was responsible for the September 11, 2001 attacks upon the United States (many still do, by the way), that Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden were in extremely close association (they hate each other--if Osama is still alive to hate Saddam Hussein), that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq despite the fact that UN inspector Hans Blix had been unable to find any and (Bush kicked him out of Iraq before he could finish his inspection, by the way) believed that there weren't any to be found. Blix was right. Bush was wrong but a sizeable number of foolish people in the United States still believe Bush.",

   "It seems to me that your post has nothing to do with engaging in philosophical debate over the nature of truth and everything to do with advancing your political views. You have not made any substantial argument for a relativist position on truth, as the quote would seem to imply. Quite the contrary, your paragraph was a politically-motivated argument that the Bush administration's portrayal of pre-invasion Iraq was not factual. Let us suppose that everything you said in that paragraph agreed with the facts. If that is the case, then the argument drawn through it is that the Bush administration commited an objective falsehood--portrayed things in contrast to how they really are. You say yourself\n \n \nBush was wrong but a sizeable number of foolish people in the United States still believe Bush\n\n \n This has nothing to do with relativist/metaphorical understandings of truth, it is an evaluation based entirely in an objective understanding of truth, where one can make such judgments, that he was wrong in a real and objective sense, and that those who believed his falsehoods were foolish. Nothing has been said outside of the objective framework in your paragraph.\n \n Now, a couple more things so that discussion of this doesn't die here, because whether or not the topic has been done it's still one worth following.\n \n If, despite your impassioned diatribe supporting objective truth, you still wish to explore Lakoff and Johnson's views, bring out some coherent articulation of what a non-objective understanding of truth looks like. Then justify the claim that an objectivist view of truth is dangerous; just flesh it out so there's something to be considered, it's too ambiguous as it stands.\n \n Also, I wish to suggest to you that morality and truth are something of a package deal. There can only be objective morals if there is an objective reality to truth--if that is not self-evident, let me know why not. Your socio-political views rest strongly on a framework of objective morality, for you can only make a case for the equality of women if there is some reason, outside of your personal preference, why that should be so. I believe there is such reason, but I don't think that can be justified apart from objective morality, and I've said as much to you before (with no reply on your part). Yet I suspect that you struggle, because you are no doubt suspicious that an objective moral law will require you to live a certain way...the same law that makes all people equal might require of you certain standards about how you treat others, about the sanctity of life, about what is right and wrong in terms of human sexuality, and you don't want to submit to any such standards. It is always difficult when you try to have your cake and eat it too. Responsibility may come with equality, and it will continue to be quite a struggle to justify why you embrace the latter and reject the former, if they are so intertwined.",

If we wanted to know the absolute, \"objective\" truth about what is presently happening in Iraq it truly would be necessary to sort through all the numerous facts of a thousand or more years or history--and many of the pieces are missing.\n\n \n This question belongs in the politics or peace in the middle east sections. It is a matter of scholarly debate over historical background, anthropological study, and the facts of the recent war. There is nothing philosophical being considered...yet you use quotations around the words \"objective\" and \"truth\". I think that you are confusing an epistemological concern over discerning the truth in this situation as if it consisted of an ontological argument about the nature of truth. All along, you are assuming there is objective truth to the situation, only demonstrating that you feel it is hard to discern...while still being quite confident that you have it :) \n \n \nSo, what is truth?\n\n Now you ask a philosophical question...maybe. But I think the question will become circular as we attempt to answer it. After all, when we speak of the truth about the Iraq situation, we want to know the reality of it, that which the facts confirm about what happened and why. Contrary things aren't other understandings of truth, they are falsehoods. So when you ask, \"what is truth?\", do you want to know the reality of it, what truth really is? If that's what your asking, I'm afraid you already have your conclusion in the back of your mind. In fact, I'm not sure you can escape this objective understanding of truth, that the truth of something is the way it really is in itself, outside all subjective understandings of it. Supposing you were to posit that truth is subjective, dependent on personal perspective and bias...wouldn't you be believing that the real, objective truth about truth is that it is subjective? Is it not clear that the law of non-contradiction, which saves us from roundsquares and other nonsensical monstrosities, forbids any non-objective understanding of truth? If that is the case, the question \"what is truth?\" is really no question at all. Any discourse attempted through a non-objective truth view will either break down to incoherent babbling or prove to be objective (and thereby hypocritical) on some fundamental level.\n \n It is possible that rather than asking, \"what is truth?\" you meant to ask the far more practical question, \"what is the truth?\" But naturally this is far to big a question to be answered in a single thread, and needs to be broken down to debating the truth in various fields...the truth about the war in Iraq in the politics section, the truth about morality in the philosophy section, etc.\n \n \"What is truth?\" is a question that is answered in the asking. \"What is the truth?\" is a question for all humans to collaboratively continue discovering, as giving a full answer would require possession of all knowledge.",

How astonishing that something perfectly fits the Thailand metaphor in the reality of everyone educated enough to understand it; so the sun, Bush, dog metaphors and a tremendous number of others. Why should this be? We could posit any number of reasons, but of course we'd just be theorizing with no real reason to believe any one of them over another. Have we reached the point yet where the presence of one, objective, subjectively percieved reality is simply more believable? If not, now we have to account for differences in these realities, because that is the reason we first began to theorize about them in the first place...we never would have concocted--er, considered--this whole train of thought except that we needed to allow for the truth of contradictory realities. How can we tell which realities are different and which are the same? Well, the different ones are the ones we disagree on, such as matters of morality. Hasn't it yet become far more likely that we are constructing these so similar yet conveniently disparate realities than that they actually exist? Which seems more likely, that this theory is being brought up because it makes more sense of the world, or that it is an escape route from the responsibilities of objective reality?\n \n Let me ask this: Supposing I fully supported this idea of everyone percieving different realities, and I told you that in my reality it was all right for me to torture children?

I hope that you would say, \"that's ridiculous!\" \"It may be that there is technically a very very very slim possibility that it is true...but it is far more likely that you have bought into this preposterous and thoroughly despicable idea because it served motivations you could not possibly justify in reality.\" I should like to think that you would say something like that.\n Such, I think, is an exagerrated form of a reasonable response to the suggestion that reality is not constant, it just happens to correspond in all the areas we have universal agreement on--a truly amazing phenomenon when you consider the limitless possibilities of other realities.

That seems like a good working definition to me. If we assume that \"the earth goes around the sun\" is objectively true, then it was objectively true even when no one believed it, or even before there were people around to believe anything. Note that nothing in that definition is meant to imply that we can definately learn the objective truth. As you point out, our faulty perceptions, emotions, and sometimes irrational thoughts can cause us to believe that something is true when, actually and objectively, it isn't. That's why I was suggesting comparing potentialy true statements and checking for contradictions. Any system which relies solely on human perception to determine truth is flawed; we must add something else, something objective, to the system if we want it to be at all reliable.",

Don't just listen to other people. Try leaning on what He says and see what happens. Lastly, work on becoming a person who is trustworthy. This has two rather unsuspecting effects. First, you are able to control what you do. You are able to work on becoming trustworthy. You will find success in this arena if this is what you do. Give yourself the grace to blow it as well. Second, you will find that as you become more trustworthy, that it will be much easier to discern who is and is not trustworthy in spite of their flaws.\n \n Lastly, if God is trustworthy (and I believe he absolutely is) then He is absolutely trusworthy and He will never let you down, even when it feels like He has, that is only a feeling.
