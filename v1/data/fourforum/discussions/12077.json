It seems now the Dems are reacting calling for leaders to put on a special election to replace the Senate seat Obama has vacated.\n \n Democrats urge special election to succeed Obama - Yahoo! News\n \n What's funny is anyone associated with Blagojevich won't win the seat! That means Republicans have a big chance here that is of course if they do not screw it up. Democrats are going to have to put someone who is far far far away from Blago if they want to win this one (that is if the race is approved, which it probably will be).",

   "From what I've heard (the World Service was talking about this earlier) Obama was only about as friendly with the governor as was necessary to do his job as senator - i.e. they knew each other and worked together but were not friends or allies.\n\n \n Really? \n On the Chicago TV show \"Public Affairs with Jeff Berkowitz\" on June 27, 2002, state Sen. Obama said, \"Right now, my main focus is to make sure that we elect Rod Blagojevich as Governor, we...\"\n \n \"You working hard for Rod?\" interrupted Berkowitz.\n \n \"You betcha,\" said Obama.\n \n \"Hot Rod?\" asked the host.\n \n \"That's exactly right,\" Obama said.\n \n In 2004, then-Gov. Blagojevich enthusiastically endorsed Obama for the Senate seat after he won the nomination, and Obama endorsed Blagojevich for his 2006 re-election race in early 2005.\n \n In the Summer of 2006, then-U.S. Sen. Obama backed Blagojevich even though there were serious questions at the time about Blago's hiring practices.\n \n The period in question is the period between Blagojevich's election in 2002 and his re-election bid in 2006. There are only a limited number of likely possibilities. That Rod Blagojevich didn't begin his corrupt activities until after 2006 stretches credulity. Perhaps Barack Obama genuinely did not know what Rod Blagojevich was about. That would demonstrate a stunning na\u00efvet\u00e9 or willful ignorance, neither admission reflecting particularly well on the President-Elect. Childlike innocence is a wonderful thing but not in the President of the United States.\n \n It may be that an ambitious young Barack Obama was willing to overlook his fellow partisan's corruption under the principle \"he's a sonuvabitch but he's our sonuvabitch\", not a particularly attractive viewpoint, especially for a post-partisan candidate running on a reform ticket.\n \n Or it may be that he didn't care-just business as usual in Illinois politics. So much for the reform candidate.What Didn't He Know and When Didn't He Know It?",
