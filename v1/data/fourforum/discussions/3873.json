   "The Birth of Jesus By Jon Meacham - Newsweek Magazine - (December 13, 2004 issue) - Click Here\n \n Well, it's that time of year again, when the skeptics come out to question the Gospel, Mary and the Virgin Birth. Here is a direct quote from the Newsweek article, as they play to the skeptics and Biblical nihilists:\n \"... as with so many other elements of faith, the Nativity narratives are the subject of ongoing scholarly debate over their historical accuracy, their theological meaning and whether some of the central images and words of the Christian religion owe as much to the pagan culture of the Roman Empire as they do to apostolic revelation. \n \n The clash between literalism and a more historical view of faith is also playing out in theaters and bookstores.\n A NEWSWEEK Poll found that 84 percent of American adults consider themselves Christians, and 82 percent see Jesus as God or the son of God. Seventy-nine percent say they believe in the virgin birth, and 67 percent think the Christmas story&#8212;from the angels' appearance to the Star of Bethlehem&#8212;is historically accurate.\n \n I consider the Newsweek article hostile to my faith, and yet, history records that these unfounded claims and Anti-Christ attacks are nothing new for the Bible and the Christian faith.\n \n Jewish Babylonian Talmud charges that Christ (Who is called Ben Pandera) was born out of wedlock after His mother had been seduced by a Roman soldier named Pandera or Panthera. Respected scholar Bruce Metzger has commented upon this appellation: \n \n &#8220;The defamatory account of his birth seems to reflect a knowledge of the Christian tradition that Jesus was the son of the virgin Mary, the Greek word for virgin, parthenos, being distorted into the name Pandera&#8221;.\n The article mentions, Celsus, a pagan philosopher of the second century A.D., who produced the oldest extant literary attack against Christianity. His True Discourse (c. A.D. 178) was a bitter assault upon Christ. Celsus argued that Jesus was born in low circumstances, being the illegitimate son of a soldier named Panthera. (Note the recycled lie and the original source)\n \n So far from a \"new\" debate, this kind scurrilous mud slinging is very old! The Newsweek article runs through canard after false charge. It is alleged, that the Christian birth \"myth\" runs parallel to the story surrounding Caesar Augustus, whose mother was believed to be impregnated by the sun god, Apollo. \n \n That is like saying, &#8220;Elephants have ears; I have ears; therefore, I am an elephant.&#8221;\n \n O.K. Skeptics and Biblical Nihilists, you have everything you could ever want in this article, Herod the Great slaughtering of the Innocents? Mary and Joseph as residents of Bethlehem who were later forced to move north to Nazareth? You have: The Great Census Debate, Luke (2:1-3):\n \"In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world. (This was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria.) And everyone went to his own town to register.\"\n You have the (Anti) \"Jesus Seminar\", who want to &#8220;de-mythologize,&#8221; and thus &#8220;sanitize,&#8221; the sacred New Testament documents. You have Ms. Elaine Pagels and her Gnostic Gospel of Philip reducing Jesus to a spiritual Son of God. So enjoy this thread and more questions to ponder: Isaiah 7:14 - Did Isaiah Prophesy the Virgin Birth of Christ?",

   "You are against scholarship then? Or more broadly, all knowledge?\n\n \n Actually, that is one of my points I would like to make, Jon Meacham gives equal credence to any and all theories from secondary sources, and many have clear motives like the Roman soldier story.\n \n IMO, this is the media hosting and sponsoring Anti-Christian speculation and empty conjecture.\n \n As an example, Jon Meacham could have covered the authors Luke and Matthew.\n \n Luke&#8217;s credibility as an historian has been defended by such scholars as Sir William Ramsay, who began his academic career as a skeptic, but was turned around by the hard facts of evidence. The ancient historian had investigated carefully the background of Jesus (Lk. 1:3), and he argued vigorously for the fact of the Lord&#8217;s virgin birth. As a doctor (Col. 4:14), he would have resisted the notion of such an event had there not been compelling evidence for it.\n 'Luke is a historian of the first rank; not merely are his statement of fact trustworthy; he is possessed of the true historic sense; he fixes his mind on the idea and plan that rules in the evolution of history, and proportions the scale of his treatment to the importance of each incident.

I quoted the historian, Sir William Ramsay who traveled extensively through Greece, Turkey and Palestine (before the modern State of Israel) investigating every city, town and Temple ruin mentioned in Acts, and GoL.\n \n Quote: (from my F.F. Bruce link)\n \n Sir William Ramsay, who devoted many fruitful years to the archaeology of Asia Minor, testifies to Luke's intimate and accurate acquaintance with Asia Minor and the Greek East at the time with which his writings deal. When Ramsay first set out on his archeological work, in the late 'seventies of last century, he was firmly convinced of the truth of the then fashionable Tubingen theory, that Acts was a late production of the middle of the second century AD, and he was only gradually compelled to a complete reversal of his views by the inescapable evidence of the facts uncovered in the course of his research. \n \n Although in his later years Ramsay was persuaded to don the mantle of a popular apologist for the trustworthiness of the New Testament records, the judgments which he publicized in this way were judgments which he had previously formed as a scientific archaeologist and student of ancient classical history and literature. He was not talking unadvisedly or playing to the religious gallery when he expressed the view that 'Luke's history is unsurpassed in respect of its trustworthiness\"; this was the sober conclusion to which his researches led him, in spite of the fact that he started with a very different opinion of Luke's historical credit. His mature verdict was pronounced in the following terms: \n \n 'Luke is a historian of the first rank; not merely are his statement of fact trustworthy; he is possessed of the true historic sense; he fixes his mind on the idea and plan that rules in the evolution of history, and proportions the scale of his treatment to the importance of each incident. He seizes the important and critical events and shows their true nature at greater length, while he touches lightly or omits entirely much that was valueless for his purpose. In short, this author should be placed along with the very greatest of historians.\" \n \n It is not every scholar who would endorse Ramsay's judgment on Luke's technical expertise as a historian; but his detailed accuracy is something which can be checked time and again. Research in the field which forms the historical and geographical background to Luke's narrative has not stood still since Ramsay's heyday, but our respect for Luke's reliability continues to grow as our knowledge of this field increases.",

   "Not only do we not know who wrote one word in Luke-Acts, we know nothing about who Luke was. \n\n \n Actually, we have internal evidence from Paul's letters. Luke was a Doctor, see Colossians.\n \n The Gospel of Luke\n \n Luke is the solitary Gentile writer of the Bible, yet his dual books of the Gospel of Luke and the Book of Acts constitute about one-fourth of the New Testament. \n \n By training he was a physician (Col. 4:14). He joined Paul on the apostle&#8217;s second missionary campaign (Acts 16:10), and was with him periodically during the tireless preacher&#8217;s ministry (note the &#8220;we&#8221; sections in Acts). \n \n As with the Gospel of Mark, it is clear that Luke is writing for non-Hebrew recipients. He explains, for example, that Capernaum is &#8220;a city of Galilee&#8221; (4:31), that the country of the Gerasenes is &#8220;over against Galilee&#8221; (8:26), and that the town of Emmaus is seven miles from Jerusalem (24:13) &#8211; circumstances quite familiar already to Palestineans. \n \n Though the book is addressed to &#8220;most excellent Theophilus,&#8221; with the purpose of confirming the faith of this Gentile in the matters wherein he had been taught (1:3,4), it is apparent that the intended audience was much wider. This is a treatise designed to reach the Greeks with the message of Jesus Christ. \n \n The Greeks were preoccupied with a consideration of &#8220;man.&#8221; It is not without purpose, therefore, that Luke focuses upon Christ as the perfect example of humanity.\n \n Luke&#8217;s goal in underscoring the human aspects of the Lord is revealed by the following factors: \n \n * He gives the most complete record of the Savior&#8217;s birth and childhood (chapters 1 and 2). \n \n * The inspired historian traces Christ&#8217;s lineage all the way back to Adam, demonstrating Jesus&#8217; solidarity with mankind. \n \n * He emphasizes many human traits of the Master, e.g., His weeping over Jerusalem (19:41), and His sweating great drops of blood (22:44). \n \n * Luke gives prominence to the prayers of Christ (a factor not unexpected in a consideration of the Lord&#8217;s humanity). Of the fifteen prayers of Jesus that are recorded in the four Gospel accounts, eleven are found in Luke&#8217;s narrative. \n \n Luke provides first-rate testimony for the genuineness of Jesus&#8217; miracles. A scientist by profession, he had thoroughly investigated the claims of Christ&#8217;s supernatural works (he mentions twenty of them, six of which are unique to him), and he treats them as historical reality. \n \n Moreover, the evidence for the Lord&#8217;s virgin birth must have been overwhelming for a doctor to acknowledge it and argue the case as strongly as Luke did (1:26-38). \n \n Luke&#8217;s message is truly international in its thrust. He mentions that the angel who heralded Jesus&#8217; birth brought &#8220;good tidings . . . to all the people&#8221; (2:10). He records the words of Simeon who declared that the Messiah would be &#8220;a light for revelation to the Gentiles&#8221; (2:32). He alone mentions God&#8217;s interest in Gentiles during the Old Testament era &#8211; the cases of the widow of Zarephath and Naaman (4:25-27). His account of Christ&#8217;s parable of the good Samaritan reveals that spiritual concern is to flow beyond the pale of Judaism (10:25-37). \n \n Examining the Four Gospels - Click Here",

   "The Great Census Debate\n \n Luke (2:1-3) identifies the following as an historical event occurring at the time of the birth of Jesus:\n \"In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world. (This was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria.) And everyone went to his own town to register.\" (NIV)\n Many skeptics have doubted the veracity of this statement, given that the only census known by a Quirinius until recently was one dated by Josephus as A.D. 6. (Jesus couldn't have been born later than 4 B.C., because that was the year that Herod the Great died). So, Luke must have been wrong, either about the census, or about Jesus being born when Herod the Great was still alive, right? Wrong!\n \n \"Jerry Vardaman has discovered the name of Quirinius on a coin in micrographic letters, placing him as proconsul of Syria and Cilicia from 11 B.C. until the death of Herod.\" (McRay, p. 154)\n \n Further evidence indicates that it is very possible that a census could have been ongoing in Israel at the time of Jesus' birth - it was just a different census (and probably a different Quirinius) than mentioned by the Josephus.\n \n Note also that Luke was aware of the later (6 A.D.) census, which he refers to in Acts 5:37 as \"the\" census, as opposed to \"a\" census in Luke 2:1-3).\n \n Please note, that on yet again, another point, Jon Meacham only entertains the skeptics POV in his article.\n \n Tsk, Tsk!",

   "Dr. Simon Greenleaf examined Luke's Gospel and noted:\n \n Luke, according to Eusebius, was a native of Antioch, by profession a physician, and for a considerable period a companion of the apostle Paul. From the casual notices of him in the Scriptures, and from the early Christian writers, it has been collected, that his parents were Gentiles, but that he in his youth embraced Judaism, from which he was converted to Christianity. The first mention of him is that he was with Paul at Troas, whence he appears to have attended him to Jerusalem; continued with him in all his troubles in Judea; and sailed with him when he was sent a prisoner from Ceasarea to Rome, where he remained with him during his two years confinement. As none of the ancient fathers have mentioned his having suffered martyrdom, it is gernerally supposed that he died a natural death.\n \n That he wrote his Gospel for the benefit of the Gentile converts is affirmed by the unanimous voice of Christian anitiquity; and it may also be inferred from its dedication to a Gentile. He is particularly careful to specify various circumstances conducive to the information of strangers, but not so to the Jews; he gives the lineage of Jesus upwards, after the manner of the Gentiles, instead of downwards, as Matthew had done; tracing it up to Adam, and thus showing that Jesus was the promised seed of the woman; and he marks the eras of his birth, and of the ministry of John, by the reigns of the Roman emperors. He also has introduced several things, not mentioned by the other evangelists, but highly encouraging to the gentiles to turn to God in the hope of pardon and acceptance; of which description are the parables of the publican and pharisee, in the temple; the lost piece of silver; and the prodigal son; and the fact of Christ's visit to Zaccheus the publican, and the pardon of the penitent thief.\n \n That Luke was a physician, appears not only from the testimony of Paul, but from the internal marks in his Gospel, showing that he was both an acute observer, and had given particular and even professional attention to all our Saviour's miracles of healing. Thus, the man whom Matthew and Mark describe simply as a leper, Luke describes as full of leprosy; he, whom they mention as had having a withered hand, Luke says had his right hand withered; and of the maid, of whom the others say that Jesus took her spirit came to her again. He alone, with professional accuracy of observation, says that virtue went out of Jesus, and healed the sick; he alone states the fact that the sleep of the disciples in Gethsemane was induced by extreme sorrow; and mentions the blood- like sweat of Jesus, as occasioned by the intensity of his agony; and he alone relates the miraculous healing of Malchus's ear. That he was also a man of a liberal education, the comparative elegance of his writings sufficiently shows.\n \n The design of Luke's Gospel was to supersede the defective and inaccurate narratives then in circulation, and to deliver to Theophilus, to whom it is addressed, a full and authentic account of the life, doctrines, miracles, death and resurrection of our Saviour. Who Theophilus was, the learned are not perfectly agreed; but the most probable opinion is that of Dr. Lardner, now generally adopted, that, as Luke wrote his Gospel in Greece, Theophilus was a man of rank in that country. Either the relations subsisting between him and Luke, or the dignity and power of his rank, or both, induced the evangelist, who himself also \"had perfect understanding of all things from the first,\" to devote the utmost care to the drawing up of a complete and authentic narrative of these great events. He does not affirm himself to have been an eye-witness; though his personal knowledge of some of the transactions may well be inferred from the \"perfect understanding\" which he says he possessed. Some of the learned seem to have drawn this inference as to them all, and to have placed him in the class of original witnesses; but this opinion, though maintained on strong and plausible grounds, is not generally adopted. If, then, he did not write from his own personal knowledge, the question is, what is the legal character of his testimony?\n \n If it were \"the result of inquiries, made under competent public authority, concerning matters in which the public are concerned,\" it would possess every legal attribute of an inquisition, and, as such, would be legally admissible in evidence, in a court of justice. To entitle such results, however, to our full confidence, it is not necessary that they should be obtained under a legal commission; it is sufficient if the inquiry is gravely undertaken and pursued, by a person of competent intelligence, sagacity and integrity. The request of a person in authority, or a desire to serve the public, are, to all moral intents, as sufficient a motive as a legal commission. Thus, we know that when complaint is made to the head of a department, of official misconduct or abuse, existing in some remote quarter, nothing is more common than to send some confidential person to the spot, to ascertain the facts and report them to the department; and this report is confidently adopted as the basis of its discretionary action, in the correction of that abuse, or the removal of the offender. Indeed, the result of any grave inquiry is equally certain to receive our confidence, though it may have been voluntarily undertaken, if the party making it had access to the means of complete and satisfactory information upon the subject. If, therefore, Luke's Gospel were to be regarded only as the work of a contemporary historian, it would be entitled to our confidence. But it is more than this. It is the result of careful science, intelligence and education, concerning subjects which he was perfectly competent to peculiarly skilled, they being cases of the cure of maladies; subjects, too, of which he already had the perfect knowledge of a contemporary, and perhaps an eye-witness, but beyond doubt, familiar with the parties concerned in the transactions, and belonging to the community in which the events transpired, which were in the mouths of all; and the narrative, moreover, drawn up for the especial use, and probably at the request, of a man of distinction, whom it would not be for the interest nor safety of the writer to deceive or mislead. Such a document certainly possesses all the moral attributes of an inquest of office, or of any other official investigation of facts; and as such is entitled, in foro conscientiae, to be adduced of the matters it contains.",

   "\n \n You and all other skeptics creepin' and peepin' in on this thread have the burden of Proof if you have it in your mean spirited hearts to impune the Holy Scripture according to Luke.\n \n :lol:\n \n\n \n Hi Richbee,\n \n Besides whom the burden of proof lies with being patently false, this is an example of what Christian love and charity will do to a person after enough time, IMO.\n \n You have made a claim that Luke wrote the gospel named for him. It is clearly incumbent upon you to back your claim, according to all conventions of debate, including this forum. I suppose it would be nice if you could continue to cut and paste fantastical statements made by persons of questionable repute, then sit back and watch the mean-spirited heathens do the heavy lifting, but it cannot be allowed to happen. \n \n I want you to prove that Luke wrote the gospel of Luke, as you claim, or retract the statement.\n \n \n\n Dr. Simon Greenleaf, one of the principle founders of the Harvard Law School, and an expert in the rules of evidence writes:\n Every document, apparently ancient, coming from the proper repository or custody, and bearing on its face no evident marks of forger, the law presumes to be genuine, and devolves on the opposing party the burden of proving it to be otherwise. \n\n \n The problem, of course, is that the Gospel of Luke meets neither of those two criteria. The burden of proof lies squarely with you.\n \n \n\n Dr. Simon Greenleaf examined Luke's Gospel and noted:\n Luke, according to Eusebius, was a native of Antioch, by profession a physician, and for a considerable period a companion of the apostle Paul. \n\n \n Eusebius is a terribly flawed character and his works must be viewed suspiciously. How would he know the above statement to be true any more than we would? He wrote 250 years after the \"fact\".\n \n He claimed, in his Ecclesiastical History, that Abgar wrote a letter to Jesus and received a reply from Jesus to that letter.\n \n In the 32nd Chapter of his 12th Book of Evangelical Preparation, Eusebius wrote: \"How it may be Lawful and Fitting to use Falsehood as a Medicine, and for the Benefit of those who Want to be Deceived.\"\n \n Eusebius advocated for fabrication of history itself. In Ecclesiastical History, Vol. 8, chapter 2, he wrote: 'We shall introduce into this history in general only those events which may be useful first to ourselves and afterwards to posterity.' He also wrote \"I have repeated whatever may redound to the glory, and suppressed all that could tend to the disgrace of our religion.\"\n \n I say throw it out as useless material from a prejudiced, unreliable source. Do you trust others who admit they purposely lie to promote an agenda? Further, how does this lend itself to Luke being the author of Luke? \n \n regards",

   "\"The Gospels are written within one generation of Jesus and while witnesses were still living.\"\n \n This isn't a contradiction, however neither are therfore nessearily completely true - you trying to tell me that no bias could have creeped into the gospel leading to the exageration of tales wihtin?\n\n \n The story is very basic, and the facts were recorded from the get go. All who attended Pentecost - Acts 2, knew the basics, as the Church grew from a about 100 to 3,000 in one week. By Acts 7, the Chuch may have been 20,000 - 30,000 and that led to the explusion in Acts 9.\n \n Now, the basic facts? And, oh Paul testifies to Luke and visa versa, and this is just normal history and how we accept many facts handed down from ancient authors.\n \n \n  Carefully consider the internal Biblical evidence and testimony:\n \n \n \n Creeds and Hymns\n \n Paul&#8217;s letters contain a number of creeds and hymns (Rom. 1:3-4;1 Cor. 11:23 ff.;15:3-8; Phil. 2:6_11; Col.1:15-18;1 Tim. 3:16; 2 Tim. 2:8; see also John 1:1-18; 1 Peter 3:18-22; 1 John 4:2). Three things can be said about them. First, they are pre-Pauline and very early. They use language which is not characteristically Pauline, they often translate easily back into Aramaic, and they show features of Hebrew poetry and thought-forms. This means that they came into existence while the church was heavily Jewish and that they became standard, recognized creeds and hymns well before their incorporation into Paul's letters. Most scholars date them from 33 to 48 A.D. Some, like Hengel, date many of them in the first decade after Jesus&#8217; death.\n \n Second, the content of these creeds and hymns centers on the death, resurrection, and deity of Christ. They consistently present a portrait of a miraculous and divine Jesus who rose from the dead. Third, they served as hymns of worship in the liturgy of the early assemblies and as didactic expressions for teaching the Christology of the church.\n \n In sum, the idea of a fully divine, miracle-working Jesus who rose from the dead was present during the first decade of Christianity. Such a view was not a legend which arose several decades after the crucifixion.\n \n Galatians 1 and 2\n \n All scholars agree that Galatians was written by Paul. Paul tells us that he received his understanding of who Jesus was and what he did from a supernatural experience within a year or two after the crucifixion. He also points out that he went to Jerusalem three years later and the apostles there agreed that his message of a divine Son of God who was crucified and rose from the dead was correct. There is no reason to doubt that Paul visited the apostles, since he has no motive for lying and, further, such a visit fits well with the Jewish practice of looking to authorized teachers of a Rabbi's doctrines for controls on doctrinal purity. Thus, belief in a divine, risen Jesus was in existence within just a few years after his death.\n \n Excerpt from Scaling the Secular City - By J.P. Moreland - Chapter 5: The Historicity of the New Testament",

It is clearly incumbent upon you to back your claim, \n\n \n False, get busy, look at my last post and the skeptics have the burden to prove forgery or error.\n \n If Luke didn't write Luke, someone else with teh name wrote LUKE!\n \n As I indicated in my last post, we have internal evidence, testified to by Paul, where in the Jewish culture of truth telling, liars were stoned to death.\n \n Luke is no small figure here, but makes the boldest trip in all of history, so in all of Paul's travels of 12,000 miles, the trip to Rome was dangerous and HUGE!\n \n It is not just any Rabbi, who is a Roman citizen and can demand an audience with Ceasar!\n \n So get busy! Additionally, Nero is no ordinary boring Emperor, and we have historical evidence of the fires of Rome, and the story from Tacitus of of this time period of the Christus or Christos in Rome.\n \n You want to dispute these basic facts? Vanity, all is vanity my friend, because we can't change the history, and the history of the Christian marytrs and Early Church Fathers is sacred and very caefully perserved.\n \n Now, not that there isn't mysteries or paradoxes: How does Luke escape Rome? Note, many had escaped to Greece, so where does Luke escape to to finish his gospel and the book of Acts? I have his gospel dated around 50 - 55 A.D. - clearly before Acts, and Paul's trial in Rome may have been 62 A.D., and I have Acts ending before Paul is dead, and clearly before Nero is dead, and clearly before the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem in 70 A.D.\n \n In any case, Luke is the most amazing Historian in all of Greek or Roman history.

   "The Sun Darkened at Noon \n \n \"'In that day,' declares the Sovereign Lord, 'I will make the sun go down at noon and darken the earth in broad daylight....I will make that time like mourning for an only son, and the end of it like a bitter day.'\" (Amos 8:9-10)\n \n It probably wasn't until the day of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ in 32 A.D. that this prophecy from the Old Testament Book of Amos took on clarity and meaning, for in Matthew 27:45 Jesus had just been nailed to the cross when the Bible records:\n \n \"From the sixth hour until the ninth hour darkness came over all the land.\"\n \n Just as the \"Star of Bethlehem\" marked the birth of Christ, so now God brought forth another celestial miracle to pronounce His death. This prophecy is one of those that is beyond the control of mortal man. But is there any evidence that this really occurred? Did the sun go dark at noonday? In his book, Evidence That Demands a Verdict (Volume 1, pages 81-87), Josh McDowell provides the following historical evidence that what took place at Calvary was more that just fanciful mythology:\n \n Concerning the Samaritan-born historian Thallus, circa 52 A.D: (The writings of Thallus no longer exist, yet were alluded to by the historian Julius Africanus, as follows): \"Thallus, in the third book of his histories, explains away this darkness as an eclipse of the sun - unreasonably, as it seems to me - unreasonably, of course, because a solar eclipse could not take place at the time of a full moon, and it was at the season of the Paschal full moon that Christ died.\"\n \n Likewise, Africanus wrote concerning the writings of another first century historian by the name of Phlegon: \"....during the time of Tiberius Caesar an eclipse of the sun occurred during the full moon.\" \n \n Phlegon is also mentioned by the historian Origen in his work, \"Contra Celsum,\" book 2, sections 14, 39, and 59: \"Phlegon mentioned the eclipse that took place during the crucifixion of the Lord Christ....and this is shown by the historical account itself of Tiberius Caesar.\" Apparently at one time there were historical accounts of the strange darkness that came over the land that were kept in the official archives of Tiberius Caesar, though they are likely lost to history.\n \n Finally, the 2nd century Roman born jurist and theologian Tertullian referred to a Roman archives report of an \"unexplained darkness that took place during the reign of Tiberius Caesar, as can be seen in the archives of Pontius Pilate.\"\n \n The darkness spoken of in the book of Matthew occurred between noon and three P.M. in the afternoon (from the sixth to the ninth hours, as the Jews were noted as referring to the sixth and the ninth hours of daylight). Note that a solar eclipse will take less than an hour to complete, and a total solar eclipse lasts just a few minutes. This, coupled with the fact that a solar eclipse cannot occur during a full moon (the moon would be on the 'other' side of the earth), provides further evidence that what occurred was something other than an eclipse of the sun. Just what it was no one can say for sure, just that from recorded historical sources there was a strange darkness during the time of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. From God's perspective, it surely was a time of mourning for His only begotten son. \n \n Jesus once said, \"I am the light of the world.\" So it shouldn't be surprising that during his death there might be a time of darkness over the land.",

   "The gospel of Luke is believed to have been written circa 90 CE, sixty years after the events of Jesus' ministry and ten years after Matthew's gospel. In the preface to this work, the author explains that his gospel is based, to some degree, upon the writings of earlier authors. There exist problems with Luke's account. For example, he provides a genealogy of Jesus which differs considerably from the genealogy of Jesus given to us by Matthew. In order to get Jesus to be born in Bethlehem (so as to fulfill prophecy), Luke creates an extremely improbable Roman census decree the nature of which can only be considered as an example of Luke's literary license. The author of Luke is not considered to have been an eyewitness to Jesus' ministry. \n \n On another note, it's interesting to watch the evolution of Christology within the NT. For example, Paul, the earliest of the NT authors, finds nothing extraordinary concerning the events surrounding Jesus' birth, but instead, seems to believe that Jesus became divine at the time of his material or spiritual resurrection. Mark, the next in line, pins Jesus' divinity to his baptism. Matthew and Luke trace Jesus' divinity to his birth, while the later gospel of John tells us that Jesus was divine for all eternity.",

   "Question:\n \n Jon, in your article you cite, Celsus, a pagan philosopher of the second century A.D., who produced the oldest extant literary attack against Christianity. His True Discourse (c. A.D. 178) was a bitter assault upon Christ. Celsus argued that Jesus was born in low circumstances, being the illegitimate son of a soldier named Panthera. \n \n Are you aware of his source? The Jewish Talmud? The Jewish Babylonian Talmud charges that Christ (Who is called Ben Pandera) was born out of wedlock after His mother had been seduced by a Roman soldier named Pandera or Panthera. Respected scholar Bruce Metzger has commented upon this appellation: \n \n &#8220;The defamatory account of his birth seems to reflect a knowledge of the Christian tradition that Jesus was the son of the virgin Mary, the Greek word for virgin, parthenos, being distorted into the name Pandera&#8221;.\n \n So far from a \"new\" debate, this kind scurrilous mud slinging is very old!",

Sigh, more arguments from silence!\n \n Creeds and Hymns\n \n Paul&#8217;s letters contain a number of creeds and hymns (Rom. 1:3-4;1 Cor. 11:23 ff.;15:3-8; Phil. 2:6_11; Col.1:15-18;1 Tim. 3:16; 2 Tim. 2:8; see also John 1:1-18; 1 Peter 3:18-22; 1 John 4:2). Three things can be said about them. First, they are pre-Pauline and very early. They use language which is not characteristically Pauline, they often translate easily back into Aramaic, and they show features of Hebrew poetry and thought-forms. This means that they came into existence while the church was heavily Jewish and that they became standard, recognized creeds and hymns well before their incorporation into Paul's letters. Most scholars date them from 33 to 48 A.D. Some, like Hengel, date many of them in the first decade after Jesus&#8217; death.\n \n Second, the content of these creeds and hymns centers on the death, resurrection, and deity of Christ. They consistently present a portrait of a miraculous and divine Jesus who rose from the dead. Third, they served as hymns of worship in the liturgy of the early assemblies and as didactic expressions for teaching the Christology of the church.\n \n In sum, the idea of a fully divine, miracle-working Jesus who rose from the dead was present during the first decade of Christianity. Such a view was not a legend which arose several decades after the crucifixion.\n \n Galatians 1 and 2\n \n All scholars agree that Galatians was written by Paul. Paul tells us that he received his understanding of who Jesus was and what he did from a supernatural experience within a year or two after the crucifixion. He also points out that he went to Jerusalem three years later and the apostles there agreed that his message of a divine Son of God who was crucified and rose from the dead was correct. There is no reason to doubt that Paul visited the apostles, since he has no dear motive for lying and, further, such a visit fits well with the Jewish practice of looking to authorized teachers of a rabbi's doctrines for controls on doctrinal purity. Thus, belief in a divine, risen Jesus was in existence within just a few years after his death.\n \n Excerpt from Scaling the Secular City - By J.P.

   "Luke creates an extremely improbable Roman census decree the nature of which can only be considered as an example of Luke's literary license. \n\n \n Look again!\n \n \n Here is what the Gospel of Luke actually says:\n Luke 2:1 In those days a decree went out from Emperor Augustus that all the world should be registered. (NRSV).\n The notion that a census would occur simultaneously throughout the entire Empire at one point is an anachronism. That&#8217;s the way we do it in the United States, in a highly centralized process administered by the federal (central) government during a discreet time period. Such a feat was not possible in ancient times. And note that Luke does not actually describe the census being carried out through the entire empire. He merely states that Augustus decided and made it official policy that the entire Roman world be registered \n \n And it appears that Luke was on to something. As Ben Witherington notes:\n If Luke is not simply indulging in rhetorical hyperbole, it is not absolutely necessary to take Luke 2:1 to mean that the whole empire was enrolled at once. What the Greek suggests is that Caesar decreed that \"all of the Roman world be enrolled.\" The present tense of the verb apographo and the use of pos suggest that what Caesar was decreeing was the extension of the enrollment already going on in some parts of the empire to the rest of the empire. Historian A.N. Sherwin-White reminds us, \"A census or taxation-assessment of the whole provincial empire . . . was certainly accomplished for the first time in history under Augustus.\"\n \n New Testament History, page 65.",

   "If only Orion knew the Truth about Truth?\n \n There is no Evangelical or Liberal Truth. Trust is Truth.\n \n Perhaps, Professor Douglas Groothuis can help Orion out:\n \n The correspondence view of truth entails that propositional or declarative statements are subject to various kinds of verification and falsification. A statement can be proven false if it can be shown to disagree with objective reality.\n \n Therefore, Christians&#8212;who historically have affirmed (whether implicitly or explicitly) the correspondence view of truth&#8212;hold that there are good historical reasons to believe that Jesus Christ rose from the dead in space-time history, thus vindicating his divine authority (see Romans 1:4; 1 Corinthians 15:1-11). The Apostle Paul was adamant about this: &#8220;And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith. More than that, we are then found to be false witnesses about God, for we have testified about God that he raised Christ from the dead&#8221; (1 Corinthians 15:14-15). Without the correspondence view of truth, these resounding affirmations can only ring hollow.\n \n Today this view of truth is being brought into doubt by certain postmodernist philosophers who claim that the quest for an objective truth that is describable through language is part of the discredited project of modernism, an over-confident approach to knowledge stemming from Enlightenment rationalism. Therefore, statements about scientific facts, religious realities, or moral principles cannot be known to refer to objective states of affairs. On the contrary, language is contingently constructed through communities; it cannot transcend its own context and refer to realities outside itself. \n \n A thorough analysis of this postmodernism assault on truth would take us beyond the limits of this essay, but a basic critique of its notion of truth is that this view is self-refuting. If all language fails to describe objective conditions, because of its embeddedness in various cultures, then any language used to describe this universal embeddedness would be subject to the limitations of its context, and so fail to describe the universal limitations of all languages.2 For all its protests about the illegitimacies of &#8220;metanarratives&#8221; (comprehensive explanations of reality), postmodernism covertly (and illogically) presents a metanarrative of its own.3\n \n Moreover, the notion that objective truth is unknowable entails that a relativistic and/or pragmatic view of truth be put in the place of a correspondence view. I will argue below that both of these views are logically unsupportable. \n \n One challenge to the correspondence view is relativism. Relativism comes in various shapes and sizes, but its salient claim is that the truth of a statement depends on the views of persons or cultures, not on whether statements correspond to objective reality. For a statement to be true simply means that a person or culture to believes it to be true. Hence the popular refrain, &#8220;Well, if that&#8217;s true for you . . .&#8221; or, &#8220;We can&#8217;t judge other cultures.&#8221; According to this view, one person can say &#8220;Jesus is Lord&#8221; and another can say &#8220;Allah is Lord,&#8221; and both statements will be true, if they accurately express the sentiments of the speakers. This view seems to advance tolerance and civility, but it does so at the expense of logic. \n \n If I say &#8220;Jesus is Lord&#8221; and you say &#8220;Allah is Lord&#8221; both statements cannot be objectively true because they describe mutually exclusive realities. Jesus is known by Christians as God made flesh (John 1:14), while Muslims deny that Allah incarnates. If &#8220;Lord&#8221; means a position of unrivaled metaphysical and spiritual supremacy, then Jesus and Allah cannot be both be Lord because &#8220;Jesus&#8221; and &#8220;Allah&#8221; are not two words that mean the same thing. If we mean to say that I believe in Jesus and you believe in Allah, there is no logical contradiction, since subjective states of mind cannot contradict each other; that is, it may be true that I subjectively believe X and you subjectively believe non-X. But X and non-X themselves cannot both be objectively true. When dealing with divergent claims to objective truth (as we often do in comparative religion and philosophy), contradictions emerge frequently.4\n \n When truth is deemed dependent upon the person or culture holding the belief, anything can become &#8220;true,&#8221; which is absurd.\n \n Moreover, relativism is self-refuting; it cuts its own throat. The statement, &#8220;truth is a matter of personal and cultural values, not a matter of a statement&#8217;s correspondence with objective reality,&#8221; is a claim about &#8220;the ways things are&#8221;; that is, it is a truth-claim about objective reality. But this is the very thing it cannot be. If truth is only a function of individual preferences, one cannot escape the prison of subjectivity in order to make objective statements that supposedly apply to all of reality. For these reasons, we can safely say that relativism is false; it does not correspond to reality.\n \n Douglas Grootuis, Ph.D. - Click HERE",

   "Matthew and Luke, each, present us with the genealogy of Jesus\n\n \n One more time!\n \n Why are there different genealogies for Jesus in Matthew 1 and Luke 3? \n \n Matthew 1:16 - Luke 3:23\n \n Both Matthew 1 and Luke 3 contain genealogies of Jesus. But there is one problem. They are different. Luke's Genealogy starts at Adam and goes to David. Matthew's Genealogy starts at Abraham and goes to David. When the genealogies arrive at David, they split with David's sons: Nathan (Mary's side) and Solomon (Joseph's side).\n \n There is no discrepancy because one genealogy is for Mary and the other is for Joseph.\n \n It was customary to mention the genealogy through the father even though it was clearly known that it was through Mary.\n \n Some critics may not accept this explanation no matter what reasoning is produced. \n \n Nevertheless, they should first realize that the Bible should be interpreted in the context of its literary style, culture, and history. \n \n Breaking up genealogies into male and female representations was acceptable in the ancient Near East culture since it was often impolite to speak of women without proper conditions being met: male presence, etc. \n \n Therefore, one genealogy is of Mary and the other of Joseph, even though both mention Joseph. In other words, the Mary was counted \"in\" Joseph and under his headship. Second, do any critics actually think that those who collected the books of the New Testament, and who believed it was inerrant, were unaware of this blatant differentiation in genealogies? Does anyone actually think that the Christians were so dense that they were unaware of the differences in the genealogy lists, closed their eyes and put the gospels into the canon anyway hoping no one would notice? Not at all. They knew the cultural context and had no problem with it knowing that one was of Joseph and the other of Mary. Third, notice that Luke starts with Mary and goes backwards to Adam. Matthew starts with Abraham and goes forward to Joseph. The intents of the genealogies were obviously different which is clearly seen in their styles. Luke was not written to the Jews, Matthew was. Therefore, Matthew would carry the legal line (from Abraham through David) and Luke the biological one (from Adam through David). Also, notice that Luke's first three chapters mention Mary eleven times; hence, the genealogy from her. Fourth, notice Luke 3:23, \"And when He began His ministry, Jesus Himself was about thirty years of age, being supposedly the son of Joseph, the son of Eli,\" This designation \"supposedly\" seems to signify the Marian genealogy since it seems to indicate that Jesus is not the biological son of Joseph.\n \n CARN.org - Click Here for More!",

Such a theory is grossly erroneous.\n \n The Greek expression for &#8220;shortly&#8221;  (en tachei) has at least two possible meanings. First, it can denote chronological nearness (cf. Acts 25:4). Even when it has reference to time, though, in prophetic literature it can be used in an extremely relative sense. Leon Morris observes that &#8220;in the prophetic perspective the future is sometimes foreshortened. In other words the word may refer primarily to the certainty of the events in question&#8221; (The Revelation of St. John, p. 45). \n \n It is possible that the reference may simply denote that the things foretold in this book would commence (though not complete) their unfolding in the near future. \n \n Second,  en tachei can mean &#8220;quickly, speedily&#8221; (cf. Luke 18:8; Acts 12:7). This would suggest that the events - whenever they transpire, near or distant - would occur without delay, suddenly. It is thus a serious mistake to make the prophetic time frame of the book of Revelation hinge on this solitary expression. Underline &#8220;shortly,&#8221; and note: Term can refer to speed, rather than time; see Acts 12:7; Luke 18:8",

   "The Birth of Jesus By Jon Meacham - Newsweek Magazine - (December 13, 2004 issue) - Click Here\n \n Well, it's that time of year again, when the skeptics come out to question the Gospel, Mary and the Virgin Birth. Here is a direct quote from the Newsweek article, as they play to the skeptics and Biblical nihilists:\n \"... as with so many other elements of faith, the Nativity narratives are the subject of ongoing scholarly debate over their historical accuracy, their theological meaning and whether some of the central images and words of the Christian religion owe as much to the pagan culture of the Roman Empire as they do to apostolic revelation. \n \n The clash between literalism and a more historical view of faith is also playing out in theaters and bookstores.\n A NEWSWEEK Poll found that 84 percent of American adults consider themselves Christians, and 82 percent see Jesus as God or the son of God. Seventy-nine percent say they believe in the virgin birth, and 67 percent think the Christmas story-from the angels' appearance to the Star of Bethlehem-is historically accurate.\n \n I consider the Newsweek article hostile to my faith, and yet, history records that these unfounded claims and Anti-Christ attacks are nothing new for the Bible and the Christian faith.\n \n Jewish Babylonian Talmud charges that Christ (Who is called Ben Pandera) was born out of wedlock after His mother had been seduced by a Roman soldier named Pandera or Panthera. Respected scholar Bruce Metzger has commented upon this appellation: \n \n \"The defamatory account of his birth seems to reflect a knowledge of the Christian tradition that Jesus was the son of the virgin Mary, the Greek word for virgin, parthenos, being distorted into the name Pandera\".\n The article mentions, Celsus, a pagan philosopher of the second century A.D., who produced the oldest extant literary attack against Christianity. His True Discourse (c. A.D. 178) was a bitter assault upon Christ. Celsus argued that Jesus was born in low circumstances, being the illegitimate son of a soldier named Panthera. (Note the recycled lie and the original source)\n \n So far from a \"new\" debate, this kind scurrilous mud slinging is very old! The Newsweek article runs through canard after false charge. It is alleged, that the Christian birth \"myth\" runs parallel to the story surrounding Caesar Augustus, whose mother was believed to be impregnated by the sun god, Apollo. \n \n That is like saying, \"Elephants have ears; I have ears; therefore, I am an elephant.\"\n \n O.K. Skeptics and Biblical Nihilists, you have everything you could ever want in this article, Herod the Great slaughtering of the Innocents? Mary and Joseph as residents of Bethlehem who were later forced to move north to Nazareth? You have: The Great Census Debate, Luke (2:1-3):\n \"In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world. (This was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria.) And everyone went to his own town to register.\"\n You have the (Anti) \"Jesus Seminar\", who want to \"de-mythologize,\" and thus \"sanitize,\" the sacred New Testament documents. You have Ms. Elaine Pagels and her Gnostic Gospel of Philip reducing Jesus to a spiritual Son of God. So enjoy this thread and more questions to ponder: Isaiah 7:14 - Did Isaiah Prophesy the Virgin Birth of Christ?\n<P<\n \n Hello Richbee, and Jon Meacham,\n \n I' am Interested In Knowing The Truth of The Record/Birth of Jesus Christ / \n \n http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?p=82397#post82397\n \n Love always, Fr: Bro. and Sis.\n \n Walter, Jr. and Deborah, La.\n \n http://www.firstthing1st.com :)",
