   "Recently made this post on another forum.\n \n http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/08/this_could_be_a_dreary_mistake.php\n \nI've agreed to another talk radio debate - this time it's not a Christian radio station, so there's hope of some ethical behavior on their part - on WDAY, AM 970 next Tuesday, 5 August, at 10am. We're supposed to debate intelligent design, and my opponent is...\n \n My opponent is...\n \n Really, I'm embarrassed to say it...\n \n My opponent is...\n \n Ray Comfort. \n\n \n This should be entertaining.\n \n Now, for those of you who don't know, this is the same guy who made the infamous \"Banana Argument\" found HERE.\n \n Don't know about you guys but that whole video makes me laugh. Let's not mention the dirty thoughts it has likely given most of you. (Perfect shape for the human mouth, eh, Comfort? I thought your type was against homosexuality! Perfectly fits in the human hand too.). emoticon_smile \n \n \n \n Now, what makes his argument even more funny is how ridiculously false it is!\n \n You see, the banana that his God created is HERE.\n \n The banana that Man created (the one in the video that he is drooling over) is HERE.\n \n Little different, huh?\n \n \n \n I look forward to listening to the debate, if only to hear what other burning tardness Comfort comes up with.",

If he outclasses him so much then he has absolutely nothing to lose by debating him, PERIOD.\n\n \n I want you to examine this, AA. This is from a website by holocaust deniers (\"revisionists\" in their terms).\n \n \nHolocaust historian and Jewish activist Deborah Lipstadt is a prominent and severe critic of Holocaust revisionism (or to use her terminology, &#8220;Holocaust denial&#8221;). As a result of the libel case brought before the High Court in London in the winter-spring of 2000 by David Irving against Lipstadt and her publisher, she and her book, Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory, are now world famous.\n \n One of her book&#8217;s primary claims is that Holocaust revisionism is utter nonsense, on par with the flat earth theory. On the dust jacket we read: &#8220;The denial of the Holocaust has no more credibility than the assertion that the earth is flat.&#8221;\n \n Despite what Lipstadt writes, if hard evidence for the Holocaust is overwhelming and the claims of revisionists ridiculous, to engage the latter in debate would not lend them credibility and respect. Quite the contrary. Crossing swords with these &#8220;cranks&#8221; would be a golden opportunity for Lipstadt to expose their alleged quackery and stupidity. Only if revisionism has intrinsic validity will it gain stature by a public hearing. The Emory University professor&#8217;s refusal to debate carries with it the implicit recognition that revisionism has more legitimacy than she cares to admit.\n\n \n My point in raising this is not to construct a straw man argument (liken your stance on this issue to that of holocaust denier) but rather to show how ridiculous it is to jump to the conclusion that someone is afraid to debate another person based solely on their refusal to participate in a debate. There are several problems with that line of reasoning:\n \n 1.) First of all, contrary to what you and this holocaust denier claim, the person in question does have something to lose by engaging in a formal debate with an individual whom they deem un-credible: their own position's strategic advantage of reputation over an opposing position. When an academic engages in a debate with a non-academic, they have suddenly given the non-academic a platform of credibility from which they may attempt to improve their position's image. Regardless of how badly I lost the debate, my resume would look rather impressive if it said I had once debated Alan Greenspan on economics. Perhaps worse is the possibility that the academic might harm the reputation of his position or even himself. To emphasize this point, I think we can agree Greenspan's image suffer if he spent his time debating college kids on economics.\n \n To summarize this point, it is perfectly plausible that PZ doesn't want to allow Vox Day the opportunity to improve his image by debating someone as popular as himself. Likewise, it's also plausible he doesn't want to be seen with the likes of Vox Day.\n \n \n 2.) To conclude that PZ is afraid of debating someone like Vox Day misses a key point about academic discourse: It is inescapable. Simply because PZ refuses to debate Vox Day in a formal setting does not mean Vox Day is unable to present his position to the scrutiny of the public eye. We can all read what PZ and Vox Day have to say about religion and science without them debating one another. Why must they debate one another? Debate involves a whole different set rhetorical tools that work irregardless of the strength of the actual arguments. Debates require time limits, public speaking ability, good preparation, and often times limited access to resources, none of which actually affect anything... except the reputation of the advocate and their position.\n \n This point is not to suggest that PZ would be unable to work in a debate setting (as he has, of course, done so many times before), but why take the time and risk when it is not necessary in the first place? Is there a reason Vox Day is unable to win in his arguments against PZ outside of a debate setting?\n \n \n 3.) This third point is rather straightforward, but it still has some legitimate weight: Maybe PZ just likes ticking Vox Day off? I share PZ's opinion that Vox Day is a spoiled, arrogant baby, and quite frankly, I like watching the spoiled, arrogant baby cry when the big boys won't debate him.\n \n \n \n \n So, I'll say it again: There are many possible reasons underlying PZ's refusal to debate Vox Day. I've provided some here, and they must be refuted before you can simply declare that PZ is afraid of Vox Day. In closing, consider another portion of the holocaust denial website:\n \n \nThe reader will now ask&#8212;what is the real reason behind her refusal to debate?\n \n This question was answered in part on July 22, 1995, the day that revisionist historian Mark Weber squared off against anti-revisionist historian Dr. Michael Shermer in an oral debate on the Holocaust. Both sides were given a fair and equal opportunity to present their case, as the audience had the opportunity to hear defenses of both the Holocaust revisionist and the traditional view of the Holocaust.3\n \n The debate was a disaster for the traditional view of the Holocaust. Weber made Holocaust revisionism look too good and Lipstadt&#8217;s Holocaust ideology severely deficient. As evidence that this is the case is suggested by the fact that some years after the debate Shermer wrote: &#8220;It is one thing to analyze the literature of deniers of or to interview them face to face; it is quite another process to confront them in a public forum, where their skills at rhetoric and debate can trip up even seasoned scholars and historians.&#8221;4\n",

   "What a load of obfuscation and false justification for not accepting a debate, even though you do show why he has a reason to fear losing it. What I get a kick out of though is your continued fallacious claim that your side is undeniably and absolutely correct in its assumption and false beliefs, while continuing to marginalize my side as ignorant quacks. \n \n The fact is that if PZ Meyers is such an exceptional intellectual with all of the facts on his side, and Vox is an ignorant quack who is promoting myths and superstitions, then Meyers has absolutely nothing to fear in reality.

And one more thing; attempting to appear like he's actually taking the high road by implying that the other guy is a spoiled brat whom he likes to frustrate and anger, say's nothing at all that's good about PZs character.

But that isn't any reason to avoid confronting the opposition. I have read Dawkins and Myers web sites and have seen their sanctimonious and belittling rants which do nothing but insult, degrade and demonize believers in God and Creationists. They are very brave and gutsy when they can't be challenged. \n \n But when it comes to actually defending their religion of atheism against qualified opponents, they can come up with all kinds of belittling and condescending excuses as to why defending their beliefs is below them. And just to prove how shallow your excuses have been for PZ regarding his desire not to debate someone he deems below him intellectually, I refer you back to the OP of this thread where he say's this: \n \n My opponent is&#8230;Really, I'm embarrassed to say it&#8230; My opponent is&#8230; Ray Comfort. Again with the condescension and the sanctimony, but you notice that he's not to proud to debate someone he deems below him on every level. I guess he just feels very confident he can beat this one. But to absolutely put this issue to rest, here is Vox's invitation and again, PZs sanctimonious and condescending response as he berates and insults a man he is unwilling to face in the arena of fair debate.\n An invitation to PZ Myers\n Dear Dr. Myers,\n \n You recently complained that you've never found any intelligent arguments for gods and said the reason you only addressed the weak arguments was because you were unaware of the strong ones. Happily, not only did I hear this intellectual cri de coeur, but so did the good hosts of the Northern Alliance Radio Show in your home state of Minnesota.\n \n So, no doubt you will be delighted to hear that they have invited the two of us to debate the existence of gods on their show this coming Saturday. It is my contention that there is not only substantial evidence for the existence of gods, but that the logic for the existence of gods is superior to the logic for the nonexistence of them as presented by yourself, Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, and Daniel Dennett, to name a few.\n \n I have accepted the invitation to the show and I hope you will soon do likewise. You can let them know if you intend to show up and defend your side or not by emailing The Elder at rightwinger23 at hotmail.com.\n \n With regards,\n Vox\n \n \n Since Dr. Myers does not always make a habit of reading this blog, I posted NARN's invitation on his blog as well, in addition to emailing him.\n \n Update - PZ reveals himself to be nothing but another atheist coward:\n Wait -- I complain about the absence of intelligent arguments for God, and Vox Day pops up his little pin head and squeaks about miracles and bleeding statues and liquefying holy relics? Vox, you don't qualify. You're a pathetic little twerp with delusions of grandeur.\n \n \n Typical atheist. He beats his chest and then runs away scared as soon as anyone calls him out. He's obviously afraid that he'll get exposed and then won't be able to play the big bad atheist hero of science anymore. You have to love atheist illogic... just when did I say anything about miracles, statues or relics anyhow? Run away, little professor, run away....\n You really should be more careful about who you choose for your hero's Collin, cuz this guy is a loser and a coward. And if you're really so close to him, feel free to show him this exchange. Although I doubt it will motivate him to grow a set. And by all means, invite him here to face me in a debate. I'm not afraid at all to face him.\n Vox Popoli: An invitation to PZ Myers",

   "True enough Peeling, but Collin attacked his intelligence and my response was to him in making that statement. See? You're not making any sense at all collin. We all know what a giant ego PZ has. So if he saw Vox as such a brainless XXXXX, he would gladly debate him publicly just for the kudos and prestige he would receive from his click of pseudo intellectual atheists. So you are twisting facts and changing goal posts as you redefine the debate because it's only your sides opinion that Vox is an unworthy opponent.\n\n Again, you're trying to tar me with the wrong brush. My issue, clearly stated, was with your reasoning: people do not receive kudos and prestige for crushing unworthy opponents. And because that part of your reasoning is incorrect, your deduction that Vox must be a worthy opponent of whom PZ is scared is unsupported. Do you understand? You might be right - PZ might be quaking in his boots at the thought - but the mere fact he hasn't debated Vox does not support that deduction.\n \nThat has in no way been proven in any way. I am opposing that opinion and your insistence does nothing to sway my belief that since Vox does have a following of people who respect him, it is cowardice and fear of being defeated in an open debate which is keeping PZ from debating him publicly.\n\n Again, that reasoning does not follow. There are plenty of examples (Hovind) where someone with a quite appalling grasp of a subject may nevertheless speak with sufficient conviction and apparent plausibility as to attract a following of people, usually those already predisposed to agree with his conclusions. Once more, I'm not saying you're necessarily wrong, only that your deduction does not follow.\n \n \nCare to show where he said it's no great loss? \n\n I was paraphrasing. He said that 'obviously the young man wasn't particularly intelligent', and the only regret he expressed in connection with the suicide is that the man didn't kill someone else as well first. Not 'instead'. First.\n \nAnd it is the guys own father who linked the book to the suicide and his lack of respect for life, not Vox. Only in the minds of atheists can they blame the author for commenting on an independent story in their attempt to attack and marginalize his opinions.\n\n What I blame him for is his high-minded criticism of the intellectual faculties and integrity of others, while simultaneously presenting meaningless anecdotal evidence of a single event as if it were somehow representative of the general effect of the book in question upon its readers, or in any way supported his opinion of what that effect would be.\n \nThe point vox is making is that the result of embracing atheism is the loss of respect for human life. And I agree with his opinion.\n \n Isn't it interesting at all to you that \"most\" pro-abortion advocates are atheists or secular humanists while \"most\" pro-lifers are christians or people of faith in general?\n\n Of course it's interesting. As a humanist and pragmatist I can tolerate abortion (which I think is the position of most pro-choice thinkers) because it is not - so far as medical science can determine - the murder of a sentient human being. Naturally those who have different beliefs or criteria as regards harm being done have different tolerances. You arbitrarily draw the line at conception and invoke 'potential' as your justification, which makes no sense to me at all. Sperm and egg have the same amount of potential, and yet you have no problem denying their union.\n \n At the same time, you're far more ready than I to drop bombs killing and maiming innocents we know for sure are sentient human beings, and who unquestionably feel pain and grief and fear and loss. So in terms of valuing human life, I fail to see how a humanist (the clue is in the name) comes off worst. You think it can be OK to kill an innocent human being. I don't. You only think I do because we differ on our opinions of what counts as a human being.",

Especially since your side has absolute proof of nothing at all. Yet you speak as though you're dealing from a position of scientifically proven FACTS against witch doctors. The arrogance, sanctimony and elitism which your side exhibits is mind numbing when you haven't proven a darn thing regarding the non existence of God or the conclusiveness of biological evolution. \n \n \nOf course it's interesting.

You insist on drawing the line at sentience as if that determines when life becomes relevant. But every scientist today knows enough to admit with confidence that LIFE starts at conception when the fertilized egg starts to grow. It's very growth is evidence that it is alive. And It's that atheist ethic that allows you to distinguish between life and sentience as you approve of a million plus abortions each year in this country.\n \n You (atheists) are so shallow in your world view that you fail to recognize that you, yourself was once a pre-sentient fetus, yet look what you are today. How dare you play a game of semantics with the unborn when you know without doubt that if given the chance, those unborn babies will one day be as vibrant, vital and valuable as you are with similar hopes, dreams, fears and desires that you have. How dare you atheists and humanists subjectively deny them life due to some shallow intellectual argument which denies their ultimate humanity just because of their current size and level of development.\n \n You claim to be intelligent and yet you dare say that a sperm and an egg has the same potential as a fertilized egg? Take a sperm or an egg and try to grow them by themselves and let me know when they grow into a sentient being; it will never happen. that is the depth of your justification for allowing a mass genocide each year which adds up to a current tally of 40 MILLION + as we speak after 35 years of legalized abortions. Do you see why I can't respect what you represent with such shallow and empty beliefs? Yet I'm supposed to be intimidated by the intellectual prowess of atheists and secular humanists? Not in this lifetime peeling.\n \n \nAt the same time, you're far more ready than I to drop bombs killing and maiming innocents we know for sure are sentient human beings, and who unquestionably feel pain and grief and fear and loss. So in terms of valuing human life, I fail to see how a humanist (the clue is in the name) comes off worst. You think it can be OK to kill an innocent human being. I don't. You only think I do because we differ on our opinions of what counts as a human being.\n\n \n Again Peeling, you disappoint me in the shallowness of your world view. You would sit by for decades feeling enlightened as the mass graves continued to add up in the iraqi desert. But in your shallow world view, it is america which is wrong for stopping that carnage. In the real world, wars happen between Nations. And with modern warfare collateral damage takes place and people die. That is when bombs are dropped in most cases. Unless you consider radical islam; they purposely target civilians and drive jets into high rise buildings. Strangely enough though I never hear atheists and humanists complaining about what they represent.\n \n Even though the US never dropped one bomb with the intent of killing innocent people. I remember during the Iraqi invasion how our smart bombs threaded needles in order to hit only Government buildings and military targets. I specifically remember the outrage and ensuing apologies when we accidently hit a mosque on a night sortie. And it wasn't even an error, it was bad intel on the building itself. In other words, the pilot hit his target, but the map was wrong. \n \n We don't kill innocents on purpose. In fact if the radical islamic insurgents weren't there blowing up innocent moslems, we would have been gone years ago. But you prefer to believe that because I support the war against murderous terrorists that I am some trigger happy, blood thirsty war monger. Well here's a clue peeling; in 1981 when Reagan sent weapons to the mohajadeen in Afghanistan to stop the Soviets who were dropping booby trapped toys in order to blow up the children to demoralize their parents, I also applauded that action. \n \n So my standing up and supporting any war in my lifetime has never been for the love of war. It has been based on the love for the oppressed and dying victims of the aggressors whose brutality and inhumane treatment of the innocents needed to be confronted. So our differences are based in the most fundamental philosophical differences regarding how we view the world we live in. And your so called intellectual approach is nothing of the sort in the real world. That's why talking to terrorists doesn't work. They don't want to talk. They want us to either convert to islam or die. There is no middle ground with them. \n \n The term live and let live doesn't exist in their vocabulary. We either surrender or they will kill as many fellow moslems as it takes to kill us. You know why that is Peeling? Because they believe if they kill 10,000 faithful moslems in order to kill 20,000 infidels, that's just fine to the radicals because they're just sending the faithful moslems to paradise as martyrs in their small minds. That is the mentality of the enemy we face as you accuse our country of indiscriminately dropping bombs on innocents. My question is, why don't I ever see you people ranting over our common enemy who dreams about holding a sword over YOUR CHILDREN'S NECK one day, as well as mine?",

   "And I'm saying that your claim that Vox is an unworthy opponent is nothing more than a subjective opinion which could only be proven by debating him, and proving it. \n\n I didn't claim he was an unworthy opponent. I merely exposed the flaws in your deduction that because PZ won't debate him, he must be a worthy opponent. Please stop putting words in my mouth.\n \n(It does not follow that because Vox has supporters his position must have merit) Sure it does. In the real world anyway. Especially since your side has absolute proof of nothing at all. Yet you speak as though you're dealing from a position of scientifically proven FACTS against witch doctors. The arrogance, sanctimony and elitism which your side exhibits is mind numbing when you haven't proven a darn thing regarding the non existence of God or the conclusiveness of biological evolution.\n\n Nobody to my knowledge, least of all me, has claimed to have proof of the non-existence of god. We do have overwhelming evidence that the dominant religious creation narratives are incorrect or at best metaphorical, which in turn undermines any justification for belief in the rest of the theistic 'package'. And it's hard to think of anything we have more evidence for than biological evolution :)\n \nTo prove I'm not arbitrarily drawing the line at conception let me respond to the bolded. You insist on drawing the line at sentience as if that determines when life becomes relevant. But every scientist today knows enough to admit with confidence that LIFE starts at conception when the fertilized egg starts to grow. It's very growth is evidence that it is alive. And It's that atheist ethic that allows you to distinguish between life and sentience as you approve of a million plus abortions each year in this country.\n\n Do you eat meat? Or vegetables? Do you swat flies? Then you are also prepared to distinguish between life and sentience. And before you attribute any more incorrect opinions to me: no, I don't equate aborting a foetus with swatting a fly or munching on a grape. Here's how it works: swatting flies is tolerable because there are sound practical justifications and the harm caused is judged to be minimal. Farming plants and animals is tolerable because there are sound practical justifications, so long as the harm done is minimised (I vote with my wallet and support ethical farming practices). Aborting a foetus is tolerable because - you guessed it - there are sound practical justifications and medical science allows us to determine the threshold below which harm could be said to be done.\n \nYou (atheists) are so shallow in your world view that you fail to recognize that you, yourself was once a pre-sentient fetus, yet look what you are today. How dare you play a game of semantics with the unborn when you know without doubt that if given the chance, those unborn babies will one day be as vibrant, vital and valuable as you are with similar hopes, dreams, fears and desires that you have.\n\n How dare you not be having sex right now, thus denying the sperm in you and the egg in your wife the chance of union, when you know without doubt that if given the chance that sperm and egg would one day be as vibrant, vital and valuable as you are, with similar hopes, dreams, fears and desires?\n \n Of course I know I was once a pre-sentient foetus. And before that I was one egg nestling in my mother and one of a few hundred million sperm sloshing around in my dad. That was me, every bit as much as when the two came together. Man, I wish I hadn't said that.\n \nYou claim to be intelligent and yet you dare say that a sperm and an egg has the same potential as a fertilized egg? Take a sperm or an egg and try to grow them by themselves and let me know when they grow into a sentient being; it will never happen.\n\n Ok. And while I'm doing that, you try making a fertilized egg without a sperm and an egg.\n \nAgain Peeling, you disappoint me in the shallowness of your world view. You would sit by for decades feeling enlightened as the mass graves continued to add up in the iraqi desert. But in your shallow world view, it is america which is wrong for stopping that carnage.\n\n With respect, I don't think you have the first clue what my view of that issue is :) We can discuss it elsewhere if you like, but it's tangential to the point here.\n \nIn the real world, wars happen between Nations. And with modern warfare collateral damage takes place and people die. That is when bombs are dropped in most cases.<snip< But you prefer to believe that because I support the war against murderous terrorists that I am some trigger happy, blood thirsty war monger. Well here's a clue peeling; in 1981 when Reagan sent weapons to the mohajadeen in Afghanistan to stop the Soviets who were dropping booby trapped toys in order to blow up the children to demoralize their parents, I also applauded that action.\n\n I'm sure you think you're demolishing my argument here, but in truth you're making my point for me. You're a pragmatist, not an idealist. Just like me. You don't say 'Killing innocents is so absolutely wrong that we must never, ever do it - we must merely endure and allow god to punish the evil and reward the righteous.' No: you draw a line and say 'Killing innocents is tolerable when there are sound practical justifications, so long as the harm done is minimised'. You believe yourself to be my moral superior, yet you employ precisely the same reasoning.\n \nMy question is, why don't I ever see you people ranting over our common enemy who dreams about holding a sword over YOUR CHILDREN'S NECK one day, as well as mine?\n\n The irony of you talking about there being 'no middle ground' with terrorists, and then referring to me as 'you people' is, frankly, crushing.\n \n But I'll answer the question anyway, however rudely it was phrased. The reason I don't 'rant' over our 'common enemy' is that there's nothing to discuss. Terrorists killing innocents = bad. People who want to blow up civilians should be stopped. Ok? Happy now? Have I demonstrated my membership of the human race to your satisfaction?\n \n When people rant about terrorism, they are employing the same principle as terrorists themselves: using fear to further their agenda. In the wake of the twin towers attacks the Bush administration used fear to undermine American civil liberties in the name of preserving liberty. That's what ranting about terrorism is for. You're doing the same thing here: I indirectly reference Iraq and you start banging on about terrorists holding swords over my child's throat, as if the two were in any way related - as if any course of action other than the specific 'shock and awe' bombing campaign conducted, and the subsequent seizing and fire-sale of Iraqi assets to American companies, would have resulted in the inevitable decapitation of my baby girl.
