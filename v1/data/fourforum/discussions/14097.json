   "Now, I'd have to say that there weren't any Mensa members amongst this pirate raiding party. They attacked a US Navy frigate, LOL....\n \n\n Suspected pirates nabbed after skirmish with U.S. Navy ship\n By the CNN Wire Staff \n April 1, 2010 10:27 a.m. EDT\n (CNN) -- A group of suspected pirates was captured Thursday after attacking a U.S. Navy frigate in the Indian Ocean, according to a statement released by the U.S. Sixth Fleet.\n The USS Nicholas reported taking fire from a suspected pirate skiff shortly after midnight local time west of the Seychelles, the statement said. The Nicholas quickly returned fire and began pursuing the skiff, which was eventually disabled. A boarding team from the Nicholas subsequently captured and detained three people, the statement said.\n The team discovered ammunition and several cans of fuel aboard the skiff, which was later sunk by the Nicholas.\n Two more suspected pirates were captured on a confiscated \"mother ship,\" the statement said. The detainees will \"remain in U.S. custody on board Nicholas until a determination is made regarding their disposition,\" it said.\n Suspected pirates nabbed after skirmish with U.S. Navy ship - CNN.com \n",

   "And we plucked these pirates from the water because...? Oh well, I guess we have to be humanitarians and all. You know, I think as a gesture of good will towards all Somali pirates, we should plop them back in the water and let them swim home. We could tie T-bones and fresh tuna around their necks so they can have a cookout when they get back to shore. Hell, if we were really nice, we could lay down a long chum line to stain the water red to show them the path back home.",
