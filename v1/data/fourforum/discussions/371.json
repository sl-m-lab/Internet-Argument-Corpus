   "Although the little town of Moab, Utah hates this kind of publicity, I think the MOAB will be good for business, military business. In an effort to further intimidate the Iraqi Army, and deter them from actually fighting, the Pentagon released word of its latest addition to its long list of ordance, the MOAB. MOAB is short for Massive Ordance Air Burst, and it puts the Daisy Cutter to shame. Certainly, this is another one of today's engineering marvels. This 21,000 pound bomb will surely instill fear in the hearts of men, as its impact is similar to that of a small nuclear weapon. Good move, Rumsfeld. Nice use of Psyops to further shake up the Republican Guard. Hooray for explosives!\n \n source: ABC News",
