I saw him on television, he's on all the shows, and everything I see on TV is real.\n 9. - Because he goes through all the hassle of decorating Easter Eggs, every year, no body's that patient.\n 10. - Hay, if a hippity hop Chocolate giving Bunny wants to give me 'Guilt Free' Chocolate, who am I to argue?\n 11. - Because if he's not real, than I really have to rethink my fondest childhood memories, and that's too much work.\n 12. - I once had an Easter Egg that read, Made in Easter Bunny Land.

It's silly, but I believe.\n \n Fred Gailey: Look Doris, someday you're going to find that your way of facing this realistic world just doesn't work. And when you do, don't overlook those lovely intangibles. You'll discover those are the only things that are worthwhile.\n \n Doris: Faith is believing when common sense tells you not to. Don't you see? It's not just the Easter Bunny that's on trial, it's everything he stands for. It's kindness and joy and love and all the other intangibles.\n \n Charles Halloran: All right, you go back and tell them that the New York State Supreme Court rules there's no Easter Bunny. It's all over the papers. The kids read it and they don't Colour their Easter Baskets and Eggs. Now what happens to all of the Chocolates that are supposed to be in those Easter Baskets? Nobody buys them. The Chocolate manufacturers are going to like that; so they have to lay off a lot of their employees, union employees. Now you got the CIO and the AF of L against you and they're going to adore you for it and they're going to say it with votes. Oh, and the grocery stores are going to love you too and the Easter Card makers and department stores. Hare hare. Henry, you're going to be an awful popular fella. And what about the synagogues, churches, mosques? Why, they got an Easter Bunny on every corner, and they're taking a fortune. But you go ahead Henry, you do it your way. You go on back in there and tell them that you rule there is no Easter Bunny. Go on... But if you do, remember this: you can count on getting just two votes, your own and that District Attorney's out there.\n \n Judge Henry X. Harper: The District Attorney's a Republican.\n \n Mr. R.

Wenatchee!\n O! Say Lucifer Light\n \n The modern use of git r done was developed in the early 90's by hard working white males who reached a point in their life where they wanted to actually accomplish something in life... instead of getting completely hammered and rebuilding transmissions, they started doing projects that really mattered - projects like fixing the mailbox, cleaning the house, possibly even taking a few loads to the dump. This sudden surge of progress made these men feel good, like they were doing something. So, they had to have a way in their simple minds to reaffirm that feeling of getting something done. Thus, \"GIT R DONE!\" was born. This can be said before a task is completed to motivate them, or after a task is completed to celebrate. It is also used profusely during the process of completing a task for no apparent reason which is very obnoxious and ambient. Often used with a drawn out \"Woooooo! Hoooooo!\" yelling before or after. GIT R DONE!\n \n Urban Dictionary: git r done - GIT R DONE\n \n Hay, i Like these Morgans,\n O!

   "Happy Bash Thursday!\n WAMKQ WAMPQ WAMUQ\n \n Ol' Harry Houdini '77\n \n Dhondini discovered Garry Denke knew 'Nothing'.\n O! Say See maybe Law of Fives help WM stock.\n \n &#931;&#969;&#954;&#961;&#940;&#964;&#951;&#962; &#935;&#333;kr\u00e1t&#275;s \n \n LAW OF FIVES\n \n The Law of Fives is summarized in the Principia Discordia: The Law of Fives states simply that: All things happen in fives, or are divisible by or are multiples of five, or are somehow directly or indirectly appropriate to 5.\n \n The Law of Fives is never wrong.\n -Malaclypse the Younger\n -Principia Discordia - Page 2\n Principia Discordia - Page 2 \n -Page 1 6\n \n Happy Bash Thursday!\n WAMKQ WAMPQ WAMUQ\n \n Like most of Discordianism, the Law of Fives appears on the surface to be either some sort of weird joke, or bizarre supernaturalism; but under this, it may help clarify the Discordian view of how the human mind works; Lord Omar is quoted later on the same page as having written, \"I find the Law of Fives to be more and more manifest the harder I look.\" Appendix Beth of Robert Shea's and Robert Anton Wilson's The Illuminatus! Trilogy considers some of the numerology of Discordianism, and the question of what would happen to the Law of Fives if everyone had six fingers on each hand. The authors assert that the real Law of Fives is realizing that everything can be related to the number five if you try hard enough. Sometimes the steps required may be highly convoluted. Another way of looking at the Law of Fives is as a symbol for the observation of reality changing that which is being observed in the observer's mind. Just as how when one looks for fives in reality, one finds them, so will one find conspiracies, ways to determine when the apocalypse will come, and so on and so forth when one decides to look for them. It cannot be wrong, because it proves itself reflexively when looked at through this lens.\n \n THE INSIDE STORY\n Principia Discordia - Page 16\n Principia Discordia - Page 16\n -Page 1 6\n \n Anagrams of Garry Denke\n 77 Found; Displaying All: \n \n Law of 5.1 = Grander key\n Law of 5.2 = -Willy Billy-\n Law of 5.3 = Dark energy \n Law of 5.4 = Energy dark\n Law of 5.5 = Nark greedy\n Law of 5.6 = Key grander\n Law of 5.7 = Edgy ranker\n \n Page 1 + 6 = 7\n Internet Anagram Server : Anagrams for GarryDenke\n Internet Anagram Server : Anagrams for GarryDenke\n Seventy Seven\n \n Happy Bash Thursday!\n WAMKQ WAMPQ WAMUQ\n \n Confusion of \"Ash Wednesday\" and \"Crash Wednesday\" (day after Mardi Gras) with The Easter Bunny festival \"Bash Thursday\", having Good and Evil meanings (take your pick PW), caused The Name change.\n \n O!
