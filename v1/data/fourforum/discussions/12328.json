Also done polling and other data collections stuff.\n Very boring...and easily abused.\n \n What I did was actually read the study and use logic and reasoning.\n \n \n In the US, 6600-6700ish people die yearly while waiting for an organ according to the study. 18 a day die according to the study.\n According to the study, Only about 28% of Americans have bothered signing up to give away organs upon death. \n Only about half of relatives, when asked, give consent for harvesting. As I pointed out, parents aren't naturally willing to give consent when a doc asks for their little babies organs...grief is selfish and most can't bear the thought that their losses aren't being appreciated and the grizzly, inhumane doctor is only concerned with saving someone else. Not rational. But, that's grief. Furthermore, finding organs suitable for small children...ones who die all the time to accidents and such...isn't easy. They account for a lot of those 'waiting for a donor.'\n This is for the US and an 'informed consent' issue.\n By removing the informed and pushing it to presumed, unless someone specifically states 'don't do it' it will automatically done. Given time under this method, society will accept it as the norm and right thing to do. \n 'Informed' only works when a person's mind isn't clouded with irrational, knee-jerking reactions.\n \n Using the stats given, a 3 per million population increase (the study's own findings) translates to about 900 per year more 'donations'.\n Comparing the numbers given and using a 'real world understanding' to the topic would lead one to believe that a reduction of 18 deaths per day to roughly 15 per day is a huge step.\n One that cost little to nothing to achieve.\n \n \n This is analogous to rolling your dice several million times using one particular rolling method and getting average rolls and then rolling them a different way (yes, you can cheat in rolling dice) and getting something different.\n \n What Art was doing was editing to support his belief.\n 15 per million (POPULATION) is about the same as 18 per million (POPULATION).\n Omitting 'population' multipliers and failing to compare the results gathered to the numbers needed.\n \n To see this in context, think about it like this.\n \"If you only had a 100% increase in donations, no one would die at all while waiting for a transplant.\"\n \n Hey man, I can squeek out about 20% with this cheap method.\n \n \"Oh, sorry, that's not enough. I'm looking for the magic 100% number.\"\n \n What the...?\n \n We're not looking to feed a starving army on human organs...just looking to scrap a few more out to meed demands.

But it would not be a silver bullet, nor would it be better policy than a market.\n\n \n The 'small numbers' quoted were per million in population. Population = number of people alive. It over looks the fact that not all of those people die at once.\n If the numbers given were stated at per X deceaded, then the factor is increased.\n \n 1 million people = 15 harvested donors. (a tiny fraction like you mentioned...and, for the purpose of propaganda...insignificant, so increasing it by 20% 'won't matter'. Which is what you seem to be stating.)\n But that's from a living pool. Not from the smaller pool of those who actually die and donate the majority of organs used.\n 1 million people = deaths of abut 8,260 (deaths in US per million).\n 8,260 deaths = a mere 15 donors. Still, a relatively small number.\n But, for propaganda purposes, not as insignificant as when you state 'millions'.\n But, what is the number per anything (millions) of people NEEDING organs?\n The US Dept of health and human services states that there are 92,000 on the waiting list with the '18 dying per day' numbers.\n That's about 307 per million population that needs organ donations.\n \n If, as I stated, organs went to those in need 1st (before they died), the death rate woud decrease significantly.\n That, I admit, is idealistic.\n Still, when all we're looking for is organs to satisfy a small number like 307 per million, an increase of 3 per million donors (your study's numbers) is 1% of the numbers needed.\n According to the DHHS numbers, one donor can provide organs to save 50 people (again, an idealistic number), yet, if true, we have even MORE people taken off the waiting list. Potentially half.\n \n It's also a fact that not all deceased people can be viable donors for organ transplant.\n Just as it's a fact that many of the living people you want to buy organs from can't sell them for many reasons (unusable organs or donation leads to death of donor).\n \n As the study stated, for the US, ~6700 people die per year due to lack of organ donations.\n As the study states, informed consent results in a paltry 28% of people signing the donor cards. When asked, only half of the family members give consent for harvesting. As I pointed out, there are some sever, irrational reactions from grief when such people are asked that results in viable organs going to waste.\n Remove that random element and you'd see an increase in harvested organs.\n \n Either by a factor of close to 2 to 4.\n Which would either cover ALL those waiting on the list needing organs or come a hell of a lot closer to it.\n \n \n Now, I will agree with you that in PRACTICE, presumed consent won't cover every need, but when looking at your study (come on, they used Turkey as one of the examples...how many transplants does Turkey even do?), presumed consent will go a long ways to helping.\n One of the factors that would change is perception.\n \n I for one am all for donations, but as a parent, I even get a little knee-jerky when I think about my own children dying and whether I'd voluntarily give their organs to another to help them.\n With the right campaign, and harvesting automatically being done (just like they do autopsies...another fact that people don't think about...\"what? they hacked my baby up?\") people will eventually accept it as the right and normal thing to do. It won't even be much of a thought to the family of the deceased except in cases of religious convictions (like Jehovah's Witnesses).\n \n At the end of this month, my wife is going to FL to help an old friend to deal with the recent loss of her young daughter. Last Sept., she burned to death in a bus accident (was in the national news). In the recent months, grief has done some interesting things to her. She is angry and bitter that it was 'her little girl' and not 'someone else's brat'. \n This is the type of parent who does not donate organs...even if there were any viable ones.\n Many years ago, my wife also lost her older brother. I doubt her parents were in any frame of mind to donate organs when asked.\n \n What I'm saying is that, in a real world setting, the numbers and psychological issues involved would lead one to believe that, for the US and any nation that does many organ transplants, going to a presumed consent rule from informed consent would help significantly.\n \n As to allowing people to sell organs.\n I do think there can be some merit in that but the safeguards needed to prevent abuses could be costly and detrimental.\n I personally have looked into donating a kidney and bone marrow in the past. \n I do think a financial incentive could help in some cases.\n I believe, that if such (until another method is found) the allowances of a kidney to be 'sold' would help in many situations and probalby have collateral effects in society.\n Like encouraging people to live and eat more healthily as they want to preserve the value of their kidneys. \n This is turn may lead to fewer people getting ill and needing a transplant themselves later in life, thus fewer people added to the list.\n \n \n \n Of course, I also believe that some people shouldn't be added to the list to begin with. The elderly, those who's getting a new organ won't extend their life span by much. But, that's just me.\n \n \n Basically, what I was upset over is how 'stats' can be manipulated to imply or state much of whatever you want them to. More so if you are selective in what you're presenting. \n \n It does 'look bad' when I state that an increase from 15 to 18 per million is insignificant.\n But, when I state that the target number I'm looking for is 307 and each increase in the first number can reduce the other by up to 50.\n An increase of 3 donors per million can possibly reduce the 307 number down to 157 (under highly ideal circumstances).\n And it's even better if I state that 15 per million can actually be doubled to 30 per million with presumed consent (only half of family members give consent and that is now doubled to all) because with the multiple organs per donor, we can take even more people off the list. Potentially all.\n \n Potentially. But, as mentioned, probably not all. \n \n Personally speaking, I think that any easy reduction to the list of people waiting for transplants for little cost (other than the cost of the procedures) is worth it. I'm also sure that if you or a loved one were waiting on a donor, you'd also see that to be true as it would increase you odds of getting one.\n \n One of the things about selling organs though is that if it becomes widely used, the market could become flooded and the going rate declines (supply and demand), This would see-saw back and forth until an equilibrium is reached but, the prices of high demand organs (rare blood type) could increase and that cause friction in society as some people get upset that they don't get 'the same price' that billy did. While rational minds would understand that, many people aren't rational and see conspiracies.\n \n Lamont goes into the clinic to donate his kidney and is only offered 1,000 for it. But, he knows Robert Upstein III got 25,000 for his. Do you think Lamont is going to accept that his organs are less valuable because Robert had a rarer type OR do you think some other excuse will be looked at? Like race or culture or economic standing?\n \n Also, if cash becomes an incentive, there could be a backlash in the insurance field. They could set arbitrary limits on spending for procurement of such organs. Thus, unless someone was willing to sell at that price, only the wealthy could afford to buy. Which could lead to the same social friction where the rich stay alive longer and have more time to acrue wealth...and the poor don't.\n \n An across the board blanket rule such as presumed consent bypasses a lot of that.\n \n Still, there could be some merit in regulated organ selling.\n \n \n But, heck, I'm one who'd harvest from convicts, POW's and political enemies. emoticon_xbouncer",

   "And they do not make good sense....why?\n\n \n Here's why!\n \n \n \n \n \n\n If I ever ran on a platform like this i'm positive i'd never get elected, but I still think they're some mighty good ideas:\nBoth parts of that statement are spot on. You'd never get elected because you actually think these are \"mighty good ideas\".\n \n \n \n\n 1) Organ markets. Legalize the buying and selling of human organs and save not only a ton of lives, but tons of money by cutting down on medical expenses like kidney dialysis.\nMaking a commodity of human body parts would encourage the raising of humans for slaughter, just as it did for beef cattle, chickens, turkeys, pigs, catfish, oysters and many other animals that are killed for food. It doesn't matter that the purpose for killing them would not be for food...just that the parts can be sold. After all, Perdue doesn't really care whether you eat his chicken or not. He just wants you to buy it.\n \n \n \n\n 2) Abolish the penny. The commodity value of zinc exceeds the money value of the penny. Penny transactions also take time, the value of which is worth at least several hundred million dollars annually.\n...the only good idea on your list.\n \n \n \n\n 3) Restrict the voting franchise. Like unqualified driving, voting can impose harmful, negative externalities on third parties. Voters with irrational beliefs about what constitutes effective public policy pull and level and give us ineffective government. To rectify the situation, voting should require a proficiency test or alternatively, educated individuals should be given multiple votes.\nThe entire Democratic Party would disappear. On top of that, the very principle of \"one man...one vote\" would be violated. The solution is to require that all voters be alive, that they be citizens of the district in which they vote, that they present a picture ID at the polls, that they get their finger dyed purple when they vote, that absentee ballots be counted only if there are enough of them to swing the election one way or the other AND that the votes are counted by a machine. Additionally, no candidate should be allowed to buy an election like our latest Messiah Obama did. All candidates should be restricted to public funding with NO contributions coming from people that expect to be paid back.\n \n \n \n\n 4) Government patent and copyright auctions. Patents and copyrights provide incentives for innovation but also suffer from the deadweight loss of monopoly. A solution is for private parties to auction their patents off, have the government purchase them at a substantial markup, and then immediately put them into the public domain.\nFirst, you can't call it an auction with only one buyer. Second, the only money the government has to spend is that which it steals from you or borrows from China and the other hard working countries that actually have a positive cash flow.\n \n \n \n\n 5) Carbon tax. Tax atmospheric carbon and rebate the revenue in the form of lower incentive-distorting taxation (like the payroll tax).\nAl Gore would become richer by the minute selling his phony Carbon Credits that do absolutely nothing toward reducing carbon emissions.

Is there anything intrinsically valuable about this principle? Isn't the goal good outcomes? And if we'd get better outcomes by restricting the franchise, isn't that something that would be worth implimenting?\n \n \nThe solution is to require that all voters be alive, that they be citizens of the district in which they vote, that they present a picture ID at the polls, that they get their finger dyed purple when they vote, that absentee ballots be counted only if there are enough of them to swing the election one way or the other AND that the votes are counted by a machine. Additionally, no candidate should be allowed to buy an election like our latest Messiah Obama did. All candidates should be restricted to public funding with NO contributions coming from people that expect to be paid back.\n\n \n The assumptions that campaign spending significantly affects electoral outcomes and that doners are \"paid back\" once the candidate is in office are both dubious, IMHO.\n \n \nFirst, you can&#8217;t call it an auction with only one buyer.\n\n \n I never said the government would be the only party bidding. \n \n It could easily be structured as follows: a drug company, say, would decide to apply the mechanism. Bids from other companies would be solicited in auction. To avoid collusion and to get participants to reveal their true valuation, a small portion of the winning bids are handed over to those parties. The other times, the government offers to buy it at bid plus a mark-up. It is then put into the public domain.\n \n \nSecond, the only money the government has to spend is that which it steals from you or borrows from China and the other hard working countries that actually have a positive cash flow.\n\n \n The fact that they would be purchased with government revenue is irrelevant from an efficency standpoint. Eliminating the deadweight loss from monopoly and increasing research incentives \"pays back\" the taxpayer plus some.\n \n \nAl Gore would become richer by the minute selling his phony Carbon Credits that do absolutely nothing toward reducing carbon emissions. (It&#8217;s okay to pollute if you pay for it.)\n\n \n Lucky for me, I didn't say anything about Al Gore or carbon credits.\n \n emoticon_confused",

You quote my words again, where I repeat the criticism for like the 40th time, and still, there is no response to it.\n \n Instead, there is a strawman about organ markets \"not attracting criminal activity.\" What did I actually say, gansao? What I actually said is that the incentive to illegally harvest organs would decline, reducing criminal trade relative to the status quo ante. This competely defeats your argument, which I suppose is the reason you continue to avoid it.\n \n But hey, you spent several posts defending an error in wording before conceding you'd made a mistake. How much longer would it take for you to realize you've messed up something that much more complex?\n \n \n This is your problem. You lose the general argument so you try to win it back by crying strawman!\n If an open market in organs makes more organs available then it is obvious that the scale of criminal activity will increase unless the price is exceptionally low. \n So you trying to argue the whole principle on a a relatively small point only shows how desperate you are. you are avoiding the issue and at the same time crying that I am doing it..priceless",

I'm going to make it as absolutely simple as I can in hopes that this final time, you might be able to grasp it.\n \n You suggested that a market in organs would result in higher levels of criminal trade.\n \n Criminals trade in organs because they fetch high prices. That is, there is currently a black market in stolen organs and they fetch high prices now.\n \n Black market organs fetch high prices because of the law of supply; the lower the supply, the higher the price.\n \n A market in organs would increase supply.\n \n Because of the increased supply, prices would fall (see the aforementioned law of supply).\n \n Because prices would fall, criminals would be less inclined to trade in them.\n \n Because they would have less incentive to illegally harvest organs, an organ market is an improvement on the status quo ante. As an absolute minimum, it is at least no worse in this particular regard.\n \n Therefore, your argument is horseshit. QED.\n \n This is all very easy.

You can have that pristine donor laying on the cart with highly desired organs...but, unless they ARE harvested...by a facility to do so, they will go to waste regardless of consent status of the country.\n This is something you just won't get around. \n As such, situations like that (and more), that CAN be changed...lead to a smaller number of 'donors per million'.\n \n \nThat is absolutely not what i'm stating.

There is nothing implict in the idea of an organ market that requires they be floating around freely like hotdogs in your grocer's freezer.\n \n As the situation currently stands, a reputable doctor at a reputable hospital removes an organ and transplants it into another person, or, one doctor removes the organ and hands it off to a second. Though i'm not aware of it, there may also exist explicit regulations designed to keep illict organs from transplantation. Do you agree that these practices effectively prohibit, so far as possible, transplanatation of illegally harvested organs? If so, why on earth could the same mechanisms not exist under an organ market? \n \n You might say, \"well, they could just circumvent these mechanisms.\" But of course, people can do that now.
