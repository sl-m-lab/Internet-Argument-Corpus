Anyway, creation[ism] doesn't blindly ignore the laws of physics. Anything about science that creationism ignores is done so intentionally. Mostly creationism selects and interprets the data (they even state that they are interpreting the data differently in light of revealed scripture) so that it will fit the proposed creationist scenario. Data that doesn't fit is ignored completely or is interpreted in such a way as to make it seem ridiculous. Generally, creationism interprets each bit of data in isolation, none having any effect on any other. Of course, in science, the fact that physics supports geology (and vice versa), and that they both support and are supported by biology adds to the strength of science.\n \nMore about this in my \"Differences of science and religion\" thread.\nBeen there, done that.",

   "The leading theory as to how the Earth got such a large moon, being a smallish (albeit the largest) rocky planet in the inner solar system is that a Mars-sized planet shared much of the orbit of the early pre-Earth at a LaGrange point. Eventually this unstable orbit decayed and the Mars-sized planet and the pre-Earth collided. For lack of a better term, they melted together and spewed a lot of ejecta into the orbit of the newly formed larger planet. This ejecta coalesced over time into the Moon. At that time, it is estimated that the Moon was much closer the the Earth, so that an earthbound observer would see it rotating, it would have been larger than the sun in the sky, and the day on Earth was a mere 14 hours or so. Over time, the Moon is moving away from the Earth, and this is measured with lasers. One day it will be smaller than the sun in the sky. Right now, it's pretty much exactly the same size as the sun in the sky. There's another cosmic coincidence. The time in geologic history that the Moon is the exact size of the sun in the sky is the same time that there is an species on the Earth intelligent enough to apprectiate the aesthetics of such a conjunction. \n \n When I first read \"what about the moon,\" I thought there would be a discussion of the stabilization of Earth's rotation given by the Moon, or maybe talk about the tides that may have had something to do with life (or not). Supposedly, without the Moon, the Earth would precess a bit more wildly on its axis. This would result in more dramatic temperature and climate changes in relatively short spans of time that would make life a bit more difficult to come by (supposedly, or any life that survived would be quite rugged indeed).\n \n Talking about \"Privileged Planets\" and special circumstances surrounding life as being indicators of a supreme intelligence is much like a lottery winner claiming that, since he has won the lottery, he could not have done so by mere chance.",
