   "Economists use various indexes to measure the health of the economy. But things like the Dow Jones and GDP don't really give us a clear picture of the economy. The Dow can go through the roof, but if business profits are sluggish are the companies in the Dow really worth what the Dow says they are? And 4% GDP growth from one quarter to next when the GDP for the last quarter was $1 is not nearly as good as 4% growth when the last quarter's GDP started out at $10. And no amount of GDP growth is good if most of it comes from spending borrowed money.\n \n So, what factors should be taken into consideration if you wanted to create a single index to measure economic health? I am aiming for a single arithmetic calculation that would give a single number that would indicate economic health.\n \n Some of the things I would include are:\n \n A. Number of employed people. (Maybe broken down by sector- an assembly line worker at GM is better than a burger flipper at McDonalds?)\n \n B. Number of BTUs of fossil fuel energy consumed. You could also consider the amount of other natural resources- iron, copper, water etcetera- that are consumed.\n \n C. Per capita value of retail sales.\n \n D. Per capita value of public and private debt.\n \n E. Per capita monetary income.\n \n However, I don't know what the formula for the calculation should look like. Some things are obviously good for the economy so you'd want a high number while others are bad so you'd want a small number. Some, like employment, could go either way.",

   "Flaja, I just look at two figures for comparison purposes; the GDP per capita and the median wage. If they're good, we're all good; if they're bad we're in trouble.\n \n I'm 74 years old. Within my life thus far there's never been a decade, year or quarterly period when a higher USA median wage weren't accompanied by better earnings and prices in most other industries; all boats were lifted by the same good tides.\n \n Too often our nation has experienced other higher financial indicators not accompanied by a higher USA median wage. My recollections are in each of such cases the higher indicators such as the Dow Jones or the S&P indicators proved to be unsustainable and they did not indicate an improved economy.\n \n I hope all the group's members are enjoying a happy holiday season and next year will be much better for our nation's and the remainder of the world's populations.\n \n Respectfully, Supposn",
