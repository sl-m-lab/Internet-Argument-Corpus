   "Is it just me, or do the Democrats' hopes of winning in November seem like they are shrinking every second?\n \n With two important swing states being ignored, the primaries potentially coming down to super delegates, and the fact that a couple of the likely nominee's most prominent supporters are anti-American bigots, it looks like four more years of the GOP. \n \n And let's look at the actual issues: The majority of Americans think that the surge is working (even though it isn't), the Dems are clueless when it comes to the economy, they don't have the greatest history of limiting government spending, none of them is really going to change NAFTA, the border won't be secured, and, lastly, what percentage of Americans really thinks that we should have universal healthcare?\n \n The only things the Dems have going for them that most Americans care about are global warming and the fact that we've been living with a monkey as president for the past eight years.\n \n Right now it looks like 2008 will go like 2004 and 2000 for the Democrats: snatching defeat from the hands of victory.",
