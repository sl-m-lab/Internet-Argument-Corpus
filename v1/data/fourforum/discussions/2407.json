Our government polishes economic numbers for the purpose of political enhancement, not assessment of conditions with a goal of improvement. A couple of popular numbers for US Public consumption are unemployed and new jobs created. This is accomplished by each state reporting the following:\n \n 1. number of persons collecting unemployment benefits\n \n 2. number of new jobs (people taking new positions must be reported by employers to the state within 20 days, this is sponsored by what's called the federal deadbeat dad law, used to enforce child support payments) \n \n Not included in the published calculations \n \n 1, What happens to the people who exhaust unemployment benefits, effectively reducing published unemployment numbers. Found employment? Welfare? Federal unemployment benefit extensions have been used since 9/11 to provide a financial cushion for the unemployed. This month our administration dominated congress voted to eliminate the extensions, which will show a reduction of the unemployed number for political purposes. \n \n 2. Types of new jobs, downgrades from industrial to service level, number of unemployed finding new jobs and being true reductions in the unemployed number, new jobs created by increased manufacturing (only rose .08% in a period where job growth was 2.9%) or percentage between public sector (rapidly expanding) and private sector jobs. \n \n The primary purposes of US Government economic reporting is to sooth the public for political purposes and assure those foreign investors in our treasury issues (45%) that our economy is improving and our enormous deficits in no way threaten our financial well-being.
