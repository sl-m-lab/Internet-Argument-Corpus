   "The Book of Jim\n \n Table of Contents\n \n Introduction.................................................................................................i\n \n Chapter 1 In the Beginning..........................................1\n Chapter 2 In the End......................................................2\n \n Introduction\n \n I'm God and you're not!\n \n Amazing as it may seem to you, I really did make all of the stuff around you...all of it! I did it in a way that a scant few people understand, even after thousands of years of pondering. I've listened to the arguments put forth in favor of the many postulates that have emerged since you humans began to wonder where life as it is came from. Though I knew from the very beginning that it would be entertaining to watch you struggle with such thoughts, there was no malice involved in my scheme.\n \n Chapter 1 In the Beginning\n \n Of course, I have always existed as I am without the constraint of time. After all, I am God. I existed as a singularity in my present form and with all my various powers. Time did not exist until I decided to make it happen. I decided to create time, space and matter out of nothing so that I would have some things to amuse me. I am, by the way, a narcissist. It's ALL about me and what I have created for your living enjoyment.\n \n Knowing that you would, in the course of your development, begin to wonder from whence cometh all things, I refrained from explaining the origins until you progressed from being merely another mammal in my collage to a state of advanced reasoning and wonderment. You would not have understood the truth several thousands of your years ago even had I hand painted pictures for you. Though you may be ready for some of the truth at this time, there will be many generations between you and the chosen few to which I will expose ALL of the truth...immediately prior to your sun becoming a nova, after which you will have no need of knowledge.\n \n I've been quite amused at the various things mankind has come to worship since I placed it among the other living things. I must say, you've managed to cover all the bases. Just as you were incapable of understanding the time span required to assemble the present state of all things, many of you will not understand why I do not insist that you worship me, after all these centuries of letting you think I cared.\n \n Some, not many of you have been right on track in your approach to the path to truth. You have not however, come near the path yet. After reaching the path you will still have a few centuries to follow it, should you be sufficiently auto-initiated and able to do so. I'll not prod you. You have reached the present without my interference as you were given free will rather than a programmed existence. You'll not be made aware when you have reached the path except in your perception that the pace has quickened substantially in that more and more of you will be wondering about and seeking the truth rather than wandering through the unenlightening, self-destructive habits you now possess. In other words, all of your churches will grow exponentially. Those who are churchless will wonder why. Churches will begin to grow faster than your population. An unquenchable thirst will drive you.\n \n I did not cause you to kill each other. You do that of your own free will. I did not cause you to love each other. You do that of your own free will. I did cause your physical attributes and ability to reason. These are the keys to your dominion over all other life on Earth. You have managed to invent overpowering weapons to kill not only yourselves but all forms of life. You have poisoned vast areas of your own environment with chemicals you either invented or discovered to have catastrophic effects on certain living things. You have altered the food chain to the extent that whole species are extinct. You have slaughtered each other...in my name for God's sake...more barbarously than do you the cattle, swine and fowl I gave you for such purposes. You have contaminated life itself. If I could express pity toward any living thing, it would be you. You are pitiful.\n \n After billions of years, your have failed to progress much beyond animalism. Pay attention to my animals. They kill and eat other species. They were designed to feed each other. With exception of some that attack and kill others of their own species, you are singly responsible for this thing you call murder. You have at least advanced beyond rampant cannibalism, but continue to kill each other under the influence of other stimuli. Much of your animosity stems from fear of the future, something that the animals do not share with you. Pay attention to my animals.\n \n Your attachment to the past is also responsible for much of the hatred amongst you. Fear of the future; obsession with the past: a deadly combination indeed.\n \n Study the past but do not anger yourselves regarding what you wrote...in my name for God's sake...should you discover, as you are doing as you read this, that some of your beliefs regarding how you got here turn out to be wrong. Some of them have been quite amusing now and then, but I'll not show favorites here by revealing which are true and which are not. Believe as you will...it won't change the past.\n \n Chapter 2 In the End\n \n It can, however, affect the future. You will discover after you find the path to truth that the killing going on around you is of your own creation and should never have been considered godly. As you traverse the path you will discover that in the long run...nothing matters. You will learn more in the last period than you can presently imagine. You will destroy all weapons and exist in bliss 'til the end. After that...you're toast, bro!",
