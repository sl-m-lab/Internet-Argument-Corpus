   "The OP asks when life begins. Something living/alive has life. \n\n \n Let me explain it to you further. There are unicellular organisms and there are multicellular organisms. In a unicellular organism (a bacterial cell, e.g.) the living cell and the life of the bacteria are indistinguishable from one another. There is only one cell and is therefore both a 'living' cell and the life of a bacteria. \n \n Multicellular organisms are more complex, comprised of multiple cells (anywhere from a few to several trillion). Thus, the cell is considered living but is separate from the life of the organism. Because a multicellular organism is not dependant on one cell for it's life, rather the combination of all its cells, then the living cell and the life of the organism are distinguished from one another. \n \n A human sperm cell does not make a human life (even though it is a living cell) because a) it doesn't meet the scientific requirements of what is considered life and b) the sperm cell in and of itself, cannot reproduce into a living human being nor can it grow into a living human being. It's only when the sperm and the egg meet that allows this new cell to grow and develop into a human being that is capable of reproduction, hence at fertilization it has now met the requirements of the scientific/medical definition of \"life\". \n \n Because it is human (that being the only thing it possibly could be due to its unique DNA) makes it a human life. \n \n \nThat wasn't the question and neither can a zygote be construed as a \"human being\" IMO. \n\n \n Well you're certainly entitled to your opinion... even at the blatant disregard for scientific fact. \n \n \nThis is what is known as a \"just so\" statement. You can't defend your position by simply restating it.\n\n \n It was a reiteration of my statement/position which apparently went right by you. I presented the facts throughout the entire post. It's up to you whether you want to believe and accept it. \n \n \nSo far we appear in agreement that a thing can be composed of living cells with human DNA and not be a \"human being\" aka \"person\".\n\n \n Yes, we are in agreement at that. Just as I mentioned before, skin cells, brain cells... every cell in your body is living and contains your DNA. And only your DNA. \n \n It is only when the DNA from a male and a female combine that makes it a new separate and distinct life, person or human being... whichever you prefer. They're all the same to me. That combination of the DNA happens at fertilization (aka conception).",

SUBJECTIVE. \n \n But once again, that's getting completely off topic of the original question \"When does life begin?\" not \"when does a 'person' become a 'person' and what are the woman's rights?\". \n \n \nAs someone else mentioned, the circle of life never really ends. Life doesn't 'begin' at conception. That was the point of the twin thing. When does the twin's life start? That zygote is identical to the one of a single child.

Thanks for that, Elton John. However, if you follow that concept through to its full conclusion then a living human being is a person. If they procreate, they've then created a person. Since life is a perpetual \"circle\" then personhood has never been lost from the very first person until now, including every child in the womb. That is, if you follow that theory to its logical conclusion. Personhood would only be transferred without loss to a new life. \n \n Again, regarding twinning and chimerism... You're ignoring the fact that life had to exist in order for a twin or chimera to form. So whether you want to call it one and then later two (for twins) or two and then later one (for chimerism) is really a moot point. it has no relevance on when life begins, only the philosophical debate over personhood. And again, according to your theory of the \"circle of life\", it wouldn't matter anyway since life is a perpetual circle and personhood is merely transferred and not lost. Either way, the argument holds no water. \n \n \nThe sperm and egg are both alive well before conception. Both are indeed 'human' in nature. I know, I know... 'but the egg needs fertilized.' But the zygote/embryo/fetus also needs a lot more to become a human. It needs to feed off the mother... That's just as much a part of creating a human as conception is.

That's all a zygote/embryo is--a potential human. It still needs a lot more to become a human, just like an egg needs a lot more, or a sperm needs a lot more. It really is a lot like the seed/tree argument. Destroying or digging up a seed is not the same as cutting down a tree.\n\n \n Perhaps you're missing the key component about sperm and egg begin 'alive' but not human life. The sperm and egg or no more human life than any other individual cell within the human body that contains ONLY the one person's DNA. \n \n Reproduction is only possible in humans with two distinctly different sets of chromosomes...23 from the male and 23 from the female. And at that point of fertilization when those chromosomes combine, it becomes a separate and distinct individual human life that is no longer just the living cell of a human but the very unique (and measurably so through DNA analysis) human life. It is now separate from both its mother and father but shares some genotypes and phenotypes of both. \n \n Is it beyond you that a separate and distinct individual cannot come into being if the egg is not first fertilized by the sperm of a different human being? Hence, the beginning of life occurs at conception. \n \n You had it right when you said a sperm (or an egg for that matter) is a \"potential human being\". That is when there is a potential for that sperm or egg cell to unite and become an \"actual human being\". Once that happens, there's no doubt scientifically that it is now a totally new separate and distinct human life. \n \n The child in the womb does need nourishment from the mother. That is a fact. The scientific definition of life does not mean that it has to provide its own nourishment. In fact, there is no living human being that doesn't get its nourishment from somewhere else. A newborn is no less dependent on the mother for all its needs than a child in utero. The only difference is that one is out of the womb while the other is still in it. Both are completely and utterly dependent upon another human being (for some time) to continue to live. Why else would women have the capacity to lactate if not for the specific and solitary purpose of providing the child with nourishment, just like the umbilical cord's purpose. Again, complete independence from another living thing is not a requirement for the scientific definition of life. \n \n There is nothing more that a fetus/embryo/zygote/child in utero needs to become a human life, it already is a human life. It needs to continually exhibit all the defining characteristics of life to continue to be a human being (as we all do, no matter what stage in life we're in from the child in utero all the way to the elderly). \n \n \nAnyway, I know I'm just rambling, so I'll stop.\n\n \n Thank you.",

Now if you're referring to consciousness or life in the physical/scientific sense then yes, you absolutely can measure it. \n \n If you're talking in the metaphyscial sense, then you're right, you can't measure it. You can't prove it. I'm not even sure what solid empirical evidence you could even amass for it. \n \n What you call evidence to debate philosophical concepts is the same as me \"witnessing\" or providing \"testimony\" to why I believe God exists. I still can't prove it and my evidence probably isn't going to be received by someone who doesn't believe in the existence of God. Again, all subjective. \n \n And again, taking the subjectivity out of the argument since neither side can definitively prove, disprove or even provide substantial empirical evidence that supports one position or another, we have to fall back on what CAN definitively be proven. And in the case of when life begins, it can and has been definitively proven by science to begin at conception. \n \n \nIn the same way, we create a definition for 'personhood' and then decide if our target conforms to our definition. It's logic and reasoning.\n\n \n It's nothing the same. There was ACTUAL evidence to conclude definitively within the scientific community the definition of life. Does anyone dispute that definition? And how did they arrive at that conclusion? By observing and measuring the world around them. Apparently they were able to measure and observe certain characteristics of things around them to conclude a single, uncontested definition of what is living and what is not... or to even arrive at a conclusion for that matter. \n \n Are you saying that YOU of all people are disputing the scientific definition of life?

After all, they are separate and distinct stages of the cycle of life (not to be confused with Elton John and Stonewall's \"circle of life\"). But for the sake of argument, life ends when all characteristics of life cease to be met.

If I was really wanting to reference Elton, I would have picked a better song.\n \n \nAgain, regarding twinning and chimerism... You're ignoring the fact that life had to exist in order for a twin or chimera to form. So whether you want to call it one and then later two (for twins) or two and then later one (for chimerism) is really a moot point. it has no relevance on when life begins, only the philosophical debate over personhood. And again, according to your theory of the \"circle of life\", it wouldn't matter anyway since life is a perpetual circle and personhood is merely transferred and not lost. Either way, the argument holds no water.\n \n \n I'm not ignoring anything. Just because the zygote must be alive doesn't make it a person.\n \n \nPerhaps you're missing the key component about sperm and egg begin 'alive' but not human life. The sperm and egg or no more human life than any other individual cell within the human body that contains ONLY the one person's DNA. \n \n Reproduction is only possible in humans with two distinctly different sets of chromosomes...23 from the male and 23 from the female. And at that point of fertilization when those chromosomes combine, it becomes a separate and distinct individual human life that is no longer just the living cell of a human but the very unique (and measurably so through DNA analysis) human life. It is now separate from both its mother and father but shares some genotypes and phenotypes of both. \n\n \n Sperm certainly are human life, just not human beings. \n \n My hair, along with every other cell in my body, also has 46 chromosomes, just like the zygote. Having DNA does not a person make. I get the point that it is different than a sperm or egg, and that it is a unique organism, but again, that doesn't make it a person. And if it isn't a person yet, it isn't relevant.\n \n \nIs it beyond you that a separate and distinct individual cannot come into being if the egg is not first fertilized by the sperm of a different human being? Hence, the beginning of life occurs at conception. \n\n \n Also can't happen until the sperm or egg are created. Or until the parents have sex. The life of the components are already alive before conception. But yeah, when the zygote is created, it is definitely the beginning of that zygote's life. \n \n \nYou had it right when you said a sperm (or an egg for that matter) is a \"potential human being\". That is when there is a potential for that sperm or egg cell to unite and become an \"actual human being\". Once that happens, there's no doubt scientifically that it is now a totally new separate and distinct human life. \n\n \n A totally new, separate, and distinct human zygote, yes. A human being, no.\n \n \nThe child in the womb does need nourishment from the mother. That is a fact. The scientific definition of life does not mean that it has to provide its own nourishment. In fact, there is no living human being that doesn't get its nourishment from somewhere else. A newborn is no less dependent on the mother for all its needs than a child in utero. The only difference is that one is out of the womb while the other is still in it. Both are completely and utterly dependent upon another human being (for some time) to continue to live. Why else would women have the capacity to lactate if not for the specific and solitary purpose of providing the child with nourishment, just like the umbilical cord's purpose. Again, complete independence from another living thing is not a requirement for the scientific definition of life. \n\n \n I never said anybody was truly independent, and I never said personal independence was a requirement for personhood. I was simply stating that it has to stay inside the mother and feed in order to develop from a cell to a human being. Although I didn't mention it there, though, I would argue that to be considered a person, the organism would have to be able to survive outside the mother's body, though.\n \n \nThere is nothing more that a fetus/embryo/zygote/child in utero needs to become a human life, it already is a human life. It needs to continually exhibit all the defining characteristics of life to continue to be a human being (as we all do, no matter what stage in life we're in from the child in utero all the way to the elderly). \n \n \n Thank you.\n\n \n Yeah, all it needs is time, the right environment, and the right nutrients. Same as a plant seed. The part I bolded confuses me a bit as to what you mean. Are you conceding that a zygote isn't yet a human being, or are you using the terms 'human life' and 'human beings' interchangeably. If that's the case, what human being characteristics (personhood traits) does the zygote exhibit? There's no brain, limbs, organs...",

Only if it is in the womb and nourished for a long period of time does it turn into a human. And as Sigma stated, 1/3 of the time an egg is fertilized, nature permorms its own abortion... I'm glad you have admitted that a zygote isn't a human being yet, though.\n \n As for the bible verse, thanks. It confirms that even the God of the bible doesn't consider a fetus a human being. The punishment for murder is death. The punishment for causing a miscarriage against a woman's will is to pay a fine (that the husband determines). Of course an abortion against a woman's will would be horrible. You can easily see, however, that if the husband and wife decided to have an abortion, the husband would not demand the doctor pay a fine at all. \n \n I'm curious why you would bring up a bible verse that doesn't support your position at all... Again, it clearly states that an unwanted miscarriage is punishable by a fine as the husband sees fit, but if the woman is also hurt or killed, then it is a life for a life.",
