That's where the danger lies.\"\n \n The Council, based in the eastern French city of Strasbourg, oversees human rights standards in member states and enforces decisions of the European Court of Human Rights.\n \n If passed, the resolution would not be binding on its 47 member states but would reflect widespread opposition among politicians to teaching creationism in science class.\n \n NATURAL SELECTION DROPPED\n \n Creationism says God made the world in six days as depicted in the Bible. Intelligent design argues some life forms are too complex to have evolved according to Charles Darwin's theory and needed an unnamed higher intelligence to develop as they have.\n \n Some conservatives in the United States, both religious and secular, have long opposed the teaching of evolution in public schools but U.S. courts have regularly barred them from teaching what they describe as religious views of creation.\n \n Pressure to teach creationism is weaker in Europe, but has been mounting. An Assembly committee took up the issue because a shadowy Turkish Muslim publishing group has been sending an Islamic creationist book to schools in several countries.\n \n Supporters of intelligent design want it taught in science class alongside evolution. A U.S. court ruled this out in a landmark decision in 2005, dismissing it as \"neo-creationism.\"\n \n \"The aim of this report is not to question or to fight a belief,\" Brasseur wrote in a memorandum added to the new resolution. \"It is not a matter of opposing belief and science, but it is necessary to prevent belief from opposing science.\"\n \n She said the resolution also shortened references in the resolution to \"evolution by natural selection\" to \"evolution\" because some members had misunderstood the reference to natural selection to be an attack on their religious beliefs.",

The word is from the old English synn, presumed to be from Germanic *sun(d)j&#333; (lit: \"it is true\"). It is recorded in use as early as the 9th century. The most common formal definition is an infraction against religious or moral law. ...\n en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin\n \n * A Social Insurance Number (SIN) is a number issued in Canada to administer various government programs. The SIN was created in 1964 to serve as a client account number in the administration of the Canada Pension Plan and Canada's varied employment insurance programs. In 1967, Revenue Canada (now the Canada Revenue Agency) started using the SIN for tax reporting purposes. SINs are issued by Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (previously Human Resources Development Canada).\n en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIN\n \n * Sin was a PPV in World Championship Wrestling held in January 2001. It was near the end of WCW as the company folded in March.\n en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin_(WCW)\n \n * Sin was the name of the lunar god in Babylonia and Assyria. He was also known as Nanna, the \"illuminer.\"\n en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin_(god)\n \n * Sin is the mighty beast and main antagonist in the video game Final Fantasy X (2001).\n en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin_(Final_Fantasy)\n \n * Sin is a computer game developed by Ritual Entertainment and published by Activision in 1998. Sin is a shooter based on a modified version of the Quake II engine; but because it involves more plot-driven gameplay than most first person shooters and what Ritual describes as \"action-based outcomes,\" it could almost be considered an adventure game. The plot element of the game and its consequent replayability are among its most distinguishing (and advertised) characteristics.\n en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin_(computer_game)\n \n * Sin (also known as Halo 4) is a single by Nine Inch Nails for the song of the same name released in 1990.\n en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin_(Nine_Inch_Nails)\n \n * The primary Greek word rendered \"sin\" is \"hamartia\". This word essentially means \"missing the mark; falling short; or a departure\". The essential idea being conveyed by the use of this word is that of \"a departure from holiness\"; thus \"hamartia\" means to sin; to depart from God's standard of holiness; to become unrighteous; to fail to live up to what God requires of us.

Because God has said not to lie (Exodus 20:16). If you do what God has forbidden, then you have sinned. In addition, if you do not do what God has commanded, you sin (James 4:17). Either way, the result is eternal separation from God (Isaiah 59:2). Sin is lawlessness (1 John 1:3) and unrighteousness (1 John 5:17). Sin leads to bondage (Rom. 6:14-20) and death (Rom. 6:23). ...\n www.carm.org/dictionary/dic_s.htm\n \n * The breaking of one of the Ten Commandments of the Old Testament of the Bible, but later included any non-adherence to the teachings of the Christian Churches. (What was a sin for one was not, necessarily, a sin for the other.)\n www.saburchill.com/history/hist003.html\n \n * In the Bible, the Hebrew and Greek words which are translated as sin mean failing to hit the target or missing the mark. Most conservative Christians believe that, since God is pure and just, that a person who sins just once cannot come into God's presence unless they first attain salvation.\n www.religioustolerance.org/gl_s1.htm\n \n * In theological terms sin is the darkening of the nous. When the nous goes away from the heart and ceases having remembrance of God and is distracted to creation through the senses, then it commits sin. This distraction is manifested in actions which are, thus, called sin. Sin starts with assent and evolves to desire, action and passion.\n www.pelagia.org/htm/b01.en.a_night_in_the_desert_of_the_holy_mountain.09.htm\n \n * The world defines sin as a transgression of a religious or moral law, a deliberate disobedience to the known Will of God, a condition of estrangement from God resulting from such disobedience, or something regarded as shameful, deplorable, or utterly wrong. We define a sin is any word, emotion, thought or act that can separate Mind, Power and Substance.

   "I deny that. It's mostly a religious connotation. Atheists can't \"sin\", they can only break the law or transgress moral codes.\n \n \n \n Well, you know if you want to twist the meaning of a word, you can define it any way you please. It's novel to me to propose a definition of sin that is anything other religious. I can't force you to abide by common usage, though.\n \n I'll just leave you with these definitions I found on the Web:\n \n http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=sin\n \n Noun\n [*]sin, sinfulness, wickedness (estrangement from god)[*] sin, sinning (an act that is regarded by theologians as a transgression of God's will)[*]sine, sin (ratio of the length of the side opposite the given angle to the length of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle)[*]Sin ((Akkadian) god of the Moon; counterpart of Sumerian Nanna)[*]sin (the 21st letter of the Hebrew alphabet)[*]sin, hell (violent and excited activity) \"they began to fight like sin\"\n Verb\n [*]sin, transgress, trespass (commit a sin; violate a law of God or a moral law)[*]drop the ball, sin, blunder, boob, goof (commit a faux pas or a fault or make a serious mistake) \"I blundered during the job interview\"\n True, there are a couple of non-religious definitions in there. But if I exceed the speed limit, I am NOT \"sinning\", I am breaking a traffic law.\n\n \n Based on your reply then it is agreed that sin is not necessarily a religious transgression.",

The other time, usually, they are referring to the ratio of the side opposite an angle to the hypotenuse of a right angled triangle. All the remaining uses are jocular.",
