   "How is that game anyway? Its supposed to be amazing. Better than Call to Duty?\n\n \n I never actually played COD. But apparently COD has a lot of bad information about WWII, such as the inability to mini load a Garand Rifle. That's wrong, you can do it, it's just stupid. \n \n the game is authentic in that normandy is actually recreated, building by building. It's so insane that they have pictures of what it looked like in 1944 and what it looks like in the game. it's like the litterally copied the picture. One image has the black and white merging into the game. I'm defintetly impressed. The weapons, for the most part are authentic. They replicated a number of actual events, such as Col. Cole's charge on the outskirtes of Caretan. That mission was insane. Almost got killed 5 times alone in that one charge. \n \n The squad control is amazingly simple. Merely hold down the right mouse button, put it where you want then to go, and they go, firing and ducking as they run. you gain respect for weapons and what soldieres today have to go through. I now know the real threat of a random mortar. And Mg42s (machine guns) really scare the **** out of me. On emission I was pinned by two machine guns. Yes, there is a melee attack. Instant kill. The graphics are awesome. I'm running a ATI 9550 256 meg video card though and a gig of ram. \n \n A few bad things, you can't drive vehicles, but then again, you are a paratrooper with no armor training. No prone position. Killing tanks on foot is frightening. It gets a bit repetative at times. Suppress, snipe, flank repeat. Oh yeah, the cover is really screwed up. A mg42 will fire through a hedge but in the game it doesn't. A BAR will fire through hay. But in the game it doesn't. \n \n the humor provided by two of your squad members is hysterical. Allan and Garnett are my favorite characters. \n \n I paid $35 from Amazon instead of the normal $50.. But make sure you have a dvd drive or the game won't install.",

   "I'll check it out, probably buy it used.\n \n But, what the hell? No prone? Ouch.\n\n \n That would be a real problem if cover was hard to find, but the amount of cover in the game is ridiculous. There's only been 2 times in 18 chapters where I couldn't find decent cover, one being col. Cole's charge into Caretan (that's a reason why it's insane), and it's not that big of a deal when you can get your fire team to suppress the Krauts so they aren't opening up on you while you sneak up on them and gun them down with a tompson machine gun or a mp40. \n \n There's a few fun things. I picked up a german anti-tank weapon and lobbed it at a machine gun nest. lol. Take that you Nazi XXXXX. Panzerfaust up the butt!",
