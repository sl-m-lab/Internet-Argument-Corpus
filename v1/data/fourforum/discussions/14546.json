First of all, Kellermann's own data show that owning a security system, or renting a home rather than owning it, are also associated with equally large increased risks of death. Yet newspapers did not start running dire stories warning people to rip out their burglar alarms or to start lobbying their condo association to dissolve. The 2.7 factoid also overlooks the obvious fact that one reason people choose to own guns, or to install burglar alarms, is that they are already at higher risk of being victimized by crime. As Yale law professor John Lott points out, Kellermann's methodology is like comparing 100 people who went to a hospital in a given year with 100 similar people who did not, finding that more of the hospital patients died, and then announcing that hospitals increase the risk of death. Kellermann's method would also prove that possession of insulin increases the risk of diabetes. \n\n \n Guncite also tears this apart as well. \n   Gun Ownership as a Risk Factor for Homicide in the Home \n \n Here is what we know, despite Kellerman's Anti-gun claims.\n  Study done by the University of Tennessee Med school \nLooking only to official criminal records, data over the past thirty years consistently show that the mythology of murderers as ordinary citizens does not hold true. Studies have found that approximately 75% of murderers have adult criminal records, and that murderers average a prior adult criminal career of six years, including four major adult felony arrests.

The reason over half of those 25% of murderers don't have adult records is that they are juveniles. Thus, by definition they cannot have an adult criminal record. Juvenile criminal records might well show these murderers to have extensive serious criminal records. \n\n \n \n \n   Violence in America - Effective Solutions \n more than two-thirds of gun homicide \"victims\" are involved with drug trafficking or have evidence of ante-mortem illicit drug use.\n \n Not only do the data show that acquaintance and domestic homicide are a minority of homicides,[26] but the FBI's definition of acquaintance and domestic homicide requires only that the murderer knew or was related to the decedent.

The cart is following a Finnish regiment, and a flagpole flies the regimental flag. The scene begins with another business transaction between Mother Courage and the war. She is trying to haggle down an armorer over the price of a sack of shot. \"I'm not buying army goods,\" she says at the beginning of the scene, before adding, \"well, not at that price.\" She wins the bargaining and pays a florin and a half.\n \n This is one of the play's more domestic scenes. Swiss Cheese, dressed in a paymaster's uniform, has fallen (like his brother) into the employ of the war. We are introduced to Yvette Pottier, an alcoholic prostitute who is drinking brandy, having set aside her red high-heels, and who sings the \"Song of Fraternization\" to warn Kattrin about the danger of getting involved with men. The song describes the relationship between Yvette and \"Peter the Puff\" (named thus because he kept his pipe in his mouth during sex) some years earlier, which culminated in Yvette being left behind as the regiment marched on. The play will later reveal \"Peter the Puff\" to be none other than the General's Cook. Depressed at the close of her song, Yvette exits, leaving her prostitute's garb behind her.\n \n The Chaplain arrives with a message for Mother Courage from Eilif, and the Cook accompanies him (apparently to try his luck at a sexual relationship with Mother Courage). Mother Courage, the Cook and Chaplain discuss the politics of the war. The Kaiser is discussed in depth: he has followed his conscience but caused much bloodshed in doing what he believes is \"the right thing.\" Mother Courage closes the conversation with the central observation that, though the big shots claim to be waging war for \"Almighty God and all things bright and beautiful,\" they are actually \"out for all they can get.\" During their conversation, Kattrin tries on Yvette's boots and hat and struts around, imitating Yvette.\n \n There is a volley of gunfire, drumming, and explosions, and the armorer returns hurriedly to announce that the Catholics have taken over the regiment. A fast change of loyalty ensues with the Chaplain changing his robes and with Mother Courage changing the regimental flag, smearing Kattrin's face in ashes to make her less attractive to the invading soldiers. Swiss Cheese appears on the scene with the regimental cash box, and his mother is horrified to learn he wants to store it in her cart. The cannonfire intensifies, and there is a scene break.\n \n Three days later, Swiss Cheese laments the fact he has not been able to return the cash box to his sergeant. Mother Courage leaves with the Chaplain to purchase meat (feeding the war again) after discovering Yvette's red high-heeled boots in the cart--Kattrin has stolen them during the Catholic raid.\n \n While Swiss Cheese talks to Kattrin, a man with an eyepatch (a spy searching for Swiss Cheese) appears and asks her if she has seen anyone from the Second Finnish Regimental Headquarters. Swiss Cheese, having decided to find his regiment and return the cashbox, ignores Kattrin's desperate attempts to warn him about the spy, takes the box, and leaves the scene.\n \n As Mother Courage arrives back with the Chaplain, Swiss Cheese is dragged back on by two men and questioned about a sergeant--he hid the cashbox by the river, was followed, and was caught. His mother denies knowing him, and he is led off. There is another scene break.\n \n The Chaplain sings to Kattrin the \"song of the Hours,\" which outlines the Passion of Christ in brief quatrains. Yvette enters with an ancient colonel with whom she is sleeping. She haggles with Mother Courage about buying her cart. Mother Courage is forced to agree since she needs money to bribe the soldiers to spare Swiss Cheese's life. Yvette runs offstage to persuade the soldiers to take the bribe.\n \n Mother Courage intends to use the money from the cashbox to buy her cart back from Yvette once Swiss Cheese has returned. As her plan goes, Swiss Cheese will turn over the cashbox to her. Yet, when Yvette returns, it is to tell her that the soldiers will accept her two hundred florins as a bribe--but that Swiss Cheese, under torture, admitted to throwing the cashbox in the river. Mother Courage now has to choose between her business and her son.\n \n She tells Yvette to return offering one hundred twenty florins, so that she has some money left over with which to continue trading. The soldiers refuse, demanding the full two hundred and refusing to wait. Yvette runs back to offer the full amount, but it is too late. Drums are heard in the distance, and the stage lights darken. Swiss Cheese has been executed.\n \n The soldiers return with Swiss Cheese's body on a stretcher. To save herself and her daughter, Mother Courage again denies knowing him, shaking her head in silence. The sergeant commands his men to throw Swiss Cheese's corpse into the pit since \"there ain't nobody here who knows him.\"\n \n Analysis\n \n As well as being the longest scene, this is one of the key scenes in the play, deserving serious attention. It combines several of the play's key themes and is perhaps the easiest scene to analyze in terms of Brecht's use of dramatic symbolism.\n \n Family vs. business, an irresolvable conflict which is to cost Swiss Cheese his life at the end of the scene, expresses tensions from the start: Mother Courage's washing line is strung from a cannon, a visual symbol of the way Mother Courage's domestic and professional lives are always inextricably linked. Brecht's message is neatly underlined too in the way that Mother Courage attempts to \"mortgage,\" not \"sell,\" her cart to Yvette. But like her own involvement in the war, this bargain too must be an all-or-nothing deal. Even the cart itself, home and business, is caught somewhere between these two poles.\n \n Mother Courage's bargaining for Swiss Cheese's life was much edited by Brecht after the original premiere of the play in order to make Mother Courage seem less sympathetic. From the final text of the play, it is easy to condemn her for, as she herself puts it, \"bargaining too long\" and thereby bringing about her son's shooting. The paradox here is that Mother Courage herself will starve if she retains no means by which to live--the sale of her cart represents financial ruin for her. Though it is easy to refute, in retrospect, Mother Courage's decision to bargain, Brecht emphasizes that often, for the peasant classes, the choice is often between one dire circumstance and another.\n \n Mother Courage's bargaining highlights what Brecht said was the single most important lesson of the play as a whole: that little people cannot profit from a war which runs only for the profit of the greater authorities. Mother Courage here fails to realize that she will never be able to save Swiss Cheese and keep her cart. There is an opportunity cost either way. According to Brecht, Mother Courage's greatest failing is that although a capitalist, even at the end of the play she remains ignorant of this basic truth about capitalism. (See the section on \"Brecht's Intention.\")\n \n This scene is also fascinating in terms of its religious symbolism. As well as being the third scene in the play, occurring three years after the second scene, one of its central breaks is for three days. These recurring threes culminate in Mother Courage's denying knowing Swiss Cheese three times. And once we hear the Chaplain's \"Song of the Hours,\" it is hard for anyone with a good education to miss Brecht's comparison of Swiss Cheese's death with the Passion of Jesus. Yet the sergeant's final instruction, to \"throw Swiss Cheese in the pit,\" suggests that Swiss Cheese is no martyr who has died for a good cause. The comparison goes the other way: invoking the suffering and death of Jesus in this way sidelines, in the context of war, the role of religion. The Passion is likened to a minor military execution outside a tiny village--an insignificant act, achieving nothing.\n \n The rejection of a role for religious belief among wartime capitalists is explicit in the scene's action as well. The Chaplain's hypocrisy is clear as day in his bitter line, \"All good Catholics here,\" and it seems not to matter to Mother Courage which religion's flag she flies. The speed with which the Chaplain changes his robes when he learns the Catholics are attacking demonstrates that his religious principles are instantly superseded by his cowardice in the face of danger. At the same time, one might think that the differences between Protestants and Catholics are not so great after all, making it easier for people to switch allegiances for non-religious reasons. \"Bribery in humans is like mercy in God,\" says Mother Courage at one point, and the provocation of this comparison is only one of many points where Brecht forces us to question the value of religious faith in what is, after all, supposed to be a war of religion.\n \n One of Brecht's single most famous pieces of direction, the \"silent scream,\" was included in the first production at the very end of the scene after Swiss Cheese's body is carried away. Helene Weigel, playing Mother Courage, screamed silently. Brecht wrote, \"her look of extreme suffering after she has heard the shots, her unscreaming open mouth and backward-bent head probably derived from a press photograph of an Indian woman crouched over the dead body of her son during the shelling of Singapore.\" Its resonance has indeed proved powerfully timeless, and it is retained in many modern productions (including Stephen Unwin's 2006 ETT staging, which starred Diana Quick). Perhaps it is so powerful because, like Mother Courage herself at that moment, it is painfully ineffective yet intensely personal. A \"silent scream\" is a paradox understood best by the screamer.\n \n Kattrin's character comes into interesting focus within the spectrum of sexual undercurrents in the relationships in this scene. The Cook, by leaving his pipe (already noted as a sexual symbol by Yvette earlier) with Mother Courage, has thereby declared his sexual interest in her. Yet, though her mother remains sexually desirable, Kattrin's imitation of Yvette's gait and theft of her prostitute's boots is a telling representation of the way her mother represses Kattrin's own burgeoning sexuality. Kattrin's awakening desires in the scene will be another, more subtle, victim of the war.\n \n So never haggle with an alcoholic prostitute over a bag of shot.emoticon_rolleyes",

Give me a break. \n \n \nIn a critical and now classic review published in the March 1994 Journal of the Medical Association of Georgia (JMAG), Suter not only found evidence of \"methodologic and conceptual errors,\" such as prejudicially truncated data and non-sequitur logic, but also \"overt mendacity,\" including the listing of \"the correct methodology which was described but never used by the authors.\" Moreover, the gun-control researchers \"deceptively understated\" the protective benefits of guns.

In failing to account for this, the medical literature cannot and does not honestly assess these deaths.\"\n\n Nice try but as pointed out already, Kellermann's study took into account previous drug use and still found and independent relationship between gun ownership and the risk of homicide.",

   "=Galileo;409990]\"Kellermann chose to conduct this survey using the 'case-control method' (or CCM). This method examines the differences between two groups: one that possesses a certain trait, and another that does not. For instance, a researcher may compare a 'case group' that has lung cancer to a 'control group' that is free of the disease. After asking them questions about their behavior and environment, he may learn that the case group generally smokes, but the control group does not.\" \n \n In Kellermann's study, the case group consisted of 388 homicide victims. Each homicide victim was matched with a living person in the control group who was of the same \"age, race, sex and neighborhood\" as the victim. \n \n Gun ownership was more common among members of the case group (homicide victims) than members of the control group (living people). 45.4% of homicide victims had kept a gun in their homes compared to 35.8% in the control group. 26.7% of homicide victims had kept a loaded gun in their homes compared to only 12.5% in the control group. Some might falsely claim that the study did not measure the protective benefits of gun ownership. However:\n \n \"If firearms deter, scare away or wound intruders, then the murder victimization rate of gun owners should be lower than non-gun owners. The absence of a gun in the home would have been recognized as a murder risk, rather than the presence of a gun.\"\n \n If firearms do protect against crime then it would be logical that gun ownership among homicide victims would be lower rather than higher, but the study revealed that murder victims were actually more likely to have a gun in their homes than those who were not murdered. What's really interesting is that \"the victim's murderer was 21 times more likely to be a relative or acquaintance than a stranger.\" \n \n Isn't it ironic- you keep a gun in your home to protect against some random intruder but you end up being at a greater risk of being killed by a family member or acquaintance. \n A gun in the home\n\n \n What the antipodean won't tell you:\n \n Thesis:\n \n Is Kellerman 43 times more likely to lie? Is star gazer 43 times more likely to keep repeating the lies? They have been exposed repeatedly by actual criminologists and real doctors as well as our own congress.\n \n StateMaster - Encyclopedia: Arthur Kellermann\n \n \nCritics of Kellermann's 1993 paper responded with a large body of statistical analysis, some accurate (i.e. the study population was urban and therefore higher risk in general, compared to suburban or rural areas; that residents of homes where there is a risk of fatal domestic violence typically are more aware of the fact than external researchers), and some inaccurate (i.e. that members of rival gangs were tabulated as \"family member or intimate acquaintance\"; that the data was \"cherry-picked\"). Particular attention was paid to the fact that he did not \"release his data\" immediately upon publication, even though Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's grants do not require the individual investigator to make data public until there are no more publications to be developed from it. SUNY-Buffalo's Lawrence Southwick, among others, went as far as to publicly speculate \"that Kellermann's full data set would actually vindicate defensive gun ownership.\" [2] In 1997, Congress cut funding to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's injury prevention center by $2.6 million, the exact amount the CDC spent on the firearms research the previous year; the point was not lost on the CDC. Congress has also added language to every CDC budget since then prohibiting the agency from funding anything that might \"advocate or promote gun control.\" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia, is recognized as the leading United States agency for protecting the public health and safety of people. ... Lawrence Southwick (ca. ... 1997 (MCMXCVII) was a common year starting on Wednesday of the Gregorian calendar. ... \n \n Kellermann continues to be a lightning rod for those opposed to gun control, with large numbers of websites and Usenet postings repeating the attacks (both correct and incorrect) on his research, continuing to claim that he is still \"hiding\" his data, accusing him of fraud, and claiming that the study has been \"debunked\".\n\n \n (More)CDC funding cut after kellerman studies - Google Search\n \n \n]and had anti-gun Profs Philip Cook and Jens Ludwig run and study and write a report. The report is Guns in America: National Survey of Private Ownership and Use of Firearms. \n\n \n http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles/165476.pdf\n \n \n:\n The key explanation for the difference between the 108,000 NCVS estimate\n for the annual number of DGUs and the several million from the surveys\n discussed earlier is that NCVS avoids the false-positive problem by limiting\n DGU questions to persons who first reported that they were crime victims.\n Most NCVS respondents never have a chance to answer the DGU question,\n falsely or otherwise.\n \n \n Also, please note Exhibit 7, page 8.\n \n \n \n*DGU = Defensive gun use.\n\n \n Now let's see what Dr. Miguel Faria of Doctors for Integrity of Policy research says about Kelleman and people like him.\n \n The Perversion of Science and Medicine: Gun Control and Public Health\n \n \n]In the case of Dr. Kellermann, it was reported that during his formal presentation at the (October 17, 1993) HELP conference, in an emotional moment admitted his personal anti-gun bias (a bias that, as we have seen, is evident in the pattern of his research). [Slide 33] Although in a letter to the Journal of the Medical Association of Georgia, Kellermann denied making such a statement at that specific meeting, he did not actually repudiate his general anti-gun bias. Dr. Kellermann's elitism (and true appreciation of the value of a gun for self-protection), nevertheless, is well encapsulated in the following retort directed at a question by a reporter and quoted in the San Francisco Examiner (April 3, 1994): \"If that were my wife [being attacked], would I want her to have a .38 Special in her hand? 'Yeah,' says Dr. Kellermann.\"\n\n \n What honest doctors and criminologists are doing about it?\n \n \nWe testified about the misrepresentation of data, skewed study populations (as to selection and extrapolations), inappropriate research models for the subject under study, and arrival to preordained conclusions (i.e., results-oriented research) - all evident in the immensely shoddy \"gun (control) research\" conducted by the CDC/NCIPC. The panel was also informed about how the NCIPC researchers breach accepted scientific practice by refusing to release and make available to other researchers their publicly funded, original data for further critical analysis.\n \n We recommended that the committee eliminate all funding for the NCIPC for the fiscal year of 1997, and thereby realize a savings to taxpayers of nearly $50 million annually - and most importantly, effecting a major step forward, towards liberating science from the oppressing claws of politics.\n\n \n \n \n Conclusion\n \n \n \n Although we were not able to close the doors of the NCIPC, our efforts culminated in a significant defeat for the gun-prohibitionists in public health by the House of Representatives that July of 1996. The House voted to shift $2.6 million away from the NCIPC and earmarked the funds for other health research projects. The redirected funding was the amount formerly allocated by the NCIPC to their discredited \"gun (control) research.\" Dr. Kellermann's gun research was defunded by the CDC, and he is now conducting research on the benefits and need for motorcycle helmets.\n \n The successfully passed Dickey Amendment, which de-funded the NCIPC's anti-gun initiative, hopefully will effect a major step toward restoring integrity to public health and perhaps, returning it to its former traditional role of stamping out infectious diseases and epidemics. Although, the re-direction of $2.6 million away from NCIPC seems a modest attempt to restore the integrity of public health research, it also sends the greater symbolic message: [Slide 35] that citizens, including many scientists and physicians, are not going to sit idly by and allow the perversion of science and medical research for political ends.\n \n Nevertheless, the jury is still out. Whether this victory is fleeting and evanescent or definitive and long lasting is yet to be seen. I urge every one of you to remain informed and vigilant on this issue. As Thomas Jefferson once said: \"To compel a man to furnish funds for the propagation of ideas he disbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical.\"[/QUOTE]\n \n \n \n Thank you.\n \n \n \nDr. Faria is Editor emeritus of the Medical Sentinel and author of Vandals at the Gates of Medicine (1995), Medical Warrior: Fighting Corporate Socialized Medicine (1997), and Cuba in Revolutuion: Escape From a Lost Paradise (2002).\n \n Copyright\u00a91999-2003 Miguel A.

   "Kellerman Debunked!\n \n Kellerman used many statistical tricks such as limiting any defensive gun use to that where the trigger was actually pulled and excluding any gun use which ocurreding any gun use which ocurred outside the home (such as the front yard). Using multiple categories and then condensingg the data from there tended to obscure the more obvious factors such as, most suicides in his study did not use a gun. And he also refused to allow criminologists such as Kates and Kleck to examine his \"data.\" Too many to mention here. \n \n Despite the 1986 \"study\" being trashed by every major criminologist, the \"43 times\" soundbite that emerged lives on in news stories and HCI literature. The 1986 \"study\" is actually kind of boring and tacky when compared to Kellerman\"s 1993 NEJM submission Again, without a hint of peer-review (since the peers didn't get a chance to look at the data until May of 1997), Kellerman this time has not only one co-author, but nine!! Five MDs, three PhDs and one BA in total, not a recognizable name from the world of criminology among them. \n \n Oh, and Kellerman was now one of the major recipients of over two million in grants from the CDC. The CDC head that gave Kellerman the money and helped him hide his data from the probing eyes of scholarly criminologists, thus violating federal law, is now President Clinton's pick for Surgeon General. Anyway, the soundbite that comes from the 1993 \"study\"? \"A gun in the home is 2.7 times...\" \n \n On purpose. Kellerman\"s first \"mistake\" is building his is building his paper around a \"case-control model.\" A CCM does well when used to from a general hypothesis about, say, what is causing a particular disease outbreak. But it has a problem with being very sensitive to sample errors and it played right into Kellerman\"s hands. \n \n Kellerman took homicide data from three different counties from August 1987 to August 1992. These counties surrounded Seattle (co-author and medical examiner, Donald Reay\"s jurisdiction), Memphis and Cleveland. He then investigated each homicide case to see what lifestyle factors it had (drug-use, renting/owning). The proper thing to do would have been to use a random sample of people who may, or may not have been involved in a homicide. Having found the \"case\", Kellerman now finds a \"control\" nearby who supposedly shared the demographics but did not have a homicide in the household. \n \n Here is where everything goes to hell in a handbasket. First, Kellerman was only able to get 388 valid cases out of 1860 official reports but only 316 matched controls. Such a small sample is prone to wide statistical variations absent an agenda such as Kellerman et al. It would be interesting to see why, exactly, Kellerman decided to drop so many cases from the study--but none of the analyses that I have read were writtenread were written after 1996. Again, homicides whether lawful or not are included along with suicides. And even \"police\" was listed as a category in the \"Offender\" column. \n \n What Kellerman found was that in the homicide homes, 71% of the victims had high rates of criminal activity which agrees with other studies which find that 75% of murderers and 75% of cop killers are adults with long felony histories.. Hardly something that would compare to the rest of America. No, the gun didn't do it. The nature of the criminal did. Criminals killing criminals. \n \n The study never made an effort to decide whether the person being killed was an intruder --OR--whether the gun which may or may not have been present was actually used. And since Kellerman's study shows that 71% of the homicide victims were killed by people whose relationship to the victim indicates that the killer did not live in the victim's house--and presumably brought his own weapon, if any, with him. All Kellerman asked was, \"In this household where a homicide was committed, was there a gun, any gun, in the house?\" Nothing more. \n \n It turns out that the cases did not quite match up with the controls. While the cases had an overwhelming violent history of crime, assault, drug abuse and, drug abuse and domestic violence (real stuff, notthe pushy- shovey type) the controls background check consisted of, \"Were you ever arrested?\" Well, I have been arrested--failure to appear in court for not licensing my dog. Not the same stuff. Also, nothing was asked of convictions or seriousness of the crime. \n \n Kellerman, goes to the control house which must be at least \"one block\" away from the case house, but no maximum is listed. They could have been way far away from the nasty murder neighborhood. Anyone who has traveled through Phoenix can pass by $200,000 homes and stumble right into run-down apartments and nasty trailer parks in a heartbeat. \n \n So Kellerman comes up with what he calls a \"risk ratio\" or \"relative risk\" which is actually just a statistical \"odds ratio\". Kellerman uses the term \"risk\" to make his pronouncement more terrifying. In logic, this is called an \"equivocation.\" But was does a 2.7 odds ratio mean? An odds ratio of 1.0 denotes a positive risk. Negative 1.0 denotes an opposite association. An odds ratio from 1.1 to 3.0 is shown to mean a \"weak or nonexistent\" association. 3.1 to 8.0 is considered moderate. 8.0-16 is considered strong. And over 16.0 is extremely strong. Kellerman's odds ratiorman's odds ratio of 2.7 then, is meaningless. And his 95% confidence interval measurement of 1.7 to 2.7 shows that his measurement is actually quite good. Tight CI spreads are better. If a CI shifts in one direction, it suggests that the correct number is actually toward that shift. Recall that Kellerman's odds ratio of 43 in his 1986 study was not matched with any CI. Now you know why. :) \n \n So, Kellerman measured odds ratios for other behavioral and environmental factors. I wonder how they aligned with the chance of our criminal buddies getting themselves killed? Let's have a look. The tables might take some adjusting to view properly. \n \n Behavior Odds Ratio Confidence Interval \n \n 1) Victim Drank Alcohol 2.6 1.9-3.5 \n \n 2) Drinking Problems (house) 7.0 4.2-11.8 \n \n 3) Drinking Problems (work) 10.7 4.1-27.5 \n \n 4) Victim Drink Prob (work) 20.0 4.9-82.4 \n \n 5) Housemember drugs 9.0 5.4-15.0 \n \n 6) Victim uses drugs 6.8 3.8-12.0 \n \n 7) Physical fights (drinking) 8.9 5.2-15.3 \n \n 8) Medical attention (fight) 10.2 5.2-20.0 \n \n 9) Any household arrested 4.2 3.0-6.0 \n \n 10 Victim arrested 3.5 2.4-5.2 \n \n ed 3.5 2.4-5.2 \n \n Environmental Factors \n \n 1) Home Rented 5.9 3.8-9.2 \n \n 2) Victim lived along 3.4 2.2-5.1 \n \n 3) Security access 2.3 1.2-4.4 \n \n And now, finally, we get to guns... \n \n 4) Gun(s) in home 1.6 1.2-2.2 \n \n Handgun 1.9 1.4-2.7 \n \n Shotgun 0.7 0.5-1.1 \n \n Rifle 0.8 0.5-1.3 \n \n Did you guys catch the significance of that?

   "The NEJM is fllled with expert research. Medics deal with thousands of dead or injured gunshot victims. There's nothing wrong with the methodology.\n\n \n I think we cleared up that bit of misunderstanding. If not, here it is from the old HE WOLF himself for your edification.\n Firearms in America: The Facts\n \n *Footnote. When anti-gun activists list the number of deaths per year from firearms, they neglect to mention that 60 percent of the 30,000 figure they often use are suicides. They also fail to mention that at least three-quarters of the 12,000 homicides are criminals killing other criminals in disputes over illicit drugs, or police shooting criminals engaged in felonies. Subtracting those, we are left with no more than 3,000 deaths that I think most would consider truly lamentable.\n \n \n Dr. Martin Fackler is America's most foremost forensic expert on ballistic injuries. \n \n He writes: \nI must confess to being a member of a very dangerous group. I am a physician: We cause more than 100,000 deaths per year in the USA by mistakes and various degrees of carelessness in treating our patients. Why does society tolerate us? \n Because we save far more patients than we kill. Firearms are entirely analogous. Although used in far fewer deaths* - they are used to prevent about 75 crimes for each death. Firearms, like physicians, prevent far more deaths than they cause. (Gary Kleck, \"Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America,\" Hawthorne, N.Y., Aldine de Gruyter Publisher, 1991)\n \n Consider the implications of the fact that firearms save many more lives than they take. That means decreasing the number of firearms would actually cause an increase in violent crime and deaths from firearms. \n \n This inverse relationship between the number of firearms in the hands of the public and the amount of violent crime has, in fact, been proven beyond any reasonable doubt. (John R. Lott Jr., \"More Guns Less Crime,\" University of Chicago Press, 1998)\n \n History supports the inverse firearm-crime relationship. In \"Firearms Control - A Study of Armed Crime and Firearms Control\" in England and Wales (London, Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1972, p. 243), Chief Inspector Colin Greenwood found that:\n \n No matter how one approaches the figures, one is forced to the rather startling conclusion that the use of firearms in crime was very much less when there were no controls of any sort. ... Half a century of strict controls on pistols has ended, perversely, with a far greater use of this class of weapons in crime than ever before.\n \n In Tasmania, Australia, on 28 April 1996, a lone gunman killed 35 and wounded 21 at the Port Arthur Historic Site. The Australian legislature reacted by outlawing self-loading rifles and pump as well as self-loading shotguns. One year after the massive confiscation of guns the effects of this action became clear. Every category of violent crime had increased; the most striking was a 300 percent increase in assaults against the elderly\n \n (SNIP) more follows...",

   "The gun lobbyists McPhedran and Baker1 write of their concern about the 'misleading picture' painted by Lynch and Black2 regarding the impact of Australia's major gun law reforms of 1996 on firearm deaths. Readers may value the following information in considering who is being misleading here. \n \n In 1996, Australia's Federal and state governments acted to radically reform gun laws, following a gunman killing 35 civilians at a tourist site, using two military style semi-automatic weapons. This incident was the 13th mass shooting in 15 years in which five or more victims died.3 Key components of the law reforms were effectively to ban all semi-automatic long arms and rapid-action shotguns from civilian ownership; amnesties and market-price gun buybacks in which more than 820,000 firearms were removed from the community;4 the formal repudiation of self-defence as a legally acknowledged reason to own a gun; and a requirement that all firearms be registered. \n \n In the 13 years and eight months since the law reforms, there have been no mass shootings. While the rate of firearm homicide was reducing by an average of 3% per year prior to the law reforms, this increased to 7.5% per year after the introduction of the new laws, although this failed to reach statistical significance (P = 0.15) only because of the low power inherent in the small numbers involved.3 Firearm-related suicides in men declined from 3.4 deaths per 100,000 person years in 1997 to 1.3 per 100,000 person years, representing a decline of 59.9%. The rate of all other suicides declined from 19.9 deaths per 100,000 person-years in 1997 to 15.0 per 100,000 person-years in 2005, representing a decline of 24.5%. The yearly change in firearm-related suicides in men was -8.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] -10.2% to -7.0%), and the yearly change in other suicides was -4.1% (95% CI -4.7% to -3.5%), less than half the rate of fall in firearm suicide.5 \n \n McPhedran and Baker fail to note the reason why the law reforms occurred. An analogy may assist in appreciating the significance of this omission. Imagine if a government addressed recurrent episodes of multiple-occupant level-crossing car/train collisions by mandating alarmed barrier gates. A decade later, the obvious question to ask would be, 'Have there been fewer level crossing collisions and fatalities?' Asking 'Have there been fewer road toll deaths from any cause?' could provide bonus information about possible collateral benefits of the intervention but would not be the main question to ask. The outlawing of rapid-fire rifles and shotguns in the revised Australian gun laws was the equivalent of level-crossing barrier-gate legislation: its primary intention was to reduce mass shootings, a national concern after the Port Arthur massacre. Accelerating the reduction in overall firearm deaths - as occurred - is a bonus, particularly as the data show that there is no evidence of method substitution for either suicide or homicide.3 \n \n McPhedran and Baker have repeatedly sought to repudiate these outcomes1,6 using methods that have been heavily criticized.5,7 The reforms were strongly supported by citizens and constantly framed by Australia's then Prime Minister, John Howard, as a way of preventing Australia from travelling 'down the American road' of gun deaths and violence. The USA has 14 times Australia's population,8,9 146 times its firearm suicide deaths (16,883 versus 116 in 2006),10,11 and 474 times Australia's firearm homicide rate (12,791 in 2006 versus 27 in 2006/7).10,12 While news of the latest gun massacre in the United States remains depressingly common, Australians today enjoy a much safer community. \n Firearm deaths in Australia after law reform -- Chapman 50 (1): 53 -- Medicine, Science and the Law\n\n \n Hold that thought: \"In the 13 years and eight months since the law reforms, there have been no mass shootings. While the rate of firearm homicide was reducing by an average of 3% per year prior to the law reforms, this increased to 7.5% per year after the introduction of the new laws, although this failed to reach statistical significance (P = 0.15) only because of the low power inherent in the small numbers involved.3 Firearm-related suicides in men declined from 3.4 deaths per 100,000 person years in 1997 to 1.3 per 100,000 person years, representing a decline of 59.9%. The rate of all other suicides declined from 19.9 deaths per 100,000 person-years in 1997 to 15.0 per 100,000 person-years in 2005, representing a decline of 24.5%. The yearly change in firearm-related suicides in men was -8.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] -10.2% to -7.0%), and the yearly change in other suicides was -4.1% (95% CI -4.7% to -3.5%), less than half the rate of fall in firearm suicide.5\"\n \n So now people aren't using a gun because they can't get a rapid fire semi auto or a \"fast action pump shotgun\"? Last I checked, they only need one chicken wing or are you insinuating that antipodeans are all bad shots and require follow ups to make up for poor marksmanship? Chicken wing emoticon_xclown\n \n Here is another doozy of a claim: \nPrime Minister, John Howard, as a way of preventing Australia from travelling 'down the American road' of gun deaths and violence. The USA has 14 times Australia's population,8,9 146 times its firearm suicide deaths (16,883 versus 116 in 2006),10,11 and 474 times Australia's firearm homicide rate (12,791 in 2006 versus 27 in 2006/7).10,12 While news of the latest gun massacre in the United States remains depressingly common, Australians today enjoy a much safer community. [/B][/U]\n\n \n Didn't the antipodeans just fire Howard ? You also changed horses, and claims from one breath to the next. Unimpressive. Care to mention Japan and the massive suicides despite no guns? I thought not. Safer for criminals but you always were a penal colony of GB. :) If just one other had been armed at Port Arthur things could be quite different. Why is the records sealed for 100 years? Inside job? emoticon_smile emoticon_xclown",

   "The gun lobbyists McPhedran and Baker1 write of their concern about the 'misleading picture' painted by Lynch and Black2 regarding the impact of Australia's major gun law reforms of 1996 on firearm deaths. Readers may value the following information in considering who is being misleading here. \n \n In 1996, Australia's Federal and state governments acted to radically reform gun laws, following a gunman killing 35 civilians at a tourist site, using two military style semi-automatic weapons. This incident was the 13th mass shooting in 15 years in which five or more victims died.3 Key components of the law reforms were effectively to ban all semi-automatic long arms and rapid-action shotguns from civilian ownership; amnesties and market-price gun buybacks in which more than 820,000 firearms were removed from the community;4 the formal repudiation of self-defence as a legally acknowledged reason to own a gun; and a requirement that all firearms be registered. \n \n In the 13 years and eight months since the law reforms, there have been no mass shootings. While the rate of firearm homicide was reducing by an average of 3% per year prior to the law reforms, this increased to 7.5% per year after the introduction of the new laws, although this failed to reach statistical significance (P = 0.15) only because of the low power inherent in the small numbers involved.3 Firearm-related suicides in men declined from 3.4 deaths per 100,000 person years in 1997 to 1.3 per 100,000 person years, representing a decline of 59.9%. The rate of all other suicides declined from 19.9 deaths per 100,000 person-years in 1997 to 15.0 per 100,000 person-years in 2005, representing a decline of 24.5%. The yearly change in firearm-related suicides in men was -8.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] -10.2% to -7.0%), and the yearly change in other suicides was -4.1% (95% CI -4.7% to -3.5%), less than half the rate of fall in firearm suicide.5 \n \n McPhedran and Baker fail to note the reason why the law reforms occurred. An analogy may assist in appreciating the significance of this omission. Imagine if a government addressed recurrent episodes of multiple-occupant level-crossing car/train collisions by mandating alarmed barrier gates. A decade later, the obvious question to ask would be, 'Have there been fewer level crossing collisions and fatalities?' Asking 'Have there been fewer road toll deaths from any cause?' could provide bonus information about possible collateral benefits of the intervention but would not be the main question to ask. The outlawing of rapid-fire rifles and shotguns in the revised Australian gun laws was the equivalent of level-crossing barrier-gate legislation: its primary intention was to reduce mass shootings, a national concern after the Port Arthur massacre. Accelerating the reduction in overall firearm deaths - as occurred - is a bonus, particularly as the data show that there is no evidence of method substitution for either suicide or homicide.3 \n \n McPhedran and Baker have repeatedly sought to repudiate these outcomes1,6 using methods that have been heavily criticized.5,7 The reforms were strongly supported by citizens and constantly framed by Australia's then Prime Minister, John Howard, as a way of preventing Australia from travelling 'down the American road' of gun deaths and violence. The USA has 14 times Australia's population,8,9 146 times its firearm suicide deaths (16,883 versus 116 in 2006),10,11 and 474 times Australia's firearm homicide rate (12,791 in 2006 versus 27 in 2006/7).10,12 While news of the latest gun massacre in the United States remains depressingly common, Australians today enjoy a much safer community. \n Firearm deaths in Australia after law reform -- Chapman 50 (1): 53 -- Medicine, Science and the Law\n\n \n Sir Winston you can quote McPhedran and Baker and all the others, but us pro\n gun people will always have one thing going for us in the fact that maybe not tomorrow, next week or year but at some point and I think the odds favor\n it you will say \"if only I had a gun\" I could have saved them.\n If you had the gun would you use it to protect your family?or trust the luck in harsh words.I would, so would most people.(use gun) There is no shame in admitting it.\n After all if you do have one squirreled away would you rather be looked down at for using it or not using it.",

   "\n Hey steeevie, Lott lives, never been debunked by any of his critics. BTW, he doesn't make any difference now either. emoticon_smile Your claims, Kellermann stats and gun grabber lies are dead in the water awaiting the torpedoes emoticon_smile It is over, done with, admit it. Love it and live it, freedom rings.\n \n\n Hmmm....\n \n Let's examine the differences between Lott and Kellermann-\n \n 1) Lott claimed to have a conducted a survey which he could never provide evidence for. He kept changing his story about the source of survey which shows that logically at least one of his claims about this matter must have been false. Was he lying when he said others conducted the survey or was he lying when he claimed that he himself had conducted the survey or was he lying both times? By contrast, there wasn't any evidence of Kellerman fabricating any of his surveys.\n \n 2) Other researchers were able to conduct similar studies to Lott's about concealed carry and crime which came to very different conclusions. In Kellermann's case, I don't know of any study and no gun activist here has been able to come up with any study that used the same statistical method as Kellermann (the case control method) and came to the opposite conclusions about the relationship between gun ownership and homicide. \n \"Another principled response would be for the NRA -- one of the richest organizations in America -- to start funding its own research by way of rebuttal. But to shut down all further research is both censorship and anti-science.\"\n Myth: A gun in the home increases personal safety\n \n Yes, the NRA could fund its own research if they were really interested in the truth. Instead, they chose to pressure a Republican Congress into not allowing CDC funds to be used for such purposes. They probably are afraid of what they would find out just as the Catholic church was afraid of what it might find out if it looked through Galileo's telescope hundreds of years ago. \n \n 3) It appears that many gun activists here are pumped full of hatred for Kellermann by claims they read about him from sources of dubious credibility, but I think there is much more evidence of both intentional deception and refutation by other scholars in Lott's case than in Kellermann's case. I am just attempting to make a fair comparison between the two.",

You have a link back so I suggest you link back to the quote and reread it. \n \n The number of gun laws imposed in that time period could also be used by the anti-gun folks as evidence that they are working. For example crime has been down since the passage of the Brady Bill. Are we to assume it caused this because crime and the Brady Bill relate to guns? The answer is no....you gotta look at all the facts. \n \n Now, taken in context my point is to show that you need to look at all of the evidence as opposed to limited subsets. Doc Jones likes to look at Lott and ignore everyone else...but they do exist and the more studies that have come out have shown his conclusion is incorrect or rather cannot be verified. \n \n You shouldn't be willing to just look at evidence that supports your own conclusion. This is how you rely on \"junk science\". Kellermann maybe wrong but so is Lott. Might want to admit this and use argument that actually matter..like what NATO does.\n \n \nOK then. That is a very bold statement! Everyone has kind have given you a free pass, but now it is time that you take responsibilities for your comments. Prove your case!\nI'm not sure that saying guns have no effect on crime either way is bold. If anything it is neutral. If you remember back to the old thread you will notice a large number of studies, including the otherall NAS study in 2004, that show either an unknown correlation, no correlation, or increase in certain crimes. Personally I think unknown correlation is evidence for no correlation when I read the studies. Did you wish for me to explain this?",

You seem to be willing to browbeat people for Junk Science, and then rely on junk science to refute everyone's claim. See below.\n \n \n What they have found is that either they don't know a relationship, there is no relationship, or more guns increase crime. I'm of the opinion that the evidence points to number 2 but that's neither here or there.\n\n You make your case for gun control in just about every statement that you make. I found that odd for someone who is trying to claim the mantel of Middle of the Road. \n \n Yet the real points are, the actual and very dramatic  violent crime and murder rate drop, the 40+% increase in the gun supply,  and the ever increasing number of states that give Concealed Carry permits, (all but two now) while violent crime in the U.S. has been dropping dramatically seem to favor Doc's point. Yet you adamantly make statements like the one above. The evidence does not point to number two. If you want to keep saying this stuff you need to prove it! \n \n Do criminals fear the armed homeowner?   GUNS AND PUBLIC HEALTH: EPIDEMIC OF VIOLENCE OR PANDEMIC OF PROPAGANDA?\n Professors James D. Wright and Peter Rossi. The work that Dolins and Christoffel cite is a report that Wright and Rossi produced stating the results of the survey that they conducted for the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) among 2,000 felons incarcerated in state prisons across the United States.[75] Wright and Rossi reported that 34% of the felons said that they personally had been \"scared off, shot at, wounded, or captured by an armed victim\";[76] 69% said that they knew at least one other criminal who had also;[77] 34% said that when thinking about committing a crime they either \"often\" or \"regularly\" worried that they \"[m]ight get shot at by the victim\";[78] and 57% agreed with the statement, \"Most criminals are more worried about meeting an armed victim than they are about running into the police.\"[79]\n\n \n Yes our murder rate is higher, about 3 more murders, than the following countries, but there's has not dropped appreciably and it cannot be said that any drop has been because of gun control. Anyone wanting to claim this, is going to be asked to prove it. Gun control as crime control has failed in both Australia and England, and to some extent Canada as their violent crime rates are higher than ours. The answer to crime, as the above countries have finally found out, and are now implementing, is more police, strong policing skills, and the best crime fighting equipment that our tax dollars can buy. I am waiting to see the science on Lott's position before I make any statements, however even with the massive increase in firearms here in the U.S., there is one thing we can say. Crime has gone down. Not up. The increase in firearms and CCW has not lead to an increase in crime. If you want to continually make the above claim you have to prove it! \n \n   The most violent country in Europe: Britain is also worse than South Africa and U.S. \nBritain's violent crime record is worse than any other country in the European union, it has been revealed. \n Official crime figures show the UK also has a worse rate for all types of violence than the U.S. and even South Africa - widely considered one of the world's most dangerous countries. \n Country Violent crime rate per 100,000\n 1. UK ------- - 2,034\n 2. Australia ---- 1,677\n 3. South Africa -- 1,609\n 4. Sweden ----- 1,123\n 5. Belgium ----- 1,006\n 6. Canada ----- 935\n 7. Finland ------ 738\n 8. Netherlands -- 676\n 9. Luxembourg - 565\n 10. France --- -- 504 \n\n   Crime in the United States - by Volume and Rate per 100,000 Inhabitants, 1989-2008 \n 2008 Violent crime rate= 454.5\n\n  Even with our massive increase in our gun supply!

   "Steve. You totally misunderstand! \n \n or more guns increase crime.  I'm of the opinion that the evidence points to number 2 but that's neither here or there.\n\n The only thing I said is that you made a bold statement. Prove your case! You shot back asking what I was looking for. Then I explained my reasoning why I though you why you needed to prove your bold statements are true! \n \n I am biased! I admit it! Totally Biased! Let their be no mistakes, and I don't believe I have ever claimed otherwise! emoticon_smile\n \n This is what I say. Here is my only claim! \n \n In 2000 to 2002 The CDC conducted a systematic review of scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of firearms laws in preventing violence, including violent crimes, suicide, and unintentional injury. The systematic review development team identified 51 studies that evaluated the effects of selected firearms laws on violence and met the inclusion criteria for this review. No study was excluded because of limitations in design or execution.  What did they find?  \n &#8220;the task Force found insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of any of the firearms laws or combinations of laws reviewed on violent outcomes.&#8221; \n\n The CDC did suggest more studies. Then a few years later the CDC got a second bite at the apple with The National Academy of Sciences studies. They, along with the Anti-gun Joyce foundation funded, the study. Data on Firearms and Violence Too Weak to Settle Policy Debates; Comprehensive Research Effort Needed\n \n Here is an article about the study Link  who issued a 328-page report based on 253 journal articles, 99 books, 43 government publications, a survey of 80 different gun-control laws and some of its own independent study. \nIn short, the panel could find no link between restrictions on gun ownership and lower rates of crime, firearms violence or even accidents with guns. \n\n So 51 of the best gun control studies the World had to offer, 253 journal articles, 99 books, 43 government publications, a survey of 80 different gun-control laws and some of its own independent study have already been done.\n \n Gun Control is NOT Crime Control, and neither the Anti-gun CDC nor the National Academy of Sciences can prove that it is! So before we allow any more gun control, shouldn't we demand the Antis prove that what they want will work as advertised, before we burden the Constitution further? In the face of such gun control study failure, shouldn't we demand this? \n \n As far as the CCW laws are concerned, I believe that We the People, especially after seeing that CCW does not lead to the blood in the streets predictions that the Anti groups claimed it would, are perfectly satisfied to allow the CCW laws to continue. I am happy! Totally Happy! What you say about it and what you think about those laws means zero to me! emoticon_smile You simply are not part of the equation.\n \n I also say that if Doc or Nato is carrying, then they have the means to defend themselves if necessary! What more important reason for CCW can their be? \n \n However, it is YOU who claimed that \"the evidence points to more guns increase crime.\"\n \n Prove your case! What could be more simple? Prove your case!\n \n Now do you understand?",

   "Personally, I have been assigning the crime drop causation to our Excellently trained police forces, more cops, and better crime fighting equipment. Is anything in depute?\n\n \n I've shortened this up because I think you aren't realizing what you are saying. You paraphrase you are saying \"more guns haven't caused an increase in crime\". So right off the bat we are talking about causation. Fair enough. \n \n Second, you ask me if they above is a FACT. My response is that it is likely but I wouldn't go as far as to say it is a fact. If you were to come up to me on the street and say \"do more guns cause an increase in crime\" I'd say no. But facts require studies and hard proof. Of the few studies we have they show 1) no effect 2) unknown effect 3) increase in crime. We really haven't seen a recent study showing more guns leads to a decrease in crime. \n \n Ok so now we have established that we are looking at causation and that FACT is a strong word requiring solid proof. Finally I want to address why looking at two numbers is not wise. \n \n Let's say you have a hose flowing at 1 GPM (gallon per minute). You decide to start drinking the water at a rate of .5 GPM and you turn up the hose so it is flowing at 1.5 GPM. How much water is hitting the ground before and after you start drinking? The answer is the same amount of water...1 GPM. Can you fairly state you didn't change the flow rate of water because 1 GPM is still soaking into the ground? No, because it is flowing at a rate of 1.5 GPM and you are just drinking part of it. \n \n The same applies to what we are talking about. Crime could be going down regardless of whether or not guns increase crime because the rate at which crime goes down could be greater than the effect of guns increasing it. The net result is obviously less. The opposite is also possible. \n \n In short, you can't take two variables and see they are inverse and assume that because one is down and the other is up the first one didn't cause it to go up. You have to understand all the variables to make this determination. \n \n Make sense?",

Or are they aimed specifically at gun dealers only? \n \n To get back to your question&#8230;.I think such laws (particularly any of the latter laws discriminating against gun dealers only) could be challenged under McDonald. But, we still don&#8217;t have a complete understanding of the full scope of the RKBA under Heller. Although the majority in Heller clearly indicates its ruling has not fully defined the scope of the right, the only thing recognized at the moment is the right to have a firearm for self-defense. In McDonald, for example, Justice Stevens wanted to draw a line in the sand and argue that the Heller right is exclusively limited to self-defense, and further that only firearms in the home are protected (that is, no right to carry them outside the home). McDonald only incorporates the right defined by Heller. McDonald says this right is to have a firearm for self-defense&#8212;and, notably, McDonald does not limit this right to only within the confines of a home. Either way, you could conceivably argue that under Heller, as applied by McDonald to the states, the FFL dealer has a right to have a firearm for self-defense but not for a purpose of selling it. \n \n Can the right be extended to the for-profit commercial activity of a FFL dealer&#8212;either to protect his own business under a theory of a right to engage in commerce and/or under an argument that restricting his business unconstitutionally restricts the rights of others to acquire the self-defense firearms Heller protects? I think it can. In fact I can think of arguments to make in favor of our aggrieved FFL dealer, but I have no idea how SCOTUS would apply Heller and McDonald without having the particulars of a zoning ordinance before me (except for Sotomayor, who after giving assurances that she would respect and be guided by Heller has since made it plain that she would use any new case to try and overturn it).",

   "Ordinances that restrict businesses that generate foot traffic operating from residences are common. How many miles in an unduly?\n \n Thanks for the tip.emoticon_xgood\n\n \n I don't know-other than to say the answer will be however many miles a judge personally thinks is too far. \n \n I think we have to remember that with both Heller and McDonald we were talking about blanket bans, which were very easy to deal with. Heller spoke about these bans by citing with approval an Alabama case:\n \n See also State v. Reid, 1 Ala. 612, 616-617 (1840) (\"A statute which, under the pretence of regulating, amounts to a destruction of the right, or which requires arms to be so borne as to render them wholly useless for the purpose of defence, would be clearly unconstitutional.\") District Of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. ___ 07290, 57 (2008)\n \n That is a hard standard to meet, particularly if zoning laws like the ones you suggest remain content neutral and are not arbitrarily and capriciously aimed only at FFL dealers. Would a zoning law amount to a destruction of the right for local citizens like the total ban in D.C.? If not, then I think the fundamental right designation in McDonald guarantees a strict scrutiny analysis:\n \n The law must be justified by a compelling governmental interest.\n The law must be narrowly tailored to achieve that goal or interest. (If the government action encompasses too much (is overbroad) or fails to address essential aspects of the compelling interest (under-inclusive), then the rule is not considered narrowly tailored)\n The law or policy must be the least restrictive means of achieving the governmental interest.\n \n But this only applies if you can make a convincing argument that the law infringes upon the fundamental and protected Second Amendment right. A different and much easier to meet standard would apply if the issue were viewed only as a right to engage in commerce.\n \n I have argued before McDonald that even with incorporation and fundamental right status (which is what McDonald said) the case would not imperil the vast majority of state and local gun laws. Heller said this about federal laws, and McDonald ultimately says as much for state laws:\n \n Under our precedents, if a Bill of Rights guarantee is fundamental from an American perspective, then, unless stare decisis counsels [Slip Op. 38] otherwise,30 that guarantee is fully binding on the States and thus limits (but by no means eliminates) their ability to devise solutions to social problems that suit local needs and values. As noted by the 38 States that have appeared in this case as amici supporting petitioners, \"[s]tate and local experimentation with reasonable firearms regulations will continue under the Second Amendment.\"  McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U.S. ___ 081521, 37-38 (2010)\n \n And\n \n We made it clear in Heller that our holding did not cast doubt on such longstanding regulatory measures as \"prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill,\" \"laws forbidding the carrying [Slip Op. 40] of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.\" Id., at ___-___ (slip op., at 54-55). We repeat those assurances here. Despite municipal respondents' doomsday proclamations, incorporation does not imperil every law regulating firearms. McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U.S. ___ 081521, 39-40 (2010)\n \n Heller and McDonald are far tamer than our more rabid anti-gunners hold them out to be. So while I would make a strict scrutiny argument against a local zoning ordinance if I were challenging it I don't hold out a lot of hope of winning absent a very egregious law.",

   "One thing our gun hating friends must know that these two recent decisions are monumental, landmark cases and make the 2A devoid of any claims that it is no longer a civil right.\n \n We have many stare decisis cases such as Nunn vs. State of Georgia for example and pre and post antebellum cases that understood the rights incorporated in the BOR which protected the 2A much more than what they would like to discuss.\n \n The implication of the civil rights aspect has chilled souls and frozen hearts in mid-beat. The right can no longer be ignored nor treated like the red headed step child they have grown use to courtesy of propaganda and junk science courtesy of the tax payer for their own use. I doubt many incumbents will remain standing this November which will make the civil rights of the 2A even more meaningful; perhaps the most significant of all the civil rights and the longest fought for. Not discounting all the troops in the recent wars and the economic war certain to materialize soon as has ever depression in the past to end it.\n \n This past month we have seen changes in the price of tobacco quadrupling most prices courtesy of the ATF.

Regardless of the audience the question remains does a particular law of my state run afoul of Heller as applied by McDonald. I still can&#8217;t think of a statute that would be in trouble considering the state of the law in Heller. \n \n The better issue to discuss with the founders is not whether my state&#8217;s laws could survive Heller and McDonald, but whether Heller and McDonald themselves are rightly decided. That would be a fascinating discussion--and I would do very little arguing and a lot of questioning. How close does Heller come to what you intended for the RKBA, etc.? The answers would be priceless. \n \n Let me say this about the effect of McDonald so far&#8230;.\n \n In June &#8217;09 SCOTUS issued Melendez-Diaz and by late August we were buried under an avalanche of 6th. Amendment right of confrontation challenges that threatened to shut down our ability to present drug evidence in court, and it required an emergency session of the legislature to fix the problem SCOTUS created. In June &#8217;10 we get McDonald and the reaction so far has been a big fat yawn. We have not seen the realization of the dire predictions of a massive wave of challenges to our state&#8217;s gun laws. Earlier this month I attended a statewide prosecutor&#8217;s conference at which we received out SCOTUS update&#8212;including a discussion of McDonald (not whether it was right or wrong but simply how it will impact our gun cases and how we should answer arguments challenging our gun laws). I talked with several others and the consensus is that McDonald will not affect any of our laws. But then again my state&#8217;s laws are nothing like the outright bans of D.C. and Chicago.\n \n As far as you last question goes, I don&#8217;t think they would find things all good or all bad, and so my answer would be D.) All of the above (particularly for someone like Jefferson, who had strong opinions on a lot of things and was fond of firearms)",

   "Bryan, I have no illusions about the way things actually are, and I know how we got there. I also understand Star Decisis, however see  MARBURY v. MADISON,  \n and consequently the theory of every such government must be, that an act of the legislature repugnant to the constitution is void. \n \n   Marbury V Madison \nThe people made the Constitution, and the people can unmake it.

Or what city you are a prosecutor in! So that part might prove to be embarrassing. emoticon_emb\n \n So now we have the chance to appear before our Founding Fathers and have them as the final authority since the wrote the binding contract in which, We the People are bound, as well as government! No exceptions! \n \n So OK. We give our Founders the chance to read all of the legal changes we made to the Constitution, and our Bill of Rights, as they have indeed given us the mechanism to accomplish these changes legally in the first place. \n \n First question might be, under what authority, given by the Constitution, did all of these illegal changes happen under? How come the rest of government did not stomp to death every illegal practice? So everything we find that is illegal, according to the Final authority, the Constitution has to go. \n \n However we will stick to gun laws. Our founders might ask, What would we have had to write in the 2nd Amendment if we Really Meant Shall Not infringe? \n \n Then under what authority given to them by our Constitution, did the Congress make gun laws in the first place? Next they would even mention the precedences of Cruikshank and Presser. Even though I believe that the Constitution not binding the states, is a total invention of the SC, but that is neither here or there. In it, the Government as well as We the People were told:\n  U.S. Supreme Court PRESSER v. STATE OF ILLINOIS, 116 U.S. 252 (1886) \n It was so held by this court in the case of U. S. v. Cruikshank, 92 U.S. 542 , 553, in which the chief justice, in delivering the judgment of the court, said that the right of the people to keep and bear arms 'is not a right granted by the constitution. Neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence. The second amendment declares that it shall not be infringed, but this, as has been seen, means no more than that it shall not be infringed by congress. This is one of the amendments that has no other effect than to restrict the powers of the national government,...\n\n So they would then say, our government does not even follow the S.C rulings? The S.C. did not require them to?\n \n I believe they would also ask today's leaders, What gives the Supreme Court the right to deny Privileges and immunities part of the 14th Amendment? How come the rest of government let them get away with this? Just who do they think they are? Do you not realize that We the People ARE the the final authority? (See MARBURY v. MADISON) Did they not change the Constitution in a legal fashion? Then they would ask, Did you (government) change the Constitution in a legal fashion to allow this? So how come this is? \n \n And for the record, Congress has the power to Regulate Commerce. As we recently parsed out, that means to make regular, not add any regulation that congress wants. \n \n So how do think our Founders would give any letters of commendation at all?",
