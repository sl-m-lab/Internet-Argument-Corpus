That's pretty rare these days. He should not veto it if it gets to his desk. He should go on record as personally opposing it for conviction sake but he should be able to overcome his religious convictions and not let them dictate matters of state.\n \n If a President can veto a bill then why even go through the hassle of putting it on his desk?

   "Yes theyr were cultured then but research has still been going on since the late eighties......Research does not start at the culture stage..........\n\n You can't do anything medical with them until you can culture them.\n \n \"Stem cell research\" then, before they were cultured, had been going on since cells had been discovered.\n \n \nNo real such thing as a non-US company...we ownzor everything.\n\n Uh, ok, sure! emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \n \nAlso, you wait to see if the initial concept holds any merit before doing your own federally funded research (private market and state funded is already open...if not, tell CA about it) into the topic.\n\n \n And then are you opposed to doing this research or not?\n Or are you just, for some reason, opposed to federal funds being used?\n \n \nSeems like people are demanding research done in one particular area with nothing more than a lick and a promise by some that it's a good thing to do.\n \n\n The proof-of-concept that embroyonic stem cells can be coaxed into growing into specialized tissue has been done in mice. \n \n Now it's time for all the big discoveries to come rolling out wrt humans, and all the lucrative patents associated with them.\n \n I guess all we have to do is wait 17 years or so before we don't have to worry about those licensing fees.\n \n\n Ummm, yes they would pay if they thought there was a real return. Or, investors get together and do so in group to pool theior resources. Happnes all the time. No need to get the government involved at this stage IMO.\n\n Isn't that what I said?\n Unless it produces a return, they won't invest.\n Surely some biotech companies are investing, but why limit it to this?\n \n \nMaybe because they do...you really shouldn't sell your fellow man short.\n\n Well, then why would anyone be against theraputic cloning?\n Cloning doesn't set out to make copies of whole humans, it sets out to essentially make copies of organs for transplant, cancer therapy, things like that.\n \n \nUmmm, okay...revisionist. People also oppose experimenting on brain dead bodies and the profoundly retarded, those incapable of 'suffering'.\n Has little to do with 'conscious' people. More to do with using humans of any type as guinee pigs and test subjects without their consent.\n\n What do you mean by revisionist?\n \n If the brain dead people can't suffer, and experiments hold the possibility of helping other people end their suffering, then I'm all for it.\n \n If I were brain dead, then I would be DEAD. I would be proud that my body was being donated to the cause of medical science.",

   "So, we should spend our money (that some say we really don't have) to fuel this research...when someone else is willing to do it themselves? Sounds wasteful and non-capitalistic. Let them start it and if it works, pick it up. Win-win. I'm sure that if the science show's some potential, non-federally funded medicines will find a way to implement it and expand upon it and have the dislaimer 'It works' to back them up.\n\n \n That normally works with industries and fields that don't require construction from the ground up, not this one. It would likely take us decades to reach anywhere near the pioneers. Look at the rest of the world. A good argument can be made that many of them are there because their youth were educated in America. Yet that takes time to produce a workforce with the sufficent knowledge and size to properly operate and conduct such activies. I don't think American can afford a decade or two of falling seriously behind. Besides, if we used that logic, we'd be a third world nation. Scientific domiance has been one of the key pillars for US success. Abandoning that now is completely unnacceptable. \n \n \n\n Yeah, if it creats new jobs go for it!!1!!\n As an independantly wealthy person, I desire to hire random smackers. People who walk down the street smacking people at random and paid a comfortable wage to do so. Bush should forgo some of his religious based ideas about the prohibitions on smacking people (assault) because it'll create jobs.\n\n \n Have you taken your medication lately? \n \n \n\n Bush is a public servent. He believes that the ban on cloning and federal funding ban on embryonic stem cell research is in the best interest of his country. \n\n \n No, he is aganist it because of how it destroys life. Never once did he say that he was aganist because of the best interest of the country, but he has said on many occasions that his belief in life is the reason. \n \n Are you normally that incoherent?",

However I don't see why US funds would have to be sunken into in on such a massive scale as some are demanding. It's really politically motivated and has less to do with anything else. There isn't such an issue about nearly any other medical issue that I can recall. Especially when the IS stem cell research being funded.\n It's almost as if those who side with the fetus being equivelent to a mass of tissues forcing others to side with them in funding concepts related to this.\n \n \nThe proof-of-concept that embroyonic stem cells can be coaxed into growing into specialized tissue has been done in mice. \n\n And?\n \n Now it's time for all the big discoveries to come rolling out wrt humans, and all the lucrative patents associated with them.\n \n \nI guess all we have to do is wait 17 years or so before we don't have to worry about those licensing fees.\n\n Or see if there really is a valid reason to do so and then go into periphial areas that other, lesser, countries can't fully exploit and dominate those inovations. Or, the US could stiffle SKs research with other means if they thought it was going on a path that would harm US corporatevil interests.\n \n \nIsn't that what I said?\n Unless it produces a return, they won't invest.\n Surely some biotech companies are investing, but why limit it to this?\n\n Because Bush, and any president has to answer to all the peoples wishes (or, some believe he should) and if he thinks it's not wanted or in their best interest...then you try to get a majority to vote him out and replace him with some bobble header.\n \n \nWell, then why would anyone be against theraputic cloning?\n Cloning doesn't set out to make copies of whole humans, it sets out to essentially make copies of organs for transplant, cancer therapy, things like that.\n\n Maybe your PR campaign isn't effective?\n \n \nIf the brain dead people can't suffer, and experiments hold the possibility of helping other people end their suffering, then I'm all for it.\n\n As an evil person (tm) and some exportent posters could attest, I'm for experimenting on live patients...preferably those of an opposing ideology. ;)\n But, that's neither here nor there. We currently simply don't do such a thing *shrugs*\n Might have to do with fears of the slipper slope position...they wouldn't want such done to themselves.\n \n If I were brain dead, then I would be DEAD. I would be proud that my body was being donated to the cause of medical science.[/QUOTE]\n BTW, ARE you donating your body to science when you die?\n Have you made this aware to others?\n It is your 'choice' though. You willing to force such a thing onto another?\n \n @Duo,\n \n \n The US wouldn't be sacrificing much and our infrastructure in the medical field would still be capable of drawing foreign researchers to our shores to continue their work. We're very adaptable...but, you probably don't realize that or have limited contact with the medical professions.\n The cries of being 'left behind' is fear mongering. Parroting those who don't know and want to capitalise on the issue with government money.\n \n As for medication...Nope, sold them to your momma for sexual services emoticon_rolleyes \n If you don't like return attacks, just ignore the obvious extreme extrapolation of the situation and position forwarded. Lots of things aren't allowed to happen for various reasons that seem good to one party and daft to another. My desire to repeal assault laws (that have existed for ever) to create jobs is only more laughable than desiring to have someone repeal a ban on cloning for financial reasons.\n And, it seems you couldn't be bothered to even respond to the obviously extreme comment. Should I take that as you're incapable of doing so since you know I'm right and smacking people for advertisement purposes should be allowed and that your dazzled at my inovation that would make me and all those who worked for me wealthy beyond their wildest dreams, just like the telemarketers who call at dinner time ([evil laugh]MuAhahahahahaha[/evil laugh]). Or, that you're too worried that to answer it would hit closer to home and that replying that it's not 'right' to 'harm' another for my financial gain and benefit (even if only mildly) is akin to the percieved harm of cloning a human or experimenting with an embryo is 'harming another' is the eyes of some (even if you disagree).\n \n \nNo, he is aganist it because of how it destroys life. Never once did he say that he was aganist because of the best interest of the country, but he has said on many occasions that his belief in life is the reason. \n\n Really? And you can't possibly imagine him thinking that his beliefs are in the best interest of the US people? Seems like he thinks so...and those who voted him in office...again...do also.\n Just because you think there are flaws with his beliefs and that they possibly don't speak for you doesn't mean that he doesn't think that refusing to destroy life is in the best interest of the country. Maybe you spend a considerable amount of your time talking to the man or listeneing to his speeches to have caught were he said 'I don't believe in destroying life is right but doing so would be in the best interest of my country in regards to embrionic stem cell research.'\n It's the same thing as far as Bush is concerned. His beliefs, to him, are in the best interest of the country. Duh.\n Do you need a 'religious fundy' to Duo_Maxwell tranlational hand book?\n Ask VOR or anyother fundy here if they think their religious beliefs are in the best interest of the country.\n \n [qoute[Are you normally that incoherent?[/quote]\n Are you normally an ignorant *******?",
