   "From the Wall Street Journal:\n \n Bolivia's Morales Completes Oil and Gas Nationalization\n Associated Press\n October 29, 2006 2:18 a.m.\n LA PAZ, Bolivia -- President Evo Morales completed his ambitious oil and gas nationalization plan early Sunday with the eleventh-hour signing of contracts allowing Petrobras, Repsol YPF and other international petroleum companies to continue operating in Bolivia under state control.\n \n Just after a midnight Saturday deadline to wrap up the nationalization talks, Mr. Morales joined representatives of eight foreign companies for a signing ceremony in the capital La Paz, marking the achievement of one of his nine-month-old administration's central goals.\n \n Inking new deals with the Bolivian government were two separate affiliates of Petrobras, Repsol YPF, British Gas Bolivia Corporation, Andina, Chaco, Matpetrol, and Pluspetrol. The French company Total SA and the U.S.-based Vintage Petroleum signed nationalization deals on Friday.\n \n Mr. Morales nationalized the South American country's oil and gas industry on May 1. His decree gave foreign companies 180 days to sign new deals ceding majority control of their Bolivian operations or leave the country.\n \n On Sunday, Mr. Morales said the petroleum nationalization would be only the first step in his campaign to recover control of Bolivia's natural resources. \"Bolivia will not be as it was before, a beggar state with many social problems,\" Mr. Morales said. \"We will continue in this path of recovering our natural resources, not only the hydrocarbons but also the minerals and the non-metallics, and all non-renewable natural resources that belong to the Bolivian people.\"\n \n Earlier this month, Mr. Morales announced plans to bring Bolivia's mines under state control. The president also commended the international companies for becoming \"partners\" in Bolivia's future. \"As we have said before, we are looking for good partners,\" the president said. \"We need partners to help us resolve the social problems of our country.\"\n \n Brazilian state energy giant Petrobras is Bolivia's largest single foreign investor and the largest player its natural gas industry, and its long-running and often contentious talks with Mr. Morales' government had been key to the nationalization process.\n \n On Sunday, with the tensions of the negotiations in the past, Mr. Morales spoke warmly of Bolivia's biggest neighbor. \"As Bolivians we recognize that Brazil is the leader of the region, and that's why its businesses are so important to our country,\" he said. \"We are obligated to live with Brazil in a marriage without divorce, because we both need each other.\"\n \n Mr. Morales even offered an endorsement for his ally Brazilian President Lula Inacio da Silva on the eve of his bid for re-election in Brazil's presidential runoff. \"I believe in my friend Lula,\" he said.\n \n While Petrobras is the largest producer of Bolivian gas, Repsol YPF and its subsidiary Andina control the largest share of Bolivia's known gas reserves with 35%. Petrobras controls 16% and Total SA 14%. All three are involved in the massive San Alberto and San Antonio gas fields in southern Bolivia, which together produce some 70% of the country's total natural gas output.\n \n Under the terms of Mr. Morales' nationalization decree, the state raised to 82% from 50% its share of the revenues from the two giant fields, while taking only a 60% share at Bolivia's minor deposits.\n \n The signings represent a political victory for Mr. Morales, who had been for months dogged by criticism over the slow and uncertain progress. In perhaps a nod to past triumphs, the president attended the ceremony in the red-and-blue striped sweater he famously wore during a world tour following his election as Bolivia's first indigenous president last December.\n \n As on Friday night, the signing ceremony took place in the same hall where former President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada privatized Bolivia's gas industry in 1996. In the decade since privatization, Petrobras has invested some $1.5 billion in the exploration and production of Bolivian natural gas.\n \n Demands to re-nationalize Bolivia's natural gas reserves were at the heart of violent 2003 protests that chased Sanchez de Lozada into U.S. exile and catalyzed the indigenous political movement that eventually propelled Mr. Morales to power.\n \n The signing ceremony comes one week after Mr. Morales and Argentine President Nestor Kirchner signed a $17 billion deal significantly expanding Bolivia's natural gas exports to Argentina over the next 20 years. Mr. Morales' government has also recently announced plans to bring Bolivia's mines under state control.\n \n Mr. Morales on Saturday said that nationalization and the Argentine deal would provide Bolivia some $1 billion in revenues this year but in four years' time could produce as much as $4 billion annually.\n Copyright \u00a9 2006 Associated Press",
