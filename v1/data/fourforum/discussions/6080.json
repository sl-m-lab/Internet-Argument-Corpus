   "For someone beginning the shooting sports, I would recommned a 22LR rifle. A fairly simple one, but expandable. Bolt or semi-auto doesn't matter. It should be able to take a scope in the future. Don't go with the cheapest one you can find, but get a brand name. I wish I could recommend a particular model, but it's been a while since I bought a 22 rifle. I'm mostly a pistol guy. Winchester, Marlin and Remington all have good quality 22s for about $130. A decent scope and you have a lifetime of fun. Pop cans at 100 yards!\n \n Get a cleaning kit and use it.\n \n 22s are probably the most fun and cheapest to shoot of all firearms. I have a Ruger 22/45 pistol and have a ball with it all for a couple of bucks in ammo. I can't shoot any other caliber that cheaply, even reloading.",

   "Start with a BB gun. Just kidding. :p Forget the .22 Peashooter too. emoticon_rolleyes That's fine for kids to begin on but I think you can upgrade at your age.\n \n Get a REAL gun. I would suggest a .3006 with a 3X9 scope. Remington makes a fine one. Or go with a model 700 .308 cal. It weighs about 7 1/4 lbs and it is light on the shoulder at the end of the day.\n \n It's awesome punching out bullseyes at the shooting range at 100 yards. One shot...one kill.\n \n As far as shotguns go, go straight to the 12 ga. A Browning automatic will do fine if you can afford it. I have shot several \"25\" trap scores using that gun.\n \n Handguns are just made for killing people. Other than that, I see no purposeful use for them. Besides, the sound of a shell loading into a shotgun chamber is intimidating enough to stop the most hardened criminal. If that sound don't work, it's hard to miss 'em. Being a gun proponent, I will stop short of suggesting handgun restriction, but personally, I could care less if we dumped them all to the bottom of the sea. Odds are you will shoot yourself with one before you ever use it for self-defense. Kids have a way of getting to them as well. Ticking time bomb. Not allowed in my home.\n \n Personally, I own a 12 ga., 410 ga, 20 ga., two .22's, an M1 .30 cal carbine (1943 General Motors issue) , A .243, a .3006, a 30-30 Winchester lever action. My favorite is my .3006. I can shoot the balls off of a mosquito with it at 100 yards.",

   "I would agree with the suggestion of a .22 because of the low cost of a quality weapon and ammunition. I'm a Remington fan myself, but I've got a Ruger 10-22 which is super accurate even for a carbine that cost about $150.00. (but be warned, it is one of those much-feared semi-autos)\n \n If high power is the choice, then I concur with the .308 and/or .30-06 advice. I've owned both, and they are excellent target shooting cartridges.\n \n If home defense, the I suggest a quality .12Ga pump from a name brand dealer like Remington, Winchester, Mossberg, etc. \n \n ----\n \n \"A strong body makes the mind strong.
