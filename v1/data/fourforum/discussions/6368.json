   "Bob Denver has died. \n \n He'll be remembered as the little doofus, Gilligan and the island named for him in TV land.\n \n This comedy, popular in my formative years, will live on in syndication forever I imagine. I haven't watched an episode in years, but it was nothing more than light-hearted, old-fashioned, mindless humor. I watched it for the crush I had on Mary Ann, the girl next door.",

   "Dobie Gillis was much before Gilligan's Island. The pot bust came afterwards however. Also, busted with pot around that same time, was a big heavy set woman known as \"Lu-Lu\" on an old show called Hee-Haw. The two busts made the headlines. Back then, pot was considered really bad. It made you rape and steal and kill and shoot up heroin. :p \n \n These days, it only makes you gobble down lots of twinkies. Funny how times change. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n Bob Denver played an early 60's style \"beatnick\" on a show called The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis.\n \n Uh-oh. I'm giving away my age here ain't I? emoticon_cry Ooooops.",
