   "Thank you, not at this time. It was for a thread on another forum where I was opining a correlation between the stable numerical status of our formal military using National Guard and reservists and the explosion in the number of civilian contractors (mercenaries) being utilized to maintain that politically sensitive number. My point was that contractor status pay levels have contributed to a deterioration of formal military re-enlistment quality at the line level while enriching special interests, an opinion guaranteed to draw vicious flames in a forum frequented by Southern Democrats who champion our military and have historically suffered the highest casualty rates in all foreign engagements. You probably know the drill, one refrains from using the word Bubba as a conversational exclamation point.",
