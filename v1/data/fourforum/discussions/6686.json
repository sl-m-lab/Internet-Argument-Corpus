   "CAIRO (AFP) - One Muslim protestor was killed and dozens more wounded in violent clashes with police in Alexandria amid mounting tensions in the Egyptian Mediterranean city over a Christian video, the interior ministry said. \n \n Following an earlier demonstration that had gathered at least 5,000 people, Muslims angered by release of a DVD by the Saint Girgis Church grouped outside the building again in the evening after breaking their Ramadan fast.\n \n Twenty policemen and sixty protestors were wounded, an interior ministry spokesman told AFP. One wounded protestor, named as Mohammed Zakariya, later succumbed to his injuries in hospital.\n \n One police car and six other vehicles were burned in the clashes, which were still ongoing. Fifty-three protestors had been arrested, the ministry said.\n \n The Muslim protestors had earlier attacked the church and injured a passer-by, as they vented anger over the DVD release of a play produced by Saint Girgis two years ago they consider to be anti-Muslim.\n \n The protests came three days after a man lightly wounded a nun with a knife at the entrance to the same church, and a man who came to her aid was stabbed in the back.\n \n The play, performed by amateur actors, tells the story of a young Christian who converts to Islam and is exhorted by a sheikh to kill priests and destroy churches, according to the independent Al-Dustur paper.\n \n Performances of the play had to be abandoned after it sparked a public outcry.\n \n Church authorities have distanced themselves from the new recordings of the play.\n \n \n \n http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20051021/wl_mideast_afp/egyptreligiondemo\n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1342\n Muslim women, children shield marine killers \n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1334\n London Man 'Shot dead for not being Muslim' \n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1312\n The Myth of Islamic Tolerance \n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1304 \n Tolerance and Pluralism: Muslim clerics want curbs on conversions \n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1261 \n Tolerance and Pluralism: Muslim converts to Christianity face persecution and death in Bangladesh \n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1168\n Are Arab Christians becoming extinct?\n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1146\n Burma: Christian Genocide\n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1112\n Imperialism and Colonialism: \"Jihad is the murdering of Christians and Jews\"\n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1052\n Tolerance and Pluralism: Riot breaks out over opening of church in Turkey\n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1015\n Doctor killed by Islamic Terrorists for converting to Christianity\n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/995\n Tolerance and Pluralism: Why Must Ex-Muslims Live in Fear -- In America?\n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/972\n Malaysia's Muslims have 'no way out'\n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/924\n \"All we did was fall in love and get married.\"\n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/856\n Campaigners take \"apostasy rights\" bid to U.N\n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/816\n Tolerance and pluralism: Gunmen kill priest, wound four others in Indonesia\n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/810\n Christians and Jews Demonized in Saudi Textbooks\n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/804\n Muslims sliced off the nose, ears and tongue of a 14-year-old girl\n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/771\n \n Tolerance and Pluralism in Islam?
