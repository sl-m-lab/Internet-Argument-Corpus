   "Why abortion is perfectly legal...you people really need to kick yourself in the butt for it too. Don't take your anger out on us for it. When states were starting to criminalize abortion back in the 1850s you were HANDED a chance to make an example of them. For many decades you had a CHANCE to make the United States the utopia of coercion childbirth laws but you failed face flat. You let law enforcement become corrupt in power, you allowed public resentment towards coercion childbirth laws to blossom and you turned your back on millions of women who faced unwanted pregnancies. \n Before Roe v Wade...\n There were NO Human Life Amendment.\n There were NO National Right to Life Committee.\n There were NO Crisis Pregnancy Centers.\n There were NO Pro-Life lobbyists. \n All of these happened AFTER abortion was legalized today, 33 years ago. \n When your precious \"unborn children\" were being butchered by the coat-hanger there WASN'T a March for Life rally being held to raise awareness. \n When women were being injured by back-alley abortionists there WASN'T a Life Dynamics to sue criminal abortionists. \n When women were faced with a real crisis pregnancy there WASN'T a single pro-life Crisis Pregnancy Center around to aid them.\n You guys really blew it and you have yourselves to blame. All of the abortion photos, abortion holocaust comparisons and multi-million dollar lobbying efforts won't erase that.",

This isn't a red herring but an extension on your argument. Why wasn't there a pro-life group? Because abortion wasn't an issue at the time. It was a states choice so the views of the people were reflected in the states. I'm sure there were people who thought abortion was wrong then as well. So \"pro-lifers\" did nothing...eventhough pro-life didn't exist...but I don't recall anyone doing anything so again, what is your point? \n \n Nevertheless, I wasn't around then so that fact still remains that your point is irrelevant.\n \n \n I might start saying that pro-choice people didn't try to stop slavery back in 1850....what a dumb argument you make.",
