Whats the best way to go up against creationists bastards seeking the brainwash the populace?\n\n \n G'day, SG.\n \n First off, if I were an Aussie I'd be perturbed that a member of AnswersInGenesis.org was invited into your school in the first place; but that's for you to argue out with your teachers.\n \n Advice?\n \n 1 Don't use insults like 'creationists bastards': you expose yourself to charges of ad hominem attacks, and thus weaken your position.\n \n 2 Be alert for creationists' habitual conflations. The big bang, origin of life and evolution are treated by them as a single indivisible package. Insist that they untangle them, and argue separately for each.\n \n 3 It sounds as though you've done this already, but familiarise yourself with the standard creationist 'arguments'. They have relatively few, and simply re-cycle them constantly. None is very difficul to refute.\n \n 4 Having refuted a creationist 'argument', fully expect it to be trotted out afresh the next time the creo in question finds a forum. Creationists know at heart that rational argument is always inferior to divinely revealed truth, and your rebuttals will wash over them like so much breeze. Hope that your neutral audience, if you have one, will have more open minds.\n \n Cheers!\n \n JH",

   "\n So now I'm looking for advice. Whats the best way to go up against creationists bastards seeking the brainwash the populace?\n\n \n Well good on you for taking a proactive stance against the AiG misinformation campaign emoticon_xgood \n \n To add to what johnhanks said be careful about about insulting them- regardless of how infuriating their position is the weight of evidence and reason is firmly on the side of science. Use this to your advantage as it means you can rise above the personal attacks/character assassination that the likes of AiG so frequently resort to.\n \n Secondly be careful in the use of the term creationist- remember AiG are Young Earth Creationists and do not speak for creationists as a whole- there are Christians who accept the analysis of science yet still see the universe as the creation of God (ie. Old Earth Creationists).\n \n This is significant as it is important to drive the point home that YEC does not speak on behalf of all Christians (as it likes to make out), but are a group on the fringe whose position is seen as ridiculous by Christian and non-Christian alike. Put this to them and you force them to start attacking fellow Christians.\n \n P.S. Welcome to the Forum!",

   "It sounds like you already have a pretty good idea on how to refute creationists. Good job. I'll just reiterate the \"no insults\" advice that everyone else has given.\n \n Question for you. What are the legal implications of having a school assembly dedicated to pushing a religious view in Austrailia? It would most likely be illegal here in America, unless the format was presented in a very carefull manner. Do you have seperation of church and state laws there? I'm also wondering, were you breaking any rules when you handed out your flyers? If not, was your teacher breaking any rules for kicking you out based on their content? I'm not sure what recourse you have here, but it would be good if you could have it be explicitly stated that people can't be disciplined just for not agreeing with creationism.",

Again, I don't know the Australian rules on religion and schools, but here it would be no problem as long as it was outside of the school day and as long as it was not compulsory. But it would be illegal to kick you out of a public assembly because you were handing out papers. If it were me doing it I would have stood outside the room and handed out the papers to people going in/out. It sounds as if you did a pretty good job though. Just always remember, you can never actually convince the creationists (YEC as OccamsRazor said), but you can make them look like XXXXXX in front of a neutral audience. \n \n Why can't something like this happen to me? The best thing that happens at our school is Bush is invited and no one but his supporters, to our school (there was a massive protest, more people than in attendance). But I would have definately liked to see the assembly you talked about. Sounds like a lot of fun even if you did get kicked out :)",
