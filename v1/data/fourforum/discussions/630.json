   "Hi Katie:\n \n Gun shows are presently legal. Anyone in the 50 states can have a gun show in thier own livingroom or as part of a garage sale if they want to.\n \n I can sell my personal firearms to anyone who is legally able to own a firearm. I can not sell them to the mentally ill, felons, and people with a history of domestic abuse.\n \n Gun dealers can also sell guns from my livingroom. Gun dealers who make a living selling guns are required by law to follow the same rules and gun retailers working out of a building. Which means they have to do the Brady background check, the Brady waiting period, and keep records of all sales.\n \n Got any more questions? That is a very good question that many people get confused over. Such as the gun show \"loop hole\". According to the law everyone still has to follow the same laws when selling firearms regardless of where they sell them, gun show or not. So don't believe anyone when they say there is a gun show loop hole.",
