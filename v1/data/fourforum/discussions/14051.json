   "If you know me, you know that I absolutely hate modern pop music. I found a great review of pop music, but I'll save the links until after my rant.\n \n The popularity of a modern pop star is not based on the quality of their music, but rather on the image they portray. Just think of Lady GaGa; currently the masses worship her as a deity, but once her breasts start to sag and her face starts to wrinkle, she'll be forgotten just like all the other pop queens who lasted a couple years. You can better understand why pop stars are popular by comparing them to the big faces in the Country, Rock, and Metal scenes: bands that have been play for twenty or thirty years.\n \n Why do non-pop bands have longer lifespans? Because their fans like them for the quality of their music, so they don't depend on a marketable image to sell albums and concert tickets. On the other hand, pop singers (with the exception of Michael Jackson) are popular, frankly, because they're sexy, everyone else listens to them, and people are generally too mesmerized with the pop singer's image to realize how bad they suck. But once that image no longer fits them, people start flocking like lemmings towards another pretty young woman and the old pop stars are trampled in the process.\n \n My current victim is Justin Bieber - a sixteen year old face in pop music, sings with those irritating little-kid like vocals that girls seem to go crazy for, and got a contract with Island records by smiling and looking cute enough. Just like Britney Spears, he demonstrates that you need no talent to be a pop star - you just need to dehumanize yourself to get a marketable image.\n \n Bieber's image is a 'cute, little' teenage boy. In my personal opinion, Justin Bieber is the lamest thing since Spy Kids but there are less superficial reasons to hate him. I doubt he likes to be adored like a pet guinea pig, but he accepts it because it brings in the money, thus selling himself as a puppet to Island Records. He only needs a lame, child-like voice and a marketable image, and teenage girls flock to buy his albums and attend his concerts. Like other superficial pop stars, his image will only last as long as it fits him.\n \n In conclusion, my prediction is once he gets around 20 years old, singing like a woman will look gay rather than cute, maybe he'll try to jump the shark but if he does, he'll fail hideously, then he'll be forgotten by record companies and fans alike. Questions?\n \n \n\n I hate pop\n I hate pop - I hate Pop To be fair, you can't say that the majority of people who listen to pop are below average IQ. Other than that, he's pretty much right.\n \n I hate pop - I hate Boy/girl bands\n I hate pop - I hate Britney Spears To clarify, I hate Cradle of Filth, they're posers.\n \n",

I think Cradle of Filth is exactly who they want to be.\n \n I would say artists who create non-pop music have a lot harder to find true fans. In my experience anyone I've met who called themselves. \"true fan\" of a band quickly abandon their interest as soon as said band squires a larger following. Instead of enjoying the fact that their \"favorite\" band received some recognition they accuse them of \"selling out\".\n \n In addition, a pop artist has the ability to change with the market. If it can sell they can play it and their fans will respond favorably. A metal band, for example, has to adhere to an image imposed upon them by their fans. If they alter that formula in the slightest they find resent. And to make it more messed up they ate also asked to do something \"new\".\n \n Now don't get me wrong. I am not arguing in defense of pop music. I'm just attempting to show that it's not so bad. And the alternative is not much better.",

And he is hardly the first to sing like a girl. Robert Plant, Bruce Dickinson and Geddy Lee can all atest to the fact that you don't always have to sound like a dude to be manly.\n\n \n I'm sixteen, I don't sound like that. I don't know any male my age that does sound like that. I couldn't even sing or talk as high as him if I tried.\n \n But it's not so much his voice that irritates me as to how he uses it: to look cute enough to be accepted as a sixteen year old in pop music. I don't go around trying to look cute because that would turn me from a human into a stereotype, a thing to be adored but not taken seriously. Justin Beiber uses his voice and image to look cute for the adults. \n \n I think this guy says it better than I can.\n YouTube - Justin Bieber SUCKS (and here's why)\n \n \nI'm not much into Cradle of Filth either but they're just pure theatre. A poser is someone who is trying to be something they're not. I think Cradle of Filth is exactly who they want to be.\n\n \n I guess it's difficult to explain why CoF are posers to a non-metalhead. I'll try, though. In the metal community, Goth is poser. The thing that we don't like about CoF is that they sacrifice an authentic metal sound for a symphonic, emotional, Goth kind of sound that draws larger crowds.\n \n I'm not saying that the only good bands are \"br00tal mekhtul\" because I, and most of the Metal community, enjoy more melodic DM bands like Amon Amarth, Fleshcrawl, some stuff by Children of Bodom, etc. But there's a line as to how much you can sacrifice the metal sound for more fans. Cradle of Filth has definitely crossed that line. \n \n Take this, for example:\n YouTube - Cradle of Filth End of Daze\n There aren't even any guitars throughout the entire song. In metal, guitars are an essential instrument, something that gives the song (and normally, the band) the right to call itself metal. Cradle of Filth also has extensive periods in many songs where there are no guitars, just that choir sound, a sound that is not metal. That is why Cradle of Filth is unappreciated in most of the Metal Community.\n \n \nI would say artists who create non-pop music have a lot harder to find true fans. In my experience anyone I've met who called themselves. \"true fan\" of a band quickly abandon their interest as soon as said band squires a larger following. Instead of enjoying the fact that their \"favorite\" band received some recognition they accuse them of \"selling out\".\n\n \n Gaining popularity is not selling out. For example, the reason people say Metallica are sellouts is because they changed from pure thrash metal to rock music with the albums Load and ReLoad. They alienated their original fan base to sell more albums. A counter-example would be Megadeth. While they are a very successful, popular band, they are a Thrash Metal band and have been since the beginning. In my personal opinion, Megadeth never were incredible - but they're not sellouts or posers.\n \n \nIn addition, a pop artist has the ability to change with the market. If it can sell they can play it and their fans will respond favorably. A metal band, for example, has to adhere to an image imposed upon them by their fans. If they alter that formula in the slightest they find resent. And to make it more messed up they ate also asked to do something \"new\".\n\n \n That's because pop is a broad music genre, so pop stars can get away with just about anything. I'll admit that Metal does take image; but the image is to prove authenticity and doesn't require the performer to have any image of their personality, so their career will last as long as their authenticity lasts. And to use your same logic, the vast majority of \"true\" or \"lifelong\" Lady GaGa fans will forget about her once some new pop queen takes her place.\n \n \nNow don't get me wrong. I am not arguing in defense of pop music. I'm just attempting to show that it's not so bad. And the alternative is not much better.\n\n \n No music is good or bad based on facts. I might be a bit harsh on pop music, but then alot of people are just as harsh on Metal.",

   "There have been some seriously talented pop artists throughout the years. Michael Jackson, Abba, Madonna is still about. I also think pop that has played the border between pop and r&b/soul/hip-hop/rap tends to have more staying power (Prince, Motown, Elvis, even Jay-Z getting to be an old timer).\n \n The problem isn't with the genre - it is what it is. The problem is the dolts who run the music industry today. They are concentrating on the image over the sound in more than just pop. How many truly innovative rock bands are heard anymore? The White Stripes is the latest interesting one I can think of. And lets not even talk about how country has gone straight to the dogs. Its bad pop with a twang. And most new metal makes me want to puke - who are these whiners? Have they ever even listened to Sabbath?\n \n You gotta go local/alternative in any genre to really get to the good stuff (thats new).\n \n For the record - this girl likes to rock.",

   " \n I guess it's difficult to explain why CoF are posers to a non-metalhead.\n\n \n HEY! Watch who you're calling \"not metal\". I have seen Slipknot, Disturbed, Black Daliah Murder, Hatebreed, Metallica twice and I am about to go see Iron Maiden for the 2nd time in June. In fact I am listening to Machine Head as type this.\n \n Yes, I may have musical interests that fall outside of the metal genre but put on Strapping Young Lad and this black man will lose his mind.\n \n \n I'll try, though. In the metal community, Goth is poser. The thing that we don't like about CoF is that they sacrifice an authentic metal sound for a symphonic, emotional, Goth kind of sound that draws larger crowds.\n\n \n The point I'm trying to make is that CoF has always been symphonic metal. They have never claimed to be anything more nor different than that. You can't be a poser unless you tell people you're something you're not.\n \n \nI'm not saying that the only good bands are \"br00tal mekhtul\" because I, and most of the Metal community, enjoy more melodic DM bands like Amon Amarth, Fleshcrawl, some stuff by Children of Bodom, etc.\n\n \n I've never heard of Fleshcrawl but Amon Amarth and Bodom are cool. I'll have to check them out. Any song/album suggestions?\n \n \nBut there's a line as to how much you can sacrifice the metal sound for more fans. Cradle of Filth has definitely crossed that line. \n \n Take this, for example:\n\n \n I don't think they have crossed that line. I just think that they play in a style that you don't like.\n \n And your example is unfair. This is an outro song at the end of the album and is by no means a good representation of their sound. However, I am familiar with their music and I understand the point you are trying to make. \n \n \nThere aren't even any guitars throughout the entire song. In metal, guitars are an essential instrument, something that gives the song (and normally, the band) the right to call itself metal. Cradle of Filth also has extensive periods in many songs where there are no guitars, just that choir sound, a sound that is not metal. That is why Cradle of Filth is unappreciated in most of the Metal Community.\n\n \n I agree with you on the importance of guitar in metal music. In fact I believe the guitar is the most beautiful instrument created no matter what it is being used to play. But I will say that technically, musically and emotionally metal music has a lot in common with classical music. Listen to a bunch of Mozart and then listen to Bodom and tell me Im wrong. (And I'm not just saying that because they quoted the film Amadeus in one of their songs.)\n \n \nGaining popularity is not selling out. For example, the reason people say Metallica are sellouts is because they changed from pure thrash metal to rock music with the albums Load and ReLoad.\n\n \n The reason people call Metallica sellouts is because their fight with Napster. And for some reason feel that their \"favorite\" band doesn't deserve to be paid. But that's for a different thread.\n \n \nI'll admit that Metal does take image; but the image is to prove authenticity and doesn't require the performer to have any image of their personality, so their career will last as long as their authenticity lasts.\n\n \n 1.)If their image differs from their personality how is it authentic?\n \n 2.)The reason a pop performer has to do this stems from the problem of celebrity. You can't choose to become famous. Either you are or you are not. Once fame hits your doorstep both your professional and personal lives became fair game. And you are expected to have them both match. No matter how disingenuous your professional life is. You are forced to uphold an image that may or may not be you.\n \n \nI might be a bit harsh on pop music, but then alot of people are just as harsh on Metal.\n\n \n Very true. And that's enough of my ranting for now...\n \n \nMegadeth\n\n \n A tout le monde\n A tout mes amis\n Je vous aime\n Je dois partir",

Nu metal - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n\n I've never heard of Fleshcrawl but Amon Amarth and Bodom are cool. I'll have to check them out. Any song/album suggestions?\n\n \n Amon Amarth is one of those few bands that always keeps getting better.
