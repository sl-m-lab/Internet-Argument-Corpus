   "While it was an interesting read, I couldn`t disagree more. Some parts look somewhat convincing at first glance, but then fall apart as the author tries to stretch the norms of discourse to be some form of argument for libertarian ideology. I agree that there ar rights. But they ar not objective. Rights ultimatly derive from humans and what they believe that our rights should be. In a democracy, this is done through the democratic process. Perswonally i often find libertarian arguments as heavily un-democratic and based on some kind of notion of objective rights.\n \n Heres my thoughts on the article\n \n Hoppel\n \n I agree that the non-violence (but not necessarily the non-violence axiom) is implicit in a discussion. But only for that particular discussion. I don`t see the connection between compliance to that form of non-violence in the discourse and the libertarian non-violence axiom in society. \n \n He then argues that anyone who participate in an argument where this non-violence axiom is respected automaticly (and sometimes unconciously) accept the ethics underlying the free market. Just because I believe that I should act in a certain way in a situation of discourse does not mean that this way should be applied to society in general. \n \n Hoppel continues to make all his argumentation based on this flawed principle of equating norms of discourse with the norms of society...\n \n As for the estopel argument.\n While I agree that you must have some form of legal \"right\" to avoid \"might makes right\", this seems mostly to me as a non-issue. The arguments says nothing about objective rights, nor does it say anything about the society in general other than that legal systems must be based on \"rights\" to be consequental.\n \n Right sceptisism\n \n Don`t know what the author is trying to say here... The statement that someone don`t have the right to do something clearly acknowledge that there are legal (or moral) rights. That rights are somehow objective or based on the non-violence axiom or anything else of value doesn`t appear to be covered.\n \n As for Madison\n \n Once again, the problem of equating norms for discourse with norms for society. \n \n As for the rest, I`ll get back to it later. There are many long words in that text. I may have misunderstood some of it.",
