You really are damaged goods, aren't you JJ. Notice that isn't a question. Forget the Stonewall reference if that is possible. I didn't post the photo for the Stonewall reference. I posted the photo because it showed that the \"the Radical Women and Freedom Socialists.\" are united to promote a gay cause. This is solid evidence that the american socialists are aligned with the homosexual agenda, and vice versa in a united front to work against the democracy this Republic was founded upon. GET IT?

After all, homosexuals have never been persecuted because of their race, gender or religion, they have been rejected because of their immoral sexual proclivities and unnatural sexual activities.\n\n \n Yes, I can blame the parents alone, because they ARE the ones EXPOSING their children to these events KNOWING full well what they will see upon arrival. As children are the responsibility of the parents and/or guardian, the PARENT and/or GUARDIAN are RESPONSIBLE for what they EXPOSE their children to. What part of PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY aren't you getting? You don't blame others for the mistakes you make, or maybe you do...\n \n In addition, it is not the responsibility of anyone in charge of the event to make sure they don't offend people such as yourself. People are easily offended and you just can't make everyone happy. I get offended everytime someone posts that Leviticus XXXX, but I don't yell at the moderator or try to change the rules just because I don't like it. I don't agree with censorship, seeing as it is so easy to turn around and walk away, or in this case close a window. So why don't you just turn the other cheek?\n \n Militant homosexuals? Is there a force out there that I'm not aware of? A brigade of gays that have taken up arms against the straights? Because I haven't heard of gays attacking straight people... ever.\n \n And excuse me, but you know nothing about my values or my morals and until you actually get to know me, I ask that you not take it into your own hands to proclaim what I am, or am not, for or against. You don't know the struggles I've had with myself and the tiny aspect of my life that is my sexuality. You're opinion of me is based solely on the fact that I am physically attracted to men, which is meaningless.\n \n A lifestyle is that of an avid runner or a follower of Christ. Such things as those are a matter of choice. Homosexuality, from my knowledge as a homosexual male, is not a choice. If I could be physically attracted to women, I would be and I'd be much happier about it since I wouldn't be reading the drivel you are spilling forth right now. I wouldn't have had to pray and wish to be \"normal\" since the age of five until I was twenty-three when I finally accepted my unwanted urges. You know nothing about homosexuality beyond the stereotypes and your Bible which doesn't make a good argument in any case.\n \n I don't go to pride events. I don't walk around naked in the streets. I don't believe in showing pride for something I didn't work towards. I don't sleep around with random strangers or go to bath houses. My world doesn't revolve around some guy's genitalia/anus.\n \n What my world does revolve around: family, friends, work, video games, movies, music, singing and being an overall good person. \n \n Now here's my question for you: In what way do you think it justifiable to make statements about someone, or something, you know nothing about?",

So you'd better wise up before you vapor-lock and wind up in the Pit.\n\n \n Yes yes your God that is sooo vengeful and mean. Do you not read your own scriptures Easy? of course you don't.... Typical Fundamentalist...\n \n soulforce.org\n \n \n PASSAGE 2\n GENESIS 19:1-14\n THE STORY OF SODOM\n \n Now let's consider the second biblical text used by some people to condemn God's gay children. You remember the ancient story of Sodom. First, what does the story of Sodom in Genesis 19 say about God?\n \n When Gary and I arrive at a college or university to speak, there are often protesters carrying signs that read, \"Mel White, Sodomite.\" (Has a nice ring to it.) Actually, I'm not from Sodom. That city was buried beneath the Dead Sea centuries ago. I'm from California -- but perhaps that just confirms their suspicions!\n \n Once again, this story is not primarily about sex. It is primarily about God. Some people say the city of Sodom was destroyed because it was overrun by sexually obsessed homosexuals. In fact, the city of Sodom had been doomed to destruction long before. So what is this passage really about?\n \n Jesus and five Old Testament prophets all speak of the sins that led to the destruction of Sodom -- and not one of them mentions homosexuality. Even Billy Graham doesn't mention homosexuality when he preaches on Sodom.\n \n Listen to what Ezekiel 16:48-49 tell us: \"This is the sin of Sodom; she and her suburbs had pride, excess of food, and prosperous ease, but did not help or encourage the poor and needy. They were arrogant and this was abominable in God's eyes.\"\n \n Today, heterosexuals and homosexuals alike do well to remember that we break God's heart when we spend all we earn on ourselves, when we forget the poor and hungry, when we refuse to do justice or show mercy, when we leave strangers at the gate.\n \n I admit, there are a lot of gay folk who are Sodomites (and a lot of straight folk as well). Sodomites are rich and don't share what they have with the poor. Sodomites have plenty and want more. While millions are hungry, homeless, and sick, Sodomites rush to build bigger homes, buy bigger cars, and own more property -- putting their trust in safer stock portfolios and more secure retirement accounts.\n \n Whatever teaching about sexuality you might get out of this passage, be sure to hear this central, primary truth about God as well. God has called us do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly with our Creator. Sodom was destroyed because its people didn't take God seriously about caring for the poor, the hungry, the homeless, or the outcast.\n \n But what does the story of Sodom say about homosexual orientation as we understand it today? Nothing.\n \n It was common for soldiers, thieves, and bullies to rape a fallen enemy, asserting their victory by dehumanizing and demeaning the vanquished. This act of raping an enemy is about power and revenge, not about homosexuality or homosexual orientation. And it is still happening.\n \n In August 1997, Abner Louima, a young black immigrant from Haiti, was assaulted by several police officers after he was arrested in Brooklyn. Officer Charles Schwarz held Louima down in a restroom at the precinct, while Officer Justin Volpe rammed a broken stick into Louima's rectum. These two men and the three other officers involved in this incident and its cover-up were not gay. This was not a homosexual act. It was about power.\n \n The sexual act that occurs in the story of Sodom is a gang rape -- and homosexuals oppose gang rape as much as anyone. That's why I believe the story of Sodom says a lot about God's will for each of us, but nothing about homosexuality as we understand it today.",

   "Gansao, I understand your point that homosexuality is no more or less deviant than any other sexual deviation, but your definition of sexual deviancy just doesn't support it.\n \n If Sexual Normalcy is vaginal intercourse and Sexual Deviancy is any sexual activity outside of that, than yes, it is true that non-vaginal heterosexual activity is just as deviant as homosexual activity.\n \n The problem is that under your definition, as long as there is vaginal intercourse, pediafilia, incest and beastiality all fall under sexual normalcy. It is only when non-vaginal sexual conduct occurs that those actions become deviant. In other words, a man who masturbates is a sexual deviant whereas a man who engages is vaginal sex with his 7 yr old daughter is not.\n \n Also, you claim that pediafilia is an extreme deviation. Your definition does not support this as it doesn't provide an age limitation on deviancy. In addition, your use of the qualifier \"extreme\" implies that there are different levels of sexual deviancy. Therefore homosexuality can be more or less deviant than other sexual deviant acts. Unless, of course, you believe that all sexual deviations are extreme. But then you've created a tautolgy and the use of the word \"extreme\" is unnecessary.\n \n Now, I don't believe you intended to imply that incest and pediafilia were not deviations; instead that when you remove subjective filters, such as religion and personal circumstance, and look at deviancy as a whole, you will find that homosexuality is just as deviant and therefore shouldn't be treated as having more value than other deviances. But you will have to amend your definition to support this claim.",
