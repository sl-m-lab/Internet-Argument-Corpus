   "Prelude - To Confront the Unkown\n \n \n On the world of Brinterdon were three races of civilization whom relized that the only way the were going to survive the elements of the world would be to work together. In the realization of this the elves, the vampires, and the dwarves sent their leaders who at this time were their strongest of fighting crafts to sign a pact to support each other when the times of havoc came in their lands. When the elves woodland would blaze and dwarves and vampires sent help to prevent farther damage. When the dwarven halls shock in the might of many avalances and elves and vampires sent help to rebuild. When the vampires land was asaled by liquid fire and blinding winds the elves and dwarves sheltered them. This pact was signed by the anicient magics. For many mallania the races thrived and the pact held strong. Then the dwarven halls emptied. Walls calapsed, records crumbled and gold was louted. With the dwarves gone the pact weakend and became less know because the nations had to learn more to protect themselves until the pact was forgotten. Uknown to the vampires their ancient leader as a guesture of peace took in a single elf child to be raised in their ways. That single elve's blood line has grown stronger with each passing of a generation for none of the other races have made the power only found in the combining of bloods. The vampires tired of their barran land moved south and west into the land of elves. When the elves found vampires killing whole villages for land they sent an emmisary of peace to the vapires. When the emmisary did not return the elves declared war on the vampires. The battles lasted for seven centuries until each side sustand so many losses they returned for their forts. Waiting for the other to make a move. A decade has passed since the races have return to their holdings. Now a move was made. A move ment to be or not did not matter for it had been made. That move was made for a single vampire found an anicent dwarven record of the great pact signing. Now know to the vapires that their was a single infitator that could destroy all of their plans within their midst. That one being will do more then any of his predicers will have ever feared. \n \n * * *\n \n \"Sir,\" said Guwnethdor as he bowed. \"One of our scouts has reported a rather large number of vampires staking some induviduals who were in our wood at the same time as the vampires. I request a score of mounted warriors to confront and eliminate this threat.\" The Warhaft inclined his head for a moment at the thought then replied, \"Take a score of the elite squadren to battle this threat. We need to protect our citizens and show the vampires that we will not tollerate this movement. May your sword be swift and your mind sharp Guwnethdor.\"\n Guwnethdor walked out of the Warhaft's study, then started to sprint toward the barracks. When he arived Guwnethdor alerted the score of men there of the mission and told them to be ready to ride swifly as the ascdoren flies. Guwnethdor then walked to the stable across the courtyard and told the keepers to ready his and the warriors mounts and then sent a page to tell the guards to open the gate so they would not be hindered when riding to the wood. The warriors arrived as soon as the mounts were ready.\n The warriors saddled the mounts then rode with all haste toward the wood with-in Guwnethdor had receved the report from. As the group approched a clearing they heard the sounds of battle. As soon as they entered a blinding white flash that turned to a deep blood red stopped them where they stood. When the light recceded they saw twenty-four vampires on the ground dead. In the center of them stood a single man who calapsed almost immediatly. Guwnethdor aproched the calapsed man. When by him Guwnethdor got off his mount to inspect the man. When the man was turned over Guwnethdor jumped back. Once back on his mount Guwnethdor called the warriors to take the warrior back to the castle. When the warriors left he muttered to himself, \"This is an ill oman, few can tell the meaning of this and the only one I can find now is unconceus.\"\n \n \n \n Would anyone read this book from the prelude? If not why? Please don't be nice if you find something wrong with it tell me. Thank you for your imput.",

   "Heres my assessment of your book based on age:\n \n If you are:\n \n 0 to 8 years old - YOU ARE A GENIUS! You have an extremely bright future ahead of you if you have already grasped reading and writing! Branch out into as many things as you can! Round yourself out! You have the potential for being a very successful person, and for having a very positive (or negative) influence on the world if you are already this far ahead of the power curve! Keep it up kiddo!\n \n 9 to 15 - You display a HIGHLY vivid imagination, and are probably highly intelligent and/or driven to have had the self discipline to write this and to continue writing. Branch out! Read everything you can about everything! You'll go very far!\n \n 15 - 21 - Writing your own book is fun isn't it? Even at 21 if you sat down and took the time to actually write something while the rest of your peers are probably passed out drunk or are clumsily trying to cop a feel, you're probably a very intelligent driven person with a vivid imagination! Keep it up, but don't get sucked into only reading fantasy or sci-fi! Branch out and read and experience everything you can! It will make you that much of a better writer/thinker!\n \n 22 - 35 - GET A LIFE! If its been this long and you've just now started writing some fantasy novel, its probably time to get over childhood fantasies and get real job! Do yourself a favor: Burn the manuscript and focus on the last years of college or your job! Start reading non-fiction stuff and researching stuff that (hopefully) should start interesting you.\n \n 36 - Death - You are probably having emotional problems and are retreating from yourself and your problems by writing this book. SEEK HELP AND GROW UP. You're not a kid anymore! Start living like an adult!",

   "The main problem with the book is that it involves dwarves, elves and vampires. Presumably vampires subsist by drinking the blood of others (that's what makes them vampires, isn't it?), so how could other races form any kind of enduring alliance with them?\n \n Secondly, if these are the races involved, why do the main characters appear to have the culture of a stereotypical medieval human society (or are these characters human?)\n \n You can essentially replace the three factions with human races, religions or cultures and probably have a story which makes more sense and is more believable, you can then draw more easily from existing or historical human cultures to create the names of people and places involved in the story, and since they mirror actual languages and cultures they will tend to make sense. (Whereas vampires who ally with other races rather than drink their blood and elves who talk like humans really don't).",

   "Regardless of the content, you need some strong work in the basics. First, the spelling and grammar are so poor as to make it barely readable. That is very irritating and no one is going to care about what you are trying to say, if you don't take care of this. This is not nit-picking, the basic rules are there to make things universally comprehensible.\n \n Second, as Collin said, it is completely unorganized. You keep introducing new ideas without explaining them. You jump to a new topic without completing a previous thought. Style, as well, is important so that the speech can flow. Writing has a tempo and rhythm and variety and surprises that makes it enjoyable and yours has none. You also need to better understand the precsise meaning of every word you use.\n \n Lastly, the content. It's pretty derivative. Also, do you expect everyone to know what a Dwarf is? I realize this is a prelude and you are jumping into the middle of the action, but you make a huge number of assumptions about what the reader knows. A skillfully written short story, for example, jumps into the middle of things right at the start and you don't miss a beat. You know just what is going on. This is accomplished in part by using the perfect words and phrases that succinctly describe big ideas. \n \n Keep trying. Good luck.",

Grammatical and spelling errors communicate to me that the message is not one with which I need be concerned. \n \n I have gone back and reviewed randomly.
