   "Majority of Christianity is FAKE\n \n \n \nBe careful to differentiate between teachings and ritual.\n\n \n I agree with some of what you've said, however I feel though that I have differentiated between what is teaching (from the bible) and what is custom/ritual. For example, Winter Festivals are ritual/customary/tradition, whereas Christ's memorial is teaching. Jesus himself said that we need to distinguish the difference between customs and bible truth. But if the rituals etc are in direct violation of the bibles teachings (e.g. Paganism) then Christians should be no part of them. Jesus condemned the religious leaders (who were mostly Pharisees) of his day for following traditions more so than biblical teaching - \n \n Then there came to Jesus from Jerusalem Pharisees and scribes, saying: \"Why is it your disciples overstep the tradition of the men of former times? For example, they do not wash their hands when about to eat a meal.\"\n In reply he said to them: \"Why is it YOU also overstep the commandment of God because of YOUR tradition? For example, God said, 'Honor your father and your mother'; and, 'Let him that reviles father or mother end up in death.' But YOU say, 'Whoever says to his father or mother: \"Whatever I have by which you might get benefit from me is a gift dedicated to God,\" he must not honor his father at all.' And so YOU have made the word of God invalid because of YOUR tradition.(Matt. 15:1-6)\n \n Now the Pharisees and some of the scribes that had come from Jerusalem gathered about him. And when they saw some of his disciples eat their meal with defiled hands, that is, unwashed ones- for the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands up to the elbow, holding fast the tradition of the men of former times, and, when back from market, they do not eat unless they cleanse themselves by sprinkling; and there are many other traditions that they have received to hold fast, baptisms of cups and pitchers and copper vessels;- so these Pharisees and scribes asked him: \"Why is it your disciples do not conduct themselves according to the tradition of the men of former times, but they take their meal with defiled hands?\" He said to them: \"Isaiah aptly prophesied about YOU hypocrites, as it is written, 'This people honor me with [their] lips, but their hearts are far removed from me. It is in vain that they keep worshiping me, because they teach as doctrines commands of men.' Letting go the commandment of God, YOU hold fast the tradition of men.\" (Mark 7:1-8)\n \n \nWhat is in...the Bible has lead to endless speculation both amongs Jews and Christians.\n\n \n This is true, however I am arguing from a Christian standpoint, I'm saying that a lot of Christians nowadays are hypocritical.\n \n \nBut then no-one knows when Jesus was born so pick your date.\n\n \n The fact of the matter is that Jesus didn't command his disciples to celebrate his birth, no-where in the bible does it say so. It's not important when Jesus was born. We are told by Jesus to \"remember\" his death (and all that it stands for), which falls on Nisan 14th...same day as the Passover was celebrated. Concerning the day of his death as reckoned on the Gregorian calendar, astronomical calculations show that there was an eclipse of the moon on Friday, April 3, 33#C.E. (Julian calendar), which would be Friday, April 1, on the Gregorian calendar. (Oppolzer's Canon of Eclipses, translated by O.#Gingerich, 1962, p. 344) Eclipses of the moon always occur at the time of full moon. This evidence strongly indicates that Nisan 14, 33#C.E., fell on Thursday-Friday, March 31-April 1, 33#C.E., on the Gregorian calendar.\n \n \n \n...or whether the worship is directed at the Supreme Being with the Icon merely there as a focus..\n\n \n This is simply condemned by the bible...why build an icon in the first place? You don't need such things to pray to God, or worship him.",

   "When times are hard and people just can't seem to grasp the Word of God anymore, then they reach out for something they can grasp.\n \n For example, if someone gets snakebit, they automatically think to go to a hospital to get antivenom. It works, they heal, good times again. That's the natural way of handling that situation.\n \n When someone gets bit by sin, they look for a \"natural\" antivenom, when all these years the Blood of Chirst has already been given. Wasn't enough, though - couldn't see, hear, touch, or taste it...naturally.\n \n \n Hmmm - good post.",

   "Fair enough. But I do take issue with the JW's teachings that Jesus is not God / Jehovah. Here's some of the reasons in the link below.\n \n http://www.christiananswers.net/q-eden/edn-r005.html\n \n There's also this:\n \n Jesus Must Be God \n \n John 1:23 quotes Isaiah 40:3 as saying John the Baptist was to prepare the way of the LORD (Jehovah). John prepared the way before Jesus so Jesus must be LORD (Jehovah). \n \n \n In Isaiah 44:8 God is the only Rock. Psalm 18:31 says, \"Who is the Rock except our God\"? I Corinthians 10:4, identifies Jesus as the Rock. Jesus must also then be God the Rock. \n \n Isaiah 44:24 says that God (Jehovah) is the one who has made all things. Colossians 1:16, speaking of Christ, says that \"all things were created by Him and for him\". Jesus must therefore be Jehovah God. \n \n In Jeremiah 10:10 it says \"the LORD (Jehovah) is the true God\". I John 5:20 states that Jesus is the \"true God\". Jesus must be the true God.\n \n Isaiah 43:10,11 says that \"I, even I, am the LORD; and there is no savior besides Me. Jesus is the Savior (Matthew 1:21, Titus 2:13; 2 Peter 1:1, etc., etc.). Jesus must be God the Savior.\n \n Jehovah knows all things (Psalm 147:5). Jesus knows \"all things.\" (John 16:30). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n Jehovah alone is the only one who knows the hearts of all men. (1 Kings 8:39; Jeremiah 17:9-10). Jesus knows the hearts of all men. (John 2:24-25; Rev. 2:18, 23). Jesus must be God.\n \n Jehovah is our sanctifier. (Exodus 31:13). Jesus sanctifies us (Hebrews 10:10). Only God is the sanctifier of men. Jesus must be God.\n \n Jehovah is our peace (Judges 6:23). Jesus is our peace (Ephesians 2:14). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n Jehovah is our righteousness (Jeremiah 23:6). Jesus is our righteousness. (Romans 3:21-22; 1 Corinthians 1:30). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n Jehovah is the giver of life who will not allow His people to be delivered / snatched out of His hand (Deuteronomy 32:39). Jesus is the giver of life who will not allow His people to be \"snatched\" out of His hand. (John 10:28). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n Jehovah's voice is \"like the roar of rushing waters\" (Ezekiel 43:2). Jesus' \"voice was like the sound of rushing waters\" (Revelation 1:15). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n Jehovah is present everywhere.(Proverbs 15:3; Jeremiah 23:24; I Kings 8:27); Jesus is omnipresent (John 1:48; Matthew 18:20; 28:20). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n Jehovah's nature does not change (Malachi 3:6). Jesus' nature does not change. (Hebrews 13:8). \n \n Jehovah is the only God we are to \"serve\"(2 Kings 17:35); Jesus (identified as the Creator in Colossians 1:16-17) is to be served (Colossians 3:24). Jesus must be Jehovah. \n \n Jehovah the Lord is to be set apart as holy (Isaiah 8:12b-13). Jesus, as Lord, is to be set apart as holy (1 Peter 3:14b-15a).\n \n Jehovah's glory is not to be given to another (Isaiah 42:8). Jesus shares Jehovah's glory (John 17:5). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n God's name is Jehovah (or Yahweh-YHWH - Isaiah 42:8). Jesus has Jehovah's name (John 17:11; John 16:14-15). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n Jehovah is the \"mighty God\" (Jeremiah 32:17-18; Isaiah 10:20-21). Jesus is the \"mighty God\" (Isaiah 9:6) who is \"Almighty\" (Revelation 1:7-8).\n \n Jehovah is \"the first and the last\" (Isaiah 44:6; 48:12). Jesus is the \"first and the last\" (Revelation 1:17-18; 22:12-13, 20). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n Jehovah is the \"Alpha and the Omega\" (Revelation 1:8; Revelation 21:6-7). Jesus is the \"Alpha and the Omega\" (Revelation 22:12-13, 20). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n Jehovah's title is \"the Holy One\" (Isaiah 47:4). Jesus is \"the Holy One\" (Acts 3:14; John 6:69). Jesus must be Jehovah, the Holy One.\n \n Jehovah is the \"stumbling stone\" of Israel (Isaiah 8:13-15). Jesus is the \"stumbling stone\" of Israel (1 Peter 2:6-8). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n Jehovah is the great Judge who gives life to whom he wishes and who renders to each man \"according\" to his \"deeds\" (Psalm 98:9; Deuteronomy 32:39; Jeremiah 17:9-10). Jesus is the only judge who gives life to whom he wishes and renders to each man \"according\" to his \"deeds\" (John 5:21-22; Revelation 2:18, 23). Jesus must be Jehovah. \n \n Jehovah is the great \"shepherd\" who leads his people to \"the spring of the water of life\" (Psalm 23:1-2; Revelation 21:6-7). Jesus as the \"shepherd\" of His people, leads them \"to springs of the water of life\" (John 10:11-18; Revelation 7:17). THERE IS ONLY ONE SHEPHERD --John 10:16.\n \n Jehovah is \"Lord of Lords\" (Deuteronomy 10:17). Jesus is \"Lord of Lords.\" (Revelation 17:14; 19:16). The Father is Lord of all (Matthew 11:25; Acts 17:24). Jesus is \"Lord of all.\" (Acts 10:36). THERE IS ONLY ONE LORD (Jude 4) .\n \n Jehovah created the universe (Psalm 102:25-27). Jesus created the universe (John 1:3; Colossians 1:15-19; Hebrews 1:10-12). THERE IS ONLY ONE CREATOR. (Isaiah 44:24).

   "Simply put, the majority of Christian teaching today differs a lot from when Jesus started it. In fact, I'd go as far as saying that the majority of so-called \"Christians\" today are an insult to Jesus. Jesus used the bible when speaking to his people and he condoned it. Therefore, as Christians you have to follow ALL the bible. Not just pick and choose which bits you like. Christendom today gives true Christians a bad name, it is false worship. Take a look at these examples of \"Christians\" that go against what the bible teaches:\n \n The Roman Catholic Church permits the worship of Jesus' mother marry.

   "Fair enough. But I do take issue with the JW's teachings that Jesus is not God / Jehovah. Here's some of the reasons in the link below...\n\n \n Good to see you using God's real name (I'm wasn't being rude by not using it, just wanted people who are unfamiliar to understand). I can see why you believe in the Trinity (that God and Jesus are the same person) after reading those scriptures. The trinity is based on a complex set of ideas, however, this doctrine I'm afraid, didn't originate with Christianity. Like Christmas, it has deep Pagan roots, dating back to at least two centuries BC, and has been prominent in many Eastern religions ever since. It was the Roman Catholic Church and Orthodox Church Councils who brought the Trinity doctrine into Christianity. The theologians that wrote the Catholic Encyclopedia admit that there is no Old Testament indication of a triune God, and very little in the New Testament that can be construed that way. They also admit that it was a product of tradition that evolved over four centuries. The RCC gives equal credence to tradition and scripture. In this case tradition is almost the whole criteria for this dogma, aside from a few scriptures that are wrenched out of context and misinterpreted, trying to give the idea legitimacy.\n \n If you research the history of the Trinity you'll see where I'm coming from. \n \n The Christian Church's roots were originally from Judaism, which was, and still is, a monotheistic (One-God) religion. There is no belief in a polytheistic (Plural) God in the Old Testament. On the contrary, OT scriptures declare the singleness of God.\n \n A lot of scriptures can be taken the wrong way. The translation of the bible into English did cause some errors. Take for example to John 1:1, in some translations, \"the Word\" is spoken of as being \"with God\" and as being \"God.\" But other Bible translations say that the Word was \"a god\" or was \"divine,\" meaning not necessarily God but a powerful one. Furthermore, that Bible verse says that \"the Word\" was \"with\" God. That would reasonably exclude him from being that same God. And no matter what is concluded about \"the Word,\" the fact is that only two persons are mentioned at John 1:1, not three. Over and over again, all texts used to try to support the Trinity doctrine utterly fail to do so when examined honestly.\n \n Granted, the bible does sometimes need to be interoperated, (e.g. Revelation, Isaiah are full of symbolic meaning) but the gospels are pretty much spelled out for you. No-where in the gospels does it say anything about a Trinity or that God and Jesus are the same person and most importantly, Jesus himself never ever claimed to be God. Jesus allowed people to draw the conclusion that he was the messiah, but never did he claim to be God himself.\n \n But, someone will ask, does not Jesus state, \"I and my Father are one\"? (John 10:30) True, but did he mean oneness of person or substance, or oneness of work and purpose? Evidently the latter, for he said: \"If I am not doing the works of my Father, do not believe me. But if I am doing them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, in order that you may grasp the fact and may continue knowing that the Father is in union with me and I am in union with the Father.\" Clearly showing that Jesus meant oneness of purpose, of work, of organization are his further words in his prayer for his followers: \"That they may be one just as we are one. I in union with them and you in union with me.\"-John 10:25, 37, 38; 17:20-23. Can you see how easy it is from this to take a scripture out of context?\n \n Thinking of it logically, would it make sense for God to materialize into a man (thus making himself vulnerable to the wicked spirits and the devil), have himself killed and somehow raise HIMSELF back up to heaven as happened to Jesus? For one thing, God is too powerful for \"man to see and yet live\". Jesus is likened to God several times in the bible because of how much he knows God and is like him...as you would expect from a loyal servant who's spent thousands, if not millions of years as Gods companion. Why would the bible refer to Jesus as the son of God, if he weren't?\n \n Throughout the Scriptures Jehovah God is repeatedly termed the Almighty God. \"I appeared unto Abraham, . . . by the name of God Almighty.\" (Gen 17:1; Ex. 6:3; Ezek. 10:5) But his Son is merely termed a mighty one. \"Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O mighty one.\" \"And his name shall be called . . . Mighty God.\" (Ps. 45:3; Isa. 9:6) Jesus appreciated this distinction. In replying to the religious leaders of his day, who accused him of blasphemy, he said: \"Is it not written in your Law, 'I said: You are gods'? If he called 'gods' those against whom the word of God came, and yet the Scripture cannot be nullified, do you say to me whom the Father sanctified and dispatched into the world, 'You blaspheme,' because I said, I am God's Son?\" (John 10:34-36) Yes, Jesus did not claim to be The God, but only God's Son.\n \n That Jesus is inferior to his Father is also apparent from Paul's words at Hebrews 7:7; \"Now without any dispute, the less is blessed by the greater.\" Did Jesus bless God? No, but it was 'God who anointed Jesus with the oil of gladness more so than his partners'. (Heb. 1:8, 9) Jesus was also inferior to his Father in the matter of knowledge, he himself stating regarding the time of a certain future event: \"Concerning that day and hour nobody knows, neither the angels of the heavens nor the Son, but only the Father.\" (Matt. 24:36) Jesus confessed: \"The Father taught me,\" and Paul tells that Jesus did not please himself but learned obedience by the things he suffered. But, \"Who has come to know Jehovah's mind, or who has become his counselor?\" Yes, \"Who has first given to him, so that it must be repaid to him?\"-John 8:27-29, 58; Rom. 11:34, 35; 15:1-3; Heb. 5:8\n \n Why didn't the early Christians believe in the Trinity? Should you not read what Jesus and his disciples had to say first, and then decide what was implied? Rather than have a belief first and try to fit it around what they say? \n \n The very fact that the Son received his life from the Father proves that he could not be coeternal with him. According to the Scriptures, Jehovah God, the great Father and fountain of life, has always existed. \"From everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.\" (Ps. 36:9; 90:2) But the Son received his life from his Father: \"I live because of the Father.\" (John 1:18; 6:57) Clearly Jesus owed his existence to God; but God owes his existence to no one else. Jesus Christ \"is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation\". God is not the image of anyone, but he created creatures in his image. (Gen. 1:26) God was not born, but his creatures were; they had a beginning, but not he. The first of his creatures was his only-begotten Son, \"the beginning of the creation by God.\"-Col. 1:15; Rev. 3:14\n \n Here's a few scriptures to ponder on:\n \n Matt. 3:16, 17 - After being baptized Jesus immediately came up from the water; and, look! the heavens were opened up, and he saw descending like a dove God's spirit coming upon him. Look! Also, there was a voice from the heavens that said: \"This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved.\"\n \n Heb. 10:5-7 - Hence when he comes into the world he says: \"'Sacrifice and offering you did not want, but you prepared a body for me. You did not approve of whole burnt offerings and sin [offering].' Then I said, 'Look! I am come (in the roll of the book it is written about me) to do your will, O God.'\n \n John 14:28 - Jesus himself assures us, \"The Father is greater than I am.\"\n \n I could go on disproving the doctrine of the Trinity but I hope you get my gist. I also hope that you aren't offended by anything I've said, I'm not trying to insult your knowledge or anything, I just want you to understand.",

   "Howdy - \n \n I don't believe the NT writers referenced any pagan sources per se. Their beliefs were founded on OT Judaism and what is found there, as well as what Jesus taught. There is considerable evidence for a Trinity in the OT, as I will show. \n \n ONE GOD OR A TRINITY?\n \n Christianity holds that while the Old Testament is still true in every respect, the Old Testament clearly reveals that God is a unified and triune God (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), and that the Messiah is clearly God the Son. In essence, Christianity agrees with Judaism that there is only one God, but differs with Judaism in that this one God is manifested in three persons. One Christian school teacher was asked by a student how this could possibly be, to which the teacher replied, \"It's sort of like a three-leafed clover, which has three protrusions but is still looked upon as one leaf.\" To the Christian, God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are one in purpose and Spirit, yet each seems to have their own individual manifestations. To this end, I will now provide the Old Testament scriptural evidence for the triune God.\n \n EXAMPLE # 1: The \"Shema\" Verse\n \n For most Jewish people, the \"Shema\" is the foundational verse for the concept of a monotheistic God. It is the very heart of Judaism, and serves to confirm, in the Jewish mind, that there cannot be anything other than one God. The Shema verse is found in Deuteronomy 6:4, and says:\n \n \"Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord.\"\n \n In Hebrew it reads, \"Shema Yisrael Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.\" The word Shema is the first Hebrew word in the passage and means \"hear.\" At first glance this seems to support the Jewish concept of a monotheistic God. However, a careful examination of Deuteronomy 6:4 does not establish a singular, monotheistic God. The last word of the Shema verse is echad, which is translated into English as the word \"one.\" This is what is known as a compound-unity noun - that is to say, a noun which demonstrates oneness or unity, but at the same time contains two or more entities. A number of scriptural examples will help make the point.\n \n Genesis 2:24, speaking of the union of Adam and Eve, reads: \"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become ONE flesh.\" Here, the Hebrew word that is used for \"one\" (one flesh) is the same word for \"one\" that is found in the Shema verse - echad. It clearly speaks of the unity of more than one person into a united, or singular, entity.\n \n In Genesis 1:5, Moses used this same word when he described the first day of creation: \"And God called the light day, and the darkness He called night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.\" This \"one\" day, or \"first\" day is the Hebrew word echad. The one day referred to was comprised of both light and darkness - evening and morning.\n \n And still another example is found in Jeremiah 32, verses 38-39 which reads, \"And they shall be my people, and I will be their God; And I will give THEM ONE HEART.\" Here, the many people are given \"one\" (echad) heart. A unity of two or more individuals into oneness.\n \n Interestingly, however, there is another Hebrew word which signifies an absolute oneness, or singleness. That word is yachid. It is found in such scriptures as Genesis 22:2 (only son - one son), in Proverbs 4:3, in Judges 11:34, in Jeremiah 6:26, Amos 8:10, and in Zechariah 12:10 - \"....and they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for an only son.\" So considering that the Old Testament is the inspired word of God, Jehovah had a choice of using a word that implies singularity (yachid), or plurality in oneness (echad). He chose echad to make his point, so that it might be understood there is a plurality in union. Hence, the Shema verse not only testifies against the singularity of God, but actually implies a unity of two or more entities.\n \n \n EXAMPLE # 2: \"Elohim\"\n \n In the very first verse of the Bible we find a statement which clearly illustrates the plurality of God.\n \n \"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.\"\n Genesis 1:1\n \n The Hebrew word that is used for God in Genesis 1:1 is the word Elohim, a derivitive of the word El. \"El\" tends to denote God in the singular sense, while \"Elohim\" can certainly argue for a plural God. Of the 2,750 times that these words are used in the Old Testament, Elohim, the plural form, is used in 2,500 cases, and is used 32 times in the accounts of the Genesis creation of the heavens and the earth.\n \n Another excellent example of the word Elohim used in a critical text is found in Exodus 20:1, where the Lord is giving the Ten Commandments to Moses and the people of Israel:\n \n \"I am the Lord your God who brought you out of Egypt.\"\n \n Grammatically, it would be acceptable to say, \"I am the Lord your Gods.\" Such examples as these, which occur 2,500 times in the Old Testament, raises the following question: If the scriptures are the divine word of God, why would the Lord consistently select the plural form of God - Elohim, to refer to Him in a plural sense? Why would He not use the singular form, El, in each instance? This is a very serious issue that needs to be addressed for those who believe in a monotheistic God.\n \n EXAMPLE #3: Plurality in Personal Pronouns\n \n Plurality in personal pronouns (such as \"us\" and \"our\") when used in reference to the Lord, lends additional documentary evidence for the plurality of God. A good case in point is Genesis 1:26:\n \n \"Then God said, 'Let us make man in our image, in our likeness,\n and let have dominion over the fist of the sea, and over the birds\n of the air, and over the livestock, and over all the earth.\"\n \n Here, we see a conversation that is taking place prior to the creation of man. Who is this person or persons with whom God is conversing? First, this 'person' or 'persons' is able to communicate with God in His own realm of timeless eternity. Because man had not yet been created, He was not speaking to someone of earthly intelligence, but someone in the heavenly, supernatural and eternal realm.\n \n Secondly, this person or persons with whom God is communicating apparently has the same kind of creative ability as God (\"Let us make\"). This clearly implies a cooperative effort between God (Elohim - plural) and the person or person with whom God is speaking.\n \n And finally, the person or persons with whom God is speaking is comparable, or identical, with God (\"Let us make man in our image, after our likeness\").\n \n When confronted with this passage, modern Jewish rabbis, etc., often claim that God is speaking with angels. However, this explanation fails to address a number of problems. First, there is no indication found anywhere in the Bible that says angels can create life. Secondly, nowhere is it indicated that angels were ever made in the image and likeness of God. And finally, there is no indication from scripture that mankind was ever made in the likeness of angels. \n \n Just one more example. In Genesis chapter 11, God is looking down at man's attempt to build the Tower of Babel to make a name for themselves. In verse 7 God states:\n \n \"Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will\n not understand one another.\"\n \n Once more, the personal pronoun \"us\" is used as a reference to God. Note that in verse 11:5 it is \"the Lord\" that is referred to when \"us\" is later used (\"The Lord came down to see the city\"). \n \n The \"Creators\" of the Universe\n \n The plurality of the Creator (Elohim) in Genesis 1:1 has been dismissed by many as simply a description of God's diverse nature. However, the plurality of the creator of heaven and earth is also seen in a number of other Old Testament verses. For example, in Ecclesiastes 12:1 we read,\n \n \"Remember also thy Creators in the days of thy youth, while the \n evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt\n say, 'I have no pleasure in them.\"\n \n \n The notion of a plural Creator is also seen in Isaiah 54:5, where the prophet states:\n \n \"For thy 'Maker' is thy husband, Jehovah of Hosts is His name.\"\n \n In the above verse, the word \"Maker\" is the Hebrew word \"asa,\" which denotes the plurality of the entity involved in the creative process.\n \n EXAMPLE #4: The Holy Spirit is a Person - God!\n \n While in Genesis 1:2 we see the \"Spirit of God\" moving upon the face of the waters during creation (remember God as \"Elohim,\" a plural creator), there is a very important and often overlooked verse in which the prophet Isaiah reveals that the Holy Spirit is more than just some type of spiritual force. Isaiah 63:10 reads,\n \n \"But they rebelled, and vexed His Holy Spirit: therefore He was\n turned to be their enemy, and He fought against them.\"\n \n The word \"vexed,\" as used above, is the Hebrew word \"atsab,\" which means \"to worry, pain, or anger; to grieve, hurt, or make sorry\" (Zodhiates Old Testament Word Study - Hebrew and Chaldee Dictionary section, page 91). The question, of course, is \"How can some inanimate force be angered or grieved, as we see occurred in the above passage? Only if the Holy Spirit was alive and possessed personal attributes could He experience these types of emotions.\" The Holy Spirit must therefore be a person. \n \n Another important verse that shows that the Holy Spirit is one of the \"Creators\" is found in Job 33:4, which reads,\n \n \"The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty\n hath given me life.\"\n \n Obviously, the Holy Spirit must possess intelligence in order to take part in the creative process. Other \"personal\" attributes of the Holy Spirit are as follows:\n \n 1. The Holy Spirit \"testifies\" (Nehemiah 9:30).\n 2. The Spirit \"instructs\" (Nehemiah 9:20).\n 3. The Spirit \"strives with men\" (Genesis 6:3).\n 4. The Spirit sends messengers (Isaiah 48:16).\n 5. The Spirit enabled Joseph to interpret Pharoah's dreams (Genesis 41:38).\n 6. The Spirit gives wisdom (Exodus 28:3; 31:1-6; 35:31).\n 7. The Holy Spirit is the \"Spirit of Wisdom\" (Isaiah 11:2).\n 8. He is the Spirit of Knowledge (Isaiah 11:2)\n \n Notice clearly that all of the things that the Holy Spirit does requires intelligence of the variety that only God alone can possess. This ties God and the Holy Spirit together in a most closely-knit and inseparable unity. \n \n Considering the aforementioned evidence, we can only conclude that Holy Spirit is a living person (diety), who possesses many of the same intellectual and creative attributes as the Almighty God.\n \n EXAMPLE #5: The Son of God - The Messiah\n \n In Isaiah chapter nine, we read a number of magnificent verses that proclaim the coming Messiah as being God:\n \n \"For unto us a child is born,\n to us a SON is given,\n and the government will be on His shoulders.\" (Isaiah 9:6)\n \n Who is this child that will be born?\n \n \"He will be called Wonderful Counselor,\n Mighty God, Everlasting Father,\n Prince of Peace.\n Of the increase of His government and peace\n there will be no end.\n He will reign on David's throne,\n and over his kingdom,\n establishing and upholding it with\n justice and righteousness,\n from that time on and forever.\" (Isaiah 9:6-7)\n \n How is it that God can be born as a child? This \"child\" that is called \"Mighty God\" is also mentioned in Isaiah 7:14:\n \n \"Therefore, the Lord Himself will give you a sign: The virgin will\n be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call Him,\n 'Immanuel.'\" \n \n Again, God is seen as one who is \"born.\" The name, \"Immanual,\" means \"God with us\" in Hebrew.\n \n Psalm two is another not-so-subtle hint that God has a beloved son:\n \n \"Why do the nations conspire....\n against the Lord and His Anointed One?\n I have installed my King on Zion, my Holy Hill.\n He (the Lord) said to me, 'You are my Son;\n today I have become your Father.\n I will make the nations your inheritance,\n the ends of the earth your possession.\n You will rule them with an iron scepter;\n You will dash them to pieces like pottery.\"\n \n Jewish thought concludes that these verses must be referring to King David or King Solomon, when the king reigns forever on his eternal throne. Yet if you remember in Isaiah 9:6-7 a child will be born who will be called \"Mighty God,\" \"Everlasting Father,\" and \"Prince of Peace,\" who will reign on King David's throne. Who is this person? Is it David that will rule over the nations with an iron sceptor and subdue his enemies, or is it someone else? Well, David seems to know who this person is, and David calls Him, \"Lord:\" \n \n \"The Lord says to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand until I make your\n enemies a footstool for your feet.\" (Psalm 110:1)\n \n Jesus once asked the pharisees of His day, \"Who do you say the Messiah is?\" The pharisees responded, \"The Son of David.\" Jesus replied, \"How then can David, speaking in the Spirit, call Him Lord when he says, 'The Lord says to my Lord, Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet. If he is David's son, how then does David call Him 'Lord?\" The answer, of course, is that the Messiah will be born of an earthly mother (a virgin to be given in marriage to a descendant of King David) and conceived by a heavenly Father (God). Psalm 72 refers to this individual as the \"Royal Son\" who will \"Endure as long as the sun,\" and whom \"All kings shall bow down to,\" and through whom \"All nations shall be blessed\" (Pssalm 72:1, 5, 11, 17).\n \n DANIEL'S VISION OF THE 'SON OF MAN'\n \n In Daniel chapter nine, starting with verse 24, the prophet Daniel gives a critical, time-sensitive prophecy concerning when the Jewish Messiah shall arrive in Jerusalem. This prophecy is known as the \"Seventy Weeks of Daniel,\" and you can read of this prophecy in a later section . But a second vision by Daniel records another individual of similar stature approaching the throne of Almighty God.\n \n In Daniel 7:13-14 we read:\n \n \"In my vision at night I looked, and there before me was one like a\n son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the\n Ancient of Days (Jehovah God) and was led into His presence. He\n was given authority, glory, and sovereign power; all peoples,nations,\n and men of every language worshipped him. His dominion is an\n everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one\n that will never be destroyed.\"\n \n Jesus referred to Himself as the \"Son of Man\" numerous times (Mark 14:21, etc.). In the gospel of Mark 14:62, Jesus was specifically asked if He was the Christ, the Son of the 'Blessed One.' Jesus replied, \"I AM (note: this was the name Jehovah revealed to Moses on Mount Sinai when Moses asked the Lord His name). And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One (note Psalm 110:1) and coming on the clouds of heaven.\" \n \n But as far as the vision of Daniel is concerned, here is that same individual spoken of in Isaiah 9:6-7 who will reign on David's throne, who will have the sovereign power of Almighty God, and whom the peoples and nations of the earth will worship. He is approaching the throne of the \"Ancient of Days,\" who is clearly Jehovah God (see Daniel 7:9-10), and is about to set up his eternal kingdom. Is this not the eternal Messiah, the Son of God? If King David were to reign on this throne, would he desire that all people worship him, or would he do as he did on earth and direct the people's worship towards Almighty God? We will look to the prophet Jeremiah for still another clue.\n \n If by now there are any doubts that God will raise up a Lord (who is someone other than David) who will reign on David's throne, then the prophet Jeremiah foretells who this individual is:\n \n \"The days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will raise up to\n David a righteous Branch, a King who will reign wisely, and do\n what is just and right in the land. In His days Judah will be saved\n and Israel will live in safety. This is the name by which He will be\n called: THE LORD (JEHOVAH) OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.\" (Jeremiah 23:5-7)\n \n Remember, in Jewish theology there can be only one Lord. Yet in the above verse the Lord God is raising up another Lord who is called, \"The Lord (JEHOVAH) our Righteousness.\" Certainly neither David, who committed murder and adultery, or Solomon, who sought after the idols of his many wives, nor any other Jewish King could become the \"Righteousness\" of the people. This is a divine individual, and is the same person that Isaiah and King David refer to as, \"Lord.\" \n \n In all these things - in all these examples, we clearly see that the God of Israel is more than just a monotheistic entity. In fact, the evidence testifies against God being a singular entity, and clearly depicts a unified, Triune God - Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. A unified, triune God explains things better, and only a triune God with the Messiah as the Son of God correctly matches the scripture in perfect harmony with other related scriptures.\n \n Jesus is Lord.\n \n Cheers....",

   " It was the Roman Catholic Church and Orthodox Church Councils who brought the Trinity doctrine into Christianity. \n\n \n The concept of the Trinity is found in the 1st Century NT works, and was alluded to by numerous individuals in the centuries preceding the Council of Nicea. See the information in the following link for that evidence:\n \n http://www.carm.org/doctrine/trinityquotes.htm\n \n \n The theologians that wrote the Catholic Encyclopedia admit that there is no Old Testament indication of a triune God, and very little in the New Testament that can be construed that way. They also admit that it was a product of tradition that evolved over four centuries. The RCC gives equal credence to tradition and scripture. In this case tradition is almost the whole criteria for this dogma, aside from a few scriptures that are wrenched out of context and misinterpreted, trying to give the idea legitimacy.\n\n \n I don't vouch for Catholic history on that, but Catholicism is just one of many early Christian denominations. There were others in various countries, etc. I don't think you can judge all NT doctrines on Catholicism alone. The NT and the early Trinitarian quotes provided counter your argument.\n \n \n The Christian Church's roots were originally from Judaism, which was, and still is, a monotheistic (One-God) religion. There is no belief in a polytheistic (Plural) God in the Old Testament. On the contrary, OT scriptures declare the singleness of God.\n\n \n My previous post provides numerous illustrations to the contrary. Not only that, but there are numerous allusions to the Trinity in early Jewish Rabbinic literature, as can be seen in the following link (starting with the heading \"The Mystery of the Trinity Revealed in Ancient Jewish Writings\"):\n \n http://www.grantjeffrey.com/article/chphnwr.htm\n \n \n A lot of scriptures can be taken the wrong way. The translation of the bible into English did cause some errors. Take for example to John 1:1, in some translations, \"the Word\" is spoken of as being \"with God\" and as being \"God.\" But other Bible translations say that the Word was \"a god\" or was \"divine,\" meaning not necessarily God but a powerful one. Furthermore, that Bible verse says that \"the Word\" was \"with\" God. That would reasonably exclude him from being that same God.\n\n \n Since Jesus was with God (the Father) in the beginning, that doesn't mean Jesus wasn't \"with\" him. Regarding John 1:1, here are various scholarly opinions on the JW's doctrine of \"a God\" (which by the way would make the JW's polytheists instead of monotheists):\n \n http://members.tripod.com/crossbearer-brian/id237.htm\n \n \n No-where in the gospels does it say anything about a Trinity or that God and Jesus are the same person and most importantly, Jesus himself never ever claimed to be God. Jesus allowed people to draw the conclusion that he was the messiah, but never did he claim to be God himself.\n\n \n While the actual term \"Trinity\" is not found in the NT, the concept is seen in numerous places, two of which are Matthew 28:19 (\"...baptizing them in the NAME of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit\"), and Acts 7:55, amongst others.\n \n \n But, someone will ask, does not Jesus state, \"I and my Father are one\"? (John 10:30) True, but did he mean oneness of person or substance, or oneness of work and purpose? Evidently the latter, for he said: \"If I am not doing the works of my Father, do not believe me. But if I am doing them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, in order that you may grasp the fact and may continue knowing that the Father is in union with me and I am in union with the Father.\" Clearly showing that Jesus meant oneness of purpose, of work, of organization are his further words in his prayer for his followers: \"That they may be one just as we are one. I in union with them and you in union with me.\"-John 10:25, 37, 38; 17:20-23. Can you see how easy it is from this to take a scripture out of context?\n\n \n You're welcome to that interpretation, the conclusion of which I tend to disagree with. However, Jesus definitely declared his own divinity (see following link - \"Did Jesus Claim to be God\"?):\n \n http://hometown.aol.com/red4jesus/jesusclaimtobegod.html\n \n \n Throughout the Scriptures Jehovah God is repeatedly termed the Almighty God. \"I appeared unto Abraham, . . . by the name of God Almighty.\" (Gen 17:1; Ex. 6:3; Ezek. 10:5) But his Son is merely termed a mighty one. \"Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O mighty one.\" \"And his name shall be called . . . Mighty God.\" (Ps. 45:3; Isa. 9:6) Jesus appreciated this distinction. In replying to the religious leaders of his day, who accused him of blasphemy, he said: \"Is it not written in your Law, 'I said: You are gods'? If he called 'gods' those against whom the word of God came, and yet the Scripture cannot be nullified, do you say to me whom the Father sanctified and dispatched into the world, 'You blaspheme,' because I said, I am God's Son?\" (John 10:34-36) Yes, Jesus did not claim to be The God, but only God's Son.\n\n \n See the link above. Also, regarding Jesus being only a \"Mighty God\" (vs. \"Almighty\"), Jesus is the \"Lord God... who is Almighty\" - Revelation 1:7-8.\n \n Regarding \"Ye are gods,\" \n \n When the psalmist said \"You are gods,\" in Psalm 82, he was speaking in irony. He was in effect mocking the corrupt judges (many biblical examples) who had become corrupt in their dealings with men. What follows from the 82nd Psalm was this, though: \"I have called you 'gods,' but in fact you will die like the men that you really are.\" Obviously then, they weren't being alluded to as real \"gods\" due to the clarification that followed. With this in mind, it is now clear that when Jesus alluded to this psalm in John chapter 10, He was simply illustrating that what the Israelite judges were called in irony and mockery, Jesus is in reality.\n \n The Jews knew who Jesus was claiming to be (God), and Jesus, as he had done in the past on other arguments, was simply driving home an important truth using Old Testament scripture.\n \n \n That Jesus is inferior to his Father is also apparent from Paul's words at Hebrews 7:7; \"Now without any dispute, the less is blessed by the greater.\" Did Jesus bless God? No, but it was 'God who anointed Jesus with the oil of gladness more so than his partners'. (Heb. 1:8, 9).\n\n \n Since I think you believe that Jesus is the Archangel Michael, and since you referenced Hebrews, then have you read Hebrews 1:5? - \"For to which of the angels did He ever say, \"YOU ARE MY SON, TODAY I HAVE BEGOTTEN YOU\"? The rhetorical answer is NONE. The \"Michael is Jesus\" argument is dispelled in the following link:\n \n http://abrahamic-faith.com/Jesus_superior_to_angels.html\n \n Any reference to Jesus being lesser in nature to the Father deals only with his (at the time) earthly existence. This is illuminated in Philippians 2:5-8 (which also clarifies that Jesus was equal in nature with God):\n \n 5 Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus: \n 6 Who, being in very nature God, \n did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, \n 7 but made himself nothing, \n taking the very nature of a servant, \n being made in human likeness. \n 8 And being found in appearance as a man, \n he humbled himself \n and became obedient to death- \n even death on a cross! \n \n \n Jesus was also inferior to his Father in the matter of knowledge....\n\n \n See above.\n \n \n Why didn't the early Christians believe in the Trinity?\n\n \n Many of them did. That's how the \"Early Trinitarian Quotes\" (linked earlier) got their basis from. \n \n \n The very fact that the Son received his life from the Father proves that he could not be coeternal with him. \n\n \n He was born of God as a human, but previously he was God (John 1:1, Philippians 2:7-9, John 20:28; I Tim. 3:16; Col. 2:9; Acts 20:28, etc.).\n \n \n Here's a few scriptures to ponder on:\n \n Matt. 3:16, 17 - After being baptized Jesus immediately came up from the water; and, look! the heavens were opened up, and he saw descending like a dove God's spirit coming upon him. Look! Also, there was a voice from the heavens that said: \"This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved.\"\n \n Heb. 10:5-7 - Hence when he comes into the world he says: \"'Sacrifice and offering you did not want, but you prepared a body for me. You did not approve of whole burnt offerings and sin [offering].' Then I said, 'Look! I am come (in the roll of the book it is written about me) to do your will, O God.'\n \n John 14:28 - Jesus himself assures us, \"The Father is greater than I am.\"\n \n I could go on disproving the doctrine of the Trinity but I hope you get my gist. I also hope that you aren't offended by anything I've said, I'm not trying to insult your knowledge or anything, I just want you to understand.\n\n \n The gist of all these types of arguments have been addressed (I hope). \n \n Finally:\n \n THE DIETY OF CHRIST\n \n 1. Jesus existed in the beginning (John 1:1; Philip 2:6; Rev. 19:13; Micah 5:2).\n 2. He was with God (John 1:1).\n 3. He is God, the Son (John 1:1; Rom. 9:5; Heb. 1:8, 10; I John 5:20).\n 4. He is God manifest in the flesh (John 20:28; I Tim. 3:16; Col. 2:9; Acts 20:28; Heb. 1:8).\n 5. He is God foretold (Isaiah 9:6; Psalm 45:6).\n 6. He is Immanuel, God with us (Isaiah 7:14; Matthew 1:23).\n 7. He is the true God (I John 5:20 with Titus 2:13; Romans 9:5).\n 8. He is the great God (Titus 2:13).\n 9. He is God our Savior (II Peter 1:1).\n 10. He existed in the form of God before His incarnation and was equal with God the Father \n (Philippians 2:5-7).\n 11. He is the only wise God (Jude 25).\n 12. He is omnipotent over disease. (Matthew 8:1-4; Luke 4:39)\n 13. He is omnipotent over demons. (Matthew 8:16-17; Luke 4:35)\n 14. He is omnipotent over nature. ((Matthew 8:26)\n 15. He is omnipotent over death. (Luke 7:14-15; John 11:25)\n 16. He is omniscient, knowing the hearts of the Pharisees. (Matthew 12:25;\n Luke 5:22; 6:8; 7:39-40)\n 17. He knew the thoughts of the scribes. (Matthew 9:3-4)\n 18. He knew the history of the Samaritan woman. (John 4:24)\n 19. He is omnipresent. (Matthew 18:20; 28:20; John 3:13; 14:20)\n 20. He was worshiped as God by the angels (Hebrews 1:6); worshiped as\n God by the wise men (Matthew 2:2); worshiped as God by the shepherds\n (Luke 2:15); worshiped as God by a ruler (Matthew 9:18); worshiped as\n God by Thomas (John 20:28); worshiped as God by the apostles (Matthew\n 14:33; 28:9).\n 21. He forgives sins. (Mark 2:5)\n 22. He saves. (Matthew 18:11; John 10:28).\n 23. He judges. (John 5:22)\n 24. Paul, Peter, Jude, James, and John called Him God. (Galatians 2:20; 1 Peter\n 3:22; Jude 25; James 2:1; I John 5:20; Revelation 1:18; 19:16)\n 25. He is God's Son, who was sent to bring us eternal life. (John 3:16)\n 26. He arose from death in the flesh (John 20:26-28; Luke 24:39-43; I John 4:2-3). \n 27. One with the Father (John 10:30).\n \n Peace, brother!",

   "If posters like EZ weren't such horrid and spiteful little shits, I could feel sorry for them. I can see the enormous appeal of Christianity for such pathetic types. I think this may have been its appeal for centuries, you can belong to this exclusive club for what, on the surface, seems like a small price - all you have to do is have faith. This is the ingenious spin that Paul added that allowed the sect to take off like wildfire. You may be down-trodden and hopeless, but just say the magic word and you get to be in the club that goes to heaven. And better yet, you are the only club that gets to go to heaven. You don't need to be powerful, or talented or smart (in fact, the latter is a deterrent) to join this groovy club. No matter how dreadful your pathetic existence is here, there is a better day a coming. As an added bonus, you get to feel smug and superior toward the infidels. Even those bullies in school who beat you up. \n \n Prayer and community provide great feeling of personal fulfillment; this is by no means unique to Christianity. Any old belief system will do for that. The vanilla Protestant Christians belong to their church out of habit or tradition, but it is the rabid fundies that savor their membership in this club. They are favored by the supreme Creator of the universe over all peoples. Pretty cool. All you need to do is sell your soul and you are in. Once enrolled, it becomes a real mind #### to get out. The concept of leaving means you will burn in hell fires for all eternity and you have to admit you have been a complete schmuck all along. That is a guaranteed recipe for entrenched denial if there ever was one. What a sad waste of human potential.\n\n \n Spiteful little shits, how flattering! What are you, a psychologist? People like yourself over-analyse everything. There's nothing wrong with having a healthy \"thinking\" brain but you probably sit there for hours on end wondering \"what did he/she mean?!\" You think people like EZ are pathetic, look at yourself, at least he/she is trying to help others, unlike your destructive remarks. You think you know everything about everyone, so who's the one who think's they're high and mighty? And the part about people like EZ being smug despite being bullied at school (because of their faith); is this by any chance yourself relating to your own childhood, you know, feeling smug because you know what drives the bully?\n \n \n \nIn Hebrew it reads, \"Shema Yisrael Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.\" The word Shema is the first Hebrew word in the passage and means \"hear.\" At first glance this seems to support the Jewish concept of a monotheistic God. However, a careful examination of Deuteronomy 6:4 does not establish a singular, monotheistic God. The last word of the Shema verse is echad, which is translated into English as the word \"one.\" This is what is known as a compound-unity noun - that is to say, a noun which demonstrates oneness or unity, but at the same time contains two or more entities. A number of scriptural examples will help make the point.\n \n Genesis 2:24, speaking of the union of Adam and Eve, reads: \"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become ONE flesh.\" Here, the Hebrew word that is used for \"one\" (one flesh) is the same word for \"one\" that is found in the Shema verse - echad. It clearly speaks of the unity of more than one person into a united, or singular, entity\n\n \n \n Well, Easyrider, I think I'll just have to agree to differ! I don't want to spend any more time on this subject...it's obvious to me that you've made your mind up and I respect that (you deffinately have spent some time researching). Just off the top of my head though, from the first few examples you gave, I wouldn't say that they are the best of proof to support the Trinity. The fact that the word echad could mean either one or unity, proves more so that God is in union with Christ (they are very simular) just like a man (that is married to a woman) is in union to her (just as one flesh). Although they are called one flesh, we know that this word echad must mean in union with, because obviously the man and woman are not one entity. Same applies when the word echad is applied to night and day, we know that this must mean in union with because clearly; day and night are not the same thing...but they are in union with each other.\n \n Like I said, I don't see the point in going further into this. :)",

   "Simply put, the majority of Christian teaching today differs a lot from when Jesus started it. In fact, I'd go as far as saying that the majority of so-called \"Christians\" today are an insult to Jesus. Jesus used the bible when speaking to his people and he condoned it. Therefore, as Christians you have to follow ALL the bible. Not just pick and choose which bits you like. Christendom today gives true Christians a bad name, it is false worship. Take a look at these examples of \"Christians\" that go against what the bible teaches:\n \n The Roman Catholic Church permits the worship of Jesus' mother marry. This tradition has PAGAN origin (http://bupc.montana.com/whores/marywors.html) and was not part of the Christian faith.

A rough average being 60 - 100 years later. Even without the politics and control that came later, the best, most accurate account of Jesus has been spread via word of mouth 1 -3, maybe more, generations after the fact. A lot can get lost, added, altered, forgotten, embellished and so on in that amount of time. Especially considering the source. \n \n The entire NT is speculative. The question can still be asked if Jesus really even existed. Christianity has without question drifted very far from it's roots. The facts that can be confirmed show an NT that has been altered, that has been tightly controlled and minupulated for power, politics and personal glory by an organization that has in the past had no problem with the forgery of ducuments, the destruction and/or defamation of science and thought and the murder and/or torture of it's opponents. \n \n If Christianity was based on what is said Jesus said the NT would probably be 20 pages. All the rest are men who had an opinion and found a way to connect that opinion to something Jesus said. \n \n God is God. Plenty of times in the OT if he wanted you to know something you knew it. He even realized that he needed to be real clear with us (The 10 commandments, set in stone) So what happened that he just said figure it out yourselves?",

Mankind has done this prior to Christ and does it today among all non-Christian people throughout the world. Our greatly improved civility toward each other othe the last century or so- abolition of slavery, consideration of civil rights, women's rights, etc - has had much less to do with religion than secular thought. \n To paraphrase the Sam Harris article posted by Simone and electolyte, if one does not understand that cruelty to others is bad beforehand, he won't learn differently by reading the Bible. \n \n \n Look at the last 20 years in the USA where the secular progressives are having their influences.

   "I don't know \"for sure\" what goes on in a Morman temple or a JW kingdom hall, or a masonic lodge, doesn't give me any reason to believe that they're engaging in anything particularly unsavoury. There is a massive difference between performing magic with the intention of causing harm performing magic with other intentions.\n \n A lot of magical practices are forbidden by the Bible, but so are a lot of other things, and I don't consider people who have sex before marriage as being satanic. Committing a sin, possibly (not for me to decide), but not satanic.\n\n \n I didn't say that if you do those sins that you are worshipping Satan, (maybe he influences these sort of sins), but the bible does clearly say that practicing any kind of (real) magic etc is dabbling with the wicked angels and / or Satan. Leviticus 19:26; Deuteronomy 18:9-14; Acts 19:18, 19. The reason for this is because God and his angels are actually not intervening with the earth at this time (this takes a lot of explaining), but rather, Satan and his demon followers are (they have no resitrictions and can interfere with the humans). So when people see spirits (thinking that they are past relatives or something) and play with supernatural stuff (e.g. Weegee Boards etc) nowadays, it is actually bad spirits they're seeing or seeing evidence of. Obviously this is all going to sound like a pile of rubbish to a lot of people, especially scientists, but you have to have an open mind. You cannot deny that what happens with the Weegee board and hypnotism is freaky and real, it's not just psycological like some would say (they only say that because it hasn't happened to them and they don't understand). And yet, no-one really stands back to wonder who's actually behind it all??? The fact is, the devil etc are cold, twisted spirits that only think about sex, death etc. This is one reason why it is woman who are attracted to supernatural stuff, it's because the wicked spirits and their perverted minds are luring them. You will notice this about the weegee board (if you or you're friends have tried one), they always centre on sex, and death etc and the room usually goes cold. Next time you or your friends use a weegee board, ask it who is it's God?\n \n Well, if you look up the definition of Jehovah's Witnesses (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah's_Witnesses) I think that gives a good objective description. JWs are in no way secretive, they preach from house to house what they teach. I used to go to the meetings and their halls are very plain and simple (which is all that is needed), the audience even gets to express themselves over a microphone. They used to be called Bible Students, which is pretty appropriate since they are avid followers of the bible.\n \n I don't know an awful lot about Mormons but I think you know that what they teach is harmless.\n \n I think it's safe to say though that more are known about the JWs and Mormons than Wiccans, even the encyclopedia has info to verify about them. Who knows for sure that a person is only going to use magic for good? I've known of some hypnotists who've raped woman, my dad knew a guy who got revenge on a school bully using a WeeGee board, my fiancee used to attend spiritualistic meetings until the leaders who were \"posessed\" demanded that the woman have sex with them (they claimed that the spirits told them).\n \n \n Ps, here's just ONE interesting quote I copied from a weegee board forumn:\n \n \"I really do not reccommend using a weegee board. Please take my advice as i am only concerned for your safety because of what happened to my good friend james. We set it all up right and we started doing it and it took a while for anything to start happening but when it did it told us that it was an evil spirit. We thought it was a cool idea to keep playing until james put his finger on the glass and at that moment he rolled his head back and the glass shattered and then he gargled blood. Then he went into a spasm and with the 3 blows with his own hand to his head he made his skull collapse and killed himself. The ortopsy showed that the brain had detached from everything. Me and my friend have spent the last 6 months of our lives in a mental hospital only being released because we decided to stop trying to tell the truth.\"\n \n \n There are plenty more unpleasant experiences like this one from dabbling with spirits.\n \n Does that sound safe and harmless to you?",

   "I don't see what hypnotism has to do with magic, and more particularly what it has to do with Wicca. Similarly I'm not aware of any connection between Wicca and the sort of engagement with spirits that you describe. For most Wiccans, \"magic\" is largely indistinguishable from what you or I might consider to be prayer, and certainly the ritual actions are little more than a committed catholic might undertake. Obviously this will vary from Wiccan to Wiccan, as there is no fixed definition of what Wicca is or how it is practised.

The prohibitions on divination are limited, not wholesale, indeed there are instances in the Bible of divination being used with God's apparent approval, and in any case not all Wiccans practise any form of divination.",

   "I don't see what hypnotism has to do with magic, and more particularly what it has to do with Wicca. Similarly I'm not aware of any connection between Wicca and the sort of engagement with spirits that you describe. For most Wiccans, \"magic\" is largely indistinguishable from what you or I might consider to be prayer, and certainly the ritual actions are little more than a committed catholic might undertake. Obviously this will vary from Wiccan to Wiccan, as there is no fixed definition of what Wicca is or how it is practised.

How else would real magic happen without supernatural intervention?\n \n What else would you describe hypnotism as, other than a magic act? \n \n Wiccans practice magic, there's the connection.

   "Yes. Most definitely. Mankind has done this prior to Christ and does it today among all non-Christian people throughout the world. Our greatly improved civility toward each other othe the last century or so- abolition of slavery, consideration of civil rights, women's rights, etc - has had much less to do with religion than secular thought. \n To paraphrase the Sam Harris article posted by Simone and electolyte, if one does not understand that cruelty to others is bad beforehand, he won't learn differently by reading the Bible. \n \n \n Actually the swing in the pendulum toward conservatism and religiosity had been extremely strong in the last 20 years. In any event, I think crime is actually down in the US. \n \n I do not know how you ascribe those issues to lack of religion. Do you think possibly there could be any other causitive factors?\n \n The point is you come from a position that Christianity is good, in fact the sole source of good. So you have convinced yourself that all bad is due to lack of same. I am not sure there is even a statistical association with the things you describe, much less any evidence of causation. \n \n \n \n Sure. But there are oodles of others ways, too, and the don't come with all the \"side effects\" of christianity, like bad-haired televangelist crooks. \n \n \n \n I have people literally come to my door on Saturday mornings, but they are merely a nuisance. I have battled anti-gay ballot initiatives from religious nuts who have wanted to pass laws that say that being gay is \"wrong\" (seriously, I live in Oregon), and have tried (some successfully) to deprive me of rights that others have, and do it in the name Jeesus.\n \n \n EZ and his ilk regularly claim that I am immoral because I don't believe the same. \n \n \n Not you, cause you're a white, straight, christian male. So you don't see a problem. Isn't christianity supposed to make you selfless and look to the plight of others?\n \n \n Have you read anything the christians write on these forums?\n \n \n Look, if you act like an as$hole and someone gets upset and calls you on it, you ought to be on the defensive. You christians started it, and you act all wounded when others aren't going to take your XXXX any more. That's as respectful as I can get in response to that baloney.\n\n \n \n Well goosy moosy, how would you know I am straight ? I just love it when you get all prissy with me. :) \n \n \n I have stated on here I was a believer. I do not recall saying on here that I was a christian, that is a word that is used too loosely in our culture now. Just because a person claims themselves to be a christian, does not make it so. Remember always when dealing with people and the words they speak or type , the old cliche' , \" The fruit falleth not far from the tree\". .. \n \n Take a hint from this newly appointed a$$hole and save your heart from getting so stressed out. When a person puts a post in \"quote\" the reply is being addressed to that poster being quoted. In this case I was speaking to Georged, not you . But I have enjoyed your insightful response though...\n \n I have read more posts on here than you would think Mr.Moose. After all, I have been on here two years longer than you so that affords me more veiwing time already. I am not a intellectual as you, but I do read the posts on here. I do not feel the need to \"puff\" up on a religion BBS and post a lot. Life is too short for me now, to spend my time trying to convince people of something they choose to deny.. \n \n Your reply validates what I said in my first post.

Do not feel too badly about that though, you are among millions upon millions people that live that way. There is nothing wrong with that, it is your choice and we have all been given free will to choose as we want. ...\n \n It is sad that you cannot be still within yourself long enough to know there is a consciousness greater than you , in your fleshly mind. A consciousness that could change your whole perspective on life . A consciousness that would allow you to dedicate your intellect and time posting more positive data on the net, like how to catch the biggest bass in the lake.

Maybe it's the distance from heaven to earth that is responsible for the breakdown in communication. For example when he communicates with the Middle East it is in the form of Islam. When communicating with Israel, he's Jewish. When communicating with the Vatican, he's Jesus and Jesus is a Jew, but at the same time he's Cathlocism personified. Shall we continue? When communicating with India it gets even better as he splits himself into a multitude of gods. Sort of like the blessed trinity, but then again, sort of not!\n Before you throw your bitter sarcasm at those who do not believe in the supernatural, you need to figure out why the others that do believe in the supernatural believe in different gods then you do. If you all put your heads together maybe you could come up with something called the \"truth\". And when that doesn't happen, maybe you'll realize that everyone is entitled to their beliefs. One person's invisible god, does not pull rank over another person's invisible god, nor can one person's invisble god pull rank over a person who chooses to believe in no god at all. For many years people have been trying to put their invisible gods over the invisible gods of others, and it causes grief, isolation, exclusion, war, and of course death. Unfortunately the human suffering due to the ferverent belief of invisible gods is all too plain to see.",

Besides, this post isn't about proving that spirits do exist.\n \n What you have to ask yourself before you simply dismiss these \"preposterous\" claims is: \n \n What are the sources motives? \n \n If they are just fairytale stories, what's the point in so many people making them up and making themselves look mad? \n \n No-one lies without good reason. The fact is that some people are actually troubled by spirits! It's not like they're just telling an exaggerated scary \"ghost\" story to their friends around the camp fire; they literally are scared to death and want help! Help which is available. And don't just jump to the conclusion that these people were \"mentally mad\", it would be just too much of a coincidence how the problems only raised when the user started getting involved in spiritism...and vanished when they abolished anything to do with it.\n \n Many Wiccans refer to themselves as witches...how is the statement that a lot of Wiccans practice magic preposterous??? It looks like you need to do some real research instead of listening to \"gossip\" from your so called Wiccan friends.",

   "It only works on interesting people...hehe\n\n \n Personally, I'd say it only works on liars.\n \n As to some topics of this thread...\n As a cultural catholic (been up to confirmation), I have not nor ever 'worshiped Mary' nor have I ever been instructed to do so nor have I ever seen nor heard someone else do so.\n There have been subcults of mary worshipers much as there was the protestor reformationist break away, schisms and a host of other abberations associated to the Church, that does not mean that the 'body' or majority follow those offshoots.\n \n Most often, erronous information of this nature is perpetuated by protestor lies and simple ignorant people.\n The Hail Mary prayer is a prayer of intercession. Personally, I find the logic in it to be odd when compared to scripture, after all, what need a believer have to ask someone else for prayers of help when we should just ask God ourselves.\n \n As to followingthe whole bible. That's just silly. Most who claim to do so, or say they are Full Bible believers often mangle it for their own purposes. Taking quotes out of context, ignoring anything that contradicts with their goals. Extrapolating simple verse and comments to often outrageous endings.\n \n Also the bible is contradictory. How the heck are you to follow something such as your 'disfellowship' as stated to the Corinthians IIRC when the Christ taught that a good shepherd would go after that lost sheep, leaving the flock behind.\n Think really hard, were you cut off from your cult (and disfellowship is common cultic control practice) after they really made a concerted effort to win you back and show you the error of your ways or, did they fairly quickly let you go with little efforts? I don't personally know your situation but most often from my experience, it's the latter that happens.\n Public snubbing and other immature behavior is often the result done in the name of disfellowship.\n \n I'm also curious if you'd be willing to sell all your belongings and turn them over to church authorities and live communally? \n I know Word of Faithers would love for you to do so, so would many Pentacostals. Evangelists. Jim Jones had many of his followers do so too. They all said they were FULL bible believers. Odd that that is very abused to exhault the 'man of gawd' with lavish wealth as the followers go wanting. Even Catholicism had such practices.\n \n Psersonally, I say the bath water needs tossing out. The baby drowned in it a long time ago. Do away with it. Religion, Christianity, the whole sheebang. What ever good has been done it it's name is small compared to the harm it's done. I say let humanity fight and kill for unvarnished reasons. Naked greed, limited resources, xenophobia and simple misunderstanding. \n \n \n \n PS. In the event of this made up rapture thingy,\n \n I'm killing those left behind.\n \n Starting with those who professed to be 'Christians'.\n \n emoticon_xangel",

How about people living in remote areas who have never heard of Christianity, let alone Jesus? You might say that they all have an opportunity as we have explored most of the world, but how about those who lived a few hundred years ago - the native peoples of the Amazon and the Congo before the Americas were ever visited or known about by Christians?
