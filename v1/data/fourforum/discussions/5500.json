   "http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=13664\n \n \n People across the world are basically the same, vaniety and consumerism are stronger then any religion or ideology.\n \n \nIranian women may be obliged to wear the chador - literally meaning tent - or otherwise a long coat and headscarf whenever they head outdoors, but that has not dampened their appetite to pamper themselves.\n \n \n \"I do it because it makes me feel good,\" says Simin, a housewife and mother of two in her mid-30s.\n \n \n \"It is in a woman's nature, she wants to look beautiful,\" explained hair stylist Farideh Yasami, busy applying streaks of red and blonde dye into another client's hair that will also never see the light of day.\n \n snip\n \n According to trader Ardavan Babai, sales of cosmetics and Western fashions are one of Iran's biggest retail opportunities, with the Iranian market continuing to lure big-name lipstick, powder and paint manufacturers from Europe.\n \n \n \"Cosmetics are a part of every woman's shopping basket. Even the teenagers know how to apply discreet but flawless make-up,\" he said.\n \n \n \"Our suppliers have even modified their publicity to conform to the Islamic code,\" he said, pointing to a perfume advert devoid of the usual semi-naked model.\n \n \n Elsewhere in Tehran, trendy fashion and lingerie stores are also appearing, despite occasional raids by Islamist militiamen - who still try in vain to stop headscarves from slipping back and coats from getting too colourful\n \n snip\n \n Fitness clubs have also mushroomed across the wealthier parts of Tehran, and another bizarre boom from behind the veil is that of cosmetic surgery.\n \n \n Doctor Abdollah Abbasi, one of Iran's busiest plastic surgeons, says he has performed some 14,000 operations in the past nine years - ranging from minor facelifts to nose jobs, breast enlargements and liposuction\n.",
