You're not \n 9 making that argument?\n MR. GURA: No, Your Honor, the fact is that \n 11 we can always debate these things, but the object of the \n 12 Bill of Rights is to remove certain judgments from the \n 13 legislature, because we can make policy arguments, \n 14 normative arguments about many provisions of the \n Constitution.

Maybe you can understand my line of reasoning. \n \n Like Don Quixote we go about fighting windmills, rather than address the Real Problem. We would rather blame the object rather than the person. Therefore, there still exist a segment of our people, especially some dysfunctional mass murders, who have received the impression that it is OK to take out their frustrations and disappointments at the point of a gun, or a knife, or what is worse, with bombs. Why do they still exist, because we refuse to do Anything to help these people. We have also raised a sub culture where gangs socialize some of our country's precious youth. In these instances, the gang has replaced the family and society's norms and mores, with the norms and morays of the gang leadership. \n \n This is clearly not a legislative problem, it is a Social Problem. If your goal is to truly cure our crime problem, and that is my goal, we cure sick people with Doctors, and we cure the dysfunctional with behavior modification. Not Gun Control! How can Gun Control cure anyone? If we were to ban every gun, bottle, knife, rock, bowling ball etc. from the planet the Dysfunctional will just use something you have not yet banned. They will beat the hell out of us with a baseball bat or a golf club, or perhaps blow us up with something we cannot ban like gasoline or propane. Perhaps they will start throwing acid, or poisoning us. How can gun control cure one person? It cannot. England has proven that even if guns are totally banned the criminals will just import them in with their drugs. Canada's problems with licensing and registration has proven to be a nightmare where Police complain about cost effectiveness and say the money would have been better spent on more policemen. The Citizens are angry and the Government officials are fighting the liberal government because of unbelievable cost overruns. The only thing gun control does is satisfy the Anti-gunners lust for the destruction of the 2nd Amendment, and to take guns away form Law Abiding people, but not the criminals. \n \n The only thing that will cure this societal problem is if we change what is in the hearts and minds of man. We need to do a better job of socializing our youth, making sure none of them slip through the cracks. We need to teach our people right from wrong. To ignore this simple truth is sheer folly. If you say you want to stop the senseless gun violence and do not work to change what is in the hearts and minds of men you are guilty of everything you accuse the Pro-gunners of being. If you only work to remove guns from our Law Abiding will we be any safer? \n \n Prohibition was a total flop. As a matter fact, it caused one of the most violent times in our history. The Gang wars of the Roaring Twenties. Now look at the violence that Drugs are causing? We are already aware of the fact that the U.S. Government cannot prevent drugs from coming into this country even for ten minutes. How long have we been fighting this war on Drugs? For over thirty years, and drugs are as prevalent than they ever have been. Given these examples, I am absolutely sure that we all are aware that there will be 10,000% availability of illegal guns for any Rapist, Predator, Criminal, and Thug who wants one, or even a dozen more to sell. Plus, if all firearms are illegal, and if one were to illegally obtain a gun, why not own and use automatic weapons, just like the gangs in England are using? What would be the logical reason to own a single shot weapon? They both are illegal! The only people who will be disarmed will be the Law Abiding citizen who are not the problem. We will be defenseless! No, the truth is, this fight that they wage is against our Constitution, and not about crime! This is about the Permanent destruction of the law abiding American Citizen's legal right to Keep and Bear Arms. Period! They hate our Second Amendment privileges, and the radical Anti-gun people will NEVER stop. \n \n Question: if your spouse or perhaps one of your children were about to meet one of these dysfunctional's, or a newly socialized gang member, would you hope that the Dysfunctional came from a Brady Gun control rally or would you dearly hope he came from a Psychiatrists office? \n \n The question is, do you really want crime control or just only gun control because guns hurt your sensibility, and hang the Constitution? Crime will never be cleaned up until we as a society do the hard work of proper socialization. To ignore this fact is sheer folly!\n \n Groups Link Media to Child Violence - ABC News\n \n   Nigeria: CLO Wants Onitsha Arms Dealer Probed  \n THE Civil Liberties Organisation, CLO, in Anambra State has called for full investigations into the recent arrest of one Mr. Martin Anokwara over alleged smuggling of about 100,000 ammunitions and a gun valued at over N6 Million into the country.\n",

They will beat the hell out of us with a baseball bat or a golf club, or perhaps blow us up with something we cannot ban like gasoline or propane. Perhaps they will start throwing acid, or poisoning us. How can gun control cure one person? It cannot. England has proven that even if guns are totally banned the criminals will just import them in with their drugs. Canada's problems with licensing and registration has proven to be a nightmare where Police complain about cost effectiveness and say the money would have been better spent on more policemen. The Citizens are angry and the Government officials are fighting the liberal government because of unbelievable cost overruns. The only thing gun control does is satisfy the Anti-gunners lust for the destruction of the 2nd Amendment, and to take guns away form Law Abiding people, but not the criminals. \n \n The only thing that will cure this societal problem is if we change what is in the hearts and minds of man. We need to do a better job of socializing our youth, making sure none of them slip through the cracks. We need to teach our people right from wrong. To ignore this simple truth is sheer folly. If you say you want to stop the senseless gun violence and do not work to change what is in the hearts and minds of men you are guilty of everything you accuse the Pro-gunners of being. If you only work to remove guns from our Law Abiding will we be any safer? \n \n\n If we shouldn't have gun control because it doesn't change \"the hearts and minds of man\" then we could say we shouldn't have prisons, police, burglar alarms, and door locks because these things also don't change the hearts and minds of man. You're really talking about some kind of utopia in which everyone is good and no one wants to commit crimes. Realistically speaking, until we achieve this utopia gun control will be necessary as well as other crime fighting methods that don't involve changing people's hearts and minds. So back to the real world....",

The problem is that the 2nd Amendment says Shall Not Infringe and yet we granted all of these infringements, and it hasn't stopped. \n \n High profile Federal laws.\n 1.Brady background checks for all handgun buyers, \n 2.institution of the waiting period,\n 3. Making it illegal for anyone under 18 to own or even possess a handgun.\n 4. The President's executive order stopping the importation of many guns,\n 5. Excessive fees and regulations that drove many legitimate gun shop owners out of business.\n 6. The widening of Brady to include background checks from just handguns to include all new firearm purchases. \n 7. Insta Check! \n 8. Additional disqualification's and changes to legal firearms purchases on form 4473, \n 9 Lautenburg.\n 10. and just recently the NICS improvement act!\n \n   The &#8220;Unregulated&#8221; Gun  \n &#8220;Gun Laws of America is 384 pages of just the federal statutes that regulate guns&#8212;more than 88,000 words. Additionally, the associated federal regulations interpreting these laws are even larger. Minimum penalty for a violation is typically 5 years in federal prison for every offense.\n \n It is estimated that there are between 22,000 and 30,000 gun laws on the books in America. Those laws include restrictions on possession, carry, distribution, storage, transfer, manufacture, sale, ownership, importation, use and more. \n\n \n And let us not forget about the two most exhaustive studies ever done on gun control and its effects on violence. \n http://www.4forums.com/political/gun-control-debates/13904-amid-drug-war-mexico-less-deadly-than-decade-ago-3.html#post391173\n \n So Galileo, we are talking about the Constitution. When does all of the taking stop, and shouldn't we make you prove that what you want, will actually work as advertised before we even consider granting you any more of OUR, Constitutionally recognized as Inalienable, and therefore protected Right of We the People? Shouldn't our decision on weather or not to grant you any more infringements be based on provable conclusive data? \n \n Isn't it true you want a whole bunch more without that proof, and you don't care what we think or what we want?
