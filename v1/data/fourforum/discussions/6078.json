   "I've been thinking for a while about evolution and how although in the past there have been many examples of how species have evolved, we don't seem to have the same evolution which occurs in other animals in the present, and even in humans in the past. Many people say it is because we are the top in the food chain. But just because you are the best doesn't mean you can't survive better. \n \n No where in evolution is there any reason to think that a far superior species wouldn't continue to evolve because mutations would still occur. The main thing is though, that the mutations that weren't successful could live on, because nothing else would kill them? So why didn't that happen before? Many say we have dominated the food chain because of our ability to use tools. I disagree, while that may be a part, I think the main reason is our ability to work together. Evolution assumes variation, passing on of genes, and competition. For better or for worse, humans have quit the competition for life, realizing that it is possible to survive among other humans. \n \n The question is is this less competition a good thing? We now have homeless people on the streets and eventually, this world will become overpopulated. We are increasing the lifespan of the general population, and thus making the life of the average person gradually worse, because there are a limited amount of resources. So my question is, do people think that lack of competition will be the ultimate downfall of the human race? Or do you think we will be able to contine to work together to help keep humans alive and well? And then there is the third option that we will begin to be more competitive for life, but that doesn't seem to be a real option because of how far along we are now. I'm sorry if this has been covered before or seems like common sense, but I've been thinking about this for a while and really wondering ever since I posted the thread about humans and animals being the same. Despite the fact that we seem to be at such an evolutionary disadvantage, we continue to be at the top of the food chain and pretty much in charge of the Earth.",

   "Evolution through natural selection requires two things:\n 1. Variation in DNA from generation to generation.\n 2. Fecundity affected by competition for resources and premature death.\n \n The first point occurs continually in all species, including humans. As human numbers increase, the amount of variation in the human \"gene pool\" increases too. The key to the lack of evolution in humans at present is the second point. \n \n Fecundity is a posh way of describing how good an individual organism is at producing offspring that in turn produce offspring. So a frog that lays 10,000 eggs of which 2 survive to lay more eggs, crudely put, has the same fecundity as a human who has two children that grow to adulthood and have children themselves. For selection of the \"fittest\" to occur, some of the population must fail to produce successful offspring because of insufficient food to feed the whole population, because of predation, because of disease etc. In other words there must be influencing factors that lower the fecundity of some, giveng the others the advantage.\n \n In much of the world today (especially amongst rich countries with good social welfare and medical systems), nearly everyone has enough to eat, will enjoy a long life and will raise children (if they choose to have them) to adulthood. As a result there are very few, very weak selection pressures acting upon those populations. As a result there is little, if any evolution occuring within those populations.\n \n As to what the long term affect of this might be, it shouldn't lead to our downfall as the gene pool is constantly growing so we ought to be better protected against any future occurence of large selection pressures upon our species. Also due to greater mobility these days, people from different parts of the world meet and interbreed, rather than just breeding with the next village. This spreads the genetic diversity throughout the world further enhancing our species durability (and further reducing any genetic divergences that could otherwise lead to speciation).\n \n Have I come even remotely close to answering your question?",

   "I was just thinking that although we consider ourselves the best in terms of survivng, what if other animals formed together and tried to kill us? Most likely they would succeed. Remember when the cicadas came out around a year and a half ago? there were enough around the world that they could probably take over entire counties one by one by picking us up and dropping us from really high up. It's not like anyone else would believe that the cicadas were actually attacking the human race even if there were survivors. They have evolved into fast, small, flying animals. All advantages for their survival. We have evolved to rely on each other for and tools (guns, for example) for protection. We really don't have any evolutionary advantages in the entire animal kingdom. The bat even has better eyesight than us, we are not even close to the fastest, we don't have good hearing, we have just lost the instinct that competition is inevitable for survival. We have produced enough food and comfortable living conditions for everyone (well almost everyone).\n \n My question was, what happens when, since the population is rising, it gets so big that we can no longer produce enough food for everyone, when we run out of space on Earth for everyone to live? What then? That would bring back competition for the food and housing that was available, and because no one wants to starve to death could create a big rise in crime, thus subtracting from the work force. If there was not enough food or housing, the people unable to get food would quit their job since there was no food to buy with their money anyway. This would spiral downward until there would most likely be a world war. Of course as long as enough people died, we could then continue with our current living conditions, because the population would be controlled again.\n \n Actually I just thought of this, are wars population controlls? We obviously have an instinct to work together, and when people believe different things and want to impose their will on other countries, they fight over it, thus lowering the population. The worse off everyone is, the more people seem to be dying in wars. Look at Africa, all the poverty and disease, and civil war happening over there. Is that an evolutionary advantage for survival of the species? To control the population, there becomes more competition within the species and although the way we kill isn't the same as in other species, it still acheives the same results. Wars still constitute competition within the species.",

   "Wars still constitute competition within the species.\n\n The question is: To what degree do wars cull out particular genes as opposed to ideas? Another thing to consider is not who is getting killed, but who is being born. Unless, something is done about the niche, it will just get filled again by whoever was decimated. Compare: Germans (hypothetically) settling in the Ukraine versus the US bombing of Hiroshima (which was not then settled by the US). Consistent genetic pressure is really key.",
