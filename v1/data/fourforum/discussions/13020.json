   "Old news now but a study found it to be Demark. Therefore why don't we stop arguing about different political methods and simply follow them?\n \n BBC NEWS | Health | Denmark 'happiest place on earth'\n \n Some further info from wiki\n \n Denmark - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n From the first link\n \n \nMr White, who is an analytic social psychologist at the university, said: \"When people are asked if they are happy with their lives, people in countries with good healthcare, a higher GDP [gross domestic product] per capita, and access to education were much more likely to report being happy.\"\n\n \n What really struck me as interesting was, when reading wiki, I came across \n \n \nDenmark, with a free market capitalist economy and a large welfare state,[4] ranks according to one measure, as having the world's highest level of income equality.\n\n \n Also later in the text\n \n \nDenmark's market economy features efficient markets, above average European living standards,[49][50] and high amount of free trade.\n \n Denmark has a nominal GDP per capita higher than that of most European countries, and 15-20% higher than that of the United States.[51] Denmark is one of the most competitive economies in the world according to World Economic Forum 2008 report, IMD, and The Economist.[52] According to World Bank Group, Denmark has the most flexible labor market in Europe; the policy is called flexicurity. It is easy to hire, fire, and find a job. According to rankings by OECD, Denmark has the most free financial markets in EU-15 and also one of the most free product markets, owning to liberalisation in the 1990s.\n\n \n \nThe Danish taxation system is both broad based (25% VAT, not including excise, duty and tax) and has the world's highest income tax rates (minimum tax rate for adults is 42% scaling to 63%, population average for 2006 was 49.6%).[54]\n\n \n They seem to have their cake and eat it. I have always assumed, clearly now wrongly that low taxes accompanied free markets and vice versa. Why does Demark function so well, Is it simply because the people earn enough to be taxed heavily, or it is because they see that their tax is spent in an efficient manner.\n \n Other points of note were that all college education was free. I am still trying to find information on their healthcare system. \n \n So assuming that we all agree that happiness is as defined in study (which I am sure we won't), what can Denmark teach us?\n \n P.S. Please don't turn this into a thread about cartoons.",

   "The work of Hoppe illustrates pretty plainly that government, especially welfare states, work best for the people of the nations' they govern, when there is relative cultural homogeneity and where immigration is strictly limited.\n \n It saddens me to say that, since fundamentally I believe in the free movement of people globally and multiculturalism of one sort or another, but if you want to run a welfare state, you really need to run it like northern europe's.\n \n To transplant something similar to a huge, diverse country with porous borders like the US would be disastrous. Perhaps the only way to emulate this approach in a large country is to seal the borders by law or by force and then decentralise the government so that these sorts of activities can be undertaken at a state or regional level.",
