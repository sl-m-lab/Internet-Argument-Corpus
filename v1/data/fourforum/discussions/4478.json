I hope those grandparents rot in hell.\n\n \n \n Well I wouldn't go that far, but certainly think that the grandparents and their lawyers should do some MAJOR soul searching...mostly because I think they lost theirs along the side of the road somewhere. Possibly on the gravel drive through the trailer park. (Sorry WV humor there...you'ld only get it if you lived in VA for anytime)\n \n Indeed, to take a child from the ONLY parental figure he has ever known simply out of some misplaced and greedy unfofilled need on the part of the grandparents is inexcusable, to me. \n But what the heck, I already know that if anything were to happen to me my partner, who has raised my son along with me since he was eight years old, would never see him again and my son would be returned to a father who hasn't been a \"Father\" figure since my son was TWO! \n And there's no amount of \"Guardianship\" statements that will EVER change that reality. My son's father retains parental rights, my partner can never gain second parent status in my son's life. Even though she has housed him, clothed him, fed him, educated him...as equally as I have for the past eight years. His father sees him occassionally, when it's convenient for him (my ex), about once a year for about a week or so...but not with any real regularity. \n My son's father, my ex-husband, chose to extract himself from his son's life. He chose to limit visitation of his own free will. Our divorce gives him open and liberal visitation availability, but he chooses not to act upon it. \n \n But if I were to die tomarrow, my son would be shipped off to live with his man and his fourth wife and their six other children. My ex doesn't know who this child is. He hasn't a clue as to his actual interests. He doesn't realize how tallented my son is musically, academically, or in theater. He doesn't know how much performance actually plays into my son's life. \n But my partner who does know him, has raised him, has encouraged his tallents and supported us as a family would legally be cut from my son's life. As if she never existed! \n \n I completely sympathize with the second mother in this. They never thought they would need to put up any kind of gaurdianship for their son. Never in their wildest dreams could either of them have known that the biological mother would have been tragically killed in a moter vehicle accedent. \n \n My question is why should they have had to? \n Why do ANY gay couples HAVE to be forced to make extranious legal arrangements for their children or their partners. A legally married opposite gender couple would NEVER have had to think of doing this. It's AUTOMATIC to leave the child with the other parent. Even if there's no proof showing the surviving parent is even the biological parent. As long as the couple is legally married, being that they are opposite genders, it's simply assumed the surviving parent will continue to raise the child.",

Just in the little time I have been in this forum I have seen a lot of angry responses coming from her direction...... What is the big deal with this 'gay lifestyle' term anyway? It just simply implies a pattern of living that represents a choice they are making in their lives.\n\n you haven't read this thread though have you! We have made it very clear why the term is offensive and you reply with \"what the big deal\"? Either you haven't read the thread, your illiterate, or just mean.\n \n \n Choice? I didn't choose to be gay, in fact I tries to choose to be straight and it didn't work, almost killed me. I choose to come to terms with myself and my sexuality, I didn't choose to be gay.",
