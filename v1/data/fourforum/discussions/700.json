   "I'm thining of a 2 year Presidental term limit. The president should be in \"power\" for two years. \n (Bush has done enough damage in his time, lol, jk)\n \n A term should equal two years. \n A president should be able to serve 4 terms (8 years).\n \n Any ideas of how this could be a bad idea?\n As for all you lazy people out there that don't want to vote that often.... Don't give me that excuse.\n Although one downfall of this could be the constant change in goverment policy: (Other issues apply)\n Example Taxes \n Up - Democrat \n Down - Republican\n (continues up,down,up,down,up,etc....)\n \n \n Always Stay Open Minded",

   "Bad idea. A President running for reelection will spend at least one year campaigning half-time and focusing on the Presidency half-time. Currently, that's one-fourth of the President's term that is spent focusing on reelection. Your system would increase that to one-half. Also, two years might not be enough for a President to prove whether or not he can lead the country well. When the President gets into office, he has to set policies, organize his government to exactly the way he wants it, etc. Then, by the time he's ready to get down to business, he has a few months before he's off to the campaign trail again.",
