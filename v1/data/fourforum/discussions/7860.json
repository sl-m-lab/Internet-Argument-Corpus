   "Prompted from the Refrom Judaism thread, and the various critisms directed at 'cafetaria christians' and the like.\n Originally I admit that I sided with the followers of organised religion (for want of a better word), if you are going to beleive that something is the word of God you can't really go ignoring and adding your own opinions into it and still consider it a valid thing, however I've recently started to wonder if this is really the case.\n \n On one side, organised religion generally promotes its text as being the word of God and as such should not be disected and altered to fit the current popular opinions even if it makes it unpopular. However its almost undeniable given what we see happening today and what we know happened in the past that religion quite often gets twisted to meet its preisthood's political aims. Despite this though, if a work does contain the word of God, except in the case of a contradiction it is surely better to follow it absolutely along with a few odd and unecessary rituals than risk removing divine instruction.\n On top of this there is a also the case where a lot of the work will refer to itself. In the case of the Christian bible, even if some of the things seem perfectly justifiable as lessons for desert living, we still have to accept that if Jesus did something that appears unecessary then it must clearly have some divine importance.\n \n On the other in most cases we are talking about a omnipotent or at least supernaturally powerful being who is considered to interact with people (I can't actually think of any gods from any culture who don't respond to prayers, even if they don't answer them the way people might like). On top of this there is the aforementioned issue of possible alteration and editing in various holy books, and whilst we may err on the side of caution in most cases, we have plenty of examples today of people who would edit sections out of the bible if it were up to them as they are 'clearly added in by some backwards tribesman'. Its certainly posible that this has occured before and some divine instruction has been lost (whether in conflict with the current thinking of the day, or because it made no sense at the time. If God had explained quantum physics to Moses when he handed out the commandements, I doubt we would know about it today). In addition, in practically every example of religion we have, gods seem to have the same sort of morals as humans even if they didn't set them.\n Surely then it is reasonable to use our own knowledge of good and evil as well as logic and critical thinking to work out what is right and wrong, and if we get it wrong it would be up to God to correct us and put us back on the path via vision, dreams, encounter with a preacher, philosopher or friend etc.\n \n The only drawback I can see with the latter course is that, for me at least, it seems to put you on the path toward atheism as you will start to question this supernatural being's existance when you see the vast range of beleifs and ideas of morality that people have. God wanting you to be an atheist is a fairly odd position to take.\n \n But hey...what do you think?",

Not sure I can take the analogy forward really, so I'll invent one of my own.\n I've read numerous books in which magic exists in one form or another, however the differences between the Malaz Empire, Westeros, the Old World and Star Wars are irreconciable. From this and general observations I will not consider them as valid sources of information on the nature of magic.\n \n Partly the thing I'm talking about, the wierd rejection of so much of the doctrines in an attempt to try to get them to merge seems a wierder path of reasoning to take rather than rejecting the whole concepts - especially when the latter seems to fit together better.
