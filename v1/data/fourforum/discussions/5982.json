   "Wow, so far no one's offered a solution. I might as well as well then. \n \n I'm not sure if this works, but maybe someone will reason with me:\n \n The Liar's Paradox is a paradox of self-reference, so that a sentence such as \"This sentence is false\" supposedly refers to its own truth-value. \n \n ai. If this sentence is true, then it is making a false claim about itself and the sentence is false.\n \n aii. If this sentence is false, then it is making a true claim about itself and the sentence is true. \n \n I think that this truth-deciding scheme presupposes that there is some implicit bivalency of true and falsity going on, and that this truth-value must be cashed out in terms of a Tarskian meta-language consisting of sentences ai and aii. \n \n Take this sentence, \"This sentence is true\", as contrast. \n \n bi. If this sentence is true, then it is making a true claim about itself and the sentence is true.\n \n bii. If this sentence is false, then it is making a false claim about itself and the sentence is false.\n \n Again, there's a presumption of bivalency but suddenly there's no vicious circularity of inference and a metalinguistic approach of bi and bii merely confirms the identity claim made in the object language.\n \n In the first place a presumption of bivalency seems to suggest that whatever truth-value we currently have infers its negation, so that if the sentence is false then it is truth, and if it is true then it is false. By making such an unbounded inference it also infers that the consequent of any such material implication is the antecedent of another such inference. \n \n But what we have is a case of a sentence in the object language refering to its own truth-value in that object language, rather than a sentence in the object language refering to its own truth-value in the meta-language. The truth-value of object language sentences, likewise, does not depend on the truth-value of meta-language propositions about sentences in that object language.\n \n Saying in the meta-language that some sentence x in the object language is true or false should not further imply a further statement in that object language because while the meta-language is about the object language, the object language is not about the meta-language. \n \n Although the sentence \"This sentence is false\" seems like a proposition about an object language sentence, and therefore a meta-language proposition, it must be an object language sentence for there to be any hope of self-referentiality (and thus a problem). \n \n That is why I think that the self-referentiality of such sentences gives Tarskian logicians and their ilk such a fit, because all propositions about the object language need to be in a meta-language separate from that object language. Trying to deal with self-referentiality by extending it across two or more languages simply begs the question of how the truth-value of such sentences is to be decided. \n \n I think that the truth of such sentences is better decided by allowing that we may form propositions about a language using that language so long as we do not confuse the propositions of a language game with propositions about those language games, and maintain a proper subject/object distinction insofar as reference is concerned.",

That's why people who want bivalence reject such statements. \n \n \nTake this sentence, \"This sentence is true\", as contrast. \n \n bi. If this sentence is true, then it is making a true claim about itself and the sentence is true.\n \n bii. If this sentence is false, then it is making a false claim about itself and the sentence is false.\n \n Again, there's a presumption of bivalency but suddenly there's no vicious circularity of inference and a metalinguistic approach of bi and bii merely confirms the identity claim made in the object language. \n\n I don't see the contrast as meaningful. You seem to be arguing that some self-referential \"statements\" don't cause problems, and might be allowed. There are several reasons to not want to do this. \n \n (1) How do you know which ones to allow? For example, consider \"statement\" A which says: \"Statement B is false.\" Should we allow \"statement\" A or not? If statement B is: \"There are more than ten characters in this statement,\" then we can allow statement A, and conclude that A is False (since B appears to be True). However, suppose \"statement\" B says: \"Statement A is True.\" Can we allow A and B? If A is True, then B is False, then A is False. If A is False, then B is True, then A is True. A can neither be True nor False: something bivalence can't allow. In general, such dependencies can be quite difficult to spot. Do you have mechanism ready to decide what to reject?\n (2) Rejecting all self-referential \"statements\" (\"statements\" referring to statements) is the standard treatment. Once you have your handy dandy mechanism needed to solve the issues in (1), you're ready to go. Unfortunately, you'll be going it alone. Nobody else has your mechanism, and are probably unwilling to even try it, due to the fact that a much simpler approach already exists (i.e., disallow all of them), and is being used quite nicely, thank you.\n (3) Purely on aesthetical grounds, I don't like the allowance of one \"statement\" while another one that has the same feel is being disallowed.\n \n \nIn the first place a presumption of bivalency seems to suggest that whatever truth-value we currently have infers its negation, so that if the sentence is false then it is truth, and if it is true then it is false. By making such an unbounded inference it also infers that the consequent of any such material implication is the antecedent of another such inference. \n\n I have to say, after reading this several times: I don't understand. \n \n \nBut what we have is a case of a sentence in the object language refering to its own truth-value in that object language, rather than a sentence in the object language refering to its own truth-value in the meta-language. The truth-value of object language sentences, likewise, does not depend on the truth-value of meta-language propositions about sentences in that object language. \n\n Huh? \n \n \nSaying in the meta-language that some sentence x in the object language is true or false should not further imply a further statement in that object language because while the meta-language is about the object language, the object language is not about the meta-language. \n\n \"Should not further imply a further statement in that object language\"? What do you mean: \"imply a further statement\"? I'm not following at all.\n \n \nAlthough the sentence \"This sentence is false\" seems like a proposition about an object language sentence, and therefore a meta-language proposition, it must be an object language sentence for there to be any hope of self-referentiality (and thus a problem). \n\n The \"statement\" is neither a valid object language statement nor a valid meta-language statement. Meta-language statements can't be self-referential either. \n \n \nThat is why I think that the self-referentiality of such sentences gives Tarskian logicians and their ilk such a fit, because all propositions about the object language need to be in a meta-language separate from that object language. Trying to deal with self-referentiality by extending it across two or more languages simply begs the question of how the truth-value of such sentences is to be decided. \n\n I don't think meta-languages are causing any difficulty whatsoever. In fact, you have the story quite backwards: Meta-languages isolate propositions to a single language. If you are working in one language, there is no need to worry about what is happening in another language.\n \n \nI think that the truth of such sentences is better decided by allowing that we may form propositions about a language using that language so long as we do not confuse the propositions of a language game with propositions about those language games, and maintain a proper subject/object distinction insofar as reference is concerned. \n\n Well, once again, I have to say: I'm not following you. Do you have some examples to illustrate your suggestion?",

It really is very difficult to get anywhere. Then again, I suspect most people don't want to get anywhere. I am not keen to address each of your \"points\", since you have not addressed mine in any sort of noticeable fashion.\n Disallowing all self-referential statements is fully effective. You have shown zero advantage by allowing some statements. Also as far as I can tell, you have not provided a mechanism to show which statements (groups of statements) should be disallowed.\n Your suggestion that what other people do is \"neither here nor there\" is erroneous. I could just as well suggest that we call the symbol 7 by the name \"nine\" and the symbol 9 the name \"seven\". I think we should do this, because 7 is used more often than 9 is, and we might as well take advantage of the fact that \"nine\" is few characters and is only 1 syllable. There is a cost in changing how things work; the benefits must outweigh the cost. You have shown zero benefits, and as there is a cost, I can't see why change should be considered. This is especially true, since you haven't fully specified what the change would be. I'm still looking for the mechanism. Please provide it.\n \n \n \nLikewise I would think that a more effective approach would be preferable to a simpler yet less effective approach that ignores the problem instead of dealing with it.

If A2 is making a false claim about A1 then A2 is false. \n\n \n I'm sorry: exactly where did this get us? I already said that. You are wasting my time by \"analyzing\" what I say, and posting the same conclusion as mine. You are wasting my time by showing B and C, since they don't address A. (It should be obvious that I already understand the theoretical existence of B and C.) I implore you: Please stick to some kind of logical path. Answer the questions put to you: What are we supposed to do with A1 and A2? In general, how do we figure out which statements are \"problems\"? Or do we not need to figure out which statements are problems?\n \n You seem to be saying a \"mechanical solution\" is possible, but you have not definitized it. Since you have chosen to not address the general question of how to decide what is a problem, please consider the following statements:\n (1) If Riemann's Hypothesis (RH) is correct, then statement (3) is False.\n (2) If RH is incorrect, then statement (4) is False.\n (3) Statement (1) is True.\n (4) Statement (2) is True.\n \n If RH is False, we have the following:\n (1) is vacuously True. \n (3) is True. \n However, if (2) is True, then (4) is False, but then (2) has be False. \n If (2) is False, then (4) is True, but then (2) has be True.\n PROBLEM.\n \n If RH is True, we have the following:\n (2) is vacuously True. \n (4) is True. \n However, if (1) is True, then (3) is False, but then (1) has be False. \n If (1) is False, then (3) is True, but then (1) has be True.\n PROBLEM.\n \n Therefore, if RH is True, then one set of statements is a problem. If RH is false, then a different set of statements is a problem. The rub is that nobody knows whether RH is True or not, or even whether the truth of RH can be known. This being the case, what \"mechanical solution\" do you propose?",

Let's return to the Liar's Paradox (LP): \"This statement is false.\" Assuming truth-functional means: whether a given statement is true or false depends on whether its basic parts are true or false, what are the basic parts? LP seems indivisible. So don't you need to come up with the truth value for LP? Having done that, you can then map it (functionally) onto some other truth value. Are you implying that the functional-truth value be the negation of the truth value of the atom itself? And if so, then aren't we left with one of two possibilities, both of which say that the statement (in some fashion) is both and false? I'm probably not following what you intend, however I do not see having two truth values (especially differing truth values!) to the same statement buys me anything. There does not seem to be a compelling reason to want to do anything other than just eliminate self-referential statements.",

   "toby:\n \n I do know how to use the quote function and I prefer not to use it. It has been my experience these past years that such use of the quote function interferes with communication rather than facilitates it. Better, I think, to write a coherent message rather than addressing points individually and out of context. I, for one, would certainly prefer that you address the substance of my post rather than the components through which I express it. If we cannot do this together, then I suggest we drop this discussion. \n \n Moreover if I repeat myself, it is in the hope that I haven't been sufficiently clear and some judicious rephrasing of my point will get it understood. Obviously we are both trying to understand each other, but I suspect that we do not share enough background on the subject to make ourselves easily understood. In particular it might help to know that I'm trying to figure out an alternative solution to simply disallowing self-referential statements. \n \n As for handling the Liar's Paradox with a meta-language, that is precisely what I am trying to avoid. As I understand these things, meta-languages were proposed by Alfred Tarski as a method for handling truth and my reading on the subject is pretty much limited to excerpts from his paper \"The Semantic Conception of Truth and the Foundations of Semantics\". My remarks about meta-languages were concerned with distancing myself from Tarski's conception of truth while I demonstrated a method like that of appealing to a meta-language to explain how the truth-value of such sentences may be established. \n \n Tarski, again as I understand these things, disallowed such self-referential statements on the basis of inconsistency in the sentences of such \"semantically closed languages\", and the antimony involved in the Liar's Paradox, so that a meta-linguistic solution for the conditions of material adequacy could be met for formal languages. I'd like a solution that doesn't require such meta-languages as they face some philosophical issues such as the question-begging that I mentioned. They're certainly effective, I'm not contesting that, but I'd like to see if a solution is possible without the cost of disallowing such sentences as the Liar's Paradox. \n \n Back to the Liar's Paradox. As you mention it does not seem to be divisible into component propositions. Yet we seem to be able to construct a sentence about the truth-value of other predicates such as the traditional \"Snow is white\". For Tarski this would be a meta-linguistic construction unavailable for use with such a sentence as \"This sentence is false\". \n \n By my solution such a construction is moreso a decomposition of the sentence into its truth-value and its subject, which is about its truth-value in the Liar Paradox and similarly self-referent sentence. We can then place these two components of each sentence into a formalized relation to each other which resembles a truth-table. \n \n As for defining this procedure, I'll get around to it when I get back from colloquium. \n \n Jim's Trucking:\n \n Here's a quote from Alfred Tarski:\nIt should be emphasized that antinomieshave played a preeminent role in establishing the foundations of modern deductive sciences. And just as class-theoretical antinomies, and in particular Russell's antinomy (of the class of all classes that are not members of themselves), were the starting point for the successful attempts at a consistent formalization of logic and mathematics, so the antinomy of the liar and other semantic antinomies give rise to the construction of theoretical semantics.\nI guess all those silly word-games that resulted in the design and invention of computers were a waste of time eh?",

Yes, those are poor reasons, if there is anything significant to be gained. However, if what is to be gained is nothing, then one doesn't need much of a reason to reject the pursuit. I haven't been shown that there is something to be gained. Have you? Let me ask you: Why shouldn't we call 7 by the name \"nine\", and 9 by the name \"seven\". I think we should change them, since the word \"nine\" is easier to say and fewer characters to spell.\n \n I also suggested that the number (1) reason is that the Liar's Paradox is tip of the iceberg (it's really impossible, in general, to determine which groups of statements are paradoxical).

I reject it, because I want bivalence, and I want simplicity if there is no great cost to having simplicity. There is a cost to not allowing as a valid proposition: \"This sentence has fewer than ten characters in it.\" But I can always make a valid proposition: The following sentence has fewer than ten characters in it: \"This sentence has fewer than ten characters in it.\" The issue is cost versus benefit. It is much simpler to just not allow self-referential statements. There cannot exist a mechanism that can decide which groups of statements are paradoxical.",

   "Mach: \n \n Going back and reading Tarski it seems that he rejects the Liar Paradox, and other similar antinomies, because languages that include them are semantically closed (includes expressions, names of expressions, and truth-value terms) and thus prone to inconsistency. \n \n More accurately then my claim should have been that a meta-linguistic hierarchy of languages begs the questions as to how truth may be decided because it seems that for every meta-language you would need a supervening meta-language to check the truth of truth-claims. So it's not really his truth-definition that is quesiton begging so much as his decision method, the use of meta-languages, seems to be. What I'm suggesting here is that Tarski's solution to the problem of the definition of truth may be problematic. Maybe I'm wrong, but that seems to be one of the standard objections to his solution. \n \n The relevance of whether a self-referencing system of sentences (the Liar's Paradox being a system of one self-referencing sentence) may have its truth-value decided seems to be that if such a sentence can have its truth-value decided then it is a well-formed sentence and ought not to be rejected. \n \n Tarski argued that the truth-value of these sentences could not be decided, and that therefore they were not well-formed due to inconsistency of the systems that they are formed in. The paradox, or antinomy, seems to be indicative of a badly formed sentence, and by extension the result of an inconsistent languages such as a semantically closed one. \n \n Working backwards Tarski's reasoning seems to be that if we disallow inconsistent languages we must disallow semantically closed languages, and by extension any sentences formed under the conditions that semantically closed sentences allow such as self-referential sentences like the Liar's Paradox. \n \n From what I can tell, my solution suggests that semantically closed languages are not as problematic as Tarski argues they are if we can maintain a distinction between subject and truth-value predicated of the subject when constructing such a language. I think that in his analysis of the Liar's Paradox (\"7. The Antimony of the Liar\") Tarski confuses the subject of the sentence, itself, with its truth-value. My solution then is to analyze the subject and truth-value separately to show that no antinomy follows from the sentence's self-reference. \n \n Tarski's analysis goes something like this.\n \n There is a sentence 's' that says 'Sentence 's' is false' \n \n Using the convention '(T) X is true if and only if, p' we construct the following: \n \n (1) 's' is true if and only if sentence 's' is false. \n \n Given the meaning (reference) of the symbol 's' we establish the following empirical fact:\n \n (2) 's' is identical with the sentence in question printed in this [post]. \n \n Using Leibniz's law from the theory of identity in conjunction with (2) we may replace the expression [sentence 's'] with the symbol 's' and obtain the following:\n \n (3) 's' is true if, and only if, 's' is false. \n \n The huge problem I have with this, and I hope I'm mistaken, is the subtle bait-and-switch that Tarski pulls with the sentence in question. Sentence 's' is \"Sentence 's' is false\" and not \"Sentence 's'\" so (1) should state:\n \n (1r) Sentence 'Sentence 's' is false' is true if, and only if, sentence 'Sentence 's' is false'' is false.\n \n Now the supposition of identity again:\n \n (2r) The sentence 'Sentence 's' is false' is identical to 's'. \n \n Replacing the sentence in question with its name we have:\n \n (3r) Sentence 's' is true if, and only if, sentence 's' is false. \n \n Tarski says that (3/3r) is an obvious contradiction. He seems to think that (3) means: 'True if and only if false' when it should be interpreted as 's1 if and only if s2 where s1 is true and s2 is false'. This works well for other sentences that work out as 'True if and only if true', and is never an isssue for sentences that work out as 'False if and only if false' because we're testing for truth. \n \n I think Tarski is confusing the propositions in question (sentence 's') with the truth-values predicated of them. To me it just looks like a biconditional statement of the form Ts [if and only if] Fs, the aggregate truth-value of which is false. \n \n Of course, I'm just saying what I think Tarski is saying after some casual close-reading. \n \n So that's basically my mechanical solution, to lay such systems of sentences out in a table according to the properties predicated of them (usally truth) and decide the value that way instead of working from material adequacy.",
