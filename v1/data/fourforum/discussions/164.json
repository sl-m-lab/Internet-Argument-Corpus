   "Why the Opposition from Our Supposed Allies\n \n Some people have tried to make the bogus claim that the U.S. built Iraq's chemical and biological weapons systems. Some have claimed that the U.S. is more concerned about its economic interests than a bio-terror event. People around the world seem to be questioning the motives of my government, while giving the naysayers a pass, without scrutiny. The purpose of this post is to provide a balanced look at the interests in play regarding the Iraqi situation.\n \n I will warn you now; countries like Germany, France, China, and Russia have put their economic interests above the bio-terror threat. Sometimes they largely share in the responsibility, being the primary engineers of the NBC (Nuclear Biological and Chemical) threat. Most of the opposition in the Security Council is a result of protecting a country's own economic gains in dealing with the Iraqi despot. Most of these countries benefit greatly from the weapons and oil trade ongoing in Iraq, and most of these countries should be lumped into the category known as the axis of evil. \n \n Our sovereignty does not lie in the hands of a failed world government comprised of countries whose interests align with the enemies we seek to destroy. Hopefully, the following accounts will give you an idea about the complex political maneuvering and intense struggle the world is about to face. Some remain undecided, because they would like to get a general indication of who will prosper and who will fail in this newly emerging world war. The dynamics of the world is about to change.\n \n I would be more concerned over  Germany's connection to Iraq than America's. Their socialist government has strained the diplomatic relationship it has taken over fifty years to create. It seems that the prospect of large profit margins has skewed the thinking of the German people. Once again America finds itself at odds with Gothicism.\n \n China, no doubt, is at the heart of tensions between the United States and others. The following details will give some explanation for their reservations about the Iraqi war. Wouldn't it be suicidal to seek the permission of a nation that has threatened to nuke our West Coast? I wouldn't be surprised to find out that China was directly sponsoring al Qaeda.\n \n In November 2000 Foreign Minister Tang Jianxuan held talks with Iraqis Deputy Prime Minister where he expressed interest in expanding \"friendly cooperation with Iraq in the political, cultural, trade, economic and other areas, intensify mutual visits at various levels and further promote bilateral economic and trade ties between China and Iraq, in particular.\"\n \n Source: http://www.iraqwatch.org/government/China/china-mfa-11-27-00.htm\n \n \"China sells Iraq weapons systems: its fibre optic cables underpin Iraq's air defenses. Russian companies now profit from the absence of competition in Baghdad. France has a long and continuing history of ingratiating itself with Saddam's regime. If any of them blocks a swift resolution, it will stand condemned.\"-Tom Minchin\n Melbourne, Australia\n \n Source: http://www.guardian.co.uk/letters/story/0,3604,800595,00.html\n \n China has also helped beef up Iraq's missile technology. This missile fuel deal only scratches the surface of Chinese ties to Iraq.\n \n Source: http://www.washtimes.com/national/20021016-81068264.htm\n \n North Korea's newly found missile range is no coincidence. China also had a hand in new tensions on the Korean Peninsula.\n \n Clearly, France does not come out smelling like a rose. More accurately, they smell like Pepe Lew Pew. Considering the headache we have endured when dealing these snobby people, the following comes as no surprise:\n \n \"Last year, France ranked No. 1 among European countries doing business with Iraq, with $1.5 billion in trade, followed by Italy, with $1 billion. Among the countries that trade with Iraq under the oil-for-food program, France ranked third, with $3.1 billion in trade since the program's start 1996. French trade under the program was surpassed only by Russia, with $4.3 billion, and Egypt, according to United Nations diplomats.\"\n \n Gee, I see that it is only U.S. capitalism that you left-wing pinkos are capable of criticizing. If I were looking to indict capitalism, I would cite cases like French oil giant TotalFinaElf's economic interests in Iraq, and how France's economic policy presents a dangerous threat to the rest of the world. By partnering up with a madman, France once again aligns itself with a Hitlerian madman.\n \n France has done more to help with Iraqi weapons, and in more of a deliberate way. I find the following account to be very disturbing:\n \n \"In March, Nabel Musawi of the London-based Iraqi National Congress told ABC News that Baghdad bought seven refrigerated trucks from Renault Trucks, the French company that is owned by Volvo of Sweden, and converted them into biological arms laboratories\"\n \n Source: NY Times\n \n For all of the talk you leftist allocate to the importance of international law, I find it funny that none of you appear concerned over Russia and China breaking Iraqi embargoes for the purpose of selling weapons technology.\n \n Source: BBC News\n \n As far as biological weapons are concerned, I would be far more concerned about the vaccine-resistant strains of smallpox coming out of Corpus One (Russia), than I would about the U.S. program that was killed about thirty years ago. The prospect of Ebolapox is a very frightening development. Reports have surface about Russia creating such a nasty weapon. The Alibekov strain of anthrax was developed by a Russian scientist and is reportedly 4 times deadlier than natural anthrax. The scientists with this know how went to work for rouge nations after the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n \n Source: CNN\n \n Your immature worldview and misplaced concern over the \"evils of America\" seem to ignore the true threats that are amassing in the world. It is no surprise that those countries with economic ties to Iraq are the most outspoken against the prospect of war in Iraq. Sadly enough China, Russia, France, and Germany all have oil and weapon deals with the despotic Saddam Hussein and his regime. \n \n Even more alarming remains the vile nature of the weapons they developed, their lack of concern over the security of their weapons information, and the lack of importance placed on a possible attack with something like ebolapox. What is it going to take for you illiberals to learn that the threat is real. If smallpox is released, there is no telling what rate the disease will spread. The k factor for this agent is unknown. Previous models operate under the assumption that ring vaccination works. With genetic work exposing the virus to the IL-4 gene, there is reason to believe a vaccine will not be effective. The human death toll could surpass anything we have see before in history. Wake up! This is not a partisan, anti-American issue. This is an issue for all humanity, even the vermin on the left. Smallpox will not care that you stuck up for Saddam Hussein as he produced his NBC weapons. You will be dead.",

Germany and France seem to not remember the opression they were once under. So be it... next time someone in Europe invades either I hope we don't help.",
