   "Has any one noticed the Geico's geko has gone from having a posh Brittish accent to an Australian accent?\n\n I noticed a change in voice faster than I noticed a change in accent. I thought it sounded different but a little more subtle different. Maybe they are afraid of their commercials going the way the the Taco Bell commercials. The dog speaking in a Mexican accent apparently offended some people so now they have guys coming out going \"I'M FULL.\" Before long, the Geico people were probibally affraid of offending the British so they changed their accent before they had to impersonate the new Taco Bell commercial by having a guy come out of an out-house going \"I'M EMPTY!\" And then have a doctor saying \"So many people are constapated until they eat at this taco place where the tacos aren't made right anyway. Then have the guy saying \"it cleared me right up.\" Then it could have the doctor saying \"but unfortunately, it won't save you money on car insurance. I'm sorry, that was a blantant attack on Taco Bell. But the last person I heard from who was Mexican said that they aren't made right so it works.",
