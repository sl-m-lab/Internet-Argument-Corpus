   "This is MY thread.\n In it, I will lay out my plans for world domer...er...fixing all the world's problems. \n \n Initially, I'll throw some disjointed ideas out and hopefully, when the lazy's leave me, flesh them out and add to them.\n \n I may even 'edit' from time to time...or even give up and start a new thread with even better ideas (as if...).\n \n For starters, I will start with America. Land of the mooch and home of the exploiter.\n I think it goes without saying that Chicago and Detroit should be destroyed with high yield nuclear warheads. I'm thinking old school dirty bombs in the 20mt range ground burst.\n Those cities are a blight. They are filthy and rife with corruption. The people are worthless and a pox on this arse of thsi good nation.\n Expats of those cities will be arrested and air-lifted...and dropped sans parachute back to their home towns.\n Those who mourn such a loss will be shot.\n \n Yeah, that's a good start.\n \n Next up...I solve the energy problems facing the world.\n Solve hunger\n Bring about world peace\n And a whole lot of other things...\n \n All with the use of high yield nuclear weapons.\n \n It's not like you have to break a few eggs to make an omlet...you have to break ALL of them!\n I'm ambitious like that.\n And it'll be cooked with...\n You guessed it...\n High yield nuclear weapons...",

   "Is this satire suggesting nuclear disarmament?\n \n Anyways be careful wilth solving all the worlds problems, what will we talk about on 4forums?\n\n \n Nope.\n I'd NEVER, EVER, suggest nuclear disamament...what are you? Daft?\n I think them suckers should be used.\n (Preverably on our Nuclear armed enemies and then on our nuclear armed 'allies' and then on anyone who looks at you crazy-like, then on the prime military bases and ports of most nations...then on population centers of about 1 million or more. Left over nukes would be used to carve my name into Eurasia...in Hancock style long-hand lettering. (I have 5 names...and not one of them is Spanish...go figure).\n \n \n Anyway,\n I'm paid to watch the news stations of these and other cities in America...and they deserve to be wiped off the face of the planet.\n They are 100% cesspools. \n \n And the world needs problems solvers and fortunatly for the world, such problem solvers as the likes of me come along occasionally.\n \n For todays problem, I've chosen Congress.\n Both the House and Senate need to have every single member taken to the White house lawn and turned into fertalizer for Mrs Obama's new garden.\n \n Why, I ask, haven't the people of America risen up and changed the way things are done? Constantly the ###### of this nation elect even bigger bafoons and send them to D.C. to cause even more troubles.\n It's almost as if though the states search for the villiage ###### and think that this is a good way to exile them for a time from their communities...little seeing past their own noses that these genetic defects only cause more harm where they end up.\n \n Yep.\n Day 2. Liquidate congress.\n \n And for Day 3, get the executive and judicial branches also.\n \n Ah heck, I've had some caffeine today...so do em all on day 2.\n \n Hows that for energetic problem solving?\n First, you identify the problems and remove them.\n \n Next up, what to place in the vaccum they leave.\n \n Three guesses...I'll give you a hint...his name starts and ends with the same letter.\n And since he's the SOLUTION to all problems...he's like the Omega.",
