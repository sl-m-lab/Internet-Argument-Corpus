   "Bill Moyers Journal, on PBS last night, offered a stinging critique of the media in the run-up days to the Iraqi War. Much of it was not new, but it was very well presented, particularly the discussion with two Knight Ridder journalists who DID pursue the story - proving it WAS there. Their editor: \n \n JOHN WALCOTT: A decision to go to war, even against an eighth-rate power such as Iraq, is the most serious decision that a government can ever make. And it deserves the most serious kind of scrutiny that we in the media can give it. Is this really necessary? Is it necessary to send our young men and women to go kill somebody else's young men and women? http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/btw/transcript1.html\n \n As Moyers lays out relentlessly, there was very little of that kind of scrutiny. The Knight Ridder papers themselves sometimes chose not to run these reporters' pieces because they were not following the herd. And what a herd it was! The New York Times, The Washington Post, all the networks, the cable news, on and on, thump thump thump. Truly disgraceful and frightening in its implications. And the obtuseness continues to this day. CBS on its blog, has Mark Knoller defending the White House Press corps. http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2007/04/26/publiceye/entry2730924.shtml#ccmm The readers comments section then rightly and unanimously tears his arguments to shreds. \n \n In watching this show, it sobered me to the huge importance of the media taking their \"watch dog\" role seriously, how it has been undermined by the money making imperative of the huge media companies, and that the media insiders are too often de facto government insiders gazing at their masters with starry eyes. And what will we do when old war horses like Bob Simon, Walter Pincus and Bill Moyers himself are out to pasture?\n \n All things considered, I'm immensely grateful for the Internet and availiability of the foreign press. \n \n The Denver Post, \" Don't miss this show:\n Bill Moyers' \"Buying the War\" exposes the media's failure to do their job.\"\n http://test.denverpost.com/headlines/ci_5733327\n \n The Seattle Post Intelligencer: http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/tv/312757_tv24.html\n \n Find out when this show is on: http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/about/airdates.html?edit_st=y",

   "WASHINGTON, April 26 - George J. Tenet, the former director of central intelligence, has lashed out against Vice President Dick Cheney and other Bush administration officials in a new book, saying they pushed the country to war in Iraq without ever conducting a \"serious debate\" about whether Saddam Hussein posed an imminent threat to the United States.http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/27/washington/27intel.html?hp\n \n Central to that lack of a \"serious debate\" was a lack of serious watchdog journalism. The press was there part of Bush's preferred \"yes men\", right along with Tenet. \n \n What were they so afraid of? Why didn't he speak out when it might have counted?\n \n JL",
