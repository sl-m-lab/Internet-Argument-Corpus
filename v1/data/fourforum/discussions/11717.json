   "What is a right?\n\n Just for fun and to see where it goes, I'm going to define a right as \"Things other people are obliged to do or permit because you exist\". After all, a 'right to life' does not actually guarantee your survival, or mean that putting your own life in danger is illegal. It merely determines how other people are allowed or obliged to react to you being alive.\n \nCan you justifiably be denied a right?\n\n Yes. If you fail in your responsibilities to the society in which you live, that society may selectively revoke the rights it guarantees for you.\n \nWhat makes a right different from a privilege?\n\n Rights (as well as responsibilities) define what it means to be a citizen in a society. A privilege is something that society isn't obliged to provide on your behalf.\n \nDo all people worldwide have the same rights?\n\n No. It depends upon the sphere of influence within which they live. Often that means their own society, but if society A believes that citizens of society B are being denied rights that society A see as important, A might attempt to expand its sphere of influence to guarantee those rights for citizens of society B.\n \nHow do we get our rights?\n\n By forming a society and agreeing upon the contractual terms between it and its people.\n \n This is all very fast and loose; I want to kick these ideas around with other people rather than try to reach a conclusion right off the bat.",

Comparing today to the 1950's or 1960's shows a completely different medical community. Back then, relieving pain, general surgery, setting broken bones, childbirth etc. was not all that unaffordable, though those things, like today, weren't something that most people could reach in their pocket and pay for when needed with no problem. Coverage for those things were available in most simple private plans. A person with a job sweeping floors could get coverage for his entire family. And he accepted the fact that if he needed to go to the doctor, he had to pay for the office visit on his own. If his daughter wanted breast augmentation, the thought of anyone but him paying for it never entered his mind. There was very little, if any, insurance for prescription drugs. It's not the same today. \n \n In addition to doing a better job of what they were doing in 1960, todays medical community often doesn't mind playing God. Embryonic stem cell research, organ transplants, artificial prolonging of life - the list goes on and on, and it all must be paid for by someone, and it's seldom the one receiving the treatment. Third party payers in anything can easily lead to trouble, as we're now seeing. I couldn't even guess how many multiples above and beyond 1960 is today being paid by third parties for prescription drugs alone. \n \n Things are far from being perfectly rosy in other industrialized countries with some type of government health care. Waiting periods and less-than-hospitable treatment are problems that I've heard of, but there are some drawbacks about it that I can easily see happening. Job loyalty would be one, many people tend to ride out tough times in their job - avoiding changing jobs - so as to not upset their status with their health provider. With health care out of the equation, I can see a lot more job changing going on, a lot more problems with employers having to deal with it all. In my state, part time school bus drivers get free medical insurance, and many do that job only for that reason. With health care no longer an issue, many of them will quit doing that difficult job unless they get a really big raise. Who will pay for that? \n \n Obtaining health care is often a motivation for being a productive citizen. \n \n \nAfter all, what are the alternatives?

That's all I'm saying.\n\n I agree that we shouldn't give people a blank check to comfortably indefinitely live on government expense (except for those that are incapacitated by illness or injury or birth that have no other choice but to depend on the government). However, I think that it is a community responsibility to make sure that the least among us can have at least a bare minimum of life. This includes food and shelter - where I would say that homeless shelters, if properly funded, can supply that support of last resort. Homeless shelters are certainly not comfortable and I can't imagine anyone (outside of the mentally deranged) preferring living indefinitely in homeless shelter compared to the better life they could have if they had a job.\n \n However, I also view community responsibility as needing to make sure that the sick get care. If people can afford health insurance, then I would think that it is their responsibility to pay for it. However, there are those that just can't afford health insurance and, therefore, can't get healthcare outside of going to free clinics (for the minor health issues) or relying on the charity of hospitals (for the major issues). That is where government can help and the subsidy program that Obama proposes seems reasonable.\n \nHe wasn't talking about Parliament, he was talking about the new US Constitution. It's also important to remember what our 10th amendment says;\n \n &#8220;The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.&#8221; \n \n Unlike most people, I don&#8217;t believe they said &#8220;the states respectively, or to the people&#8221; because they were confused about which of the two should decide.

Not the details of them, the entire concept of them. It's too late for the first two, but not yet for universal health care. \n\n We are a Republic, as opposed to a Democracy, for a reason - since people generally do not have the time or the inclination to inform themselves on the details of an issue, they choose representatives whose general views they agree with and let those representatives decide the details. Obviously, Obama's health care program is very popular - at least among Democrats. If it wasn't and if people had major concerns, he would quickly lose votes. In a Republic, our say on major issues are indirect - through votes for candidates that support general issues. If the candidates suddenly change tactics after being elected, then they certainly could be blamed for overstepping their mandate. However, Obama is quite open about his general views on health care. Since he is not losing any votes because of it, it seems that most are in agreement.\n \n Polls support the idea that most people would be willing to have the government help pay for health care through taxes to make sure everyone is insured. From http://www.pollingreport.com/health3.htm :\n \n ABC News/Washington Post Poll. June 12-15, 2008. N=1,125 adults nationwide. MoE \u00b1 3. Fieldwork by TNS.\n \"Which of these do you think is more important: providing health care coverage for all Americans, even if it means raising taxes, OR, holding down taxes, even if it means some Americans do not have health care coverage?\" \n In 6/12-15/08, 66% said \"Coverage for all\", 31% said \"Holding down taxes\", and 3% were unsure. People were even more supportive of \"Coverage for all\" in earlier years.\n \n Quinnipiac University Poll. May 8-12, 2008. N=1,745 registered voters nationwide. MoE \u00b1 2.4 (for all registered voters).\n \"Do you think it's the government's responsibility to make sure that everyone in the United States has adequate health care, or don't you think so?\"\n From the group of all registered voters, 61% thought it was, 35% didn't think so. Among Republicans, 34% thought it was, 62% didn't think so. Among Democrats, 81% thought it was, 16% didn't think so. And among Independents, 59% thought it was, 37% didn't think so.\n \n So, these polls (among the first on that web site) among many others show that most Americans DO support some government help in health care.\n \nI&#8217;ll admit that some type of government health care&#8217;s time has probably come. Comparing today to the 1950&#8217;s or 1960&#8217;s shows a completely different medical community. Back then, relieving pain, general surgery, setting broken bones, childbirth etc. was not all that unaffordable, though those things, like today, weren&#8217;t something that most people could reach in their pocket and pay for when needed with no problem.

If his daughter wanted breast augmentation, the thought of anyone but him paying for it never entered his mind. There was very little, if any, insurance for prescription drugs. It&#8217;s not the same today. \n\n I am glad that you see that there is a problem. Do you see any solution outside of government intervention? Remember, government intervention doesn't necessarily need to mean a complete change to socialized medicine. What Obama is proposing is much different than that. He simply wants to allow those who cannot afford health insurance as it currently stands to buy into a government run program that is subsidized through tax payer money. Those of us who CAN afford health insurance not only continue to have the choices that we currently have, but can also choose (if I understand it correctly) to buy into the government program. It is our choice.\n \nIn addition to doing a better job of what they were doing in 1960, todays medical community often doesn&#8217;t mind playing God. Embryonic stem cell research, organ transplants, artificial prolonging of life - the list goes on and on, and it all must be paid for by someone, and it&#8217;s seldom the one receiving the treatment. Third party payers in anything can easily lead to trouble, as we&#8216;re now seeing. I couldn&#8217;t even guess how many multiples above and beyond 1960 is today being paid by third parties for prescription drugs alone. \n\n If you were severely sick, wouldn't you also want access to the technologies that could prolongue your life? Nevertheless, I understand the idea that, at some point, the country and insurance agencies cannot afford to indefinitely prolongue the life of everyone - costs would skyrocket to the point that very few could afford the insurance. So, some limitations would probably be built into the system.\n \n As for perscription drugs, it gets me angry to see the costs of American drugs compared to the same drugs being bought from other trustable countries (such as Canada). The pharmaceutical industry claims that much of that cost is due to research and development of new drugs. However, I have read that most of what they call an R&D budget is really only market research - ex. contacting doctors directly to try to push their new drug - and that most of the significant new advances in drugs comes from universities funded by government grants (that I fully support). Here is a link with a detailed discussion on this point: http://www.nybooks.com/articles/17244\n \nThings are far from being perfectly rosy in other industrialized countries with some type of government health care. Waiting periods and less-than-hospitable treatment are problems that I&#8217;ve heard of, but there are some drawbacks about it that I can easily see happening. Job loyalty would be one, many people tend to ride out tough times in their job - avoiding changing jobs - so as to not upset their status with their health provider.

With health care no longer an issue, many of them will quit doing that difficult job unless they get a really big raise. Who will pay for that? \n\n If you believe in a free market of any sort, then it is clear that the costs of labor should also have some dependence on the available supply of that labor. People who do difficult or tedious jobs should be properly compensated for them.\n \n That being said, I also do not think that we should limit our health care choices in the US to purely socialized medicine. For those that cannot afford other choices, that might be the only choice. However, there are those that can afford health insurance that doesn't suffer any of the limiations of socialized care, and they should have the right to buy that. I simply think it is important to have a safety net, along with having options. Besides having compassion for the poor, I want to know that I can count on at least a minimum of health care, no matter what happens to me.\n \n Lastly, once again, Obama is not advocating that we all join up in goverment controlled health care. He is advocating that government health care becomes an option - especially for those who cannot afford regular health care insurance, where the health care would be subsidized in their case.",

   "I may be wrong but I think what inspired this thread was Obama's proclamation that health care is a \"right\". If we own ourselves and respect the fact that others own themselves, then it is not. A demand of free health care is a demand that others give up part of their earnings (their time, therefore part of themselves) to provide health care for someone who has not earned it. It's not the intent of the US framers, simple as that.\n\n \n I believe that health care should be a right, the financial road to accessing health care is not an argument for its existence as a right.\n If it were free it would be considered an unequivocal right, however once finance comes into play it then becomes a right for a \"select few\". This is not exactly fair.\n Its like saying its a right depending on the situation.\n Either humans are entitled to the right to access heath care or their not, placing conditionals apon this argument is poor form.\n \n Do we have a right to be educated, my guess is your answer would be only if we pay for it?

The Welfare reforms under the Clinton administration are a reflection of that. Where health care is concerned, most people don't support the idea that ALL our health care should be run by the government and Obama's health proposals reflect that. The great majority of us who already have health insurance through work will keep that insurance. The ones who will benefit from his plan are the ones who currently have no health insurance. That is far from being a socialist system. Frankly, I welcome the idea that a government health plan will be one of many options of insurance. It introduces a new player into the competition. If it turns out that this smaller scale government health plan works, then more people will buy into it and it will win out in competition. If it doesn't work, then it will likely die out.

Because the question will ultimately be \"who's\" sovereignty. The EU didn't help them either, since it's entire premise for existence was to have a platform economically to combat the US dollar to favor imports and exports... we have seen many nations in Europe have some issues here.\n\n What do you mean by their \"porous\" world view, or by your statement \"who's sovereignty\"? Why do you think that the only reason for the EU is to combat the US dollar? No matter where it started, it has evolved into a far greater political / economic union. I guess I am simply asking you to be more clear in your criticism of Europe. I currently simply do not understand your arguement.\n \nWell... we aren't perfect, nor will any solution we come up with, but the one most consistently outperforming the socialized solution is in fact private sector contributions. We cannot legislate motivation... but we can create guidelines for ethics which is a lot less costly than what Obama proposes which is nothing more than Hillary Care with his name on it. \n\n We are not faced with a choice of pure Capitalism vs pure Socialism. Neither the US nor Europe represent these pure extremes. Europe has more socialistic tendencies than the US - in that there is socialized health care, education, and more industries are government owned - but you can't deny that they are mainly a capitalist system - most industries are private. The US is also not a pure Capitalist system since we have many restraints on industry that benefit employees and consumers, and some programs (K-12 education, some college education, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, ...) are socialized. So, the EU vs the USA systems lie on two different levels of the gray scale in between the two extreme pure-Capitalist vs pure-Socialist systems. \n \n What Obama is proposing is far from pure Socialist. Indeed, given that the great majority of us would keep our current work-sponsored health care, it is only a small move left and far from the European system. Why do you think that the Obama health care plan is so socialist? How could you call it socialist if the great majority of us keep our current coverage? Please do not dodge this question.\n \nThe gaping hole you refer to is brought on by the amount of government control over what solutions that can be provided and where the over reach will end of course companies are going to back off of they perceive interventionism from the government. It is cause and effect... it's that simple. Socialized health care forces providers to [against their ability to afford the resources to maintain] provide care regardless of the condition they are in. That is why Tenn-Care failed... they are still bailing the failed system today.

No one can compete with the government with socialized medicine, that is against what we have here.\n\n I am not familiar with Tenn-Care, but I would think that any business that wants to be profitable will find it hard to ensure the poor since they simply cannot afford the health care costs that they, on average, would incur. You still have not presented any ideas on how the private sector could address this. Criticising government solutions is all well and good as long as one proposes alternatives. General vague exclamations of the private sector being an answer to everything is a bogus arguement when actual situations arise where the private sector has not shown a solution - in this case, health car for the poor. So, if you have no alternate private sector idea in how the poor can get health care, then that only leaves government intervention.\n \n Also, you keep coming back to an assumption that Democrats want purely socialized care. Though some might, it is clear that this new administration does not. They are only using it to solve an existing problem of the uninsured. Most of us would keep our current care. Also, I believe there might be some new reforms to force insurance carriers to accept pre-existing conditions.\n \nWell, I hear what you are saying, but as a former stock broker... I'll tell you this. We have three classes of investor in our markets. We'll have the short sell \"bump n run\" investor... the mid-term investor who typically holds a stock 3 months to 3 years and then you have the long haul investor who looks at the big picture. They mirror our individual spending habits, short term impulse fatten-the-calf investing... mid-term meat on the table investing, and long term stability.

Without the short sell guys, we would truly be screwed right now. I wrote an article on fixes for this housing debacle we're in... regulation would have helped only so much, it was the looking the other way that got us in this mess. \n\n \"Looking the other way\" could have been helped with effective regulation. Regulation is useless if it is not practiced and enforced.\n \nThe Christian response is... there has been leadership in that area. History will bear that out, in 325 A.D. we saw the formation of hospitals as a byproduct of th Council of Nycea, as well as civic contributions from organizations such as Salvation Army, and Goodwill which were formed before the great depression that stood in the gap for many of these social issues you feel the government can somehow how perform better than people from the heart.

However, charity has often been a source of absolutely last resort - keeping people from starving, helping give them some roof over their heads with Christian sponsored homeless shelters. Unfortunately, modern health care is far more expensive per person than charities have typically been able to provide. Are you really claiming that charities would be able to pay the health bills of all the poor uninsured? I would be very skeptical that that would happen - on a small scale perhaps, but not nearly enough to fill all the needs. The costs of health care are so large that voluntary charities would have a very hard time keeping up. The costs of the current entitlements of Medicare/Medicaid already form a large part of the US budget - hundreds of billions of dollars. I have heard estimates of tens of billions of dollars for the proposed new entitlement - a hefty bill for charities to take on. Either way, if we already have this social safety net for seniors through Medicare/Medicaid, why not help subsidize the poor for health care as well? Why do we care for one group and not the other?\n \nNo, unfortunately... decisive and emphatic no based on empirical evidence are not dismissed as jumping to conclusions, however... I feel you are trying to rationalize socialism which I do feel is a topic Americans should have up for discussion, between capitalism and charitable benevolence, these have been the bellwethers of American society as a whole, but now it seems these are now under attack.\n\n Again, I do think that Christian charities can be quite beneficial to society but they are not enough. Do you think that, if one took away the social program of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, that charities would be able to make up for that loss? Given the huge costs of these entitlements, I doubt that they would, and I would expect that any reasoning person would agree. Health care subsidies for the poor does add an entitlement, but one that polls show people are willing to pay for through taxes - partly because they themselves know that, if they lost their job, they could also face being without health care. I just find your claims that charity can solve these huge problems completely unrealistic. Right now, the temporary ad-hoc solution is that the consumers unwillingly pay for the health of the poor through higher premiums on their health insurance due to a redistribution of costs at the hospital. You completely underestimate the costs to have this purely rest on the shoulders of givers of charity.\n \n Democrats love employees... but hate employers that is the reality in that statement. But you cannot have the latter prior the latter, American is a very successful meritocracy... and that's all there is to it. we need to intradict the voice of the vicotcrats... those who feel victimized all the time but cannot make a viable contribution elsewhere. We need to make the environment in that such a way as they are robbed of the ability to gripe because there is so much opportunity to make excuses... unfettered capitalism with balanced charity have always worked here and I fail to see how it won't work know.\n\n You seem to assume that all Democrats are far left wing that hate employers. You are wrong. Capitalism at the turn of the 19th-20th centuries was largely unfetered and this lack of government regulation led to very poor working conditions for vast groups of people. That was the only time where large percentages of people seriously considered Socialism. Once Capitalism allowed itself to be fetered by government regulations of working hours, working conditions, minimum wage, employer sponsored benefits, etc., people's views changed so that, nowadays, the great majority of people (including the majority of Democrats) support Capitalism, as long as it continues to be regulated for the sake of employees and consumers. I don't know why you think that Democrats want to all be socialist. You have been listening to too many of the fear mongers that jump to conclusions based on thin or nonexistent evidence.\n \nClinton being president then got the benefit of the achievement from being on a forced diet the conservative majority placed on his table and mandated a reduction... they made Clinton clear the welfare rolls with programs such as Back to Work, and putting serious limits on AFDC as far women having more children just to stay on it.\n\n If Clinton was fully against welfare reform, he would have vetoed all the bills. \n \nLiberals like to pull that \"think of the poor\" heart string, like they even care, when they don't it is just a tool that can help advance the cause of larger government. Robin Hood stories fascinate liberals... sort of like Santa does children, but it flies in the face of invididual responsiblity,practicality and pragmatism, all three things they can't stand. Let the benevolence organizations serve the poor, they have been doing better period - predating all forms of government in moderns society today, so let them do it.

If they are not working, get a job... but if they won't work - why should we have a safety net... government safety nets have always produced a slacker element.\n\n Here you are going into blast-the-liberals, fear mongering mode. First, I am a left-of-center moderate, not a far left wing liberal. I certainly do not advocate Socialism and neither do most Democrats. To think otherwise is simple fear mongering and paranoia based on negligible evidence. Second, I noticed that you avoided the arguement about what one actually DOES about the poor uninsured. So far, the only thing I have heard from you is a suggestion that charities can handle that. If that is your suggestion, then it is absurd. Do you have any idea how much health care costs? I suspect that you don't.",

   "Your opinion confuses me, in the abortion thread you preach pro-life for every situation and yet in this thread you sprout that you should not have to provide any safety net for the people you force into the world.\n\n \n \n The two are perfectly consistent with each other... I provided no opinion, I simply reiterated the core values this country's laws are based on... sorry in your mind that gets whittled down to opinion... but it was what it was and should expect that. Abortion is a safety net in the most horrific way... when the government gets involved with providing reset buttons for human behavior, we will always be encouraging the worse behavior and that is now beyond proven. Feminists packaged the lie of abortion as a so-called \"right\" a woman has over her body, fact is she can't get pregnant by herself - that means a choice clearly to do right or wrong is at play... citizens are supposed to carry themselves in a manner the reflects moral propriety - not abject laciviousness, but that is what we have gotten with this.\n \n It took a behavior instigated by the environment to entertain that situation where a problom could result and if a \"little boo-boo\" ocured, there is a reset button in the name of a state sponsored program which is nothing short [in my opinion] of genocide. People need to have self control, and protect themselves... but when you have abortion - why should they? Our economy has paid the price for this illicit nonsense and it needs to checked. State sponsored health care would be a boon to homosexual activity and th long term costs associated with HIV and AIDS, there will be abuses such a s percieved gender \"issues\" some person is going to make the grand case the state shoul dpay for the sex change operation... and so goes the downward spiral. Drug users too also would benefit from this as well - all these are social problems we do no need to see a spike in.\n \n \n \n \nYou want abortion eradicated and in the same hand you want to deny the proportionate amount of unwanted children, now adults, any kind of safety net for any abusive upbringing they may have faced as a result of your abortion stance.\n\n \n \n Again, you are confusing some things so please revert tho the above response. However... be productive and you won't have time to get into trouble is one perspective. \n \n \n \nPerhaps you should be asking the people who wont work, why that is? I'd wager you would be introduced to my world of childrens services, a division of social/human services.\n\n \n Yes we have spoke several times and frankly am appalled that a mindset like your is on the tax payer dime in that environment, you encourage the options because you're there. Without the option... guess what - people change their habits and lifesyle... lastly, why you;s I support a voice that has had its way int he culture and cannot hide the the worst of social ills come as a byproduct to their policies an ideals, they just don't work.\n \n \n \nIt is naive to assume that for everyone, obtaining and keeping a job is simple. I think if you spent a month in social services you would be singing a very different tune.\n\n \n That is never a problem for people that exercise self control... again something that we don't hear coming from the left because it actually works against their agenda. Well, that is a very presumptuous position to take not knowing me..., I have come along way. from the welfare roll to Vice President of two national sales regions so, I know little bit about what I am saying. There is no substitute for get up and make it happen. The Church was always there for end of rope situations that provided assistance for people in real need of help and to this day ministers to the needs of many despite flagrant unwarranted attacks for social progressives that feel that is the job of the state. I emphatically restate... that is not what our fore father drafted, and laid their lives down for. This is a paltry, pittance of a substitute, I am sorry I could never come to agree with your position having been there myself.\n \n \n \n \nHealthcare should be a right for every human, it should not have any eligibilty conditions. I'm in the middle income bracket and i have no issue contriubuting to the healthcare of people you would be forcing into the world.\n How is that a religous, high income earning, educated former stockbroker cannot?\n\n \n Health care is not a civil right, I understand you come from the over generous ranks of the left, but the notion is purely altruistic, but not at all practical. I have said this many times before... the government didn't' bring you into the world, it does lift the fork that puts the food into your body that is more than likely not good for you... and they don't live your lifestyle for you. Why should they protect your health? The notion is ludicrous... let the private sector solve it, there have been great strides already in affordable. But of course with they don't' want to hear having it tethered to productivity. State sponsored health care will bring America's economic future to a screeching halt, that's why we cannot do it - it simply isn't feasible.\n \n \n \nYou want all pregnancies to continue, but you have conditions on how you will support the spawn once they reach adulthood. Am i wrong?\n\n \n \n I want American youth... and the slightly older \"forever 21\" set to act like they have some sense. Why is it we never hear the left speak on self control, moral propriety and productivity? That is the question I pose to you... and I already know... searching high and low, there won't be even one name period talking on that level... not even your newly crowned messianic good guy...

   "What do you mean by their \"porous\" world view, or by your statement \"who's sovereignty\"? Why do you think that the only reason for the EU is to combat the US dollar? No matter where it started, it has evolved into a far greater political / economic union. I guess I am simply asking you to be more clear in your criticism of Europe. I currently simply do not understand your arguement.\n\n \n \n Well, I respect your opinion but it based on an optimistic appraisal without the benefit of the knowledge why Europe is going through what it is, and what it has.. and why that is effecting us here? The problem is our system has utterly embarrassed the humanist who though they where the end all be all, and unquestioned authority on morality and economics has been uttely shut down. Now they have sent the agent provavcatuers over here to bring us down... all the while, believe it or not, Europe is adaopting a more captilaist approach, but it will not be truly succuessful until peoples rights are not granted from thet state as it deems suitable... but from God. Our system has shown what happens when you don't lean to your own understanding and allow people to freely engage the markets with their own means, their own talents, ideas [note I didnt' say ideals] all in the name of freedom, ther freedom to exprss those ideas in a way that can all that individual to prove the best living for themselves and their family. Freedom from the oppression of a imperialist system that collapsed and with no healthy middle class - there were huge gaps in the classes, which is why Marxism got the legs it did and when it did. Those who had the means... or not, beg, borrow or steal came here. Because their human rights were not dolled out by the state as it is in many European states, but by Almighty God.\n \n \n \n \nWe are not faced with a choice of pure Capitalism vs pure Socialism. Neither the US nor Europe represent these pure extremes. Europe has more socialistic tendencies than the US - in that there is socialized health care, education, and more industries are government owned - but you can't deny that they are mainly a capitalist system - most industries are private. The US is also not a pure Capitalist system since we have many restraints on industry that benefit employees and consumers, and some programs (K-12 education, some college education, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, ...) are socialized. So, the EU vs the USA systems lie on two different levels of the gray scale in between the two extreme pure-Capitalist vs pure-Socialist systems. \n\n \n \n No, I don't agree with thaty. You are a smart guy and I very much in debating with you but I have to say you are speculating in an area that you cannot support with fact. I am fully prepared to debate you on this topic... you happened to pic a forte of mine based on experience. We [for all intensive purposes] invented modern captialism... It has never been utilized on the scale we have here. Which is why the world markets depend on us, first. So we are the \"purest\" model there is, I will agree with you on this... as I have spent time in finance. This could only happen with minimal regulation... a nation governed by the rule of law is the best model for that. The Federalist\n Papers are a great resourse for understandign the moral codec underneath our lending system, the ability to sue over breached contracts etc. All based on a Judeo Christian ether that makes this all possible, the humanist couldn't do this on their own impteous because the nature of relativsm. What is rigth in one man's eyes... is an afront to another, there is no standard. Before humanism... Europe had a more ethical system - Rome enforced most of it by way of its influence, but that is still a far cry from the quandary the humanist model is confronted with, because post modern though followed Christianty.. so it's idea of good still had a faint echo from the Church.\n \n \n \nWhat Obama is proposing is far from pure Socialist. Indeed, given that the great majority of us would keep our current work-sponsored health care, it is only a small move left and far from the European system. Why do you think that the Obama health care plan is so socialist? How could you call it socialist if the great majority of us keep our current coverage? Please do not dodge this question.\n\n \n No, it is not at all... quacks like a duck, walks like a duck, must be chicken? Not so... if the underlying motif is to take something from someone else, mandate participation... an increase taxes for liquidity. Guess what you have buddy? TennCare... It was a disaster, Obama's plan is nothing but Hillary's plan with the Obama name on it - very little differs. Anyway you slice it... it would be a disaster.\n \n Obama Channels Hillary on Health Care - TIME\n \n \nI am not familiar with Tenn-Care, but I would think that any business that wants to be profitable will find it hard to ensure the poor since they simply cannot afford the health care costs that they, on average, would incur. You still have not presented any ideas on how the private sector could address this. Criticising government solutions is all well and good as long as one proposes alternatives. General vague exclamations of the private sector being an answer to everything is a bogus arguement when actual situations arise where the private sector has not shown a solution - in this case, health car for the poor. So, if you have no alternate private sector idea in how the poor can get health care, then that only leaves government intervention.\n\n \n Read up on Tenn Care... lol! I can't even talk to you about it. But there should be no government mandate for employers to provide it... there should be a reasonable tax break if you provide it yourself. If your job provides it.. then they should a part of your deduction for it... that is how I think [in part ] they should address it.\n \n \n \nAlso, you keep coming back to an assumption that Democrats want purely socialized care.\n \n \n They have shown anything to the contrary to refute your claim, not one thing. Remeber, we are not talking about Kennedy Democrats here, these are full fledged Jungian/Marxist nutters on the Hill. They have no intent of having anything less than a Euracracy here.\n \n \n \nThough some might, it is clear that this new administration does not. \n\n \n \"Dooon't Yoooou Believeee it\" -Bugs Bunny\n \n \n \nThey are only using it to solve an existing problem of the uninsured.\n \n \n Best thing they can do is the the conservatives put forth a set of guidelines and leave it up the free market. The rest American is not prepared to pay a price like that. \n \n \n \nMost of us would keep our current care. Also, I believe there might be some new reforms to force insurance carriers to accept pre-existing conditions.\n\n \n Again, the devil is in the details... this is up the the market. I wrote a blog on what I though would be an acceptable plan and acceptable amount of gevernment involvement. I may repost it here...\n \n \n \n\"Looking the other way\" could have been helped with effective regulation. Regulation is useless if it is not practiced and enforced.\n\n \n I agree in part, but with gross violations of ethics with the major players in this like Barney Franks, his live in lover and Fannie Mae executive... Chris Dodd, and Madeline Tallbot [the real criminal in this], and yes... your boy Barack Obama, he is knee deep in it as well. \n \n \n \n \nI do recognize and appreciate the charity work done by churches. However, charity has often been a source of absolutely last resort\n\n \n It is supposed to be a last resort... because you should let yourself get that far. It isn't as draconian and you make it sound there are many faith based organizations that have rental assistance programs, legal aid.. and a host of other counseling and medial services. It is quite a bit more advanced than you think, you'd be suprised buddy!\n \n \n \n \nAre you really claiming that charities would be able to pay the health bills of all the poor uninsured? I would be very skeptical that that would happen - on a small scale perhaps, but not nearly enough to fill all the needs. \n\n \n Do you know how many Christian doctors provide services for free and write it off? or gets a little assistance from faith based organizations. This has been a long tradition since 325 A.D. and the Nycean council... when we got hospitals from. These were not secualat institutions... these were novations of Christian engaging of the culture. \n \n \n \nThe costs of health care are so large that voluntary charities would have a very hard time keeping up. \n\n \n Not if they get tax guided tips from our tax forms from approved charities,, another part of my plan. Preset amounts that could be donated out of your form... $5, $10... that would cover those who don't' pay taxes and are below the poverty level. Which should always be in the extreme minority...\n \n \n \nThe costs of the current entitlements of Medicare/Medicaid already form a large part of the US budget - hundreds of billions of dollars. I have heard estimates of tens of billions of dollars for the proposed new entitlement - a hefty bill for charities to take on. Either way, if we already have this social safety net for seniors through Medicare/Medicaid, why not help subsidize the poor for health care as well? Why do we care for one group and not the other?\n\n \n Those are other issues that can be dealt with by addressing our economic woes first... including stopping abortion. It has almost zeroed out or birth rate, we didn't have the phenomena before Roe v. Wade... this was part of a plan to make so major social changes in the lifetimes of these social engineers who authors this nonsense.. and subsequently is the real reason for abortion, it is nothing more than a population control tactic for insurgent regimes to effect population control in their lifetimes. Stalin used it, Mao used it... we are using it. \n \n \n \nAgain, I do think that Christian charities can be quite beneficial to society but they are not enough. Do you think that, if one took away the social program of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, that charities would be able to make up for that loss? Given the huge costs of these entitlements, I doubt that they would, and I would expect that any reasoning person would agree. Health care subsidies for the poor does add an entitlement, but one that polls show people are willing to pay for through taxes - partly because they themselves know that, if they lost their job, they could also face being without health care. I just find your claims that charity can solve these huge problems completely unrealistic. Right now, the temporary ad-hoc solution is that the consumers unwillingly pay for the health of the poor through higher premiums on their health insurance due to a redistribution of costs at the hospital. You completely underestimate the costs to have this purely rest on the shoulders of givers of charity.\n\n \n \n I understand you point and agree in part, but it is not carried by the shoulders of charity in majority.\n \n \n \n \n \nYou seem to assume that all Democrats are far left wing that hate employers. You are wrong. Capitalism at the turn of the 19th-20th centuries was largely unfetered and this lack of government regulation led to very poor working conditions for vast groups of people. That was the only time where large percentages of people seriously considered Socialism. Once Capitalism allowed itself to be fetered by government regulations of working hours, working conditions, minimum wage, employer sponsored benefits, etc., people's views changed so that, nowadays, the great majority of people (including the majority of Democrats) support Capitalism, as long as it continues to be regulated for the sake of employees and consumers. I don't know why you think that Democrats want to all be socialist. You have been listening to too many of the fear mongers that jump to conclusions based on thin or nonexistent evidence.\n\n \n \n No... I look at the legacy we are paying a price for the unions embedding themselves where they don't need to be, but that is another argument.\n \n \n \nIf Clinton was fully against welfare reform, he would have vetoed all the bills. \n\n \n Ask Ole' Bill... he vetoed nothing. Remeber the contract w. America? that's why.. oh, second term politics.\n \n \n \nHere you are going into blast-the-liberals, fear mongering mode. First, I am a left-of-center moderate, not a far left wing liberal. I certainly do not advocate Socialism and neither do most Democrats. To think otherwise is simple fear mongering and paranoia based on negligible evidence. Second, I noticed that you avoided the arguement about what one actually DOES about the poor uninsured. So far, the only thing I have heard from you is a suggestion that charities can handle that. If that is your suggestion, then it is absurd. Do you have any idea how much health care costs? I suspect that you don't.\n\n \n No my left-of-center friend, they do enough of that on their own for me to ever have to pick the mantle for... I just call it like I see played out, not feel.. but revealed. Also you mistakenly assume I meant all charities assume the entire strata... no, I never said that... just the lower tiers.",

Because their human rights were not dolled out by the state as it is in many European states, but by Almighty God.\n\n I am not really understanding your arguement since it is stated in broad vague terms. To see if I understand you correctly, you seem to be implying the following (and please correct me if I am misunderstanding):\n \n 1) You believe that, in this country, our rights come from God, not from the State. I would disagree. Though the Declaration of Independence had fancy rhethoric about inalienable rights, the actual decisions on rights were made by the political process that put together the Constitution. Even when Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, he originally wrote that these rights came from the \"pulpit\" (i.e. from God) but was corrected by Franklin to be \"self-evident\" since he thought that the religious reference would not pass. Either way, European countries were also influenced by an idea of inalienable rights - think of the slogans of the French revolution \"Liberty, Fraternity, Equality\".\n \n 2) You somehow connect our religion with our economic success. If you are making this connection, please be SPECIFIC in how you think they are connected.\n \n 3) You seem to say that Europe today is still burdened by the collapse of their imperialist regimes and that, even today, there are huge disparaties that you imply are much larger than in the US. This is not proven. Please point to official web sites that show that the financial disparaties in Europe are much larger than in the US - where Europe is usually best defined by its most prominent countries of the UK, Germany and France.\n \n 4) You somehow suggest that the Europeans are not free. Given that they are now all democracies, I do not follow that point.\n \n \n So, please be SPECIFIC about the points you are making. These vague general references are simply very difficult to follow.\n \nNo, I don't agree with thaty. You are a smart guy and I very much in debating with you but I have to say you are speculating in an area that you cannot support with fact. I am fully prepared to debate you on this topic... you happened to pic a forte of mine based on experience. We [for all intensive purposes] invented modern captialism... It has never been utilized on the scale we have here. Which is why the world markets depend on us, first. So we are the \"purest\" model there is, I will agree with you on this... as I have spent time in finance. This could only happen with minimal regulation... a nation governed by the rule of law is the best model for that.

Europe had a more ethical system - Rome enforced most of it by way of its influence, but that is still a far cry from the quandary the humanist model is confronted with, because post modern though followed Christianty.. so it's idea of good still had a faint echo from the Church.\n\n A few points need to be addressed:\n \n First, I think we differ in our definition of what is \"pure\" Capitalism and what is \"pure\" Socialism. In my understandting of pure Capitalism, nearly everything is run by the private sector with negligible or non-existent government intervention and there are no government run social programs. Early on in our country's history, even education and money were run privately. Many of the trends in the 19th century were to make the government run the monetary system, make the government run K-12 education (or an earlier subset of that), government run postal service, etc, and in the 20th century, the introduction of the social programs of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, government run Prescription drug programs, etc - all of which would fall under your presumed definition of socialist programs (or am I mistaken?). In Europe, they have a lot more social programs, but my (and the dictionary's) definition of pure Socialism is that all the \"means of production\" (i.e. industry) is owned by the government. This is simply not true in Europe. Even the countries that are the closest to being socialist - ex. Sweden - still have a lot of private industries. Certainly, France and Germany have a very wide range of private industries. \n \n That is why I don't call us a \"pure\" Capitalist system and I do not call Europe \"pure\" Socialist but put both of our systems on a gray scale between the two. If you disagree, then please SPECIFICALLY define \"pure\" Capitalism and \"pure\" Socialism.\n \n Secondly, you seem to lay all the positive changes in the US to a belief in God. Though I will agree that Christianity helped draw sympathy to the plight of the poor and underpriviledged, it did not prevent governments during Christendom to continue very lopsided power structure of Monarchies, essential slavery of Serfdom, real slavery of Africans, etc. It was not until the enlightment (the first main push toward secular reasoning) that many of the assumptions underlying societies began to be so seriously questioned that they affected governments. The founders of the US were very influenced by Enlightment thinkers, as were the revolutionary French, etc. Before that, leaders manipulated religion for their purposes. Remember the unquestioned \"divine right of kings\"? Secular thinking allowed rationality to creep back into discourse on how countries should be run.\n \n No, it is not at all... quacks like a duck, walks like a duck, must be chicken? Not so... if the underlying motif is to take something from someone else, mandate participation... an increase taxes for liquidity. Guess what you have buddy? TennCare... It was a disaster, Obama's plan is nothing but Hillary's plan with the Obama name on it - very little differs. Anyway you slice it... it would be a disaster.\n \n Obama Channels Hillary on Health Care - TIME\n\n Again, what do you define as Socialist? Most of us keep our current health care under his system. Does that make our current health care socialist? I just don't follow your logic.\n \nRead up on Tenn Care... lol! I can't even talk to you about it. But there should be no government mandate for employers to provide it... there should be a reasonable tax break if you provide it yourself. If your job provides it.. then they should a part of your deduction for it... that is how I think [in part ] they should address it.\n\n Well, you have the right to your opinion. Luckily, in a Democracy, the people indirectly decide and most are quite happy that employers provide health insurance and, so far, it has not been shown to wreck our economy.\n \nThey have shown anything to the contrary to refute your claim, not one thing. Remeber, we are not talking about Kennedy Democrats here, these are full fledged Jungian/Marxist nutters on the Hill. They have no intent of having anything less than a Euracracy here.\n\n Since you are making the acusation that they want Socialism, the burden is on you to prove that. Nevertheless, I suspect that anybody that supports any sort of government social program will automatically be labeled a Socialist by you. It reminds me of a friend I was arguing with who compared the US to the Nazis by its invasion with Iraq. I disagreed with him and I disagree with you now since I find that exagerated language simply has no place in rational discussions - fun as it may be to use.\n \nBest thing they can do is the the conservatives put forth a set of guidelines and leave it up the free market. The rest American is not prepared to pay a price like that. \n\n The hokus pokus of the free market. It is a religion in itself. Answer me this SPECIFICALLY - how can a free market convince industries to lose money by funding low-cost health insurance for the poor without government help? I keep asking you to give a SPECIFIC solution and you keep dodging the question with sweeping vague generalities. I am asking for SPECIFICS. How could any business afford to insure the poor at low cost premiums when doing so would almost guarantee a loss?\n \nI agree in part, but with gross violations of ethics with the major players in this like Barney Franks, his live in lover and Fannie Mae executive... Chris Dodd, and Madeline Tallbot [the real criminal in this], and yes... your boy Barack Obama, he is knee deep in it as well. \n\n Though I disagree with you, going into this subject could be a long and wordy discussion in itself - and not worth vearing too far from the purpose of this thread. I have already discussed this in another thread with other posters and simply don't feel like going through it again.\n \nIt is supposed to be a last resort... because you should let yourself get that far. It isn't as draconian and you make it sound there are many faith based organizations that have rental assistance programs, legal aid.. and a host of other counseling and medial services. It is quite a bit more advanced than you think, you'd be suprised buddy!\n\n The total amount of US charitable giving is impressively high - just over $300 billion - but that only goes so far. Just over $100 billion of that goes to churches (where some is used for church administration, some is sent overseas and some is used for church charities), some of that goes to the education, some goes to the arts, some goes to foreign aid, some to environmental issues, etc. - and over $20 billion goes to health issues. From U.S. Charitable Giving Estimated to be $306.39 Billion in 2007 | Planned Giving Design Center . The Obama health plan is estimated by factcheck.org to cost between around $50 to $100 billion. Theoretically, it is possible that people could start giving 30% more charity to cover these costs. I simply find that highly unlikely since the uninsured have been with us for quite some time yet the amount of charity that is given for health issues of all sorts is ~$23 billion . That's a huge jump in charitable giving that people show no signs of wanting to make.\n \nDo you know how many Christian doctors provide services for free and write it off? or gets a little assistance from faith based organizations. This has been a long tradition since 325 A.D. and the Nycean council... when we got hospitals from. These were not secualat institutions... these were novations of Christian engaging of the culture. \n\n Impressive and useful as those free services are, they are just a drop in the bucket compared to what is needed. Free clinics typically cannot cover the most urgent care - heart surgeries, the costs of treating cancer, the costs of recovering from violent crime, etc. \n \nNot if they get tax guided tips from our tax forms from approved charities,, another part of my plan. Preset amounts that could be donated out of your form... $5, $10... that would cover those who don't' pay taxes and are below the poverty level. Which should always be in the extreme minority...\n\n Again, the estimates of what it would costs to properly subsidize the poor in health care is ~$50 to $100 billion. That would come out at $500 to $1000 per family (assuming 100 million donors or 1 in 3 Americans) - so $5, $10 would be a drop in the bucket compared to what is needed.\n \nThose are other issues that can be dealt with by addressing our economic woes first... including stopping abortion. It has almost zeroed out or birth rate, we didn't have the phenomena before Roe v. Wade... this was part of a plan to make so major social changes in the lifetimes of these social engineers who authors this nonsense.. and subsequently is the real reason for abortion, it is nothing more than a population control tactic for insurgent regimes to effect population control in their lifetimes. Stalin used it, Mao used it... we are using it. \n\n Do I hear the words \"conspiracy theory\"? Sorry buddy, but you are going off the deep end with this one.\n \nI understand you point and agree in part, but it is not carried by the shoulders of charity in majority.\n\n Not currently. It is mostly policy holders (both individuals and the businesses that pay most of their employees health premium costs) that pay the bills for the urgent care of the uninsured since hospitals who take them on have to recoop their losses somehow. Charities do set up free clinics, but those typically do not cover the most urgent (and most costly) care.\n \nNo my left-of-center friend, they do enough of that on their own for me to ever have to pick the mantle for... I just call it like I see played out, not feel.. but revealed. Also you mistakenly assume I meant all charities assume the entire strata... no, I never said that... just the lower tiers.\n\n How low a teer are you suggesting that charities limit themselves to? There are many working poor families that do not fall into the lowest teer (they still have houses, can afford limited clothes, enough food) but can't afford the high premiums (many thousands of dollars) for health insurance. What would happen to them under your system? How would you suggest that they cope?",

   "I haven't expressed anything in \"broad, vauge\" term... what are you speaking? What wasn't clear...to you?\n\n For example, you first paragraph was unclear. I really had to read into it to try to decifer some points and, even then, I was largely guessing. That is why I asked those questions. \n \n Since you ask \"What wasn't clear .. to you?\", I will ask the questions again which I presented in my last post. Perhaps you will be willing to answer them both directly (answer point by point) and specifically (not general answers but specific answers - ex. in definitions, or specifically stating the details of what you find wrong in Europe, etc.). So, here is my list of questions. Please answer them. I will then, in turn, try to address your points:\n \n In the first paragraph of your previous post, you seem to be implying the following. Please confirm if I understood you correctly and then address my counter-points:\n \n 1) You believe that, in this country, our rights come from God, not from the State. I would disagree. Though the Declaration of Independence had fancy rhethoric about inalienable rights, the actual decisions on rights were made by the political process that put together the Constitution. Even when Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, he originally wrote that these rights came from the \"pulpit\" (i.e. from God) but was corrected by Franklin to be \"self-evident\" since he thought that the religious reference would not pass. Either way, European countries were also influenced by an idea of inalienable rights - think of the slogans of the French revolution \"Liberty, Fraternity, Equality\".\n \n 2) You somehow connect our religion with our economic success. If you are making this connection, please be SPECIFIC in how you think they are connected.\n \n 3) You seem to say that Europe today is still burdened by the collapse of their imperialist regimes and that, even today, there are huge disparaties that you imply are much larger than in the US. This is not proven. Please point to official web sites that show that the financial disparaties in Europe are much larger than in the US - where Europe is usually best defined by its most prominent countries of the UK, Germany and France.\n \n 4) You somehow suggest that the Europeans are not free. Given that they are now all democracies, I do not follow that point.\n \n ---\n Other questions include:\n 5) Please SPECIFICALLY and directly define what you think of as \"pure\" Capitalism and \"pure\" Socialism.\n \n 6) Since Obama's health care plan allows most of us to keep our current private sector coverage, how is that Socialist? Does that mean that our current private plans are socialist since they fall under Obama's general plan which you call socialist?\n \n 7) Please answer SPECIFICALLY - how can a free market convince industries to lose money by funding low-cost health insurance for the poor without government help? How could any business afford to insure the poor at low cost premiums when doing so would almost guarantee a loss?\n \n 8) If you think that charities could cover the health care of the poorest of the poor then, first, how would charities cover the high costs of urgent care that is currently handled by hospitals? If you are suggesting the $5, $10 of your previous post, then this would only handle the very lowest teer. The second question, then, is what would you recomend to poor working families that are above the very lowest teer (they have homes, can afford food and some clothes but cannot aford thousands of dollars a year in health insurance)? What private sector solution do you have for them?\n \n Please answer these questions directly - point by point. I will be happy to do the same to any points you have made.",

However, since people disagreed on these rights, there really wasn't much choice but to define them politically - adding the amendments in the Constitution, a document of the State. Even those ten rights are contested daily. Just look at the limitations different groups would place on the freedom of speech, or the different interpretations various groups have on the second ammendment regarding gun ownership and gun control, there is also contraversy whether or not a right to privacy should be interpreted from various ammendments. All of this shows that we do NOT agree on which rights are inherent to humanity. When people don't agree, you try to resolve those disagreements through the political process. \n \n Note: I am not saying the people don't have a say in the rights they are granted. They do, but not in particular claims of inalienable rights (since different groups come up with different claims) but in their vote for politicians that will support their view of their rights.",

Though I would agree that the government has manipulated rights at various points in our history, such manipulations of rights are not absolute. We still are and have been a Democracy, after all, and can vote in or out candidates that support our position or who overstep their boundaries. The withdrawal of certain rights during wartime seems to be accepted by most people as a necessary sacrifice for the sake of security in such a dire situation. \n \n However, it is another thing entirely when such rights are trod upon when not necessary. That is one of the risks of our current \"war on terrorism\". It puts us in a permanent state of insecurity that lets the government get away with more intrusions on rights than it would in a purely peaceful situation. Fortunately, the initial fear introduced by the 9/11 attacks seems to have largely died down so it seems that people will not be as willing to sacrifice rights for security. Also, unrealistic fearmongering propaganda is not working nearly as well as it used to. The results of this election have partially demonstrated that.\n \n Also, as noted by the statement I bolded in your paragraph, it seems that you think that there are unalienable rights that the government does tread upon. If you believe in inalienable rights, do you then believe that all people agree on these rights or that there is an absolute standard of inalienable rights that can be demonstrated or proven? If not, then how else other than through the political process can people come to an agreement on rights?",

For example, what constitutes \"undue obstacles\"? Something that is \"undue\" for one is perfectly acceptable for another. How about the opportunity to use what one produces. Does that mean that factory workers should get a much larger share of what they produce and that CEOs currently get far too much? How about the poor. For them to even have opportunities (at education, for example) then others (taxpayers) have to sacrifice some money to help fund those opportunities. How does that balance play out in an absolute sense? My view is that it doesn't. I see no other choice but that the details HAD TO be worked out in the political process. If you (or Joel_Henderson) claim that the founders had some structure outside politics that clearly defined these inalienable rights then please state them - I would be very curious, as well as surprised.\n \n Note: I am not claiming that the idea of natural rights is not a useful philosophy. It certainly was useful in opposing the power of the \"divine right of kings\" that the founders argued against - where kings could impose a law or take away rights largely at their whim. What I am saying is that, when grand philosophies meet reality, things don't go smoothly unless everyone agrees - which they don't. The idea of natural / inalienable rights is useful to denote trends in how people view rights but, as I said before, the devil is in the details. After all, a pro-choice advocate might strongly claim that a right to one's own body is a natural right (as part of liberty) but those on the pro-life side obviously disagree.",

   "This is my opinion but it is based on the fact that, outside of the Constitution, there were no innumerated \"inalienable\" rights that all founders agreed to - at least none that I know of.\n \n\n That's why they had 13 states; and there are no rights stated to be \"inalienable\" in the Constitution; are you talking about the Declaration? If so, that's an in excusable error for any hope of informed discussion.\n \n \n If you know of a list of such inalienable rights that were undisputed among founders then please (1) inumerate them and (2) show that they were mutually agreed upon.\n\n No state was bound by the terms of the Declaration.\n \n \nCUNxTime innumerated the \"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\" but these are fairly vague terms and can be interpreted in numerous ways - for ex. what represents \"undue obstacles\", how much should one group sacrifice to give oportunities for an underpriviledged group, etc.\n\n \n Actually that's your entitlement-mentality talking; these terms of the era were ensconced in the theory of NEGATIVE \"rights,\" i.e. no one has the right to affirmatively STOP you from living , being free, or pursuing happiness.\n So the answer is: ZERO!\n \n And the rest is simply HOW these rights are to be enforced-- i.e. how people are to be STOPPED from violating the inalienable rights of others.\n And the answer is always the same: BY CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED.\n \n \n \nAfter all, a pro-choice advocate might strongly claim that a right to one's own body is a natural right (as part of liberty) but those on the pro-life side obviously disagree.\n\n On the basis that one's body ends, where another's begins, and the obvious fact that the freely-chosen act to risk such a relationship, implies a social contract with related obligations.

   "That's why they had 13 states;\n\n Are you claiming that each of the 13 states had their own version of \"inalienable rights\" where people within each of those states agreed on those rights? I would find that highly implausable. Otherwise, I don't see the connection of this statement to the paragraph that it referenced. Perhaps you could eloborate.\n \n and there are no rights stated to be \"inalienable\" in the Constitution; are you talking about the Declaration? If so, that's an in excusable error for any hope of informed discussion.\n\n Yes, the rights stated in the Constitution are not inalienable but they are the only detailed rights that are inumerated by the founders. You have still not referenced any other that could be interpreted as universally accepted inalienable rights. Remember, the topic of this discussion is that you believe that rights are defined by the natural / inalienable rights concept whereas I think that they are really defined politically. You still need to support your contention of how that philosophical concept of inalienable rights translates to reality in any process other than politics.\n \nNo state was bound by the terms of the Declaration.\n\n This is a non-sequitor - i.e. I don't see the logic of how you got from my request for you to inumerate the inalienable rights to this statement. Perhaps, once again, you are saying that there were subsets of inalienable rights that were universally agreed upon within each state - where I would once again disagree. I suspect that you are simply mixing up the concept of state's rights with the unrelated concept of inalienable rights.\n \nActually that's your entitlement-mentality talking; these terms of the era were ensconced in the theory of NEGATIVE \"rights,\" i.e. no one has the right to affirmatively STOP you from living , being free, or pursuing happiness.\n So the answer is: ZERO!\n\n Ok, that is your libertarian-conservative (not feel responsible for your fellow man) answer to the one question about taxpayers paying for opportunities for the poor. How about the other variation I mentioned - i.e. CUNxTime stated an inalienable right of \"the ability to move, speak, work, etc. without the govt. erecting undue obstacles\" where I mentioned to you that what constituted \"undue obstacles\" would be relative to individual opinion. How can that be an inalienable right if people would be undecided about its specifics. Another example is Freedom of Speech. If it were absolute, then one could have Neo-Nazis giving rallies in Jewish neighborhoods, people openly espousing assasinations on the internet, and people telling X-rated stories in public in front of grammar schools. It is obviously not considered an absolute right by nearly anyone - the restrictions are dependent on where individuals would place the limit. The agregate of individual opinion is then reconciled through the political process. My bottom line is that there are no inalienable rights that are both described in detail and universally agreed to - they are all agreed to by compromise of conflicting opinions within a political process. Otherwise, there is just the grand philosophy of natural rights floating above reality but never applied to it. Ugly compromise-seeking politics was the only way to apply natural rights philosophy to reality.\n \nAnd the rest is simply HOW these rights are to be enforced-- i.e. how people are to be STOPPED from violating the inalienable rights of others.\n And the answer is always the same: BY CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED.\n\n But you have to have an agreement on which rights are to be protected before you even set up a system of protecting them. You keep avoiding the point that people did NOT agree on the specifics of natural rights. Why do you keep avoiding this point if not because you realize that it represents a hole in your logic?\n \nOn the basis that one's body ends, where another's begins, and the obvious fact that the freely-chosen act to risk such a relationship, implies a social contract with related obligations. Men face this all the time-- it's called \"paternity law,\" but women want abortion to make them \"equal\" despite giving men no similar \"choice\" to opt out of such a contract-- despite that their interest involves the right to LIFE of the unborn, not simply property.\n\n This could start a long unrelated tangent, best left to the abortion forum. \n \nThus it's here we see, that the issue is not a matter of \"details,\" but of FUNDAMENTALS-- specifically, that the people of every state retained their respective national soveregnty for this very REASON, i.e. to avoid any elite arbiter who could construe the law against all reason (morality) and consistency (ethics)-- quite away from the consenting governed.\n Rather, pompous asses like Lincoln destroyed this bastion of enforcement, and now we live under a masked empire.\n\n You seem to be under the erroneous assumption that if you move the question of inalienable rights from federal level to state level, you solve the problem. That is wrong. Just as at the federal level, people at the state level also disagree about what constitutes inalienable rights so one would still have to solve the disagreements by a political process of compromise. I simply see no way of getting around it. No matter where it is practiced, the bottom line is that rights are not defined ultimately by a detailed concept of inalienable rights but by the agreement, through compromise of conflicting views about rights, by the political process. That is and continues to be my point. If you want to maintain the idea of inalienable rights, you really need to address the issue of what happens when people disagree on them - as they do. Unless you stop avoiding that glaring problem and continue to dance around it, your arguements will have a huge logical hole in them.",

Since you seem to be avoiding this point, it is important for you and Joel_Henderson, in this debate, to state whether or not you think that people agree on what constitutes natural rights and, if so, what are they and, if not, how does one resolve the differences in opinion? I simply see no way of getting around the problem of differences in views about natural rights other than by political process. You and Joel_Henderson, instead, seem to simply ignore the problem and pretend that it doesn't exist.\n \n Nevertheless, I do see where you are coming from in the gut feeling that there are rights the we feel we deserve, independent of government. However, once again, the gut feelings about rights from one person often differ from that of another so the devil is once again in the details. The idea of natural rights didn't arise in a vacuum. It arose during a time when there were absolute authorities of the state that could pass down laws or take away freedoms without consulting the people - largely dependent upon the will of the sovereign. Natural rights seemed to argue that we deserve rights not as a gift of the sovereign but for our own sake as people - a natural part of the human condition not granted by an authority. As a philosophy, it was therefore useful to counter such royal authority. However, there is a difference between the opposing philosophy faced by natural rights in its early days and the opposing philosophy now. In its early days, natural philosophy mainly argued against kings imposing arbitrary justice and rights being only given by such powerful manarchs, not deserved. Nowadays, in Democracies, we theoretically control our own government and determine our own rights as a people - not some authority that is imposed on us. So a political determination of rights nowadays means that we, the people, choose our rights through our Democratic government. That is a far cry from a politically determined right where sovereigns arbitrarily choose which rights to give and which to take away. In a democracy, if we let rights be taken away against our will by a president / congress and then don't \"vote the bastards out\" in our next election, it would only be our own fault.",

Every government is composed of individuals with their own egos, quests for power, and limitations in judgement. So, that is why it was so important to include the balance of powers, free elections, and other measures of accountability that were built into our system of government. On the other hand, as you say, there can be a \"tyranny of the majority\" so the safeguards of defining rights in the Constitution which would take a very high majority to overturn is also very useful. Either way, I think we both agree that this country was founded on the idea that the government is supposed to work for the people - adapt itself toward what is best for the people and not exploit them with corruption of overstepping the bounds of power. The Constitution and our general government organization which it presents has been fairly good up to now in protecting our rights (minus a few unfortunate examples in history). I think that the concept of inalienable rights was tied in with the concept of people ultimately having the power and this later point is what endures most. The concept of natural rights themselves was left mainly on the wayside once the core set of rights written out in the Bill of Rights was introduced. In some ways, it would have been so much easier if they had made more of an effort to agree on and spell out a more comprehensive detailed list of rights. It would spare us contraversies such as we face today - for example, whether there is an inherent right to privacy in the Constitution.",
