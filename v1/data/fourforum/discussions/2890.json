He was born and grew up in Flint Michigan (he claims he did, but it was actually Davison, Michigan) and worked on the assembly line for GM. Then he was fired for being lazy and not showing up to work. So what does he do, make a film (Roger & Me) that contains misstatements, lies, and distortions to try and bring GM down. And from then on he claims he is fighting for the working-class man. But when asked about small businesses he says they all support right-wing groups and says, \"F*ck all these small businesses-f*ck 'em all! Bring in the chains. F*ck 'em all!\" Wow.

And once again when asked what he thought about grossing $55 million for his movie Bowling for Columbine, he says \"Average working stiffs were willing to pay 7 bucks to see my movie.\" Once again he turns on those he was supporting, calling them \"stiffs\".

But he lashes out at anyone who tries to critique his work. That's how it works in the movies. Siskel and Ebert criticized every movie that came out, so artists have to know that they are going to be scrutinized. But Moore just can't handle it.

You know why the Senators rebuffed him? Because they know how he works. He interviews people and then switches the sequence of events up, and then portrays the interview as if it actually went that way. So if they agreed, they would have answered a simple question with \"Yes, I think we need to get rid of Osama Bin Laden\" and in Moore's movie, it comes out and says \"I don't think Bin Laden is a bad guy\". That's what Moore does. Thus, they had a pretty damn good reason to refuse his interview. And they also didn't accuse him of slander and make a scence about it like Moore did with Wilson. No, Moore won't make them look bad. His editing crew will do that. \n \n \n \n \nHates America?

He is a narcissist. He likes nothing but himself. Nearly everyone who works for him attests to that. He cares for nobody but himself. He offered a private screening of Bowling for Columbine for the victims' families, and he had the nerve to charge them. What a piece of trash! And then some students decided to make a monument at their school in memory of the shootings, however they needed some money to do it. He refused to donate any money. He basically just exploited the whole school shooting to make money. That is pretty sick if you ask me.

And they wouldn't be true, becaue Bush isn't a traitor and Charlton Heston isn't a racist nor does he hate the US. But Moore does hate the US. I mean he thinks everyone here is stupid, he sayd we're the most uneducated people (we're not, by the way) and even tries to back it up with some BS geography and murder \"trivia\". And you said you only saw his latest movie, so why are you talking about Bowling for Columbine if you haven't even seen it? Actually, he did ask for interviews from Heston and Bush. He interviewed Charlton Heston in the movie. He also sent a letter, which I have a copy of, to George Bush asking him some questions, which is basically an interview. And the questions are:\n \n 1) Is it true that the Bin Laden's have had business with you and your family off and on for the past 25 years?\n 2) What is the \"special relationship\" between the Bushes and the Saudi royal family?\n 3) Who attacked the United States on September 11-a guy on dialysis from a cave in Afghanistan, or your friends, Saudi Arabai?\n 4) Why did you allow a private Saudi jet to fly around the US in the days after September 11 and pick up members of the Bin Laden family and then fly them out of the country without a proper investigation by the FBI?\n 5) Why are you protecting the \"second amendment rights\" of potential terrorists?\n 6) Were you aware that while you were governor of Texas, the Taliban traveled to Texas to meet with your oil and gas company friends?\n 7) What exactly was that look on your face in the Florida classroom on the morning of September 11 when your chief of staff told you, \"America is under attack?\"\n \n \n Do you actually think Bush is going to take the time to respond to these questions (does he even think Bush is going to take a look at them...he wasted 37 cents and an envelope), only to have them then turned around to make him look bad? I highly doubt it. ONCE AGAIN, I didn't say Moore was obligated to be interviewed. He doesn't have to blow up on the kid either when he asks for an interview. But I am sure if there is 1 little thing wrong with \"Michael Moore Hates America\", he will probably try to sue. However, when people question him about his movie, it's all facts and it's right.

Moore should realize that he is going to be scrutinized if he becomes such a public figure. Can't stand the heat stay out of the kitchen so to speak. I love how some right-wing people insist that it's not a documentary... it's comical how it bunches you up so much :P \n \n No, I do not believe things happen exactly as Moore portrays. However, nor do I believe you or others of your ilk when you scream \"lies lies all lies\". Enough of the facts are true, even taking out his speculation which may or may not be true, to condemn Bush in my eyes. Nothing I've read or seen has convinced me that these are not true. The Right and the Left slants things the way they want to, and I have seen more straight talking in that movie than I have in all of Bush's speeches. \n \n \n\n I didn't say he had to agree to the interview.

No, Moore won't make them look bad. His editing crew will do that.\n\n \n You're right, he has no call to blow up at the kid. However, I understand perfectly how a movie title \"Micheal Moore hates America\" would **** him off so much.\n \n From what I've seen, his portrayals were not taken out of context (remember I've only seen the one movie). Even in context they are very damning.\n \n \n\n Yes, he does hate America. He is a narcissist. He likes nothing but himself. Nearly everyone who works for him attests to that. He cares for nobody but himself. He offered a private screening of Bowling for Columbine for the victims' families, and he had the nerve to charge them. What a piece of trash!

I consider it an insult, especially when he could have said \"Because a lot of people liked my movie.\" But instead, \"a lot of working stiffs wanted to pay 7 bucks to see it.\"\n\n \n Being a narcissist does not mean you hate America. I agree he is getting pretty full of himself :P As for offering private screenings and charging for it, well, that's capitalism for ya. I agree that he should have offered it for free, but I'm not him. If he wants to charge, that's his right as an American. As for being insulted, I also feel sorta insulted when I'm lumped in with \"Average Joe\". My name's not Joe, dammit. But I know it's just an expression.\n \n I'm not really trying to defend Moore, I just think you and the entire Republican party is going overboard. I know it's to preserve the lies and half-truths and distortions of the President, but I still think it's overboard.\n \n \n\n No they weren't, but that might as well have been the title. And they wouldn't be true, becaue Bush isn't a traitor and Charlton Heston isn't a racist nor does he hate the US. But Moore does hate the US.

He interviewed Charlton Heston in the movie. He also sent a letter, which I have a copy of, to George Bush asking him some questions, which is basically an interview. And the questions are:\n\n \n Nor do I believe that Moore hates America. I think the majority of Americans are arrogant fools who don't think beyond the next Big Mac. Am I right? Am I wrong? It's an opinion based on the facts, though a gross exaggeration. I think people who blindly follow any President and don't attempt to find out what is really going on in the world are not the smartest. I believe this is the majority of America. We don't vote, we aren't informed, we believe we can continue to bully the world, we don't care what's happening in other countries... I'm sorry to say that I'm not really impressed with the \"average joe\". Obviously this does not apply to all Americans (the people who frequent these forums have at least the desire to know), but how many people form their opinions based soley on sound bytes provided by the media, be they right- or left-leaning? \n \n Sorry, I read the economic news and it sorta leaves me cynical :P\n \n \n\n Do you actually think Bush is going to take the time to respond to these questions (does he even think Bush is going to take a look at them...he wasted 37 cents and an envelope), only to have them then turned around to make him look bad?

I think Moore did it as a matter of principle then expecting a response. Of course he's going to defend his movie and attack those who say he's wrong. That's human nature",

Here's a picture.\n \n 2) The Saudis, with a $860 billion investment in American firms, own 7% of America.\n Not surprisingly, AMERICANS own the vast majority of America. The total value of all domestic assets held by American households and non-profit organizations in Q1 2004 is $55 trillion. \n \n The Saudis would be a drop in the bucket even if they DID have $860 billion here, but they don't. The total value of foreign investments in the US in 2002, the latest year statistics are available, was $8.58 trillion. \n \n Here's the breakdown of that money, by percentage of the $8.58 trillion -- NOT by percentage of all of America.\n UK - 21.0%\n France - 12.7%\n The Netherlands - 11.5%\n Japan - 11.3%\n Germany - 10.2%\n Switzerland - 8.4%\n Canada - 6.8%\n Luxembourg - 2.5%\n Everyone else with less than 2.5% each- 15.6%\n \n That means Saudi Arabia has less than $215 billion here, if you do the math, which makes sense since the entire GDP of Saudi Arabia is only $286 billion. Seven percent is total ********. \n \n 3) The US gave Bin Laden a 2-month head start before sending special forces after him.\n Yeah, right, like Moore knows exactly where our special forces troops are all the time. Besides, if we really wanted to make sure we didn't let any Al Qaeda troops escape, we'd have to send huge numbers of troops to Afghanistan immediately after Sept. 11 along with invading Pakistan in the process, which I'm sure Moore wouldn't be too happy about either. And where would those huge numbers of troops come from? Probably from places like Moore's hometown of Flint, Michigan, where Moore is so distraught about the military being the most attractive occupation. More on this later. \n \n 4) Bush cut soldiers' pay by 33%.\n Bush may be dopey, but he's not stupid enough to slash the pay of the people he counts on most. Soldiers not only get their regular salaries, but also get added bonuses for things like housing, combat duty, deployment, etc. The Bush administration looked at trimming these bonuses back to their pre-war levels in an effort to save money. Soldiers protested, so the raised bonuses were extended until the end of FY2004 with the approval of both Bush and Congress.\n \n 5) Iraq under Saddam never threatened or harmed any Americans.\n Consider the following:\n -Fugitive terrorist Abdul Rahman Yasin, who mixed the explosives for the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, fled to Iraq shortly after his indictment and stayed there for several years.\n -Fugitive terrorist Abu Nidal was funded by Saddam and sheltered in Baghdad for years before Saddam changed his mind and expelled him in 1983 in an effort to please us. Abu Nidal was responsible for a wide variety of international terrorist attacks. \n -Fugitive terrorist Abu Abbas, responsible for the 1985 hijacking of the Achilles Lauro cruise liner in which a disabled American Jew was shot dead and thrown overboard, was sheltered in Baghdad until 2003 when invading American troops captured him. \n -Fugitive terrorist (notice a pattern here?) Abu Musab al-Zarqawi fled to Iraq from Afghanistan with two dozen Al-Qaeda terrorists in May 2002 and stayed to organize terror plots. He is now directing insurgent operations against American troops.\n -Iraqis held American (and non-American) hostages for months following its invasion of Kuwait in 1990, threatening to use them as human shields. \n -Iraqi intelligence agents were caught trying to kill former President Bush during a visit to Kuwait in 1993. In response, Bill Clinton ordered a cruise missile strike on Iraqi intelligence headquarters, killing nine civilians in the process. Where was Michael Moore then?\n -The Iraqi military for years shot at US and British aircraft enforcing no-fly zones.\n No, really. Saddam loved us. \n \n Half-Truths\n \n 1) Bush spent the summer of 2001 fishing and golfing.\n He fished and golfed, but read here for the non-play stuff he did too.\n \n 2) The war in Afghanistan was meant to complete a natural gas pipeline project, led by Unocal and Bush's family, connecting the Caspian Sea with Pakistan. They even went so far as to invite the Taliban to Texas.\n The pipeline project mentioned in the film did exist, and chauvinist Taliban representatives did meet with Unocal at their headquarters in Texas. However, Unocal was merely one competitor in this project. The Argentinian energy firm Bridas was also in the running. Moreover, when the deal was finally signed in May 2002, neither company would be involved. \n \n 3) Only one of Congress' 535 members has a child serving in Iraq. \n This is technically correct -- Senator Tim Johnson's son serves with the 101st Airborne. However, Senator Joseph Biden's son is in the Delaware National Guard, and -- ironically enough -- Attorney General John Ashcroft's son Andy is deployed in the Persian Gulf with the Navy. \n \n 4) Afghanistan's army is the US Army.\n There are mostly US troops in Afghanistan, but there is a NATO force there comprised primarily of German and Canadian troops, as well as many other NATO countries. Moreover, the US Army is training the Afghan army, which already has over 7,000 troops. The Afghan army is helping to enforce security for the elections coming up there this fall, which never would've happened if Moore were in charge.\n \n Oh, the Irony!\n \n 1) In late 2002, Michael Moore stated at a debate that he thought Bin Laden should be considered innocent until proven guilty -- therefore our invasion of Afghanistan was totally unjustified. Judging from his criticism that we sent too few troops into Afghanistan too late, he's apparently changed his mind about this.\n \n 2) Moore criticizes Bush for finishing his reading of a children's book once he heard the World Trade Center was under attack. What was he supposed to do? Cancel the event in the middle and storm out of the room ready to invade Afghanistan? Wouldn't that be spreading the \"aura of fear\" that Moore criticized Bush for creating? Wouldn't that have made Moore even more suspicious about Bush supposedly knowing the attack was coming? Wouldn't it have been better for Bush to just finish the stupid little book about the goat, politely say goodbye to the kids, and then get to work on the crisis (which is what he did)? \n \n 3) Richard Clarke, Bush's former chief of counterterrorism, is one of Moore's heroes in the movie, talking about various intelligence failures and such. For example, Moore dwells on the fact that about two dozen members of Bin Laden's family were allowed to leave America shortly after 9/11. However, what Moore leaves out is that Richard Clarke himself claims he approved those flights, with the approval of the FBI, who had actually been spying on all of them for several years anyway and apparently decided they were not of any interest. \n \n 4) Why doesn't Michael Moore donate all his profits from his films and speeches to charities that help wounded soldiers, if he's so concerned about them?\n \n 5) Moore's pretty leftist -- but the long-suppressed leftists in Iraq and Afghanistan are quite in favor of our interventions there.\n \n 6) James Bath was investigated for fraud committed when he was a director of the Bank of Credit and Commerce (BCCI). This investigation was conducted by a Senate team led by John Kerry.\n \n 7) Moore portrays American soldiers as bloodthirsty killers who like to napalm baby girls and then \"watch the mother****ers burn.\" Unless, of course, they're from Moore's hometown of Flint, Michigan, in which case they're simply innocent victims of poverty. \n \n What Moore Didn't Tell You\n \n 1) Donald Rumsfeld met with Saddam Hussein.\n This happened in late 1983, when Rumsfeld was chosen by the Reagan administration as an envoy to the Middle East. Rumsfeld had previously served in the Nixon and Ford administrations, and at the time was CEO of multinational pharmaceutical company GD Searle (now part of Pfizer), so he would not be an unusual choice as an envoy. \n \n Showing this clip in the film gives the viewer the impression that Rumsfeld was a member of some secret cabal of Americans who built up Saddam into a war machine. Rumsfeld was sent for a number of reasons. At the time, Iran and Iraq were in a serious war, and America feared Iran much more than it feared Iraq. Iran had kidnapped American hostages, and Iranian-backed militiamen had blown up the US Embassy and Marine barracks in Beirut, so Saddam was simply the least evil person to talk to. This is why we decided to look the other way when Saddam gassed Iran. Moreover, while the US did provide intelligence to Iraq, most of Iraq's actual military equipment came from France and Russia, so it is unfair to blame exclusively the US for militarizing Saddam. Those aren't American-made AK-47s they're shooting at us.\n \n 2) Bin Laden family ties with the Bush family, James Bath, and the Carlyle Group\n Moore shows how one of Osama Bin Laden's brothers was involved in investments with a guy named James Bath, and then goes on to explain that, because everyone in the Bin Laden family is related, they must know where Bin Laden is and might be harboring him. \n You have to remember that Osama Bin Laden has 53 siblings, born to 20 different mothers. Just because you're Osama Bin Laden's brother doesn't mean you know where he is, or even that you like him or have ever spent much time with him. In fact, in their family, each wife had a different house, and since Osama doesn't have any siblings by his own mother, he didn't get to know many of his siblings. \n \n Moreover, the Bin Ladens are a wealthy and powerful family in Saudi Arabia, having made its fortune in the construction industry. The Bushes are a wealthy and powerful family in America, having made its fortune in oil. Osama aside, it's not unexpected that these families might have some business contacts. \n \n If Bush really lives in the pockets of the Bin Ladens, and if the Bin Ladens love their brother so much, why have they allowed the US to pursue this \"War on Terror?\" Consider the following:\n -The Saudis were against the destruction of the Taliban. \n -The Saudis forced the US military to move its Mideast military headquarters to Qatar.\n -The Saudis have a Shiite minority, unlike Iraq, whose Shiite majority was oppressed by Saddams Sunni minority. Now that Iraq's Shiites have been emboldened, Saudi Arabia has a new threat to its stability.\n -Iraq's oil industry has been jumpstarted, creating a potential competitor for the Saudi oil companies. \n -Violence in Saudi Arabia is reaching new highs, with foreign workers being kidnapped and whole neighborhoods being stormed and assaulted. \n -The Saudi government's image worldwide has been tarnished -- even in the Middle East itself -- as both Americans and Al Qaeda call for its destruction.\n \n Most telling of all, Saudi Arabia is NOT a member of the \"Coalition of the Willing.\" Why would this be if the Bush and Saud families were really so incestuous?\n \n 3) The Saudis gave Bush $1.4 billion. \n Listen carefully and you'll hear Moore say \"$1.4 billion to BUSH.... and his friends and associates and their companies.\" Since Bush has a bunch of rich friends working for a lot of different companies, investing $1.4 billion in all of their employers combined probably isn't as scary as it sounds. \n \n 4) New Afghan President Hamid Karzai was an advisor to Unocal.\n This is true; Karzai spent 1996-97 advising Unocal on the pipeline mentioned in the movie. However, Moore's portrayal of Karzai as an oilman and a puppet isn't entirely true -- Karzai did have a life outside of Unocal. He spent the 1980s fighting against the Soviets. He is the chief of a Pashtun tribe in Afghanistan, and is a relative of the deposed king. Former Taliban leader Mullah Omar once asked him to represent Afghanistan at the UN, but relations between Karzai and the Taliban soured as Karzai almost died in a mission with US Special Forces to infiltrate Taliban territory and form a resistance movement against them. Karzai was elected president by a council of Afghan leaders. Certainly, he's a man with more leadership potential than many... more than Moore, for sure. \n \n 5) Moore shows two minutes of footage of how peaceful, happy, and utopian life in Iraq was before the evil Americans came in and messed everything up. \n This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen in my life. He shows kids flying kites and people sipping on tea in caf\u00e9s, then cuts to scenes of the US bombing Baghdad. What he doesn't tell you is that the building shown blowing up right afterwards is the Iraqi Ministry of Defense, where I assure you no kids were flying kites. There were probably mass genocides planned and directed in many of those buildings before we blew them to pieces. Besides, plenty of people are sipping on tea in caf\u00e9s right now in Iraq, who hated Saddam, who hate us, and who are probably laughing that Moore is making movies like this. What's his point?\n \n Since Moore closes his film with an Orwell quote, so will I.\n \n \"The quickest way of ending a war is to lose it.\"\n George Orwell\n Polemic, May 1946\n \"Second Thoughts on James Burnham\"\n \n This is what Moore would like more than anything else, since he hates America and thinks Americans are \"stupid pricks.\" What was the point of this film? He draws no conclusions -- instead, he puts out a bunch of carefully cut-and-pasted images and quotes and hopes you end up hating Bush, much like how Bush throws out \"Al-Qaeda,\" \"9/11\", \"Saddam,\" and \"WMD\" and hopes you put them all together. \n \n I am sick of seeing this hypocritical con man worshipped like a demigod. Please, do yourself a favor and don't believe his ****.\n \n \n 8:40 PM - 4 eprops - 2 comments - email it \n \n \n Saturday, June 26, 2004\n \n doc\u00b7u\u00b7men\u00b7ta\u00b7ry (dky-mnt-r)\n adj.\n \n \n Consisting of, concerning, or based on documents. \n Presenting facts objectively without editorializing or inserting fictional matter, as in a book or film.\n Source: The American Heritage\u00ae Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition\n Copyright \u00a9 2000 by Houghton Mifflin Company.\n Published by Houghton Mifflin Company.

   "Sunday, June 27, 2004\n \n LIES OF FAHRENHEIT 9/11 -- EXPOSED\n Outright lies\n \n 1) Riots during Bush's inauguration led him to cancel his plans to walk the last leg of his parade route.\n Bush did, in fact, walk the last leg of his parade. Here's a picture.\n\n \n Nice cut and paste from another's post :P And you thoughtlessly excluded other's posts where they refute what you say.\n \n Oh, your source  corrected that:\n \n\n CORRECTION: Bush did walk the last leg of his trip to the inauguration, but only upon reaching a relatively protester-free designated zone for $50 ticketholders. He did indeed have to cut his walk short due to protestors. The picture of Bush I have posted shows him at the parade after his inauguration. My mistake\n\n \n \n\n 2) The Saudis, with a $860 billion investment in American firms, own 7% of America.\n Not surprisingly, AMERICANS own the vast majority of America. The total value of all domestic assets held by American households and non-profit organizations in Q1 2004 is $55 trillion. \n \n The Saudis would be a drop in the bucket even if they DID have $860 billion here, but they don't. The total value of foreign investments in the US in 2002, the latest year statistics are available, was $8.58 trillion. \n\n \n Where is it where is it.... oh here it is:\n \nIncidentally, the current financial value of any foreign country to the US is not their fixed capital investment but their purchase of our treasury issues, all that keeps our leaky old boat afloat. On a balance sheet bonds are listed as a current asset to the holder, a current liability for the issuer and have zero to do with GDP. Foreign entities purchase 45% of all US treasury issues and the Sauds are a very important customer. \n\n \n \n\n 3) The US gave Bin Laden a 2-month head start before sending special forces after him.\n Yeah, right, like Moore knows exactly where our special forces troops are all the time. Besides, if we really wanted to make sure we didn't let any Al Qaeda troops escape, we'd have to send huge numbers of troops to Afghanistan immediately after Sept. 11 along with invading Pakistan in the process, which I'm sure Moore wouldn't be too happy about either. And where would those huge numbers of troops come from? Probably from places like Moore's hometown of Flint, Michigan, where Moore is so distraught about the military being the most attractive occupation. More on this later. \n\n \n And you know where our forces where? You're right, we should have sent enough troops to do the job right in Afghanistan, and Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia and other countries who actively help terrorists (incidently, this does not include Iraq, at least not on the scale of the others). That is, if we're seriously in a \"war on terror\".\n \n \n\n 4) Bush cut soldiers' pay by 33%.\n Bush may be dopey, but he's not stupid enough to slash the pay of the people he counts on most. Soldiers not only get their regular salaries, but also get added bonuses for things like housing, combat duty, deployment, etc. The Bush administration looked at trimming these bonuses back to their pre-war levels in an effort to save money. Soldiers protested, so the raised bonuses were extended until the end of FY2004 with the approval of both Bush and Congress.\n\n \n All the while cutting disability and other programs. Have you looked at exactly what the Bush Administration actually does for the soldiers?\n \n \n\n 5) Iraq under Saddam never threatened or harmed any Americans.\n Consider the following:\n -Fugitive terrorist Abdul Rahman Yasin, who mixed the explosives for the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, fled to Iraq shortly after his indictment and stayed there for several years.\n -Fugitive terrorist Abu Nidal was funded by Saddam and sheltered in Baghdad for years before Saddam changed his mind and expelled him in 1983 in an effort to please us. Abu Nidal was responsible for a wide variety of international terrorist attacks. \n -Fugitive terrorist Abu Abbas, responsible for the 1985 hijacking of the Achilles Lauro cruise liner in which a disabled American Jew was shot dead and thrown overboard, was sheltered in Baghdad until 2003 when invading American troops captured him. \n -Fugitive terrorist (notice a pattern here?) Abu Musab al-Zarqawi fled to Iraq from Afghanistan with two dozen Al-Qaeda terrorists in May 2002 and stayed to organize terror plots. He is now directing insurgent operations against American troops.\n -Iraqis held American (and non-American) hostages for months following its invasion of Kuwait in 1990, threatening to use them as human shields. \n -Iraqi intelligence agents were caught trying to kill former President Bush during a visit to Kuwait in 1993. In response, Bill Clinton ordered a cruise missile strike on Iraqi intelligence headquarters, killing nine civilians in the process. Where was Michael Moore then?\n -The Iraqi military for years shot at US and British aircraft enforcing no-fly zones.\n No, really. Saddam loved us. \n \n\n \n Saddam hated us. Saddam was a brutal dictator. From what I've seen, he's justified in hating us.\n \n \n\n Half-Truths\n \n 1) Bush spent the summer of 2001 fishing and golfing.\n He fished and golfed, but read here for the non-play stuff he did too.\n\n \n haha, the part in the movie where Bush was trying to come up with something official to do to tell the reporters was so funny. \"Uh... uh... initiatives, yeah...\". lol.\n \n \n\n 2) The war in Afghanistan was meant to complete a natural gas pipeline project, led by Unocal and Bush's family, connecting the Caspian Sea with Pakistan. They even went so far as to invite the Taliban to Texas.\n The pipeline project mentioned in the film did exist, and chauvinist Taliban representatives did meet with Unocal at their headquarters in Texas. However, Unocal was merely one competitor in this project. The Argentinian energy firm Bridas was also in the running. Moreover, when the deal was finally signed in May 2002, neither company would be involved. \n\n \n And, um, wasn't the new President of Afghanistan on the board of directors of Unocal?\n \n \n\n 3) Only one of Congress' 535 members has a child serving in Iraq. \n This is technically correct -- Senator Tim Johnson's son serves with the 101st Airborne. However, Senator Joseph Biden's son is in the Delaware National Guard, and -- ironically enough -- Attorney General John Ashcroft's son Andy is deployed in the Persian Gulf with the Navy. \n\n \n Oh my gosh, did Moore actually have a fact in his movie!! I guess from now on you can't say that the movie was all lies, eh? ;)\n \n \n\n 4) Afghanistan's army is the US Army.\n There are mostly US troops in Afghanistan, but there is a NATO force there comprised primarily of German and Canadian troops, as well as many other NATO countries. Moreover, the US Army is training the Afghan army, which already has over 7,000 troops. The Afghan army is helping to enforce security for the elections coming up there this fall, which never would've happened if Moore were in charge.\n\n \n ...ok, if you say so. I don't care enough about this to find out differently, and frankly don't remember this in the movie.\n \n \n\n 1) In late 2002, Michael Moore stated at a debate that he thought Bin Laden should be considered innocent until proven guilty -- therefore our invasion of Afghanistan was totally unjustified. Judging from his criticism that we sent too few troops into Afghanistan too late, he's apparently changed his mind about this.\n\n \n He decided that Bin Laden was indeed guilty? I agree that without proof Bin Laden should not have been the target. We apparently have proof.\n \n \n\n 2) Moore criticizes Bush for finishing his reading of a children's book once he heard the World Trade Center was under attack. What was he supposed to do? Cancel the event in the middle and storm out of the room ready to invade Afghanistan? Wouldn't that be spreading the \"aura of fear\" that Moore criticized Bush for creating? Wouldn't that have made Moore even more suspicious about Bush supposedly knowing the attack was coming? Wouldn't it have been better for Bush to just finish the stupid little book about the goat, politely say goodbye to the kids, and then get to work on the crisis (which is what he did)? \n\n \n I agree with you. What Bush did here was the only thing he should have done. While it might have made some difference to rush out and deal with the situation, staying 7 minutes to finish reading to the kids was not a bad thing. He might have been thinking what Moore said he was, but I still think he did the right thing.\n \n \n\n 3) Richard Clarke, Bush's former chief of counterterrorism, is one of Moore's heroes in the movie, talking about various intelligence failures and such. For example, Moore dwells on the fact that about two dozen members of Bin Laden's family were allowed to leave America shortly after 9/11. However, what Moore leaves out is that Richard Clarke himself claims he approved those flights, with the approval of the FBI, who had actually been spying on all of them for several years anyway and apparently decided they were not of any interest. \n\n \n Why in the world would they spend not little time and effort to get them all together from various parts of the country before other planes are allowed to fly and get them out, in an emergency situation when the resources would be far better used elsewhere. This by itself is very very suspicious and I have not heard a satisfactory answer to it.\n \n \n\n 4) Why doesn't Michael Moore donate all his profits from his films and speeches to charities that help wounded soldiers, if he's so concerned about them?\n\n \n I agree, he should donate to charities. I think anyone with a lot of money should.\n \n \n\n 5) Moore's pretty leftist -- but the long-suppressed leftists in Iraq and Afghanistan are quite in favor of our interventions there.\n\n \n er... ok? \n \n \n\n 6) James Bath was investigated for fraud committed when he was a director of the Bank of Credit and Commerce (BCCI). This investigation was conducted by a Senate team led by John Kerry.\n\n \n ???\n \n \n\n 7) Moore portrays American soldiers as bloodthirsty killers who like to napalm baby girls and then \"watch the mother****ers burn.\" Unless, of course, they're from Moore's hometown of Flint, Michigan, in which case they're simply innocent victims of poverty. \n\n \n I did not get that impression from the movie.\n \n \n\n 1) Donald Rumsfeld met with Saddam Hussein.\n This happened in late 1983, when Rumsfeld was chosen by the Reagan administration as an envoy to the Middle East. Rumsfeld had previously served in the Nixon and Ford administrations, and at the time was CEO of multinational pharmaceutical company GD Searle (now part of Pfizer), so he would not be an unusual choice as an envoy. \n \n Showing this clip in the film gives the viewer the impression that Rumsfeld was a member of some secret cabal of Americans who built up Saddam into a war machine. Rumsfeld was sent for a number of reasons. At the time, Iran and Iraq were in a serious war, and America feared Iran much more than it feared Iraq. Iran had kidnapped American hostages, and Iranian-backed militiamen had blown up the US Embassy and Marine barracks in Beirut, so Saddam was simply the least evil person to talk to. This is why we decided to look the other way when Saddam gassed Iran. Moreover, while the US did provide intelligence to Iraq, most of Iraq's actual military equipment came from France and Russia, so it is unfair to blame exclusively the US for militarizing Saddam. Those aren't American-made AK-47s they're shooting at us.\n\n \n I think the impression given was the truth. America aided Saddam. He was our best ally at the time, especially when he gassed the Kurds.\n \n \n\n 2) Bin Laden family ties with the Bush family, James Bath, and the Carlyle Group\n Moore shows how one of Osama Bin Laden's brothers was involved in investments with a guy named James Bath, and then goes on to explain that, because everyone in the Bin Laden family is related, they must know where Bin Laden is and might be harboring him. \n You have to remember that Osama Bin Laden has 53 siblings, born to 20 different mothers. Just because you're Osama Bin Laden's brother doesn't mean you know where he is, or even that you like him or have ever spent much time with him. In fact, in their family, each wife had a different house, and since Osama doesn't have any siblings by his own mother, he didn't get to know many of his siblings.\n \n Moreover, the Bin Ladens are a wealthy and powerful family in Saudi Arabia, having made its fortune in the construction industry. The Bushes are a wealthy and powerful family in America, having made its fortune in oil. Osama aside, it's not unexpected that these families might have some business contacts. \n\n \n And being President just makes it that much easier to get those business contracts to work out, I bet.\n \n \n\n If Bush really lives in the pockets of the Bin Ladens, and if the Bin Ladens love their brother so much, why have they allowed the US to pursue this \"War on Terror?\" Consider the following:\n -The Saudis were against the destruction of the Taliban. \n\n \n Were they destroyed? \n \n\n -The Saudis forced the US military to move its Mideast military headquarters to Qatar.\n\n \n This proves what?\n \n\n -The Saudis have a Shiite minority, unlike Iraq, whose Shiite majority was oppressed by Saddams Sunni minority. Now that Iraq's Shiites have been emboldened, Saudi Arabia has a new threat to its stability.\n\n \n How does this threaten their stability?\n \n\n -Iraq's oil industry has been jumpstarted, creating a potential competitor for the Saudi oil companies. \n\n \n Who's controlling the oil? Haliburton? The puppet gov't?\n \n\n -Violence in Saudi Arabia is reaching new highs, with foreign workers being kidnapped and whole neighborhoods being stormed and assaulted. \n\n \n How much do the royals care? How does this relate?\n \n\n -The Saudi government's image worldwide has been tarnished -- even in the Middle East itself -- as both Americans and Al Qaeda call for its destruction.\n\n \n As has the US image been tarnished. Has that stopped the oil or the money?\n \n \n\n Most telling of all, Saudi Arabia is NOT a member of the \"Coalition of the Willing.\" Why would this be if the Bush and Saud families were really so incestuous?\n\n \n Why would they be? They just want the money.\n \n \n\n 3) The Saudis gave Bush $1.4 billion. \n Listen carefully and you'll hear Moore say \"$1.4 billion to BUSH.... and his friends and associates and their companies.\" Since Bush has a bunch of rich friends working for a lot of different companies, investing $1.4 billion in all of their employers combined probably isn't as scary as it sounds. \n\n \n It depends :)\n \n \n\n 4) New Afghan President Hamid Karzai was an advisor to Unocal.\n This is true; Karzai spent 1996-97 advising Unocal on the pipeline mentioned in the movie. However, Moore's portrayal of Karzai as an oilman and a puppet isn't entirely true -- Karzai did have a life outside of Unocal. He spent the 1980s fighting against the Soviets. He is the chief of a Pashtun tribe in Afghanistan, and is a relative of the deposed king.

Karzai was elected president by a council of Afghan leaders. Certainly, he's a man with more leadership potential than many... more than Moore, for sure. \n\n \n haha I like the parting shot at Moore at the end, too.\n \n \n\n 5) Moore shows two minutes of footage of how peaceful, happy, and utopian life in Iraq was before the evil Americans came in and messed everything up. \n This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen in my life.

Besides, plenty of people are sipping on tea in caf\u00e9s right now in Iraq, who hated Saddam, who hate us, and who are probably laughing that Moore is making movies like this. What's his point?\n\n \n Actually, many people say how good it was in Iraq before the sanctions came into effect. Saddam was as brutal as he was because of those sanctions. He killed the Kurds because they were a well-financed and well-armed coup attempt.\n \n Here's something from another post:\n \nPeople like to demonise him now, but in all reality the sanctions are what turned him into a tyrant. Look at chalabi. Here is a guy who was caught planning the assasination of Hussein so he could seize power for himself and his punishment was being expelled form the country . You really think this fits with your charachterisation of saddam as somebody who indescriminatly killed anybody who spoke ill of him?\n\n \n -snip of stupidity-\n \n \n\n doc\u00b7u\u00b7men\u00b7ta\u00b7ry (dky-mnt-r)\n adj.\n \n \n Consisting of, concerning, or based on documents. \n Presenting facts objectively without editorializing or inserting fictional matter, as in a book or film.\n Source: The American Heritage\u00ae Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition\n Copyright \u00a9 2000 by Houghton Mifflin Company.\n Published by Houghton Mifflin Company.
