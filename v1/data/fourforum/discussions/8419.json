   "Jim Colyer", 
   "I met Veda Radanovich at Lonnie's Western Room in Printers Alley in Nashville in the summer of 2000. She was singing rock and country hits for admiring tourists. I was impressed with Veda's energy and stage presence. She bore a resemblance to Shania Twain. I was writing Shania-style songs and recording various female singers. I introduced myself to Veda and asked if she were interested in doing my songs. She answered in the affirmative. We went to Direct Image Recording Studio in Nashville, where I had been working with Kenny Royster. \n \n I LOOKED TWICE!\n \n http://jimcolyer.com/@/Music/_entries/11/sample.mp3 \n \n I walked in, and there he was on the stage \n The right looks, the right size, the right age \n I'm so burned out on good-looking guys \n I won't even let em catch my eyes \n I went to the bar, I got me a beer \n The band started playing, I didn't care \n I changed my mind \n When he started singing his song \n \n It wasn't love at first sight \n But, thank God, I Looked Twice! \n I looked below the surface \n And I liked what I saw \n I've had my share of tight fitting jeans \n I've had my share of late night scenes \n It wasn't love at first sight \n But I Looked Twice! \n \n The band took a break, he walked up to me \n He had charm, he had umph, he got me \n He knew just what to say and how to say it \n He said I'm his favorite song and he's gonna play it \n I found out what we've got in common \n A deep-seated need to share good loving \n Now I'm his lady \n And he's my Mister Right \n \n It wasn't love at first sight \n But, thank God, I Looked Twice! \n I looked below the surface \n And I liked what I saw \n I've had my share of tight fitting jeans \n I've had my share of late night scenes \n It wasn't love at first sight \n But I Looked Twice! \n \n solo \n \n I've had my share of tight fitting jeans \n I've had my share of late night scenes \n It wasn't love at first sight \n But I Looked Twice! \n It wasn't love at first sight \n But I Looked Twice! \n \n Jim Colyer ascap",
