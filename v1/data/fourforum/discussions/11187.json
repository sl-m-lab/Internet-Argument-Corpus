   "While I currently support a candidate in a major party, it appears unlikely that they will receive the nomination of that party, but I know this one will be on the ballot. \n \n Here are a few reasons why I support Pastor Baldwin:\n -Pro-Life, 100%\n -Wants to return to Constitutional Government\n -Wants to restore individual liberty\n -Likes the Gold Standard\n -Non-interventionist foreign policy\n -Phased elimination of the income tax (and the IRS)\n -Has always stood up for his beliefs strongly\n -Wants to restore our borders\n -Is against sovereignty destroying organizations like the UN, WTO, and NAFTA\n \n I know some will say I'm \"wasting my vote,\" but I don't look at it that way. I look at it as a way of supporting my principles, and I'd consider a vote for John Hillbama a wasted vote. Studies have alsofound that voting for minor party candidates is much more effective because they influence the policies of the actual politicians in DC (every vote counts).",
