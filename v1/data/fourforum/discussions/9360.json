He despised many aspects of organized religion, as well.\n\n \n No, if it allows for the existence of a Creator (and you are right that it does), it is absolutely NOT atheist, nor compatible with it.

Indeed, even in science there are methods of maintaining ethical standards. \n\n \n In cases where ethics exist in science, it is only because of influences outside science. And of course, the strongest proponent of such ethics is religion. But I never said morality can't exist outside of religion--some form of morality ALWAYS exists regardless. Man has ALWAYS known how to maintain morality outside religion, so that's nothing new. The issue however, is that religion is the better morality, at least Christianity in its pure form.\n \n \nReligion has a means to do so, and still does many times.
