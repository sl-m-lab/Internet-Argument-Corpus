   "Dominionism seems to revolve around the concept of \"eschatology\" (ie; The end is nigh!!!) This group believe that the 2nd coming of Jesus can only happen after *EVERY* country on the planet has been a Christian nation for a period of 1000 years (convienient round number). \n They are most active in the US though have groups across most of the planet.\n Most high profile is Patrick Henry College which \"educates\" homeschool dominionist kids and promotes them to political groups (Republican Party)\n Where their recent actions have included lobbying against homosexual marriage and against paying compensation to victims of Asbestos.\n \n Hopeless as their aim might be their capacity to do harm looks disasterous.",
