   "So, if YOU were president and YOU found out that YOU had been misinformed, to say the least, about WMDs, which was YOUR primary reason for throwing your country into a quagmire of a war, what would YOUR reaction be?\n \n How would YOU react if you found out that claims you had been fervently supporting were actually totally wrong? \n \n Would YOU be as cool as Bush has been? \n \n \n \n (Really, the question is, if Bush were being honest, and honestly believed the intellegence reports which later turned out to be bogus, would he say things like \"Well, we're going to take a hard look into this.\" Or would he blast the CIA, FBI, and just about every other agency involved for getting us into a big mess. Do you think Bush's reaction gives his dishonesty away?)",

(i know you dont assume that, im just saying...)\n \n there is loads of evidence that shows bush insisted on the fbi to only present information linking al qaeda to iraq, regardless of whether such links existed or not. it turns out that now everybody knows the truth, but bush cant act surprised because hes not.",
