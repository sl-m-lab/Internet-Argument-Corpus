   "Well I give a monkies about the Scottish Election, I will vote SNP.\n \n The best way to solve the 'West Lothian Question' is to break up the UK, that way we can never have Scottish MPs vote on purely English matters. :)\n \n On a more serious note those who want to save the Union should advocate some sort of Federal System for the UK. At the moment you have English Nationalists who feel they have been marginalised by Devolution in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. The English should have their own Parliament which has oversight on Education, Transport etc(the same powers as the Scottish Parliament) and the UK Parliament should only deal with Defence and Foreign Affairs. \n \n I don't see MPs voting for this however, it would be like the 'Turkey's voting for Christmas'\n \n We have actually been canvassed by the BNP as well, I think they are trying re-brand themselves as a genuine right wing party because of Cameron's Tories move to the Centre ground. I basically told the BNP activist where to go, that in no way I could ever support their Racist Agenda. I then ripped up their leaflet and threw it in the bin.",

Also the ballot papers are being counted electronically for the first time, some of the central machines that have collated results have failed, and this has resulted in delays in the counts in a few Constituencies.

   "I see as worrisome the present vigorous effort by the UK to plant alien Islam in Moldova. It's well-known fact that radical Islam owes its birth to British intelligence. It's been good enough leverage to pursue London's goals worldwide so far. \n IMHO presently British politicians are after reanimating Britain's potency through getting new colonies not so far away - in Europe - in so-called post-soviet space. Britain's untrumpeted success is introducing of Islam in Baltic states, Estonia and other. My friends living there are stayng in shock. Islamic organizations have been mushrooming lately there. Many of them have turned out to be just branches of the notoriously known Hizb-ut-Tahrir. According to many experts it's terrorist's beehive just! So terrorist centers under the guise of Islamic organizations and mosques are being planted in Baltic states. I suspect in Moldova they are planning same sort of thing. I wonder why is EU having a blind eye on it? \n Now Islamic Human Rights Commission based in Wembley, UK, voices concern over the 'Moldova Muslims' rights abuse'. FYI there are 3,000 Muslims or so in Moldova. They are mostly students from Near East. I suspect IHRC (surely sponsored by British intelligence) is going to use them as the fifth column to instigate violence here and then to meddle into the mess as the defender of 'oppressed Muslims'. The scenario is really bad. Just fancy those mosques in Moldova. They have always been breeding soil for radical Islamists.",
