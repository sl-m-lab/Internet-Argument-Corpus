   "The following is one person's opinion...\n \n Religious Addiction: Inner Peace Or Inner Turmoil?\n \n \n Religious beliefs serve an important function in the daily lives and attitudes of most of us. Especially in today's often chaotic and unpredictable world, a sincere faith in the power of God and adherence to religious rituals can give us better moral guidance, more emotional stability, and valuable serenity. Religion helps people to be centered and grounded.\n \n However, a person's fervent religious practices can signify other, darker aspects of his or her mental health. For example, if someone's faith is used to mask or avoid psychological problems, or if their religious inclinations are taken to extremes, there is an excellent possibility that the person is suffering from a psychiatric disorder. Often it is a way to cover their own pathology, hiding it from others or accusing others for being it's cause. This can be compared with Dual Diagnosis in Alcoholism, ie: sometimes when a person deals with their alcoholism and quits drinking, only then does their underlying psychiatric pathology become apparent. Alcohol in this situation was used to self-medicate. \n \n One term used to describe such a case is \"hyper-religiosity.\" A \"hyper\" condition of any sort-e.g. hyperactivity, hyperglycemia, etc.-simply means too much of something. In the case of religious beliefs, the question of having too much becomes a factor when the religion starts adversely affecting people's social behavior, their ability to function rationally, and even their own physical health.\n \n Being very religious is not by any means an absolute indication of bipolar or manic or depressive behavior; on the contrary, a healthy approach to religious rituals is vital for the comfort and well-being of countless people. So it's a highly sensitive issue to question someone's beliefs or practices. Nevertheless, anything taken too far can do more harm than good. \n ............................................................\n \n Loss of Objectivity\n Their ability to reason logically can become impaired. An inability to think, doubt, or question religious information and/or authority; and unwillingness to understand the opinions and interpretations of others. A concrete and rigid thinking style develops that does not allow for consideration of extenuating circumstances in a person's life. Black/white, good/bad, either/or simplistic thinking: one way or the other with very little room for grey areas. A tendency toward magical thinking that God will fix you/ do it all, without serious work on your part. Confusion and doubts lead to mental, physical or emotional breakdown. They develop a fear-based belief system.. believing/following a religion out of fear, not understanding and love. They also tend to have a shame-based belief system that they are not good enough or are not doing it right. They believe in a punishing and angry God. \n \n Reactivity: Anger and Defensiveness\n If sincere faith in God is supposed to bring peace and contentment, a religious person who is paranoid and confrontational about it may have a larger mental problem. They tend to have increased conflict and argumentation with science, medicine, and education. They tend to become argumentative and defensive in dialog. They have a limited ability to explain their beliefs. Since their belief system about themselves and the world is fear-based, they seldom understand religion, but follow it out of a dependent need for strength and power. Force is their farce.\n http://www.crescentlife.com/spirituality/religious_addiction.htm",

Especially in today's often chaotic and unpredictable world, a sincere rational outlook and adherence to rational views can give us better moral guidance, more emotional stability, and valuable serenity. Rationality and skepticism helps people to be centered and grounded.\n \n A person's fervent skeptical anti-religious views and practices can signify other, darker aspects of his or her mental health. For example, if someone's obsession with being anti-religious is used to mask or avoid psychological problems, or if their anti-religious inclinations are taken to extremes, there is an excellent possibility that the person is suffering from a psychiatric disorder. Often it is a way to cover their own pathology, hiding it from others or accusing others for being it's cause.

An inability to be kind, understanding, or or listen to religious information and/or authority; and unwillingness to understand the opinions and interpretations of others. A concrete and rigid thinking style develops that does not allow for consideration of extenuating circumstances in a person's life. Anti-religious black/white, good/bad, either/or simplistic thinking: one way or the other with very little room for grey areas. A tendency toward intolerance with people who worship God. Misunderstanding and obsession lead to mental, physical or emotional breakdown. They develop a cold, unrealistic self-reliance system.. believing/following their own 'rationality' to the point of obsession, not understanding and love. They also begin to mischaracterize religious people as having a shame-based belief system that they are not good enough or are not doing it right. They portray the beliefs of relgious people in an over-stating, often negative way.\n \n Reactivity: Anger and Defensiveness\n If sincere skepticism is supposed to bring peace and contentment, a skeptical person who is paranoid and confrontational about it may have a larger mental problem. They tend to have increased conflict and argumentation with faith, prayer, and Biblical teaching. They tend to become argumentative and defensive in dialog. They have a limited ability to explain their views. Since their belief system about themselves and the world is foolhardy, they seldom understand true skepticism, but follow it out of a dependent need for strength and power. Force is their farce.",

And I do think that SOME can turn their atheistic zeal into what you describe...\n But then again, some people balk at the idea of labelling \"atheism\" as a religion, so your dialogue would work well for that focus under that restriction.\n \n Anyways, I found the web-site's statements interesting as I had heard before that some people can turn one \"addiction\" into another, and that such a thing has been observed with turning one \"addiction\" into an \"addiction\" for religion.",

Religon, Abortion, creationism, etc... all have this same problem.\n \n Oddly enough, the best explanation I have ever seen for this (pathetic) phenomenon is in a steven king book called \"insomnia\". In the book he is talknig abotu abortion, but the underlying sentiment holds true for most of our truly polarizing issues.",
