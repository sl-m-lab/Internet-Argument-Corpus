   "On the home page of the Family Research Council (link and full article)\n \n 'Hate Crimes' Legislation Is Unconstitutional\n \n \nIn a move that is a direct violation of the 14th Amendment which affords equal protection under the law, the House of Representatives passed a \"hate crimes\" measure that would grant certain victims of crimes allegedly motivated by bias--greater protection than other victims of violence. The measure passed by a vote of 237 to 180.\n \n Family Research Council President Tony Perkins released the following statement: \"Criminalizing thoughts as well as actions, and creating special categories of victims is unconstitutional. The actions of a majority of the House today undermine the promise of equal protection under the law guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. This legislation creates second-class victims and a legal system of 'separate and unequal.'\n \n \"There has been no proof that violent crimes perpetrated against any of the groups listed in the bill have not been prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, yet now Congress is asking the federal government to get involved in issues that are, and should remain, local concerns.\n \n \"By far the most disturbing threat we face by this legislation - is the threat it poses to free speech and our religious liberties. In some jurisdictions that have adopted similar laws, 'hate crimes' have been defined to include not just physical acts of violence but merely verbal ones as well. When 'thought crimes' laws are interpreted this way, they pose a serious threat to freedom of speech and religious liberty.\n \n \"I strongly encourage people to let their Senators know to vote against this unconstitutional legislation and encourage President Bush to follow through with the White House statement issued today and veto any such measure should it reach his desk.\"\n\n \n \n emoticon_love the FRC\n \n \n They have such a lovely way with words. :xbanghead emoticon_mad",

They are trully and evil bunch that will find themselves in the lake of fire. They want to continue their unholy war against Gods gay and lesbian children. They want to continue to discriminate and distroy our lives.",

   "A bunch of conservatives who lack complete understanding of the first amendment should not be a politcal advocacy group. Lucky thing for gay folks is that the everyday common person does understand free speech. It is impossible not to when the Westboro Baptist Church is out protesting funerals and its has been a legal strong hold to stop them due to the first amendment.\n \n I think the FRC has done more FOR gay rights then AGAINST by this silly argument about Free Speech. Most see right though it.",

Father, protect us from the false prophets who claim to do your work. Father bring the light of understanding to those who have been blinded by those who hate us.

   "In a move that is a direct violation of the 14th Amendment which affords equal protection under the law, the House of Representatives passed a \"hate crimes\" measure that would grant certain victims of crimes allegedly motivated by bias--greater protection than other victims of violence. The measure passed by a vote of 237 to 180.\n\n You gotta love the \"allegedly\" placed in there. Gives the impression that you can just \"allege\" the motivation is by bias, and the person is guilty of a hate crime.\n Blatantly false.\n The \"hate crime\" motivation has to be proven TO THE SAME DEGREE that the ACTUAL CRIME has to be proven.\n In other words, if the burden of proof is \"beyond a shadow of a doubt\", then the jury has to find:\n a) That the defendant committed the crime beyond a shadow of a doubt, and\n b) that the defendant committed the crime motivated on prejudice against that specific characteristic, beyond a shadow of a doubt.\n \n Without both, it's not a hate crime.\n And with both, it's not \"alleged\". It's CONVICTION to the same degree of certainty that the guy actually committed the crime.\n \n \n \nFamily Research Council President Tony Perkins released the following statement: \"Criminalizing thoughts as well as actions, and creating special categories of victims is unconstitutional. The actions of a majority of the House today undermine the promise of equal protection under the law guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. This legislation creates second-class victims and a legal system of 'separate and unequal.'\n\n Glaringly false.\n 1) SCOTUS has already ruled on this issue. UNANIMOUSLY. It does not violate \"equal protection\".\n \n 2) \"Thoughts\" are not criminalized. Perkins wants you to overlook the fact that the assailant is being imprisoned BECAUSE HE COMMITTED A CRIME. (innocent until proven guilty, of course...)\n The MOTIVE for that crime is considered during the SENTENCING phase of the prosecution.\n And moreover, the motive has ALWAYS BEEN HISTORICALLY CONSIDERED during the sentencing phase of prosecution to determine what extent the punishment will be. Ergo, we have ALWAYS allowed \"thought crime\" prosecution, as Perkins wants to call it.\n All this legislation does is tell the judges sitting on the bench that a majority in society WANT this motive to be given a specific sentence. And that is entirely legal.\n \n 3) I'm curious. (Not really, but my sarcasm has a point...)\n Why the furor over this ONLY WHEN it's an issue of \"sexual orientation\" being added?\n I mean, we ALREADY HAVE hate crime legislation which covers religion, race, etc, etc. That's ALREADY on the books.\n EVERY ONE of his objections could equally be applied to those EXISTING laws.\n But it's ONLY NOW that \"sexual orientation\" is being added that they freak out.\n \n Kinda interesting, huh?\n \n \n \n\"By far the most disturbing threat we face by this legislation - is the threat it poses to free speech and our religious liberties. In some jurisdictions that have adopted similar laws, 'hate crimes' have been defined to include not just physical acts of violence but merely verbal ones as well. When 'thought crimes' laws are interpreted this way, they pose a serious threat to freedom of speech and religious liberty.\n\n I would love to see those laws.\n Of course, the FRC gives NO EXAMPLES of their claims...\n \n Another piece of this puzzle is that hate crime legislation ALREADY EXISTS IN MOST STATES. A lot of those states already have \"sexual orientation\" included.\n Ergo, can Perkins show us ANY example of his fears come to fruition?\n Or is this more preaching of fear to try and rally people against a non-existent threat? Another attempt to pretend that the anti-gay groups are \"victimized\", when the truth is that it is THEY who are espousing discrimination against gays?",
