   "I had a thought strike me a few days ago when thinking about the possibility of aliens existing. It deals with the possibility that aliens that are similar to humans existing somewhere in the galaxy.\n \n First a few assumptions have to be made. #1, if the Christian God exists then there probably are no aliens. Perhaps I'm wrong in making this assumption but I don't believe that God would have needed to create aliens. #2, the aliens are similar to humans in that they treasure power and are intellegent enought of follow a similar path of technological evolution as we have followed. Aliens are often portrayed and thought to be intellegent and human like in how they operate.\n \n First we should consider the likelihood of life forming on a given planet. It is almost 0 over any period of time. Now lets assume life does form on a given planet and it evolves to a level equal to humans. The humans level of civilization will inevitably cause 1 of 2 things. Either humans will kill themselves off or we will control the whole of the universe given only a few million years to work with. With the universe being billions of years old it really doesn't take a whole lot of time before an advanced species would be located at all corners of the universe. Since the universe is still here and relatively uninhabited we shall assume no advanced species has ever survived more than a few million years without destroying themselves. So the lifespan of an advanced form of life is very short compared to the time the universe has been around. This makes the probability of there being two advanced species around at the same time all the less likely and almost unbelievable.\n \n My conclusion is that it is essentially impossible that another form of advanced life exists in the universe today given my two assumptions. Even if two advanced forms of life did exist at one time the chance of them meeting is even more unlikely as is the idea that the two species will be anywhere near the same level of technology as the alien species were in the movie Signs and Independence Day.",

If structures in the universe have been given some godly purpose, then the trillion trillions of stars and potential planets around them would probably have SOMETHING of relevance.\n \n \n#2, the aliens are similar to humans in that they treasure power and are intellegent enought of follow a similar path of technological evolution as we have followed. \n \n \n I don't agree with this one either. There's no reason intelligent aliens would have to be obsessed with extremely advanced technology.\n \n \nFirst we should consider the likelihood of life forming on a given planet.

   "...this is a pretty big tangent.\n But anyways, I don't agree. If structures in the universe have been given some godly purpose, then the trillion trillions of stars and potential planets around them would probably have SOMETHING of relevance.\n\n \n They have relevance right now. They provide us with a star filled sky at night and may one day provide us with other homes and worlds to explore. I believe that if God created the universe then we will find aliens on other planets just as we find other creatures living here on Earth only they will not be advanced.\n \n \nI don't agree with this one either. There's no reason intelligent aliens would have to be obsessed with extremely advanced technology.\n\n \n Could they become advanced without having any drive to become advanced? Currently the humans are the only species on Earth to ever have a drive to become technologically advanced. If we look at all the other species who haven't tried to become technologically advanced we can see that they never did achieve any significant amount of technology.\n \n \nBased on what?\n\n \n I'm basing this more on other peoples works than my own. The reading I've done has suggested many times that there is only a small probability that life ever could have spawned on a forgiving planet such as Earth much less on the more typical planets. I'm sure the creationists will jump right in and agree with this.\n \n \nlol, what?\n Create impossible technology or die are the only two options?\n\n \n Impossible technology? I'm not sure what you mean by that. Anyways given enough time what do you think would be the final result of what mankind would do to the universe if they didn't destroy themselves?\n \n \nWe don't know the universe is relatively uninhabited. We have explored, what? 1 planet and 1 moon?\n\n \n We don't know this and it probably isn't uninhabited. What I am suggesting is that there is little chance that it is inhabited with another advanced form of life.",

Why is it unrealistic to expect anyone to construct a spacecraft which can travel at the speed allowing easy travel between stars? Anyways, given 1 million more years how many of the trillions of stars do you think humans will explore and study? Chances are that eventually we will just send out inexpensive robotic ships to explore the many stars of this universe to find better homes and search out other forms of life. I think given 1 million years we will have searched trillions of stars just as aliens would.",
