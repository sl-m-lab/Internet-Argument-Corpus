   "Bove, a widely followed banking analyst on Wall Street, calls Dodd-Frank \"the dumbest piece of legislation ever created by the U.S. Congress. They wanted the big banks to have less control, yet they built in rules that ensure the increased control of the financial sector by big banks.\" The hundreds of new regulations drive up the cost structure of banking, as do new capital and liquidity requirements. The new law even reduced some of the modest profit centers for small and medium-sized banks, such as overdraft fees, Bove says. \"And there is nothing in Dodd-Frank that will do anything to stop a meltdown from occurring.\"\n\n \n I couldn't agree more.\n \n This is from an article in the National Journal today. \n NationalJournal.com - The Resurrection - Tuesday, March 29, 2011\n \n Basically the entire article talks about how the big banks have only gotten bigger from our last financial disaster and all they learned is that it is better to invest in overseas markets than domestically. \n \n In other words, we have reinforced our position that it is better to pass paper back in forth with higher numbers on them and then invest in derivatives that assume that paper will fail than to have a bank that makes money via the old fashioned way...interest payments.\n \n Read the article, it makes a strong case for why we are basically in the same boat.",

Look at the US. With our deficts, debt load, and distribution of wealth, I view any investment in the US as high risk.

Any country who's biggest and most profitable industry is \"investing\" is bound to fail. \n\n \n I had breakfast the other day with the guy who runs the bank where I keep my personal accounts. It is a single location bank...no branches...small town, you walk in and the teller already knows who you are. They are not big enough to fund anything really big, but they handle local car loans and mortgages and some small business stuff. \n \n So we are now left with ALL the risk and none of the reward. At least before we had the \"reward\" until it caved in on itself. [/quote]\n \n I have been following both the bank overhaul program and the efforts to wind down fannie may and freddie mac. One thing that gets me about the whole process is how disconnected banks have become from any kind of actual banking activity. The other day there were several bankers on TV saying that if we went ahead with some of the suggestions that require that banks retain some of the risk on the mortgages that they originate, no bank would be willing to originate mortgages. \n \n Exactly what business do these guys think they are in???? 15 years ago if you had told a banker he was expected to retain 5% of the risk on a mortgage he would look at you like you were on crack, because they typically retained 100% of mortgage risk. Now having to retain 5% would push all the banks out of the mortgage lending game?? \n \n \nGreenspan had an article today where he was worried the derivatives market would go 100% overseas. Apparently in his mind this is a problem. He might be right though. If they go overseas that doesn't necessarily mean the risk transfers with it. If Citi does some of the same crazy interest rate swap BS that no one truly understands and it collaspes again it still seems to me the US is on the hook for that. \n\n \n There is an answer for that. When they do the interest rate swap BS, you get federal regulators in there that say \"This is BS...you are going to prison\". Personally I find it absolutely amazing that for all intents and purposes 6 banks crashed the entire world financial system, and NOBODY WENT TO JAIL. The stuff those guys were doing was absolutely unbelievable. It was INSANE....and nobody went to jail. \n \n Granted what they basically did was so incredibly outlandish that we did not have laws specifically against those activities, which is why we need a law against general asshattery in the financial world. \n \n \nAre they or are they just conducting their risky business practices elsewhere while staying attached to mommy should the deal go south?\n \n Either way, not good for the US.\n\n \n Personally I would be thrilled to see them out of the country completely, and certainly agree that moving all their lending offshore while still expecting to be able to have uncle moneybags bail them out when they do something mind numbingly stupid is a crock. \n \n There are not that many good investment opportunities in the US, though. Part of it is the fact that we are a failing superpower with a bankrupt government. Part of it is the fact that artificial interference in financial markets has created massive distortions that need time for ugly corrections. \n \n Look at the housing market. In an effort to make homes more affordable, they completely overlooked the most basic way to do so, by making them cheaper, and went straight to changing the way they are financed. This allowed more people to buy homes, but also drove up their cost, where we ended up in this ridiculous situation where homes go up in value as they get older. This is essentially due to disconnecting price from payment....it does not matter what you can afford, it matters what you can make the payment on. \n \n We also have a real problem when it comes to wealth distribution that comes into play here. A large part of the derivatives market, and most of the rest of the US financial system, boils down to inventing things for the wealthy to invest in, because there is not enough wealth left in the bottom 80% for traditional investments to take all the investment capital available to even the top 1%, much less the top 20%. So we end up in a situation where these ridiculous financial instruments get created that have no social utility, provide no real economic value, and yet they are the basis of our financial system because there is nothing else.",
