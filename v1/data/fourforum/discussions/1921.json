   "okay here's something to debate... are Americans attracted to stupidity? Bush appeals to many because he appears to be \"just a normal guy.\" Why are these people voting for some ordinary joe? Here's an idea: at the core, it's for selfish ego-boosting reasons-- it's because Americans don't like voting for someone who appears to be \"superior\" to themselves. (think of when Gore got BLASTED for saying he helped start the internet etc.) It's almost like people get OFFENDED when someone is just too smart, went to an ivy league school, etc. (I just heard there's a new bush ad making fun of Kerry's ivy league education etc... What's WRONG with having an good education?!) Is this something about american culture/how kids are raised here? \n \n On another bushy note, has anyone seen the website www.dirtydonuts.com? I just bought a clever anti-bush T shirt from their site and it's frickin awesome, I'm trying to decide whether to wear it to the office...",

   "I think there is actually a good reason to have a president in office who is an ordinary joe and that is because he is somewhat more in touch with the average person than someone who feels superior to those who he leads. If Kerry really does believe that he is better than us then there is no way that he will be a good leader.",

Also, he does what he says he will (unlike a certain democratic candidate *cough* *cough*). If anything, I'd rather have a guy like that in office then a career politician.",

And I don`t think you would have to be very inteligent to do that.

   "Joe Average, when elected, isn't going to have ties to Mr.Big who is the CEO of corporate leaders. The general mindset is, if joe average gets elected, he is going to know what its like to be poor or an average citizen, so he'll do what is best because he was \"one-of-the-guys\" and feels what it is like to be screwed by big-spending tax-breaking law-buying CEOs. And intellectuals have classical music, big words, and ussually high incomes, but joe average is, in respect, rocken, slang-term people, the thing that unfortunatly connects the middle and low classes is, they are too dumb to reach the higher classes, and in effect, someone who is acting dumb is percevied as \"one-of-us\" because stupidity is the hall-mark of \"hickville\", \"Middle and lower class ville\" and \"Meat-packing town anynomous ville\" and if he's stupid, he obviously can't be an aristrocrate and therefore won't screw us.",

While Bush appears to lead the group, Rainwater makes clear that Rose is to control how the business is run. Bush's stake in the $86 million deal is 2%, financed with a $500,000 loan from a Midland Bank of which he had been a director and $106,000 from other sources.

The Rangers put up no cash but finance their share through a ticket surcharge. From the team's operating revenues, the city will earn a maximum of $5 million annually in rent, no matter how much the Rangers reap from ticket sales and television (a sum that will rise to $100 million a year). Another provision permitts the franchise to buy the stadium after the accumulated rental payments reached a mere $ 60 million. The property acquired so cheaply by the Rangers includes not just a fancy new stadium with a seating capacity of 49,000 but an additional 270 acres of newly valuable land. Legislation is passed and signed that authorizes the Arlington Sports Facilities Development Authority with power to issue bonds and exercise eminent domain over any obstinate landowners.

Total pages of the four books: 1,762\n * \"When I was coming up, it was a dangerous world and you knew exactly who they were. It was us versus them and it was clear who them was. Today we are not so sure who the they are, but we know they're there.\" -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush, presidential candidate.\n * \"Food on the family.\" -- George W. Bush listing one of the priorities of his future administration.\n * \"This is Preservation month. I appreciate preservation. This is what you do when you run for president. You've got to preserve.\" -- George W. Bush to several hundred children at an elementary school in Nashua that was celebrating what it called Perseverance Month (not Preservation Month).\n * \"Is your children learning?\" -- George W. Bush on education.\n * \"Some people have too much freedom.\" -- George W. Bush\n * \"The Grecians.\" -- George W. Bush on Greek people.\n * \"What I'm against is quotas. I'm against hard quotas, quotas that basically delineate based upon whatever. However they delineate, quotas, I think, vulcanize society.\" -- George W. Bush, meaning to say \"balkanize,\" not \"vulcanize\" -- we think -- and something about quotas (Austin American-Statesman 3/23/99).\n * \"Sitting down and reading a 500-page book on public policy or philosophy or something.\" -- George W.

Bush in the November presidential elections, but a winner is unable to be declared because the outcome depends upon a state of Florida recount that must made, according to Florida law, since the eventual winner will have a majority of less than 1% of the vote. Many of the counties do not do a recount, but simply re-report their first results. Other counties decide to accept late overseas ballots, contrary to Florida law. Bush enlists James Baker to oversee his post-campaign Florida campaign. Although Jeb, as Florida governor, recuses himself from official state participation in the recount, phone records later made public lead observers to question that statement. The Florida Supreme Court directs that the entire state must physically recount all of the votes, but the U.S. Supreme Court overrules, declaring George W. Bush the victor in order to protect our tradition of the smooth transition of power. The vote was 5-4. Although the court ruled that the decision could never be used as precedent in any future legal case, it was determined that allowing the State of Florida to recount its votes, even though it is legally required to do so, would not be in the best interest of George W. Bush's presidential aspirations. On the basis of the Supreme Court's decision, Bush was declared the victor in Florida, thus winning the majority of electoral votes and thus being elected the nation's 43rd president.\n \n 2001 Bush is sworn in as president and Dick Cheney, Sec. of Defense under Poppy, is sworn in as vice-president.

   "I don't think Joe American dislikes rich people, and I don't think he dislikes intelligent people. After all, if you identify with poor people or stupid people, a consequence is that it will be hard to get friends with money or knowledge, respectively. If you identify with something, Why would you choose to identify with poverty or stupidity? It is after all more rewarding to be on the rich team or the intelligent team. To the extent people identify with their class or social peers, I would say it is more the result of the behavior of wealthy snobs and intellectual snobs, respectively. I think John Edwards' approach was a clever one. Talk about how there needs to be one America, rather than talking about how the rich are screwing over the poor. I should have thought that is what Joe American wants. Similarly, a politically better approach would be to stress the importance of bringing academia and the average person closer together, rather than to stress that academicians tend to be out of touch.\n \n All that said, there might be something to Americans as a whole caring less for education than Europeans. People who value education greatly tend not to emigrate to the wild wilderness America was just a short time ago, and many Americans have inherited the same qualities that these immigrants tended to have--an independent spirit and bravery on the one hand, but social boorishness and indifference to education on the other. And descendants of African slaves, though not descendants of voluntary immigrants, obviously have reasons to hate the predominantly white culture that operates most schools, and so black Americans too probably don't tend to be especially interested in education.",

You don't, and the reason is that what you're saying is not true. Have there been civilian casualties? Absolutely, that is inescapable in warfare, especially when you're fighting against enemies who use human shields.\n \n Bush didn't kill hunderds of American soldiers. We have an all volunteer military, these people volunteered for military service understanding they could be deployed anywhere to conduct combat operations against any enemy. You cannot find an enemy more deserving of having bombs dropped on them than the Baathists and Saddam.\n \n Do you think that Bill Clinton's immorality extends only to some 'hankypanky' in the Oval Office? How about the fact that the guy lied directly to the American people on more than one occasion? How about in 1993, how he sent Task Force Ranger to Somalia and then repeatedly denied requests made by the Task Force commander for armored support (like Bradleys) and close air support (AC-130 Spectre gunships). Then, after they lose 18 soldiers in a street fight in Mogadishu but accomplish their mission of abducting Aidid's lieutenants, Clinton within one month pulled out all US troops and released the people they had captured. Yeah, to me that's immoral.\n \n WMDs. Christ, everyone knew he had them. It wasn't just Bush saying he had them. John Kerry, in a 2003 speech, said he believed that Iraq had WMDs, that Hussein's rogue nation was a threat, and if you didn't believe that, you shouldn't vote for him. The Senate intelligence committee believed he had them. The UN believed he had them.\n \n The problem with many of you people is that the only argument you have is that you hate George Bush, and yet you can produce no strong evidence to support any of the groundless accusations and hatred you throw at him.\n \n Just answer the question I asked, who do you think is more moral?

   "Good website Dmann, it seems relatively credible. It's absolutely disgusting that so many innocents have lost their lives, but you need to look at how they died. A very good amount of them most likely died as a result of homemade explosive planted and detonated by anti-American terrorist groups.\n \n Actually, Comedian, Bush is getting a ton of blame and essentially no praise. In three years, he has successfully brought down 2 evil governments, is responsible for the death or capture of dozens of enemy leaders, and what's more, then stuck around to try and set up democracies. By the way, the economy is doing wonderful right now, despite what the liberal media claims.

We know that he is doing everything he can to build nuclear weapons, and we know that each day he gets closer to achieving that goal.\" -- John Edwards, Oct 10, 2002 \n \n \"The debate over Iraq is not about politics. It is about national security. It should be clear that our national security requires Congress to send a clear message to Iraq and the world: America is united in its determination to eliminate forever the threat of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.\" -- John Edwards, Oct 10, 2002 \n \n \"I share the administration's goals in dealing with Iraq and its weapons of mass destruction.\" -- Dick Gephardt in September of 2002 \n \n \"Iraq does pose a serious threat to the stability of the Persian Gulf and we should organize an international coalition to eliminate his access to weapons of mass destruction. Iraq's search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to completely deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as Saddam is in power.\" -- Al Gore, 2002 \n \n \"We are in possession of what I think to be compelling evidence that Saddam Hussein has, and has had for a number of years, a developing capacity for the production and storage of weapons of mass destruction.\" -- Bob Graham, December 2002 \n \n \"Saddam Hussein is not the only deranged dictator who is willing to deprive his people in order to acquire weapons of mass destruction.\" -- Jim Jeffords, October 8, 2002 \n \n \"We have known for many years that Saddam Hussein is seeking and developing weapons of mass destruction.\" -- Ted Kennedy, September 27, 2002 \n \n \"There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein's regime is a serious danger, that he is a tyrant, and that his pursuit of lethal weapons of mass destruction cannot be tolerated. He must be disarmed.\" -- Ted Kennedy, Sept 27, 2002 \n \n \"I will be voting to give the president of the United States the authority to use force - if necessary - to disarm Saddam Hussein because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security.\" -- John F. Kerry, Oct 2002 \n \n \"The threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real, but as I said, it is not new. It has been with us since the end of that war, and particularly in the last 4 years we know after Operation Desert Fox failed to force him to reaccept them, that he has continued to build those weapons. He has had a free hand for 4 years to reconstitute these weapons, allowing the world, during the interval, to lose the focus we had on weapons of mass destruction and the issue of proliferation.\" -- John Kerry, October 9, 2002 \n \n \"(W)e need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal, murderous dictator, leading an oppressive regime. We all know the litany of his offenses. He presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation. ...And now he is miscalculating America's response to his continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction. That is why the world, through the United Nations Security Council, has spoken with one voice, demanding that Iraq disclose its weapons programs and disarm. So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real, but it is not new. It has been with us since the end of the Persian Gulf War.\" -- John Kerry, Jan 23, 2003 \n \n \"We begin with the common belief that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region. He has ignored the mandates of the United Nations and is building weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them.\" -- Carl Levin, Sept 19, 2002 \n \n \"Every day Saddam remains in power with chemical weapons, biological weapons, and the development of nuclear weapons is a day of danger for the United States.\" -- Joe Lieberman, August, 2002\n \n \"As a member of the House Intelligence Committee, I am keenly aware that the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons is an issue of grave importance to all nations. Saddam Hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process.\" -- Nancy Pelosi, December 16, 1998 \n \n \"Even today, Iraq is not nearly disarmed. Based on highly credible intelligence, UNSCOM [the U.N. weapons inspectors] suspects that Iraq still has biological agents like anthrax, botulinum toxin, and clostridium perfringens in sufficient quantity to fill several dozen bombs and ballistic missile warheads, as well as the means to continue manufacturing these deadly agents. Iraq probably retains several tons of the highly toxic VX substance, as well as sarin nerve gas and mustard gas. This agent is stored in artillery shells, bombs, and ballistic missile warheads. And Iraq retains significant dual-use industrial infrastructure that can be used to rapidly reconstitute large-scale chemical weapons production.\" -- Ex-Un Weapons Inspector Scott Ritter in 1998",

Sounds like you're trying to sell a bathroom cleaner, or douche. \n You post is oddly uneducated  and out of touch. I don't know ANYONE who would refer to Bush as capable of talking without prompting of some kind. And let's point out something else as well. Bush was elected by about 21% of the potenbtial voters. half the country didn't vote, and about 23% voted for Gore and the rest voted for Nader and other independant candidates. \n Maybe in your imaginary world, Bush is literate and intelligent. Maybe in your world the fact that he was able to steal the elections  using conservative supreme court judges to his advantage....and paying them pack later.\n\n \n One more time!  There was no theft of the election. Gore received more popular votes than Bush, but lost the electoral votes. The votes in Florida were counted, recounted and recounted, BY THE DEMOCRATS, each time yielding a wider margin in favor of Bush. Their attempt to ignore the overseas military votes failed also.\n \n The judges used proper judgement in deciding to stop the madness of yet another recount and properly gave the state to Bush. That put him in as the duly elected winner of the election.\n \n Maybe if Gore had won his own home state, he'd be President right now. If the author of your first long post here (the orange tripe) subjected Gore to a similar examination of his family history, he would have fared worse that the Bushs.\n \n Similar elections have happened before (1888, I think.) where the most popular votes lost to the most electoral votes. It's the American way.\n \n \n \n Look at a county map of the election results and see how many square miles of the country contained people voting mostly for Bush. Gore could carry only the large metropolitan areas.\n \n Thank God for the electoral college. Were it not for it, this whole country would be run by the mass of progressive/liberal/socialist citizens Los Angeles, Chicago and New York.\n \n Bush stole nothing.\n \n ...and before you accuse someone again of being uneducated, you should learn how to spell.\n \n It's speech!",

Our investigation suggest the answer lies in... a very expensive contract between Governor Jeb's division of elections and a private company named DBT, which accidentally wiped off the voter rolls thousands of Democratic voters...\"\n \n \"...the first list from DBT included 8,000 names from Texas supplied by George Bush's state officials. They said they were all felons, serious criminals barred from voting. As it turns out, almost none were. Local officials raised a ruckus and DBT issued a new list naming 58,000 felons. But the one county which went through the whole expensive process of checking the new list name by name found it was still 95% wrong.\"\n \n (btw, as the article shows, the vast majority of the \"felons\" were African-American Democrats, including a minister who is interviewed in this report.)\n \n \"Did Governor Jeb Bush, his Secretary of State Katherine Harris, and her Director of Elections, Clayton Roberts, know they had wrongly barred 22,000 black, Democrat voters before the elections? After the elections did they use their powers to prevent the count of 20,000 votes for the Democrats? The Democrats say the answers to both questions are yes.\"\n \n and later\n \n \"Altogether, it looks like this cost the Democrats about 22,000 votes in Florida, which George Bush won by only 537 votes.\"\n \n So, let's just end this little \"bush won the election\" idea right here shall we.\n \n \n btw fyi here's where I got that BBC link:\n www.dirtydonuts.com/links.htm\n Some other nice little \"shocking\" articles can be found there... anyone who's thinking of voting for bush should definitely give em a read.\n \n On a site note... does anyone else feel that American reporting is generally unthorough?

Can you back it up with sources?\n\n \n \n \n Why yes, yes I can... \n \n Also note that kerry conviently does not recall.... \n \n \n \"WASN'T A CRIME COMMITTED HERE?\n \n And I'm talking about a crime committed by John Kerry. A serious crime.\n \n We haven't mentioned this before ... but there was a meeting of the Vietnam Veterans Against the War in in Kansas City in November of 1971. At that meeting there was a plan discussed to assassinate members of Congress. Now ... let's emphasize this point. These anti-war Vietnam veterans were sitting there and discussing murder .. they were discussing the idea of murdering certain members of the Congress of the United States who were in favor of the Vietnam war. Well ... the idea was discussed, and the idea was rejected. \n \n The reports of that Kansas City meeting are disturbing enough. It gets more disturbing when you consider the fact that our not-yet-crowned Democratic candidate for president was a member of that organization. Things get even more interesting when you learn that Kerry was present and a participant in that meeting. Yes ... John Kerry was there while his leftist anti-war colleagues were discussing murdering members of congress.\n \n Now when these reports first came out the sKerry campaign was quick to respond by saying that sKerry \"never ever\" attended that meeting of the Vietnam Veterans Against the War, and that he had resigned the organization months earlier. Uh oh ... big oops. It seems that the FBI was interested in the activities of these veterans at that time, and they were being watched. More particularly, sKerry was being watched. The FBI records of that Kansas City meeting show that our presumptive Democratic nominee was at that meeting. No wiggle room ... he was there. Now it seems that the sKerry campaign lied when they said he wasn't.\n \n Time to backtrack. Since the FBI has surveillance records showing Kerry present at that meeting, the Kerry folks need to conjure up a new statement. So now his campaign is releasing a statement saying that sKerry \" .. had no personal recollection of this meeting .... [but] if there are valid FBI surveillance reports .... we accept that historical footnote in the account of his work to end the difficult and divisive war.\" \n \n \"Historical footnote?\" The participation by a presidential candidate in a discussion about murdering U.S. Senators and Congressmen is a \"historical footnote?\" John Kerry's presence at and participation in this meeting is an \"account of his work to end the difficult and divisive war?\"\n \n We're supposed to be satisfied with the revelation that Kerry wasn't particularly fond of the assassination proposals, and that resigned from the Vietnam Veterans against the war soon after that meeting. That's it? He resigned? Well big whoop! You're sitting there at a meeting listening to your colleagues plan the murder of elected officials ... and you merely resign? Hey! How about going to the police? How about telling the FBI that you just heard some people discussing a plot to murder members of Congress? Isn't it a crime to become aware of such a discussion and fail to report it to authorities?\n \n I know ... we've been through this before ... but what if we were reading stories about a Republican presidential candidate who was present at a meeting where the murder of liberal Supreme Court Justices was discussed. Would we be satisfied to learn that the Republican candidate rejected the idea and then disassociated himself from the group having the discussion? Come on. We all know what would be happening now. The Democrats and their loyal media myrmidons would be howling in outrage. There would be demands for investigations ... criminal investigations ... and suggestions that the Republican candidate be charged with aiding and abetting an assassination plot. Believe me, it would be a major story.\n \n With Kerry and his anti-war pals ... no media outrage. No demands for investigations into that Kansas City meeting and any role that sKerry played. Nothing. You might hear about it on Fox News, and you might read about it in the Drudge Report --- but that's pretty much it. \n \n This story won't get any traction in the mainstream DC and New York press corps because it doesn't serve the personal aims of the people who would carry it to the forefront. Well over 90% of the people who are in a position to ask these questions about Kerry's involvement in that Kansas City meeting, and his actions (or lack thereof) afterwards, want Kerry to beat George Bush in November. If someone else pushes this story into the limelight, they'll groan a bit and give it a degree of due diligence. They're just as happy, though, to see it just go away.\n \n So here's what you have to ask yourself. Do you want a president who once overheard a discussion about assassinating members of Congress ... and then did nothing about it? \n \n Think about it. November is getting closer.\"",

Sadly, probably more than that.\n \n Dmann, I didn't ask how many Iraqi civilians were killed. I don't dispute the number...I just dispute different aspects of that number. How many did American forces directly kill? How many were killed in roadside bombs? How many have been killed in clashes of warring factions? How many were 'civilians' which were shooting at Americans? That number doesn't tell you the whole story, chief.\n \n And yeah, I wouldn't go posting links to liberal propoganda websites as factual sources of information. You seem pretty bright, even if I do disagree with you on most things. You should be able to come up with something more reliable.",

   "Trucker dude, here's an example of how Bush's nice little connections helped him \"win.\" Note the pretttyyy legitimate source, the BBC.\n \n http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/events/newsnight/1174115.stm\n \n Here are some snippets from that site to let you know what it's about<b></b>:\n \"We want to know whether George W Bush won the election or did brother Jeb steal it for him? Our investigation suggest the answer lies in... a very expensive contract between Governor Jeb's division of elections and a private company named DBT, which accidentally wiped off the voter rolls thousands of Democratic voters...\"\n \n \"...the first list from DBT included 8,000 names from Texas supplied by George Bush's state officials. They said they were all felons, serious criminals barred from voting. As it turns out, almost none were. Local officials raised a ruckus and DBT issued a new list naming 58,000 felons. But the one county which went through the whole expensive process of checking the new list name by name found it was still 95% wrong.\"\n \n (btw, as the article shows, the vast majority of the \"felons\" were African-American Democrats, including a minister who is interviewed in this report.)\n \n \"Did Governor Jeb Bush, his Secretary of State Katherine Harris, and her Director of Elections, Clayton Roberts, know they had wrongly barred 22,000 black, Democrat voters before the elections? After the elections did they use their powers to prevent the count of 20,000 votes for the Democrats? The Democrats say the answers to both questions are yes.\"\n \n and later\n \n \"Altogether, it looks like this cost the Democrats about 22,000 votes in Florida, which George Bush won by only 537 votes.\"\n \n So, let's just end this little \"bush won the election\" idea right here shall we.\n \n \n btw fyi here's where I got that BBC link:\n \n www.dirtydonuts.com/links.htm\n \n Some other nice little \"shocking\" articles can be found there... anyone who's thinking of voting for bush should definitely give em a read.\n \n On a site note... does anyone else feel that American reporting is generally unthorough? Doesn't BBC always seem so much more in depth? I could start a whole new thread here: Americans are impatient and their attention spans can only handle easily-digested information that comes in bite-sized but unwholesome packets. (can't wait to see all my ******-off replies ) emoticon_xgood\n\n \n We American readers are not the ones who produce the sound bite news stories heard on the network news broadcasts. The sound bites are short so the network will have time for the commercials! Our attention spans have nothing to do with the validity of reported news.\n \n There are lengthy, in-depth current events shows that air on public service stations. These get into the story behind the news.\n \n Unfortunately the BBC leans to the left nowadays. Also, the text in that link reads like a script of a satirical play. It's hard to determine what's truthfully reported and what is not. \n \n Also, when giving answers to the questions, they write \"The Democrats say...\". Well, what do you expect the Democrats to say? \n \n Had I seen an actual broadcast of the \"interviews\", I might have come closer to believing it was not choreographed.\n \n The donut site is obviously anti-Bush and subject to sketicism.",

KERRY: &#8220;George, I said at the time I would have preferred if we had given diplomacy a greater opportunity, but I think it was the right decision to disarm Saddam Hussein, and when the President made the decision, I supported him, and I support the fact that we did disarm him.&#8221; (ABC News, Democrat Presidential Candidate Debate, Columbia, SC, 5/4/03)\n \n \n \n Kerry Later Claimed He Voted &#8220;To Threaten&#8221; Use Of Force In Iraq. &#8220;I voted to threaten the use of force to make Saddam Hussein comply with the resolutions of the United Nations.&#8221; (Sen.

Are you one of the anti-war candidates?&#8221; KERRY: &#8220;I am -- Yes, in the sense that I don&#8217;t believe the president took us to war as he should have, yes, absolutely.&#8221; (MSNBC&#8217;s &#8220;Hardball,&#8221; 1/6/04)\n \n \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Round 2: Kerry Flip-Flopped On Eliminating Marriage Penalty For Middle Class\n \n \n \n Kerry Said He Will Fight To Keep Tax Relief For Married Couples. &#8220;Howard Dean and Gephardt are going to put the marriage penalty back in place.

One such matter is the proposed Constitutional amendment that would prohibit or seriously inhibit any legal recognition whatsoever of same-sex relationships. We believe it would be a grave error for Massachusetts to enshrine in our Constitution a provision which would have such a negative effect on so many of our fellow residents. &#8230; We are therefore united in urging you to reject this Constitutional amendment and avoid stigmatizing so many of our fellow citizens who do not deserve to be treated in such a manner.&#8221; (Sen. John Kerry, et al, Letter To Members Of The Massachusetts Legislature, 7/12/02)\n \n \n \n Now, In 2004, Kerry Won&#8217;t Rule Out Supporting Similar Amendment. &#8220;Asked if he would support a state constitutional amendment barring gay and lesbian marriages, Kerry didn&#8217;t rule out the possibility. &#8216;I&#8217;ll have to see what language there is,&#8217; he said.&#8221; (Susan Milligan, &#8220;Kerry Says GOP May Target Him On &#8216;Wedge Issue,&#8217;&#8221; The Boston Globe, 2/6/04)\n \n \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Round 6: Flip-Flopped On Attacking President During Time Of War\n \n \n \n In March 2003, Kerry Promised Not To Attack President When War Began. &#8220;Senator John F. Kerry of Massachusetts &#8230; said he will cease his complaints once the shooting starts. &#8216;It&#8217;s what you owe the troops,&#8217; said a statement from Kerry, a Navy veteran of the Vietnam War. &#8216;I remember being one of those guys and reading news reports from home.

Despite pledging two weeks ago to cool his criticism of the administration once war began, Kerry unleashed a barrage of criticism as US troops fought within 25 miles of Baghdad.&#8221; (Glen Johnson, &#8220;Kerry Says Us Needs Its Own &#8216;Regime Change,&#8217;&#8221; The Boston Globe, 4/3/03)\n \n \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Round 7: Flip-Flopped On Death Penalty For Terrorists\n \n \n \n In 1996, Kerry Attacked Governor Bill Weld For Supporting Death Penalty For Terrorists. KERRY: &#8220;Your policy would amount to a terrorist protection policy. Mine would put them in jail.&#8221; (1996 Massachusetts Senate Debate, 9/16/96)\n \n \n \n In 1996, Kerry Said, &#8220;You Can Change Your Mind On Things, But Not On Life-And-Death Issues.&#8221; (Timothy J.

KERRY: &#8220;The law of the land is the law of the land, but I have also said that I am for the death penalty for terrorists because terrorists have declared war on your country.&#8221; (NBC&#8217;s &#8220;Meet The Press,&#8221; 12/1/02)\n \n \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Round 8: Flip-Flopped On No Child Left Behind\n \n \n \n Kerry Voted For No Child Left Behind Act.

And it is divisive because it creates a &#8216;perception and a reality of reverse discrimination that has actually engendered racism.&#8217;&#8221; (Lynne Duke, &#8220;Senators Seek Serious Dialogue On Race,&#8221; The Washington Post, 4/8/92)\n \n \n \n In 2004, Kerry Denied Ever Having Called Affirmative Action &#8220;Divisive.&#8221; CNN&#8217;s KELLY WALLACE: &#8220;We caught up with the Senator, who said he never called affirmative action divisive, and accused Clark of playing politics.&#8221; SEN. KERRY: &#8220;That&#8217;s not what I said. I said there are people who believe that. And I said mend it, don&#8217;t end it. He&#8217;s trying to change what I said, but you can go read the quote. I said very clearly I have always voted for it. I&#8217;ve always supported it. I&#8217;ve never, ever condemned it. I did what Jim Clyburn did and what Bill Clinton did, which is mend it. And Jim Clyburn wouldn&#8217;t be supporting it if it were otherwise. So let&#8217;s not have any politics here.
