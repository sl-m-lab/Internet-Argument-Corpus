   "I want your opinion on these two choirs. I am currently in one of them, these were them last year. They have been bitter rivals for many years if not decades. I won't say who won, which choir I'm in, or what my opinion is quite yet. I want to know your opinion first. Both are considered of the best in the nation.\n \n (I only took one song from each's set. They're only about 3 minutes long).\n \n So, Choir 1:\n \n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znWl73Ha6cE&feature=related\n \n Or choir 2:\n \n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vi_86MVCDzw\n \n Sorry for bad audio quality.",

   "Er. My problem is that neither group is what I would call a choir. Choirs, to my mind, don't involve costumes and dancing; they just sing. \n \n So, I'll put aside my personal defininitions and just tell you which one I found most entertaining, for what that's worth. I'd go with Burbank. They had good choreography, relied on the group singing more than soloists (which I like), and packed more into their three minutes than the other group did.",

The proper term is show choir. That's one vote for Burbank high.\n \n Note: I wouldn't judge on what they didn't do in that three minutes. This is just one song in their 4 or 5 song set, and they do plenty of choreography, group singing, and soloists throughout their set. I'm more asking on what you saw there, who had the better musical sound and choreography?\n \n Better examples (more choreography than others):\n \n Burroughs: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5dVF7XmXGM\n \n Burbank: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKzYzXPgVZQ",
