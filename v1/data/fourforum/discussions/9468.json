   "First of all, every theory in science is methodologically atheistic, but no theory can ever falsify the existence of God. If you are talking about a specific theory concerning evolution, I would answer with the above sentence. But, if you ask whether evolution itself is atheistic, the question is ambiguous. Atheism, like religious faith, is about someone's beliefs about the world - not about how the world is. But semantics aside, any theory about evolution can only rule out things that can be falsified, and the existence of God is beyond falsification, so my answer would be that any theory, even M + NS, is methodologically, but not philosophically, atheistic. \n \n Now, if you are asking whether the process of evolution itself happens without God, or counts as evidence against the existence of God, I would have to say that the answer is unknown and unknowable. There is no way of knowing whether God helps to sort the genes in a population, or whether a Designer makes certain mutations happen in a non-random manner, or whether there is a God of the gaps who has created new forms in a sequential manner at the right time in geological history using previous forms as models or templates. \n \n I can, with certainty, say that what we know about evolution does falsify the Genesis account of creation and the flood story because there never was a world wide flood, the sequences described in Genesis contradict those found in the fossil record (such as the creation of flowering plants before fish), and it took longer than 6 days for all this to occur. So eveolution is inconsistent with certain beliefs about God even though it is not inconsistent with the existence of God. Well, that's my answer...",

I just told you that since Darwin's \"Natural Selection\" made no provision at all for \"origins\", he did not use the \"spontaneous generation\" fallacy to account for them. When his contemporaries pointed out this lacune, Darwin poached Lamarck, ( with what he called \"pangenesis\") in order to correct it. So yes, perhaps with pangenesis he came to a better, (but still weak), understanding of evolution, but \"natural selection\" added nothing to it of any value. And it's still a vacuous, inane, metaphysical trope, or trivial truism, falsely parading itself as a scientific mechanism, even as we speak.\n \n But at least it never was illogical enough to appeal to spontaneos generation. In fact Mendelian geneticism was resisted tooth and nail by the neo-darwinsts between 1900 and 1930, simply because geneticism implied that genes did it all, and NS was unnecessary to an understanding of biological evolution. I bet you didn't know that, did you? It wasn't until the statisticians, Wright, Haldane, and above all, Fisher, came up with their 'creatio ex nihilo', 'spontaneous generation', \"Random but still fortuitously and coincidentally adaptive, accidental genetic mutation\" metaphysical notion, in the face of all reason and rationality, that Mendelian genetics and its contradiction of Darwin's \"Natural Selection\" were speciously rationalised away, and the \"Modern Synthesis\" was born. Without that 'spontaneous generation' rationalization \"Natural Selection\" was dead in the water. So today it too depends for its persistance upon the fallacy of 'creatio ex nihilo'.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n We all know that \"Natural Selection\" has nothing to do with \"spontaneous generation\", simply because it has nothing whatsoever to do with 'generation' , i.e., 'origins', of any kind in any way.

If you want to appear intelligent, you'd better get an understanding of the meaning of 'random mutation', 'creatio ex nihilo', and spontaneous generation', none of which you presently possess, apparently.\n \n And just to head you off at any rationalization, pretending that genetic mutations are not 'spontaneously generated', simply because the proximate cause of them is entropically mechanical, gets you nowhere wrt the issue , i.e, _adaptive_, because it is the adaptive quality of the mutations you use to 'explain' evolution that, according to you, is 'spontaneously generated', 'creatio ex nihilo', out of the entropic action of bits of moving stuff, spontaneos stuff moving spontaneously as a result of spontaneously generated physical forces in a spontaneously generated universe,-- if we take your stance to its logical conclusion.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n What I did say and do say is that _your explanation_ for the fact of 'origins', (i.e., the fact that the universe had a beginning, and the fact that life on this planet had a beginning, and the fact that the life forms that are (and were) on this planet, each and all of them, had beginnings), is entirely based upon a commonly shared logical fallacy--'creatio ex nihilo', aka, 'spontaneous generation'.

Spontaneous and unassisted, with nothing in their metaphysic to account for it. In fact, according to materialism, \"emergence\" shouldn't exist, because according to them, the properties of a system should never be more in number than the sum total of the properties of all the physical parts of which it is composed. Yet we know that all systems do exactly that, even at the molecular level. By 'spntaneous generation, 'creatio ex nihilo'.

   "**\n Duh?!? I just told you that since Darwin's \"Natural Selection\" made no provision at all for \"origins\", he did not use the \"spontaneous generation\" fallacy to account for them.\n\n \"Spontaneous generation\" has been disproved, but saying that random mutations are the same thing is most certainly an equivocation.\n I'll spell it out for you, starting with an explanation of the classical \"spontaneous generation\" (from wikipedia):\"Classical notions of abiogenesis, now more precisely known as spontaneous generation, held that complex, living organisms are generated by decaying organic substances, e.g. that mice spontaneously appear in stored grain or maggots spontaneously appear in meat.\"Next, an explanation of mutations:Genetics. A change of the DNA sequence within a gene or chromosome of an organism resulting in the creation of a new character or trait not found in the parental type.If you want to call random mutations \"spontaneous generation,\" that is fine, but you cannot logically equivocate this with the outdated model of regular abiogenesis.\n \nWhen his contemporaries pointed out this lacune, Darwin poached Lamarck, ( with what he called \"pangenesis\") in order to correct it. So yes, perhaps with pangenesis he came to a better, (but still weak), understanding of evolution, but \"natural selection\" added nothing to it of any value. And it's still a vacuous, inane, metaphysical trope, or trivial truism, falsely parading itself as a scientific mechanism, even as we speak.\n\n Darwin came to an understanding of evolution that, along with his large array of evidence, convinced most of the scientific community that evolution occurred by natural selection. Also note that one of Darwin's contemporaries arrived at the same conclusion independently.\n Pangenesis, on the other hand, was not nearly so well received as it had some major problems and did not (unlike the ToE) stand up to observation nearly as well.\n \nBut at least it never was illogical enough to appeal to spontaneos generation. In fact Mendelian geneticism was resisted tooth and nail by the neo-darwinsts between 1900 and 1930, simply because geneticism implied that genes did it all, and NS was unnecessary to an understanding of biological evolution. I bet you didn't know that, did you?\n\n I have heard of it vaguely, and I would appreciate it if you did not make statements that resemble ad hominem so closely.\n \nIt wasn't until the statisticians, Wright, Haldane, and above all, Fisher, came up with their 'creatio ex nihilo', 'spontaneous generation', \"Random but still fortuitously and coincidentally adaptive, accidental genetic mutation\" metaphysical notion, in the face of all reason and rationality, that Mendelian genetics and its contradiction of Darwin's \"Natural Selection\" were speciously rationalised away, and the \"Modern Synthesis\" was born. Without that 'spontaneous generation' rationalization \"Natural Selection\" was dead in the water. So today it too depends for its persistance upon the fallacy of 'creatio ex nihilo'.\n\n And it appears that your argument is completely reliant on the fallacy of equivocation as explained above.\n \n**\n Since I define 'adapted' as the state or condition wherein organisms survive, thrive, and reproduce effectively and satisfactorily in their own terms, the answer is no. But the question is a rhetorical question, founded upon a fatuous tautology. Your 'point' is vacant.\n...because the best \"adapted\" organisms are defined as the ones that survive.I assume that I have interpreted your point correctly.\n \n Here we go: organisms that are better adapted are distinguishable from worse adapted ones even before you compare the number of survivors. Better adapted organisms will have a characteristic (more efficient movement, metabolism, reproduction, etc.) that distinguishes them from other organisms. Such organisms can be expected to reproduce at least slightly more than others with less advantageous characteristics. With a higher reproductive rate, the organisms and their descendants can reliably be expected to take up a larger percentage of the population as time goes on.\n For more information, visit this page.\n \nAnd just to head you off at any rationalization, pretending that genetic mutations are not 'spontaneously generated', simply because the proximate cause of them is entropically mechanical, gets you nowhere wrt the issue , i.e, _adaptive_, because it is the adaptive quality of the mutations you use to 'explain' evolution that, according to you, is 'spontaneously generated', 'creatio ex nihilo', out of the entropic action of bits of moving stuff, spontaneos stuff moving spontaneously as a result of spontaneously generated physical forces in a spontaneously generated universe,-- if we take your stance to its logical conclusion.\n\n So you are saying that random mutations cannot produce beneficial traits?\n Or are you saying that they will not reliably produce them when a population is experiencing selective pressure?\n \n Also, are you ignoring the reproductive rates of insects and bacteria (which are certainly fast enough to produce a large number of mutations)?\n \n**\n Now I'm starting to think that my offensive rhetorical question should apply to you as neatly as it applies to O.C.!!\n Of course, as I clearly explained, I do not think that your abiogenesis is part of your RMNS, although they are both dependent upon a metaphysical belief in the magic of 'spontaneous generation', (sometimes referred to by materialists as 'bottom-up _emergence_').\n\n So why do you think that spontaneous generation is required once life is present?\n \nSpontaneous and unassisted, with nothing in their metaphysic to account for it. In fact, according to materialism, \"emergence\" shouldn't exist, because according to them, the properties of a system should never be more in number than the sum total of the properties of all the physical parts of which it is composed.\n\n Reference?\n \nYet we know that all systems do exactly that, even at the molecular level. By 'spntaneous generation, 'creatio ex nihilo'. Call it emergence, but it's still the same old appeal to good old fashioned magic.\n\n Somehow, I don't think \"magic\" (or vitality, which is similar) is required for mutations to happen or for some of those mutations to improve an organism's chances of survival.\n \n**\n Calling a reasoned position a 'strawman' isn't going to save you. You have to show that it is not valid by means of a logical rebuttal. I'm betting none of you are capable of logical rebuttals, let alone a logical rebuttal to this particular argument of mine.\n\n Insisting that our arguments are based on \"spontaneous generation\" and equivocating that with the refuted hypothesis of spontaneous generation is a straw man. Pick one and stick with it.",

I never said any such thing, and you cannot quote me to that effect. Your, and O.C.'s, attempt to do so, above, simply does not demonstrate that I did any such thing. A common root for two notions does not imply, let alone assert, a necessary dependence of the one notion upon the other. I knew that O.C. would find that logic beyond his intellectual scope, but I thought that you were just glossing over it dishonestly. Apparently I was wrong about you. You are on the same plane intellectually as poor O.C.. But he has an excuse, being a juvenile. You don't.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n Like the lie in your last post in which you claim that I referred to \"Natural Selection\", when you knew perfectly well, as seen above, that by \"darwinsm\" I was referring to your \"Modern Synthesis\". \n \n I put \"by natural selection\" in parentheses to distinguish \"evolution\" as I was using it from your EAM \"evolution\" concept.

It's the _adaptedness_ that 'pops out of nowhere', by 'spontaneous generation' in your entropic molecular system failure. Believe it or not it is illogical and irration to believe that an entopic system failure can generate, from that failed (non-functioning) system, a novel and functioning system, 'creatio ex nihilo'. Accidentally breaking a unicycle cannot generate a bicycle, and accidentally breaking a bicycle cannot generate a unicycle, either. Nor will breaking a motorcycle generate a bicycle. Examples are endless and cogent.\n \n \n Merely re-arranging parts accidentally and purposelessly can never account for the productive 'something' that exceeds the sum of the physical properties of each and all mechanical parts in any complex system. Something else has to be input, each and every time. By something. Nothing 'emerges' out of nothing. 'Adaptedness' is a property, a quality, that cannot be generated, 'de novo', 'creatio ex nihilo', by an entropic, productivity-reducing, accidental system failure. Which is exactly why organismic autopoietic systems have devised dynamic abilities to remove the effects of entropic system failure (aka, accidental genetic mutations), as best they can, as soon as they can.\n \n But of course you'll just dismiss all this, since in your metaphysic, little 'bits of stuff' zipping about purposelessly, banging into one another, sometimes sticking to one another, can 'explain' absolutely everything and anything.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n It wasn't until the statisticians, Wright, Haldane, and above all, Fisher, came up with their 'creatio ex nihilo', 'spontaneous generation', \"Random but still fortuitously and coincidentally adaptive, accidental genetic mutation\" metaphysical notion, in the face of all reason and rationality, that Mendelian genetics and its contradiction of Darwin's \"Natural Selection\" were speciously rationalised away, and the \"Modern Synthesis\" was born. \n \n Abiogenesis is not part of the Modern Synthesis.

Your repetition of the same fatuous inanity, (as always, phrased as evasive rhetorical questions instead of honest declarations of opinion), is nothing but a repetition of the objection I demolished in the very post you are quoting.\n \n And here's another flash, socrates. The fact that some organisms die, for any number of reasons, sooner than some of their relatives do, explains exactly nothing. The insinuation that this survival differential has some universal, as opposed to local, efficient cause, is pure fecal matter. And that's all you've got, wiseguy. A simple fact of life, and an insinuated cause, and you think they add up to evolution. Breathtakingly simple-minded assumption, fella.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n I'll help you out here.

We don't. Mutations' effects are random. Selection sorts the effects. I don't think that I can make this any clearer.\n\n \n **\n You cannot make it clearer. None of you can. Nor can any of you make it truer. Or less false. Your problem is, nether you nor any of your fellow true-believers turn this inane vacuity into a scientific principle, since in fact there is no 'mechanical/physical' \"sorting\" involved in the rise and fall of natural organismic population statistics, anywhere. \n Mechanical/physical sorting requires a a fixed, mechanical/physical criterion, (like the size of the holes in a net). Not only does your \"Natural Selection\" not have that, it has nothing non-mechanical/physical to substitute for that essential requirement. That is, it does not have a criterion for selection, either, since all selection is values-based. And that entails teleological, intentional behaviour.\n \n In sum, your \"NS\" _has_ nothing because it _is_ nothing. Nothing but a metaphysical fantasm, one that's already just as clear as a soothsayer's crystal ball, and just as phony. \n \n __________________",

We're generally talking about a working system that gets altered in some way.\n Second, every biological process is entropic. Growing from a newborn to an adult -- which includes generation of new cells (what you might foolishly call \"spontaneous generation\") is nothing but internal entropic processes. If you had any understanding of biochemistry or thermodynamics, you'd know this. However, as you have established that you have an understanding of neither, we are not surprised at your error.\n Third, no, it's not illogical, and your belligerently claiming so does not make it so. If you want to maintain your ignorance of proof otherwise, don't follow this link to one paper (of many many many) on the effect of random mutations.\n \n \nAccidentally breaking a unicycle cannot generate a bicycle, and accidentally breaking a bicycle cannot generate a unicycle, either.\n\n We're not talking about breaking anything. Here's a better analogy, which you'd understand if you had any understanding of biology: building a bicycle in a slightly different way, and then later in a slightly different way, and later in a slightly different way can very well produce a significantly better bicycle. Rinse and repeat, and you've got a pretty damn kickass bike. Repeat for, oh, three billion years. Think we're stuck with dinky bicycles?\n \n \nMerely re-arranging parts accidentally and purposelessly can never account for the productive 'something' that exceeds the sum of the physical properties of each and all mechanical parts in any complex system.\n\n Unsupported assertion.\n \n \n'Adaptedness' is a property, a quality, that cannot be generated, 'de novo', 'creatio ex nihilo', by an entropic, productivity-reducing, accidental system failure.\n\n Outright countered assertion. See above.\n \n \nThere is no hope that you'll ever notice that the word, \"abiogenesis\" is neither used nor implied in the above statement, is there?\n\n Covered above. The problem is your ignorance of both the history of science and scientific terminology, which tends to be a common theme among evolution-deniers.\n \n \nThe fact that some organisms die, for any number of reasons, sooner than some of their relatives do, explains exactly nothing.\n\n So dead organisms have as good a chance of passing on their genes as do live ones? What do you not understand here?\n \n \nThe insinuation that this survival differential has some universal, as opposed to local, efficient cause, is pure fecal matter.\n\n Again, I can't explain this any better. How you think that genes from dead organisms can be as common as genes continually being replicated is beyond me.\n \n \nSounds like the the three year-olds retort, \"No, you are.\"\n\n Of course it sounds that simple when the error is that simple. But I was right. You're using \"spontaneous generation\" in a non-scientific sense in a very scientific discussion. Worse, you're using it to mean a multitude of things.\n \n \nYou cannot make it clearer.\n\n Damn right. Ninth- and tenth-grade students grasp this without a problem. As pandion and I explained in another thread, natural selection is an obvious effect of the biological world; one needs only understand that reproduction happens and that some organisms are better at it than others. That you are blind to this due in part to your inexplicable appeals to violations of unknown universal laws (conservation of adaptedness) is not something any of us will change.",

That is not 'creatio ex nihilo', anymore than the shards of broken glass on the sidewalk were generated 'spontaneously', 'creatio ex nihilo', by a clumsy drunk. What you keep failing to grasp is that the objection, 'creatio ex nihilo/spontaneous generation does not apply to such entropi, destructive eventd. What it does apply to are the mutations tied to negentropy, if you will. That is, those mutations which add a quality that was not there before, namely a productive increase in adaptedness. Entropic accidents, 'random mutations' cannot confer that new or increased quality of adaptive function, since the original form never had it, and the present form cannot it through entropic action, which works to decrease function in complex systems. \n \n Therefore any negentropic mutation, one that has generated novel or increased functionality/adaptedness in the organism, has, wrt your philosophy, no rational explanation for how it came into being.That because the disorder of entropic action cannot, by definition generate novel or increased order, the novel or increased order necessary to a complex system's functioning, as in 'adaptedness'. \n \n The best you can say is, \"It 'just happened', somehow.\" And that's an appeal to 'creatio ex nihilo'/'spontaneous generation'. Ridiculous. EAM says that that which increases functional adaptedness in complex biosystems is not entropy, but a form of negentropy or entelechy called Vitality, a natural force that purposefully drives such dynamic, self-generated, self-contolled, self-organizing, self-correcting and self-improving behaviours in living organisms.\n \n I sure hope a few lurkers are catching on to this, since there is little hope that you and your pals ever will.\n \n \n\n If you want to talk about the arising of modern life from protobiotic systems, that is not \"spontaneous generation.\" Much in the same way that biologists do not mean \"industrial change over time\" when they use the word \"evolution\" (much to the chagrin of marc9000),\n\n \n **\n No idea what you're trying to say.\n \n \n\n no respectable scientist reads \"spontaneous generation\" as \"any particular thing existing precisely where it didn't specifically exist before.\"\n\n \n **\n Nor should they, if they they can demonstrate how and why what happened, happened, or if, not knowing, they are still looking for a legitimate causal mechanism.

Dream on, bud.\n\n The words don't really matter as long as they are not used for the purposes of equivocation. If you want to use your definition of spontaneous generation, that's ok, but that also makes spontaneous generation a fact as opposed to a discredited hypothesis.\n \n**\n Actually it's the idea that something can come from nothing. Even your old friend, Lucretius, pooh-poohed that notion. In biology, the variation, i.e., that life can arise out of non-life, was pooh-poohed by several people from the 17th century on, most recently perhaps by Louis Pasteur in the 19th century.\n\n Definition of abiogenesis:The supposed development of living organisms from nonliving matter. Also called autogenesis, spontaneous generation.If you type \"spontaneous generation\" into Answers.com's search field, you will find that there is no entry for that phrase and that it comes up with abiogenesis instead. Apparently your definition isn't actually accurate...\n \nDon't try to teach this old hound to suck eggs, jack.\n\n You aren't even trying to avoid ad hominem.\n \n**\n It is if you can't demonstrates how they got there. But as I keep pointing out, the 'spontaneous generation'/'creatio ex nihilo' about the random mutations happen. They happen through entropic action. That is not 'creatio ex nihilo', anymore than the shards of broken glass on the sidewalk were generated 'spontaneously', 'creatio ex nihilo', by a clumsy drunk. What you keep failing to grasp is that the objection, 'creatio ex nihilo/spontaneous generation does not apply to such entropi, destructive eventd. What it does apply to are the mutations tied to negentropy, if you will. That is, those mutations which add a quality that was not there before, namely a productive increase in adaptedness. Entropic accidents, 'random mutations' cannot confer that new or increased quality of adaptive function, since the original form never had it, and the present form cannot it through entropic action, which works to decrease function in complex systems.\n\n However, that assertion is not supported by experiment (in fact, randomly changing certain variables in computer programming often ends up fixing a problem). It is also not supported by the second law of thermodynamics.\n \nTherefore any negentropic mutation, one that has generated novel or increased functionality/adaptedness in the organism, has, wrt your philosophy, no rational explanation for how it came into being.That because the disorder of entropic action cannot, by definition generate novel or increased order, the novel or increased order necessary to a complex system's functioning, as in 'adaptedness'.\n\n And the \"entropic\" action that produces snowflakes and wave clouds?\n \nThe best you can say is, \"It 'just happened', somehow.\"\n\n Through beneficial and detrimental mutations which were \"selected\" for and against, respectively.\n \nAnd that's an appeal to 'creatio ex nihilo'/'spontaneous generation'. Ridiculous. EAM says that that which increases functional adaptedness in complex biosystems is not entropy, but a form of negentropy or entelechy called Vitality, a natural force that purposefully drives such dynamic, self-generated, self-contolled, self-organizing, self-correcting and self-improving behaviours in living organisms.\n\n And why should \"vitality\" be any more exempt from your definition of \"entropy\" than the four basic forces?\n \nI sure hope a few lurkers are catching on to this, since there is little hope that you and your pals ever will.\n\n Actually, I would like anyone following this to weigh in and say who has the more convincing arguments (as debaters are never unbiased judges).\n \n**\n Nor should they, if they they can demonstrate how and why what happened, happened, or if, not knowing, they are still looking for a legitimate causal mechanism. Sadly that is not the case with a lot of people who call themselves 'scientists' when it comes to the issue of biological evolution. The real scientists...\n\n Don't give us the \"no true Scotsman\" argument.\n \n...recognise that \"RMNS\" is illegitimate, and are now concentrating on neo-lamarckian, devo-evo, self-directed mechanisms. Only those 'scientists' who are unworthy of respect still promote RMNS because it is a fundamental support to their materialist, atheist worldview.\n\n And the theistic evolutionists who promote mutations+selection?\n \n**\n We are talking 'generation', not 'conservation' here. A distinction you genetic inheritance RMNS types never seem able to grasp.\n\n You said:\n \nIt's the _adaptedness_ that 'pops out of nowhere' by 'spontaneous generation' in your entropic molecular system failure.\n\n A few points:[*]It does not \"pop out of nowhere,\" and don't try to indicate that we have argued for that position. Nucleotides are abundant within a cell, and it is not hard to assume that a thymine molecule could be present instead of a cytosine one. Mutations occur because the wrong nucleotide was added, and they do not \"pop out of nowhere.\"[*]Random mutations can produce adaptedness. This is especially true if the mutation is not initially very harmful, as it then remains in the population for a long time. Such a mutation can become helpful later on (sickle-cell anemia, for example), and it would then be considered adaptive.\n**\n You can alter a working, functional complex system in one of two different ways. First, you can alter it entropically, by accident, and decrease/eliminate its ability to function, to act productively- (i.e., you can break or damage it). This is the way of entropic system failure in the genome, aka, random genetic mutation.\n\n Except that random mutations can and do come up with beneficial traits. This may seem unlikely until you consider the number of potential beneficial traits. That number is much higher than 1, even though you appear to think that the the mutation+selection model requires a certain mutation to occur after it becomes necessary.\n \nSecond, you can alter it intentionally, with a teleological view towards improving or restoring function, that is a value-directed intentional activity based upon a desired end. This is what happens in the generation of adaptive mutations in organismic complex systems.\n\n So you are saying that there is an unseen force that has intelligence and decides where to put certain nucleotides?\n \n**\n Wow, thick or what. The issue is not that processes complex biosystems generate entropy as their effect, of course they do. The issue is that entropic processes do not generate novelty and increased adaptedness/productivity in biosystems. Of course they don't, but some are so blinded by their ideology that they can neither see nor accept that fact. You'd be one of those, lyte.\n\n And what is so special about organisms that simple processes cannot generate \"complexity\" in them but can generate it in snowflakes?\n \n**\n Having established that you know nothing of non-thermodynamic, information-based entropy in self-directed auropoietic systems, and that in fact that you cannot pull your head out of a primitive worldview that reduces everything, including complex biosystems, organisms, to the movements of their molecules in some chemical fashion, (as per your sig), it should come as no surprise to anyone to find that you have no understanding of biology whatsoever. It certainly does not surprise me.\n\n How about that? You provided no argument, no evidence, and simply dismissed materialism as incorrect because you think it is.\n \n**\n Neither does your belligerently claiming the opposite make that so.

A more difficult one for you to explain away would be radioactive decay.\n. \n \n **\n Any kind of decay is an entropic process. Whether it takes place in a thermodynamic system, or in information-driven self-organising open systems like the genome, the cell, the organ, or the whole organism. Your problem, as has been pointed out to you several times, is that you can't get past you insistence that the thermodynamic entropy of closed mechanical systems is the only legitimate usage for that word that there is. I don't like the equivocation either, but you can blame your boy Von Neumann for that, not me. He should have let Shannon come up with a better term.\n \n Since you are carefully 'quote-mining', leaving me to figure out the context from which you cherry pick the statements of mine that you quote, and since I don't feel that I should have to aid and abet this dishonest tactic of yours, I cannot comment on your response to my \"It is if you can't demonstrate how they got there.\" But I will tell you for the umpteenth time that simply describing a final effect or an observed process eg., \"DNA polymerase grabs the \"wrong\" nucleotide and sticks it in place.\", in no way shape or form can be said to 'explain' it. But as always, that's just too complex a thought for your powers of understanding.\n \n More importantly, destructive entropic DNA changes require no explanation, since they result in nothing but a loss of meaning and a decrease in productivity. As you've had clearly explained to you, you have to find dome other explanation besides entropic system failures to account for the gain in productivity that comes with adaptive mutations, but you don't have one. So you just stubbornly repeat that negentropic gain in a genone (an adaptive mutation),as expressed in an organismic systems adative productivity (adaptedness) is caused by an entropic event, i.e., entropy, just like all the accidental, disfunctional, and destructive DNA changes (genetic mutations) that generate maladaptive productivity reduction in organismic biosystems. \n A contradiction in terms. But you guys will never succeed in understanding what that means, either.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n What it does apply to are the mutations tied to negentropy, if you will. That is, those mutations which add a quality that was not there before, namely a productive increase in adaptedness. \n \n Please introduce the calculations showing a decrease in entropy for a beneficial mutation. Go ahead.\n Because you know nothing of thermodynamics, we know you won't.\n\n \n **\n Because it has nothing to do with thermodynamics, and because you can't accept that fact, your request is denied. But here's a clue. Expressed traits are largely a factor of structured information transmission from ordered genetic code to intended organic structure. Disorder in the genetic code's DNA structure, i.e., entropic information loss, cannot lead to an information gain, i.e., meaningful order, in any organismic structure (trait, property, or quality) that results from that genetic disorder. Put to you in simplest terms, entropy cannot reduce itself, and information cannot be generated out of information loss, 'creatio ex nihilo', by 'spontaneous generation'. To quote the old time programmners, \"Garbage in=garbage out.\".\n \n Another completely clear and undeniable fact of reality that you will never be able to accept, let alone understand. \n \n [quote]\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n Entropic accidents, 'random mutations' cannot confer that new or increased quality of adaptive function, since the original form never had it, and the present form cannot it through entropic action, which works to decrease function in complex systems. \n \n \n \n\n I already told you. Every function in biology is entropic.\n Please describe the mechanism that prevents \"entropic\" events from increasing function.\n\n \n **\n And I told you told you that an increase in meaning, i.e., increase in significance, equals a decrease in semiotic structural disorder (i.e., 'semiotic', or as Klyce put it in the material I posted, 'cognitive', entropy). I grant that 'semiotic entropy', or in this particular frame of reference, 'biosemiotic entropy' , is my term. But call it informational entropy, cognitive entropy, or semiotic entropy, it all adds up to productivity loss in information systems. And that is what living systems are.\n \n So the increase in a meaningful, productive, adaptive, i.e., informed, trait is \n is the reverse of entropic, even though its creation and operation, its functioning, produces some entropy, even thermodynamic entropy, while diminishing semiotic entropy in the system.\n \n Entropy diminishes productivity in functions as a matter of course. Everybody but you knows that. What we are discussing here is the mechanism that temporarily overcomes entropy and increases the productivity of the adaptation function in biosystems. To everyone but you guys it is obvious that entropy is not the mechanism that overides entropy in order to acheive this. The mechanism I offer in explanation is the force of Vitality powering the biosystem's functions.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n That because the disorder of entropic action cannot, by definition generate novel or increased order, the novel or increased order necessary to a complex system's functioning, as in 'adaptedness'. \n \n \"By definition\"?

By that token, taken as you imply it should be understood, evolution should be impossible, and the universe was either either in existence prior to the Big Bang, or was in existence as some form of matterless energy. This latter is something I could go for, but I don't see materialists like you guys accepting a premise that points directly at an eternal source ofphysical creation.\n \n \n\n It is clear at this point that you should learn what scientists mean.

What I do know is that intelligent human beings deliberately overiding the endogenous self-organization and self-sustaining functions functions of an organism has nothing to do with natural evolution, and so is just another non sequitur, or perhaps red herring, in the context of this debate. \n \n \n\n Here is where -- by definition -- you are wrong.

Instead, your answer depends on the environment. If the mutation confers an advantage in the first population, you count it as negentropic; if it confers a disadvantage, you count it as entropic. What if the mutation in the first population is advantageous and the same mutation is disadvantageous in the second? Then you have the same mutation being both entropic and negentropic. This is absolutely, positively absurd.\n But wait! There's more! Suppose a mutation isn't expressed until a later stage in an organism's life cycle. That mutation -- by wabbit's definition -- must be either entropic or negentropic.. but he won't be able to tell.

What absurdity.\n \n \n... is caused by an entropic event, i.e., entropy, just like all the accidental, disfunctional, and destructive DNA changes (genetic mutations) that generate maladaptive productivity reduction in organismic biosystems.\n\n And here you admit that my previous post's assertion is correct: you credit entropy for placing a nucleotide in place unless it is newly advantageous, in which case you engage in special pleading and invoke vitality.\n \n \nBecause it has nothing to do with thermodynamics, and because you can't accept that fact, your request is denied. \n\n Then why don't you show the calculations for your statistical/logical system?\n \n \nPut to you in simplest terms, entropy cannot reduce itself, and information cannot be generated out of information loss, 'creatio ex nihilo', by 'spontaneous generation'.\n\n So, again, as I said in a previous post, you are claiming that your position has nothing to do with thermodynamics, but you are (fallaciously) basing your conclusions on the second law of thermodynamics. Funny.\n \n \n... it all adds up to productivity loss in information systems. And that is what living systems are.\n\n Oh good. The \"information\" series of canards. Spetner fan, by chance? Refutations of this balderdash are numerous and easy to find. Check talkorigins.\n Yes, wabbit, you just pulled a Dembski. That would make sane people disgusted with themselves.\n \n \nTo everyone but you guys it is obvious that entropy is not the mechanism that overides entropy in order to acheive this.\n\n To everyone but you, you are not using the word \"entropy\" in any meaningful way.\n \n \nMy point exactly. In and of itself, the conservatory genome cannot generate novelty.\n\n And your point is (still) flawed. Nothing says that a genome is conservatory. Nothing says that a genome is conservatory barring vitality. You're only using a profound misunderstanding of thermodynamics and evolution in a half-assed attempt to make some sort of argument.\n \n \nWhat in the world do you imagine that that has to do with conservation and generation of form, structure, order and design, as in biosytems?!?!\n\n In context, this was an explanation of the word \"conservation.\" I should have remembered that your third grade reading comprehension skills wouldn't pick up on this.\n \n \nIt has been clear for a long time that, if you represent typical scientists, then most scientists talk a lot of tommyrot.\n\n You are the only one who thinks that, and that's because you don't understand what scientists say. (You want to know why you don't understand? Because you rely on your LGD...)\n \n \nI have no idea whether, wrt the organism involved, that mutation is adaptive or maladaptive, whether it increases the organisms adaptedness to its environment, or not.\n\n Good to see you explicitly admit that whether a mutation is entropic or negentropic is dependent upon environment. I've posed another, clarified question for you above, in case you missed it.\n \n \nI say they are artificial, utterly irrelevent to discovering the mechanism for natural processes.\n\n The point wasn't on the natural processes, the point was on the effects. But as this point is covered in the example question above, I'll ignore this for now.\n \n \nAnd most important, however they turn out for the organism, that are still driven by the Vitality supplied intelligence and volition of the experimenters, not your thermdynanic entropy.\n\n Ah, then the \"Vitality\" drives the disadvantageous mutations, too...\n \n \nYour example defeats the argument that you think it supports. What a losing proposition that is!.\n\n That's funny; your explanation defeats the argument that you think it supports. See immediately above.\n \n \nI don't care if it's one bicycle or a billion. Your superstitious faith in the powers of \"The Magick of Great Big Numbers\" is pathetic. Without intelligent intention no bicycle is ever going to, 'just happen, that's all'.\n\n All rhetoric, no argument.\n \n \nThe fact that populations have genetic variation, and that that variation, over the passage of time fluctuates statistically in differential comparisons, is simply recognition of a simple fact. Attributing the causal agency for that fact to a literary trope called \"Natural Selection\", a thing that is nothing but a descriptive label for the fact observed, is a fatuous inanity.\n\n If it's nothing but \"vacuous verbiage\" (which you call it below), why can't you answer my questions about dead organisms' genes being passed on as often as those of live ones? You are doing precisely the same thing that some of us talked about in this thread: conflating cause and effect.\n \n \nQuote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit\n Such as?

   "No, we will insist that abiogenesis and evolution (by natural selection) are completely independent -- that is, that neither one relies upon the other.\n \n If abiogenesis were not responsible for the first life on Earth, why would this invalidate all of the Modern Synthesis? Answer: It wouldn't. You're still talking out of your XXX.\n\n \n I agree with wascallywabbit completely here regarding biogenesis and evolution. So let me ask you this question electrolyte, would evolution have ever taken place had biogenesis never occurred ?The answer to that is of course not because there would have been nothing to evolve from or into. And spontaneous generation is a perfect term for describing what evolutionists claim would have had to have taken place in order for biogenesis to have occurred. So although the two studies have been separated by science for convenience, one is dependent upon the other for its existence.",

   "He uses the term \"spontaneous generation\" to try to associate beneficial mutations with a debunked hypothesis that has nothing to do with mutations.\n\n Actually, he's only sort of trying to do that. What he means when he says \"spontaneous generation\" is what he sees in his Little Golden Dictionary's definitions for each constituent word: arising of entities without concerted cause.\n \n \nSimilarly, he uses the term \"entropy\" to mean a decrease in organization and tries to associate that with the definition of entropy that is related to the second law of thermodynamics.\n\n Actually, he's working really hard to disassociate the two... but then he applies the second law anyway.\n \n \nOddly, he doesn't seem to notice that there is no law, theory, or fact which states that organization must \"decrease\" (whatever that means in this case).\n\n Bingo.\n \n \nI think he is trying to present it and is getting annoyed that we haven't yet accepted his untestable hypotheses and assumptions.\n\n What's truly sad is that he acts exactly as we'd expect a creationist posing as a dissident \"evolutionist\" to act. He's using the same stupid second law argument (while trying to cover this fact). I can see someone hoping to have the cwazy evowutionists accept the argument from a \"fellow\" evowutionist to establish a foot in the door only to turn around and remove the sheep's clothing. I believe that he honestly thinks he's right about this, but someone so blatantly obtuse and ignorant of the facts always triggers the creationist alarm.",

   "I agree with wascallywabbit completely here regarding biogenesis and evolution.\n\n \"Biogenesis\"? Since you use this term (instead of abiogenesis) repeatedly, it is clearly not a typo and is therefore indicative that you probably aren't very familiar with this topic...\n \n \nSo let me ask you this question electrolyte, would evolution have ever taken place had biogenesis never occurred ?\n\n Not only have I answered this question, you quoted my answer.\n \n \nThe answer to that is of course not because there would have been nothing to evolve from or into.\n\n I suppose ignorance is bliss. You are ignoring the other proposed explanations for the first life on Earth, like panspermia and special creation. To accurately ask the question at hand, you ask whether evolution could happen if panspermia had been the source of life on Earth. Answer: Yes. Now ask with special creation: again, the answer is yes.\n \n \nAnd spontaneous generation is a perfect term for describing what evolutionists claim would have had to have taken place in order for biogenesis to have occurred. So although the two studies have been separated by science for convenience, one is dependent upon the other for its existence.\n\n Wrong. Spontaneous generation per se refers to organisms arising from nutrients. Abiogenesis refers to the extended process of chemical evolution and development of cyclical reactions that eventually produced what we today consider life. It likely took several hundred million years, whereas spontaneous generation allegedly took mere hours or days, depending on the organism.\n For evidence progressive development of life-like systems, one needs look no further than mitochondria or chloroplasts and their self-contained DNA.\n \n [voice=Apu]Thank you, come again![/voice]",

   "IF wascally actually had a argument, he'd respond to how his measurement and testing wasn't valid or even possible. Instead he's completely ignored just how faulty it is. \n \n His idea requires a complete understanding of genes, every interaction, every coding, every possibly combination and even then that's not a indictation of intelligence, as it could easily simply be a method for documentation of new stimuli. \n \n Without a basis for testing he has no argument. I suspect that is why he completely refuses to address the criticism.\n\n \n \n \n \n Walking-fish:\n Wascally Wabbit's neolamarckism is about as vague as Dembski's specified complexity. And his/her dismissal of neodarwinism is based on the same assumption that non-teleological mechanisms can never lead to anything. That's why I find it impossible to even address his/her vitalist ramblings about EAM. There's nothing tangible behind the extensive verbiage that he/she throws out.
