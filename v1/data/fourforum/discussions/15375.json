   "Richard Elliot Friedman: The Bible: As Relevant (and Misunderstood) as Ever\n \n Op-Ed by Richard Elliot Friedman and Shawna Dolansk for Huff Post\n \n \n More than 20 centuries after the Bible's production, people still bring it to bear on practically every important social and political issue in the Western world (and much of the Eastern world). In the 18th and 19th centuries, both proponents and opponents of African slavery quoted chapters and verses to support their positions. In the 20th and 21st centuries, all sides of every hot issue, from stem cell research to homosexual marriage, include Bible interpretation to back up their stance. How is it possible that those who are pro-choice and those who are anti-abortion can both point to the same text to support their arguments? How can some Jews and Christians use the Bible to justify the subordination of women while other Jews and Christians base feminist reforms and the emancipation -- and even ordination -- of women on the very same Scripture?\n Sometimes the Bible says what people think it does. Often it does not. Sometimes it presents multiple perspectives on the same issue. And on some issues it says nothing at all. The Bible is frequently mistranslated, misquoted and misunderstood. Why? For one thing, people usually read it in translations, and without knowledge of its original literary or historical context. And they rarely read it in its entirety, so they end up pulling out small pieces: quotations and passages that seem to say what they want them to. Sometimes they are well-meaning. Sometimes their motives are not so pure.\n But this does not mean that we can't use the Bible. It doesn't mean that we can't find what it has to say about the big issues. The Bible's value, above all, is as a guide to lives. And we mean to all of our lives, whether one is religious or not, whether one is Christian, Jewish, or from another religion or no religion. Some people think of fundamentalist Christians and Orthodox Jews as the ones who connect their decisions to the words of the Bible. But that is not correct. One finds scholars, clergy and just folks, from all across the religious spectrum, who read, study and care about what the Bible says on things that matter to them. And one finds many who have never read or studied the Bible who still share a cultural sense of its importance as a foundation for morality and virtue. \n \n The Bible is a source of human experience and of wisdom, and wisdom is something we need. We can argue about which biblical passages are historically accurate, but, still, it is the first history writing on earth.The Bible's oldest prose was written when Herodotus's great-grandmother was not yet in preschool. We can question the morality of any given story or law, but still the Bible is an extraordinary repository of remarkable stories, exquisite writing and revolutionary laws. Indeed, when we argue about these things, we are participating in a 2,000-year-old process that the Bible itself started us doing. You may say, \"But there have been times in history (and the present) when people used the Bible for harm: burning 'witches,' attacking 'infidels,' defending slavery.\" True, but that, precisely, proves that we cannot ignore it. The fact that it has both inspired people to do great good and been used by people to do great harm means that it is really important for us to pay attention to it -- and to get it right.So we wrote a book (\"The Bible Now,\" Oxford University Press, 2011) designed to help people understand the Bible's place on five major issues of our time: homosexuality, abortion, women, the death penalty and the earth.\n \n We use historical-critical methods, philological and literary analyses, text criticism, source criticism, redaction criticism, anthropological perspectives, archaeology and ancient languages (Hebrew, Greek, Akkadian, Ugaritic, Aramaic) -- the variety of tools of our trade -- to address these questions. We are not doing this out of some antiquarian curiosity with ancient things. As much as the Bible is an ancient artifact, it is also a present one. The Bible matters to people. Biblical scholars are thus in the position of treating a classical text with tools and skills like those of a scholar of Homer or Aristotle but at the same time dealing with immediate, relevant issues like those in each morning's news.\n \n We were both trained in critical biblical scholarship, but that does not mean that we cannot write for orthodox and fundamentalist readers with courtesy and respect. And as long as we keep to the facts and to honest method, what we have to share from our research should be useful to both traditional and critical, religious and not-religious, readers.\n \n We're using this post (and future posts) on HuffPost Religion to help us reach an audience that is engaged with these issues. We want you to see how the Bible actually treats them, so we'll be raising issues from our book here over the next several weeks. \n \n We also want to learn from you; to get your feedback on these and other issues. You may be surprised by what the Bible actually says -- or doesn't say. Our job is only to present the information, not to persuade you to be for or against abortion, for example. But whatever position you take on abortion, you should be better informed of the evidence. And you should be able to explain your position to yourself and others. And you should be able to defend your position in arguments better. You may change your mind. You may not. But our goal is to give you as much good information as possible. You can do with it what you will.\"\n \n Now say that!",

   "From what I've gathered over the years, being born again means turning away from your faith, maybe being an agnostic or something, and then realizing Christianity is actually the real way to go, and becoming \"born again\" in Christianity.\n \n That probably isn't it though, right?\n\n \n Being \"born again\" in the New Testament \n \n Being \"born again\" in the New Testament refers to something God does when we turn to him with repentance and faith. The expressions \"born again\", \"born of the Spirit\", or \"born of God\" are used about 15 times in the New Testament of becoming, or being, a Christian. It is one of John's favourite ways of describing a Christian, but Peter uses it twice and Paul once.* John tells us how a Jewish religious leader, Nicodemus, came to Jesus at night. He probably came at night because it would be unseemly for one in his position to be seen associating with Jesus, who was considered to be a stirrer by the authorities. In the discussion that followed, Jesus said to him, \"I tell you the truth, unless a man is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God\" (John 3:3). The Greek word translated \"born again\" could equally well be translated \"born from above\". What did he mean?\n \n *John 1:13; 3:3, 5,6,7,8. Galatians 4:29. 1 Peter 1:3, 23. 1 John 2:29; 3:9; 4:7; 5:1; 4, 18.\n \n \n \"It is not the turning over of a new leaf, but the receiving of a new life - not just a new start, but a new heart\"\n \n \n The Bible emphasizes two things that God will do for us when we submit our lives to Jesus. The first thing he will do is to forgive our wrongdoing. Paul is fond of using the word \"justify\", which is a legal term meaning that we are acquitted of all the charges against us - declared innocent. \"Since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ\" (Romans 5:1). Jesus paid for our sins on the cross and now credits to us his own perfect righteousness. \"God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God\" (2 Corinthians 5:21). A wonderful transaction!\n \n The second thing that God does is to come in the person of the Holy Spirit to literally live within us, his Spirit uniting with our human spirit. This experience of receiving the Holy Spirit is what Jesus is talking about when he says we are to be \"born again\". In fact he went on to call it being \"born of the Spirit\" (John 3:5,8). This experience is also spoken of as a resurrection, \"God...made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions\" (Ephesians 2:4); as receiving eternal life, \"God has given us eternal life\" (1 John 5:11); or as being recreated, \"if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation\" (2 Corinthians 5:17). Before we receive the Holy Spirit there is a gulf between us and God. We are \"dead in... transgressions and sins\" (Ephesians 2:1). After we receive him we are united with him in an intimate relationship. We are \"born\" into his family - we have spiritual life - a new relationship with God, who is now \"Father\", and a new relationship with other believers who are our \"brothers and sisters\". We also have a new spiritual home which is \"heaven\".\n \n It is interesting that, whereas John and Peter use the metaphor of being born into God's family for this experience of becoming a Christian, Paul prefers the idea of adoption. \"You received the Spirit of adoption. And by him we cry...Father\" (Romans 8:15 - literal translation). The first metaphor emphasizes our union with God, sharing his nature by his Spirit within us. The metaphor of adoption puts the emphasis on our legal standing, with all the rights and privileges we share as children of God.\n \n This experience of reconciliation with God and transformation, through spiritual birth, is made possible for us through the death and resurrection of Jesus. It was foretold 600 years before those events by the prophet Ezekiel, to whom God declared, \"I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean; I will cleanse you from all your impurities...I will give you a new heart...I will put my Spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees\" (Ezekiel 36:25-27). \n \n More in the following link:\n \n Born Again",

What makes you think a great many Christians didn't already study and reject other rationales before they came to Christ?\n\n \n Some have, but for the most part there is a purposeful effort to ignore anything that does not conform to their idea of what the religion is supposed to be. Do a search on God and Dinosaurs and see how many silly sources of \"the truth\" come up to explain how there is a disconnect in the Bible and dinosaurs. \n \n \nYou didn't answer the question. What makes you think a great many Christians didn't already study and reject other rationales before they came to Christ?\n\n \n Because it would lower the overall IQ of Christians and most of them are not dumb, they just find it necessary to not face questions that would jepordize their safety zone of what the religion is.\n \n \nAnd to answer you, first falsify the Resurrection. Then show me an alternative rationale that explains those events better according to your worldview. And make sure you provide some evidence to back up your theory.\n\n \n That is a great example. I can give you plenty of evidence that the resurrection di not happen. What I can't do is take you back in time and stand you in front of the tomb. \n \n You have to rely on faith that it did occur because you can not prove it by today's standards of evidence. I don't need faith to show that it didn't happen. You will require a degree of evidence greater than what you accept as proof it happened to show that it didn't. As I think about it there probably is nothing that would convince you that it didn't happen. This is why in so many instances Christianity loses credibility. Instead of saying \"We don't know\" they come up with at time ridiculous reasons to explain things. They then stand firm despite at times overwhelming evidence to the contrary. \n \n Supposedly God is this profound mystery that no man can truly fathom, but somehow Christians have done exactly that. The problem that I see is every 20th one has done so differently. Why are there so many different denominations? When the religion can agree on more than 5 basic concepts then come and tell me they have thought it all out.\n \n \nJesus is Risen!\n\n \n And then he left saying he would call, but never has.",

A being able to cease the degree of functional capacity that is recognized as necessary to be considered alive in a human and then raise it again is not dead. For them they have simply altered their state of existance. We are not God we do not have the ability to go between one state and the other. To have died it would be necessary for all aspects of the Trinity to die as well. If you cut a worm in thirds as long as one of the pieces is alive the other two can die and the one will regrow the other two as part of the whole which if your sadistic you can cut in thirds again.\n \n If Jesus was God in the flesh, then the death of his flesh is not the death of him, only his flesh which is necessary to enter Heaven according to Paul. So really Jesus had to discard the flesh whether he offered salvation or not if he wanted to go to Heaven. Since he remains living with at least two aspects alive and the death of his flesh something he had to do anyway why do you make such a big deal about it? Do you think he did not want to and would have preferred to stay earthbound? \n \n \nI rely on a number of historical accounts and the fact that science has never proven the supernatural cannot or does not occur. \n\n \n You rely on one historical account of questionable authenticity and science could prove the supernatural does or does not exist and would have no bearing on Christianity. \n \n In a nutshell you have faith that it is true, hence the reason faith is such a vital part of religion.

And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth. \n \n More of Gods creatures\n and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone. for their tails were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt. \n \n Heaven does not sound like a very enjoyable place.",

You presented a false dichotomy. There was a third option your brain wasn't up for yet until I enlightened you.\n\n \n No, you didn't at all. You are always the one spouting how you have given yourself over to Christ, and how everyone else should too. I imagine every Christian would say that they too, have given themselves over to him. The problem is that even the most devout Christians sin, too. The bible makes it very clear that even after giving yourself over to Christ, you have to work even harder to avoid sinning, which is why they repent and why they need guidance through the church and the bible. Surely you aren't suggesting that you are perfect?\n \n So obviously something has to change between earth and heaven when it comes down to 'free will,' because Christians on earth sin all the time. If you want to end the argument by saying that Christians give their permission to be pre-programmed, then that's fine, but something has to change in each Christian between earth and heaven, and if they no longer have the same thoughts, desires, or ability to make the choices that lead to sin on earth, then they aren't the same people that they were on earth (they're just robots), and if that's the case, then why didn't God just make everybody robots from the beginning and avoid all the suffering?\n \n If it was somehow possible to merge free will with no sin, then God is the one to blame for every sin ever done, since he could have started the world in a sinless state where everyone still had free will.\n \n Also, it was not a false dichotomy, and I didn't set it up. You set up the dichotomy yourself when you said this:\n \n \nGod allows mankind (for a time) to do good or evil. Free will.

According to your own words, the only alternative is being pre-programmed robots. \n \n If heaven is a place without evil, then that is no longer a choice, and free will doesn't exist. Therefore your alternative must be in place, meaning you must become a pre-programmed robot. Your own words allude to this when you say that God only allows man to do good or evil for a limited time.

   "Tsk tsk...\n \n I told you to study your Bible. You evidently didn't look very hard. Nor do you understand the holiness and power of the Holy Spirit, who will be given to believers (their free will choice) in full measure in heaven, giving them an understanding of the divine that precludes them doing evil.\n \n And I will put my Spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws. - Ezekiel 36:27\n\n \n Not talking about heaven. It's talking about the Israelites in the land of their fathers after the Messiah casts out the sinners... even so, that is a blatant destruction of free will. What you have is a bunch of robots who have been implanted with the 'spirit' to act how God wants them to act. Your definition of free will was the choice to do good or evil. By \"precluding evil\" (your words again) they have lost free will. I will take it that this is how you think it will happen in heaven.\n \n \nBut we know that when he appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. 1 John 3:2 NIV\n\n \n It denotes change, which you've said before and I've said before. The problem is that by changing you, you won't be the same person, and you won't have free will. \n \n \nAnd we, who with unveiled faces all reflect the Lord's glory, are being transformed into his likeness with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit. 2 Corinthians 3:18\n\n \n Again, changed. You are no longer the same person.\n \n \nThrough these he has given us his very great and precious promises, so that through them you may participate in the divine nature and escape the corruption in the world caused by evil desires. 2 Peter 1:4\n\n \n But why did God create the world as a corrupt place? It again implies that you lose your free will. If God just gets rid of the evil desires in heaven, why did he allow the evil desires to begin with?\n \n \n\"We shall all be changed...the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality...then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory\" (1 Cor. 15:51-54).\n\n \n Again, telling me something I already know. You are changed. I know that.\n \n \nIf you still don't get it then you are lost indeed and there is little hope for you.\n\n \n You seem to have decided on \"Christians will be changed and no longer have free will in heaven.\" You now say that it was their free will choice to accept Jesus as Christ and therefore it was their will to be changed and lose their free will. That's fine if you are okay with being a robot, but if it's okay to take away free will in heaven, what was the point of ever having free will at all? It did nothing but cause evil and suffering. Why not just create divine people from the beginning that avoided sin by default (like they will do in heaven)? Why did he make a bunch of corrupt people other than to watch them suffer? \n \n If I have misunderstood you and you still hold to Christians in heaven having free will, then you've gotten nowhere. You are right back to where you were 10+ posts ago when you originally quoted the 'incorruptible' verse. You still have to answer why God made earth corrupt to start with (Actually, you have to answer that either way). This route necessarily means that you have to stop blaming suffering on free will too (since free will is possible in heaven without sin... somehow).\n \n I appreciate the verses and the effort, but the verses didn't say anything more than I already knew (and you had already said that God would change man in your original reply 10+ posts ago). There was nothing about free will and nothing about why God made a corruptible earth/evil nature.",

   "If he did then they would have been pre-programmed robots. At least by living they could experience why evil is bad and the downside of living that kind of life.\n\n \n See, you are confusing me. Are you now admitting that you are pre-programmed robots when you get to heaven? You say here that God didn't give man the insight because it would have made him a pre-programmed robot, but he will give it to man in heaven, making him a robot for eternity. Prior experience on earth isn't going to change that once a person gets to heaven; they will still be robots (and I've even heard it said that you won't remember the evil and suffering from earth, or friends and family who didn't make it to heaven, since bad memories would bring about sadness). To say that man's experience of suffering is necessary to avoid being a robot is to say that God's insight isn't insightful enough to let man understand evil, and brings up questions about if God himself had to experience evil at some point. \n \n \nIt's one's free will choice. It's not a changing of one's will. There is no carnal nature in heaven.\n \n \n I'll accept that it's a free will choice to accept the insight (although I don't think that matters), but it certainly is a changing of the will (definition of will: The mental faculty by which one deliberately chooses or decides upon a course of action). It may be that you accept a change or loss of free will, but that doesn't change that the will is changed/lost.\n \n \nAgain, free will to do either good or evil. You have to know what evil is to have a perception of goodness. Then you become like God, knowing good and evil (note Genesis 3:22 in conjunction with Genesis 1:26).\n \n \n There is a fatal flaw in this theory that man needs to experience evil to avoid being a robot: What about the children? I read recently that over 50 billion humans have died while infants or young children. Either they are in hell (which is unfair by any stretch of the imagination), or you believe the doctrine of 'age of accountability' and that they are in heaven. But they never would have had the opportunity to actually know anything about right and wrong while on earth, and would have never experienced it (especially the ones who died within their first year of life or before they were born). That's 50 billion robots if they went to heaven (50 billion torture victims if not).\n \n And I don't buy the argument anyway. Why would you need to experience evil to do good? Why does evil need to exist at all if it doesn't exist in heaven? Is the insight of God not powerful enough to get someone to understand evil? Did God and Jesus (and the angels) need to experience evil before they became 'all good' (and did they all need a savior)? If we have the same kind of insight as them, then why would that (and the suffering that results) be necessary? It seems Satan was already around (apparently he didn't have the insight), so why couldn't man just view Satan's actions to know and see the effects of evil without having to suffer and die?\n \n The other problem is that earth isn't just used as an experience; it is a test of people lacking insight, which causes people (the majority of people) to wind up being tortured for eternity. The 'insight' could avoid all that.\n \n And the last problem is that mankind already knows good from evil... that's not the change that occurs. That was what happened when Adam and Eve ate from the tree and made God nervous (on a side note, why did he put the trees there if he didn't want them to eat it, and if they didn't know right from wrong before they ate from it, how were they to know it was wrong to disobey God and eat of the tree in the first place? And who let the snake in?). If we didn't know good from evil on earth, then it wouldn't make any sense at all to punish man for his actions (it would be like punishing a newborn). \n \n So good and evil were made known to man right at the tree... Were Adam and Eve just robots before they ate from the tree? No, they were just ignorant. They had obviously never experienced evil, yet they were still expected to obey... they were still expected to know not to disobey despite never having experienced evil or even knowing good from evil. The 'godly insight' would have let them know good and evil and not to do evil from the get go. Even parents can teach a child good from bad without the child ever experiencing the evil; and grown humans are far better at learning and understanding concepts than children.\n \n Anyway, sorry to be so long winded. I'm glad you gave actual answers to why there is a carnal nature, but I've pointed out the flaws in the argument (and I'm still not completely sure how you view free will in heaven. You say it's there, but then say things like you did in the first sentence of this post).",
