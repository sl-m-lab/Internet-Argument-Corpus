   "How much longer before public beheadings begin in Eurabia, Islamic style? This has been perfected in Saudi Arabia where the condemned is taken into the city square and public executioner takes his sword and seperates the head from the body. Coming to a city near you.\n ===============================\n \n FALLACI TO GO ON TRIAL FOR DEFAMING ISLAM\n \n (AGI) - L'Aquila, Italy, May 24 \n \n - In Oriana Fallaci's book \"The Force of Reason\" there are expressions that are \"unequivocally offensive to Islam and Muslims,\" said the Bergamo preliminary investigative judge, Armando Grasso, who accepting the Adel Smith's opposition to filing away the trial proposed by the prosecutor, ordered the prosecution to formulate the charge \"according to article 406 of article 403 of the criminal code,\" for defamation of Islam. The well known author, therefore, will be put on trial. Adel Smith, president of the Italian Muslim Union, sued the writer on April 8, 2004, after \"also in other writings Oriana Fallaci had propagated hate against Islam and Muslims, distorting real historical facts and inventing others, lying, offending, and defaming Muslims around the world. For the rest, ever since \"Anger and Pride\" the writer has injured Islam and Muslims, writing expressions such as '****ing sons of Allah',\" said Smith. The Bergamo Prosecution is taking on the trial, since the book was published in the city, and now has ten days to come up with a charge. The preliminary hearing judge will set the trial date. Matteo Nicoli of Verona will represent Adel Smith.\n \n http://www.agi.it/english/news.pl?doc=200505241320-1114-RT1-CRO-0-NF51&page=0&id=agionline-eng.arab",

Long as you phrase your critism of Islam right, then there is no problem, you can say that the Middle eastern theocracies are not doing enough to prevent terrorism or even encouraging it - you can't say that muslim means terrorist, or terrorist supporter especially as you think the only good one is a dead one.\n\n \n You and others keep repeating claims that I have never made.

I think Christianity has been every bit as bad and worse than any other large religious group you care to name.\n \n Have you ever read accounts of the battles of the Crusades? do you have the slighest inkling of the gross barbarity committed in the name of Christianity? (we would call it genocide today, Mule). Try reading up some history before yuo make yourself look so ignorant again. There are plenty of other examples as well, if the Medieval Middle East is not to your taste.\n\n \n I don't know about your percentages as you have just pulled that out of the air. In any event the numbers are substantial; even if only 2% are the terrorists. Do the math.\n \n As to Christianiaty and the Inquisition. I've studied history and know about that but Christianianty never posed a worldwide threat to humanity that Islam does. And anyone who compares the two is badly deceived. Europe will be the place where this will be seen quite clearly in the years to come as the native population is replaced by the Muslim hoards that are outbirthing and immigrating into Europe at a prodigious rate. \n \n But I want to stress.

   "There's quite a few reasons why that could be horribly skewed though\n \n It goes from EU to europe quite a bit and there is a very big difference, I'd expect Albanian birthrates to be significantly higher than those of France of Germany, and Eastern Europe I would imagine has a larger percentage of muslims than western (its closer to countries with higher muslim populations and a lot of the customs we associate with muslims here are actually just eastern european ones i.e head-scaves). However the christian birthrates in eastern european countries are probably higher than those in western europe as well.\n \n Muslims are going to comprise more of the immigrant population as well, seeing as they are not immediately going to switch to a western lifestyle overnight its going to push up them numbers there too.\n \n Of the people I know who are muslims here in the UK, none have particularly large families (i.e 2 or 3 kids) whilst none of them are recent immigrants to the UK and their families has been here for at lesat three generations this is really the point. Birthrate is closely linked to lifestyle - if you are a living in a western nation then you will probably have a western birthrate, if you have just come out of a poor culture then you will probably have a higher one.\n \n What will happen is that the muslim percentage of the population will increase and then level off, as the article says these muslims are from very different cultures so its a very different thing from the mexican/southern US situation where there is a growing majority of people all with the same language and culture. We won't lose english as a language (seeing as a lot would have to talk to each other in it anyway if they wanted to understand each other). Big difference between a few more mosques than Eurabia.",

   "There's quite a few reasons why that could be horribly skewed though\n \n It goes from EU to europe quite a bit and there is a very big difference, I'd expect Albanian birthrates to be significantly higher than those of France of Germany, and Eastern Europe I would imagine has a larger percentage of muslims than western (its closer to countries with higher muslim populations and a lot of the customs we associate with muslims here are actually just eastern european ones i.e head-scaves). However the christian birthrates in eastern european countries are probably higher than those in western europe as well.\n \n Muslims are going to comprise more of the immigrant population as well, seeing as they are not immediately going to switch to a western lifestyle overnight its going to push up them numbers there too.\n \n Of the people I know who are muslims here in the UK, none have particularly large families (i.e 2 or 3 kids) whilst none of them are recent immigrants to the UK and their families has been here for at lesat three generations this is really the point. Birthrate is closely linked to lifestyle - if you are a living in a western nation then you will probably have a western birthrate, if you have just come out of a poor culture then you will probably have a higher one.\n \n What will happen is that the muslim percentage of the population will increase and then level off, as the article says these muslims are from very different cultures so its a very different thing from the mexican/southern US situation where there is a growing majority of people all with the same language and culture. We won't lose english as a language (seeing as a lot would have to talk to each other in it anyway if they wanted to understand each other). Big difference between a few more mosques than Eurabia.\n\n \n If, and I emphaize IF, these immigrants assimilate into European culture you may very well be correct. But I don't see it happening. I hope for your sake you are right and I am wrong. But I'm not.",

   "More are on the way. Today, the Muslim birth rate in Europe is three times higher than the non-Muslim one. If current trends continue, the Muslim population of Europe will nearly double by 2015, while the non-Muslim population will shrink by 3.5 percent.\n \n http://www.brookings.edu/views/op-ed/fellows/taspinar20030301.htm\n\n \n The problem with Mr Taspinars figure is that he gives no inkling of how he came across them. I`ve looked rather carefully on the net for any indication that his figure might be correct, but I can`t find any study at all that supports the idea. The reason for this is that European countries don`t record etnicity, religion or race at birth. This is why I find it peculiar that Mr Taspinar somehow has knowledge of the exact birthrate of muslims in Europe (and as pointed out above, it doesn`t really help that he doesn`t give any refference to his claim)\n \n there are many reasons why the figure, assuming that the figures are based on something rather than Mr Taspinar just used some form of estimation (like using the birthrates for muslims in the US for example), could be terribly skewed. First of all, does he correct for age structure? Immigrants in general are overrepresented in the fertile ages which naturally leads to more births at the moment for this group. The fact that muslims are the newest immigrant group makes this effect even more important.\n \n Does he correct for changes between first and second generation muslim immigrants? First generation immigrants are less integrated than second generation immigrants. This has a significant impact on unemployment and income figures. It`s very plausible that it has a significant impact on birth rates as well. \n \n Does he correct for the fact that european mothers wait longer and longer before producing offsrping, and therfor there is a certain lag in the european birthrates showing lower statistical figures than we should expect?\n \n What is his control groups? Is it non-muslims on average thoughout europe? Is it average birthrates thoughout europe? Is Russia included? etc, etc.\n \n There are many problems with just throwing out a figure. At least if you are not the one who know where the figure actually comes from...\n \n \n I took a look at the availiable statistics on children in first generation immigrants in Sweden. Roughly 12% of the Swedish population was borned in another country. Roughly 12% of the children where born in families where both parents where considered first generation immigrants. In areas with high percentage of children in first generation immigrant families (ie; high concentration of first generation immigrants), the birth rates was actually lower than the average birth rate (about 1,85)... My conclusion of this is that if there is a significantly higher birth rate among muslims in Europe (which I doubt), it is concentrated to certain european countries (like albania or Turkey :p )",
