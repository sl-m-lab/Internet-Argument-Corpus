   "So much for the oft-heard dire predicition that legalizing consensual sodomy would \"inevitably\" lead to legalized polygamy... \nThe US Supreme Court Monday declined to consider the appeal by a Utah man with three wives who sought to overturn his bigamy conviction by citing the high court's 2003 landmark ruling on gay rights. \n \n The action lets stand a Utah Supreme Court decision upholding the state's bigamy law even though it clashes with some residents' sincerely held religious beliefs. \n \n \"There are literally thousands of religious people in Utah ... who now have to be concerned to look over their shoulder that some day [state Attorney General] Mark Shurtleff and the state of Utah will come after them,\" says Raymond Berry, one of the lawyers representing polygamist Rodney Holm. The ruling will raise concerns among religious fundamentalists in Utah that the state will step up its pressure against them, he adds. \"They are kind of like turtles, they pull their heads in, they stay out of the public eye.\"\n http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0227/p25s01-usju.html",

Like I pointed out, as long as ANOTHER legitimate state interest exists BESIDES arbitrary claims of \"morality\", the laws can still exist.\n Some of Scalia's list demonstrates his absurdly oppressive mind. \"masturbation\"? \"adultery\"? \"fornication\"? Quite frankly, our society shouldn't be regulating these issues in the first place. It's not the government's place to dictate policy on \"masturbation\". I am curious if ANY state has \"adultery\" or \"fornication\" (the act itself) as illegal.\n As for other issues, there are other legitimate state interests. Public health. Preventing cruelty to animals. etc, etc, etc...\n Just because arbitrary claims of \"morality\" are thrown out the window doesn't mean that the law goes along with it, unless that is the ONLY justification it has.\n \n \n \nAnd the fact that we can expect that the court will not follow its logic to the end proves the most important assertion that has been made in critique of Lawrence: we can expect the court to invalidate any law which it does not like. A principle such as that is not based on Constitutional theory; it is based on government by judiciary.\n\n Amazing how you rephrase what they ACTUALLY said into some absurd fantasy you have, and then justify your own delusions.\n No. They didn't invalidate sodomy laws just because they did not like. It borders on dishonesty to make such a claim, when their ruling can be read and \"did not like\" can nowhere be found.\n Can we please leave the strawman arguments out of this?\n \n The reason they will not follow SCALIA'S (and please be accurate in describing it as such) logic is because they did not rule on scalia's logic. There are other issues at work here.\n If you want a real discussion on this, then please discuss what they ACTUALLY are saying and the ACTUAL standards at work instead of Scalia's absurd combination of strawman and domino.\n Scalia INACCURATELY assesses what the court ACTUALLY said.\n I suggest you deal with what the court ACTUALLY said instead of relying on Scalia's inaccurate paraphrasal of it.\n \n \n \nPer my answer above, I would say this is correct so long as one wants to follow the court's reasoning to its logical conclusion, i.e., that moral decisions do not constitute a legitimate state interest.\n\n Do you realize that there are OTHER justifications for some laws BESIDES just arbitrary claims of \"morality\"?\n \n \n \nThere are numerous asserted state justifications.

Surely you are not suggesting that, since the only legitimate interest is \"incapability to procreate,\" and since this does not apply to polygamy, laws prohibiting polygamy are therefore unconstitutional on the basis that the only other justification is a moral one?\n\n If there are \"numerous asserted state justifications\", then I suggest you start citing precedent. \"incapability to procreate\" is the main one I have seen.\n If you want to talk about others, I suggest you bring them up.\n \n And second, the point I made was clear. The \"domino\" theory doesn't apply to legalized gay marriage CAUSING polygamy legalization.\n Legalizing gay marriage would have to include some element which would CAUSE polygamy to be legalized as well. When in truth, they are unrelated.\n The only thing they have in common is the word \"marriage\" in their title.\n \n By such limited logic, I could claim that the overturning of laws which prohibit blacks from riding at the front of the bus would mean that the bus must also allow naked people to ride. Such a \"domino\" theory would be absurd, but that's the type of lack of thought which often goes into the \"domino\" theory.\n \n If you still don't understand my point, then answer a question.\n HOW would the legalization of gay marriage CAUSE polygamy to be legalized? What aspect of legalizing gay marriage would help polygamy to be legalized?\n \n \n \nIt is if a legitimate state interest can never exist where the only justification for the law is a \"government interest in protecting order and morality.\"\n\n Did Lawrence say anything about \"protecting order\" not being an invalid justification?\n Since the answer is no, let's not put words into their mouths, shall we?\n \n And you're giving a reason for why LAWRENCE may be a \"domino\" in the issue of legalizing gay marriage. Which I agree it is...\n I'm talking about some who say that legalizing gay marriage is a domino leading to polygamy legalization.\n If we can agree that that particular domino claim is inaccurate and baseless, we can focus just on the domino issue of Lawrence =< gay marriage and/or other issues.\n \n \n \nThis is a different issue, because any race-based distinctions enjoy strict scrutiny review per the Equal Protection clause.\n\n Actually, ALL basis of discrimination enjoy some level of scrutiny under Equal Protection. Just because it isn't \"strict\" doesn't mean some level of scrutiny doesn't apply.\n Can you point to any significant differentiation between \"strict\" scrutiny and the intermediate scrutiny level for gender discrimination (which covers laws which make gender requirements for marriage would be, just like Loving pointed out that race requirements for marriage are strict scrutiny) which would make this significant?\n \n \n \nIn these issues (i.e. the ones in Lawrence), however, rational basis review is applied.\n\n In cases where sexual orientation is the defining factor for discrimination, I would agree.\n But for the issue of same-gender marriage, it is the GENDER of the marriage partners which define the discrimination, just like for Loving v Virginia it was the RACE of the marriage partners which defined the discrimination.\n \n \n \nWith the particular issue of sodomy, perhaps the claim of morality was \"arbitrary,\" but restricting sodomy was nevertheless part of our legal tradition.\n\n A \"legal tradition\" which existed in only 13 states, and not enforced except in isolated cases (like Lawrence) or in more frequent cases of rape.\n \n \n \nIn instances where the restriction is not part of our traditions, then I think a different case exists.\n\n I find \"tradition\" to be a very shallow excuse for discrimination.\n Our country had a \"history\" of preventing interracial marriage. Our country had a \"history\" of segregation.\n Our country has a \"history\" of lots of discriminatory practices that were thrown out. Just because a discrimination has been practiced for a while doesn't lend it credence...",

It borders on dishonesty to make such a claim, when their ruling can be read and \"did not like\" can nowhere be found.\n The reason they will not follow SCALIA'S (and please be accurate in describing it as such) logic is because they did not rule on scalia's logic. There are other issues at work here.\n If you want a real discussion on this, then please discuss what they ACTUALLY are saying and the ACTUAL standards at work instead of Scalia's absurd combination of strawman and domino.\n Scalia INACCURATELY assesses what the court ACTUALLY said.\n I suggest you deal with what the court ACTUALLY said instead of relying on Scalia's inaccurate paraphrasal of it.\n\n \n To be honest, I like discussing these things because I happen to have read and thought a lot about legal theory and constitutional law. But I am finding it a bit hard to converse with you when you insist that I have only stated some fantasy that I have.\n \n I know that the court never said that they invalidated the law just because they did not like it. But the Lochner court never said as much, though most scholars agree that this is what that court did on economic regulations. We have to look at the analysis and then draw a conclusion. Let me try to explain this again.\n \n Here is why the court invalidated the law:\n \n \n\"Our prior cases make two propositions abundantly clear. First, the fact that the governing majority in a State has traditionally viewed a particular practice as immoral is not a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting the practice; neither history nor tradition could save a law prohibiting miscegenation from constitutional attack. Second, individual decisions by married persons, concerning the intimacies of their physical relationship, even when not intended to produce offspring, are a form of \"liberty\" protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Moreover, this protection extends to intimate choices by unmarried as well as married persons.\" 478 U.S., at 216 (footnotes and citations omitted)...\n \n The Texas statute furthers no legitimate state interest which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual.\n \n\n \n Thus the court invalidated the law because the state's asserted interest, i.e., regulation of morality, was not legitimate. In other words, a legitimate interest can never exist in cases where the state asserts only a moral justification.\n \n Now to my analysis. I don't think anyone here expects that the court will invalidate certain laws that we all agree with, even though those laws can only be justified on a moral principle or preference. A couple of clear examples come to mind: bestiality or animal cruelty. The only basis for a law prohibiting these various behaviors is a moral one. So, if the court is to follow its logic to the end, then those laws would have to fall since morality alone does not constitute a legitimate state interest.\n \n So, we move from that fact to this question: why don't we expect the court to follow its logic to the end? Why won't they do it? I suggest that they are applying their logical selectively. How else, then, do they distinguish between which laws to invalidate, and which ones to keep? Personal preference. They like law X and don't like law Y. \n \n \nDo you realize that there are OTHER justifications for some laws BESIDES just arbitrary claims of \"morality\"?\n\n \n I do realize this. But then again, there are some laws whose only justification is a moral one.\n \n \nIf there are \"numerous asserted state justifications\", then I suggest you start citing precedent. \"incapability to procreate\" is the main one I have seen.\n If you want to talk about others, I suggest you bring them up.\n\n \n I'm not going to bother looking up the cases right now because it is not important. All that is important right now is that some legitimate interest has been asserted, not how many have been.\n \n \nAnd second, the point I made was clear. The \"domino\" theory doesn't apply to legalized gay marriage CAUSING polygamy legalization.\n Legalizing gay marriage would have to include some element which would CAUSE polygamy to be legalized as well. When in truth, they are unrelated.\n The only thing they have in common is the word \"marriage\" in their title.\n \n By such limited logic, I could claim that the overturning of laws which prohibit blacks from riding at the front of the bus would mean that the bus must also allow naked people to ride. Such a \"domino\" theory would be absurd, but that's the type of lack of thought which often goes into the \"domino\" theory.\n\n \n The point is that, according to Lawrence, any law based solely on a moral preference must fall because there can never be a legitimate state interest. So, by extension, if the only interest in prohibiting either gay marriage or polygamous marriage is a moral one, then the government has no legitimate interest, and such prohibitions are unconstitutional. Both prohibitions are in large part due to moral preferences, and that is how they are related.\n \n Again, I can't think of a reason other than a moral one to prohibit polygamy. If that is so, then the logic in Lawrence would actually require polygamy.\n \n \nIf you still don't understand my point, then answer a question.\n HOW would the legalization of gay marriage CAUSE polygamy to be legalized? What aspect of legalizing gay marriage would help polygamy to be legalized?\n \n Did Lawrence say anything about \"protecting order\" not being an invalid justification?\n And you're giving a reason for why LAWRENCE may be a \"domino\" in the issue of legalizing gay marriage. Which I agree it is...\n I'm talking about some who say that legalizing gay marriage is a domino leading to polygamy legalization.\n If we can agree that that particular domino claim is inaccurate and baseless, we can focus just on the domino issue of Lawrence =< gay marriage and/or other issues.\n \n\n \n We are not talking about legislation here, we are talking about the Supreme Court. It's the reasoning of the court that can do this. And this is how. If the only asserted justification for a law prohibiting both gay and polygamous marriage is a moral one, then Lawrence says that no legitimate interest exists, and both laws must fall.\n \n \nActually, ALL basis of discrimination enjoy some level of scrutiny under Equal Protection. Just because it isn't \"strict\" doesn't mean some level of scrutiny doesn't apply.\n Can you point to any significant differentiation between \"strict\" scrutiny and the intermediate scrutiny level for gender discrimination (which covers laws which make gender requirements for marriage would be, just like Loving pointed out that race requirements for marriage are strict scrutiny) which would make this significant?\n\n \n Right, but the three levels of scrutiny are more forceful according to a sort of scale. Rational basis is the lowest form, and it traditionally has not been that hard for a law to survive rational basis review.\n \n I don't really know the difference between strict scrutiny and intermediate scrutiny since intermediate scrutiny was made up out of thin air in 1976. The court decided they didn't like classifications based on gender, and decided to invent another standard of review since they didn't have the guts to say that gender qualifies as a suspect classification.\n \n Strict scrutiny analysis under the Equal Protection clause is reserved for when the law in question infringes on a suspect classification. Race has been held through that clause to be a suspect classification, and thus is subjected to strict scrutiny.\n \n I'm sure this is confusing, and perhaps I can explain this better in a separate post that only addresses this specific issue.\n \n \nIn cases where sexual orientation is the defining factor for discrimination, I would agree.\n But for the issue of same-gender marriage, it is the GENDER of the marriage partners which define the discrimination, just like for Loving v Virginia it was the RACE of the marriage partners which defined the discrimination.\n\n \n The point is that gender classifications and racial classifications are on a different plane. The state has more deference on rational basis and intermediate scrutiny review. Interracial marriage prohibitions had to fall because they were classifications based on race. Classifications based on gender (if indeed that is the issue, of which I'm not convinced) are different.\n \n \nA \"legal tradition\" which existed in only 13 states, and not enforced except in isolated cases (like Lawrence) or in more frequent cases of rape.\n\n \n Legal tradition does not look at the state of the law at the time in which the case is heard, it looks at the state of the law from the founding and at the times of the amendments. Sodomy has always been prohibited, but states began repealing their laws, which of course is perfectly fine for a legislature to do. The point is that no provision of the constitution was ever intended to protect sodomy.\n \n \nI find \"tradition\" to be a very shallow excuse for discrimination.\n Our country had a \"history\" of preventing interracial marriage. Our country had a \"history\" of segregation.\n Our country has a \"history\" of lots of discriminatory practices that were thrown out. Just because a discrimination has been practiced for a while doesn't lend it credence...\n\n \n You cite racial classifications here. These are different under Equal Protection analysis from gay marriage. And as far as Due Process analysis goes (which is what the court purports to have used), one can be deprived of liberty (i.e., the right to engage in sodomy) so long as it is done with due process of law. The constitution was never intended to establish a right to sodomy, hence the rational basis review. The constitution allows all types of discrimination, and some of them are even bad. Sometimes the constitution allows bad things, which is why we have a process to change the constitution: the amendment process. And this is how we got rid of most of the discriminations you are thinking of.",

But then again, there are some laws whose only justification is a moral one.\n\n Quite frankly, in YOUR OPINION some laws have only \"moral\" justification.\n You should prove this claim for your argument to proceed.\n \n \n \nI'm not going to bother looking up the cases right now because it is not important. All that is important right now is that some legitimate interest has been asserted, not how many have been.\n\n This started when I talked about \"capability to procreate\" being a barrier to gay marriage, and not to polygamy.\n I pointed out that \"capability to procreate\" was not a barrier for polygamy, and thus the \"domino\" of gay marriage was obviously NOT CONNECTED to the domino of polygamy.\n You balked at my assessment, yet refuse to provide any example of how my assessment is wrong.\n \n I'll take your demur as a non-sequitur.\n \n \n \nThe point is that, according to Lawrence, any law based solely on a moral preference must fall because there can never be a legitimate state interest. So, by extension, if the only interest in prohibiting either gay marriage or polygamous marriage is a moral one, then the government has no legitimate interest, and such prohibitions are unconstitutional.

   "I am cutting out the stuff that does not even justify a reply.\n \n \n\"some\"?\n Which states have laws against masturbation, fornication, or adultery?\n\n \n Well, I'm not willing to look at all 50 states to find out. But, I'll give you something to go on, and if you really want to know, then you can look up the relevant statutory law in the various states.\n \n Here we have an article from 2003 which says that \"more than twenty states\" have adultery as a crime.\n \n Here we have an article from 2004 which states that 10 states have laws prohibiting fornication and sex before marriage.\n \n That should suffice to make the point. These claims are not made up and they are not absurd. Some states still criminalize this behavior, and many more criminalized it in the past.\n \n \nThe states repealing these laws demonstrates a recognition of right to privacy. Not invading on people's private lives to declare private consensual acts which harm noone.\n\n \n I have no problem with states repealing these laws if they want to. But it is quite clear that the United States Constitution does not address the issues at all.\n \n \nRight to Privacy.\n\n \n The Constitution also has absolutely nothing to say about a general, undefined right to privacy.\n \n \nQuite frankly, I see animal cruelty as going well beyond a \"moral\" claim.\n I mean, it does have moral issues but it's not just a \"moral\" issue.\n It's akin to saying laws against murder are just there based on \"morality\"....\n\n \n Translation: you like animal cruelty laws. Therefore, they can stay. You no like sodomy laws. Therefore, they have to go.\n \n \nAnother assumption...\n Let's say the court does view animal abuse as purely and solely morally based.\n WHY are you assuming the court won't strike down those laws then?\n\n \n The point of the exercise is this: virtually nobody would entertain for even one nanosecond the idea that animal cruelty laws violate the Constitution. If you don't believe me, I will make a poll to prove it. So, if a judge did suggest this, then they would be promptly impeached.\n \n \nQuite frankly, in YOUR OPINION some laws have only \"moral\" justification.\n You should prove this claim for your argument to proceed.\n\n \n I have given an example: animal cruelty laws. I cannot think of another justification besides a moral one. You don't seem to be able to either. You insist that there is. But your longwindedness has apparently prevented you from articulating that mysterious justification.\n \n \nThis started when I talked about \"capability to procreate\" being a barrier to gay marriage, and not to polygamy.\n I pointed out that \"capability to procreate\" was not a barrier for polygamy, and thus the \"domino\" of gay marriage was obviously NOT CONNECTED to the domino of polygamy.\n You balked at my assessment, yet refuse to provide any example of how my assessment is wrong.\n \n I'll take your demur as a non-sequitur.\n\n \n The department of public health in Massachussetts asserted three state interests: 1) providing a \"favorable setting for procreation\"; (2) ensuring the optimal setting for child rearing, which the department defines as \"a two-parent family with one parent of each sex\"; and (3) preserving scarce State and private financial resources.\n \n There are three separate asserted interests from just one case.\n \n Or, how about the Washington case? \"[T]he legislature was entitled to believe that providing that only opposite-sex couples may marry will encourage procreation and child-rearing in a 'traditional' nuclear family where children tend to thrive.\"\n \n I'll dismiss your accusation of a non-sequitor as just another demonstration that you really don't know what you are talking about.\n \n \nPhyllis, I'm not confused.\n I'm also not confused on the fact that amongst that diatribe, you COMPLETELY AVOIDED MY QUESTION.\n I repeat: \"Can you point to any significant differentiation between \"strict\" scrutiny and the intermediate scrutiny level for gender discrimination (which covers laws which make gender requirements for marriage would be, just like Loving pointed out that race requirements for marriage are strict scrutiny) which would make this significant?\"\n\n \n I answered this. Read it again.\n \n \n\"are different\"?\n That's the best answer you've got?\n So by such logic, I could say \"religion and race are different, ergo a law requiring people be of the same race 'must fall' while a law requiring people to be of the same religion doesn't have to fall\".\n\n \n They're not different because I say so. They are different because the Supreme Court has always said so. It appears that I have misunderstood your repetition of legal jargon to mean that you actually know something about legal history. You apparently do not, so I doubt this conversation can go much further.\n \n \nLet's try a hypothetical here...\n As we have discussed, gender has a higher scrutiny level than other issues, with the exception of race.\n Ergo, by your limited analysis, if a requirement for marriage on gender can survive scrutiny, then obviously a requirement for marriage based on religion could survive scrutiny...\n \n Ergo, a law requiring people to be of the same religion to marry would be hypothetically constitutional, according to the limited argumentation you have laid out.\n Correct?\n\n \n The only thing that is limited here is your understanding. This is a comparison between apples an oranges. You need another example besides religion because the First Amendment would apply in the second instance, whereas it would not in the first.",

   "Phyllis:\n Now to my analysis. I don't think anyone here expects that the court will invalidate certain laws that we all agree with, even though those laws can only be justified on a moral principle or preference. A couple of clear examples come to mind: bestiality or animal cruelty. The only basis for a law prohibiting these various behaviors is a moral one. So, if the court is to follow its logic to the end, then those laws would have to fall since morality alone does not constitute a legitimate state interest.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n As far as I know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, beasts are unable to consent to whatever acts they become involved with. So basically the law stands to protect the beast, which in cases of beastiality is a victim. The same goes for animal cruelty laws. They are in place to protect animals as they are helpless victims. Sodomy between two consenting adults is none of your business. And do you think having laws prohibiting such a practice is stopping any of the people who engage in this practice? No it's not.",

So, rather than posting articles, how about you just give me the relevant provisions of the Constitution that establish a general, undefined right to privacy.\n \n \nConsidering you ignored the meat of what I said...\n Regardless, Gaetano just gave you an excellent example to help with my oversight.\n\n \n Gaetano's example, though it is quite laughable, still relies solely on a moral preference, i.e., \"consent.\" And how does the fact that animals cannot consent matter? How is it not just an arbitrary moral judgment that they should be protected because they cannot consent?\n \n \nJust out of curiousity, weren't these assertations REJECTED?\n\n \n And this matters how? I said that there were numerous asserted state justifications. It does not matter whether they were accepted or rejected.\n \n \nHad to wipe a tear from my eye laughing at that one.\n \"entitled to believe\"?\n In other words, they threw out a b.s. reason, TOTALLY unsubstantiated by facts, TOTALLY REFUTED by research, and let it stand.\n\n \n The court does not try to determine if the legislature is correct in their judgment, it determines whether it may make the judgment. In other words, the Washington Supreme Court said that the legislature is entitled to legislate. That's hardly as questionable as you make it out to be.\n \n \nAhhh.\n SCOTUS said so?\n It's not in legislation?\n So would this be a convenient point where you conveniently allow SCOTUS to make interpretations not established in text, yet you complain when they do so in areas you do not like?\n \n Precisely a point I was trying to make...\n\n \n For somebody who claims not to like it when people make assumptions, you sure don't hesitate to make some hearty ones yourself. \n \n I've had absolutely nothing to say about whether I think the use of those levels of scrutiny is legitimate, yet you assume that I must agree with their use.\n \n \nBut back to the REAL question, I NEVER ASKED WHO \"said so\".\n I was asking WHAT was different inbetween the scrutiny classifications of \"strict\" scrutiny and \"inter-mediate\" scrutiny that would necessitate a ruling AGAINST the discriminatory law in one case, and FOR the discriminatory law in the second case.\n\n \n I really did already answer this. I suggest you go back and read.\n \n \nYou don't show how the anti-gay marriage laws satisfy \"inter-mediate\" scrutiny.\n \n And THAT is the basis of my question.\n\n \n I didn't realize this is what you were asking. Laws against gay marriage do not have to satisfy intermediate scrutiny. They are evaluated on a standard of rational basis because the classification is not drawn according to gender. Both males and females are allowed to marry.\n \n \nIt's funny how on one hand, you claim that \"strict scrutiny\" is higher, and use that as a blanket assumption for why lesser scrutinies would be satisfied...\n ... but on the other hand, you complain about \"apples and oranges\"...\n \n You can't have it both ways.\n\n \n I haven't tried to have it both ways. If you have a classification that is drawn around race, the 14th Amendment is applied. If you have a classification drawn around religion, the 1st Amendment is applied. I haven't complained about that. It is a very simple concept that is actually quite clear. And that is what I mean by apples and oranges.\n \n \nSuppose a law was established that prevented people of different handicaps from marrying.\n Would that be allowable under your interpretation?\n\n \n I do not find it particularly profitable to discuss hypothetical examples that will never happen. But I will answer anyway. The Constitution may permit it, but federal statute would not.",

   "I already did. And at least 3 state SCs agreed.\n\n Where?\n Tell me which post you showed a REASON WHY preventing gay marriage is not gender discrimination.\n \n I'm not asking you to show me somewhere or somebody who AGREES, but rather the REASON WHY.\n \n \n \nI didn't. That's why I said that polygamists were in te same boat as gays. \n\n That's an odd reply.\n I just asked: \"Where did I say I didn't recognize that they \"don't meet the definition of marriage\"? \"\n And you reply that YOU didn't.\n \n Let me repeat the question.\n \"Where did I say I didn't recognize that they \"don't meet the definition of marriage\"? \"\n \n \n \nActually, gays don't meet the Federal definition either.\n\n Actually, the definition states nothing about gays.\n A gay man can marry a gay woman.\n A straight man cannot marry a straight man.\n The definition discriminates according to GENDER.\n \n \n \nNo, you attempted to manipulate my words. \n\n That's a rather lame claim, considering I EXPLAINED WHY your words were interpreted as they were (you referred to THE supreme court, and with a singular reference as well).\n No \"manipulation\".\n At best, somewhere inbetween a poor choice of words on your part, or a poor interpretation on mine.\n \n \n \nBy refusing to hear the following, they may have let their intent be known. Who knows?\n\n Actually, considering they typically give reasons for why they refuse to hear a case, it seems rather obvious that it IS known.\n You just wish to read into it something which is convenient for your cause...",

   "Where do people turn to for justice when the people and the legislature have denied them justice? Why should people be allowed to vote on my marriage or your marriage? Where did the right to decide who I or you get to marry comes from? Are you suggesting that gay people, who are denied justice take to the streets in open rebellion or civil war? You will not allow them acceses to the courts and have denied them their civil rights. Wars have been fought over less.\n\n \n Thank God for the Second Amendment. emoticon_xkill emoticon_xgood",
