   "The Health Committee in the Scottish Parliament has recently backed the Scottish Socialist's bill for free prescription charges for all. If the bill is passed through the Scottish Parliament this would mean that every Man, Women and Child regardless of income would not have to pay a fee when they pick up prescriptions from the pharmacy.\n \n In principle I am all for this measure, as the NHS was setup as a 'free' Health Service at the point of need and prescription charges seem to go against this principle. \n \n My main concerns are the costs involved. At the moment it costs about &#163;6 when you pick up your prescription, if the fees are abolished then this removes a stream of revenue from the NHS, this could in turn effect the level of service from the NHS.\n \n http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4600678.stm\n \n So what do you guys think of the idea ?",

   "The issue seems to be if public spending can absorb the shortfall from eliminating all charges to all people. If only 8% of the population is going without prescriptions due to inability to pay, common sense would say subsidize that sector, not eliminate all charges. But, as in the US, politicians have found that far it's easier to buy support using public funds than shelling out party contributions.",

I would be interested to see the cost of scrapping prescription charges compared to savings made from less red tape. I bet the cost would not be as steep with this taken into consideration.\n \n \nThe problem with the current prescription system is that it is means tested, and the means testing takes months.
