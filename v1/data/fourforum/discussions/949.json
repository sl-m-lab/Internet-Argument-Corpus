   "montalban, what you seem to be getting at is that you don't trust science. Asking whether evidence is enough is a pretty strange point to be making. I could show you a green apple and provide evidence that indeed the apple is green, but is that enough? How can we be sure what green is? How can we be sure the lighting in the room isn't changing the real color of the apple? Proof is simply the belief in the evidence. If you are bent on denying that the apple is green no matter what, then you have essentially seen no proof that it is green or are not willing to admit you have seen proof that it is green.\n \n So how much evidence are we talking here? If you were shown an example of evolution, would you believe it? An example of it would be seen only as evidence since you could debate that it didn't evolve, God just put it here a few years or hundreds of years ago to make you think it evolved. Since God is all powerful using Christian ideas, then he could have done something to make evolution appear to be true although it may not be.\n \n And what is your definition of evolution? Are we talking the entire theory of evolution, from bacteria to human, step by step up the evolutionary ladder or are we talking evolution of a single species to another species? Are we talking macroevolution or microevolution?\n \n I'll throw in a personal question. Would you be willing to accept evolution as truth if you seen tomorrow that a dog which walked on two legs and had wings and could fly was born of your neighbors dog? Just to show what my personal feelings are on God, if I seen him appear in the sky right now and waved at me, I'd drop all my previous ideas and accept that he exists without hesitation. I'd actually do it for far less proof than this. How much evidence do you need? What type of evidence do you need? What is your definition of evidence if you feel you need to give it to explain your position? What is your definition of proof? Does it need to be physically proven, visually proven, historically proven, proven on paper, does God need to be disproven for this to be proven, what type of proof/evidence do you need?",

   "Darwinists keep telling me that Evolution is fact, because of all the evidences. However, evidence only points to something, when you give it direction.\n\n I think maybe you have twisted that a bit. Evolution is a fact because evolution has been observed. There is no question that events that meet the definition of evolution have been observed. OK? Evolution is a fact because evolution has been observed. The data are the facts of evolution. I know I'm going to have to say that in a lot of ways several more times before you catch it. Evolution is not a fact because of the evidence, the facts of evolution are the evidence. Observe, hypothesize, predict, test. The facts that are the evidence are also the evidence. The direction that you think is necessary are the next three steps. Those steps are why \"creation science\" is pseudoscience. In fact, \"creation scientists\" use the observations made by scientists and then offer ad hoc stories to \"give direction\" to the evidence and make it fit the conclusion they promised to reach before they started.\n \nAnyone can use scientific evidence. As long as people have agendas, science can't be treated as objective truth. Science, or scientific facts can be used to show a number of proofs, depending upon your own personal bias.*\n\n Yes. That's what creationists do. They skip the part about hypothesis, prediction and testing and make the facts conform to their agenda - POOF! GODDIDIT!\n \nYou've seen the ads, \"Buy BRAND X Fat Controller - Results Guaranteed\" by laboratory testing, of course\n\n But that's not science. Are you so easily taken in by salesmen?\n \nThere is of course a more insidious uses of science. In the early 1970s a group of radical feminists went so far as you science to suggest that it was physically impossible for a woman to achieve sexual orgasm whilst having penetrative sex. Even if the woman experienced an orgasm, she was said to be deceiving her self.... \"That even in a woman?s sexuality, there is deceit on the part of men, and complacency on the part of some women\" in Koedt, A. \"The Myth of Vaginal Orgasm.\" \n in Koedt, A. & Levine, E. & Rapone, A., (eds.). (1973). \"Radical Feminism\". Quadrangle Books, New York, p204**\n\n I see. So you must be a female to know for a fact that this is false. Actually I'm not interested in that kind of science and I don't care. I haven't seen the papers but I suspect the book was written for mercenary reasons. What does that have to do with cosmology, physics, astrophysics, geology, molecular biology, genetics and on and on? Someone mentioned that you seem to mistrust science and it seems that you do.\n \nSure, they were a minority, but a group with a clear agenda... And they used scientific research to back their case! There are even worse cases that have arisen, such as detailed in the article \"THE SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND OF THE NAZI EUGENICS PROGRAM\n\n So how is misuse of science a valid argument against the correct application of the scientific method? Hitler also claimed he was doing his Christian duty. He admired Martin Luther very much. If you're going to ride the Nazi horse, you can't leave the head behind and just be the horses XXX.\n \nThese last two cases are of course not the norm, but they indicate the wide-range of ideas that can be routinized by the judicious quoting of scientific authority.\n\n And you have just described \"creation science.\" No application of the scientific method. No testing. The conclusions are known before the judicious quoting of scientific authority has even begun. I notice that you use one of those quotes of a scientific authority below. You show that you are what you decry.\n \nIf there are many people reading this that already believe in evolution, or for that matter, believe in biblical creationism, then it is important to keep in mind that the people appealing to science have biases at work, regardless of how objectively rationalistic they present themselves.\n\n Well, I don't believe in evolution. I believe in things for which I have no evidence. And while it is true that everyone has bias, using correct science and the process of peer review works to eliminate. Not all is perfect, and people are people, but overall the system works. Not a lot of bad science gets through. In the case of \"creation science\" we know that there is no science involved. Only talk that sounds scientific. There is no hypothesis, prediction or testing. Only ad hoc stories constructed of selected bits of evidence to support the foregone conclusion.\n \nIt is wrong to believe that because someone believes in the Bible that they are less rational than someone who is an atheist.\n\n Not at all. But how is that relevant to the discussion of science and \"creation science?\" What does the Bible and atheism have to do with science? You aren't seriously suggesting that a scientist in a field that conflicts with your particular religious superstition is an atheist, are you?\n \nDo atheist's have an agenda? That is a question you can ask yourselves- what is it that atheists are trying to persuade you to? It would be wrong to portray scientists as paragons of objectiveness and virtue.\n\n And again, how is this relevant to a discussion of science as opposed to \"creation science?\" What does virtue have to do with it? To be honest, I have never been impressed by the superior virtue of christians anyway. The highest divorce rate of any population in the country is among born again christians (Gallup). I haven't been divorced and have never cheated on my wife. Who is more virtuous?\n \nHaving loads of evidence means nothing. I've seen much evolutionary evidence that is contradictory. I've seen scientists who say the world is very old, then other scientists who use the same evidences to say that the world is young.\n\n You've seen much evolutionary evidence that is contradictory? Present it and cite the scientific literature if you please. Links to creationist web sites isn't evidence. Such sites are doing exactly what you have been claiming above. They are playing their bias. As for those scientists, my bet is that of those with relevant credentials to the question of the age of the earth, 99% accept that it is about 4.6 billion years old. You do understand the the opinion of a hydrologic engineer or a biochemist isn't relevant. I'll bet that I've \"seen\" more scientists than you have and I can't recall any who thought that the earth was less than 10,000 years old. Let's see the names and affiliations.\n \n By the way, evidence is everything since that is the starting point for the hypothesis, prediction and testing.\n \nColin Patterson of the British Museum would go from conference to conference asking evolutionaries this question, which I now put to you, Dear Reader \n \"Can you tell me one thing about evolution that is true - any one thing at all?\" \n (quoted in Woodward, T \"Doubts About Evolution: A History of Intelligent Design\", p43)\n\n I suspect that you are a dupe on this one. You are propagating a lie. Colin Patterson didn't go from conference to conference - that is a lie. And he didn't give a \"keynote\" address at a conference. He coordinated an informal discussion with a group of systemicists. Karl already asked that you support this last assertion. But of course, you won't be able to because it isn't true. The question is if it is your source that is lying or you?\n \n Here is the real story. Patterson Misquoted: A Tale of Two 'Cites'\n \n So I keep asking the question but I get no answers. Does anyone have evidence to support the creationists position? Every time I ask notsofast quickly disappears. Montalban claims an eye witness and then offers the creation mythology of bronze age, nomadic herdsmen. Is there any evidence at all that can be examined by the scientific method that will support creation in 6 days 6,000 years ago. Or even the other creation myth of a garden and the creation of a single man and the subsequent cloning of another man (Adam and Steve) from a rib? Is it a miracle that Adam's Y chromosome disappeared and another X chromosome appeared in this rib that became a woman?\n \n I ask, is this science or mythology?",

   "One thing to note here is how the word evolution is used.\n\n Good idea. Since we are talking about evolutionary biology, we need to use the word as evolutionary biologists do. Otherwise we speak gibberish. Here's what biologists mean.\n \n First, there is the definition of evolution. Evolution is a change in the frequency in alleles in a population over time. What that means is that evolution is defined as a change in the relative ratios of the heritable factors that cause the expression of physical characteristics in an organism. These changes are relevant only to an entire population or organisms. A population is a group of randomly interbreeding organisms. And by time, we mean from generation to generation.\n \n Second are the facts of evolution. Those are changes that conform to the above definition. Thus, a dog that gave birth to a cat, as so many creationists demand as \"proof\", isn't evolution. It is a miracle that might be expected from the creationist position. An examples of this second meaning is the change of the peppered moth in industrialized areas of England from the light \"peppered\" morph to the black morph in about 50 years. From less than 1% black, the moth changed to 98% black. By the way, this change is known to be caused by a single point mutation to a single gene. It has been observed to arise in other species of moths. When the industrial polution was cleaned up, the peppered moths reverted to the wild form in about 50 years, such that the black morphs are now about 2% of the population. If you need other observed facts of evolution, I can provide them.\n \n Third are the theories that explain why the facts that conform to the definition occur. Several mechanisms of this change have been identified. Several fields of science have confirmed these theories - genetics, population genetics, molecular biology, ecology and so on. Testing of the theory for the last 150 years has produced only confirmation that it is correct.\n \nFirst of all evolution is fact if you define it as microevolution.\n\n Can you define microevolution? But then you are confused. Microevolution is evolution that is below the level of species. Evolutionary biologists don't really use the term much. I first heard if from a creationist.\n \nThat can be proven.\n\n No it can't. Scientific theories aren't \"proven\". You can observe the fact of gravity but you can't \"prove\" that the theory that explains it is correct. In fact, the theory of gravitation is one of the least secure theories of modern science.\n \nMacroevolution is tougher to prove, but through a series of microevolutions you can get a new species which can appear similar to macroevolution.\n\n Again, there is no proof. But unless someone can offer evidence that there exists some observable barrier to speciation (that is \"specification\" for the scientifically illiterate), then macro evolution is possible. We know that macroevolution is a fact. Even montalban offered the example of the Great Dane and the Chihuahua. Even through artificial insemination the embryos are not viable, and we know that dogs are the same species.\n \nThe jump from modern apes to humans would be a case of macroevolution. As was said in your quote, the theory is plausible but i may be false. So what they of evolution was Gould talking about?\n\n The case of a jump from modern apes to humans would be a case of a miracle, which is more compatible with creationism that with evolution. Such a statement is ignorant at best and an intentional lie otherwise. No one claims that humans \"jumped\" from modern apes. The human lineage separated from the chimpanzees some 5 to 7 million years ago. In that time, humans have evolved several genra and species, all of which have gone extinct except for us. Chimps have also speciated, but they live in an environment that isn't condusive to fossilization. But we know of two chimp species. A few million years earlier the chimp/human lineage separated from the apes that eventually became the gorillas, and the Orangs before that. The point is that humans didn't spring from modern apes. Apes have evolved as much as we have.\n \n Everything after \"the theory is plausible but...\" is gibberish.\n \n I've snipped the discussion about a miraculous, bipedal dog as an example of evolution. It isn't. Evolution doesn't claim that cats are born from dogs or that bipedal horses are born or any of that stuff. That is creationist claptrap. The whole scenario is nothing more than the creationist cartoon version of evolution. If you invent a cartoon that isn't claimed by evolutionary theory and then prove it wrong, what have you accomplished. I think you have shown one of two things: ingnorance or dishonesty.\n \n [snip of more claptrap about cyberdogs and scientific coverups]\n \n A note to montalban: there is no such thing as a \"random bout of evolution.\" If you wish to oppose something, wouldn't it be a good idea to learn the basics of that which you oppose? You make yourself look foolish.\n \n [snip of miscellaneous religious claptrap]\n \n I notice that montalban asks, \"what is the definition of evidence.\" The same question that he was not able to answer when it was asked of him.\n \nWe follow the Bible, and Holy Tradition - which we see as the Bible as best understood. This tradition is taught to us by the Holy Fathers.\n\n Then you are a Roman Catholic. To a fundamentalist christian \"holy tradition\" doesn't exist.\n [snip of we are right and everyone else is wrong spew]\n \nWe also believe in accepting mysteries.\n\n I have no idea what that means.",

   "Can you define microevolution? But then you are confused. Microevolution is evolution that is below the level of species. Evolutionary biologists don't really use the term much. I first heard if from a creationist.\n\n \n Microevolution - evolution resulting from small specific genetic changes that can lead to a new subspecies\n \n Subspecies - a taxonomic group that is a division of a species; usually arises as a consequence of geographical isolation within a species\n \n Isn't your example of the herrings an example of this? I'm under the impression that it is but if I'm wrong could you explain why?\n \n \nNo it can't. Scientific theories aren't \"proven\". You can observe the fact of gravity but you can't \"prove\" that the theory that explains it is correct. In fact, the theory of gravitation is one of the least secure theories of modern science.\n\n \n Ah yes. This goes to show that my vocabulary simply isn't that of a true scientist. I tend to believe gravity is proven if it can be observed just as I believe anything else is proven if observed. But I should have remembered that as I said in my previous post, nothing is proven by evidence if you don't believe in the evidence. Proof is a pretty loose term.\n \n \nThe case of a jump from modern apes to humans would be a case of a miracle, which is more compatible with creationism that with evolution. Such a statement is ignorant at best and an intentional lie otherwise. No one claims that humans \"jumped\" from modern apes. The human lineage separated from the chimpanzees some 5 to 7 million years ago.\n\n \n Intentional lie? What is your definition of jump from one species to the next? A jump in my view isn't just one step although you can view it as that. If we evolved directly from ape to human over 5 to 7 million years, why wouldn't you consider that a jump? I suppose I could have used a better word, but to say that it was an intentional lie is surprising. As you would also remember, your the one who explained evolution from one species to the next to me.\n \n \nI've snipped the discussion about a miraculous, bipedal dog as an example of evolution. It isn't. Evolution doesn't claim that cats are born from dogs or that bipedal horses are born or any of that stuff. That is creationist claptrap. The whole scenario is nothing more than the creationist cartoon version of evolution. If you invent a cartoon that isn't claimed by evolutionary theory and then prove it wrong, what have you accomplished. I think you have shown one of two things: ingnorance or dishonesty.\n\n \n Are you sure that it isn't a case of evolution? Evolutionary theory may not claim that such things are possible, but are you saying that the definition of evolution wouldn't consider this to be an evolution?\n \n You claim I'm ignorant and dishonest now? How about yourself? Define evolution and explain how my example isn't evolution. Don't try to pass it off as not being realistic therefore it isn't evolution. You specifically said it isn't evolution at all even if it did happen.\n \n \nAMD4EVER, sorry, but you actually sound a bit like a salesman on an ad... what would it take to convince me to believe in evolution?

   "Microevolution - evolution resulting from small specific genetic changes that can lead to a new subspecies\n \n Subspecies - a taxonomic group that is a division of a species; usually arises as a consequence of geographical isolation within a species\n \n Isn't your example of the herrings an example of this? I'm under the impression that it is but if I'm wrong could you explain why?\n\n Herring gulls.\n \n Herring gulls interbreed with American herring gulls.\n American herring gulls interbreed with Vega herring gulls.\n Vega herring gulls interbreed with Birula's gulls.\n Birula's gulls interbreed with Heuglin's gulls.\n Heuglin's gulls interbreed with Siberian lesser black-backed gulls.\n Siberian lesser black-backed gulls interbreed with Lesser black-backed gulls.\n Herring gulls and Lesser black-backed gulls share a common range. They do not interbreed.\n \n So according to the fixed definition that montalban wants to use, Herring gulls and lesser black-backed gulls are separate species. They don't look alike. So is that microevolution? It can but doesn't have to lead to a new species. So what I have described above is micro-evolution + micro-evolution + micro-evolution + micro-evolution + micro-evolution = macro-evolution. In fact, some of the gulls above are classified as separate species, some as subspecies. Here are the scientific names of the gulls mentioned above.\n \n Larus argentatus argentatus\n Larus argentatus smithsonianus\n Larus vegae vegae\n Larus vegae birulai\n Larus heuglini\n Larus taimyrensis\n Larus fuscus graellsii\n \n And that doesn't even cover the ground. There are some 27 named species of Larus. Others range along the coasts of the continents. The above named birds ring the Arctic Ocean. But among these birds, adjacent populations, even though they may be named species, are known to interbreed. Lots of micro-evolution. Except where this vast mish-mash of species and subspecies meet after encircling the globe. There the Herring gull and the Lesser black-backed gull don't interbreed even though they share a common range. Actually, they don't seem to interbreed. It is suspected that they may still be able to but I don't think it has been verified.\n \n So you tell me what is going on. Is that micro or macro?\n \nAh yes. This goes to show that my vocabulary simply isn't that of a true scientist. I tend to believe gravity is proven if it can be observed just as I believe anything else is proven if observed. But I should have remembered that as I said in my previous post, nothing is proven by evidence if you don't believe in the evidence. Proof is a pretty loose term.\n\n OK, then I'll cut you some slack if you promise to make an effort to understand the concepts. It would help if you indicated that you were unsure rather than making an assertion.\n \n Scientists don't usually state that a theory has been proven. In a scientific theory there is always the implicit assumption that additional data may be found that will cause the theory to be changed. Scientific theories are not claimed to be absolute truth forevermore. They are the best explanations that we have been able to devise that accounts for all the data. Sometimes there are bits of data around the edges that isn't adequatly accounted for, and that is where scientific investigation goes on.\n \n So you don't believe the evidence? Possible. I'll give you an example. Evidence from geology indicates that North America, Europe, South America, and Africa were once joined. There are strata that match across the Atlantic. More than being similar, they are identical. It was hypothesized that the continents were once joined and were moving apart. The idea didn't acceptance. Qualified scientists didn't accept the evidence. But with satilites and lasers, the movement of the continents has been measured. The science is a subfield of geology known as plate tectonics and it explains lots of things that were never understood before - vulcanism, earthquakes, mountain building, and moving continents among them. But volcanos, earthquakes, growing mountains, and moving continents are the data. Those are the facts of plate tectonics. Do they prove it? Sure, to the extent that you have observed gravity and others have observed evolution. But that isn't the point. Science isn't an accumulation of facts and observations. Science attempts to explain the mechanisms. Why do continents move? Why do objects fall earth? Why does the earth orbit the sun? Why do populations of living organisms change with time? Those are the theories. You are stuck on the observation and skip the next three steps. None of it is useful unless we can explain why it happens because we can't make use of it until we understand and can control the causes.\n \nIntentional lie? What is your definition of jump from one species to the next? A jump in my view isn't just one step although you can view it as that. If we evolved directly from ape to human over 5 to 7 million years, why wouldn't you consider that a jump? I suppose I could have used a better word, but to say that it was an intentional lie is surprising. As you would also remember, your the one who explained evolution from one species to the next to me.\n\n OK. Let me retract. I seem to have misunderstood what your intent. You will see the argument from creationists often. \"Show me a cat that give birth to a dog,\" they demand, \"and then I'll believe in evolution.\" But evolution doesn't jump. Your comment about \"modern apes\" certainly didn't help. We aren't descended from modern apes. We were separated from chimps about 5 to 7 million years ago. As it is evident that we no longer look like chimps, we must have evolved. But in that time, the chimp has evolved as we have. In fact, there are two species of chimps (they do not interbreed, although it is unknown if they can interbreed).\n \n Some years ago there was an hypothesis that proposed jumps in species. It was sometimes called the \"hopeful\" monster hypothesis. But we don't see that happening. Even very rapid evolution happens at a rate that spans human life times. Perhaps you saw the thread where montalban referenced the book that he didn't read, \"The Beak of the Finch.\" After many years (the book covers 20) of studying the finches, capturing and measuring every bird on the island, they tracked several characteristics. They thought that that eventually they would see some sort of evolution if they watched long enough. They succeeded beyond their imagination. But it was a severe drought that reduced the food available, and reduced population sizes and stressed them to the extent that the Grants measured changes in the size of the beaks of the finches across both populations. And they observed a case of interspecies mating. (evolution is a fact - the Grants observed it).\n \n So in summary, if you can show a jump as the typical creationist damands (from one species to another in a single generation), you will have falsified the theory of evolution. It hasn't been observed to happen and the theory doesn't claim that it does. But herring gulls show how it does happen. By the way, I know of two more ring species off the top of my head. They are ring species because they \"ring\" an area that is not suitable. There are salamanders around the central valley of California and another is a species of bird around the Tibetan plateau. There may be more that I am not familiar with.\n \nAre you sure that it isn't a case of evolution? Evolutionary theory may not claim that such things are possible, but are you saying that the definition of evolution wouldn't consider this to be an evolution?\n \n You claim I'm ignorant and dishonest now? How about yourself? Define evolution and explain how my example isn't evolution. Don't try to pass it off as not being realistic therefore it isn't evolution. You specifically said it isn't evolution at all even if it did happen.\n\n The above was a reference to a bipedal dog. Am I saying that that evolutionary theory wouldn't consider such cases to be evolution? That is exactly what I am saying. There are no observations (facts) that indicate that it is possible. Such an event would cause all kinds of serious problems to evolutionary theory.\n \n So I will define evolution. Evolution is a change in the frequency of alleles in a population over time.\n \n Why isn't your example evolution? Because what counts is if this bipedal horse survives and is able to mate and pass along those genes. Now, if this were to happen in your stable, I'm sure you would go to any extreme to make sure of offspring. But in nature, say in a wild horse population, would it be able to reproduce? Evolution is a matter of passing on beneficial, and even neutral genes. In any case, your horse is saltation - the hopeful monster hypothesis of Goldschmidt. It was rejected for lack of evidence before I pooped my first nappy.\n \n And since you ask, I am ignorant of many things. Two of them are not evolutionary biology and theology. Generally speaking, I am more informed about physics, geology, and chemistry that the average. I have even attempted to inform myself about cosmology. Besides that, I speak two languages and at one time could read Latin. I have read major parts of the ICR and AIG web sites (they are what I call creationists - if it doesn't fit, then don't claim that you are one). In fact, I have read more creationist XXXX that most creationists have.\n \n But still, I am ignorant of many things. However, should I ever find that my first inclination is to oppose something of which I am ignorant, I would have the integrity to educate myself in at least the basics of that topic so that I might oppose it with some intelligence. And if I am ignorant, then I do not challenge those who know more than I. Rather I question openly without an agenda to discredit what I don't understand. I don't see that happening here.",

Evolution theory assumes a living organism. If you want to postulate your magical sky man to POOF it into existance, that isn't relevant to evolutionary theory. The biological theory of evolution deals with living organisms and how they change and the mechanism that cause that change. If it isn't alive with heritable characteristics, it isn't evolution.\n \nLurch...The facts that are the evidence are also the evidence.\n \n Wow!

More than 99% of biologists are evolutionists. The numbers are similar for geologists, paleontoligists, and others. Overall, 95% of degreed scientists also accept the theory of evolution. And of those who support creation, none has actually published a paper that supports creationism in any peer reviewed scientific journal.\n \nAnyway, enough of dissecting your work.\n\n Said the pickled frog to the biology student.\n \n I'm hoping that here will follow some actual evidence or a statement of theory for creationism. I've been asking for several years now, but have only been offered mythology. So here it is! Evidence for creationism!\n \nWhen we look at the fossil record... we observe fossils! To draw a line between one fossil and another is speculation.\n\n Only a little. We can look at any fossil and tell if it is a vertebrate. We can tell if it is a tetrapod. We can tell if it is a mammal. By bet is that you don't know why we can tell any of the above.\n \nThat is why there is no clear-cut way in which any one creature is supposed to have arisen from another.\n\n But every creature is descended from another. Even creationists assert that. Evolutionary theory doesn't claim to know specific organisms, but only the general patterns revealed by the rare fossils that have been found.\n \nIn another tract I talked of how Darwin's Finch is all the same species.\n\n And you were wrong by your own definition. Not all species of Darwin's finch can interbreed. You assumed that because two species of closely related finches had been observed to interbreed on rare occasions the all of them do. That is not true.\n \nSomeone once suggested to me that the lines between species is not clear-cut.\n\n And they are not. Creationists need them to be but reality doesn't agree. Please study the gulls that I have discussed in other threads and tell us which are species and which are not. You may need it to be clear cut in order to believe in you magical sky man, but reality just doesn't agree.\n \nHowever, the fossils don't bare out this blurring. In fact the fossils are evidence for both gradualism, and not (...this being the theory of punctuated equilibrium).\n\n By \"bare\" fossils do you mean fossils without clothes? Actually, that bit of spew doesn't make sense. Since you mentioned it, I suspect that you can't tell me what the theory of PunkEek is. I dare you. If you think that it is somehow in opposition to gradualism you need to go and educate yourself before you make yourself look foolish.\n \nSo, anyway, to boil it all down to one question... \"Where has evolution been observed?\"\n\n I have given many examples. And R2D2 chastizes me for being consescending!\n \n YO! Dude! Pay attention! We are above the 3rd grade here.\n \nAMD4EVER tries to get this argument over micro or macro, but quite clearly Lurch and I understand, when talking about the problem of evolution, we're talking the latter... and it is in that light the above question is meant.... just in case you want to leap into another game of semantics.\n\n There isn't a difference between macro and micro except for a matter of convenience.

So who is Otto and why should whatever he says be authoritative? I don't know of any qualified biologist who would disagree with what I've said. How is \"I've heard of a bloke\" meaningful? My wife's nephew has a cousin who know a guy who has a brother who's son claims that Jesus was XXXXX. There you go. My assertion is as valid as yours.",

   "There are some people trying to draw distinctions between evolution and abiogenesis (which is sometimes called 'chemical evolution').\n \n \"Our hypothetical nucleic acid synthesis system is therefore analogous to the scaffolding used in the construction of a building. After the building has been erected the scaffolding is removed, leaving no physical evidence that it was ever three. Most of the statements in this section must therefore be taken as educated guesses. Without having witnessed the event, it seems unlikely that we shall ever be certain of how life arose.\" (D Voet and J G Voet \"Biochemistry\" 1995, p23)\n \n Most people that deal with evolution do tend to start with the very beginning. But, when it is inconvenient, as now, some will back away from this. In other words, in dealing with a study on life, we must look at how that life came about.\n \n To illustrate how Darwinian evolution is an over-arching all-encompassing system, there are plenty of web-sites that don't just deal with biological evolution, but also the origins of life, the formation of planets, the very beginning of time itself...\n \n Darwin himself hypothesised a 'primordial soup' \n \n Here, for your information... \n Dawkins, Richard. 1996. \"Climbing mount improbable.\" W.W. Norton, New York. pp. 282-3.

How many more references would you need to convince you? Why? Can you not make the connexion? Most evolutionary writers can! It is because a significant number of evolutionary writers are atheists. Therefore there is a need to connect a spontaneous origins of the universe, the Earth, life, etc. \n IF I have linked these two concepts it is because your evolutionary writers such as Dawkins has. If you believe that I am mistaken for doing so, then you must also believe that they are mistaken for doing so. I expect you'll want to write to them right away too! \n \n When an evolutionary such as Dawkins talks about how evolution has displaced the need for God, then I guess too, I can talk about the implications of Darwinian theory in a theological debate...\n \n The fact remains, abiogenesis has not been observed.

The discovery of \"Zinj\" made the Leakeys famous. Louis wrote an article for the National Geographic magazine and estimated that Zinjanthropus was 600,000 years old, in which he was wrong. Using a new method of dating, the carbon-14 technique, geophysicists from the University of California at Berkeley concluded that the site was 1.75 million years old. But the excavations brought to light a rich fossil fauna.\" \n http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/leakey.htm \n \"Louis Leakey died in London on October 3, 1969. In 1972 his son Richard Leakey, who directed National Museum of Kenya, reported the discovery of a 1.8 million-year old skull of modern humans from Koobi Fora. Three years later he discovered the skull of Homo erectus, estimated at 1.6 million years old, and in 1984 he and another palaeontologist discovered a virtually complete Homo erectus skeleton. In 1989 Richard Leakey abandoned fossil hunting for wildlife conservation. President Daniel Arap Moi appointed Leakey head of what is now the Kenya Wildlife Service. He signed in 1994 amid politically motivated accusations of mismanagement, only to be reinstated by Moi 4,5 years later. As a result of an airplane crash, Leakey lost both legs below the knees, but he has continued his scientific explorations.

Thus having a 'transitional' doesn't even imply that species moved the one way!\n\n Montalban, the link you provided is to a very short, very uninformative paragraph. I looked up the article in New Scientist that it referenced, and here is what I found:\n \n The New Scientist article (\"Descent of man - or ascent of ape?\", by John Gribbon and Jeremy Cherfas, 3 Sept 1981) was written over 20 years ago. At the time it was commonly believed that humans split from the apes over 20 million years ago, but recent (at that time) molecular evidence was suggesting more like four and a half million years ago. This was a huge change in our assumptions. At the time there weren't all that many known species of hominids, and so there was a lot of speculation going on as to the proper interpretation of the evidence.\n \n Now in the article, Gribbon (who isn't even a biologist) and Cherfas, writing this article for a popular science magazine (not a technical journal) were clearly having a lot of fun making some out-of-the-box speculations. They were suggesting that at the split between humans and other contemporary apes, one branch, the Homo line, led to humans, and the Autralopithecas line is ancestral to the gorilla and chimpanzee.\n \n I note: this was idle speculation by people were not workers in the field. Interesting, but this idea was not published in the refereed scientific literature. Furthermore, in the past 20 years the science has advanced so we have a much more plausible picture of human ancestory (although I believe that of the chimpanzee and gorilla are still not as well known).",

That theories change with time, or even discarded, as new evidence is uncovered (or old evidence understood) is part of the nature of science.\n\n \n What say you to the arbitrary ways of evolutionaries?\n \n We have\n Darwin and Dawkins with slow change\n To Rapid Saltations, or Stephen Jay Gould's middle of the roade punctuated equillibrium\n \n \n Actually I've discovered even more complexity...\n \"1. Darwinian Evolution: Accumulation of small mutations by natural selection. The pace of evolution may vary from \"slow\" (little change over millions of years) to \"fast\" (substantial change over millions of years), as long as no large step occurs in a single generation.\n 2. Random Saltation: Major changes by large \"jumps\" in a single generation, either by \"borrowing\" genetic material from another organism, frame shifts in the genome, increase in chromosome number, etc. While these changes are very rarely favorable, enough time is available to make them probable.\n 3. \"Anthropic\" Saltation: As in position 2, except that the changes are so rarely favorable that large-scale evolution is unlikely to occur in any one universe. With infinite numbers of possible universes, any universe with observers (like ours) is inevitably one in which these overwhelmingly unlikely events have occurred.\n 4. \"Providential\" Saltation: As in position 3, except that the extremely improbable events in a single universe were foreordained and planned by God, who \"engineered\" them without violating physical laws, either through setting of initial conditions, exploiting of quantum uncertainty, or other, perhaps unknowable, methods.\n 5.
