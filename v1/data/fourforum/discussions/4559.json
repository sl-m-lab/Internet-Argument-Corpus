According to a CRS brief the prospects for long term clean-up are bleak at best.\n \n.\n Long-Term Cleanup. If Congress authorized development, but no commercial quantity of oil were found, the ecosystem is likely to recover substantially from exploratory activities in only a few years. If major quantities of oil and gas were found, development would probably last for decades or perhaps even a century, if natural gas production becomes commercially feasible. Substantial recovery from the much higher level of disturbance might then take further centuries in the harsh Arctic environment and could be a herculean task. Thus, Congress might be debating rehabilitation that would not begin until 2060 or 2090. Furthermore, some types of cleanup might not even be desirable or practical: deep gravel roads and drilling pads, for example, might be impossible to remove without creating further damage, and thus might necessarily become a permanent feature of the landscape. No existing federal laws are known to cover such long terms in planning for a cleanup whose cause may never occur, and the exact nature of which is unknown.\n\n \n Further difficulties could arrive in fault lines. There is a very high risk of an oil spill in Alaska not only because of the weather, but also because it s the most geologically active place on earth! It has literately thousands of earthquakes every year and it has also seen some of the largest earthquakes in recent history. \n \n In addition CRS consistently refers to ANWR saying \"If oil exists there...\" This bipartisan body never actually affirms the existence of oil. \n \n Democrat solution to initial problem; a solution which actually address the heart of the problem! *Personal Disclosure, I worked for senator murray as an intern*\n \n \nSenator Murray:\n \n \"The responsible way to address our energy problems is to focus on the long term solutions like reducing our need for oil, and investing in clean and renewable energy sources. \n The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is an important and unique national treasure. In fact, it's the only conservation system in North America that protects a complete spectrum of arctic ecosystems. It's the most biologically productive part of the Arctic Refuge. And it's a critical calving ground for a large herd of caribou, which are vital to many Native Americans in the Arctic.\"\n \n http://murray.senate.gov/~murray/releases/ \n 02/04/2002417C06.html\n \n \n \n CRS Brief on ANWR, CRS or Congressional Research Service is a bipartisan arm of the congress which gives all the Senators and Members the information that they need to make decisions.

   "Summary\n \n In anticipation of the need for scientific support for policy decisions and in light of the decade-old perspective of a previous assessment, the USGS has completed a reassessment of the petroleum potential of the ANWR 1002 area. This was a comprehensive study by a team of USGS scientists in collaboration on technical issues (but not the assessment) with colleagues in other agencies and universities. The study incorporated all available public data and included new field and analytic work as well as the reevaluation of all previous work. \n \n Using a methodology similar to that used in previous USGS assessments in the ANWR and the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, this study estimates that the total quantity of technically recoverable oil in the 1002 area is 7.7 BBO (mean value), which is distributed among 10 plays. Most of the oil is estimated to occur in the western, undeformed part of the ANWR 1002 area, which is closest to existing infrastructure. Furthermore, the oil is expected to occur in a number of accumulations rather than a single large accumulation. Estimates of economically recoverable oil, expressed by probability curves, show increasing amounts of oil with increasing price. At prices less than $13 per barrel, no commercial oil is estimated, but at a price of $30 per barrel, between 3 and 10.4 billion barrels are estimated. Economic analysis includes the costs of finding, developing, producing, and transporting oil to market based on a 12 percent after-tax return on investment, all calculated in constant 1996 dollars.  \n \n The amounts of in-place oil estimated for the ANWR 1002 area are larger than previous USGS estimates. The increase results in large part from improved resolution of reprocessed seismic data and geologic analogs provided by recent nearby oil discoveries.\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n I'm not sure how today's $56/bbl oil prices compare to $30 in 1996, but it might slightly increase economic reserves.\n \n I also highlighted what IMHO is a VERY important statement at the end of this quote regarding the methodology used to determine reserves in this study. Just ask Husky Energy about banking on the veracity of seismic data in deltaic and offshore oil exploration. You may have beautiful reservoir and perfect seismic models, problem is, there isn't much market for saltwater, and until they're proven with the drill bit, you're a high stakes gambler if you're putting your money down on it. The fact there's other production in the area and a decent understanding of the geology takes out some of the risk, but I speak from experience when I say that you are NEVER sure.\n \n Waxy",

I remember having a discussion with you on FTE about oil. :) \n Without the ability of drilling test holes in ANWR, how credible are the 1998 estimates and are these the latest available data?\n\n \n I'd never claim to be an expert.\n \n The estimates are what would likely be booked as a mix of Exploratory and Probable reserves.\n \n Neither carries a whole lot of weight in terms of gov't or market recognition. Exploratory reserves would be risked at say 5-25% likelihood of existing, probables would fall around 25-75%. In order to be classified as a probable you must have supporting data beyond simple seismic - drill cores, well logs, analog production, etc... IIRC, there is a very limited supply of this data in the ANWR.\n \n Those numbers are just off the top of my head, if you'd like a detailed explanation of how oil companies report reserves, I'd either have to fax it to you, or try to find it on the web. The whole aspect of estimating and reporting reserves is likely the most highly regulated aspect of the oil industry, both internally and through the gov't. The only other aspect that gets that kind of attention is environmental regulation.\n \n To the best of my knowledge, the 1998 data is as current as it gets, but could be wrong. Seismic technology has advance in 8 years, but not significantly enough IMHO to alter the interpretation that was arrived at in 1998.\n \n Predicting reserves from seismic data is risky business. It's done largely on a volumetric basis, simply multiply area X thickness X estimated porosity X a couple other technical factors to arrive at an estimated original oil in place, the OOIP. The OOIP is the mulitplied by a recovery factor, anywhere from 5 to 25%, with 5-10 being standard or arrive at the recoverable oil in place. The number of assumptions and constants required that are in general anything but assumable or constant, makes the numbers pretty shaky.\n \n I referred you to Husky Energy - they claimed huge reserves based on seismic modelling and spent tonnes of $$$$ of the east coast of Canada, in the Sable Island region, on what turned out to be beautifully porous, prolific reservoirs - full of saltwater.\n \n My memory is hazy on this stuff, I took a short course right out of university on the geology of the Mackenzie Delta area, but that was a while ago, and I really haven't looked at it since. At the time, the fellow who was teaching the course was pretty luke warm about the hydrocarbon potential in the basin.\n \n Waxy",

The 6 month figure that anti-ANWR folks like to banter around has been traced back to an episode of West Wing. \n \n \n Unfortunately this is flagrantly false. I asked my old Geology professor about ANWR reserves and she told me this:\n \n There is a 98% odds that there is less than 2 years with of oil.

George cited the Energy Information Administration as his main source. It is a website directly linked with the United States Government. If you ask me, hardly an organization that would be 'hoodwinked' by an episode of the West Wing. In fact, it was probably this website that the West Wing got THEIR figures from!

They make a specific claim: \"oil and caribou are compatible, the legislators said.\"\n \n But CRS says otherwise.\n \n \nOn August 25, 1995, DOI released a Preliminary Review of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska, Coastal Plain Resource Assessment. Examining especially biological impacts, the report concluded \"there would be major environmental impacts from oil and gas development on the coastal plain.\" (The report noted that it joined the earlier 1987 FLEIS in that conclusion.)\n \n \n It also cites a danger to Polar Bears:\n \n \nPolar bears, according to both the 1987 and 1995 reports, are vulnerable to disturbance in their maternity dens.

   "You can skirt the issue all day, but when all the smoke clears, oil is a diminishing resource whose price is destined to be pressured upward by an increasingly industrializing global market competing for the available supply. Simply put, I don't see any long term incentive for producers to lower prices. We have chosen to ignore the oil embargo days that forced us to build fuel efficient vehicles in lei of the 5,000 - 6,000 lb. 4 wheel drives that have become standard equipment in every American driveway. Now, once again, America is caught between a rock and a hard place as domestic automobile manufacturers are marketing 10-16 mpg gas guzzlers with 30 gallon tanks and fuel costs are rising faster than our Middle East war budget. We had the technology to produce high mileage vehicles 25 years ago, but we chose to ignore it. It's hard to feel sorry for a country that isn't smart enough to plan for the inevitable future. Now we've developed a crippling dependence on a product we have a limited ability to produce, and even less ability to price control.

The original oil in place corresponding to this recovery is at least 15.6 billion barrels. EIA scheduled daily production rates for postulated yearly development rates of 250 and 400 million barrels per year. The production rate peaks at 650,000 barrels per day for the development of 250 million barrels per year and at 800,000 barrels per day for the 400 million barrels per year development case. (Figure 3)\n \n Mean Case\n \n The USGS estimates that the mean or expected value of the technically recoverable oil is 10.3 billion barrels from the ANWR Coastal Plain of the Alaska North Slope. The original oil in place corresponding to this recovery is 27.8 billion barrels. EIA scheduled production rates are for postulated development rates of 400 and 600 million barrels per year. The production rate peaks at 1.0 million barrels per day for the development of 400 million barrels per year case and at 1.35 million barrels per day for the 600 million barrels per year development case. (Figure 4)\n \n 5 Percent Probability Case\n The USGS estimates that there is a 5 percent probability (a 1 in 20 chance) that 16.0 billion barrels of oil, or more, may be technically recoverable from the ANWR Coastal Plain of the Alaska North Slope. The original oil in place corresponding to this recovery is at least 42.3 billion barrels.\n EIA scheduled production rates for postulated development rates of 600 and 800 million barrels per year. The production rate peaks at 1.55 million barrels per day for the development of 600 million barrels per year case and at 1.90 million barrels per day for the 800 million barrels per year development case. (Figure 5)\n .......\n The USGS economic analysis of the ANWR 1002 Area calculates that once oil has been discovered, more than 80 percent of the technically recoverable oil is commercially developable at an oil price of $25 per barrel. In general, it is assumed that production from Alaska (including ANWR) would reduce oil imports by an equal amount. The imported refiner acquisition cost in 2020 is projected in EIA's Annual Energy Outlook 2000 reference case to be $22.04 (1998 dollars). At this price, the potential ANWR oil recovered would have a value between $125 and $350 billion (in 1998 dollars.)\n http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/oil_gas/petroleum/analysis_publications/arctic_national_wildlife_refuge/html/analysisdiscussion.html\n \n\n It has been projected that oil will hit $100/barrel in the next decade. That brings ANWR's value to $600Billion - $1.6Trillion. At that value, we could charter jets to take the caribou and polar bears anywhere they wanted to go. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \n\n I implore you to think more closely about what you are writing before you post and to check your sources more closely.

This probably has never been a real goal of our government since a large part of the price of every gallon of gas is made up of various taxes.

Politicians broke the trust in 1956, shifting revenue to the highway trust fund, the granddaddy of all pork barrels that allowed them to allocate those funds by committee to buy political support in their respective states. \n \n jskufan is correct in stating that increases in that tax revenue stream are encouraged as it happens to be the single most powerful political tool in congress in that politicians can spend it to achieve and maintain power with virtually no public accountability based on the committee seniority spoils system.\n \n And let's not forget profits currently being reaped on excess US oil consumption by our import requirements. Exxon-Mobil is the largest US corporation in terms of profit and return on capital. Or Halliburton. \n \n Actually no entity, private or government, has any interest in reducing US oil consumption. Government has crafted taxation systems that keep consumer visible costs per gallon low to pacify those consumers. Associated vehicle costs, licensing fee structures, commercial fuel taxes (anyone notice the jump in diesel prices?), inspections, etc. are taxed separately to keep 'pump' prices from disturbing consumer complacency.\n \n The last report I read (GM) stated that pump prices would remain low enough through 2006 to facilitate continued marketing of full-sized SUVs and light trucks with their relatively poor fuel efficiency. Those two model lines contribute the lions share of profits to all domestic manufacturers, exceeded only by their finance subsidiaries. As pump prices will undoubtedly take a big jump this summer and fall, driven by China's requirements and our ME policy straining production capibilty, that may be a big factor in GM slashing 2005 profit forecasts. \n \n Anyone who believes the political red herring of drop-in-the-bucket increased Alaskan production will lower pump prices or reduce oil imports needs to talk to Eddie, who is putting the London Bridge on the market, or any number of people selling Arizona oceanfront property.",

It is energy intensive.\n \n Personally, I would like to see more biomass gasification. It is an off the shelf technology that we have been using since WWII. While it is impractivcal on a large scale (due to the cost of transporting relatively large amounts of bulks feedstock), there are a LOT of commercial applications that produce a biomass waste stream where the system could be benificial. Examples include pretty much and fruit or nut industry, the cotton industry, most agricultural industries in general, lumber industry, etc....\n \n The problem is that to make biomass gasification viable, producers would have to be allowed to feed into the grid, and paid for their excess production.
