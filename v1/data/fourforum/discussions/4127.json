We in the west (at least my part of the west) prefer not to take responsibility for anything.\n \n If you are talking about taking responsibility for the deaths, you have to be joking. We don't take responsibility for our own troops dying, or Iraqi civilian casualties that we are directly responsible for. Unless ever Kirghiz is brought over and executed on pennsylvania avenue, in front of reporters, it would be surprising if the people of the US even know it is going on. \n \n Lets do a little poll. Before today, how many Americans knew what a Kirghiz was, or where you would be likely to find one?\n \n IF it isn't on Fox, it didn't happen.",

   "Hello ati. emoticon_xbye Welcome aboard.It seems we are damned if we help,and damned if we don't .I don't know whats going on, and I don't care to know.\n I think a lot of us are tired of the U.S. sticking their nose where it doesn't belong.Our resources for helping anyone is stretched so thin,about all we could do is send a get well card.\n You didn't mention where you are from,so I'm not sure if this accusation is founded or not.\n If this revolution is successful,we must of helped somewhere .If it turns into a bloodbath,we'll deny even knowing anyone or talking to anyone.\n Does this event affect you personally,or is this just an observation of events?",

   "As a neighbor of China, you need not be concerned about US intervention of any type. It took the US two wars and 30-years to comprehend that China isn't intimidated by any power who attempts massing troops on their borders. \n \n Our intervention formula is actually quite simple. The US selects third-tier nations with limited military capability, no allies and desirable natural resources to display our military might. That way a swift military victory is assured with politically acceptable low US casualties and we can declare any resistance the work of terrorists from other countries. \n \n As to responsibility, you must understand that anyone who doesn't speak our definition of the English language in one of the regional dialects we pride ourselves on is considered 'foreign'. We're somewhat petty about that. Our nearest neighbors, Canada and Mexico, are continually subjected to politically motivated trade tariffs for not supporting our somewhat bloody crusader efforts to implement our Christian system of ideology in smaller, foreign nations. We also attempt closing our borders to citizens of Mexico who desire relocating here to work at jobs shunned by Americans. \n \n About the best I can do is wish good luck to you and your country.",
