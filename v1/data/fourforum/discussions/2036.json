   "Just thought this would generate an interesting debate.\n \n \n Here's a letter written by an American voter to George Bush. \n \n Dear President Bush: \n \n Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God's Law. I have\n learned a great deal from you, and try to share that knowledge with as many\n people as I can. When someone tries to defend the homosexual lifestyle, for\n example, I simply remind them that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be\n an abomination... End of debate. \n \n I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some other elements of\n God's Laws and how to follow them. \n \n 1) Leviticus 25:44 states that I may possess slaves, both male and\n female, provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of\n mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians. Can you\n clarify? Why can't I own Canadians? \n \n 2) I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in Exodus\n 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her? \n \n 3) I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her\n period of menstrual uncleanliness -Lev.15: 19-24. The problem is how do I\n tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense. \n \n 4) When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a\n pleasing odor for the Lord - Lev.1:9. The problem is my neighbors. They\n claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them? \n \n 5) I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2\n clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him\n myself, or should I ask the police to do it? \n \n 6) A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an\n abomination - Lev. 11:10, it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I\n don't agree. Can you settle this? Are there 'degrees' of abomination? \n \n 7) Lev. 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a\n defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my\n vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle-room here? \n \n 8) Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair\n around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev. \n 19:27. How should they die? \n \n 9) I know from Lev. 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me\n unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves? \n \n 10) My uncle has a farm. He violates Lev. 19:19 by planting two different\n crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two\n different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). He also tends to curse\n and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble\n of getting the whole town together to stone them? - Lev. 24:10-16. Couldn't\n we just burn them to death at a private family affair, as we do with people\n who sleep with their in-laws? (Lev. 20:14). \n \n 11) Exodus 19 says that it's better to give your young daughters to a\n crowd of lusting men, rather than allowing the crowd to have its way with\n your male houseguests. Would you do that with your daughters? Should I do\n it with mine the next time I have friends over? \n \n \n I know you have studied these things extensively and thus enjoy considerable\n expertise in such matters, so I am confident you can help. Thank you again\n for reminding us that the Bible is the literal word of God and that God's\n word is eternal and unchanging. \n \n Sincerely, A FAITHFUL VOTER ",
