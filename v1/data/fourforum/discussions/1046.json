   "Tony Martin Support Group\n \n \n A scary vision of the violaters of your civil rights world of the future AS IT EXISTS TODAY IN THE UK!:\n \n \"LONG WALK TO FREEDOM\n \n THOUGHT POLICE PREVENT HOME VISIT\n \n AND YOUR TAXES FUND COMPENSATION CLAIM\n \n Political prisoner Tony Martin has been released at last after more than three years inside for the crime of self defence. The Criminal Justice system managed to delay his release again, on the grounds of the risk he posed to members of Britain's burgling community as they went about their daily labours. Showing great moral courage, Mr Martin again refused to show the required degree of repentance which could have earned him a release last year. But our Probation 'Service' would rather Mr Martin had not defended himself, but become a victim like this. Or this. Or this. Or this. You get the picture.\n \n One of the three criminals who targeted Tony Martin has been granted legal aid to sue him for 'loss of earnings'. The poor man has since been scraping a living dealing heroin to keep body and soul together - altogether a most worthy recipient of taxpayers money. And in a last vindictive gesture by the authorities, he was released the Friday before Tony Martin. A professional criminal who has never had a job in his life - and the Probation Service is happy he'll go straight - two thirds off his sentence. A law-abiding citizen who only ever wanted to live in peace on his farm only gets half the remission. \n \n Richard Littlejohn is right - you couldn't make it up. \n \n The campaign goes on. Martin's MP Henry Bellingham wants legal changes to ensure burglars leave the bulk of their 'rights' outside a house when they break in. But only thousands of letters and faxes will sway the minds of our politicians and get a full review of Mr Martin's case. Use the 'Fax Your MP' link to let them know what you think. Be polite, and only fax YOUR Member of Parliament.\n \n \n BUT GUILTY OF SELF DEFENCE AND THOUGHT CRIME\n \n Tony Martin was refused parole for the second time on 16th January 2003, apparently on the grounds of thinking the wrong thoughts. He became eligible for parole in October 2002. But one of the conditions of parole is that you show remorse and swear never to offend again (you may gauge their sincerity and the Parole Board's gullibility by the reoffending rates). The average criminal will gladly say whatever's required in exchange for a few years off.\n \n But Mr Martin is not a criminal. He is an innocent man. He is also an honest man, incapable of the kind of lies that would mean a quick exit from prison. It has also been reported that social workers considered his opinion that 'things were better forty years ago' as evidence that he was 'not living in the 21st century' and so should not be released. It appears that holding such opinions can be dangerous to your liberty.\n \n So Tony Martin, whose only crime is defending himself in his own home, is still branded a killer and is approaching the start of his third year in prison. The Court of Appeal under Lord Justice Woolf turned down his appeal against his conviction, rejecting the claim of self-defence. In January 2002 Lord Justice Bingham refused him leave to appeal to the House of Lords.... \"\n \n READ ON!\n \n The canary in the UK cage is dead!",
