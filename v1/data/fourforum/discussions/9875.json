Those of us who espouse a pro-life philosophy believe that innocent life, regardless of the stage of development is precious in the sight of God.\n\n Both of you treat the unborn child as if it has a mental existence in that you empathize with it, talk about it as being innocent, etc. For late term fetuses, you might well be right but you must remember that by far the great majority of abortions are performed in the first trimester, when there is no mental existence - no thoughts, emotions, fear, pain, sense of self, etc - none at ALL. There is nobody home - just an empty body, an empty shell waiting to be filled. How can an empty body be called innocent or inspire empathy in you? Who exactly is it that you think you are empathizing with? Empathy means that you are imagining the suffering, feelings, or experiences of the being in question. If the being has no suffering, feelings, or experiences, then your empathy is based purely on imagination.\n \n As for aborting due to Downs syndrome, if it is done after roughly the beginning of the third trimester (where there could be \"somebody home\" in that body), then I would agree that there would be some heartlessness to that decisions. However, prior to that time, you are not hurting anyone with abortion - no one will suffer, there is no \"somebody\" who will be lost - just a body with potential for more.\n \n I'll ask you the same question I asked other pro-life people. Namely, what SPECIFICALLY in the zygote or early embryo do you find so precious? Saying \"it is human\" is not enough. Give details if you want to be convincing.",

HOW? And why did it start?? Who were the first 2 people to never have a belly button (a sign to all humanity that it started with 2 people)\n \n anyways.. just something to think upon..\n\n I agree with you that one cannot pick an arbitrary point of development to call significant enough for rights. However, we disagree as to which points of development are justifiable as being significant enough for rights and which are arbitrary. We each say that the other's choice of development stage is arbitrary. You say that one needs to assign rights at our beginning but how does one define that beginning? \n \n I, and many others, view that we came into existence at the beginning of our mental existence, which starts around the beginning of the third trimester of pregnancy. If I had been aborted before that time, nobody would have been hurt since there was \"nobody home\" in that embryo which eventually became me. Similarly, once our bodies deteriorate to the point that they no longer contain any mental existence, then we can be said to be dead. That is also the religious / philosophical notion behind the idea of the soul. Again, as I have said many times in many threads, it is not the DEGREE of that mental development that I think determines our beginnings, but ANY mental existence at all (so people with Alzheimers, people who are sleeping, in coma, third trimester fetuses, etc. are all mentally existing or at least have a possibility of currently mentally existing and all deserve rights). I simply don't see a body alone without any mind as being a \"someone\". I've seen a few bodies of loved ones who have died. Even if those bodies had been sustained alive artificially, it would have been clear that the loved one was long gone and all we were looking at was an empty shell. Both at the beginning of life and at its end, the body is just a shell if there is no mental existence. I don't think it is relevant to assign rights to such shells or empty living containers.\n \n You seem to think it is the beginning of our physical existence that is the crutual point, independent of whether or not we exist mentally. However, even if you hold that view, then what physical changes really happen at conception? After all, the ova and sperm that unite to form us are also alive and human. The main changes I see are:\n 1) Two half sets of human DNA combine to form a complete set\n 2) The growth process starts\n \n I just don't see either of those developments as significant enough to grant the living entity a right to life and take away a woman's right over her own body. The second development - i.e. the growth process starting - does make it far more probable that the ensuing embryo will develop into a full human with rights. Many people, perhaps you included, find that POTENTIAL to be so critically important that it overrules nearly everything. I, myself, do place value in that potential of the zygote / embryo to become a valued person but not so much as I value a woman's right to her body.\n \n Is it the potential inherent in that zygote which you most value or is it something specific about what the zygote is AT THAT MOMENT?",

I think that most on the pro-choice side trust the results of science in determining the stages of development of the fetus - including when it gains a mental existence (religion may or may not play a role but only in other realms). \n \n Do you have any arguements to add to those in order to try to convince others of why early fetuses should have a right to life?\n\n \n The reason behind my argument is that I oppose the intervention of people to effect the prevention of what would be life. Life is precious to each of us who are allowed to experience it. ie: victims of persecution such as Dachau. Life, and the will to survive is so powerful that these people struggled for life enduring the agony of hunger and mental humiliation for every moment they could squeeze out of life. \n What you have labeled as a \"zygote\" may well be a zygote. It is not capable of telling us that it wants to live. But, if we do not interfere with it's process, it will live. And in my mind, it is our duty to promote and nurture life. \n \n 1. I too value the right of women to decide. But, in the process of deciding, it needs to be understood that more than one body is effected by the decision. \n One, may not survive. \n 2. This statement is basically a statement that the knowledge that science provides for us empowers us to assume the right to choose who or what, gets the opporitunity to experience life. And we do have that power, but, choosing to give each zygote it's chance at life is my preference and mankind putting greater effort into solving the problems that ail society becoming the focus of the talented people who adeptly argue for the right of women to eliminate what could be the love of their life.",

   "Not at all Simone, women, in this humble opinion are held in the highest esteem and respected. Women have been the great purveyors of ethics and common sense to the offspring of mankind. Women, have always held the power that matters in life. They are the ones who children learn their most important lessons from, they are the great factor in personality development. \n It is not my opinion that women are soley responsible for the end results of abortion. Men, do not get a pass from these responsibilities. Too long have young men been able to walk away from a situation and not look back. Assuming for himself \"innocence\". \n Not presuming to be able to blanketly state reasons ladies make the decision to go through an abortion. It is surely a torturous process made more painful by having to decide and face alone. I do not consider religion in my condemnation of the practice. The reasons presented in favor of abortion have been many. The possible hardships faced in life based on conditions the momma lives in. Life is hard. But, if life was not valued by it's vessel, suicide would be a much more common event. The absence of reverence for life would not be protected by laws against murder as it would not be of importance to each of us. To deny what would become life it's opporitunity at life is wrong. \n My crusade has nothing to do with chauvanism. Nor driven by disrespect for women and their rights.

At least be intellectually honest enough to not couch the position in pleasant sounding rhetoric.\n\n It is honest.

In each country where we believed data would be available, we requested information and published reports containing abortion statistics from the national statistical office or a local informed expert. (The experts were government officials, scientists interested in abortion and family planning officials.) For most countries, we sent a questionnaire requesting specific abortion, birth and population data.\n .....\n Countries with Highly Restrictive Laws\n Official statistics on illegal abortions are usually not available for countries with restrictive laws. For regional and worldwide estimates, we used WHO's estimates of the number of abortions occurring in areas where abortion is highly restricted, and of the number of unsafe abortions occurring in areas where abortion is legally permitted but where significant numbers are performed under illegal conditions.16 These estimates are based on \"indirect\" techniques and take into account a variety of existing information on abortion, including studies reporting the ratio of births to abortion complications treated in hospitals, information on access to clandestine abortion services from trained physicians, the likelihood that women having abortions will experience complications, the degree of access to hospital treatment and the level of urbanization.\n \n These techniques use information obtained from a number of sources: official statistics on women hospitalized for the treatment of abortion complications; hospital studies; surveys of medical facilities; and surveys of providers, women or abortion patients. Each of these sources suffers from some inadequacy, and adjustments and assumptions are necessary to allow for these data limitations. \n .....\n http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/25s3099.html\n \n\n You really should read it, so that you can debate from an informed position. :)",

A divorce rate of 50% with a marriage rate of 70% of couples or a divoirce rate of 40% with a marriage rate of 20%? I'd rather have door #1, personally.

   "Both of you treat the unborn child as if it has a mental existence in that you empathize with it, talk about it as being innocent, etc. For late term fetuses, you might well be right but you must remember that by far the great majority of abortions are performed in the first trimester, when there is no mental existence - no thoughts, emotions, fear, pain, sense of self, etc - none at ALL. There is nobody home - just an empty body, an empty shell waiting to be filled. How can an empty body be called innocent or inspire empathy in you? Who exactly is it that you think you are empathizing with? Empathy means that you are imagining the suffering, feelings, or experiences of the being in question. If the being has no suffering, feelings, or experiences, then your empathy is based purely on imagination.\n \n As for aborting due to Downs syndrome, if it is done after roughly the beginning of the third trimester (where there could be \"somebody home\" in that body), then I would agree that there would be some heartlessness to that decisions. However, prior to that time, you are not hurting anyone with abortion - no one will suffer, there is no \"somebody\" who will be lost - just a body with potential for more.\n \n I'll ask you the same question I asked other pro-life people.

Fortunately, your and my Mom's agreed with me.\n\n I do not use the term \"zygote\" instead of \"baby\" because of any guilt. I use that term because it makes no sense to call a zygote a baby. I find it important to differentiate between reality and imagination. It seems that you use the term baby for anything that most likely will become a baby. You make no differentiation between what IS and what WILL BE. That makes no sense to most of us on the pro-choice side. \n \n Even though it might not be officially correct, I, personally, might start using the term \"baby\" once the fetus gains mental existence since then what it is AT THAT MOMENT is already important - a human life with a mental, not just physical, existence.\n \n Also, you keep assuming that we have a sense of guilt about advocating abortion rights. That is just your imagination working again. It is logic which drives our terminology, not any imagined sense of guilt. My stance on abortion rights is based on my convinctions which, in turn, are based on a combination of reason and a sense of empathy.

It is a matter of allowing for flexibility in terms in personal situations, where accuracy isn't as important as a matter of principle, compared to situations of debate or decision where it is important that terms have specific meanings if conversation is to be effective. As long as people can differentiate between casual and official use of language, I don't see much harm.

I often wonder if and when the baby who was destined to discover the cure for cancer or the other most lethal diseases which afflict humanity was aborted. And how many lives would have ultimately been saved, had that one single child been allowed to live. Good post, and thanks for sharing...",

   "Here are some more facts for you to consider holly.\n  Life, Lies and Hard Cases 1/18/2003\n Countering pro-abortion arguments with truth.\n \n Countering pro-abortion arguments with truth.\n \n Since the U.S. Supreme Court handed down its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, abortion supporters have refined their ability to distract from the truth. From the beginning, ideological spin doctors created arguments of fact and fiction to fuel the fiery conflict. How much of today\u00eds abortion rhetoric is rooted in fact, and how much in fiction?\n \n Defining Life\n \n For years the crux of the abortion debate centered on the question of life\u00eds beginning. In the early years of the Roe era, abortion advocates had an easier time portraying the unborn child as nothing more than a glob of tissue. But advances in ultrasound technology opened a window to the womb, shattering this myth as mothers viewed their developing baby at early stages in pregnancy. In fact, it was this very same ultrasound technology that persuaded Dr. Bernard Nathanson, former abortionist and founder of National Association for Repeal of Abortion Laws\u00f3now known as National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League Pro-Choice America (NARAL Pro-Choice America), to become pro-life. Dr. Nathanson says that ultrasound and fetal heart monitoring led him to acknowledge that the fetus was \u00eca member of the human community.\u00ee\n \n WHEN DOES LIFE BEGIN?\n \n \u00ecIf we don\u00edt know, then shouldn\u00edt we opt on the side that is life? If you came upon an immobile body and you yourself could not determine whether it was dead or alive, I think that you would decide to consider it alive until someone could prove it was dead. You wouldn\u00edt get a shovel and start covering it up. And I think we should do the same thing with regard to abortion.\u00ee\n \n President Ronald Reagan\n \n Technology also allowed color photographs to be taken of the growing child\u00f3pictures so clear that viewers could count the fingers on the tiny hand. Such technology removed all doubt that the unborn child is indeed human life.\n \n Still abortion advocates insisted that a fetus is only a part of the mother\u00eds body. And a woman has the right to do what she wishes with her own body. But even if we accept this misguided line of reasoning, modern technology forces us to acknowledge truth.\n \n Justice Sandra Day O\u00edConnor, referring to Roe v. Wade, remarked that the Supreme Court\u00eds decision on abortion put it \u00econ a collision course with itself.\u00ee She realized that high-tech medicine \u00eccontinues to improve the chance for immature fetuses to survive outside the womb. That strengthens the appeal of arguments that \u00d6 abortions are the taking of viable life.\u00ee\n \n Moreover, viability is not an intellectually honest test for life. Biology considers the fertilized egg of any animal as a living organism distinct from its mother. The embryo is an entirely separate life with its own heartbeat and DNA, not merely a part of a woman\u00eds body. Additionally, arguing that if the fetus cannot survive on his own, then he is not human, is faulty. Applying that same argument to a person dependent on any outside source for survival\u00f3for example, kidney dialysis\u00f3is absurd.\n \n \u00ecFrom molecular genetics to comparative reproduction, nature has taught us that\n \n form [the unborn child], from its very beginning\u00f3the \u00ebthing\u00ed we started with\u00f3is a member of our kin,\u00ee argues the late Dr. Jerome Lejeune, professor of Fundamental Genetics at the Universite Rene Descartes in Paris. \u00ecBeing its own, human by its nature, never a tumor, never an amoebae, fish or quadruped, it is the same human being from fecundation [conception] to death.\u00ee Clearly, there is no scientific basis for abortion advocates\u00ed claim that life begins only when it can survive outside the womb. In fact, entire fields of science and research\u00f3such as genetics and reproductive technology\u00f3thrive precisely because life begins at conception. Therefore, an unborn child should be legally protected from the point of conception.\n \n Medical science clearly shows that life begins at conception.\n \n Consider the following:\n \n &#8721; At 18 days of gestation, the baby\u00eds heart begins occasional pulsation.\n \n &#8721; At 20 days, the foundation for the entire nervous system exists.\n \n &#8721; At 21 days, the heart begins to beat regularly and pumps through the circulatory system.\n \n &#8721; At 30 days, the eyes, ears, mouth, kidneys and liver exist.\n \n &#8721; At 42 days, brain waves are reliably present and reflexes exist.\n \n &#8721; At 45 days, teeth buds are present; skeleton is complete; movement begins.\n \n &#8721; At 56 days, all body systems are present; he reacts to pain.\n \n &#8721; At 9-10 weeks, he squints, retracts his tongue, and will bend his fingers around an object.\n \n &#8721; At 11-12 weeks, all body systems work; his arms and legs move; he swallows, sucks thumb, inhales and exhales amniotic fluid, and has fingernails.\n \n &#8721; At 14 weeks, the auditory sense is present.\n \n &#8721; At 16 weeks, eyelashes are present; he can grasp, swim, kick and turn.\n \n &#8721; At 18 weeks, his vocal cords work; he can cry.\n \n &#8721; At 20 weeks, hair appears; he weighs about one pound and is about 12 inches long.\n \n A History of Lies\n \n Roe v. Wade, which gave America abortion-on-demand, was a decision built on a foundation of lies. Norma McCorvey was \u00ecJane Roe\u00ee\u00f3the plaintiff who, under the direction of\n \n the abortion lobby, claimed that she had been a victim of gang rape. She has since admitted that this was an outright lie. Nevertheless, the ruling stands.\n \n Now a pro-life activist, Norma McCorvey says, \u00ecI was the most willing dupe [of abortion advocates].\u00ee Testifying before a Senate panel, she confessed, \u00ecI think it\u00eds safe to say that the entire abortion industry is based on a lie \u00d6 I am dedicated to spending the rest of my life undoing the law that bears my name \u00d6 I had to face up to the awful reality. Abortion was not about \u00ebproducts of conception\u00ed [or] \u00ebmissed periods.\u00ed It was about children being killed in their mothers\u00ed wombs. All those years, I was wrong.\u00ee\n \n While Roe v. Wade is the most widely known abortion case in America, the U.S. Supreme Court issued another crucial ruling as a companion case to Roe, which further defined the terms of abortion in America. The second case is known as Doe v. Bolton. Sandra Cano was the plaintiff \u00ecDoe\u00ee in this case. Today, she testifies of how she was exploited at the hands of abortion advocates.\n \n \u00ecI was poor, pregnant, uneducated, seeking assistance and getting a divorce from a man who was a convicted child molester. My only source of help was Atlanta Legal Aid. Instead of the help I sought, a feminist attorney turned my circumstances into a tool to achieve her agenda\u00f3legalizing abortion,\u00ee Cano said, speaking at a pro-life march. \u00ecFor over 20 years now, my name has been synonymous with abortion. I was against abortion then. I am against abortion now. I never sought an abortion. I have never had an abortion. Abortion is murder.\u00ee\n \n Not only were the foundational court cases a fraud, the abortion lobby\u00eds fundamental arguments for abortion rights were a farce from the beginning. Abortion advocates found that they could win popular support as well as judicial sympathy by focusing on the horrors of illegal \u00ecback-alley\u00ee abortions. They argued that countless women were dying at the hands of \u00ecback-alley butchers\u00ee who exploited desperate women in crisis pregnancies, and they found that exaggerating the statistics would further their cause.\n \n In Aborting America, Dr. Bernard Nathanson admits:\n \n In NARAL, we generally emphasized the drama of the individual case, not the mass statistics, but when we spoke of the latter, it was always \u00ec5,000 to 10,000 deaths a year.\u00ee I confess that I knew the figures were totally false, and I suppose that the others did too if they stopped to think of it. But in the \u00ecmorality\u00ee of our revolution, it was a useful figure, widely accepted, so why go out of our way to correct it with honest statistics?\n \n The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reports only 39 deaths as a result of abortion in 1972. Nathanson believes that the actual total, allowing for under-reporting, was no more than 500. While any death is a tragedy, the estimated 500 is a far cry from the so-called \u00ecepidemic\u00ee of deaths from back-alley abortions that fueled America\u00eds acceptance of the procedure.\n \n Moreover, by granting abortion its stamp of approval, the Court did not suddenly make the practice a carefree exercise of feminist rights. Abortion is still not safe. Women who have received legal abortions have ended up physically damaged and sometimes dead because the political atmosphere in our nation has made the industry a very lucrative and largely unregulated enterprise\u00f3a dangerous combination for American women.\n \n Dr. Slava V. Gaufberg, research director at Harvard University Medical School, noted that the rate of complications in second-trimester abortions is \u00ecup to 50 percent and higher.\u00ee But tracking those complications is tricky.\n \n One problem that skews statistics on abortion complications is that paperwork reflects only complications occurring at the time of the abortion.\n \n In an effort to gather accurate statistics on abortion complications in Virginia, state Delegate Robert Marshall (R-Manassas) surveyed 1,087 obstetricians and emergency room physicians in 1990. Only 75 responded. But even this low response rate documented 230 abortion complications in Virginia in 1989. More than half (127) were reported 24 hours or more after the abortion. In these instances, the abortion doctor didn\u00edt report an immediate complication. But an emergency room physician or personal doctor was left to try to fix the problem\u00f3circumstances in which the complications aren\u00edt reported as abortion-related.\n \n And women today still die from the procedure. The CDC states that in 1997, seven women reportedly died as the result of abortion. But the CDC admits that, due to under-reporting, its calculations are likely low.\n \n Other facts bear this out. Between 1981 and 1984, the CDC reports 42 women died from abortion. However, former Commissioner of Health for New York City, Dr. Stephen Joseph, stated in a 1987 memo to doctors that during that same period 176 women died as the result of abortion in the United States\u00f330 in New York alone.\n \n And poor women often become vulnerable prey to abortionists out to make a buck. Clinics that cater to the poor are particularly prone to bad conditions, because the poor and minorities are least likely to report problems, admits Dr. Albert Brown, an abortionist who was once reprimanded for an incomplete abortion. \u00ec[Latino women] are some of the best patients,\u00ee he told The Los Angeles Times. \u00ecThey come in and they don\u00edt complain. Sometimes they are given abortions when they are not even pregnant \u00d6 It\u00eds an unregulated industry.\u00ee\n \n Abortion advocates have tried to make abortion acceptable by misrepresenting those who oppose abortion. For example, the National Abortion Federation (NAF) advertisement says, \u00ecWomen who\u00edve had an abortion endure all kinds of name calling, much of which is unprintable here. But the belief that there\u00eds a certain \u00ebtype\u00ed of woman who chooses abortion is as outdated as it is ignorant.\u00ee The fact is pro-life individuals do not condemn women in crisis pregnancies or those who have endured abortion. Sympathizing with their difficult situation, pro-lifers support medical innovation and ministries that aid women in crisis pregnancies. And they show compassion toward post-abortive women. For example, Sydna Mass\u00c8, founder of the post-abortion ministry Ramah International, uses her own abortion experience to reach out to women in need.\n \n Abortion advocates manipulate opinion polls to feign majority support for abortion-on-demand. \u00ecIf a question about abortion contains the phrase \u00ebterminate pregnancy\u00ed or \u00ebwomen\u00eds right to \u00d6\u00ed or the words \u00ebdoctor, choice, the embryo, the fetus,\u00ed the answer of the majority will be pro-abortion. If the question uses the words \u00ebabortion for social or economic reasons\u00ed or \u00ebthe unborn or pre-born baby,\u00ed \u00ebhis or her\u00ed (rather than \u00ebits\u00ed), \u00ebabortionist,\u00ed \u00d6 the answer of the majority will be pro-life.\u00ee\n \n \u00ecThe Supreme Court brought great discredit on itself by overturning state laws regulating abortion without any persuasive basis in constitutional text or logic. And to make matters worse, it committed these grave errors in the service of an extreme vision of abortion rights that the vast majority of Americans rightly consider unjust and immoral.\u00ee\n \n Michael McConnell, professor of constitutional law, University of Utah.\n \n Moreover, while NAF insists that by age 45, nearly half (43 percent) of American women will have had an abortion \u00f3attempting to portray the procedure as a normal occurrence\u00f3abortion declined significantly in the 1990s. Former Education Secretary William Bennett, co-director of Empower America, stated in the 1999 Index of Leading Cultural Indicators that \u00ecthere were at least 208,000 fewer abortions per year toward the end of the decade than at the beginning.\u00ee Even the liberal Center for Gender Equality found that 70 percent of women favor more restrictions on abortion, including 40 percent who believe it should only be allowed in cases of rape, incest or to save the mother\u00eds life.\n \n Abortion advocates, however, continue to spin fiction to advance their agenda. This trend of exaggeration and deceit shows up in debates over partial-birth abortion. Advocates have claimed that partial-birth abortions are performed only when the baby\u00eds or the mother\u00eds life is at risk. Actually 80 percent of these babies are normal; most are viable; and \u00econly 9.4 percent of late-term abortions are to protect the woman\u00eds life or because of fetal defects.\u00ee In fact, Ron Fitzsimmons, executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers, admitted that he \u00eclied through his teeth\u00ee when he falsely claimed the procedure was uncommon and used only in the most extreme situations. He admitted that partial-birth abortion is almost always performed on healthy mothers with healthy babies.\n \n Outright deceit is interwoven into the abortion lobby\u00eds rhetoric; the depth and magnitude are staggering. But perhaps the most tragic lie is that a woman facing an unplanned pregnancy has no alternative to abortion. Abortion proponents are not eager to mention that life can indeed be a beautiful choice. Children bless their parents\u00ed lives, and adoption gives children to the childless and a loving home to a very wanted child.\n \n Constitutionally Illegitimate\n \n Feminists often tout rhetoric about a woman\u00eds \u00ecconstitutional right\u00ee to abortion. But is Roe v. Wade consistent with the U.S. Constitution?\n \n Constitutional scholars\u00f3including those who are pro-abortion\u00f3have a hard time taking Roe v. Wade seriously. Abortion supporter John Hart Ely, former dean of Stanford Law School, admits that the Roe decision \u00ecis not constitutional law.\u00ee\n \n The Court reasoned: A \u00ecright to privacy\u00ee exists in the Constitution, therefore, this right is broad enough to \u00ecencompass a woman\u00eds decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.\u00ee But nowhere does the Constitution mention a \u00ecright to privacy.\u00ee Rather, those who wish to advance the pro-abortion agenda have extrapolated the concept from unrelated amendments.\n \n \u00ecWith Americans believing so dearly in a right to be left alone, it may surprise many people that the Constitution does not include the word \u00ebprivacy\u00ed and offers no explicit mention of it,\u00ee wrote Joan Biskupic, a columnist who covers the U.S. Supreme Court for The Washington Post. \u00ecWhen Justice Harry A. Blackmun, the author of Roe, invoked such a right to strike down laws banning abortion, he was relying on no specific wording in the Bill of Rights or in any previous court decision.\u00ee\n \n In addition to creating this new term, the Court avoided defining it. Furthermore, one would suppose that if a \u00ecright to privacy\u00ee did exist, it would apply only to activities that affect no one else. Yet abortion affects the baby\u00f3an unwilling third party\u00f3which brings us back to the Court\u00eds inability to tackle the controversial issue of defining the beginning of \u00eclife,\u00ee the point at which the baby\u00eds personhood is established.\n \n Michael McConnell, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Utah, writes:\n \n The court can deny such protection to fetuses only if it presupposes they are not persons \u00d6 One can make a pretty convincing argument, however, that fetuses are persons. They are alive; their species is Homo sapiens. They are not simply an appendage of the mother; they have a separate and unique chromosomal structure. Surely, before beings with all the biological characteristics of humans are stripped of their rights as \u00ecpersons\u00ee under the law, we are entitled to an explanation of why they fall short. For the court to say it cannot \u00ecresolve the difficult question of when life begins\u00ee is not an explanation.\n \n Additionally, Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O\u00edConnor writes, \u00ecPotential life is no less potential in the first weeks of pregnancy than it is at viability or afterwards \u00d6 I believe that the state\u00eds interest in protecting potential human life exists throughout the pregnancy [emphasis added].\u00ee\n \n The Hard Cases\n \n The hard cases\u00ee have become an abortion rights rallying point. Abortion advocates point to the tragedy of rape or incest and ask, \u00ecWhy should these women be forced to suffer through a nine-month pregnancy after they have already endured such abuse?\u00ee But rape and incest cases are not typical situations of women seeking abortion. Pregnancies resulting from rape are extremely rare: only .06 of 1 percent of all pregnancies. To justify more than 1.2 million abortions a year on the basis of the relatively few pregnancies resulting from rape would be ludicrous.\n \n Still, for those few women who do find themselves in this tragic situation, abortion is not a compassionate alternative. The child of rape is no less a human being than the child of a loving marriage. And it is certainly unjust to put a child to death for the sins of the father.\n \n Moreover, research indicates that such abortions enhance the physical and emotional turmoil of the woman rather than relieve it. In fact, the only major study of pregnant rape victims, conducted by Dr. Sandra Mahkorn, revealed that 75 to 85 percent chose against abortion. Women in these situations need the compassionate support of churches, friends and family to help them begin to heal.\n \n HARD CASES:\n \n Statistically Negligible percentages of abortions due to rape, incest, cases which involve the deformity of the child or endanger the life of the mother:\n \n RAPE: .06%\n \n INCEST: 1%\n \n DEFORMITY: 2-4%\n \n THREAT TO MOTHER\u00edS LIFE: .06-1%\n \n The total of all \u00echard cases\u00ee combined account for only 2-3, at most 5, percent of all abortion cases.\n \n If we believe that life is indeed sacred, it is inconsistent that the \u00ecquick fix\u00ee of abortion could ever be acceptable. Concessions for rape and incest suggest that no good can possibly come from bearing this child. But the circumstances of a child\u00eds conception do not have to dictate the remainder of his life. Julie Makimaa was conceived by an act of violent rape. She is both sympathetic toward her mother\u00eds suffering and proud of her courage and generosity. Julie founded Fortress International, an organization that defends rape and incest victims who have become pregnant and the children conceived by those acts. With David Reardon, she has co-authored a book that responds to the argument favoring abortion in assault pregnancies. \u00ecIt doesn\u00edt matter how I began,\u00ee says Julie. \u00ecWhat matters is who I will become.\u00ee\n \n Fact: All Life is Sacred\n \n In the fiery controversy of abortion in America, emotionally charged rhetoric rooted in fiction too often takes precedence over fact.\n \n But the facts speak for themselves. The unborn child is a precious human being who deserves legal protection. Women facing unplanned pregnancies must be embraced with compassion. Clearly, abortion is not compassion.\n \n It\u00eds time to shatter the myths of pro-abortion propaganda and determine that life will be America\u00eds choice.\n \n ",

In the blue response post, I point out that as usual you make unsubstantiated claims only with evidence of nothing.

By ignoring the reality of what these statistics represent:\n Statistically Negligible percentages of abortions due to rape, incest, cases which involve the deformity of the child or endanger the life of the mother:\n \n RAPE: .06%\n INCEST: 1%\n DEFORMITY: 2-4%\n THREAT TO MOTHER\u00edS LIFE: .06-1%\n \n The total of all hard cases combined account for only 2-3, at most 5, percent of all abortion cases.\n You are taking upon yourself the moral culpability of between 95 and 97% of the 1.3 million abortions that take place annually which you would never participate in yourself.\n \nPs; I'm prety sure the sun is hot ;)\n\n Now, on to some comedy relief. Regarding the bolded, The fictional exchange that ingus posted is the result of him failing at every turn at debating facts and issues with me, so he must actually manufacture a fictional, nonexistent exchange between us in order to assert that I'm as stupid as he is in reality. \n \n After all holly, it is ingus who has written at least fifty posts insisting that, and defending the belief that unborn babies are TRUE PARASITES. That is why he has to attribute such a wild assertion to me that the Sun is actually COLD. He understands how irrational his claim is so he had to attempt to attribute an equally outlandish claim to me so he didn't look as ignorant as he is. Just go back and read these most recent abortion debates, especially the \"Watch out for Sarah Palin\" thread, and you will see his delusional rants in all of their glory. \n \n What he forgot about is that attributing fictional dialogue to another member which is intended to defame him is a serious break with forum decorum and is frowned upon. I just thought it important to clear the air so you wouldn't think I actually said what ingus asserted I said.

Oh, and yes chester, his regime had everything to do with marxism as the second paragraph makes clear.\n Joseph Stalin\n \n AKA 'Koba', AKA 'Uncle Joe'. Stalin translates to 'Man of Steel'.\n \n Country: Former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR - Soviet Union).\n \n Kill tally: Approximately 20 million, including up to 14.5 million needlessly starved to death. At least one million executed for political \"offences\". At least 9.5 million more deported, exiled or imprisoned in work camps, with many of the estimated five million sent to the 'Gulag Archipelago' never returning alive. Other estimates place the number of deported at 28 million, including 18 million sent to the 'Gulag'.\n \n 1894 - Stalin wins a scholarship to the Tiflis Theological Seminary in the Georgian capital, moving to the city at a time when the empire is racked by dissent and heading closer to revolution. Once resident in Tiflis he joins the city's Marxist underground and becomes a leader of a clandestine Marxist group at the seminary. However, when his revolutionary activities are discovered, he is expelled.\n \n He takes up work as first a tutor then a clerk, devoting his nights to revolutionary pursuits. In 1898 he joins the Russian Social Democratic Party. \n \n 1922 - Stalin takes charge of the whole party administration when he is given the newly created post of general secretary of the Central Committee, a position that gives him control over party appointments and allows him to develop his power base. He will consolidate his influence further by spying on his colleagues, a tactic that will become a hallmark of his dictatorship.\n \n When Lenin suffers a stroke in May a troika (triumvirate) composed of Stalin, Lev B. Kamenev, and Grigorii V. Zinoviev assumes leadership of the party.\n \n Lenin recovers late in year and reasserts control. He criticises the troika and Stalin in particular, accusing him of using coercion to force non-Russian republics to join the Soviet Union and saying he is \"crude\" and is accumulating too much power through his office of general secretary. Though Lenin recommends that Stalin be removed from the position, the party takes no action. Stalin remains as general secretary when Lenin dies on 21 January 1924.\n \n 1925 - Following Lenin's death, the Kamenev-Zinoviev-Stalin troika again comes to prominence. Stalin consolidates his power base until he is able to break with Kamenev and Zinoviev. He has the city of Tsaritsin renamed Stalingrad (now Volgograd) and allows the development of a Stalin personality cult and propaganda campaign.\n \n From 1926 to 1930, he progressively ousts his opponents on the left and right of the party, silencing debate about options for the development of communism and the USSR. By the end of the decade Stalin has emerged as the supreme leader of the Soviet Union. He is hailed by cultists as a \"shining sun\", \"the staff of life\", a \"great teacher and friend\", the \"hope of the future for the workers and peasants of the world\" and the \"genius of mankind, the greatest genius of all times and peoples\".http://www.moreorless.au.com/killers/stalin.html",

Though Lenin recommends that Stalin be removed from the position, the party takes no action. Stalin remains as general secretary when Lenin dies on 21 January 1924.\n \n 1925 - Following Lenin's death, the Kamenev-Zinoviev-Stalin troika again comes to prominence. Stalin consolidates his power base until he is able to break with Kamenev and Zinoviev. He has the city of Tsaritsin renamed Stalingrad (now Volgograd) and allows the development of a Stalin personality cult and propaganda campaign.\n \n From 1926 to 1930, he progressively ousts his opponents on the left and right of the party, silencing debate about options for the development of communism and the USSR. By the end of the decade Stalin has emerged as the supreme leader of the Soviet Union. He is hailed by cultists as a \"shining sun\", \"the staff of life\", a \"great teacher and friend\", the \"hope of the future for the workers and peasants of the world\" and the \"genius of mankind, the greatest genius of all times and peoples\".Joseph Stalin killer file\n",
