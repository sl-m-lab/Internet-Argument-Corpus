   "Unfortunately we seem to be degenerating at an even faster rate than I could have anticipated on my own; to note our failure to reason according to evidence and facts, as well as to seek out the constant and unchanging truth contained in God's Holy Word. Evolution is neither based on facts, or any more relavant than the idea of a pretty pink bunny standing 10 feet tall that once stood and hopped in my backyard. I can find no fossil evidence, and certianly no proof of the skin pigmentation: yet I am convinced that there was a big pink bunny, and that it hopped sidways often. It probobly lived off of beautiful, big saliagn flowers; which, by the way, are also exstinct now. But I know those exist because I picked up a daisy, crushed it with limestone, mixed it with jelly, and burnt it in a large spoon slowly. The residue, when eaten by rabbits, seemed to cause almost immediate bursts of energy; seemingly dating the exact date of the extinct relative of the daisy at about 23 million ions. We have legitamate proof that this sopecies smelled nice based on the feeling I felt when I woke up last Thusday, the exact anniversary of this extinct species to the point, proved by the solar eclips last year in May sometime....\n \n \n THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION IS GARBAGE UNDER ANY REASONABLE SCRUTINY\n \n \n So, how were we created? How then did we come into being? This is a question that can only be answered through the many infallaqble proofs presented in The Bible (Not the Catholic Bible, not the Morman Bible, not the system of beliefs of the Seventh Day Heretics, ONLY through the proper Bible used by the modern \"protastant church\", though almost all mainline denominations of this sort are not completely accurate themselves; yet the Bible being used is <specifically watch for the KJV asnd the NKJV, avoid the newer TNIV<). Did you know that the Bible Taught to wash hands about two thousand years before America atarted to after the turn of the 19th century! Did you know that the Old Testament showed in all sorts of places thatr Jesus would in fact come and die for our sins hunreds and even thousands of years before we ever saw it in AD 33?! Did you know that there is a prophesy in Daniel that actually fortold the exact time Jesus would come?! NOT ONLY THAT, THERE ARE OVER 500 DOCUMENTED EYE WITNESSES WHO SAW JESUS RESURRECTED!!! AND NO EARLY CREDIBLE DOCUMENT OF ANY BODY, ANYWHERE! HE IS RESURRECTED, of this you can be sure, He is our hope of a new life apart fronm the penalty for all of our sin; which penalty is torment forever. God so loved you, that is why He sent Jesus, because of the fact that God so loved you. Now will you respond to the greatest of sacrifices, Jesus, the Lamb slain even for your sin; that you can be forgiven. You need to accept Jesus as the sacrifice for your sins, the penalty for sins is not what you want to bear when you face Jesus at death. \n The Bible says that if you will &#8220;confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.&#8221; And, &#8220;Whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.&#8221; So you need to call on the Name of the Lord Jesus and accept Jesus as your Lord and as the ultimate sacrifice for your sins. You need to cry out for another chance; Jesus said, &#8220;Whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it.&#8221; That means we have to be willing to give everything to Him, knowing He is our only hope. He is resurrected, and that proves that God was in fact behind everything Jesus taught. But it is a personal relationship that will save you. Pray a prayer asking Him to forgive you through His sacrifice at the Cross, with all your heart and everything that you have, and you will find life in Him. If you want to receive Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, pray this prayer aloud from your heart.\n \n \n \"Jesus, I know I am a sinner. I know that you died and were buried, and after three days rose again. Jesus, I believe in You with all my heart. I want to know You, and I want to serve You. Jesus, I know you are the Son of God that died for my sins. I am so far from perfect that I need You. Keep me forever; please Lord, for I know I cannot keep myself. Make whatever You will of my life, just that I may know You and you resurrected. I put my life in Your hands, and will not live to please myself any longer. Devil, you just lost me. Jesus, receive me as yours forever. I pray in Jesus Name.\"\n \n Awesome! I made this same decision over two years ago, and I have never been the same since. I was saved and delivered from drugs, sex, and a very violent lifestyle. Jesus is Good!@ You now need to find a local church that will baptize you as soon as you can. Contact me immediately through me e-mail at bensaved2001@hotmail.com. God Bless you.",

   "He is resurrected. Was there anyone who wanted to take me on in that?\n\n Sure, Ben. \n \n Let's talk about the very logical probability that some guy (who may or may not even have existed), rose from the dead after being crucified (or hung, not sure Acts 5:30). When Mary his (Virgin?) mother (or James' mother Mary and Salome Mark 16, or Joanna and several others Luke 24:10) and Mary Magdelene went to his tomb the huge heavy stone had rolled away from the doorway Mark, Luke, John or there may have been an earthquake and the Lord used the stone as a chair Matthew 28:2. There might have been a young man/angel clothed in white in the tomb Mark 16:5 or Simon/Peter and John, then appeared two angels and Jesus John 20:14. It's all a little fuzzy.\n \n Jesus is apparently a descendant of David through his father Joseph (who didn't \"father\" him at all), through his father, whose name was Heli Luke 4:22-38, or maybe Jacob Matthew 1:16. His 12 apostles were Simon (Peter), James and John (sons of Zebedee), Andrew, Phillip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James (son of Alphaeus), Thaddaeus, (another) Simon, and Judas Iscariot Mark 3:16-19. Then again, maybe there was another Judas (son of James) instead of a Thaddaeus Luke 6:14-16. Mark and Luke I guess would have made it fourteen, so they didn't count themselves.\n \n His coming was predicted in the scripture- \n \"Behold, a virgin will be with child, and will bring forth a son, and they will call his name Emmanuel ...\" Matthew 1:23, which is a translation of the Hebrew 'Hinneh ha-almah harah ve-yeldeth ben ve-karath shem-o immanuel.' which actually means 'Behold, the young woman has conceived and bears a son and calls his name Immanuel.' A slight difference, no virgin, and in the present tense, as it refers to King Ahab's royal lineage. \n \n This guy named Jesus (a common enough name of the time), came from Nazareth, a town for which there is not a shred of archeological evidence existed as described in the Gospels except maybe a couple centuries after Jesus' supposed death. He is called a Nazarene, \"And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.\" Matthew 2:23 Unfortunately, the prophets didn't say anything about a Nazarene. They did say \"For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.\" Judges 13:5 The whole shaving thing is because a Nazarite was a kind of priest grew their hair long, and the Angel of the Lord was very obviously talking to Manoah's wife, not prophesying the Messiah. \n \n There's a similar problem with the whole Matthew 2:6 reference to Bethlehem as the birthplace of the Messiah (or even \"ruler in Isreal\"). The Hebrew text of Micah 5:2 reads \"But thou, Bethlehem Ephrathah who is little among the clans of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be a ruler in Israel.\" He's clearly talking about the clan of descendants of Bethlehem, Caleb and his second wife Ephrathah's son, hoping one of them will conquer Assyria.\n \n I honestly haven't the time or inclination to continue, but suffice to say there are many, many more contradictions and impossibilities in this story, even if one were to accept the whole magical bearded God in the clouds thing.\n \n All of this isn't a difficult whale for you to swallow, but you want to try to distract from this fairy story a while and question the logic and evidence behind evolution? I'd take Australopithecus over the New Testament any day.",

How is that related in any way to evolutionary theory? Why do you think one must choose one or the other?\n\n \n \n \n Nearly all animal phyla* made their first appearance in the fossil record at essentially the same time, an interval of some 5 million years [ET**] (about 525 to 530 million years ago [ET**]) called the \"Cambrian Explosion.\"51\n \n Scientists have found that these early fossils exhibit more anatomical body designs than exist today, and that early animals, the trilobites, had eyes as fully developed as their counterparts today.38\n \n Many of the Cambrian fauna, still survive today, all looking much like they did over 500 million [ET**] years ago. The prominent British evolutionist, Richard Dawkins, comments, \"... [W]e find many of them already in an advanced state of evolution, the very first time they appear. It is as though they were just planted there, without any evolutionary history.\"51\n \n Two places in the world that have an abundance of early (Cambrian) fossils; the Burgess Shale in the Canadian Rockies and the Chengjiang site in China.38\n \n In Stephen J. Gould's popular book, Wonderful Life, he points out that the Burgess Shale Cambrian fossils include \"a range of disparity in anatomical design never again equaled, and not matched today by all the creatures in the world's oceans.\"38 \n \n Further, these fossils contain some twenty to thirty kinds of arthropods*** that cannot be placed in any modern group. The modern arthropods, consisting of almost a million species, can all fit into four major groups. But \"one quarry in British Columbia, representing the first explosion of multicellular life, reveals more than twenty additional arthropod designs.\" Today there are about 38 phyla in existence, but the Canadian, Chinese and other Cambrian sites reveal over fifty phyla.38\n \n There has been a decrease in diversity (probably due to global catastrophes). This is the reverse of what evolutionary theory predicts.38\n \n Besides diversity, the Burgess Shale shows exquisite detail, right down to \"the last filament of a trilobite's gill,\" or the last meal in a worm's gut.38\n \n The Chengjiang site has even greater detail, and is earlier. According to Paul Chien, the chairman of the biology department at the University of San Francisco, said the preservation is such that internal organs, nerves, and even the water ducts of jellyfish are observable.38\n \n Researchers found striking similarities between the compound eyes of the Cambrian trilobites and those of modern insects. According to Riccardo Levi-Setti, \"Trilobites could see in their immediate environment with amazingly sophisticated optical devices in the form of large composite eyes. ... The number of individual optical elements in the compound eye could vary from approximately one hundred to more than fifteen thousand in a single eye, a range not very different from that found in modern insects.\"38\n \n The conclusion is that the eye, a complex visual system, was fully formed and functional extremely early in the fossil record. Obviously, this is not predicted by evolutionary theory.38\n \n Until recently, the phylum of vertebrates had been considered a later arrival in evolutionary history. But not now! Even the vertebrate phylum now extends into the Cambrian period, especially with the recent discovery of two fossil fish in China.51\n \n The two new fossils . . . from Chengjiang are the most convincing Early Cambrian vertebrates ever found. The insects and other land invertebrates are also a very important group, and these practically all seem to be living fossils.51\n \n These complex animals were present at the beginning of multicellular life and did not appear later as is predicted by evolutionary theory.38\n \n Evolution does not explain the abrupt appearance of complex forms of life early in the fossil record or these fossils' unequaled diversity. The implication of the Cambrian explosion of diverse, fully functional, and multicellular life is that evolutionary theory is falsified.38\n \n Life did not start out simple and evolve into more complex and diverse animals; it was complex and diverse right at the beginning. This contradiction between the fossil data and the predictions of evolutionary theory falsifies the theory.38\n \n \"The facts of paleontology seem to support creation rather than evolution. All the major groups of invertebrates appear suddenly in the first fossiliferous strata. (Cambrian) of the earth with their distinct specializations, indicating that they were all created at almost the same time.\" - David Enock Associate Professor of Biology. BS Yeshiva College, MS Hunter College50\n \n Even George Gaylord Simpson, Harvard high priest of evolution had to admit, \"In spite of the examples, it remains true (as every paleontologist knows) that most new species, genera and families appear in the record suddenly, and are not led up to by known, gradual, completely continuous transitional sequences.\"50 \n \n \n http://www.straight-talk.net/evolution/explosion.htm",

The beginning of the Cambrian \"explosion\" has been dated to ~543 million years. And, this more accurate date for the base of the Cambrian has been known for more than 10 years!\n \n \n\"Precise geochronological dating of the Cambrian using methods of radiometric determination is only in its infancy. In the past few years particular attention has been devoted to the age of the base of the Cambrian. From figures of c. [circa] 590 Ma, which until recently were widely accepted, the estimate for the beginning of the Cambrian has dropped dramatically, to about 545 Ma. The details can be found in a paper by S. A. Bowring and others (Science, Vol. 261, pp. 1293-8 [1993]), in which precise determinations of U/Pb (uranium/lead) ratios in zircons are presented. A number of earlier papers were in fact already strongly pointing to such an age for the base of the Cambrian (e.g. work by Compston and other reported in the Journal of the Geological Society, London, Vol. 149, pp. 171-184[1992]).\" (The Crucible of Creation: The Burgess Shale and the Rise of Animals, Simon Conway Morris, Oxford University Press, 1998, p111) \n\n \n \n\"In the 1960s the base of the Cambrian was determined to be 570 million years old, and this date appears on age compilations even in the late 1980s. Recently, however, there have been significant improvements in radiometric dating techniques. The Precambrian/Cambrian boundary is now dated at 543 million years old. The \"Middle\" Cambrian is dated at about 510 million years ago, whereas the oldest trilobites are no more than 522 million years old, which suggests that the bulk of Cambrian time was \"pre-trilobite\"\". (Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe, Peter D. Ward & Donald Brownlee, Copernicus/Springer-Verlag, 2000, p130 - 131)\n\n \n 2) Even if we accept the statement \"Nearly all animal phyla* made their first appearance [about 543 - 525 million years ago]\" (note the * ... wonder what that material says), it still doesn't address the appearance of the vast majority of species, or of higher taxa like genera and classes. Why are there no robins, eagles, vultures, chickens, emus, frogs, turtles, lizards, alligators, sharks, carp, perch, dolphins, whales, seals, foxes, rabbits, cats, dogs, deer, antelope, zebra, horses, kangaroos, elephants, bats, monkeys, chimps, humans, and so on in the Burgess Shale or other Cambrian strata? Evolution has a perfectly reasonable, and supported, explanation. But if God created all animals on \"day x\", then we should expect to find all types of animals - elephants & humans & mice, trilobites, and dinosaurs of all various sizes and mobilities, for example - all mixed in the same strata ... but we don't. (PS: And \"flood sorting\" doesn't resolve this problem with the religious, Creationist position).\n \n 3) The Cambrian \"explosion\" was not really a sudden explosion, but more of a extended event. A recent article (The Early Evolution of Animals, David J Bottjer, Scientific American, August 2005) describes a bilaterian - a bilaterally symmetrical animal - found in strata that is dated to between 580 million and 600 million years old. That's roughly 45 to 50 million years prior to the beginning of the Cambrian explosion. And the author adds ...\n \n \n\"Biological complexity of the kind seen in [the bliaterian] Vernanimalcula implies a period of evolution that transpired long before the 580-million-to-600-million-year-old world in which the tiny animal lived.\"\n",

   "There has been a decrease in diversity (probably due to global catastrophes). This is the reverse of what evolutionary theory predicts.38\n\n \n No, it's not. \n \n The conditions under which evolution operated during the Cambrian/Vendian times were different from the conditions following that time in two main ways, and these differences can potentially account for the origin of the many animal body plans during those early periods and the lack of new ones since. \n \n First, ~540 million years ago most animals were very much simpler (fewer cells, for example) than they are today, so changes to their developmental programs would have been better tolerated. The more complex any system is (the more parts it has, and the more coordinated and well-matched those parts must be, etc.), the more rigidly constrained and less amenable to a given magnitude of change it is. So the simpler developmental processes (simpler adult-form end product, fewer interactions between developmental genes, etc.) of early animals would have allowed for a 'large-scale' change to be incorporated into that animal's ontogeny, though if a change of the same magnitude were to occur today, it would be too disruptive to the complex developmental program and would be eliminated (note that 'large-scale change' refers to the adult form: the actual change that caused that altered end result could be a typical small scale mutation, in an early developmental stage). This it not to propose Goldschmidt's \"hopeful monsters\" that occur due to 'macromutations', but rather an intermediate position between that and the \"only micromutations\" view of gradualistic neo-Darwinism. And, as just mentioned, mutations in developmental processes (even ones that resulted in 'macromutations' in the adult form) would have been more tolerated in the simpler animals that existed ~540 mya than they would be in today's. \n \n Second, ~540 million years ago animal diversity was extremely more limited than it is today, so there was a huge number of open niches: a plentitude the likes of which has never again existed on our planet. An organism that happened to find itself in one of the multitude of open niches (by means of a \"semi-macro\" mutation, the product of a change in a developmental gene) would have faced little if any competition. The reduced external competition would potentially allow the morphological variation(s), that would otherwise likely have been eliminated, to persist. (The sudden change could leave the organism with a lower level of internal coordination: over time, internal coadaptation could evolve to 'catch up' with the change in morphology: these internal adjustments would leave no trace in the fossil record). \n \n Combining these two ideas produces a reasonable explanation of the 'explosion' in new body plans in Vendian/Cambrian times.",

   "The conclusion is that the eye, a complex visual system, was fully formed and functional extremely early in the fossil record. Obviously, this is not predicted by evolutionary theory.38\n\n \n Misleading: having complex eyes in trilobites in no way contradicts evolution. \n \n 1) Evolution holds that primitive eyespots predated the Cambrian explosion (probably in a small, simple worm of some sort ... and 'worm tracks' have been found in pre-Cambrian strata). This is based on genetic evidence such as the \"universality\" across quite diverse animal phyla of Pax and other regulatory genes involved in the development of visual systems in extant animals.\n \n 2) We know of extant organisms simpler than trilobites that have simpler \"visual\" systems, such as some algae, sponge larvae, the unicellular Euglena, and some jelly fish, all of which use photoreceptors for phototaxis. Evolutionary theory holds that these simpler organisms - with their pre-visual photoreceptors - arose prior to triolobites.\n \n \n\"Gehring has reviewed the possibility that the jellyfish eye may have preceded brain evolution (Gehring, 2002). He supports this view by noting that unicellular algae (i.e. Chlamydomonas) or dinoflagellates (i.e. Erythropsis) have eye organelles and no brain. Jellyfish do, however, have a number of specialized ganglia associated with the rhopalia as well as an interconnected nerve ring which may, arguably, be a type of brain for a radially symmetrical animal (Coates, 2003). An attractive feature of eye before brain is that it places sense reception before information processing. Examples of ancestral photoreception preceding a central nervous system are fascinating. One is Chlamydomonas reihhardtii (Roberts et al., 2001). The eyespot of this unicellular alga orchestrates a positive phototaxis in low intensity light and a negative phototaxis in high intensity light by directly affecting the beating pattern of the two attached flagellae. Surprisingly, the Chlamydomonas eye2-1 mutant revealed that formation of the eyespot requires a member of the thioredoxin protein family and that this developmental role does not depend on the catalytic redox capability of the thioredoxin protein. The sponge larva, Reneira sp., provides another example of coordinated phototaxis in a multicellular organism that lacks nerve cells altogether (Leys and Degnan, 2001). A posterior ring of columnar epithelial cells containing a cilia and pigmented-filled protrusions respond directly to light, leading to negative phototaxis and directed swimming behavior. Increased light intensity makes the cilia rigid and subsequently bend, shielding the pigmented vesicles; decreased light intensity reverses the process. The resulting negative phototaxis is similar to the shadow response of tunicates and the unicellular Euglena. Spectral sensitivity tests suggest that the photoreceptive pigment in the sponge larva may be a flavin or carotenoid (Leys et al., 2002). This would make the sponge larva the first metazoan not using a rhodopsin-like protein as the primary photoreceptive pigment. It is not known yet whether expression of PaxB, which is present in sponges (Hoshiyama et al., 1998), is associated with the photoreceptive cilia in the sponge larva. Clearly, detailed studies on ancestral eyes and photoresponses are a rich source of new and unexpected insights. \n \n Planula larvae of Tripedalia also have a photoreceptive system that appears to be directly connected to cilia for steering towards particular light conditions. A series of single-cell, pigment cup ocelli, lacking neural connections, surround the posterior half of the larval ectoderm (Nordstrom et al., 2003) (see also Gehring in this issue). The positions of these ocelli vary in different species of cubozoan larvae. These light sensors apparently have photosensitive microvilli and a motor-cilium. The cilium responds directly to light and may act as a rudder to steer the larva. Thus, while ciliated and rhabdomeric photoreceptors are occasionally found in the same species, this is the first instance of the latter being reported in cnidarians.\"\n (Cubozoan jellyfish: an Evo/Devo model for eyes and other sensory systems, JORAM PIATIGORSKY and ZBYNEK KOZMIK2, Int. J. Dev. Biol. 48: 719-729 (2004)) \n",

   "And while on the subject of Creationists' lowlife tactic of quoting out of context, here's probably the definitive case.\n \n The quote is from another site, by a YEC. The following is just a single specific instance of the general case: this particular statement by Darwin is quoted out of context regularly, by various Creationists.\n \n \nAlso astonishing is the eye's amazing construction and activity. The degree of complexity displayed in the construction of the various parts of the eye makes the eye an impossible item for humans to currently design and manufacture. Charles Darwin himself admitted that the intricate engineering displayed in the human eye was so specialized and complex that he could not begin to imagine how the eye might have developed through the evolutionary process of natural selection.\n \n ************************************\n \"To suppose the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd to the highest degree.\" (the origin of species) \n ************************************\n \n\n \n This is an out-of-context quote in that Darwin immediately thereafter says that he can see how eyes could be the product of natural selection. Darwin's statement is analogous to a physicist who is discussing relativity saying, \"I freely confess that it seems absurd to the highest degree that observer A can see event X occur before event Y, whereas observer B can see the same event X occur after the same event Y\"; then the physicist continuing by explaining how relativity theory actually shows that the time order of two events can be different for two observers in relative motion, traveling in opposite directions between the two widely spaced points of interest. What would be the physicist's actual position? That the time order of two events cannot be reversed, or that they can? Obviously, the latter. And anyone who selectively quotes just the \"absurd to the highest degree\" portion in order to try to make it look like he actually believes the opposite is quoting out of context. Same logic applies to the Creationists' out-of-context quote of Darwin.\n \n And now for the evidence supporting the charge of quoting out of context. Here's a more complete version of Darwin's statement, showing what Darwin's actual position on eye evolution is, which is quite different from what the Creationists would have us believe.\n \n \n\"To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest degree. Yet reason tells me, that if numerous gradations from a perfect and complex eye to one very imperfect and simple, each grade being useful to its possessor, can be shown to exist; if further, the eye does vary ever so slightly, and the variations be inherited, which is certainly the case; and if any variation or modification in the organ be ever useful to an animal under changing conditions of life, then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection, though insuperable by our imagination, can hardly be considered real.\" (Charles Darwin, The Origin of Species) \n",

Nothing about monkeys is to be found. Moreover, the complete quotation is not to be found anywhere in the entire article, ruling out the possibility that Gish is merely guilty of sloppy scholarship and twice cited the wrong page number. \n \n On the preceding page, p. 20, we do find a fair portion of the text in question: \n \n ********************************\n \"To this hypothesis, as fantastic as it is ingenious, I may be permitted to prefer one which seems to me to be just as satisfactory, being simpler and more in conformity with the totality of what we know: the hunter was a true man, whose stone industry has been found and who made Sinanthropus his victim!\"\n ********************************\n \n Assuming the material in square brackets is material inserted by Gish - in conformity with accepted scholarly practice - we still must ask whence came the crucial phrase, \"that the owners of the monkey-like skulls were the authors of the large-scale industry\"? \n \n That Gish (or a friend who could read French) had indeed seen page 20 is evident from his next paragraph, which gives a reasonable translation for a phrase which I have translated above: \"more in conformity with our whole body of knowledge.\" But where - page 20 or anywhere in the article - does Gish find justification for the conclusion of this paragraph: \n \n ********************************\n \"...

[emphasis added by author of web page]\n ********************************\n \n Nowhere does Boule ever suggest that Peking Man was monkey-like.

He replied: \n \n ********************************\n In an effort to discredit the PBS Evolution series, the quotes attributed to me and circulated on the creationist Discovery Institute's website were taken completely out of context. I do not believe, nor have I ever argued, that paleoanthropology is not a scientific endeavor. The out-of-context quotes derive from a paper in which I argue a technical point to other scientists in the fields of archaeology and paleoanthropology: I encourage them to pay more attention to collecting data with an explicit conceptual framework firmly in mind, rather than just assembling factual information. As in all good science, anthropologists must regularly re-examine their approaches, and I never intended to imply that paleoanthropology is unscientific. \n ********************************\n \n While there are many views of humans, and of the place of humans in the natural world, there is only one scientific view--that of neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory.\" \n (http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/947_pr97_9262001__discovery_ins_9_26_2001.asp) \n \n",

I did.\n \nSo many questions arise in the study of fossils (paleontology) that even many evolutionary paleontologists put little stock in the fossil record. Basing one's belief in evolution on the shaky ground of paleontology can scarcely be considered scientific.35\n \n \"We are about 120 years after Darwin and the knowledge of the fossil record has been greatly expanded. We now have a quarter of a million species but the situation hasn't changed much. The record of evolution is still surprisingly jerky and, ironically, we have fewer examples of evolutionary transition than we had in Darwin's time.\" - Dr. David M. Raup, Curator of Geology, Museum of Natural History, Chicago14 (http://www.straight-talk.net/evolution/fossil.htm) \n\n \n \n Gee, gives the impression that Dr. David M. Raup, Curator of Geology, Museum of Natural History, Chicago, puts little stock in the fossil record and rejects evolution, helping support the preceding assertion that surely one's belief in evolution based on paleontology can scarcely be considered scientific.\n \n But that's not at all what Dr. Raup was stating. While Googling for a fuller quote, I ran across a page that showed how this - and many other - statements by Dr. Raup were distorted by Creationists. \n \n To start with, here is a fuller quote:\n \n \n\"Well, we are now about 120 years after Darwin and the knowledge of the fossil record has been greatly expanded. We now have a quarter of a million fossil species but the situation hasn't changed much. The record of evolution is still surprisingly jerky and, ironically, we have even fewer examples of evolutionary transition than we had in Darwin's time. By this I mean that some of the classic cases of darwinian change in the fossil record, such as the evolution of the horse in North America, have had to be discarded or modified as a result of more detailed information -- what appeared to be a nice simple progression when relatively few data were available now appears to be much more complex and much less gradualistic. So Darwin's problem has not been alleviated in the last 120 years and we still have a record which does show change but one that can hardly be looked upon as the most reasonable consequence of natural selection. Also the major extinctions such as those of the dinosaurs and trilobites are still very puzzling. (http://www.geocities.com/osarsif/ce01.htm)\n\n \n The page linked to just above explains how a letter was sent to Dr. Raup asking for his statements about how he had been quoted by a Creationist journal (one of the quotes being the one being addressed here). Of course Dr. Raup's reply shows that he does not reject the fossil record, nor evolution, nor the fact that the fossil record documents evolution.\n \n The page also lists numerous other Creationist distortions of Dr. Raup's statements.",

   "And the non-Creationist page mentioned in my last post also shows examples of Creationists playing quote games with statements made by other experts, such as Richard Lewontin. Here's part of that discussion ... Lewontin's published comments about the way Creationists play with quotes.\n \n \nLewontin specifically complained about this practice:\n \n **************************************************\n Partly through honest confusion, but also partly through a conscious attempt to confuse others, creationists have muddled the disputes about evolutionary theory with the accepted fact of evolution to claim that even scientists call evolution into question. By melding our knowledge of what has happened in evolution with our doubts about how this has happened into a single \"theory of evolution,\" creationists hope to challenge evolution with evolutionists' own words. Sometimes creationists plunge more deeply into dishonesty by taking statements of evolutionists out of context to make them say the opposite of what was intended. For example, when, in an article on adaptation, I described the outmoded nineteenth-century belief that the perfection of creation was the best evidence of a creator, this description was taken into creationist literature as evidence for my own rejection of evolution. Such deliberate misuse of the literature of evolutionary biology, and the transparent subterfuge of passing off the Old Testament myth of creation as if it were creation \"science\" rather than the belief of a particular religion, has convinced most evolutionists that creationism is nothing but an ill-willed attempt to suppress truth in the interest of propping up a failing institution. But such a view badly oversimplifies the situation and misses the deep social and political roots of creationism.18\n **************************************************\n \n Lewontin also complained about the practice of misquoting scientists, in the magazine Creation/Evolution, Fall 1981, on page 35:\n \n **************************************************\n Modern expressions of creationism and especially so-called \"scientific\" creationism are making extensive use of the tactic of selective quotation in order to make it appear that numerous biologists doubt the reality of evolution. The creationists take advantage of the fact that evolutionary biology is a living science containing disagreements about certain details of the evolutionary process by taking quotations about such details out of context in an attempt to support the creationists' antievolutionary stand. Sometimes they simply take biologists' descriptions of creationism and then ascribe these views to the biologists themselves! These patently dishonest practices of misquotation give us a right to question even the sincerity of creationists.\n **************************************************\n (http://www.geocities.com/osarsif/ce01.htm) \n",

I have seen both evolutionists and creationists quote people, including myself, out of context. I have also seen both quoting people in context. Trust me, in context is the norm among experienced creationists.\nWell, I don't trust you. I have seen creationists quote out of context with the clear purpose of deceiving readers over and over again.

I've seen them do it once or twice a week for more than a decade. As for the purpose of doing so, Stephen Jay Gould opined that the reason was either design or stupidity. I think it is a mixture - an original quote out of context by design in order to deceive, followed by other creationists who copy that quote out of stupidity.\n \n As for Toxey's purpose in offering that out of context quote, judging from the quality of his other work I suspect it wasn't from design.\n \n The source of many creationist out of context quotes is the Revised Quote Book, published in Australia in 1990. It is \"revised\" because the original was filled with altered and invented quotes. The effort to deceive was so apparent that even creationists (who had been embarrassed by using the invented quotes) complained and it was withdrawn from publication.

Frankly, DE, you need to select one argument at a time, and work through it. \n \n To note, I am not saying that DE makes poor quality posts. I am saying that he makes so many posts that they are, in their own way, Spam. So, again, DE I ask you to select one of your numerous arguments and we can work through it.\n\n \n \n Except, of course, the point of out of context quotes from sources is a very important When someone bases their arguement on positions that their opponent does NOT have, based on out of context quotes, that is a 'strawman' arguement. That is either ignorance, or dishonesty. DE docuemented that when it comes to arguements, the vast majority of quotes from scientists that creationsists use are out of context. He demonstrated that this is done repeatedly and very consistantly. \n \n DE came to the conclusion that this was due to dishonesty. I don't think it matters, but it does discredit the arguements from the creationists.",

   "Oh, TS, you exceed my expectations! I say you are only going to bring up nonsense like Piltdown Man and try to show how it proves scientists are liars, and what do you do?\n \n \nCloser examination of the fossil revealed file marks on the teeth - the fossils that were pieced together to make it had been treated with chemicals to increase the supposed evolutionary age.\n\n And who discovered all this? Why, I believe it was the scientists who were studying it. And I'm willing to bet there wasn't a creationist anywhere around.\n \n \nIt is said that more than five hundred doctoral dissertations were written on Piltdown.\n\n Turns out there are more than likely none:\n Dissertations\n \n \nPiltdown man demonstrates a very important point: that science is not self correcting \n\n How do you figure? It was science that demonstrated that Piltdown was a fraud, science that announced that fact, and science that threw Piltdown out of the equation. Still not a creationist in sight...\n \n \nTaking 38-45 years to discover the obvious is hardly a case of self-correction.\n\n \n Seeing as how some of the tests used to raise the possibility that Piltdown was a fraud weren't available until that time, and the fraudulent find was what was expected to be found, I fail to see how this is a failing of science. And yes, it still is a case of self correction, unless creationists have begun redefining that word as well.\n \n Never mind the fact that Piltdown Man was increasingly marginalized for two decades before it was conclusively proven to be a fraud:\n \n \nIt should be remembered that, at the time of Piltdown finds, there were very few early hominid fossils; Homo neanderthalensis and Homo sapiens were clearly fairly late. It was expected that there was a \"missing link\" between ape and man. It was an open question as to what that missing link would look like. Piltdown man had the expected mix of features, which lent it plausibility as a human precursor.\n \n This plausibility did not hold up. During the next two decades there were a number of finds of ancient hominids and near hominids, e.g. Dart's discovery of Australopithecus, the Peking man discoveries, and other Homo erectus and australopithecine finds. Piltdown man did not fit in with the new discoveries. None the less, Sir Arthur Keith (a major defender of Piltdown man) wrote in 1931:\n \n It is therefore possible that Piltdown man does represent the early pleistocene ancestor of the modern type of man, He may well be the ancestor we have been in search of during all these past years. I am therefore inclined to make the Piltdown type spring from the main ancestral stem of modern humanity... \n \n In the period 1930-1950 Piltdown man was increasingly marginalized and by 1950 was, by and large, simply ignored. It was carried in the books as a fossil hominid. From time to time it was puzzled over and then dismissed again. The American Museum of Natural History quietly classified it as a mixture of ape and man fossils. Over the years it had become an anomaly; some prominent authors did not even bother to list it. In Bones of Contention Roger Lewin quotes Sherwood Washburn as saying\n \n \"I remember writing a paper on human evolution in 1944, and I simply left Piltdown out. You could make sense of human evolution if you didn't try to put Piltdown into it.\" \n \n Finally, in 1953, the roof fell in. Piltdown man was not an ancestor; it was not a case of erroneous interpretation; it was a case of outright deliberate fraud. \n\n \n Here's more info:\n Piltdown Man",
