   "A Canadian MP Writes.\n   Time to end this failed experiment \n Reality has not seemed to matter to those who support retention of the long-gun registry. In fact, the information it contains has been shown to be incomplete and unreliable. The compliance rate is estimated at only 50 per cent which effectively renders it useless. The Department of Justice has found through studies that among homicides, 84 per cent of the firearms used in the commission of the crimes are unregistered, and close to 75 per cent were illegal guns smuggled into Canada. \n \n The registry is not nearly ready for use, with only seven million of the 16.5 million guns in Canada registered. More than 300,000 owners of previously registered handguns still don't have a firearms licence. With the registry costing close to $2 billion dollars already, it is now estimated it may cost another $1 billion to complete it. The focus of the debate is on the so-called long guns, with proponents of the registry claiming that rifles and shotguns are the weapon of choice for criminals and are the most used firearms in crime. In fact, where firearms were used in violent crimes in Canada, more than 71 per cent involved handguns. Only nine per cent involved rifles and shotguns and, of these, just 2.1 per cent were registered. The government does believe strongly in gun safety and there is an intention to retain effective sections of the licensing system. Unfortunately, there are in our country, those who do not possess the necessary attitudes or responsibilities to qualify as gun owners, and licences can be denied or education provided to correct these instances. Safe storage practices will also continue to be part of the law.\n \n The motivation of all parties in this debate is generally commendable, to try to offset or prevent the tragedies involving firearms and to ensure more safety and suppression of illegal weapons of any sort. The long-gun registry does not accomplish these objectives, is ridiculously expensive and wasteful, and discriminates against and inconveniences our law-abiding and responsible citizens. It's an experiment that has failed and should never have been tried in the first place.\n",

Of course since they are broke now its not likely they will finish soon. The Coast Guard not able to put to sea. Buying junk subs from the Brits and not to mention all the money paid out in the dole. They can't even get their crime figures straight for Pete's sake. Of course they have no constituional protections up there so what is to hinder confiscation. ",

   "Most people are probably not aware that NY has had a gun registry for what? About 20 years? and it has never helped solve a crime.\n\n \n Actually its one of the oldest gun laws on the books.\n \n The Sullivan Act, also known as the Sullivan Law, is a controversial gun control law in New York State. Upon first passage, the Sullivan Act required licenses for New Yorkers to possess firearms small enough to be concealed. Possession of such firearms without a license was a misdemeanor, carrying them was a felony. The possession or carrying of weapons such as brass knuckles, sandbags, blackjacks, bludgeons or bombs was a felony, as was possessing or carrying a dagger, \"dangerous knife\" or razor \"with intent to use the same unlawfully\". Named for its primary legislative sponsor, state senator Timothy Sullivan, a notoriously corrupt Tammany Hall politician, it dates to 1911, and is still in force, making it one of the older existing gun control laws in the United States.\n \n Many believe the act was to discriminate against immigrants in New York, particularly Italians, as the first person arrested under the law was mobster Giuseppe Costabile. Whether this was part of the law's intent, it was passed on a wave of anti-immigrant rhetoric as a measure to disarm an alleged criminal element. The police granted the licenses, and could easily discriminate against \"undesirable\" elements. Sponsor \"Big Tim\" Sullivan reputedly desired the law so that his criminal cohorts could go about their activities unimpeded by citizens defending themselves with concealed handguns. It was used against political enemies by dropping a small pistol into an overcoat pocket. Thus having them arrested and put in jail for violation. Big Tim stepped in front of a speeding subway train.",
