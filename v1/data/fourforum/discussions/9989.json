   "Some things which could stump a creationist (I can't post links):\n \n Wiukipedia -< Nylonase\n \"In 1975 a team of Japanese scientists discovered a strain of Flavobacterium living in ponds containing waste water from a factory producing nylon that was capable of digesting certain byproducts of nylon-6 manufacture, such as, 6-aminohexanoate linear dimer, even though those byproducts had not existed prior to the invention of nylon in 1935.\"\n \n ---------------------\n \n Somewhere on msnbc.com\n \"The rare discovery of eggs inside a dinosaur has given scientists new clues about the reproductive biology of the creatures and more support for the theory that birds came from dinosaurs.\n \n The pair of shelled eggs is the first of its kind found inside a dinosaur, said researchers who reported the discovery in Friday's issue of the journal Science.\n \n Scientists found the dinosaur produced eggs in some ways like a crocodile and in other ways like a bird. Crocodiles and similar primitive reptiles have two ovaries enabling them to lay a clutch of eggs. Birds have a single ovary and can only lay one egg at a time.\"\n \n Does anybody who thinks animals don't evolve care to explain any of this?",

The classic way of pointing this out is to ask where all that X is if its not consumed by \"bugs\" of one sort or another. They eat asphalt, they eat many plastics, they eat many synthetics, etc etc etc. Its all chemistry after all and the boundaries between man-made structures and natural ones is effectively non-existent.",
