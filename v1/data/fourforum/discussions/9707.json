Heck, I even went through PZ's some thousand posts on the website, and nothing about you turned up. I just have to wonder if you've actually discussed EAM on IIDB.\n\n \n **\n Not that your opinion matters a damn, collin, but I debated p z myers back ion 2001 when he went by the sobriquet \"PZ\" at IIDB, and after I was banned from IIDB for being anti-zionist (they slanderously called my anti-zionist, anti-racist, anti-fascist, political stance, \"anti-semitism\"), since there was no other way to get rid of the guy who was making them all look like fools in the evolution forum. I was only at IIDB for less than 3 months, thanks to this chicanery, from about June to August, 2001, if memory serves.\n \n Later, at ARN, I denated both pz and richard b hoppe on a regular basis, first pz until he droppedout, and then rbh in later years until he dropped out. Eventually I was banned by ARN for being too stridently anti-fascist and anti-neocon, ie., anti-zionist. But, truth be told, I was way over the bounds of politeness there, as I was trying to break free of my \"ARN addiction\" by getting banned. Nothing like the despicable behaviour carried out many years earlier at IIDB.\n \n Now, if you are unable to archive that, there was also a latterday PZMYERS bit taken from the Panda's Thumb (for some strange reason I'm not allowed to register there?!?:))that I posted at ARN a year or so back that made pz\n look such a silly mook that he and his little claque chattered and gibbered about it for several days at PT.\n \n Neither RBK's distorted comparison's of computer processes to RMNS nor pz's genetic yammerings hold any terrors for me. If I was able to post on their little private podiums I would continue to rip them up, so you know they're never going to let that happen.\n \n You just go on believing what you want to believe. It's what you're good at.",
