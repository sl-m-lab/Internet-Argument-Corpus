Or is it just the idea that someone would try to make a teflon bullet an emotional issue with anti-gunners?\n \n 2) It is impossible to make a plastic pistol barrel. There is no such thing. You can make plastic receivers and parts, but the barrel has enough metal to be detectable by a blind airport x-ray operator or metal detector. \n \n The only non-metal pistol barrels are made of ceramic. They also have a habit of blowing up without notice killing the shooter.\n \n This is just more false anti-gun myths.",

   "I think these two issues came up back in the 1980s. Owing to the efforts of Handgun Control, cop-killer bullets for handguns were made illegal. Rifle ammo can still pierce body armor, but I think this is okay since it is mostly handguns that are used to commit crimes. \n \n If it's impossible to manufacture a plastic gun that can fire real bullets, why was there a debate about it? It must be possible because congress passed a law that banned the manufacture of plastic guns.

I'm not an expert on bullet-proof vests, but it seems to me that they have a finite life, that after they recieve several hits they are useless.

   "Here's something interesting on the subject. This is a quote from the 7th Edition of Military Small Arms of the 20th Century. the quote comes from Mr. Ian V. Hogg, who is, everyone can agree, an authority on the subject of small arms. He edited \"Jane's Infantry Weapons\" from 1972-1994. Mr. Hogg says: \n \n \"The other significant designe feature was the increasing use of synthetic materials - plastic, carbon fiber and so forth - ... In the early days, too, there was a good deal of to-do by the press over the prospect of a 'plastic pistol' which would be completely invisible to the X-ray eye of the airport baggage checker. Once the design wizards have solved the problem of making a plastic barrel, firing plastic cartridges and bullets and using plastic return springs, we may have a problem; but not yet, Oh Lord, not yet.\"",

   "KNOWLEDGE IS POWER\n \n \n \n \n \n Dear sheeple, (those that support this sort of nonsense)\n \n You have been duped once again by your media overlords. Please read on:\"\n \n Show me one incident when these so called \"cop killer bullets\" where used to defeat the armor of a police officer.... (hint.... you can not)... Also note the simple fact that Teflon CAN NOT (on its own) penetrate ANY armor.... \n \n \"Cop-killer\" Bullets\n \n \n \"In January of 1982, NBC Television broadcast a sensationalist prime time special titled \"Cop Killer Bullets.\" Law enforcement officials had asked NBC not to air the program as the use of body armor by police officers was still not common knowledge and the \"KTW\" ammunition was virtually unheard of outside law enforcement circles. The safety of law enforcement officers took a back seat to ratings at NBC however and they not only broadcast the show, but re-broadcast it again six months later. \n \n Following significant media hype and widespread misconceptions, Congress got into the act and proposed legislation that would have outlawed any bullet based on its ability to penetrate certain bullet resistant material. The FBI, Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms, and other forensic experts cautioned that the proposed ban was too vague to be enforceable. The NRA opposed the proposed law since it would have banned not only the controversial armor piercing handgun rounds, but nearly all conventional rifle ammunition as well. (Most rifle ammunition will easily penetrate the most commonly worn protective vests.) \"\n \n \"Here are the facts: \n \n - \"Armor piercing\" ammunition is only legally available to law enforcement agencies and to the armed forces. \n \n - Rather than opposing the ban on \"armor piercing\" ammunition, the NRA was in fact instrumental in crafting the law that Congress ultimately passed. \n \n - When properly wearing the appropriate body armor, not one law enforcement officer has ever been killed by a handgun bullet penetrating their vest. The National Institute of Justice (NIJ) certifies three levels of body armor. The most commonly worn, Level IIA, offers realistic protection against all .22, .25, .32, .380, and .38, caliber handgun ammunition, against most 9mm, .357 Magnum, .40 S&W, .45 ACP and .44 Magnum handgun ammunition and against 000 buck shotgun pellets. Level II and Level IIIA armor protects from even greater threats including 12 gauge shotgun slugs and the \"hottest\" .44 Magnum rounds. \n \n \"Cop-killer\" bullets are a myth born from media hype and nurtured by unrealistic Hollywood portrayals and the deliberately misleading claims of the anti-gun lobby. An objective, rational look at the facts quickly separates the myth from the reality. Knowledge is power. \"\n \n \n Open up.... your eyes now..... Can you see clearly?\n \n \n Sincerely,\n \n Reverend HellH0und\n \n \n P.S. MOLON LABE!",
