In both cases innocent people get killed. You expect the Palestinians to put on uniforms and start shooting at Israeli soldiers. This won't happen.

   "Gator, thanks for your comment. This is something I have been thinking about recently and am testing my idea. You make some great points and I want to respond to all.\n \n I have watched the Israeli/Palestinian conflict for decades and don't expect it to end. The Palestinians are a group of unorganized people with little power as a \"group\". I hope to see the conflict end someday.\n \n \nI would like to see the Palestinians act in such way that they DESERVE their own state. The last thing the world needs is another state ruled by terrorists and thugs. The Arab states already include plenty of autocratic regimes. The Palestinian Arab leadership has waged violence against Palestinian Jews since their first riots in 1920. As long as their primary goal remains the destruction of Israel, they don't deserve a state.\n \n\n \n Your statement lumps all Palestinians together. Not all Palestinians are terrorists.\n \n \nLet them first demonstrate a willingness and capacity to establish and sustain national democratic institutions. This can be done under a semi-autonomous arrangement or perhaps a UN trusteeship. They'll can be given a conditional guarantee of future sovereignty, if all goes well and they uphold their commitment to living in peace alongside the Jewish state. \n \n \n That is my point, let the Palestinians establish national democratic institutions. Most Palestinians would like to live in peace, raise a family and prosper.\n \n \n I see you prefer the euphemistic term \"militant\" to describe terrorists who intentionally murder innocent civilians and publicly vow they will accept nothing short of Israel's total annihilation. If you give these terrorists their own independent state without restrictions on the rights that normally accrue to sovereign states, then they may very well be positioned to drive Israeli society into the sea. \n\n \n No Arab country can drive Israel into the sea. \n \n If Israel continues to fire rockets into apartments killing innocent people (even accidentally), the \"militants\" will rise to power.\n \n I used the term militant because if they have not committed a terrorist act, I would not consider them a terrorist yet. There are more militants than terrorists. In fact there are more militants everyday while the Israelis continue their assault.\n \n \n Apparently you can't fathom the indefensible nature of the armistice line. Perhaps you live in America where you feel rather secure from sea to shining sea, protected by two oceans and friendly neighbors to the north and south. I suspect that if the shoe were on the other foot you wouldn't be so trusting or as quick to dismiss the threat of being \"driven into the sea.\" \n\n \n Like I said, Israel is not going to be \"driven into the sea\".\n \n Many Americans in the inner cities live in terror. This does not give the authorities the right to violate due process.\n \n \n\n \n \n No nation in the world would dare empower such a hostile state right on their doorstep. Why should you expect Israel to do so? The pre-1967 armistice line that defines the West Bank is only 9 miles from the Mediterranean Sea. The bulk of Israel's population and industrial capacity is concentrated in that narrow waist of land. You can literally stand on the high ground of the West Bank and look down on the outskirts of Tel Aviv with the unaided eye. Nine miles wide! \n\n \n What do you think the Israelis' should do? Will it ever end?\n \n \n Fighting terrorists who engage in suicide bombings is not a job for the police force. It's a job for the military. Do you think the police departments of New York City and Washington D.C. sent their homicide investigators to catch bin Laden and his al-Qaeda lieutenants to bring them to justice? \n\n \n I agree and disagree. In our own country we do not fire rockets into buildings to apprehend terror suspects.\n \n If the US taxpayer weren't giving money to Israel I would not care if Israel invaded and killed anybody. I have always been against liberals that want to give taxpayer money to people or other countries. Since this is happening, I feel obliged to speak up.\n \n In fact since 9-11 I think we should re-evaluate our liberal policies of foreign aid. It seems to cause us more trouble than not. Don't worry, Israel will not \"fall into the sea\".\n \n \n You must be joking or you're incredibly naive. Did the Taliban extradite bin Laden to the U.S.? For months Arafat has given shelter to dozens of wanted terrorists like Tawfik Tirawi in his Muqata presidential compound. What makes you think that Arafat will turn these people over merely because we ask? \n\n \n Did the Mexicans extradite the cop killer they have in custody? In fact they don't extradite any murderers. Should we invade Mexico? I think you are na\u00efve when you worry about Israel being pushed into the sea.\n \n \n Israel's missile attacks are targeted and discriminating. The 'indiscriminate' deaths are perpetrated by suicide bombers whose only goal is to randomly kill as many Jews as possible. \n\n \n Yah, accidents happen when you fire rockets from Apaches into apartments. \n \n \n\n These are not ordinary homicides. They are suicidal attacks perpetrated by enemy combatants. Even so, most of the time the IDF tries to arrest the target. The missile attacks are a last resort when no othere means is practical to take a terrorist into custody. Arrest attempts most often precipitate running gunfights that result in higher civilian casualties that targeted missile attacks. \n\n \n These rockets attacks happen right after a suicide attack. We don't do that here when we had the environmentalists arson fires here in CA. Or abortion clinic bombings or gang attacks. Where is the due process.\n \n \n I think the Israelis should continue to do what the Americans did in Yemen. You may recall the U.S. last year used a CIA predator aircraft to launch a Hellfire missile that struck a carload of al-Qaeda operatives. The six men killed included the chief planner of the suicide attack on the USS Cole. \n\n \n Like I said, I don't would care what they did if we did not give them taxpayer money. I also would revoke all strategic treaties around the globe, but that could take us off the topic.\n \n \n I doubt you heard the Israeli govn't say they prefer the term 'homicide bomber' over 'suicide bomber.' You might be confusing the Israelis with some of the folks in the Bush administration or on Fox News, but the Israeli govn't and media consistently using the term 'suicide bomber.' The thing that sets suicide bombers apart from other bombers who kill is their willingness to blow themselves up in the process. The former takes his own life in the process; hence, 'suicide bomber' is more apt.\n\n \n The use of the word homicide got me thinking about due process in the first place.

If Gaza and the West Bank are part of Israel they should, IMHO. What I suggest is give the Palestinians the West Bank and Gaza. There is an above ground road that connects the two sections. The Israelis do not want to do this because they have settlements in the West Bank. That is a problem. Who would get elected on that platform with settlements?\n \n I am not saying that if the Palestinians have a homeland everything will be great. There will be problems, but there would be hope for these citizens that feel \"second class\" in Israel.

But in cases of terrorism the US has a completely different policy.\n The September 11 attacks on the US led to us invading Afghanistan and removing a governmental system from power. We have carried out hundreds of missions searching for terrorists. We have a zero-tolerance for terrorism. We dropped bombs, and used missiles to destroy suspected terrorist hideouts. This all resulting in casulaties.\n During the \"war\" in Afghanistan we have seen hundreds of civilian casulaties during bombings. The same for Iraq, where our bombing led to the death of over 3,000 civilians. \n \n The US and Israel handle terrorism in the same mannor. Although Israel is a bit more restraint. \n For example: \n 1. \"Israeli officials said the attack failed because Israel used a smaller bomb to avoid harming civilians. In a July 2002 attack, a warplane dropped a one-ton bomb that killed its target - Hamas military leader Salah Shehadeh - but also 14 bystanders, among them several children, prompting an international outcry.\" \n 2. \" Referring to Saturday's failed hit on the Hamas leadership, the official said Sharon who was involved in the decision to use a smaller bomb and reduce collateral damage does not regret that decision. \n It is widely believed that Hamas' leaders would have been killed had a more powerful bomb been used. \"\n Sources: http://www.thedailycamera.com/bdc/nation_world_news/article/0,1713,BDC_2420_2240178,00.html\n http://209.157.64.200/focus/f-news/979053/posts\n \n How often do you think the US decides to use a \"smaller bomb\" to reduce civilian casulaties? The US uses its massive bombs in quality and quanitity:\n \"The US intends to shatter Iraq \"physically, emotionally and psychologically\" by raining down on its people as many as 800 cruise missiles in two days.\n The Pentagon battle plan aims not only to crush Iraqi troops, but also wipe out power and water supplies in the capital, Baghdad.\n It is based on a strategy known as \"Shock and Awe\", conceived at the National Defense University in Washington, in which between 300 and 400 cruise missiles would fall on Iraq each day for two consecutive days. It would be more than twice the number of missiles launched during the entire 40 days of the 1991 GulfWar.\n \"There will not be a safe place in Baghdad,\" a Pentagon official told America's CBS News after a briefing on the plan. \"The sheer size of this has never been seen before, never been contemplated before.\"\n Source: http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/01/25/1042911596206.html\n \n \n People live around each other and may not know who their neighbors are.\n \n \n The terrorists know who they are. They are aware the way Israel disposes of terrorist and the other casulaties that some of the disposing result in. Therfor common sense tells them that if they are around their family that their family is in danger of a missile strike.\n \n \n \nFirst off, let me say again our police do not shoot into crowds as the Israelis have from helicopters. \n \n \n See above comments...\n \n \n\"Israeli Apaches strafe the crowd with machinegun\n \n \n Although in all the time monitoring the Israel Palestinian situation ont he news (2 years) I have never heard of them just firing into a crowd I take your word for it and I condemn it very seriously.\n \n \nWhy not? \n \n \n Because these terrorists never go willingly. Besides the fact that the PA or PLO with leaders like Arafat would never allow it. They are willing to die as martyrs so lets get the job done for them.\n \n Let us suppose that Israel does arrest 3 or 4 terrorists. Where do they go on trial? \n Israel? Palestine? The anti-Israel UN? \n Should they be allowed to use up Israel tax dollars rotting away in jail, in a country thats economy is already poor?\n \n \nWhat I suggest is give the Palestinians the West Bank and Gaza. \n \n \n Why? Jordan is around 70% Palestine. There are close to a dozen Arab countries... (Egypt, Iran, Saudia Arabia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Jordan, Kuwait, etc...). There is one Jewish state which it seems many Arabs don't even like the idea of.\n \n Nothing short of destorying Israel would satisfy leaders such as Arafat.\n \n \nI am not saying that if the Palestinians have a homeland everything will be great.\n \n \n I only expect a peace for up to a year, with occasional attacks. Then I expect more frequent attacks followed by a claim for more land.\n Giving the terrorists another country to harbor them is a bad idea. \n \n \nWithin a decade or two I bet there would be peace with very few attacks that can be handled diplomatically. \n \n \n So until 10 or 20 years from now lets just let the terrorists continue their slaughtering? \n Thats a nice bet but nothing I would want to risk hundreds of civilians lives on. \n Especially if the terrorists ever get hold of a powerful weapon that could murder thousands if not millions.\n \n \nMaybe there should be a \"New Palestine\".\n \n \n Maybe but I'm not really fond of the idea.\n \n Thanks for reading this\n \n Always Stay Open Minded",

I will only say that the US supports Palestinians a lot. Lot's of cash goes to them. Whether from the US, Europe, or Muslim countries. We are talking about billions here. The US also is trying to help and end the conflict. It is not true that the US is arming Israel so it can attack Palestinians. That is simply not true.\n \n Anyways, why not do something that is simply right? Morally right that is. For example, won't you save a woman who is about to get raped, only because it might put you in danger?",

   "*Well, first of all, there are many Palestinian mothers who want their children to die for the cause.

There are kooks everywhere.\n \n \n* *Israel does the same thing with criminals in her country. The US bombs targets in Iraq and Afgan. without investigations. \n\n \n Yes, but we do not fire rockets into apartments in Washington DC (i.e. our own country). If we did, we would be breeding hatred much like any country that would.\n \n \n But this is where you're mistaken. The opposing side already took actions against us before we did anything wrong to it. Anyways, I did not understand how your comment was adressing the quote of mine. It just didn't seem (to me at least) to answer my quote. \n\n \n We have been supplying Israel with weapons and money for half a century. I do not remember a terrorist attack back in the 60's. \n \n Look back at the post; I was responding to your comment not answering a question.\n \n \n I don't know who Timothy McVays is so exccuse me for my ignorance. \n\n \n The Oklahoma City bomber.\n \n \n I don't think anyone wants to see innocent Palestinians die. But no one wants to see Israelis die either (especially Israel that wants to defend her people from dying). \n\n \n I am less concerned with either dying than I am with helping one side over the other.\n \n \n So you fear the support for Israel is putting your country at risk? \n\n \n I am against giving any country taxpayer money. The other day I was watching a show about Afghanistan. We give aid to Afghanistan that equals $150 per resident. We are being criticized because we give more money to Bosnia (over $300 per person). So if we give more money to Afghanistan, does that mean Iraq may feel short changed? So then we should give more money to Iraq. But then...\n \n \n I will only say that the US supports Palestinians a lot. Lot's of cash goes to them. \n\n \n There are people saying we should give the Palestinians more money too.

It is not true that the US is arming Israel so it can attack Palestinians. That is simply not true.\n \n\n \n Well we are arming Israel and they are using the weapons to kill Palestinians. We are resented for it.\n \n \n Anyways, why not do something that is simply right? \n\n \n What is right? Give poor mothers money or supply other countries with money? They all have negative effects that will eventually outweigh any benefits. Welfare breaks up families (because the mother can not receive money if she has a man that works live with her). One of the reasons Osama gave for 9-11 was our support for Israel. \n \n My point is: It may seem right at the time, but it really isn't in the long run.\n \n \n Morally right that is. For example, won't you save a woman who is about to get raped, only because it might put you in danger? \n\n \n Are you saying we should stop the killing of Palestinians? This works both ways.

I am being facetious; I am against giving other countries money.\n\n \n -I'll take that comment to be ignorance. The Palestinian culture, and that with Islam culture is about Jihad, Shahada. It's not just a few \"kook\" mothers. These are religious people who are willing to sacrifise their children. You might call it a culture of death. The videos I showed you are only but a few. I remember seeing many times, journalists interviewing families of suicide bombers. They all praised their sons and said they are very proud. Now, I'm not saying ALL Palestinians are that way. The moderate ones (who aren't as religious) don't want their children dying. But with many polls that show Palestinians supporting suicide bombers, it indicates a willing to die, and a willing to kill other people...\n \n -Israel doesn't fire rockets into Tel Aviv either. There were in the past Israeli Arabs who aided Palestinians with their actions. The Israeli military didn't shoot rockets into their buildings. You keep saying how Gaza to Israel is like Washington to the US. Why do you think that is comparable? The Palestinian territories are not Israeli territories. They are under Israel's control, yes. But as I said before. Israel didn't have control over 40% of the territories during the Oslo accords and 95% of the population. Why do you think Israel's police should take care of terrorists? Do you honestly believe the Israeli police can take care of organizations such as the Hamas, Al Aksa Brigades, Fatah and Islamic Jihad (not to mention the PA that has 45,000 \"police men\")?\n \n Of course the Israeli police cannot. Just like the US didn't send the FBI to Afghanistan to get bin Laden.....\n \n -Maybe you do not remember because you weren't born yet (me neither :) ), but there certainly were. During the 50's thousands of Israelis died from Palestinian terrorists. Go to this link: Which Came First - Terrorism or \"Occupation\"?. The Palestinians used to get on buses, shoot each and every Israeli and then run away. Today, only the tactics have changed a little.\n \n -I know you did. But I said this \"If someone threatens Israeli citizens, Israel has the right to defend herself with any means of weapons.\" and you replied with this \"We should not take sides in that war then. If we do we should expect the opposing side to take actions against us.\" You did not give me a good reason why Israel shouldn't \"take sides\" on this. How else is Israel going to defend herslef? Just sit back and let Palestinians do their thing?\n \n -Ok thanks. But that bomber wasn't supported by his family, nor by terrorist organizations and not by a form of government. Moreover, he came from within the US. There aren't others who are going to bomb the US right? Not regular citizens.....\n \n -Ok.\n \n -Well, that's a different discussion. Does the US have moral obligation to help other countries in need? I think so... Did you oppose the aid the US gave Europe after WW2 as a cause of the Cold War too?\n \n -Palestinians get lot's of money (for a people that don't have a country). Sad thing is, Arafat and his gang use much much of that money to their own bank accounts, and if that not, then to terrorists organizations. So you could say the US is giving Palestinians weapons to kill Israelis also. The UNRWA (body of UN that takes care of Palestinian refugees) had Jenin under their control (most of their money they get from the US). Look at what Jenin became? The capitol city for terrorists.\n \n -Ok. I understand where you stand. But you cannot ignore that money is going to the Palestinians, and into their terrorist organizations.\n \n -The US also gives the PA money, and it goes to terrorists. The US also tried to make peace. But yes, overall, Palestinians don't really like the US. Even though, I think they shouldn't be whining.\n \n -If the US didn't do that, Israel could've been whiped out by the Arabs. So in the short run, you got 4.5 million Israeli Jews who'd get massacred. I'm not saying that would actually happen. Perhaps Israel's economy would become more independant, and it would still be able to fight with superiority. That's what I ment by doing something right.\n \n -How do you what will happen in the \"long run\"? Bin Laden claims one of the reasons is Israel. But every Muslim country blaims Israel for everything (I mean it, everything). Israel is the Muslim's scapegoat. If Israel didn't exist, they would invent Israel!\n \n -No, I was saying that helping Israel could get you some backlash. But it would be the right thing to do. And BTW, during the war between Iraq and Iran they used people as human shields. They had tanks, helicopters, etc. The Iranians took children to walk over mine fields. Of course the children were keen to do so. What makes you think the Palestinians (who invented the human suicide machine) are different?",

Just like the US didn't send the FBI to Afghanistan to get bin Laden.....\n\n \n I think Israel should cede the Gaza and West Bank to the Palestinians. Until then they are firing rockets on their own territory. \n \n I am not saying there will not be anymore terrorist attacks BUT there will be fewer innocents killed by Israel. Fewer innocents killed over time will mean fewer terrorist attacks. Remember that recent attack where the girl blew herself up? That was in retaliation for killing her brother in a rocket attack.\n \n \n Maybe you do not remember because you weren't born yet (me neither :) ), but there certainly were.

The Palestinians used to get on buses, shoot each and every Israeli and then run away. Today, only the tactics have changed a little. \n \n \n I understand many people call Israel the \"state\" of Israel but in reality it is not part of the US.

Just sit back and let Palestinians do their thing? \n\n \n Israel defended herself before the heavy aid from the US came in. They still can.\n \n \n Ok thanks. But that bomber wasn't supported by his family, nor by terrorist organizations and not by a form of government. Moreover, he came from within the US. There aren't others who are going to bomb the US right? Not regular citizens..... \n\n \n You may think it is normal and not terrorist activity, but I don't. I don't particularly like government but I do not attend the meetings those guys did.\n \n \n Well, that's a different discussion. Does the US have moral obligation to help other countries in need? I think so... Did you oppose the aid the US gave Europe after WW2 as a cause of the Cold War too? \n\n \n If the US did not give taxpayer money away I would not be in this section of the forum. Just because the US gave money away after WWII does not justify us doing it now. You and I as private citizens can give our money away, but I would like to see the tax money \"giveaways\" stop.\n \n \n Palestinians get lot's of money (for a people that don't have a country). Sad thing is, Arafat and his gang use much much of that money to their own bank accounts, and if that not, then to terrorists organizations.

The UNRWA (body of UN that takes care of Palestinian refugees) had Jenin under their control (most of their money they get from the US). Look at what Jenin became? The capitol city for terrorists. \n\n \n The Palestinians are not the only ones that are corrupted by our money. I think money changes everyone that gets it. The Israelis get so much money they can wage wars like any first-world country. \n \n \n Ok. I understand where you stand. But you cannot ignore that money is going to the Palestinians, and into their terrorist organizations.\n \n -The US also gives the PA money, and it goes to terrorists. The US also tried to make peace. But yes, overall, Palestinians don't really like the US. Even though, I think they shouldn't be whining. \n\n \n Why should they? We really don't support them. We give everyone money. That doesn't mean these people will be our friends. This is why I say we should not give taxpayer money to anyone.\n \n \n If the US didn't do that, Israel could've been whiped out by the Arabs. So in the short run, you got 4.5 million Israeli Jews who'd get massacred. I'm not saying that would actually happen. Perhaps Israel's economy would become more independant, and it would still be able to fight with superiority. That's what I ment by doing something right. \n\n \n Israel does not need our help. They fought off invasions long before we aided them. Now they are even more likely to win.\n \n \n How do you what will happen in the \"long run\"? Bin Laden claims one of the reasons is Israel. But every Muslim country blaims Israel for everything (I mean it, everything). Israel is the Muslim's scapegoat. If Israel didn't exist, they would invent Israel! \n\n \n How do I know? No one knows for sure but we have done it YOUR way for half a century and the violence is still happening and so did 9-11. Your method did and does not prevent these atrocities. I think it is time to change our policy.\n \n \n No, I was saying that helping Israel could get you some backlash. But it would be the right thing to do. And BTW, during the war between Iraq and Iran they used people as human shields. They had tanks, helicopters, etc. The Iranians took children to walk over mine fields. Of course the children were keen to do so. What makes you think the Palestinians (who invented the human suicide machine) are different?\n\n \n I really don't care about other countries. Our CIA gave money to Saddam while he was in exile and we supported and even helped him come to power. This is the type of things we should not do. \n \n Our support of the Shah in Iran caused us to lose relations with that country for decades. Manuel Noriega, Marcos, and the Taliban: It seems like we put money and support into some of the cruelest dictators in the world. This should stop. We should be conservative with the taxpayer money also.\n \n You are a great debater Mad. Thanks for responding.",

   "Interesting Chuffy. That really complicates the problem.\n \n \n \n On nightline tonight they were discussing the Israeli pilots that are refusing to fire on Palestinians. 37 of them signed a petition. They say that these attacks are \"counterproductive\" and are creating resentment. \n \n Other leaders in Israel are starting to question these targeted killings.\n \n This is some information from Nightline:\n \n The Pilots say there is an order that says, \"We should not obey an illegal order\". One of the signers is a General. Other signers include Colonels. They claim this type of war perpetuates the violence. They say after each of their attacks there are attacks against Israel. These men are real patriots; they really care about Israel.\n \n Israelis have killed 75 innocent people since September, while killing 68 \"militants\". \n \n There is a population explosion by the Palestinians. Palestinian women have an average of more than 6 kids. Israeli women have only 2 kids.\n \n 55% of Israel is Jewish right now. Avrahgm Burg of the Knesset is concerned and wants to separate Israel and make a separate Palestinian State. President Bush is the first President to call for a separate Palestinian State (wow, I did not know that). Also, Jewish Immigration is down to only about 30,000 a year now. \n \n Most Israelis want to have a Democracy AND also want to have a Jewish State. In a matter of a couple decades this will change if the Palestinians do not get their own country.",
