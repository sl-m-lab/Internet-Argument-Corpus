   "Do people go to hell if they lie?\n \n I was pumping gas today, and I noticed a sticker on the pump warning me that security cameras were monitoring my actions and my license plate number. It was kind of an old station, it had a leaky roof over the pump, I looked around for a place where I camera might be, I didn't see any. So after I paid I walked in and asked about it, I knew the owner of the place pretty well, he told me that there was no security camera but that just having the sticker reduces gas theft. He was also amused, because he had totally forgotten that he put that sticker there. The sticker is a lie to anybody that gets gas at his station, but he will no doubt forget its there again, and never give much thought to it. will he go to hell when he dies because he will never feel the least bit bad for this lie?",

   "I would think that the owner would be fooling the public in this case...but, technically, a lie is still a lie.\n \n If all it takes is a lie to go to hell I think hell's in for more than it bargained for, which may or may not upset Ol' Luke depending on where he plans on keeping folks and in what manner.\n \n But who is a liar? A pathological liar may believe what he lying about and there's no way for regular liars to prove otherwise. It takes a good bit of logic to be a good liar if you think about it. The prefrontal cortex is more active when regular liars lie, but there's more \"white matter\" (\"white matter\" facilitates sharp, complex thinking while \"gray matter\" sorts out inhibitions) in the cortex when it comes to sophisticated liars - those that tell a lie and \"make it work\". If I'm not mistaken there's research going on that seeks to use that \"white matter\" activity instead of the polygraph.\n \n I'm going a little beyond the scope of the question, but it really depends on the lie, imho. For example, if I said I saw a 14-point buck charging through my food plot towards my stand, when it was only a spike, then in my opinion, I'd just be begging for praise. Yes, it would still be a lie, but not one that would get me a free ride to hell. Sort of the same thing for the station owner.\n \n Then there's the altruistic liars who feel it necessary to put others' wishes/wants/desires/needs before their own. This is usually done through some system created to demonstrate the value of a relationship. Some people use these types of lies to communicate to loved ones when other methods fail. Despite my own feelings, I think it might be considered a virtue to be a liar. When I was in high school my football coach told me that I was one of the best hustlers he'd ever seen on special teams. He lied...but did so to his and the team's benefit. I used that lie to improve my game, which is why he said it in the first place. He was a good coach.",

What do you mean by \"theoretical science\"? Exactly what are you looking for?\n \n \nSupposition. Bring forth evidence that Behe does\n\n Wait, you're actually denying this? You're right, you really don't know much about this...\n Q (Rothschild): And using your definition, intelligent design is a scientific theory, correct?\n \n A (Behe): Yes.\n \n Q Under that same definition astrology is a scientific theory under your definition, correct?\n \n A Under my definition, a scientific theory is a proposed explanation which focuses or points to physical, observable data and logical inferences. There are many things throughout the history of science which we now think to be incorrect which nonetheless would fit that -- which would fit that definition. Yes, astrology is in fact one, and so is the ether theory of the propagation of light, and many other -- many other theories as well.\n \n Q The ether theory of light has been discarded, correct?\n \n A That is correct.\n \n Q But you are clear, under your definition, the definition that sweeps in intelligent design, astrology is also a scientific theory, correct?\n \n A Yes, that's correct...\nNow, do I need to find the quote where Fuller says science should be redefined, or do you now understand that these people are such crackpots that I don't need to make up stuff about them?\n \n \nI'm not here to show that ID-theory is wrong. But I'm interested in what you call 'science'.\n\n You could try reading the hundreds and hundreds of pages of transcripts and evidence from McLean v. Arkansas, where many scientists discussed the definition of science. Or you could just read Overton's decision to get a decent idea. An even better source would be Karl Popper.\n \n \nThat's not what I'm meaning here at all. You are the one who differentiated between 'non-science' and 'disproven science'\n\n Right. Science, for example, has to be testable. Science lacks the ability to test the supernatural. The only things scientists can control with their experiments or deduce about their findings have to do with natural characteristics. Science cannot test the claim \"Goddidit.\" This in no way proves that God didn't do it; science is simply incapable of drawing conclusions either way. Another important aspect of science is that it's falsifiable. That is, the hypothesis must conceptually be subject to falsification. For example, the claim that \"God made it that way\" is not falsifiable. (Or in the case of ID, \"An unknown entity at an unknown time using an unknown mechanism performed an unknown action or actions to produce some things\" is as unfalsifiable as it is vacuous.) \n \n Here's the continuation of Behe's response above:... And let me explain under my definition of the word \"theory,\" it is -- a sense of the word \"theory\" does not include the theory being true, it means a proposition based on physical evidence to explain some facts by logical inferences. There have been many theories throughout the history of science which looked good at the time which further progress has shown to be incorrect. Nonetheless, we can't go back and say that because they were incorrect they were not theories. So many many things that we now realized to be incorrect, incorrect theories, are nonetheless theories.\nHis asinine definition of \"theory\" aside, he's right about scientific ideas being disproven not rendering them unscientific. Before we had much evidence about astronomy, most people felt that the universe was steady-state. But as the evidence came in, it became clear that this was not the case. Was the steady-state idea suddenly unscientific, or suddenly disproven? Only the latter. We don't teach it because it's clearly false, not because it's not science.\n \n \nSo I asked you about what you meant. What about science that can't be proven. Is it still science? (that's what I asked, and gave an example of 'theoretical science')\n\n I've already told you that science can't technically prove anything.\n And no, you provided the example of \"theoretical science\" without giving any explanation of what \"theoretical science\" is. I took a stab at it with string theory, but apparently I guessed incorrectly.\n \n \nExcept that they are reviewed by their peers. It's just that their peers are, according to you 'nuts'.\n\n Okay, I thought I called you on this equivocation before, but apparently I changed my mind and didn't use the word. So here I will: Stop the equivocation. \"Peer review\" means review by numerous other qualified scientists, not any review by a person who happens to be an immediate peer. If these people were true scientists as they claim to be, they wouldn't have a problem with this standard process.\n In science, one doesn't get to choose her reviewers. She sends her paper to a journal, and the journal runs it by their editors and experts, and sends copies to several qualified professionals not affiliated with the journal in order for them to review it. The decision is then made whether the article is worthy of printing, needs changes, or is rejected outright.\n \n \nGiven that this totally ignores the fact that Crick has been 'peer-reviewed' with regards exobiology (see \"directed panspermia\") the objection you place is rather selective.\n\n It doesn't ignore Crick's idea of directed panspermia at all. I take it you're not aware of the Behe & Snoke paper? ID proponents (especially Behe) cite it repeatedly because it passed review, but it makes no mention of ID or irreducible complexity; it simply presents a very unrealistic model for the evolution of \"complex\" structures (and it just so happens that his own paper does such a lousy job of supporting his assertion that \"complex\" structures are highly unlikely to evolve). (And of course, this was done in Protein Science, a journal not nearly as concerned with evolution as others.. Why didn't Behe and Snoke submit the paper to Nature, or Science?) (And of course, Protein Science later published an article that gave scathing critique of the methodology, too.) You see, just because an article is published doesn't mean it has gained the support of a huge part of the scientific community.\n We conclude that it is possible that life reached the earth in this way, but that the scientific evidence is inadequate at the present time to say anything about the probability. We draw attention to the kinds of evidence that might throw additional light on the topic.\nDoes this mean that all the reviewers must has also thought that Directed Panspermia was true? No, they simply felt the article was worth publishing, or at least saw no reason to reject it (possibly like Behe & Snoke's paper, even though the model therein was ridiculous).\n But, gee, if you think that this bar is too low, and the DI cronies still can't jump it, what exactly does that say about ID?\n \n \nGiven you don't seem to know what science is, and you're the one stating HERE that ID-theory isn't, then you need be aware of where YOU are posting.\n\n [looks above] ... Uh.. I'm the one in this conversation who has no clue about science? Try again.\n Yes, I can state here that ID is not science, especially since the Disco Institute came up; I am not restricted to making statements that are related directly to only religion (although one could certainly argue that ID is directly related to religion), and neither are you. However, you want an explicit discussion about the nature or definition of science, and that desire would be better served by starting a thread in the science and math forum.\n \n \nIn short you object based on 'peer review'. This is unstuck by the fact that they are peer reviwed. Whether their peers are all nuts or not is irrelevant. As is the fact that people like Crick are also 'peer reviewed' but believe in directed panspermia (which sems to pass you by).\n\n In short you are lying. In fact, my objection is that ID as a whole does not fit the criteria of being science. In fact, you are equivocating the meaning of \"peer review\" in the context of science with \"review by ones immediate peers.\" In fact, the Behe & Snoke paper passed, too.\n Glad to see you've already come to your conclusions regardless of what you've been told.\n \n \nAlso you waffle on about Behe and astrology.\n\n Again, it was silly of me to think you had the slightest familiarity with the subject. Regardless, Behe and the DI cronies, just as I said, want a new definition of science so that ID can be \"science.\" I have provided the evidence of such.\n \n \nAnd you go on about 'disproven science' when I ask you about science that has no proofs.\n\n Proofs are for math and liquor. Science doesn't do \"proof.\" How many times do I have to explain this, anyway?",

   "Theoretical science is that science which deals solely with theory. It therefore can not be subject to 'experimentation' in any real world sense.\n\n Nice. I ask you to define \"theoretical science\" and you respond with \"science which deals solely with theory.\" Evidently you're using \"theory\" in a different way than scientists do. So, once again, if you'll provide a coherent definition, I'll answer your question.\n \n \nNot at all, but had you sourced your material in the first place it would have been better.\n\n Like I said, I shouldn't have presumed you knew what you were talking about.\n \n \nEvolution is considered science because it follows 'the scientific method'.\n\n You're leaving out a lot.

Crick believes aliens might have sent the building blocks of life to earth. Has he discovered wreckage from spaceships?\n\n \"Conclusions?\" I suggest you read the paper. It explores the issue of the origin of life considering recently discovered (at the time) astronomical and biological information. Their three pieces of evidence seem to be:\n 1. Lack of other explanation -- which we now have\n 2. Biological importance of rare elements -- an argument which the paper completely fails to support\n 3. (Almost) Universal genetic code -- which is explained by common ancestry\n See also below.\n \n \nSomeone needs to control their anger. Medication?\n\n I need medication when I'm right? You're putting words in my mouth; why not pills, too?\n \n \nLOL! Oh great teacher, I've failed to 'learn my lesson' ROFL.\n\n Even the best teacher is limited when a student doesn't know the difference between math and science and the difference between astronomy and astrology. Add to that the fact that you think I've said what I haven't and think I haven't said what I have. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable if I just stopped objecting to your providing my half of the dialogue as well as your own? You don't seem to need me here...\n \n \nWhen I ask for clarification, simply you repeating yourself is not 'explaining' your point, but repeating it.\n\n I can't clarify because your question makes no sense. I repeatedly tell you that science doesn't do proof. You continue to ask me about \"science that can't be proven.\" That's all science, so your question clearly does not articulate what your intended question is. Ask a question that makes sense, and you have a better chance of getting an answer.\n \n \nLet's deal with exobiology as science.\n\n Let's discuss astrobiology instead.Although astrobiology is an emerging field, the question of whether life exists elsewhere in the universe is a verifiable hypothesis and thus a valid line of scientific inquiry. Astrobiology does not claim to be a pure scientific discipline in the sense of physics or biology but rather represents an effort by researchers in different disciplines to attempt answers to questions about life by drawing on knowledge of multiple scientific fields. Since we have only one example of a planet teeming with life most work is speculative, educated guesses based on fundamental laws of physics, (bio-)chemistry, and our current understanding of biology.\nIn fact, just read the article yourself to understand the controversy over astrobiology's status as \"science.\"\n \n \nExobiologists have stated that Type-II and Type-III civilizations are the most likely to take part in interstellar travel. They are 'peer reviewed'. What experiments have they done to conclude that Type-I civilizations are less likely to be spacemen?\n\n Sounds like you're still not appealing to Popper or even Overton.\n I'm not an astrobiologist, nor am I very familiar with astrobiology. If I had to guess, the reasoning is that interstellar travel would take incredible amounts of energy, and only civilizations with enough energy to use for interstellar travel could do so.
