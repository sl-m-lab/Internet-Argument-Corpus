Because The crimianals won't give up their guns! *gasp*\n I would also quote some of the stuff that Abbadon660 has posted but the quote would be so long that none of you would read this!\n But seriously, check out what abbadon and what dutchdon have to say.",

   "If you are for gun control because you think it saves lives think again. This false hood has never been more evident than with the Massachusetts Bartley Fox laws enacted in the early 70's. Homicide rates dropped by approximately 32% after Bartley fox was enacted on the surface it looked like gun control works and this is what the public was lead to believe. Unless you had read the law and it's requirements, you would know that the opposite was true. \n \n Before Bartley Fox there was only and FID (Firearms Identification Card) required to possess or buy a pistol. After Bartley Fox was the same except you needed at the least a letter from your chief of police (allowing you to buy and transport a pistol to your property and an F.I.D card or an LTC (Lic. to carry) a pistol. Bartley Fox required anyone who wanted to take a pistol off their property for what ever reason to have a LTC. Which allowed you to carry a gun concealed. Almost everyone who had a pistol at that time applied for the Lic. and got it. Since the law stated that if you applied for the Lic. the Lic. Authority shall issue the Lic. unless there were a legal reason such as felony etc. that prevented you from owning a gun. \n \n In 1972 after Bartley Fox you all of a sudden had a massive influx of private citizens legality carrying concealed handguns. Surprise homicides dropped. The LTC. had a line on it that stated \"Reason for Issue\" this line filled out with one of two reasons 1. Hunting and Target or 2. Protection of Person and Property. The way that the law was written it made no difference what the lic. Said a LTC was an LTC and that was that.\n \n In the late 70's a lawsuit changed Bartley Fox. A citizen was arrested for having a loaded concealed handgun with an LTC that was for Hunting and Target. The arresting officer and DA thought that was wrong and procicuted the case and won, changing the law. After this Homicides rose to more than 1 a day in Mass. because most lic. at that point were for H&T. and also gave the Lic. Authority some control over the pistol owning public allowing them to issue, fulfilling the shall issue but controlling who actually carried for protection. So now they could actually prevent people from carrying a loaded handgun for protection. Before it didn't matter what the lic. Said now it did. H&T lic. were still allowed to carry the gun concealed only it had to be unloaded.\n \n In the late 80's the law changed again H&T and the protection reason for issue were replaced by the line All Lawful Purposes again the law went back to its origins. Again now anyone with the LTC was legal to carry a concealed handgun for protection and as before homicides dropped. And as before the LIC. Authority was left with no control.\n \n In the late 90's the laws changed once more changing shall issue to may issue. Again the lic. Authority again was able to control who could carry and who couldn't and guess what you got it homicides are again on the rise in MASS. Go figure..\n \n Conclusion: gun control kills....",

If you're trying to argue that the public was more armed in Germany before gun legalization than after then please present the evidence.\n\n \n Well if you're trying to make the argument that the Jewish population of Germany was actually armed at the time of them being rounded up like cattle, herded into the backs of trucks, relocated to the concentration camps and killed, then you'd better have some very good evidence to back up this claim.\n \n \nMy very next sentence was \"Then they do things like lobby Congress to reduce the budget of the ATF...\" \n In other words, I was saying that if the ATF is underfunded then it will be harder for them to catch the criminals and thus it will less likely that criminals will be punished.

What they're currently doing has almost absolutely nothing to do with fighting crime or catching criminals. They're doing two things currently: tracing guns for the police, and inspecting FFL dealers.\n \n Here's the thing about the second thing. The ATF has the authority to revoke a seller's license for paperwork errors. An example of a paperwork error that they can revoke a license for would be abbreviating your state of residence, such as putting AZ instead of Arizona, or if you put your social security number down with all 10 numbers together instead of hypenating them.\n \n Now you tell me this.

Of course, I wasn't expecting anyone to support gun control based on those facts alone.\n\n \n The strategy that you are talking about is used by the anti gun side almost exclusively. Even with your facts the difference in the numbers is insignificant. To compare one nation to another or even state-to-state which is dishonest at best, but is what the anti's regularly do. Since the laws governing guns, crime and punishment not to mention criminals are different even to the point of being radically different. Here's just one example; given that Europe has less homicides than the US, Europe also has less violent criminals than the US. Europe doesn't have a porous border with a corrupt third world country that violent criminals cross-unimpeded as does the US. Also Europe doesn't have thousands of violent gangs as does the US. Here are just a few (AB) Arian Brotherhood, Skin Heads, Latin Kings, MS-13, Mongols, Hells Angles, Bloods, and Crips, just to name a few. These gangs use violence and murder as just a regular part of doing business.\n \n Only a very few countries actually have criminal rights. In most countries you are guilty till you prove your innocents, you have no Miranda rights, no right to an attorney, also other countries you don't have a justice system where a criminal can kill someone serve 5 years and be out to kill again.\n \n \nGun registration came with gun legalization. If you're trying to argue that the public was more armed in Germany before gun legalization than after then please present the evidence.\n\n \n Whether they were more armed before or after it makes no difference after Hitler and the Nazis came to power they used the registration to disarm all those who were not Nazis. Like the Jews. \n \n \n \nMy very next sentence was \"Then they do things like lobby Congress to reduce the budget of the ATF...\" \n In other words, I was saying that if the ATF is under funded then it will be harder for them to catch the criminals and thus it will less likely that criminals will be punished. I think that shows that I do not advocate leaving the criminals alone.\n\n \n ATF doesn't catch criminals they make them. They are not a real law enforcement agency. Their scope in law enforcement is very limited. And they as many other agencies are over funded. \n \n \n \n \nActually, I have fired an NFA gun before \n\n \n Firing one doesn't make you knowledgeable about NFA.",

   "\"A more farfetched question is the hypothetical proposition of armed Jewish resistance. First, they were not commonly armed even prior to the 1928 Law.

   "If you'd kept up on the news you'd know that investigators have been able to sneak bomb components right through security, and as the old adage goes \"once is too much\". So obviously all the security in the world isn't going to work.\n \n And here's something else to think about. These security checkpoints, they tell you to get there two hours ahead of schedule so you can wait in a long line as everybody is checked. What's to stop a suicide bomber with a bomb strapped to their chest from running into this line and dentonating themselves and killing everybody present?\n \n Don't try and turn my statement against me, I've already proven why gun control doesn't work. I applied the logic of gun control to other things, proving that it's absolutely impossible. \n \n By gun control logic the best way to stop the spread of disease is to kill every last human being.\n \n By gun control logic the best way to stop plane hijackings is to ban all air travel, even commercial shipment.\n \n By gun control logic the best way to stop dogfighting is to outlaw dog ownership.\n\n So do you seriously advocate that there be no security checks at airports? You can come up with analogies all day long but that doesn't mean you've proved your point. What you really have to ask yourself is how valid your analogies are. People like you sure object when people on the other side of the debate compare guns to WMDs but you think it's okay to compare guns to human beings, air travel, and dog ownership.",
