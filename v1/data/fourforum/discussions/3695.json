   "My favorite comic and a legend in his own time, George Carlin, speaks his mind on religion:\n \n When it comes to bullsh*t, big-time, major league bullsh*t, you have to stand in awe of the all-time champion of false promises and exaggerated claims, religion. No contest. No contest. Religion. Religion easily has the greatest bullsh*t story ever told. Think about it. Religion has actually convinced people that there's an invisible man living in the sky who watches everything you do, every minute of every day. And the invisible man has a special list of ten things he does not want you to do. And if you do any of these ten things, he has a special place, full of fire and smoke and burning and torture and anguish, where he will send you to live and suffer and burn and choke and scream and cry forever and ever 'til the end of time!\n \n But He loves you.\n \n He loves you, and He needs money!\n \n He always needs money! He's all-powerful, all-perfect, all-knowing, and all-wise, somehow just can't handle money! Religion takes in billions of dollars, they pay no taxes, and they always need a little more. Now, you talk about a good bullsh*t story. Holy Sh*t!\n \n My response:\n \n I am not an Athiest like Carlin, so I do not think in quite the same manner, but we do share the same view on organized religion, which I think Carlin is mainly talking about.\n \n I happen to believe that a higher power exists and is mostly likely responsible for everything that science has explained and that which has not yet been uncovered. I do not believe that any organized religion is legitimate nor required to live a moral, honest life.",
