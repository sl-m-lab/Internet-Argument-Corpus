   "SUMMARY: Stephen Dunne failed the exam by two points, but nonetheless represents himself in a federal lawsuit claiming Massachusetts promotes a \"homosexual agenda.\"\n \n A man said he failed the Massachusetts bar exam because he refused to answer a question about same-sex marriage, and claims in a federal lawsuit the test violated his rights and targeted his religious beliefs. \n \n The suit also challenges the constitutionality of same-sex marriage, which was legalized in Massachusetts in 2003. \n \n Stephen Dunne, who is representing himself in the case and seeks $9.75 million, said the bar exam was not the place for a \"morally repugnant and patently offensive\" question addressing the rights of two married lesbians, their children and their property. He said he refused to answer the question because he believed it legitimized same-sex marriage and same-sex parenting, which is contrary to his moral beliefs. \n \n Dunne, 30, was denied a license to practice law in May after scoring 268.866 on the exam, just shy of the 270 passing grade. \n \n His lawsuit against the Massachusetts Board of Bar Examiners and the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court also claims the state government is \"purposely advancing secular humanism's homosexual agenda.\" \n \n The \"disguised mechanism to screen applicants according to their political ideology has the discriminatory impact of persecuting and oppressing (Dunne's) sincere religious practices and beliefs\" protected by the First Amendment, and was \"invasive and burdensome,\" according to the lawsuit filed last month. \n \n Dunne's telephone number was unlisted. He told the Boston Herald he has a law degree from a Boston law school and is attending a Boston business school. \n \n Officials with the state bar would not say how much the questions are worth or how the tests are scored, and the court also declined to comment. \n \n David Yas, editor of Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly, said the suit was \"idiotic\" and that Dunne was \"completely missing the point about what it means to be a lawyer.\" \n \n \"Knowing the law has nothing to do with agreeing with the law,\" Yas said. He said that if Dunne really believes the question was improper, he should \"answer the question correctly, get your law degree and use it to argue for what you believe in.\" \n \n Lee Swislow, executive director of Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders, said Dunne is trying to use a legal question to advance a political agenda. \n \n \"The bar exam was a test of whether he knew how to apply domestic relations law, and he refused to answer,\" she said. \"Now he's suing, and I think that makes him a loser.\" (Erin Conroy, AP) \n http://news.yahoo.com/s/po/20070707/co_po/massbarflunkerwants975million",

Maybe if he had prefaced it with \"Jesus said, ...\", you would have just swallowed it whole while still having no clue what was said... :xbanghead \n \n This guy is complaining that the law recognizing gay marriage, and the test acknowledging the law's recognition of gay marriage is a violation of his religious beliefs.\n \n That argument cuts both ways.\n Likewise, I could argue that the state I am in NOT recognizing gay marriage is a violation of MY religious beliefs.\n \n But with some Christians, they are so arrogant they seem to think THEIR religious beliefs are the only ones that count...\n \n \n \nAnd yet, you will see it come to pass. \n\n One of the boring, yet psychologically morbidly fascinating, is the pretense of some Christians to just make some absolutely stupid #### up, and then pretend that it is not complete fiction.\n Often they will try to pretend that their statement is in somehow predicted or justified by the bible. Like with the pretense that the earth had to be the center of the galaxy.\n And yet when they are proven wrong, they quickly change their dogma, but not the fundamental error which created the error in the first place.\n \n Archie has no basis for claiming that our society will be \"completely destroyed\" if gay marriage is allowed. At face value, it's obviously a ludicrous statement.\n Yet it doesn't stop him from passing it off as an absolute. And when it doesn't come to pass, he'll just change his story, but not the flawed thinking which lead to the mistake in the first place.\n It's really rather fascinating.",

You don't want anyone telling you you're wrong and supporting it with moral principles so like typical philosophical cowards you attack and insult them.

Matt's reasoning DOES make perfect sense.\n You just need some common sense to REALIZE what Matt was arguing in the first place. emoticon_rolleyes \n 2) I said we COULD argue that. The COULD should have been your indicator that we WERE NOT arguing that.\n 3) I said SOME Christians, and my point was completely valid.\n The whole point of this was to point out the inherent contradiction of the supposed standard, and how it obviously is nonsensical.\n Except I guess even that just can't make sense to somebody like you who thrives on nonsense.\n \n Matt and I demonstrate the flaws in somebody else's arguments by showing a counter-argument with the SAME INITIAL SUPPOSITION, and you can't realize the true intent of it all.\n \n Seriously Archie.

It was heard by a judge in a two day trial and a decision was made by the Judge who charged the plaintiff with Court Costs and may make him pay the Korean Couples Legal Fees.\n \n Verdict Reached In $54 Million Pants Lawsuit\n \n Judge Sides With Dry Cleaner\n \n POSTED: 8:52 am PDT June 25, 2007\n UPDATED: 12:15 pm PDT June 25, 2007\n \n WASHINGTON -- A judge ruled Monday in favor of a dry cleaner that was sued for $54 million over a missing pair of pants.\n The owners of Custom Cleaners did not violate the city's consumer protection law by failing to live up to Roy L. Pearson's expectations of the \"Satisfaction Guaranteed\" sign once displayed in the store window, District of Columbia Superior Court Judge Judith Bartnoff ruled.\n \"A reasonable consumer would not interpret 'Satisfaction Guaranteed' to mean that a merchant is required to satisfy a customer's unreasonable demands\" or to agree to demands that the merchant would have reasonable grounds for disputing, the judge wrote.\n \n Bartnoff ordered Pearson to pay the court costs of defendants Soo Chung, Jin Nam Chung and Ki Y. Chung.\n Pearson, an administrative law judge, originally sought $67 million from the Chungs, claiming they lost a pair of trousers from a blue and maroon suit, then tried to give him a pair a pair of charcoal gray pants that he said were not his. He arrived at the amount by adding up years of alleged law violations and almost $2 million in common law fraud claims.\n Bartnoff wrote, however, that Pearson failed to prove that the pants the dry cleaner tried to return were not the pants he taken in for alterations.\n Pearson later dropped demands for damages related to the pants and focused his claims on signs in the shop, which have since been removed.\n \n The court costs amount to just over $1,000 for photocopying, filing and similar expenses, according to the Chungs' attorney. A motion to recover the Chungs' tens of thousands of dollars in attorney fees will be considered later.\n Chris Manning, the Chungs' attorney, praised the ruling, which followed a two-day trial earlier this month.\n \"Judge Bartnoff has spoken loudly in suggesting that, while consumers should be protected, abusive lawsuits like this will not be tolerated,\" Manning said in a statement. \"Judge Bartnoff has chosen common sense and reasonableness over irrationality and unbridled venom.\"\n Pearson did not immediately respond to a call and an e-mail seeking comment.",

   "Seems Mr. Dunne put up a fund-raising web-site for his efforts on his law-suit, and it also was taken down. (Not sure why on either account...)\n \n Google has a cache version of it.\n Enjoy the emoticon_frazzled read!\n My name is Stephen Dunne and I have filed a lawsuit against the Supreme Court of Massachusetts alleging that the Massachusetts Bar Examination discriminates against my sincere Christian practices and beliefs. I failed the Massachusetts Bar Examination because I refused to affirmatively accept, support, and promote Homosexual Marriage and Homosexual Parenting.\n \n My dream is to become a Lawyer, but I cannot defile my Christian faith simply to pass an examination. I will not pay the price that the Defendants are forcing me to pay in order to practice law in Massachusetts. There is no price tag on my faith. It is not for sale.\n \n After a great deal of deliberation, prayer and introspection, I decided to vindicate my constitutional rights in Federal District Court. On June 25, 2007, I filed a Federal Complaint challenging the inclusion of the question regarding Homosexual Marriage and Homosexual Parenting on the Massachusetts Bar Examination. Furthermore, I am challenging the constitutionality of Homosexual Marriage and Homosexual Parenting in Massachusetts. In 2003, four unelected judges legalized Homosexual Marriage in Goodridge v. Dept. of Public Health, 798 N.E. 2d 941 (Mass. 2003). I sincerely believe that this ruling is profoundly undemocratic and un-American.\n \n I have preemptively fired the first shot that has been heard around the world. An Army of Liberal Lawyers led by the Massachusetts Attorney General stand at the ready to dismiss this lawsuit as quickly as possible. If I am to successfully challenge the constitutionality of Homosexual Marriage and Homosexual Parenting in Massachusetts, it will be because of the generosity, support and conviction of my fellow Americans. I cannot overlook the passage in Matthew 10:16: \"I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves.\" With that passage in mind, I plan on hiring America's #1 Law Firm to help me win this case. Justice is expensive in America, but with your support it can be realized. Litigation expenses, expert witnesses, court costs and legal fees associated with legal research are only a sampling of the costs that must be paid to guarantee victory and protect the faith of the Founding Fathers of this beautiful Country.

   "Seems Mr. Dunne put up a fund-raising web-site for his efforts on his law-suit, and it also was taken down. (Not sure why on either account...)\n \n Google has a cache version of it.\n Enjoy the emoticon_frazzled read!\n My name is Stephen Dunne and I have filed a lawsuit against the Supreme Court of Massachusetts alleging that the Massachusetts Bar Examination discriminates against my sincere Christian practices and beliefs. I failed the Massachusetts Bar Examination because I refused to affirmatively accept, support, and promote Homosexual Marriage and Homosexual Parenting.\n \n My dream is to become a Lawyer, but I cannot defile my Christian faith simply to pass an examination. I will not pay the price that the Defendants are forcing me to pay in order to practice law in Massachusetts. There is no price tag on my faith. It is not for sale.\n \n After a great deal of deliberation, prayer and introspection, I decided to vindicate my constitutional rights in Federal District Court. On June 25, 2007, I filed a Federal Complaint challenging the inclusion of the question regarding Homosexual Marriage and Homosexual Parenting on the Massachusetts Bar Examination. Furthermore, I am challenging the constitutionality of Homosexual Marriage and Homosexual Parenting in Massachusetts. In 2003, four unelected judges legalized Homosexual Marriage in Goodridge v. Dept. of Public Health, 798 N.E. 2d 941 (Mass. 2003). I sincerely believe that this ruling is profoundly undemocratic and un-American.\n \n I have preemptively fired the first shot that has been heard around the world. An Army of Liberal Lawyers led by the Massachusetts Attorney General stand at the ready to dismiss this lawsuit as quickly as possible. If I am to successfully challenge the constitutionality of Homosexual Marriage and Homosexual Parenting in Massachusetts, it will be because of the generosity, support and conviction of my fellow Americans. I cannot overlook the passage in Matthew 10:16: \"I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves.\" With that passage in mind, I plan on hiring America&#8217;s #1 Law Firm to help me win this case. Justice is expensive in America, but with your support it can be realized. Litigation expenses, expert witnesses, court costs and legal fees associated with legal research are only a sampling of the costs that must be paid to guarantee victory and protect the faith of the Founding Fathers of this beautiful Country.

   "Maybe the point has hit home; that by using religious beliefs as a bases for a law suit he opens up the possibility of others using their opposite religious beliefs as a bases of a law suit.\n\n Haha\n If that's what happened, I would love to have seen the look on his face as that was explained to him.\n \n \n On another note, here's the question that was actually on the bar exam that prompted his hissy fit.\n Mary and Jane, both attorneys, were married two years ago in Massachusetts.\n \n The day before their marriage, Mary and Jane each fully disclosed their assets to the other and signed an antenuptial agreement (the \"Agreement\") in which each of them agreed that if they were ever divorced (i) they would divide any joint marital property evenly, (ii) they would not seek or accept any property that the other brought into the marriage, and (iii) they would not seek or accept child support or alimony from the other. The Agreement was drafted and reviewed by an attorney representing Jane. Mary did not hire an attorney to review the Agreement as she \"trusted Jane.\"\n \n At the time of the marriage Jane had a two year old adopted child, Philip, and Mary was three months pregnant. When Mary gave birth in Boston six months later to Charles, Mary and Jane were listed on his birth certificate as his parents. Mary has treated and referred to Philip as her son, although she did not adopt him. Mary, Jane, Philip and Charles lived in a house in Boston owned by both Mary and Jane. The down payment for this house came only from Mary.\n \n Jane was the sole supporter of the family, while Mary stayed at home taking care of Philip and Charles. Mary had no savings, while Jane had over a million dollars in savings from an inheritance that she received when her mother died three years ago.\n \n Yesterday Jane got drunk and hit Mary with a baseball bat, breaking Mary's leg, when she learned that Mary was having an affair with Lisa. As a result, Mary decided to end her marriage with Jane in order to live in her house with Philip, Charles, and Lisa.\n \n What are the rights of Mary and Jane?\n http://www.mass.gov/bbe/essayquestionsfeb2007.pdf",

   "I hope this is a sincere apology and not just an attempt to deflect a negative image he may have created for himself.\n \n http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2008/01/10/man_who_sued_over_gay_marriage_question_on_bar_exam_apologizes/\n \n \nBy Mark Pratt \n Associated Press Writer / January 10, 2008 \n BOSTON-A man who filed a lawsuit claiming he failed the Massachusetts bar exam because he refused to answer a \"morally repugnant\" question about same-sex marriage says he has since changed his views on gay rights.\n \n more stories like this\"After speaking with numerous members of the gay community, including my own friends, I began to empathize with their denial of basic human rights and how they feel discriminated against,\" Stephen Dunne said Thursday in a telephone interview with The Associated Press.\n \n Dunne, an Irish immigrant who first came to the United States in 1998, said the change also was prompted in part by racism the Irish once faced in the U.S., his six-year stint in the Army and the war in Iraq.\n \n \"Members of the gay community are in combat and dying for their country and yet they're being denied the basic human rights they are fighting for,\" he said.\n \n Dunne first apologized for being an \"instrument of bigotry and prejudice\" in an e-mail published in the Jan. 3 edition of Bay Windows, a weekly Boston newspaper aimed at the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community.\n \n In the letter, he said his \"misguided\" lawsuit \"regrettably perpetuated intolerance and animosity towards my fellow Americans.\"\n \n Dunne, 31, was denied a license to practice law in May after scoring 268.866 on the exam, just short of the passing mark of 270. He sought $9.75 million in the federal lawsuit filed in June against the Massachusetts Board of Bar Examiners and the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.\n \n Dunne said his score was hurt because he refused to answer an exam question addressing the rights of two married lesbians, their children and their property during a divorce. He said the question legitimized same-sex marriage and same-sex parenting, contrary to his moral beliefs.\n \n He called the question a \"disguised mechanism to screen applicants according to their political ideology\" and said it \"has the discriminatory impact of persecuting and oppressing sincere religious practices and beliefs\" protected by the First Amendment.\n \n The suit also challenged the constitutionality of the Supreme Judicial Court's 2003 decision that made same-sex marriage legal in Massachusetts.\n \n But in October, Dunne, who represented himself in the case, asked that the lawsuit be dismissed, saying in a motion that \"defendants have removed the patently offensive and morally repugnant question\" from the exam.\n \n It was unclear whether the Massachusetts Board of Bar Examiners removed the question because of the lawsuit, and the board did not return messages left Thursday for comment.\n \n Dunne, who is Roman Catholic, said Thursday he no longer found the question objectionable, and still considers himself deeply religious.\n \n \"Christ said 'Love all, serve all,' \" he said. \"It was a message of inclusion rather than exclusion.\"\n \n Editors at Bay Windows at first were skeptical when they received the e-mail, said Susan Ryan-Vollmar, the paper's editor in chief.\n \n \"To be honest, we thought it might be a prank because it's very unusual for somebody who did something along these lines to apologize so publicly,\" she said.\n \n After verifying the e-mail's authenticity, a reporter conducted a lengthy interview with Dunne that the paper ran in conjunction with the letter.\n \n Ryan-Vollmar said Dunne's letter created a buzz in the gay community, with the letter and accompanying story among the most popular items on the paper's Web site all week.\n \n Lee Swislow, executive director of Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders, believed Dunne's apology was honest. \"I think it is genuine because I have seen so many other people make similar journeys,\" she said. \"He just made his publicly.\"\n \n Dunne dismissed cynics who think he's just changing his view to avoid appearing bigoted when applying for jobs. He said he plans to work for himself.\n \n Dunne, who has been studying 60 hours per week while working at a Boston law firm, said he expects to pass when he takes the bar exam again next month.\n \n \"I failed myself last time by not answering the question,\" he said.\n",
