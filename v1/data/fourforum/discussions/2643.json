   "A recent article in CNN http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/space/06/25/space.elevator.ap/index.html\n says that a scientist thinks we'll have space elevators in 15 years or so, using carbon nano-tubes for the cable. This seems far too optopistic to me. Even if the tubes are strong enough, it'll take alot more than 15 years till the tech is developed enough to manufacture them in the numbers needed.\n \n What do you all think?",

   "well, there's one small problem\n \n we haven't yet developed these \"cables\" out of carbon nanotubes that are stronger than steel\n \n this guy says he needs 2 more years to work on the cables\n this guy is the consummate optimist!\n \n There are hoards of research groups around the world working on these very problems. I doubt we'll see these cables (100+ miles of them) in 2 years. \n How will the elevator stand? What material can be used to build a 100+ mile tower? \n \n I think we'd see 500 story buildings before we see a space elevator.",

   "It's not 100+ miles of cable, it's 26,000 miles.\n \n For those not familiar with space elevators, they work (in theory) like this. Get a space platform in geosynchronous orbit. That means it stays over the same spot on the equator, about 26,000 miles up. From the platform you lower a cable all the way to the earth. Hook some elevator cars to the cable, run them with solar power collected from the sattelite, an voila, you can get into orbit for almost free.\n \n The reason the cable doesn't pull the platfrom down out of orbit is that while you're lowering the cable, you extend a massive weight out away from earth. Things in geosynchromous orbit have the neat property that if you give them a small push towards earth they'll spiral in, but if you give them a small push away from earth they'll escape earth's orbit. Thus, the cable will pull down, and the mass will pull out (up?) and by adjusting how far out you extend the mass you can get the two forces to balance.\n \n The main problem here, aside from cost, is finding a material strong enough to make a 26,000 mile cable from. Nano-tubes look promising, but many people, like me, think we have a ways to go before they're viable.",

   "Oh, now I understand! I was thinking Arthur C. Clarke's 3001 (read it?)\n In the book, he's got a ring around the earth, attached at various points by humongous towers made of solid diamond, I guess I let that influence me.\n \n WOW, so not 100 miles but 26,000 to GSO (I thought it was 23,000, but what do know?)\n \n Now, I get it. And now that I get it, it sounds even more far-fetched. \n One slip and........ emoticon_frazzled \n \n I can't think of any material that wouldn't totally buckle under it's own weight like that (even carbon nanotubes). Would there be something to keep all the cable from pulling the platform into the earth? If there were some sort of centrifugal mechanism then the cable would not only need to support its own weight, but the tension required to keep the platform in orbit. Thousands of miles of cable are not in GSO and would be \"falling\" the entire time. The platform would have to be in exactly the right place (probably to the inch) for these IMMENSE forces to balance. Could the cable withstand these forces? I doubt any forseeable cable could.
