   "It's also interesting to note that China has cruise missiles. They received the technology from Israel. Saddam's Anti-Aircraft weapons where Israeli (yes really).\n \n Iran showed off some of its defense strategy in the Hezbollah: Israeli battles we just witnessed. Their tactics mirror the Russian tactics used in WWII. Russia held back a highly advanced army by using effective tactics requiring very little resources.\n \n The battle strategy for defense is relatively simple. One knows the enemy must approach and that gives massive advantage to the defender. Hezbollah used very small detachments that where given very simple targets in a small area of opportunity. Two men would have anti-tank weapons and would allow a division to pass by with out engagement. Their job was to stop tanks and it's all they would address. Once a tank enters their field of opportunity they would attack and go to a predetermined fall back position and await the same conditions (not to many made a fall back position). No small detachments knew of other positions. The Israelis could only address very small detachments when detected and they where losing the game of ratios in both the cost of engagement and the man for man ratio. Bombing gave the appearance of an Israeli advantage in losses though it's unclear how much effect the bombing really had. If the missile batteries followed the same operational strategy (which would be easy to conclude) then the advantage was against Israel.",

The use of Nuclear weapons in Iran would place the world on alert for the same tactics against them. Any country feeling they where under aggression would know their options are limited and a first strike would be their only line of defense. We have a signed a No first use treaty with Russia regarding nuclear weapons but we have backed out of every treaty we had with them. \n \n Our current Generals demanded Bush remove the nuclear option from Iranian military planning (reported in the times) and Mr. Bush refused.

There are many reports suggesting this. However, like in most cases, attacks from outside cause those inside to band together in unity. (Us vs Them mentality).
