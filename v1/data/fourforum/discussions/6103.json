American workers have priced themselves out of the world market. When trying to figure in the higher cost of American wages and benefits, our products will never be competitive with the cheaper imports flooding in from newly emerging industrialized nations. Jobs in the service industry are safe for now only because we haven't found a way to import foreign accountants lawyers and plumbers. The long term implications will be realized when there aren't enough wage earners at the working level to sustain these services. I don't want to trivialize your point on legacy costs, but the high cost of even entry level labor in many industries is still not competitive with our foreign trading partners.",
