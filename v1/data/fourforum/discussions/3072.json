   "For issues, I attempt to look at the party, rather than the individual, in terms of position on particular issues. I don't think it's in a candidates best interest to ever tell the truth for thruth's sake, so I can't really rely on what they say. Nor can we rely on the political hype, it's just a song and dance...getting elected is their only goal.\n \n However, I DO look at the individual candidate for leadership, generally supported by charisma, and intelligence. I think leadership combines both charisma and intelligence, wielded together in a way that motivates and inspires.\n \n Independant, rational thinker. No, not making decisions in a vaccum, just capable of making a decision based on other's inputs, not just \"What the party wants them to do\".\n \n In these ways I think Reagan, and Clinton, where both good leaders, Reagan maybe highest on charisma, Clinton higher on intelligence, but both effective leaders. Clinton ruined much of is charisma with his infidelity during office, that was just sad...it also puts in question his willpower/intelligence to some degree.\n \n Dukakis didn't inspire me, and neither did Dole. Gore could have, had he been more personable, but he never broke the ice. Kerry sort of inspires me, just because he's a political fanatic, he's been debating serious issues...intelligently, since his teens. But place him next to Bush, and he's magnificent :/\n \n Bush, I just cannot stand listenting to him or seeing him. He seems tragically ignorant and incapable of communicating in anything less than a robotic, oddly punctuated manner. And I think he's neither an independant thinker, nor very intelligent. He doesn't read much, and he works 9-5 and hangs out on the ranch all the time. As a business owner, I have worked 12+ hours a day, and weekends, since I started, and that's LIGHT for a business owner..my mentors all worked more than me...for 5+ years in some cases. \n Yet someone who gets the chance to steer the helm of the greatest nation on earth can't put in some GD overtime or read to expand his knowledge? He has some physical charisma, but that's about it, the rest does nothing to inspire me.\n \n I am very moderate, and don't think either party is ever all encompasing right or the best just because they are party X. I realize to get what I want out of this country it's likely that I'll need a cyclic presidency of democrat, followed by republican, democrat, republican, etc...maybe mix in senate seats etc. to even it out however it falls during the election year. However, I DO think I can benefit, and the country as a whole, when either party is in office, when the person in charge is a great leader.\n \n So what do you look for in a leader/president? How do recent candidates stack up?\n \n Does it matter less about who is president and more about which party is in power? Are some people voting for Bush because he's from their party, but they too are not inspired by him? \n \n -Mach",

   "Do you think the average person (population as a whole) is incentivized to do the research to find out what they really need? \n\n probably not. but that doesnt mean they should be ignored. some of them do. and with avenues made available, the public will wise up and really think about what they need. the political ear IS the \"incentive\" for the public \n \n \nDo you think business serves an important role, in that they were successful enough to build the business through hard work/risk, and they directly serve the public interest through their goods/services? If they aren't able to efficiently provide goods/services, they are eliminated, wheras a person can be ultra-lazy and still cast a vote. Do business know to some degree, what people want, and are effecient at providing it?\n\n of course i do. i never said ignore the business sector either. you dont have to shut down everything just because you start listening to the public. domestic businesses do know to a certain extent what the public wants, but businesses dont provide everything, and the government should fill the gap that the private sector leaves out. my problem is governments listening ONLY to a handful of big business (most of whom are into foreign investments and little domestic interest)\n \n \nDo you think politicians know how to make the deals necessary to make progress in a people-driven system, and have the power to back it, and do you think congress/lawmakers, whitehouse administration, etc. have far more training and insight into what laws are needed for the American interest, more so than the people?\n\n so if politicians dont know how, nor have the power to, change the laws to suit the needs of the population they are governing, then what is their purpose?\n \n \nI think all three are utilized, and all three are important, I don't know how WELL they are utilized...but I do think the interplay between them is better than the public opinion alone. we check and balance the politics and the corporate workings, but only if we work hard at it.

   "\n So what do you look for in a leader/president?\n\n \n I think some presidents have a very striking quality about them (what quality depends on the president obviously) that draws people in and they get very attached, in a way, to that president. I think that this happens in part because people have somewhat of an ideal in their heads of a president and this president has a particular quality that is a part of that ideal and they get attached to it because they (we) are desperately seeking that ideal. So to present to you, here is my ideal. Now, you may not like one or more of these presidents on the whole, or some of the things they did (me included) but whatever your political view, these are important qualities that stand out to people from all over the political spectrum.\n The Ideal President\n A president with:\n \n *The straight-forwardness and \"the buck stops here\" attitude of Truman.\n *The charisma of Reagan.\n *The intelligence of Clinton and Woodrow Wilson.\n *The vision of Kennedy.\n \n Thoughts anyone?",
