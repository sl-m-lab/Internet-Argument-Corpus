   "A dwarf\n Each door has no exits for our mortal portals. Life at the end is disgusts of nothings. I denounce the fouls of the flautists and expose the specks on all scepter s evil spirits. Truths are veiled by swaddling clothes. Heavy hands are on packages of every poor but we are tramps with not free trips. Holly heaven give rise to succeeding ignoramus then goblins kiss their fore heads openly.\n Sorrows are bugs that swim in poor s ileums. Your kisses are some things track us in your frames and your powers are some things that we feel very uneasy. Go damn Gods. Are you ready to conciliate all evil snakes? You mean to seal all beautiful minds in your golden cabinets and you treat yourself as the Gods.\n Beside all shiny utensils in your kitchens for you to eat for the way s that you are. All dances on the stages are now covered with pubescences. If you still wish to disguise to be some ascetics for all your evil powers. Peoples would like to shave off all the pubic hairs of revisionists. Stitches to our sleazy clothes need no gold threads. Cheap hearts of dwarfs pelt with short legs but there also some ambush of snakes. \n But wise men pelt with rotten tomatoes. Grey is modest white but not bright. However swords are red and bloody while the sheaths are grey with irons. Tyrants have no self-worth when their scepters are drop off. Tropical plants have jointed steams that reveal the truths of irons. \n Treasures are heavy in silver clouds and wish the nods of the thunders bolts then rains are exchange with powers. I wish to taste the sweet of the rains and ask for the comforts of very light rain and winds. This evil creature has two wings and three heads. One resembles the symbols of a savant. His passwords and saliva are rains to overflow to four seas\n Moneys and official powers are two other derivative heads.\n This two heads are inherited with two wings. Two wings can deploy troops when they spread out in their positions. It would look like the birthday s party of weasel to hens. When the great poets and veeps change the courses to benefit the poor\n The three scared heads of ignominies or giants are night mares for little dwarfs. Their scurfs are foods or poisons will depend on some hearts. They poke to their targets with their hairs and then fingers. If you take their scurfs for foods then you are respond to agree to their venomous schemes.\n When we stroll along the green hills of the insulars mosses are on your hips and lavers are some of your snacks. Let we have some picnics without fear of the snakes. For certainties we put down our small pieces of sulphur-stones and take a bath in some thermal springs. Clean and white beautiful bodies of your girl friends associated with some purples. The yellows from sulphurs add with blue does not appear to green. It is the special worlds of some dwarfs.\n A dwarf is some one who belongs to the doors of some mortal portals unless scientists can change our hopes. A dwarf lives in the shelters of some crevices in rocks. Rocks are heavy minerals that can stand weaves. They are the flags to mole s protections and have wide extensive uses in our world. It is hard to move to build the king s pyramids. It is innocent even stain to red by some puppet governments \n By cheung shun sang=cauchy3=laplace181 :xbanghead :xbanghead",
