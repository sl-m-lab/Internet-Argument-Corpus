   "New York Gay Marriage Legalization Transformed National Debate: Legal Experts\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - When New York became the sixth and by far the largest state to legalize same-sex marriage, following a grueling overtime session in the state Legislature Friday, it immediately transformed the national debate over the issue, legal experts said.\n \n With a population over 19 million -- more than the combined population of the five states that currently allow gay marriage, plus the District of Columbia, where it is also legal -- New York is poised to provide the most complete picture yet of the legal, social and economic consequences of gay marriage.\n \n \"I think that having same-sex marriage in New York will have tremendous moral and political force for the rest of the country -- in\n part because New York is a large state, and in part because it hasn't come easily,'' said Suzanne Goldberg, a professor at Columbia Law School.\n \n The New York Assembly passed same-sex marriage legislation twice before, in 2007 and 2009, but in both cases it stalled in the state Senate, as it nearly did again this week. The bill passed late Friday after legislators agreed on language allowing religious organizations to refuse to perform services or lend space for same-sex weddings.\n \n The new law's impact can be measured in part by the numbers at play: New York is home to more than 42,000 same-sex couples, according to an analysis of U.S. census data conducted by the Williams Institute. This means, among other things, that the number of same-sex couples living in states allowing same-sex marriage has more than doubled overnight.\n \n REAL-WORLD DATA\n \n If a significant portion of those couples choose to marry, it could provide a wealth of new information about the practical economic effects of such legislation, from employment and retirement benefits to divorce rates and wedding and tourism industries, said New York University Law School professor Arthur Leonard.\n \n Parties on both sides of the issue frequently invoke the hypothetical economic impact of same-sex marriage, Leonard pointed out, so the influx of real-world data from New York could go a long way toward changing those hypotheticals into concrete facts.\n \n \"It becomes less of an experiment the more information we have,'' he added.\n \n The ripple effect of the new law is likely to provide more than just\n information, said Goldberg. New York's mobile population means that\n the effects of the law will reach literally into other states.\n \n \"New Yorkers tend to move about the country quite a lot,'' Goldberg\n said. \"High numbers of same-sex couples likely to marry here will increase pressure on other states to treat those couples fairly.''\n \n Currently, 39 states have laws defining marriage as between a man and a woman, according to statistics from the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n \n NEW YORK UNIQUE\n \n For states considering how to handle calls for same-sex marriage, Massachusetts -- the first state to legalize it, in 2004 -- has generally served as the reference point, Leonard said. But he noted that New York was different from Massachusetts for two primary\n reasons.\n \n First, it has more than three times as many people. Second, New York instituted same-sex marriage through legislation, complete with religious exemptions. Massachusetts, on the other hand, established the right to same-sex marriage in a court ruling.\n \n The significance of that difference cuts both ways, said Michael Dorf, a professor at Cornell Law School who studies the constitutional and social consequences of same-sex marriage in the United States.\n \n When legislation fails to pass, it can serve as evidence of a minority group's political weakness or of widespread prejudice against it, Dorf said. Both are factors courts use under an equal-protection analysis to determine whether to intervene and protect minority rights. The New York legislation's success, in contrast, could lead judges in other states to say, \"We don't need to intervene, let the political process work this through,''' Dorf said.\n \n But because courts are also wary to make rulings that are perceived to be too far outside the mainstream, the New York law may begin to tip that balance.\n \n \"To the extent that the anti-same-sex marriage argument has been that this is a radical change and incompatible with the country's social mores, the fact that the country's third most populous state has done so shows that it may not be,'' Dorf said.\n \n Regardless of the immediate impact of the law, Dorf said, politics and public opinion on the issue \"are in the course of rapid change.''\n \n \"It seems inevitable that we'll have same-sex marriage in most of the states within a decade,'' he said. \n",

I guess we'll see, It was signed into Law so there's no going back now....\n\n \n IMO a lot of this is a widespread paradigm shift in the broader American culture. The population at large, especially younger (post boomer) generations are a lot more accepting of the idea of gay marriage. Couple this with a MASSIVE increase in political participation of younger voters over the last decade, and I dont think it is at all surprising that we are seeing these changes. \n \n In my state they actually passed an anti gay marriage constitutional amendment. The religious folks are up in arms here lately because it has been suggested (and is probably true) that if they ran a new vote, they could get that amendment struck down. There has been a large change in voter demographics here. Huge numbers of younger people who in the past could not be counted on to show up to vote are suddenly looking around, realizing that the country is being run by outdated nitwits, and are showing up to vote. \n \n Personally I see this as another civil rights movement. It took a LONG time for the civil rights movement in this country to get rolling, but once it did, we saw a lot of progress relatively quickly. I would imaging that 10 years from now the idea that gays should not marry will be a foreign one to most Americans, and 20 years from now the mainstream will think it was embarrassingly idiotic that they were ever unable to. \n \n I know that is not a whole lot of consolation for people whose rights are being trampled on today, but sometimes justice takes time, and frankly a lot of times you just have to wait for the old folks to either die or become so senile that they cant find their way to the voting booth. \n \n The other option is violent revolution, which I am not entirely opposed to (and I think we could work into a nifty cap and trade program), but sadly americans are pretty much programmed from birth to work within the system...even while admitting the system sucks and does not work right....which makes getting a good revolution up and running very difficult.",
