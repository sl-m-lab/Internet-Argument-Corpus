   "My statement had nothing to do with making up definitions. You are fast proving yourself to be not worth the effort.\n\n \n Except that you defined Marxism as Capitalism. And if I'm not worth the effort why is it that you can't refute anything I say and are increasingly relying upon worthless statements?\n \n You're doing what Supersport is doing. Pretending people don't make arguments because you either can't admit you're wrong or your debate skills are fundamentally weak. \n \n \nAgain...a disconnect. My opinion of your definition of clear has nothing to do with liberalism.\n\n \n Come again? You use liberal like Marc uses atheist. \n \n And I see you can't define it, not surprising as you're not willing to admit you use it as everyone who disagrees with you.\n \n \nYou show a propensity to evade honest, fruitful discussion by digression.\n\n \n Come again?\n \n I asked you two hard questions. Neither of which you answered.\n \n I asked you to define two key terms. You couldn't define liberalism and now you're pretending like you didn't define Marxism. What is really amusing is that you defined Marxism as being anti-class. And now it is not surprising that you won't answer my questions that deal with a large amount of funding coming from groups that have huge amounts to lose from a classless society. That's pretty much admission you don't have a argument.\n \n Hillary is a Marxist, where Marxism is pro-destruction of the class society, but you won't answer why the upper classes who have the most to lose if Hillary actually is a Marxist are the primary drivers of her fundraising. Furthermore you won't address how her Tyson connections have nothing to do with her vote getting. You falsely, without effort or research bothered to look up the date of the Tyson food recalls and just assumed she did it to get votes. That is essentially unthinking which proves Kronus's point.\n \n You have effectively lost the argument right there. You put your argument into a corner which there is no escape and now you're trying to pretend as if you didn't do that. \n \n \nOne only has to have listened to several news sources (not just one...not just the liberal ones...not just the conservative ones...SEVERAL SOURCES) for the past few years to realize that Hillary's advisors gave her a makeover after Slick Willy' impeachment.\n\n \n Not really. Most of your sources were beyond biased without actual factual evidence and were all from Republican Blogs (none of which actually cite real sources) and the one credible source only talked about her thesis, which she's 59 right? So 59-21 = 38 years ago, a paper that may make her look like a Communist. You never dealt with my reference to Mr. Kristol. If previous beliefs are what people believe now, which is your argument, then the rabid republican that Mr. Kristol is, is indeed a lie and he's still a ardent socialist.\n You won't defend your logic because you're smart enough to realize that it's a lost cause. \n \n \nYou can come back and say that I didn't answer all your demands. You'd be right.\n\n \n You didn't answer a single one well. And the one you did actually refutes your arguments.\n \n By defining Marxism you invalidated everything you say about how Hillary is a Marxist. \n \n You have effectively failed to prove she is and provided numerous reasons why she isn't. \n \n \nBTW, there is no way I could possibly care any less whether Kronus is laughing at me or not.\n\n \n I doubt that. If that was true, you'd defend your indefensible arguments. Since you're not, you obviously care about not giving us more ammunition to use against you, thus you are lying. \n \n If Hillary is really a Marxists:\n \n Why are corporations and elite members of this class society donating huge sums to her campaign? If she was really a Marxist, she'd be for the elimination of both. Why would lawyers, doctors and Corporations all donate to her cause if she was trying and believed in/to terminate them?\n \n If she is a Marxist, why did she support Bill's lowering of health requirements and inspections on Tyson Bird products after the donated a huge sum to his campaign? Obviously lowering requirements on them allowed them to gain more market and profits as well as exploiting their workers without supervision. \n \n Remind me, Marxism is for capitalism and classes or against?\n \n You haven't done anything to prove that Hillary is a Marxist and now that you've defined Marxism, you act like you didn't because your own definition includes a war on the upper classes, which just happens to be where Hillary is getting her money from.",

If the proletariat during its contest with the bourgeoisie is compelled, by the force of circumstances, to organize itself as a class; if, by means of a revolution, it makes itself the ruling class, and, as such, sweeps away by force the old conditions of production, then it will, along with these conditions, have swept away the conditions for the existence of class antagonisms and of classes generally, and will thereby have abolished its own supremacy as a class. In place of the old bourgeois society, with its classes and class antagonisms, we shall have an association in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all.\n\n \n \n What he is calling for here is a violent revolution of the proletariat to once and for all seize power. He also saw this as an inevitable event, but not necessarily a planned one, because the bourgeoisie would never allow the proletariat to amass the power necessary to violently overthrow them if it was predicatable that they would do so. \n \n So, according to Marx, pretty much the inevitable trasnsition from socialism to communism involves a violent overthrow...the end of political power and the end of the bourgeoisie. At the same time, the transition from capitalism to socialism requires the assistance of the bourgeoisie and whatever political power that may be in order to succeed. \n \n What that tells me is that not only are there an awful lot of marxists out there who do not necessarily consider the destruction of classes and corporation to be a critical aspect of MArxism, but that Marx himself expected as much since nobody willingly works toward their own destruction.",

   "LOL. I was talking to a guy today about german engineered industrial equipment. He had a unit (new) that broke down and they could not figure out what was wrong with it, so the german manufacturer sent an entire egnineering team and and entire team of technicians over on a plane to troubleshoot the unit and repair it.

   "Yeah, I don't doubt those two options. The question is can you slowly get rid of the military thus spread out the loss over a few years. \n\n \n I think that whether we can spread it out over several years to lessen the blow depends on when we start. When it comes to economic planning, the US is not real big on forward planning. We could have started a couple decades ago and by now we would be at the point where we have a reasonably sized military, a sustainable fiscal outlook, and the pain would have been barely noticable.\n \n Today, we have our treasury secretary running to congress every year or 2 to explain to them that if they don't raise the debt ceiling the Government will become insolvent and be forced to cease operation. If you look at government spending as a percentage of just about any data set, you see that reductions in federal spending will result in recession. Steep enough reductions will result in depression. The Federal governments spending is BY FAR the dominate force in our economy, and having a nation whose primary occupation is the maintenance and funding of their government is simply not sustainable.\n \n Personally, I think the discussion of \"sweeping changes vs gradual changes\" is moot because it certainly appears that in the end the path we will choose is \"No changes\". We will just keep doing what we are doing until we reach a crisis point and by then it will be too late.\n \n \nIn reality you only need to clean up a few things to get out budget in line.

That's not Marxism. \n \n \n\"The State and Revolution\", Lennisn blueprint for the Soviet Union, was little more than a paraphrase of Marx's work.\n\n \n Aside from failure to actually go that way and having a class system...\n \n Marxist specifically wrote that Russia would be one of the LAST to go Socialist. How could Lenin have followed Marx when he complete bungled the order? He missed the democracy/capitalist step of Marx's plan. \n \n \nSince marx was essentially the inventor of Socialism, it is not at all unreasonable to say that socialist ideas are marxist.\n\n \n Socialism and actually true Communism has been practiced well before Marx or even the Europe states of the 1900s were born. Small groups in the African rainforests and South American Andes were practicing it well before he came along. So he's not a the inventor.

But Jim's argument is that Hillary is a Marxist, and as you said the bourgeoisie would not allow this if they know it was happening. Thus if Hillary is actually a Marxist, they'd be donating her opponent as they KNOW she is going to get rid of them and thus would work to prevent her from accumulating the necessary power.
