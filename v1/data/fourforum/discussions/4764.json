   "I'm new to this forum so please forgive me if this has been asked before.\n I have been brought up in a Christian household but stopped going to church over 5 years ago. I believed that we evolved, as that is what I had been tault at school.\n Within the last week I have had new evidence which casts doubt of a lot of what Evolution is based on (I was presented with a copy of Evolution: Fact or Fiction which was written by a Professor of Evolution who was appalled when he discovered that a lot of the diagrams used in text books, even at degree level were based on little or no evidence).\n I have been reading as much evidence on both sides as I have yet to be convinced either way. My main question is this:\n \n As far as I can see, Evolutionists agree that natural selection is how we have evolved for microscopic life forms. To me this means that a single organism in a species mutates, giving it and its offspring an advantage over the rest of the population. If this mutation is random doesn't that mean that the gene pool for every species would be very small as, in the long run, only the offspring of the mutated species would survive?\n I am not clued up on what the gene pools are like for each species today but as far as I am aware this hasn't been proven.\n \n I would be interested to hear opinions on both sides but please refrain from the pointless arguing I have seen on other posts.",

   "...I was presented with a copy of Evolution: Fact or Fiction which was written by a Professor of Evolution who was appalled when he discovered that a lot of the diagrams used in text books, even at degree level were based on little or no evidence...\nCan you tell us who this \"Professor of Evolution\" is? There are lots of booklets called entitled \"Evolution: Fact or Fiction\" and all (aFAIK) are written by evangelicals with next to no knowledge of evolution at all. Sadly such \"Christians\" are happy to lie about their qualifications if it helps them spread doubt about science. I suspect what you are referring to is one such booklet, but I need a name to know for sure.\n \n \nAs far as I can see, Evolutionists agree that natural selection is how we have evolved for microscopic life forms.

If this mutation is random doesn't that mean that the gene pool for every species would be very small as, in the long run, only the offspring of the mutated species would survive?\nIn some cases yes, in others no. If the mutation gives a huge advantage, then there will be a decline in the size of the gene pool for a while (eg when the Australian rabbit population was reduced form 500 million to 100 million by myxomatosis, the gene pool strunk as a result and the genetic \"mutation\" that gave increased resistance spread throughout the whole population as a result). Most of the time though single mutations do not have such a huge advantage and so genetic variation is maintained.",

The problem is, you are overestimating the amount of advantage a mutation is likely to provide. Simple Medel genetics also comes into play: some of the offpring of parents both of whom have the advantage will themselves lack that advantage. Finally such advantages might be transitory due to fluctuating environmental conditions.\n \n Mutations almost never come to dominate a population. It is possible to express why this is mathematically. I'll dig out the info for tomorrow if you are interested.\n \n \nIf a human catches the mumps, afterwards they then have a natural immunity to it, but this is not passed onto their children. Is this not the same thing with your rabbits?\nNo, your mumps example is a case of aquired immunity, not natural resistance. Better analogies are sickle cell anemia (the heterozygous carriers have an increased natural resistance to malaria) or rare individuals who are naturally immune to infection by the AIDS virus (http://www.niv.ac.za/virussa/aidsa/aid63.htm for example)",

Is this not the same thing with your rabbits?\n\n \n I know this has been explained a few times, but I would like to try to make the answer more clear. The example of a disease that wipes out large numbers of a population is a bad example of how mutations and natural selection occur. Since a species is living currently, it would be very unlikely that a mutation immediately occurs which is necessary for the survival of that species. When a deadly disease strikes a population, if only one or two members of the population have a mutation to prevent that disease, the population would die out. More than likely, the mutation occurred long ago and was unnoticed; it could certainly be as common as white rabbit hair vs brown rabbit hair. When the disease strikes, a significant portion of the population would need to have that mutation already in their genes in order for the species to survive, and because of this, the gene pool would still be large.\n \n More common is a mutation which offers a slight advantage, as explained by others here. In this case, the animal with the slightly beneficial mutation breeds with another animal without the mutation, then some children get the mutation and they breed with other animals. The animals with the fewest beneficial genetic mutations are killed off by predators, starve to death, etc. The animals with the most beneficial genetic mutations are most likely to survive and reproduce, and eventually the beneficial genetic mutations become very common across a species.\n \n It should also not be a good idea to assume that mutations were uncommon, for although most genetic mutations are uncommon in humans, there are a few that we see repeatedly. It would not be a far leap to assume that earlier species did not have the same protection from mutations that today's species have.",

   "think of the number line. do numbers begin at negative infinity and never get to 0? or do they start at 0 and never get to infinity? what if we start or number system at zero... then we have a list of numbers that never began and never ends, yet it exists... hmmm....\n \n \n ah, the age old argument of \"if God exists, how come bad things happen\". the existence of evil does not immediately nullify the existence of good. in fact, the existence of evil is necessary for there to be good. if evil didnt exist, how would good be recognized\n \n however, on that same note we find what may be seen as God's weakness: his desire to be recognized. you ask \"if God is so great and strong and wise, why does he desire praise so much?\" i guess thats his perogative, i mean, it may sound pretty trivial to us, but when you really look at it, throughout the bible, all God really desired of humans is gratitude, appreciation and acknowledgement. this was the primary way to please God or vex him. but hey, he's God, and he did all those great things, so perhaps its not too much to ask, is it?\n \n (bear in mind that all we know about God is what the bible tells us, and nothing more)\n\n \n Have you taken the time to read the first books of the Old Testament? Clearly it is a blueprint for genocide. But beyond that, an interesting thing happens from the first time that God makes himself known in the burning bush to Moses. At that time God was so overwhelming a presence that one couldn't even begin to see or relate to him. Then as time progresses, God becomes more and more accessible until he just sort of bee-bops in at any old time to commiserate with the leaders of Israel. \n \n The whole subject is clouded in unknowns and surmise. I found sometime ago that religion just left me cold. Every religion seems to believe it is the one true way to eternal life and everyone else is going to burn in hell for an eternity. It's craziness. But then if not God, what about the beginning of time and matter? I wish I knew the answer.",
