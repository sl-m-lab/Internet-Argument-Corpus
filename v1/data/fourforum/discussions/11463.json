Saakashvili by US support forgot about world's legal regulations and his troops are attacking ambulances even! How long will UN and its Security Council keep silent? Bustards, UN forgot about its mission. In fact they are encouraging that crazy freak Saakashvili and his Washington patrons to continue atrocities.

That's no good surely!\n Then economically the cost of this escapade is rather high I should say. Georgia's not doing well economically. War is costly as it is. And Georgian president has already promised to invest lots of money into the ruined South Ossetia when it's back into Georgia as loyal part of it (which I strongly doubt indeed). What would be the origin of that money, I wonder? Is it going to be American taxpayer's pocket or what? Amid the current economy slidedown in USA that's looking alarming indeed. \n I am absolutely sure that smart guys in D.C. have must miscalculated smth in case of Georgia. It comes too costly.

   "Hello! I think you all have heard much about Saakashvili in these later days. And you all most likely know that Saakashvili has slipped up greatly, which is why he is now practically standing on the verge of overthrow by political opposition of Georgia. Despite all that, Saakashvili's masters in Washington have suggested him a new plan that is meant to help Saakashvili win back one-time rule over minds and hearts of Georgian people. For this purpose, a convoy of cold storage trucks will head from Gori to Tbilisi being filled to the top with... disfeatured dead bodies dressed in military uniform of Georgian soldiers. Saakashvili's considerations are clear - he would show these corpses to foreign journalists (most of them are already on the way to Georgia, when the CNN journalists are in the first flight) and declare that that would be victims of savage offense by Russian soldiers who have 'encroached upon the Holy land of Georgia - the pillar of American-type democracy in the Caucasus', which would naturally set off a wave of anti-Russia hysteria within Georgian society. That's what Saakashvili really wants - the support of the nation and a continuing pointless war against a foreign enemy, which unites a nation around its leader. No matter that the foreign enemy was invented be Saakashvili himself - Russia was never waging a war against Georgia, only protecting its nationals in South Ossetia. As a matter of fact, it is not Saakashvili after all who wants that war, but the wire-pullers in Washington. But anyways, that's terrible not to let dead people be duly buried. That's blasphemy!",

Georgian families can't bury their killed sons, daughters and husbands 'cause their president is preparing sort of display of the bodies \"tortured by Russians and Ossetins\" in Tbilisi! That's what I heard from the French journalists working here in Georgia. I'd prefer this to be their sinister fantasy just a la Steven Spielberg. Alas some real facts I know add meat to it. \n The first is that Coca-Cola plant in Gori (a city in Georgia) has delivered lots of ice ... to preserve the corpses of the Georgian soldiers to be delivered to Tbilisi.\n The second is that large team of American journalists is to arrive into Georgia soon for \"information coverage of an important event\". Far as I know there's no such event pending... unless the one which may be prepared by Saakashvili. And that must be some provocation, which comes logically. Both Saakashvili and his American friends can't be happy with the present status. Their aims in subduing of South Ossetia and Abkhazia and in more general sense of the whole Caucasus region can be achieved only by force and they haven't been achieved so far! \n Russians are after peace in the region (and their supporters surely), while Georgia and USA are after war.

I've been living here for 10 years already but it never was so terrible like now. After Saakashvili became president, the attitude to non-Georgians (not only Russians like me but also Armenians, Greeks, Ajarians, Azerbaijanis, etc) was turning worse and worse! After the recent happenings in South Ossetia our life is a nightmare! I fear to go out of house and prefer not to do without acute need. I would gladly leave Georgia till it calms down if only I could to - Georgian authorities merely won't allow us go away! Once I was close to be bereft of my ID. I was walking along a street when some policeman stopped me and said to show him my ID. When I gave it to him, he nearly tore it into two halves! I was lucky to wrest it from his grasp and the policeman was about to beat me up for that. Thank God I was quick enough to run away from the place! It is also impossible to go to Russian embassy. Some thugs are loafing thereabouts the embassy and I fear even to approach them! In such a manner we became outright hostages of Saakashvili's regime. Our life became terrible and we cannot leave the country. I don't know how long we can keep living like that.

In this topic I want to share some of my most remarkable observations that I was able to make during the recent few years on the information taken from the Internet. \n \n First of all, that's the information about groups of specially trained young people in Ukraine and the Baltic states. According to the information I used to come across on various forums, these groups were secretly trained by US army specialists at the witting of authorities of Ukraine and Baltica region countries and with the task to commit various acts of sabotage along with acts of provocation both on the territory of Ukraine and Baltic region, but not there only. During the recent armed conflict between Georgia and South Ossetia, these guys were also said to appear in Georgia where they had a task of discrediting Russian peace keepers under request of Saakashvili by mere disguising into Russian military uniform and slaughtering the population of a small village near Kutaisi, Georgia. \n \n It looks like that Saakashvili got fond of that method. I came across information saying that Georgian president Saakashvili has encharged groups of Georgian military men with a certain task - instigate anti-Abkhazian and anti-Ossetian moods amongst Georgian ethnic minorities using just the same means - disguising into Abkhazians or Ossetians and armed plundering of settlements of Svans, Azerbaijanians and Armenians. \n \n I wonder what other dirty tricks Mr Saakashvili is going to use.",

Though it seems to me that you-know-who in Washington did not really understood what Saakashvili's aggression might result in. Just for your information, Georgia is a very important element of energy security of quite many states - the whole Southern Europe, Mediterranean states, India, China, Israel, and... that may sound paradoxical - the US itself! Nowadays Georgia transits Azerbaijani crude oil (via the BTC and Baku-Supsa oil pipelines, and railroad to the port of Poti, Batumi and Kulevi) and gas (via the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum gas pipeline). There is also plan for the Nabucco pipeline project. So it turns out that launching war against South Ossetia imperiled all these oil&gas projects, which was first and foremost a miscalculation of Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.",
