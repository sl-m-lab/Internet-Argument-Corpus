   "currently women are held to a lesser standard than men when they join the military. having been in the military i know the differences. where men are required to complete roughly 65 pushups in 2 minutes minimum, women are only required to complete 32 in 2 minutes minimum; men must complete 75 situps in 2 minutes time where women are only required to complete 37 in 2 minutes time; on the run section of the physical test men are required to run 2 miles in 15 minutes max, and women are required to run 2 miles in just under 30 minutes max.\n \n having seen the vast differences in physical requirement standards i am fully in favor of keeping women out of physically intensive combat roles. this essentially includes any sort of frontline duty. ie: footsoldier, apc operator, tank operator, combat engineering, medic, etc. these sort of frontline tasks require vigorous physical stamina, and seeing that women are currently not being held to the standards that men are i do not favor sending them to the frontline where they would be required to handle hand to hand combat, sustained firefights, long runs/marches to reach battlelines, fixing HEAVY vehicle track that has broken, loading 50 lb cannon rounds in 2 seconds one right after the other (for as long as 45 minutes sometimes), etc. i would not favor a man held to less standards than me being right next to me either however.\n \n now, thats said, my argument is not about keeping women out of the military, but it is about holding them to the SAME rigorous physical standards as men. seeing that they currently are not, i do not favor the idea of sending undertrained human beings into combat where they need to be relied upon when they have proven they cannot be, due to lower requirements. i do not doubt that there are some women out there that can handle the same standards men are required to meet, and thus i would be in favor of allowing those women to join the combat ranks of men, the problem is simply that they are not trained like men and should not be on the frontlines. \n \n my idea is simply this: \n create a sexless physical requirement standard.\n remove the ban on women in combat roles.\n do not class soldiers as men or women, only class as soldiers.\n abolish sex specific restrooms, barracks, etc.\n if a women becomes pregnant she MUST have an abortion immediately.\n remove the draft. \n \n in my opinion doing the above would create an environment where the best would succeed and be trained to be the best, while anything less than the best would simply be tossed to the curb (like they should be). the military needs to create the best trained army possible, not drafting high numbers of bodies that dont even care to be there, not catering to weak women and weak men, not catering to people's worries about seeing the opposite sex naked, not worrying about whether a soldier is a man or a woman, etc. if you do all of the above, and i mean all, i would be highly in favor of allowing women to do every job a man can do in the military.\n \n one note, those feminists that worked so hard to make women equal to men are also th ones that fought so hard AGAINST drafting women and holding women to the same standards as men in the military. hmm, i wonder why they did that? (sic)\n\n \n \n The all important upper body strength. I once had the privlage of pulling a firefigters corpse out of the basement of a house that has burned because his \"buddy\" (firefighters use the buddy system when fighting interior attacks) was a woman who flunked the physical agility test 3 times, then sued to get a job on the fire department. The guy fell through the floor and she couldn't pull him back up. In firefighting, as in combat, if things go wrong, your life often ends up in the hands of the guy next to you. I personally prefer that it be somebody who passed the physical parts of the test.",

   "I have to take the opinion of Rush Limbaugh on this one. We should not put women near the front lines just because of safety issues.

Nothing wrong with that, it's just we might face more of those Lynch fiascos, only they won't go so well.\n \n Anyway, Rush came up with a great idea: if women want to be in combat, we should have rotations of duty. Whenever one group of women is going through extremely nasty PMS, we send them at the enemy. Ah, yes, it was Rush in The Way Things Ought To Be, the women in combat section\n \n \n \" . . . Women have been acquitted of murder by explaining that they had PMS and didn't know what they were doing or couldn't control their behavior at the time of the crime.\n Now, folks, I have a compromise proposal to allow certain women into combat. I propose the formation of the All American First Cavalry Amazon Battalions. We will have fifty-two battalions, one for every week of the year. That way we can guarantee we will always have a combat-ready battalion of Amazons with PMS who will always be available to do battle with the enemy.\n Imagine you are Manuel Noriega, or Saddam Hussein. Take your pick. You're in your presidential bunker, under attack by the Americans. But you're holding out okay--somehow you have even managed to elude the new highly touted American \"smart weapons.\" The only hassle you've got is that some American GIs are playing rock-and-roll music at about 800 decibels outside your bunker. Sometimes you want to commit suicide, because you're convinced they are sending subliminal messages as part of the music. But you're coping with it and you certainly aren't threatened with any physical harm.\n Then, suddenly, outside your window you hear a bloodcurdling cry: \"I AM OUTRAGED BY IT! OUTRAGED, I TELL YOU!\" Sure enough, you look outside and it's Sergeant Major Molly leading the first battalion of Amazons with PMS over the hill, coming right at your bunker. The sight would be enough to scare the pants off of anybody, and there's only one thing you could do: surrender. Voila! The good guys win again!\"\n \n If that offended anyone, I'm sorry.

Which country are you in again? I'm in the throws of joining the Aussie army (4RAR-Cdo) and we have to do 60 push ups, 100 sit ups, 10 chin ups, swim 400 metres (in full uniform) in 18 minutes and tread water for another two, run 2.4 Kilometres (1.5 Miles) in 11 minutes in patrol order (webbing, uniform, rifle) march 15 Kilomteres in 4 hours in marching order (28 kilo pack + rifle) not to mention the operational ability tests. This is of course, only the requirements for the Cdo regiment, but all army applicants are expected to run three miles in less than 20 minutes, whether they be male or female. \n \n I am very much against having women in front lone combat roles, for a few reasons.\n \n 1 - It creates dissent. Men will resent women who become NCOs, and are more likely to disobey or ignore their orders, which can mean death on the battlefield.\n \n 2 - It creates 'extra' relationships. Most men in the army (at a guess) are heterosexual. It is not only possible, but likely that relationships will form that can jeopardise the safety of the entire squad.\n \n 3 - Women coming home in body bags will sway public opinion faster than men. The best way to lose a war is to have public support at home drop off. This in turn ensures that politicians distance themselves from the war, and cut off support. Remember the furor about the Jessica Lynch debacle? imagine if she had died. Imagine of many women had died fighting the Iraqis. Right now there would be zero support for american presence in Iraq, and the US would have pulled her troops out. Not a good situation.\n \n 4 - (A minor one) women are subject to extra 'health' issues. For at least one week a month (Or thereabouts) women will be less combat capable than men. It is a minor one, but every little bit counts.\n \n So in summary, I do not think women should be excluded from fornt-line combat roles because they are incapable, but because the military dynamic and social-political arenas are not yet ready for it. Perhaps in the future where men and women cease to be viewed as different types of people (If this ever happens) then they can be used to boost the numbers of troops in the military, but as it stands there is nothing to gain. No western army is so tiny and under-staffed that it needs to resort to enlisting women as front-line combat troops to boost its numbers (no upside) and any army that did would suffer muchly as a consequence. (definate downside). Since there is no positive and many negative reasons for doing it, I would consider it a bad move.",

   "they shouldnt, because while a pilot might never see the need to pull someone out of a foxhole, if their plane crashes they will become nothing more than a lowly infantryman. \n \n it is my belief that the military should train every soldier, regardless of branch, as an infantryman first and everything else second. you never know when the need will arise to pull a cook for infantry duty, or a ship will sink and crewmen come ashore in enemy grounds. thus i am strongly in favor of a single, standard requirement system, and a rigorous basic training, both of which are not present in the current usa military.\n\n \n True, but not entirely practical. In peacetime, or with a very large military (Such as the US currently has) you would want everyone to be as highly trained as possible. Ideally, every member of the military would be trained to the level of the SAS. Unfortunately, a large part of having said numbers, and having the ability to raise new troops more quickly means that you need to cut the volume and length of the training down. If you trained everyone for 18 weeks (Standard Aussie Rifleman training) in addition to their chosen specialisation, not only would it put a lot of people off joining, but make it much harder to raise re-enforcements quickly. Like I said, not a problem during peace-time or with a very large military...\n \n I am in favour of a standardised requirement for the pre-enlistment fitness assessments though, and ideally I would like to see all members of the military trained to higher level than they are, but realistically it just isnt going to happen.",

   "There are a few things I'd like to add - in general I DO support women in the military, but there are a few things I'd worry about<b></b>:\n \n 1. Physical differences. I know this is a cliche, but men ARE stronger and in general tend to have a better constitution. I'll be able to carry a wounded female comrade about my own weight and size to safety- I doubt a same size and weight female comrade could carry me to safety.\n \n 2. Women are exposed to greater dangers once they get captured. Physical force or mental pressure are common methods to treat and intimidate POWs - lets face it, beating and torture are common to extort information. While a women can withstand greater mental pressure than men can, they are exposed to a greater threat of rape or sexual abuse. This is not necessarily a reason to keep women out of the armed forces, but that's a risk they'll need to take once they join.\n \n Everything else can be dealt with and is secondary. The Israelis have proven women in the military are no big issue.\n \n There are women in most nations para-military police units as well. The German Bundesgrenzschutz (=Border Guards) made good experience with women in riot control or para-military police situations like protection of VIPs, area and object protection and several of the BGS and SEKs top-notch snipers are women.\n \n Women fought in the Yugoslav civil wars, in WW II and large factions of the FARCs or other similar south-American guerillas have women fighting as well. Experience has shown they can fight and are good soliders.\n \n I wouldn't have a problem with women in all aspects of the military.\n \n A few posters have mentioned women related medical issues - those can be easily solved: They'll have to take birth-control pills (assuming they don't do so anyway).",

   "I agree, women should not be allowed to serve in the front lines. I am also not sure about the \"rear echelon\" areas either, after all, Lynch was part of a supply convoy. I realize that there might come a time to put women in combat, but I think that it should be restricted to women with important skills in demand, such as nurses/doctors/mechanics (what is the world coming to?). Even that should be considered a last resort for the exact reasons that adept and others have listed.",

   "ok, have had this idea for some time but due to technical problems havent been able to post\n \n here is the thing, would you walk into a catholic church and say\n \"i love jesus christ and i want to join the church and dedicate my life to spreading his word, but i refuse to be a nun, make me a cardinal or ill cry\"\n \n ok, over the top, but similarly you dont walk up to the army guy and say i want to help defend my country if.....\n they do offer career paths now, but that is their option, the army has one main responsibility, to maintain the best fighting force it can. \n if they think that adding women to the infantry will weaken it as a whole, in any possible way, then they have the responsibility to say no, same way with gay men, they decided that an openly gay man would jeapordize moral, so they made a rule. just because they are run by the government does not mean they have to be PC\n \n now, for possible rebuttals\n \"so with that you remove the civil rights of half of the coutry?\"\n no, joining the army is not a civil right, it is a priveledge, if you are not able to take their training then they will not let you in no matter what your gender/age/race/species/preference of coffee/size of ears/length of nose",

   "Personally, I see nothing wrong with women in combat. I don't believe they'll hinder the accomplishments, though I do think that an all-male army would be more profitable, simply because men and women have trouble coexisting in a sex-starved world, so you're more liable to experience sexual deviance for those men who can't suppress their feelings. \n \n I think they should be permitted to join the military - it is a simple right they should be endowed with, but I'm not sure if both sexes work very well harmoniously.",
