   "I was projecting our household operating requirements for the next six-months and, as usual, fuel prices have increased 20% over the last year, same as the prior year. Food/household expense was up 13% over the last year, utilities 8%. Normal entertainment costs, we usually take four meals out weekly, not fast food, stayed about the same for the past year but two good restaurant owners I know are preparing to raise menu prices 10-15% to offset supplier increases they've absorbed. This is about what I've experienced for the past year in this locale. \n \n I'm wondering how general society is faring with these cost of living increases. While government inflation numbers exclude energy and food, the majority of wage earners aren't experiencing income growth anywhere close to actual cost increases. Any comments? European or other comparisons?",

   "What I don't get is that we basically pay farmers to produce less or to not produce. So, why can't they just save a few dollars there, let some farmers produce and increase supply. This would hopefully drive food prices down.\n \n As for me, living in Tennessee, I haven't seen an increase in electricity at all since I believe most of our electricity comes from hydroelectric. Some of it comes from coal, I think, but I don't think that coal prices have been going up. Natural Gas through last winter, though, was higher than it usually is, but IIRC, it was actually lower than last year.\n \n But for retail goods and food, which are for some reason a little higher here than surrounding states, have been creeping up slowly but surely. Restaurants are raising prices, but that may have more to do with a huge hike in property taxes that recently passed. It was like a 67% increase a few years after a 40% increase. Everyone here is super-miffed about that.\n \n Anyway, I think there's more to it than just oil prices, but the price of gasoline has been keeping some basic goods high in price. The funny thing is that gas prices go up 24 hours (or sooner) after a hike in oil prices, but when the oil prices go down it takes a few days before you see a decrease in the price of gas, or you don't see it at all if the dip didn't last more than a few days.",

Instead of easing into a reduced standard of living for the general population by biting the bullet and responsibly tightening purse strings, government policy has been subsidization of a false economy using debt to retain voter popularity. That's not sustainable as public debt will force interest rates up, as is now going on, not to curb domestic inflation but to sell treasury securities to foreign nations with valuable US markets to keep all the balls in the air.

This could be the equivalent of the fall of American Civilization. I hate being pessimistic but it seems foolish to not think about it. And it isn&#8217;t just the American economy, but Europe&#8217;s and Asia&#8217;s economies as well. For example, when Greece&#8217;s economy collapsed in May 2010 it brought down the value of the Euro throughout Europe. It was only because of England buying 1 billion dollars worth of Euro bonds that the damage done to the European economy was reduced.
