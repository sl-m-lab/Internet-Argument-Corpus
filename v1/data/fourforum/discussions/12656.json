   "Milton man guilty on poison charge in AlaskaBy GAZETTE STAFF AND ASSOCIATED PRESS Sunday, May 3, 2009 EMAIL SHARE PRINT ADVERTISEMENT \n \n ELMENDORF AIR FORCE BASE, ALASKA - A Milton man has been sentenced to nine years and six months in federal prison after being found guilty on charges he laced his wife's food with ulcer medication to force her to miscarry.\n \n A military panel Saturday sentenced Airman 1st Class Scott Boie, 23. In addition to the prison time, Boie's sentence included a dishonorable discharge, a forfeiture of pay and a reduction in rank to the lowest possible, Master Sgt. Demetrius Lester said.\n \n Boie was found guilty Friday of attempting to kill an unborn child, Lester said.\n \n He was, however, found not guilty of intentionally killing an unborn child, Lester said.\n \n Boie previously had pleaded guilty to assault and theft charges, Lester said.\n \n He is accused of poisoning his wife, Caylinn Boie, 21, sometime between April and June 2008 by lacing her food with Misoprostol, a drug used to treat stomach ulcers and also is known to cause miscarriages and induced abortions.\n \n The court martial-similar to a civilian trial, but judged by members of the military-started Thursday at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Anchorage, Ala., according to KTTU Channel 2 of Anchorage.\n \n According to KTTU:\n \n Caylinn testified that when her husband found out she was pregnant, he asked her to get an abortion, and she said \"No.\" They fought, but Caylinn decided to keep the baby, she said.\n \n Evidence showed Boie's computer had a Google search for \"at-home abortion methods.\"\n \n Boie's best friend, Senior Airman Ryan Bollinger, testified Thursday that he covered up the poisoning and helped lace food with medication.\n \n He received immunity for his testimony.\n \n A week later, Caylinn miscarried. She thought it was from medical causes until a friend told her it wasn't an accident.\n \n Caylinn apparently taped a partial confession by her husband and reported him to military investigators.\n \n She also taped him trying to convince her to say she wanted to induce the abortion, according to a tape played in court.\n \n The defense tried to establish that Caylinn Boie had a history of troubled pregnancies, and that her smoking might have induced the miscarriage.\n \n Boie also is accused of stealing and burning a 1990 Nissan truck in April 2008, according to the Air Force statement.\n \n Boie graduated from Milton High School in 2004 and completed basic training in 2005, according to Janesville Gazette archives.",
