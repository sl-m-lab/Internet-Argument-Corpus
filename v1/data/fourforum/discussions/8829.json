An average of 1.5 pregnancies per year would be pretty remarkable with a 9-month gestation period... (1.5 pregnancies per year would require an 8-month gestation period and no passing of unfertilized ova (not to mention instant reimpregnation) even if there are no miscarriages or abortions; uninterrupted menstrual cycles and miscarriages/abortions would require an even shorter gestation period.)\n \n Oh, right, miracle...
