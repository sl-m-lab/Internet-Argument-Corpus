You find it completely acceptable for Cindy to be at the SOTU making a political statement, when obviously she does not support the ideals and values of the President. But when the President goes to a funeral to pay respects to a great american, you find it distasteful. All the while, you don't seem to have a problem with democrats standing up and turning the funeral of this beautiful american into a Bush Bash. Now I ask you, which is more disrespectful to the memory of King? emoticon_wow \n \n It's sad that the funeral of a renowned civil rights advocate is turned into a forum for political wrangling. \n \n \nIt is not a crime to be a liberal.\n\n It's not a crime in and of itself to be a racist either, but that does not make it a good thing. Don't get me wrong, I am not trying to compare democrats to racists, but it makes a point. A title is just that, a title. It is how you conduct yourself as a member of a group that gives you either a positive or negative public perception. There are many great and respectable democrats whom I respect deeply, then there are some that I hold with no higher regard than racists or bigots. Same with republicans.",
