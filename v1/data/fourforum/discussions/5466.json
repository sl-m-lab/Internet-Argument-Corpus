   "Possible future president -- John McCain. Watch it if you are interested. Channel 118 on Dish Network.\n =========================\n Courage. Integrity. Valor.\n \n \"Faith of My Fathers\" is the true story of one man's honor in the face of adversity. From his rookie years at the Naval Academy in Annapolis, we watch John McCain's journey from brash Pensacola pilot to courageous Vietnam POW. There, caught in a political power play, the young McCain is forced to choose between the country he loves and his own survival. Through gripping flashbacks, we see how each experience and the enduring strength of his family legacy shapes the man--and the public servant--he would become.\n \n http://www.aetv.com/faithofmyfathers/",
