   "Just a little statistical observation on parking violations from the Wall Street Journal:\n \n \nBorn Bad\n August 18, 2006\n Corruption, it is widely agreed, is a global disease. But what causes it: The absence of rule of law, or cultural predisposition? A pair of social scientists found a Petri dish in which to find out, a place that throws together people from the world over and tempts them to break laws -- with zero legal enforcement. That's right, we're talking about the United Nations.\n \n Ray Fishman and Edward Miguel studied U.N. diplomats' parking habits from 1997 until 2002, a period when rule-breakers still enjoyed diplomatic immunity. (Countries now get dinged foreign-aid money for each unpaid fine.) Foreign dignitaries racked up more than 150,000 unpaid parking tickets, amounting to an outstanding bill of more than $18 million.\n \n The study posited that a cavalier approach to parking rules reflected respect for the law in general, and national attitudes about official corruption -- since we are talking about officials here. The result, they say: Diplomats from countries with low levels of corruption tended to obey the parking laws, even when they had no chance of being punished. Sweden and Norway, among the least corrupt on Transparency International's 2005 Corruption Perceptions Index, or CPI, had perfect records. Kuwait, Chad and Bulgaria were among the 10-worst offenders; Kuwait clocked an impressive average of 246 violations per diplomat per year. These countries rank much lower on the CPI. Chad, the third-worst parking offender, is tied with Bangladesh for CPI's most corrupt.\n \n The answer then to this chicken-egg question seems to be that culture does condition certain behavior. The stereotypes fit. But, wait, not always. The Central African Republic had no unpaid parking fines, yet isn't renowned for clean government. Other countries -- Bahrain, Malaysia, Oman, and Turkey -- break the rules but then always pay the fine. Perhaps they are culturally predisposed to take responsibility for their actions. Or maybe just to buy their way out of trouble. (The unasked question is why these diplomats are always trying to park, when driving is one of the slowest ways to get around Manhattan.)\n \n The study also found that diplomats kept the attitudes they brought with them, even in new surroundings. Instead of converging toward the American attitudinal middle -- Canadians becoming bigger scofflaws, for example, and Colombians more righteous -- parking behavior persisted over time. \"Corruption norms are sticky,\" the authors conclude.\n \n So we're doomed to behave like our countrymen. Except that the authors haven't finished exploring, as they put it, \"how cultural and social backgrounds lead to long-run differences in beliefs, tastes, values, and economic decisions.\" Next up is a study of the multinational taxi drivers at New York's John F. Kennedy airport. Come to think of it, all this confirms another stereotype: There's nothing social scientists won't study these days.\nNorway and Sweden are cited as being relatively free of corruption. It is my personal observation that both Norway and Sweden are also relatively secular and not very strong on the observation of religion. The nations cited as corrupt are, one and all, very religious. There is also a great disparity between the rich and the poor within those nations.\n \n Correlations, anyone?",

Do they not? Support your statement that they don't. The article I posted a link to in the post above re: a Moslem objecting seems to suggest that they don't make exceptions on the basis of religion. You do have the same monarch, don't you?\n \n\n All I've seen about 'religion's decline' have been about church attendance; not about adherence to any and all religious belief. And, you don't have to be personally religious when you're in a nation headed by the head of a church.\n\n \n \nNow you really are clutching at straws. Are you telling me that because I live in a country whose head of state is also head of a church, that my behaviours and attitudes are religiously inflected?\n\n Certainly you've yet to show that your standard of living is linked to your lack of religion. You seem to be suggesting I'm making supposition; if guilty it is just as biased as your own... given the only 'facts' here are flawed studies.",

One of the earliest empirical studies was by Iannaccone (1991), who examined the relationship between religious attendance and the degree of religious competition in twelve predominantly Protestant countries. He showed that, in these countries, the percent of the population who regularly attended religious services increased as the number and variety of religious denominations became more diverse. Of particular interest, the countries in the sample with the lowest levels of attendance were the five with state churches (Great Britain, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark)\n http://www.txbc.org/2003Journals/Oct2003/Oct03WhatTheEvidenceSays.htm\n \n \"Religion is crucial for the creation of the public sphere, both in Britain and in India.\"\n http://www2.fmg.uva.nl/gm/articles/pvdv2000a.htm\n \n Even a site that advocates separation of church and state doesn't get it quite right...\n The poll, taken just before Halloween, found that 68 percent of Britons say they believe in ghosts and spirits of the netherworld. Fifty-five percent said they accept the existence of God.\n \n The informal survey was conducted by ChoicesUK, a British retailer. Although not statistically valid, the results mirror those of more rigorous polls taken previously in Western Europe. Religious belief is declining in many parts of the continent, and church attendance rates have plummeted.\n http://blog.au.org/religion_in_public_life/index.html\n Firstly they offer an 'informal survey', conducted by a retailer. Next they assume that religious faith is falling because of church attendences falling. This assumes that all religions are church-based. People have personal religions. Remember that this thread is not about falls in Christian belief, but the link in all religion per se to that of the happiness of the state.\n \n It may be that personal belief in ghosts, crystals, numerology, astrology etc has risen. Nothing has suggested that belief in the spiritual/non-material has dropped.\n \n In Britain Islam is, I believe on the rise, and so are other 'non-traditional' churches. Likewise, it is my understanding that some churches such as the Orthodox church are gaining new converts.\n \n Therefore, the 'link' between RELIGION (per se) and the lie of the land has not been established.",

   "Did you read the methods and the databases used to come to this \"conclusion\".\n \n It is the worst experimental design I have ever seen. It does not have proper controls. Just a bad study saying, once again, that just because two items are correlated that one must cause the other. A logical flaw as well as poor design.\n \n Yipes!\n\n \n Electrolyte asked for a response and I am following up on that.\n What is wrong with the methods and the databases? \n \n In the original article all it said was:\n \nGregory Paul, the author of the study and a social scientist, used data from the International Social Survey Programme, Gallup and other research bodies to reach his conclusions. \n \n He compared social indicators such as murder rates, abortion, suicide and teenage pregnancy.\n \n\n \n Not really enough to make any comment, really, but nothing sounds awry. What experimental design are you referring to specifically? There were no \"controls\" per se, because there was no intervention. But the comparisons were made between secular and non-secular nations, a perfectly valid thing to do as far a research design. No mention was made or implied that he was asserting causation. I don't know what measurement of correlation he was using (likely Pearson's correlation coefficient because these are parametric data) From the original article:\n \n \nRegression analyses were not executed because of the high variability of degree of correlation, because potential causal factors for rates of societal function are complex, and because it is not the purpose of this initial study to definitively demonstrate a causal link between religion and social conditions\n \n \n \n So what, exactly is your point?\n \n FYI, \n \n The methods section from the original article:\n \n \nLevels of religious and nonreligious belief and practice, and indicators of societal health and dysfunction, have been most extensively and reliably surveyed in the prosperous developed democracies (Figures 1-9). Similar data is often lacking for second and third world nations, or is less reliable. The cultural and economic similarity of the developed democracies minimizes the variability of factors outside those being examined. The approximately 800 million mostly middle class adults and children act as a massive epidemiological experiment that allows hypotheses that faith in a creator or disbelief in evolution improves or degrades societal conditions to be tested on an international scale. The extent of this data makes it potentially superior to results based on much smaller sample sizes. Data is from the 1990s, most from the middle and latter half of the decade, or the early 2000s.\n \n \n Data sources for rates of religious belief and practice as well as acceptance of evolution are the 1993 Environment I (Bishop) and 1998 Religion II polls conducted by the International Social Survey Program (ISSP), a cross-national collaboration on social science surveys using standard methodologies that currently involves 38 nations. The last survey interviewed approximately 23,000 people in almost all (17) of the developed democracies; Portugal is also plotted as an example of a second world European democracy. Results for western and eastern Germany are combined following the regions' populations. England is generally Great Britain excluding Northern Ireland; Holland is all of the Netherlands. The results largely agree with national surveys on the same subjects; for example, both ISSP and Gallup indicate that absolute plus less certain believers in a higher power are about 90% of the U.S. population. The plots include Bible literalism and frequency of prayer and service attendance, as well as absolute belief in a creator, in order to examine religiosity in terms of ardency, conservatism, and activities. Self-reported rates of religious attendance and practice may be significantly higher than actual rates (Marler and Hadaway), but the data is useful for relative comparisons, especially when it parallels results on religious belief. The high rates of church attendance reported for the Swiss appear anomalous compared to their modest levels of belief and prayer.\n \n Data on aspects of societal health and dysfunction are from a variety of well-documented sources including the UN Development Programme (2000). Homicide is the best indicator of societal violence because of the extremity of the act and its unique contribution to levels of societal fear, plus the relatively reliable nature of the data (Beeghley; Neapoletan). Youth suicide (WHO) was examined in order to avoid cultural issues related to age and terminal illness. Data on STDs, teen pregnancy and birth (Panchaud et al.; Singh and Darroch) were accepted only if the compilers concluded that they were not seriously underreported, except for the U.S. where under reporting does not exaggerate disparities with the other developed democracies because they would only close the gaps. Teen pregnancy was examined in a young age class in which marriage is infrequent. Abortion data (Panchaud et al.) was accepted only from those nations in which it is as approximately legal and available as in the U.S. In order to minimize age related factors, rates of dysfunction were plotted within youth cohorts when possible.\n \n Regression analyses were not executed because of the high variability of degree of correlation, because potential causal factors for rates of societal function are complex, and because it is not the purpose of this initial study to definitively demonstrate a causal link between religion and social conditions. Nor were multivariate analyses used because they risk manipulating the data to produce errant or desired results,<5< and because the fairly consistent characteristics of the sample automatically minimizes the need to correct for external multiple factors (see further discussion below). Therefore correlations of raw data are used for this initial examination.\n \n",

You should have read it.\n\n I did. I felt it was a pretty lame attempt at building strawmen.\n \n \nThe study is flawed because it simply focuses on the United States... which is not the most religious society; not at a govenmental level, and the 'problems' it focuses on are secular; gun-control, public health.\n\n I dealt with most of this strawman earlier. Religiosity of a government does not imply religiosity of a people.\n Second, the problems are those which the myth claims are affected by religious belief; therefore the application is consistent with the aim of the study.\n \n Speaking of the aim of the study,\nOf his own study...\"Paul says in the introduction that the paper is \"not an attempt to present a definitive study that establishes cause versus effect between religiosity, secularism and societal health.\" The study reveals correlations between various indicators of religiosity and dysfunctionality, and makes no pretensions to causation.\"\n\n \nI provided evidence of correlation.\n \n Second, the aim of the study was to test the widely-held implication that secular societies have a greater problem with immorality and crime than do religious societies.

It was sad enough when you posted this a 'fact' - given that your study was conducted by an expert on dinosaurs!!!\n\n The fallacy of appeal to authority occurs when one cites the mere opinion of someone unqualified as a credible source of evidence.

Apparently, they've never heard of Catholics. Again, if evolution inspired amorality, we'd see a correlation opposite the one we see. Even if \"Darwinism\" were a social evil, such status would have nothing to do with whether evolutionary theory is correct.\n Furthermore, your anti-anti-religion bias is revealed by your asinine flip-flopping: first, you scream that the study in question doesn't show a cause-and-effect relationship, which I had already pointed out; second, you take an alleged correlation (which I've just shown doesn't exist) and claim that a cause-and-effect relationship must exist!\n\n \n \n \nYou fail this week's reading test.\n\n This is because I refuted some of your \"arguments\" before you even made them, and because you insist that you have responded to my points when it is quite evident that you have not.\n \n \nYou also fail this week's logic test.\n\n This is because you built numerous strawmen and falsely accused me of a fallacy while simultaneously committing several yourself.\n \n When your summation of arguments consists solely of logical fallacies, such as can be seen here, I don't get too worried.",

Your accusing me of not recognizing the claim further supports the idea that you have some trouble reading.\n \n Furthermore, nothing in the quotation speaks to causation, which you assure us is addressed. Is this still more evidence that you have trouble reading?",

   "You should note that when I make no claim, and only quote him, it's not a straw-man argument.\n\n \nWhen you are listing a number of alleged problems, and you include the \"does not show causation\" claim -- complete with artificially large font -- it looks a lot like you intend it to be a pertinent part of your argument. When one makes an argument against what is not being claimed, it is a strawman.\n\n \n He didn't argue that there was causation, as I quoted. I am not arguing against that, because I am the one who quoted that.. You still wish to believe that is a straw-man, that's fine.\n \n \nYou've not acknowledged your mistake.\n\n \nThe only apparent mistake I'll acknowledge is my assuming you were trying to make some point with your big-font spiel. How silly of me to think that you thought you were making some relevant statement.\n\n I am making a statement. That's why I quoted him. He says there's no causation. How silly indeed of you to continually think that I am saying otherwise.\n \n You have still yet to properly address this Appeal to Authority. But I will examine his findings. He cites http://www.csdp.org/research/hosb1203.pdf as a study on crime rates, and declares...\n \"The especially low rates in the more Catholic European states are statistical noise due to yearly fluctuations incidental to this sample, and are not consistently present in other similar tabulations (Barcley and Tavares)\"\n http://moses.creighton.edu/JRS/2005/2005-11.html\n This 'summation' of the evidence is based on his own opinion, given strength by the loosely termed 'Catholic European states\". Page 3 of that very study of Barcley/Tavares shows over-all crime in Italy fell. Let's assume Italy is a \"Catholic European state\" :) this therefore is evidence against his assumptions. In fact, in his main gripe, the 'religious' USA, crime also over-all fell. France, nominally Catholic, but certainly European, crime rose.\n \n Page 4 shows drug-trafficking having its highest rise in Finland; another non-religious northern European state. And on the same page domestic burglary has its highest falls in Greece (assuming that it's very Orthodox still). Robbery is up in England and Wales (one of his 'show-pony' examples of evolution-loving secularist Europe). Thus a study he cites doesn't help his cause. But then you should now be used to him citing studies that don't help out. Before we deal with that, let's take one more look at one of his 'factors' of dysfunctionality... STDs.\n \n He talks about STD rates being far higher in the USA. China, a quite anti-religious nation has increasing rates of STDs.\n \"The sexual behavior revealed in the report bodes ill for HIV/AIDS infection rates. \"Were the current growth rates to continue, absolute numbers of individuals with HIV infection in China will surpass current numbers in the United States within two years and those in South Africa [currently the highest] within a decade,\" said co-author Edward Laumann of the University of Chicago.\"\n http://www.aegis.com/news/ads/2003/AD030496.html\n \n \nThe issue of 'causation' is set out below. (I quoted this already). I quoted in that post #12 which you've still not recognised\n \n \"In a paper last year, economists Robert Barro and Rachel McCleary...found that economic performance was largely unrelated to the dominant religious theology of the nation.\"\n This is sourced at\n http://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/re/2004/c/pages/fear_of_hell.html \n\n \nI haven't recognized it? Are you sure?\n\n \n No, you've beaten around it. False dichotomies arise\n \n \nYes, Barro and McCleary found that economic performance is not strongly correlated with religion.\n But Paul was not focusing on economic performance; \n\n \n Economics, per se play a large part. He is looking to the USA, a high economic performer and suggesting that its social services are poor. What you wish us to believe is that economics has no relation to the way government spends on social services. You are bringing the wedge of a false dichotomy and slowly hoping to drive it in. Paul uses both terms in side-by-side \"The most theistic prosperous democracy, the U.S., is exceptional.\"\n http://moses.creighton.edu/JRS/2005/2005-11.html. It is a 'prosperous' nation. It is the MOST prosperous of nations.\n \n Dysfunctionality for Paul is measured in a number of economic factors; public spending, for example. Economics is intertwined with a society; you would hope otherwise. But he also looks at others as well, such as corruption; which is however shown in both the USA, (an example supporting his argument) and the Netherlands (an example of one of Paul's ideal less religious, pro-evolutionist European nations). There is thus correlations in the USA, but not in the Netherlands.\n \n Also critical are laws that promote good corporate governance by imposing harsh penalties against firms or government officials that have enriched themselves from illegal or immoral activities. When these public and private institutions are lacking, or not very well-developed, there tend to be high levels of corruption and financial malfeasance, which can create economic uncertainty and destroy wealth. Recent examples of corruption and other misconduct can be found even in advanced economies, as in the United States (Enron, Tyco and WorldCom), Italy (Parmalat) and the Netherlands (Ahold).\n http://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/re/2004/c/pages/fear_of_hell.html\n \n The whole article, which concluded re: Robert Barro goes on about how good economies thrive; your champion is arguing that the USA (the thriving economy) is doing so despite high levels of dysfunctionality.\n \n I suppose your best hoped for argument is a belief that all the economic wealth of America is not really due to people's religiosity, but how they spend it is (as they spend it poorly on social services). Sort of dividing the economy into 'money in' and 'money out'. Given you have the same society concerned with both then your hopes rest on a false dichotomy. And this is the real flaw in your dinosaur-man's opus. He seeks only that evidence that confirms his own beliefs; in that nation where evolution isn't properly accepted (his major gripe).",

   "You have still yet to properly address this Appeal to Authority.\n\n Okay, one more, just for the ones who have trouble reading. This time I'll quote wikipedia instead of my own explanation.\n \n \nAn appeal to authority is a type of argument in logic also known as argument from authority, argumentum ad verecundiam (Latin: argument to respect) or ipse dixit (Latin: he himself said it, where an unsupported assertion depends on the asserter's credibility). [bolded color added]\n\n This claim is not unsupported, therefore it is not an appeal to authority.\n However, I am glad to see that you've \"elected\" to move past this and actually question the support, which is the only avenue of argumentation that you should have pursued anyway.\n \n \nHe cites http://www.csdp.org/research/hosb1203.pdf as a study on crime rates, and declares...\n \"The especially low rates in the more Catholic European states are statistical noise due to yearly fluctuations incidental to this sample, and are not consistently present in other similar tabulations (Barcley and Tavares)\"\n\n Now you are quote mining. The sentence you quote refers to homicide rates, not \"over-all\" crime rates.A few hundred years ago rates of homicide were astronomical in Christian Europe and the American colonies (Beeghley; R. Lane). In all secular developed democracies a centuries long-term trend has seen homicide rates drop to historical lows (Figure 2). The especially low rates in the more Catholic European states are statistical noise due to yearly fluctuations incidental to this sample, and are not consistently present in other similar tabulations (Barcley and Tavares). Despite a significant decline from a recent peak in the 1980s (Rosenfeld), the U.S. is the only prosperous democracy that retains high homicide rates, making it a strong outlier in this regard (Beeghley; Doyle, 2000). [bold added]\nTry again.\n \n \nThis 'summation' of the evidence is based on his own opinion, given strength by the loosely termed 'Catholic European states\". Page 3 of that very study of Barcley/Tavares shows over-all crime in Italy fell. Let's assume Italy is a \"Catholic European state\" this therefore is evidence against his assumptions. In fact, in his main gripe, the 'religious' USA, crime also over-all fell. France, nominally Catholic, but certainly European, crime rose.\n\n Then you tell us specifically which data points are troublesome for Paul, but do so without referring to generic \"over-all crime,\" which was not part of the study. More importantly, a change in rate is not the rate; as I quoted above, though the change in the U.S. homicide rate has been negative, the rate is wildly higher than that of other countries.\n \n \nPage 4 shows drug-trafficking having its highest rise in Finland;\n\n You are still talking about change in rate, not rate.\n \n \nHe talks about STD rates being far higher in the USA. China, a quite anti-religious nation has increasing rates of STDs.\n\n You consider China a \"prosperous democracy\"? Interesting...\n Furthermore, yet again you are actually (first) talking about increasing rates, not high rates. Moreover, the citation refers to the absolute numbers of individuals, not rates. As China well exceeds both the U.S. and South Africa in population, the rate is still lower.\n \n \nEconomics, per se play a large part. ...\n\n It doesn't matter if economics play a large part. The study reveals the correlation between religiosity and social dysfunction.\n If you want to insist that Barro/McCleary study shows a positive correlation between a strong economy and religiosity, go ahead. I'll then cite the Paul study that religiosity and dysfunctionality have a positive correlation, which could in turn suggest that social dysfunction has a positive correlation with a strong economy... You see, this doesn't really help you, does it?\n \n \nYou are bringing the wedge of a false dichotomy and slowly hoping to drive it in.\n\n By telling you that social dysfunction and economics are different? Would you like to direct me to a dictionary that tells me they're the same?\n \n \nDysfunctionality for Paul is measured in a number of economic factors; public spending, for example.\n\n Please cite in context the specific passage where Paul explains this, and tell us how it plays into the methodology.\n \n \nAlso critical are laws that promote good corporate governance by imposing harsh penalties against firms or government officials that have enriched themselves from illegal or immoral activities.\n\n This is why the study focused on \"prosperous democracies,\" and not, say, China.\n \n \nThe whole article, which concluded re: Robert Barro goes on about how good economies thrive; your champion is arguing that the USA (the thriving economy) is doing so despite high levels of dysfunctionality.\n\n So the entire second half of your post is just a belligerent spiel about how religiosity is good for a country's economy? How is this any argument against Paul's findings? Or maybe you're trying to say that having a good economy is more important than having reasonable murder rates, teen pregnancy rates, abortion rates, STD infection rates, and juvenile mortality rates? I'm afraid I can't tell.\n \n \nGiven you have the same society concerned with both then your hopes rest on a false dichotomy.\n\n I'm afraid you'll have to do a better job of explaining this alleged false dichotomy.

   "If I'm all bluff, how come you've had to abandon the vast majority of your arguments because of my refutations of them?\n\n Indeed I have only pressed on with some arguments. I had almost given up pursuing your mistake of calling my argument 'straw-man', when I actually quote the author. You probably thought that was a victory. \n \n Others, such as where I talk about the false dichotomy, you simply retort that I can't read/understand/write. You probably believe that's an argument; perhaps even you feel that your time is too valuable to deal with such as I. I have not really pursued your 'retorts' there either. Like your repost 'more random words'. When I cited him saying that there's no causation, you asked if I had a point. I did. It's to say that there's no causation. Whilst I thought that the straight-forward logic of this was clear, it isn't on you, so I'll have to spell this out too.\n \n Your initial citation is a newspaper link. What does it say?\n \"RELIGIOUS belief can cause damage to a society, contributing towards high murder rates, abortion, sexual promiscuity and suicide, according to research published today.\"\n http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1798944,00.html\n \n Therefore you cite a link saying that there is causation. I cite him talking about his own study saying that there is none in direct reaction your link.\n \n \"Paul says in the introduction that the paper is \"not an attempt to present a definitive study that establishes cause versus effect between religiosity, secularism and societal health.\" The study reveals correlations between various indicators of religiosity and dysfunctionality, and makes no pretensions to causation.\"\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_S._Paul\n \n You called this posting of mine a straw-man. When I point out your mistake, you insist on it. You don't retract this mistake. You go on, once your hackles are up. When I stop pursuing this, you ask why I'm abandoning the 'vast majority of (my) arguments\". You even narrow in on the fact that I put this in a different font. Indeed I did. You insist for days that I can't read, don't know this or that, etc. and that you've addressed this. His quote directly refutes your initial citation. Though you admit that he does indeed suggest that there's no causation. You think that when I stop pursuing your mistake here, it's a victory. You think when I stop pursuing the fact you falsely claimed a 'straw-man' is a victory. Well, now I'm reasserting this! Why not indeed? You've made several mistakes here, and you just go on bluff and bravado to believe you can hammer your opponent into submission. This simply is not the way I'm used to conducting debate. I admit the mistakes I have made. You admit none.\n \n Succinctly;\n a) citing him is not a straw-man\n b) citing him refutes your newspaper citation.\n \n If you accept that he claims no causation then you refute your own initial evidence. I thought that this was apparent, but you think it is 'straw-man'. ROFL. I suppose if you just refute this with more disgruntled posting and I am too bored to reply you can holler 'victory'.\n \n \nHe cited the study because he used the numbers for homicide rates. I made this very obvious with bolding. How nice of you to ignore it.\n \n\n I didn't. If you want to now claim special privilege in only looking at one small part of a large study he cited, that's again up to you. Imagine my surprise that you would do this, despite me already pointing out selective use of evidence.\n \n He links this site directly to his claim about 'statistical noise', not that I've not mentioned this already. The study itself deals with a large number of things. Change in rates of all sorts of crime. I looked to the study, the bits he has selectively chosen not to address. I dealt with this in a prior post. Your response was to whinge about the difference between 'rates' and 'changes in rates' (see also below), or you've ignored it entirely (excepting to respond with bluff, which is not a retort)\n \n Another bit which I've not mentioned, but would like to address. He states\n \"Other prosperous democracies do not significantly exceed the U.S. in rates of non-violent and in non-lethal violent crime (Beeghley; Farrington and Langan; Neapoletan), and are often lower in this regard.\"\n \n As you're happy dealing with 'rates' per se and not changes in 'rates', we can look at the clever spin he puts on this... \"do not significantly exceed the US\" means that they do exceed the US.\n http://moses.creighton.edu/JRS/2005/2005-11.html\n \n \nI have a hard time believing that you truly have that much difficulty with basic concepts of math. You can't be for real. Do I really need to explain it to you, or do you have a fourth-grade math book handy?\n\n You miss the point. I'm not talking about maths, per se. I'm talking about the use of one measure to suit you in one circumstance, and one measure in another. You can read this in conjunction with the quote above.\n \n You want to talk about 'overall rates' and then ignore those 'overall rates' when it doesn't suit you... as he just did when he says \"do not significantly exceed the US\" which means overall they do exceed the US. How much simpler can I put it? I assumed you'd read the study.\n \n \nThus you and he wish to say that the USA is 'dysfunctional' in a healthy economy!\n\n \n \nBy his definition of \"dysfunctional,\" that's precisely what he's saying. There is no reason that an economically healthy society can't have problems with abortion, murder, juvenile death, STDs, etc.\n\n I understand this. I mentioned this a few posts back. I talked of his attempt at a false dichotomy. Your rebuff was a few bluff words. It doesn't change the fact that the study he cites says that the economy of the USA can only be healthy when there is a strong society. I guess it's worth re-citing.\n http://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/re/2004/c/pages/fear_of_hell.html\n \n Given that a study he cites says that an economy such as the USA is healthy because of strong social services, etc. then it is \n \n \nSo you have been holding back an explanation for why an \"economically healthy\" society cannot have problems with these other issues?

You have yet to show why this site he cites is not to be believed.\n \n \n\n More random words?\n\n I guess your response is. Is that a trick?\n \n \n\n I'm shocked.

I've already cited where I re-viewed the findings re: particular countries (post #55)\n \nRight, as in \"yearly fluctuations\" (which you quoted), not overall trends. This does not help your point.\n\n If you say so; however you're quick to forget this laughable challenge...\n \nI'll just stop you here to ask: Where does Paul quote \"rates in change\" or even change in rates? As if I didn't have my doubts before, now I seriously suspect you of being incapable of understanding numbers.\n\n He is indeed dealing with 'rates in change', although you want to believe 'yearly fluctuations' means something else. That is, of course, entirely up to you. You asked me to show him mentioning it. I did. You ignore it.\n \n \nI pointed out that this study that he himself quotes Barcley and Tavares, and that I examine this for myself and see that these fluctuations show best improvements in the USA.\n\n \n\"Improvements\" refer to changes in rates, not rates. In fact, I already quoted where Paul says that the change in homicide rate in the U.S. is negative, yet the rate is still much, much higher than in other countries.\n\n Yawn. Seems I'll have to go over this one more time. It doesn't matter. He says the USA is dysfunctional. He cites a study that shows rates of change. The USA is improving more so than his 'champion' secularist European nations. He is his own study pursues the line that the USA is dysfunctional because of certain parameters, even though his own sources say that those are improving. If they are improving and you can show that religiosity is decreasing over the same period, you'd have a point.\n \n The 'correlations' he therefore shows are highly selective. Over-all rate supports his study. Change in rate (which he sources) doesn't; but he doesn't directly use this in his study except to say that\n \nClever? No. Mathematically competent? Yes.\n\n You have invested a great effort now in defending this \"Appeal to Authority\"\n \n In summary.\n \n You cite an article that refers to a study. This is refuted by the author of the study, who says that there's no causation. You harp on endlessly about how I've created a straw-man. I point out I quoted him. You make a big deal about the fact I used a large font and say I must have done so for a reason. I say, yes I have, because it shows there's no causation. This is, as I say, a refutation of the newspaper article you chose to cite.\n \n We look at the study's author. He's not an expert in this field, in fact his expertise is in an entirely different discipline. He has a 'cause bellum' regarding the way creation is being taught/believed in the USA. You claim it's not an \"Appeal to Authority\" because he 'supports' his views. When we go into looking at this 'support' you believe I've dropped that argument. It actually goes to show that his argument is not supported, and therefore an \"Appeal to Authority.\"\n \n He cites an article that talks about how strong the US economy is. You say that this doesn't refute his study because 'dysfunctionality' and 'economy' are different (his study dealing with one, the citation dealing with the other) (making me wonder why he's citing it, if it doesn't support his argument about 'dysfunctionality, but let's press on). This Reserve Bank citation says that the USA has a strong economy precisely because of the strength of its institutions, social bonds etc. You think this doesn't refute his study because there's some dichotomy between how a society gets its wealth (which you believe has nothing to do with religion) and how it spends it (which has everything to do with the evils of religion).\n \n He cites another study about one type of crime but which also deals with rates of change in a whole range of crimes. I look to these, and point out particular pages that shows rates falling in what are (probably) the more religious of the nations mentioned. You re-state that this study was only being used to support one set of figures. Funny that. That's nothing to do with selectivity. You state that it's only to do with 'rates' and not 'change in rates' but a few sentences later he admits that 'rates' in other categories do exceed the US. One of the few honest admissions from your side of the argument.\n \n Then you harp on about the differences between 'rates' and 'rates of change' and dare me to show you where he is dealing with the latter. I do, I quote him talking about 'yearly fluctuations'. Another of your mistakes, but you press on. You want to differentiate now between 'yearly fluctuations' and 'overall trends' DESPITE saying before that the statistics are tied only to one set of figures - homicide rates. Over-all trends is what the whole citation deal with. They are falling. But wait, you don't want to talk about 'over-all trends' but 'rates over-all'. And around we go as you desperately grope about for the right set of figures; only those that support your dinosaur-man's claim. Ignoring all the others.\n \n He cites other rates that exceed the USA. Although he spins this into 'not excessively'. They still exceed the USA. That is the problem with his 'facts' is that he hones in one set that seems to support his rant, but then rather meekly moves the others aside. Even you wanted to press the point that the whole site he cites is to be considered only as support for one set of factors. ROFL\n \n Add to this your retorts of bluff and bravado! At least you are keeping me entertained.\n \n In short; rates of change don't give over-all support to his argument. Rates, per se don't either.\n \n His own cited works say that the USA is stronge economically because of the structures of its society.\n \n And he himself refutes your own original post... oh that's right. That's a straw-man :)",

   "Others, such as where I talk about the false dichotomy, you simply retort that I can't read/understand/write.\n\n Because, despite pleas, you can't seem to come up with some coherent explanation of why it's a false dichotomy.\n \n \nWhen I cited him saying that there's no causation, you asked if I had a point. I did. It's to say that there's no causation.\n\n Right, but that point had already been covered before you pointed it out. Your delivery of it suggested that it somehow undermined the study. It does not.\n \n \n\"RELIGIOUS belief can cause damage to a society, contributing towards high murder rates, abortion, sexual promiscuity and suicide, according to research published today.\"\n\n You're right: the journalist screwed up. That's a problem we tend to have with publicizing science: journalists and reporters don't know enough about either the field or about science in general. When you read the actual quotations, Paul clearly says \"correlation\" and not \"causation.\"\n \n \nPaul says in the introduction that the paper is \"not an attempt to present a definitive study that establishes cause versus effect between religiosity, secularism and societal health.\" ...\n\n I am not denying this. Why do you keep repeating it as if you're showing that I'm wrong?\n \n \nYou called this posting of mine a straw-man.\n\n See above.\n \n \nThough you admit that he does indeed suggest that there's no causation.\n\n Where does he suggest that there's no causation, rather than not supporting causation? The two are certainly not the same.\n \n \nYou think that when I stop pursuing your mistake here, it's a victory.\n\n No, you're already wrong on this no matter how much you argue. I've asked you to address substantive matters of the study, which is what you'd be doing if you had any objections that stand up.\n \n \nI didn't. If you want to now claim special privilege in only looking at one small part of a large study he cited, that's again up to you.\n\n If you only need information from one page of a textbook, are you required to use every bit of information in that textbook? No. Paul used the data that was applicable to his study.\n \n \nYour response was to whinge about the difference between 'rates' and 'changes in rates' (see also below), or you've ignored it entirely (excepting to respond with bluff, which is not a retort)\n\n If you still don't understand that changes in rates have no necessary correlation with the rate itself, I'm afraid I can't help you. I've already used the example Paul used, and you only ignore it.\n \n \n\"Other prosperous democracies do not significantly exceed the U.S. in rates of non-violent and in non-lethal violent crime (Beeghley; Farrington and Langan; Neapoletan), and are often lower in this regard.\"\n As you're happy dealing with 'rates' per se and not changes in 'rates', we can look at the clever spin he puts on this... \"do not significantly exceed the US\" means that they do exceed the US.\n\n Right; I think pointing this out is perfectly valid: Why, if all these other crime rates are lower in the U.S., is the rate of homicide -- a particularly brutal crime -- higher in the U.S.? Is homicide more acceptable here (compared to other countries) than are these other crimes? Again, how does that support your point?\n \n \nYou miss the point. I'm not talking about maths, per se. I'm talking about the use of one measure to suit you in one circumstance, and one measure in another.\n\n Your mistake lies in your utter ignorance of mathematics, which is why I am talking about math. (Perhaps I shouldn't bother trying to teach one who refuses to learn.) An erratic change in rates means that there is no trend, that the rate fluctuates, sort of like the stock market fluctuates on a daily basis. Paul is explaining that his numbers happened to catch a low spot, but they are not wholly representative of reality. He backs this up by citing the Barclay study. This is like saying that even though the stock market happened to be at some high or low level some point in time, a longer-term picture shows that that particular level is atypical and not representative of the actual average level.\n \n \nBy his definition of \"dysfunctional,\" that's precisely what he's saying. There is no reason that an economically healthy society can't have problems with abortion, murder, juvenile death, STDs, etc.\n\n ... Given that a study he cites says that an economy such as the USA is healthy because of strong social services, etc. then it is \n\n A better way to put this would be that the citation says that the USA is economically healthy because of strong social services. This doesn't counter my question, but I'll reword it anyway: How does having \"strong social services\" necessarily prevent above-average problems with abortion, murder, juvenile deaths, STDs, etc.?\n Let's carry this out, because we have another reduction to absurdity. If either a healthy economy or strong social services prevented these \"dysfunctional\" problems, and the U.S. has either a healthy economy or strong social services (or both), then the U.S. would not have these dysfunction problems. However, the U.S. does have these problems. It's another modus tollens, and you'll have to reject a premise:\n A: that the U.S. has either a healthy economy or strong social programs\n B: that the U.S. has problems with murder, abortion, etc.\n C: that a healthy economy/strong social programs prevent problems with murder, abortion, etc.\n Pick any two, but pick ones based on data.\n You'll pick A and C, with numbers only for A. I'll pick A and B, with numbers for both.\n \n \nYou have yet to show why this site he cites is not to be believed.\n\n I don't have to. As I explained above, you have yet to show why that site undermines his findings.\n \n \nThey don't. I've already cited where I re-viewed the findings re: particular countries (post #55)\n\n No, you reviewed the change in rates, remember?\n \n \nHe is indeed dealing with 'rates in change', although you want to believe 'yearly fluctuations' means something else. That is, of course, entirely up to you. You asked me to show him mentioning it. I did. You ignore it.\n\n I didn't ignore it; I said that you showed a faint glimmer of comprehension. However, your previous delivery had suggested that Paul used changes in rates where he should have used rates. He did not; this is an error only you have made. As explained above, Paul used a reference to changes in rates only to correct a statistical anomaly. He showed that the rate increases and decreases erratically in these countries; he is not using the change in rates in leiu of the rates. You, however, are. You are using negative changes in rates to argue that the rates must be low, even though this is demonstrably untrue.\n \n \nThe 'correlations' he therefore shows are highly selective. Over-all rate supports his study. Change in rate (which he sources) doesn't; but he doesn't directly use this in his study except to say that\n\n I have textbooks that explain rates of change versus change. Some of them also contain basic and advanced physics and calculus; am I unable to reference any of these textbooks without relating general relativity to social dysfunction? Get real. As long as I don't contradict or misrepresent data, not citing every last datum is not an offense.\n As I said above, you are using negative changes in rates to argue that the rates must be low, even though this is demonstrably untrue; changes in rates do not tell us whether a rates are high or low. They do not contradict Paul's findings.",

Now you recognise that his cited study is torn apart!\n I just posted...\n \nDid you read the methods and the databases used to come to this \"conclusion\".\n \n It is the worst experimental design I have ever seen. It does not have proper controls. Just a bad study saying, once again, that just because two items are correlated that one must cause the other. A logical flaw as well as poor design.\n \n Yipes!\n\n \n \n\n One of the databases gets a serve at\n The Washington Monthly\n http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2004_07/004413.php\n one blogger says it really well\n \"torture the data ... and it will confess!\"\n\n \n Bahaa-haa-haa! It's a study that your dinosaur-man made use of. Oh, that's right. I'm wrong to use it. But he's not!\n \nRemember public spending is an issue of economics, not dysfunctionality, despite one apologists claims that the study is merely about the latter.\n\n \n\n Go ahead and read that sentence again. It makes no sense. How does A being an issue of B and not C contradict claims that D is about only C? Oh, wait, you failed logic too. I won't hold my breath for an explanation.\n\n \n Public spending is a factor of economics. Public spending also has a bearing on dysfunctionality. You said that the study had nothing to do with economics, by dysfunctionality. I said that this was creating a false dichotomy because it is part of both. Now you're undecided??? emoticon_confused LOL",

The US embassy has said it does not intend to pay the fees, instead claiming diplomatic privilege. ... The mayor said US staff should pay the congestion charge as UK staff pay road tolls in the US. ... The US embassy is number one on the list for fees not paid in the past six months. \n \n \n Second is Nigeria, third Angola.\n\n \n Johnhanks I will address you as you immediately responded to Simone's comment above, Angola is not a religious nation, but is a recovering Marxist state; it was formerly known as the People's Republic of Angola (it's map is has communist symbology). Also on the top 5 of your own site is Switzerland, home indeed of Calvinism, but a secular state; I believe.\n \n There is nothing to suggest that the governments of these nations are 'religious' in the some cases; the USA has separation of church and state.\n \n A study I posted some short while ago also covers but a small area of research; people's honesty and openness in matters economic. It suggests that religion is related to honesty.\n \n \n *-electrolyte's own site not only doesn't give any correlation to the OP, but itself misrepresents the study it draws upon.",

You were the one who pointed to an article that Paul cited for reference -- but not for evidential support -- and said that it went against Paul's point.
