   "The economic system of the body of Christ is communism. \n \n Scripture quotes come from the ESV. \n \n Acts 2:44,45 states, \nAnd all who believed were together and had all things in common. And they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as any had need.\n\n \n Acts 4:32,34 states, \nNow the full number of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one said that any of the things that belonged to him was his own, but they had everything in common. There was not a needy person among them, for as many as were owners of lands or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of what was sold and laid it at the apostles' feet, and it was distributed to each as as any had need.\n \n \n And you probably thought, \"From each according to his ability, to each according to his need,\" started with Karl Marx. I don't know if it started with the church, but it is documented here, long before Karl Marx. And you, as well as I were taught the Karl Marx was wrong. The only thing he was wrong about was who should administer the redistribution of wealth. He thought it should be the government. In the early church, it was the apostles. Eventually, deacons would do this. \n \n The principle goal of early Christians was the edification (bulding up) of the body of Christ. There were no individual rights. Everything was done for edification. \n \n Romans 14:19 states, \nSo then let us pursue what makes for peace and for mutual upbuilding.\n Get that! Mutual upbuilding or edification. The buliding up of one another. This is what the early church did, and this is what they were told to do. \n \n Romans 15:1,2 states, \nWe who are strong have an obligation to bear with the failings of the weak, and not to please ourselves. Let each of us please his neighbor for his good, to build him up.\n \"Build him up,\" or edify him. \n \n I Corinthians 14:12, \nSo with yourselves, since you are eager for manifestations of the Spirit, strive to excel in building up the church.\n Building up, or edification of the church. \n \n I Corinthians 14:26, \nWhat then, When you come together, each one has a hymn, a lesson, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up.\n Once again, building up, or edification. \n \n I Thessalonians 5:11, \nTherefore encourage one another, and build up one another, just as you are doing.\n Again, build up one another. \n \n You can also read Ephesians 4:1-16. \n \n So, scripture teaches, by doctrine and example, that Christians are to have all things in common, and that all things should be done for the building up or the edification of body of Christ. \n \n We have no individual rights in the church. We are a community of believers. How is this established? \n \n Acts 20:28 states, \nPay carefull attention to yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to care for the church of God, which He obtained with His own blood.\n Jesus obtained or purchased the church of God with His blood. That means He has ownership of the church. So, we who are in the church, belong to Him. And, since we are purchased equally, that is, He paid a common price for each of us, we have common value. None of us are more or less important than another. That is how it is established that we have all things in common. For we are commonly owned by Him who purchased us with His blood. \n \n This was acted out in all ways by the earliest Christians, including economically, as we have seen in Acts 2 and 4. \n \n But we are Americans. We don't believe this. We believe in individual rights. We believe the poor should pick themselves up by their own boot straps. That those who do not have a job do not deserve our help. We certainly should not help those who are suffering due to their own failings. This is the conservative view. I here it on conservative talk radio all the time. But this should not be the Christian view. Yet, the so called \"religious right,\" mirrors this conservative view. They condemn those who agree with the concept of the redistribution of wealth. They fear what they perceive as communism. \n \n Would you believe that Jesus taught the redistribution of wealth as a condition to inherit eternal life? Read Luke 18:18ff. \n \n This is the story of the rich ruler. The ruler came to Jesus and aked Him what he must do to inherit eternal life. Jesus asked him about the commandments, which the ruler said that he kept them all his life. Then Jesus said, \"One thing you still lack. Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come follow me.\" \n \n The early Christians did just that, as we see in Acts 2 and 4. So, why isn't this being practiced by the church today? Is it more important to build satellite TV networks? Is it more important to build multi-million dollar church buildings? Is it more important to have a new car every year? Is it more important to keep up with the latest fashions? And, I could go on and on. We are comfort creatures. Many care more about their own creature comforts, than they do the needs of others. \n \n Philippians 2:4 states, \nLet each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others.\n As Christians we must concern ourselves with the interests of others. We must help those who can not help themselves. For we in Christ are part of each other, as we have been prchased by the same blood. \n \n I realize the term \"Christian Communism\" might raise some eyebrows, and maybe anger some folks. Maybe it would be better to change the name of this article to, \"Christian Communion.\" But what would be the difference be? The words communism, communion, communication and community all have the same root word - \"commune.\" They suggest a common union where people have all things in common. \n \n Sandycane wrote in another thread: \nI think it means god is the head and we as individuals and as a group make up the body - as in 'a body of water'. In a body of water, each droplet of water is the same as the other. They each behave exactly the same as directed by the laws of Nature. You can't have equal portions of vinegar, bleach and water and call it pure water.\n \n Even if you say each individual is a 'separate' member of the body, each member will behave the way the head directs it to - if the head tells you killing is wrong, you can't have the right hand say it's okay sometimes and the other hand say it's always wrong.\n \n If I want to walk a straight line, my right foot will not stay put while the left steps forward. They will do as directed by my head.\n\n \n She obviously understands the \"one body\" aspect to Christianity. And that is the premise for this article.\n \n I just want to add this. When an individual drop of water joins a greater body of water, it then becomes indistinquishable from the greater whole. And so it is with the true body of Christ.\n \n Now it's your turn.\n \n :)",

   "Not a lot to disagree with, except that I was never taught that Marx was wrong (at least, not as far as that quotation goes). I also disagree with you that the government shouldn't be involved in it. If people think that is the best way to administer society, for religious or secular reasons, then why shouldn't we do that? It's also worth mentioning that Marx envisaged the state as administrator being a temporary phenomenon, forecasting the withering away of the state, and a system where people worked and provided what was needed for each other voluntarily, much as the early church did.\n \n I certainly agree about building vast, extravagant churches. Churches buildings should be near the people they serve, and should be designed to facilitate worshipping God and serving their community. They should not be adverts for the wealth of their builders. There is certainly know point in having Christian broadcasting unless the church is active in the communities of the people watching.",

   "I can see what Sandycane is saying.\n \n There is one supreme deity. But, mankind in our limited understand can't understand Him. So, based on our limited knowledge and understanding, we create a God. That is why there are so many religions in the world. \n \n Through a brief class I took on comparitive religion, it seems that the foundations of all them is the acceptance of a supreme deity or deities. We see the same thing within \"Christianity.\" Why all the denominations? It's because, even though we have the written word, we still have the same lack of understanding. For example, there is Calvinism, that claims God is totally sovereign in the affairs of mankind. We don't even buy toothpaste outside of what God has already pre-planned. On the other hand, there are those who believe that man has a totally free will, that God has left us to our own devices and if we stumble on the truth - that's great. And, of course, there are various views along that particular spectrum. But it is all based the human understanding of what is written.\n \n So what humanity is doing is creating a god in their image. And there are as many images of God as there are views of what is written. \n \n Sandycane, am I right about what you are saying?\n \n ;)\n\n \n Pretty much covers it emoticon_xgood ...except for this: 'There is one supreme deity'\n That has yet to be proven.;)\n \nBut it is all based the human understanding of what is written.\n \n\n I would add...'what is written' - by humans.\n \n I think the religious have created (many different ones over time and for different cultures) their own gods; what they think a god should be and what humans should aspire to be...either on this earth or in another life.\n Someone to look up to, to put it simply.\n \n The non religious, for whatever reason, don't need an invented god to serve as a roll model to be the best they can be.\n \n Of course, some fail miserably: both religious and nonreligious.emoticon_rolleyes\n \n edit: Actually, this is one possibility which gives humans the benefit of the doubt that their intentions were good.

   "Firstly I never called you stupid. The questions I ask, I ask because their answers are important to me. I really want to know, so whenever the opportunity arises, I ask them. \n \n Apart from philosophical questions my other interests are literature, films, and art. Yesterday, I watched once again \"La Jetee\" (\"The Pier\", the airline pier at Orly airport) in YouTube (the French original with subtitles in Spanish.) which is a masterpiece of film making. I know, you haven't seen it and couldn't care less. I mention it as an example to show that no one here is interested in the topics that matter to me. Not because of this, I call you stupid. \n Anyhow, why be here banging my head against a wall of indifference ?\n Good question.\n \n But, going back once again and for the last time, to the subject in question:\n \n \n \n No one, and by that I mean absolutely no one, knows how life began and no one knows of course, what is this 'property' of matter that caused the first aminoacids to form and, the jump from there to RNA is of course another big blank. The question 'where molecules and atoms have this property to organize themselves in structures which later give rise to life?\" is another question to toss into the \"WAY TOO HARD\" basket. We haven't answered all the 'how's and the 'why?'s, forget it. Your guess is as good as mine.\n \n Another crumbled paper in the \"WAY TOO HARD\" basket is the question of the nature of mathematics (are they real or invented ?) and, why they are so effective in describing our physical world when they themselves are metaphysical ? \n \n These so called 'gaps' are huge explanatory gaps. There is a lot of room there for God to fit in. I am not talking about the Biblical God but something more subtle, more profound, more mysterious than our Biblical creation. \n \n There is an underlying or intrinsic to it intelligence in our universe. there is also 'something' (I don't know what else to call it) that gives rise to life under the right circumstances, maybe it is the same intelligence? who knows how and why?\n \n I don't think we will ever be able to read and understand the so called 'mind of God\" for the day we could we would obviously become God.\n \n I leave you with some thoughts about mathematics and its nature.

   "Excellent, posting did work that time. Moving on. \n \n Didymus - te salutant! Great to see someone else getting the point. \n \n I think I may have spotted that in the new testament language about the building up of the church (or up-building; like there's a difference, or need for such an inversion) back in my teens in which case thanks for the reminder, and in any case well reasoned. Up-building as whollistic and implicitly including physical and material well being and capability of each. Yes absolutely. \n \n I'm of the view, and there is plenty of historical evidence for this, that there always have been Christian communists in every major tradition as well as out among the sectaries (Moravians, Taborites, Jesus Army and such), and that this is so because scripture includes such a stance. \n \n As to the scriptural case, that is brilliantly reviewed by Jose Porfirio Miranda in Communism in the Bible, Wipf & Stock 2004. Also check out Miranda's fantastic, albeit hefty, El Cristianismo del Marx published in English as Marx against the Marxists: The Christian Humanism of Karl Marx. The legacy of left/socialist theology has been well covered by John Marsden in his right-on-the-money Marxian and Christian Utopianism: Towards a Socialist Political Theology (Monthly Review Press 1991). Although Marsden for some reason left Miranda out of his review of (mostly British and German) pro-revolutionary theologians, which is why it took me another couple of years to stumble upon Jose P Miranda. Perhaps the Jesuit giant of Mexican philosophy had just escaped his notice. \n \n The first question arising is that of whether or not scripture is contradictory about rich-and-poor/property/wickedness/injustice. Is there in fact the rightist stance on the human socio-economic represented there also? Most people assume it must be. Actually it's transparently clear on checking that there is only one perception of the human socio-economic represented throughout scripture consistently as being God's feelings upon the matter, and it's not at all relaxed about the gap between rich and poor. \n \n The stuff in the new testament is just the tip of the ice-berg about the social question. The topic surfaces habitually in the old testament. Miranda draws attention to the psalms for examples of God siding with the poor against the rich, of condemnation of the wealthy for being wealthy, and of seeking riches and profit-making as being wickedness, theft and idolatry. I'm not very familiar with the psalms, having been put off them by drone-recitation in services, which pretty much guarantees you won't take in the meaning of the actual words. I have studied Proverbs, having broken them down thematically for ahead-of-time useability. There is indeed some sensible business advice (as with other tasks; forethought, prudence and avoiding being over-ambitious). However, the perspective is overwhelmingly condemnatory of getting rich, those who do, and how they do so. The parallelism of the proverbs triangulates the theme of each: the following verse gives more explanation by example of the opposite or a corrolary. On the connected themes of the wicked, the proud, the weak, the poor and those who are oppressed, the book of Proverbs actually seethes with what used to be called proletarian class-consciousness.\n \n Obviously you've looked at Acts 2 and 4 and Ananias and Saphira. If you go into Steven's trial testimony (assuming it to be faithful reporting - clearly the disciples were familiar with his favourite riffs) and look at who arrested him, the particular prophets he quoted from and which of Jesus' messages that relates to, and then ask yourself \"in what way would the Temple not have been observing the law if that is what Steven says Jesus came to correct, and that's what they arrested him for trying to meddle with\", you find yourself pointed directly towards Deuteronomy 15 and Leviticus 25. Also considering what Steven was complaining about to the apostles so that they invented deacons and made him one. Once you get to Leviticus 25 all sorts of light-bulbs should be lighting up for you. Once you get the place of Leviticus 25 in the prophecy of Isaiah, Amos and Micah connected then the sermon on the mount, the parables and all kinds of incidents in Jesus walk suddenly become clear as daylight. It completely explains where the apostles came by the idea of common property in the therapeutic and mutually nurturing community of the kingdom of God. Where Judah and God had waited in vain for another 'good king' to return the family plots to the little people, Jesus was delivering the parts of the Law of Moses the Temple never had spontaneously and from the smallest of beginnings without waiting for any official approval or protection. So you have the church sharing everything equally and selling everything you have and adding it to the pool as the price of admission (being born again - coming into the kingdom as you came into the world: with nothing), and it being harder for a rich man to enter than for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle/very narrow gateway - possible only once smaller by the value of his holdings. Why communism instead of a land reform? Firstly, communism is the transitional stage on the way to the great land reform pending once all the unrestituted (unredeemed) wealth is in hand. Secondly, because it takes as long as it takes starting from nowhere by spontaneous conversion of individuals. Thirdly, because it all fits together morally, in terms of the beauty of the disproprotionate generosity of communism as in the parable of the harvest-time labourers being paid the same regardless how much of the day they'd worked. It is in keeping with the unreasonable generosity of God towards his children, that it should not worry about recouping of outlay. \n \n It is also to do with the renunciation of the idolatry of Mammon, which is \"Capital\" or \"Finance\" rather than money in the sense of cash, to not make decisions about people on the basis of either conserving or trying to increase amounts of money. As we now recognise, generosity towards people pays for itself hansomely in the wider picture, rather than on the simple single balance sheet, in terms of reduced transaction costs, consumer confidence, economies of scale and concentration, and spin-off benefits of all kinds. Idolatry of Mammon instead worships capital (gives worth-ship) not only to an imaginary (notional), artificial thing of human making, but does so by making human beings serve it, rather than the reverse, treating human lives as components, or ingredients to be used up or disposed of to worship it (add value to it). As Miranda points out, Mammon is the only false god and rival of the true God for control of the world Jesus actually names: a man may not have two masters; he cannot serve both God and Mammon. If you are worshipping Mammon, then you are not serving God no matter what you may believe doctrinally. What is \"the worship that God wants\" according to the prophet? (All other attempts at worship are unwanted). The service of God requires the quitting of the service of Capital, whether it is your own fragment of Mammon as a rich individual, or Capital as in belief in Capital as the great good, such as \"the hidden hand of the market\" or \"free trade\", or the worshipping of Capital by serving in the businesses built around Capital using people to add money to capital, rather than people using money to add to people. Inter alia, note how as Financialisation has grown, faith has declined. This is not coincidental. Observe how advertizing manipulates and alters people's values about everything, stigmatising that which is not for sale, and driving out other messages by sheer quantity of air-time. \n \n Its hard to see it happening, isn't it? Even with the whole world economy teetering over an abyss of exponentially increasing debt racked up by speculators while climate change supply shocks and infrastructure destruction shocks are already in train. \n \n Still, the rightists being unbiblical as elsewhere, there is no rapture, the earth is redeemed, the church wins and the righteous, downtrodden and broken are all equally resurrected to share in the fulfillment of the kingdom for ever. The meek inherit the earth (property and control) and the poor have the kingdom itself (their share in the common good) as their possession (\"for theirs is...\"). Which constitutes for a poor man a treasure found in a field which enables him on buying that little plot to live comfortably and well ever after.",

   "Over 8 million people in the US alone benefit from christain charity annually . That's communism?\n\n \n Yes and No. If you mean that Christian charity in the US is somehow demeaned by bringing up the communistic life of the early church and the communistic teachings of the Bible about matters socio-economic then no it is not demeaning since we are not talking about the Soviet model or the redneck simplistic negative stereotype about socialists and (party- political) communists. On the other hand, yes the new testament teachings about charity are in the context of a project of building a new society within the early church in which private property is abolished to eradicate poverty. \n \n The majority of contemporary Christian charity has no such effect or intention, and so is neither communism nor Biblical. The Biblical model addresses the origins of relative economic inequality in the redistribution of income away from employees and consumers and toward wealth owners through profit-taking. \n \n The point of everything Jesus says about giving in the sermon on the mount and elsewhere is not merely to spend your accumulated wealth on the poor, and so impoverish yourself before everyone runs out of resources being used up, but to create a new economy of shared ownership so that no-one has to go short ever again. It is not giving away, for the prophets and the Mosaic law, but giving back, so that the poor can once again fend for themselves, and with their own fair share of wealth ownership no longer to be poor at all. But Jesus is explicit: this does involve also doing away with rich people being rich.",

For from time to time those who owned land or houses sold them, brought the money from the sales 35 and put it at the apostles' feet, and it was distributed to anyone who had need. \n 36 Joseph, a Levite from Cyprus, whom the apostles called Barnabas (which means \"son of encouragement\"), 37 sold a field he owned and brought the money and put it at the apostles' feet. \n \n Acts 5\n Ananias and Sapphira\n 1 Now a man named Ananias, together with his wife Sapphira, also sold a piece of property. 2 With his wife's full knowledge he kept back part of the money for himself, but brought the rest and put it at the apostles' feet. \n 3 Then Peter said, \"Ananias, how is it that Satan has so filled your heart that you have lied to the Holy Spirit and have kept for yourself some of the money you received for the land? 4 Didn't it belong to you before it was sold? And after it was sold, wasn't the money at your disposal? What made you think of doing such a thing? You have not lied just to human beings but to God.\" \n \n 5 When Ananias heard this, he fell down and died. And great fear seized all who heard what had happened. 6 Then some young men came forward, wrapped up his body, and carried him out and buried him. \n \n 7 About three hours later his wife came in, not knowing what had happened. 8 Peter asked her, \"Tell me, is this the price you and Ananias got for the land?\" \n \n \"Yes,\" she said, \"that is the price.\" \n \n 9 Peter said to her, \"How could you conspire to test the Spirit of the Lord? Listen! The feet of the men who buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out also.\" \n \n 10 At that moment she fell down at his feet and died. Then the young men came in and, finding her dead, carried her out and buried her beside her husband. 11 Great fear seized the whole church and all who heard about these events. \n \n \n Not exactly textbook communism, but you have to admit it sure is not capitalism and if that isn't intimidation I don't know what is.",

   "The people who attend church do, whether it's sales taxes, the IRS, state taxes, etc.\n \n On a related issued (the budget deal), disgraced democrat Charles Rangel asked. \"What would Jesus do?\" \n \n Why don't these democrats ask that question when it comes to abortion, or gay sex, etc.? \n \n But to answer his question, I seriously doubt Jesus would approve of loading on the backs of future generations trillions and trillions of dollars in new debt to eat away at their income.\n \n And nowhere in scripture does Jesus insist that giving has to first go through a corrupt, bloated, and inefficient government bureaucracy before being handed out to the needy.\n \n Finally, once again, Rangel and his liberal minded brethren would have tons more money for their social programs if they hadn't butchered 50 million Americans in their mother's wombs. Dummies.\n\n \n Seriously, you are the problem with Government today. You don't have a clue as to what the problems are and all your solutions are not based on anything credible. You blindly support the political party that you think will come closest to making things consistent with your perspective, even though over the last two decades they have consistently done the opposite. \n \n Here is a question since The Republicans were given their \"mandate\" from the American people to create jobs and fix the economy what laws have been passed to accomplish this? And saying the Democrats have blocked them is untrue and doesn't matter. They said they would do something and they have named more Post Offices than helped the economy or created jobs. The rest of the time has been spent on how can they make things bad so Obama will not get reelected. While offering Larry, Moe, Curly and Laverne and Shirley as a solution.\n \n If Jesus wanted things to be a certain way he would not have left. Did you ever consider that? \n \n Obviously the plan included letting us figure things out for ourselves. \n \n If abortion is such a sin in the eyes of God why does he allow it? If being gay is an abomination then why does he make people that way?",

   "You will not find anywhere in the Bible where Jesus and his gang of disciples beat up capitalists, rob them and redistribute the wealth according to the Party's central plan. You will not find Jesus praising the nobility of the Roman State and lauding its achievements in suppressing trade. When asked if he denies the legitimacy of taxation, he answers with a riddle.\n \n There is nothing in Christanity that suggests Jesus was in favour of communism as meaning - a coercive apparatus that enforces equalitarian distribution by theft, brutality, murder and imprisonment of those who would dare retain their own property.\n \n There is plenty to suggest he favoured a non-materialistic lifestyle of sharing and giving and did not look favourably towards those who were overly fixated on wealth.\n \n My problem with so most so-called \"Communist interpretation of Christianity\" is that it seeks to entirely glaze over this distinction with some vague labels and simply use Christianity as a way to justify violent state coercion.\n\n \n Interesting. Way to get off topic. This thread is about the communist nature of Jesus' conception of the kingdom of God found in the gospels, not about the Soviet model or the anti-communist negative stereotype of socialists and socialism. \n \n As you probably know, of course there is somewhere in the Bible where Jesus does 'beat up capitalists' - John 2: 13-16. Notice in particular verse 15 \"He made a whip of cords and drove them out of the temple, sheep, cattle and all\" and verse 16 in which John has Jesus saying \"'do not turn my Father's house into a market.'\" \n \n Funny how you don't hear so much about this passage, huh? This is coming from Saint John, the gospellist who is heaviest in terms of other-worldly theology and lightest on the social teachings and the kingdom of God on earth. People making money tend to object to having their businesses thrown out of premises, or interrupted in any way whatsoever, for that matter. It is inconceivable that Jesus could have used the whip only on the animals while facing blows from the merchants. I rather suspect there were raised voices. The disciples with him would have to have got stuck in likewise. We have always heard that he got angry, but how much, at whom, and why? John says enough to form a fist and wield a whip with it. John says that it was anger with money-makers and that it was about the operation of a market, (and specifically a money-market - topical hey). However you spin the issue as being about the location rather than being a market as such, evidently for Jesus there is something unholy and unrighteous about a market and money-making, such that it should happen nowhere near the temple (if at all). \n \n According to the prophets, the problem is the making of profits in the first place, as creating inequality and poverty, and thereby constituting wickedness. \n \n So is the use of violence to achieve redistribution justifiable? Well, that's the big question isn't it? I do not recommend it. On balance it seems to me Jesus' programme of action to achieve wholesale redistribution of wealth is built around non-violence. Not only is it futile to take on the whole apparatus of violent power with its own weapons, but doing so is just replicating the evils of states, armies and oppression. On the other hand, Jesus specifies a boundary to salvation: you can't keep the stuff if you have much more than the poor, and if you got it by making profits. That isn't violence or coercion, but it is pretty blunt: \"Go, sell everything you have, and give it [back] to the poor.\" No sugar coating; no \"what I really mean is..\", no \"just try hard to be a good person..\" or \"when you're ready you might like to consider...\". And, no, that isn't how they tell it in the average Evangelical church, which is where they are not as Biblical as they claim they are. \n \n For really scary take a careful look at the tale of poor Lazarus with Abraham versus the rich man in hades (Luke 16: 19-31). For those who believe in afterlife paradise and hell (as opposed to rest in the grave folowed by the resurrection of the righteous and eternal life in the triumphant kingdom of God on earth, per the Lord's prayer and the Nicene Creed), what Jesus says gets one man sent to hades and the other to heaven should shake your confidence in God's supposed indulgent ignoring of well-off lifestyles. Equally, nothing is said about Lazarus' moral character - you are free to presume he was a drunk and womanizer, even, or about how the rich man treated his wife and kids (who he didn't abort). All that affects their judgement is how they enjoyed their lives because of their relative incomes. We know that God is love, and grace is available to any willing to hear and repent, but you need to recognise that is you are well-off, if you are a money-maker and if you believe in such other gods as \"the hidden hand of the market\" God doesn't like you, and you make Jesus angry. The God of the Bible does have a view about the class divide: he sides with the poor.\n \n \n As to \"most so called communist interpretation of Christianity\" are you talking about anyone in particular, or assuming a hostile stereotype? As far as I'm aware, there isn't enough Christian communism to rate a \"most so-called\" anything. Then again, there is a large Christian right whose claim to faith is purely formal and contradicted by their lifestyles, business practises and zeal for the slaughtering of criminals and supposed 'enemies of freedom'. Either it's between me and God, or no-one has ever really been a Christian (although there's a good case for that!)",

Money-changing is not just bureau-de-change, but in the context of the national Temple in fact constitutes the national money-market (perhaps the earliest recorded example of such a thing) since there were multiple venders and the opportunity for currency speculation on the transaction rate between the Temple coinage and other currencies. \n \n Once again, not just location at issue.\n \n Your initial view that John 2:14-16 is only about the blurring of the boundary between sacred and profane begs the question \"so why beat up this activity on temple grounds, and not others?\" Necessarily there was a point about Jesus' targetting of the money-changers and sacrificial animal merchants rather than anyone else. You are supposed to understand from the passage that this form of activity in particular attracted his ire. \n \n It is true that pilgrims needed to be able to purchase the animals to fulfill their needs for sacrifial atonement at the Temple. What offended Jesus so much was that on the back of this logical service for pilgrims the Temple hierarchy had created a massive engine of profiteering which impoverished the people of Judaea in addition to the heavy burdens placed on them by Roman taxation and the direct predation of Herod and his family. In fact, this profiteering by the Temple hierarchy predated Herod, going back to the dynastic greed of the Hasmoneans when Judaea was briefly independent, who used the title of Chief Priest as their kingship, since the provincial governorship had been attached to the Chief Priesthood by Persia and then the Greek Seleucids. \n \n Since they were not Kings as such, they used the Temple as their de facto tax-base, and set the temple animal provision and money-changing service up as a means of extracting income from the pilgrims. This meant that the poor were penalised in terms of access to God's forgiveness, and formal conferring of righteous-status. So the poor, especially the sick poor, were being punished for their misfortunes. Inability to pay for the appropriate sacrifices meant being shut out and despised as sinners. Hence Jesus' concern to offer his own direct declaration of forgiveness of sins, as well as the spiritual element of meaning alongside the economic prophecy within \"blessed are the poor\". \n \n Secondly, it destroyed the holiness and mosaic-law purity of the priesthood at large, because it destroyed the divine distribution of income sources within\n the Law. According to Torah, when Canaan was given to the Israelites God distributed the land to the tribes and families so that none were without means of making a living, except for the tribe of the Levites, who were given no land at all. Instead, as the priesthood, they would have as their income the animals sacrificed to God by all Israel, after sacrifice. So everyone was provided for. For the hierarchy then to be selling animals prior to sacrifice, and making money out of taxing pilgrims by making them buy temple-only currency meant that they, and the senior priests in particular, were not only taking more than their share from the rest of the people, but that they were all in tacit breach of the law of Moses for failing to abide within a definition of Levite income found within the books of the Law. In effect, the higher the position: the more compromised, rather than the more holy. \n \n Thirdly, the profit-making at the Temple, being the greatest and most lucrative market in the land (as opposed to at the Mediterranean sea-ports) had the side effect of accelerating concentration of land-ownership into the hands of a few dozen leading families. Certain senior priests became land-magnates not only selling animals to the pilgrims, but also buying the farms where lambs, calves and doves were raised. So not only were they extracting income from pilgrims, but they were helping expropriate them as well, in terms of the tribal ancestral land distribution - creating landlessness, leading to indebtedness and thence slavery. \n \n These are the specifics about the wrongfulness of the market at the Temple in addition to the prophets' general condemnation of profitmaking and interest-charging per se regardless of kind, amount or location.",
