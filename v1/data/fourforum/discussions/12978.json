First of all, Islamic insurgency has always been a tool of the Pakistan military and intelligence services. It has always been controlled, funded and trained by them. Whenever an insurgency organization within Pakistan breaks free of government control, it gets hammered down. Pakistan views Islamic terrorism as a tool against India. When that tool is used against them, things change. The Pakistan military goes after the insurgency. You forget that the Pakistan military is essentially secular and has long had procedures to prevent overly religious people from rising within the power structure. \n \n And while relations between India and Pakistan have been fragile in the past, to call them so fragile now that a single incident could cause a nuclear war is insane. Especially given who is in power right now in both countries.",

Especially given who is in power right now in both countries.\n\n \n To be honest I think the first paragraph is a very convincing argument against the possibility of a Taliban takeover. Even if the Taliban could make large parts of the country virtually ungovernable, if the army remains secular and has the support of the west then I suppose it could stop them from taking over the government.\n The problem is that a country with Nuclear arms would effectively be in a state of civil war and it would be likely that there would be a military take over of government.\n \n \n The second paragraph addresses the present state of affairs between India and Pakistan, not the nightmare scenerio of an Islamic fundamental government of Pakistan.",
