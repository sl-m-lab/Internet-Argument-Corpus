So is the sun a higher power as well? Was the plane that caused a war and the fall of Afghanistan and Iraq a higher power?\n \n Just because something improbable can happen doesn't make it a higher power or mean that there is a higher power. Someone has to win the lottery so is it really all that amazing that someone does? Eventually a straw has to break the camels back so why is it impressive when you find out what straw that is? If you look hard enough and with enough detail you will always be able to pin point an moment that turned the tides of even the most monumental of events so why is it so startling to have one of these pin points marked? I just don't understand your logic. You seem to be overwhelmed by the idea that even the smallest person can make a difference when simple reality is that they can and it can be shown in a logical and rational way without the presents of a higher power.",

Sure a nail caused the fall of the kingdom but there were probably many other things involved in it as well, things that if done would have been able to overcome the nail incident. Maybe they made one too few arrows or had their walls one foot too short or had one less man guarding the gates than they should have, either one of which could have turned the tide of the battle and it would have done so in a logical and worldly way. Even the nail incident itself is completely logical and worldly as you described it yourself. So if everything makes complete sense using worldly logic how does it imply that something unworldly needed to be involved in it for it to occur?\n \n Just remember, there is a reason for everything and the reason will make sense when analyzed. If the reason made no sense at all then you may be able to make your point. For instance Jesus rising from the dead and then escaping from his tomb without anyone seeing it happen because all the well trained military guards had fallen asleep at about the same time on their first few hours of guard duty. That in itself would indicate an unworldly event. The nail event is totally worldly and a case of strange but true.",
