   "This isn't hard. I'm just seeing how anti-gun some people are. To be honest, this question is more or less geared towards Brady, but everyone feel free to answer. Questioning the likelyhood of this situation is evading the point, so try not to do that.\n \n A woman, being a CCW holder, is walking through an alley when she sees a man in the corner of her eye jump towards her. She quickly pulls out her firearm and points it at him. He gets scared and runs off.\n \n The first question: did she do anything wrong?\n \n The second question: Would you have supported the choice she made if she didn't have a CCW?\n \n The third question: If he continued his attack and she shot and killed him, would she have done anything wrong? This assumes she holds a CCW.\n \n The fourth question: You could probably predict this one; Would you have stood up for her if she shot the guy and wasn't holding a CCW?\n\n \n I&#8217;ll look at it as if it happened in my state and apply my state&#8217;s law\n \n Question 1. The possible crime is brandishing a firearm (&#8220;point, hold, or brandish a firearm or object similar in appearance in such a manner as to reasonable induce fear in another&#8221;). Self defense would be a defense to this possible crime. Answering this question based upon the limited facts I am given I would say she was reacting to a perceived assault and acted in self-defense. In Virginia it is lawful to threaten the use of deadly force in self-defense.\n \n Question 2. Lacking a CCW permit does not render an otherwise legitimate self-defense action unlawful. Whether she has a CCW permit or not is irrelevant to the question of whether she acted in self-defense. The only issue it raises is whether you charge her with the misdemeanor offense of carrying an illegally concealed weapon. \n \n But for both question #1 and #2 here is the follow up question: How will law enforcement find out about it? If the man&#8217;s intentions were criminal, then he will not go to the magistrate or the police and report &#8220;look, I was going to attack this woman and she pulled a gun on me and made me afraid she was going to shoot me.&#8221; And if she has no permit then she would likely either not report the crime or put away her gun and report it as if she were unarmed. The only way I see it being truthfully reported is if the man believed he was doing nothing wrong and the woman mistook what he was doing and panicked.\n \n Question 3. Really two questions&#8212;Moral and Legal. The moral question is hers alone to deal with. The legal answer hinges on this question: Do you believe, as the circumstances appeared to her, that she reasonably believed she was in danger of suffering death or great bodily harm? To answer this I would have a lot of follow-up fact questions&#8230;.What was the size of the man? Whether he displayed any weapon? What was the lighting? Etc. \n \n And yes, I would ask Sinjin&#8217;s question of why she was there and whether she knew the man. It is a free country, and she is free to go down this public alley. But the bottom line is when a man is killed you want to feel confident that you know as much as can be known about who what when where how and why before you decide whether or not to prosecute someone. For example, we would want to know whether any clue exists for the man&#8217;s motives--did he know her, and if so, then did he have a motive to specifically target her (say a disgruntled ex-boyfriend, for example)? And on the flip side, say we discovered later that she told a friend she was having trouble with the ex-boyfriend and decided to lure him into the alley with the false promise of getting back together so she could &#8220;deal with him once and for all.&#8221; You assume from the beginning that her reasons for being in the alley were innocent&#8212;but when a man is killed you turn to an old Cold War phrase: &#8220;Trust, but verify.&#8221; \n \n Question 4. Same answer as question 2. It is irrelevant to whether or not she acted in legitimate self-defense. Again, the only issue is whether you charge her with carrying an illegally concealed weapon&#8212;a question you have to answer whether or not you feel her shooting was justified by self-defense.\n \n Finally, for the killing scenario let&#8217;s assume for a moment you ultimately decide she was not justified in using deadly force. The next question involves anticipating possible jury nullification and whether you think you could convince either a judge or a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that she did not act in self-defense but instead committed a crime&#8230;.",

That is what is developing now on this board. Instead of innocent until proven guilty some already are looking for ways to make her prove her innocence. A lot of courts and PDs are still doing that and only the more up to date and honest courts are applying the law as written. You can tell them the law all day but if their minds are already made up as it is in Jolly Ol' UK, it makes no difference what the facts nor the law are. I don't recall which of our FF? said, \"if you don't exercise and stand up for your rights, don't be surprised that the law follows your example\". It is as simple as that!\n \n My reasonable compromise was to require anti rights folks to submit themselves to the same limitations they want to diminish the rights of others to exercise their civil right in the Second Amendment. They vociferously refused to follow such draconian principles they would impose on the true law abiding. That says it all right there...they know it is wrong but continue to promote their unConstitutional schemes and demand things of others that are actually exercising their civil rights to self defense. Of course if they did it they would expect different treatment. Nice try but hitting fungos will not a ball player make. You either got it or you don't. It is kind of like singing to a pig, it just irritates the pig and you waste your time. Double standards are the true mark of a liberal emoticon_angry",

   "Long time since I've been on this forum. Can't remember why I left... oh yeah. Life. emoticon_frazzled\n \nSnip-o!\n\n Question 1: Depends on the state she lives in. Ba-dum-tish! Seriously though. In Florida, if she felt as though someone was going to do her great bodily harm, or that her life was threatened - no. Also, if she was preventing a forcible felony, she's good to go. She better DAMN sure call the police RIGHT after the incident and report it though. Last time I checked, in public, I can walk anywhere I want, and whenever I want. I can \"freakin' go exploring!\" (Cue Oreo the Explorer theme music.):xbanghead Also, my co-workers need to know that I carry concealed about as much as they need to know the color of my poop. Is my \"good citizen\" status being called into question because I want to be able to defend myself? emoticon_mad Poppycock! \n \n Question 2: Self-defense is a universal right. Yes - but, despite my disagreeing with it, she'd STILL be guilty of carrying without a permit - if her state required one.\n \n Question 3: Righteous shoot in the purest of forms. Remember, we as citizens protecting ourselves don't shoot to kill or harm, we shoot to STOP THE THREAT. If I'm in a deadly force situation and I pop my attacker twice in the center of mass and he drops and stays there, I will NOT empty the rest of the clip into his skull. I will keep my firearm trained on him while maintaining good situational awareness until the police arrive.\n \n Question 4:See question 2. If you're justified in using lethal force, you're justified - permit or not. Self-defense, universal, blah blah. She'll still be guilty of carrying without a permit though. Shame on her for not getting the permit - in Florida training courses can be found for $40 - that includes all the paperwork and passport photos for your ID. Go to the regional office of the Dept. of Agriculture, submit the papers and pay the fee there, wait two to four weeks and voila. If you can afford the gun, you can afford the license - $75.

   "This isn't hard. I'm just seeing how anti-gun some people are. To be honest, this question is more or less geared towards Brady, but everyone feel free to answer. Questioning the likelyhood of this situation is evading the point, so try not to do that.\n \n A woman, being a CCW holder, is walking through an alley when she sees a man in the corner of her eye jump towards her. She quickly pulls out her firearm and points it at him. He gets scared and runs off.\n \n The first question: did she do anything wrong?\n \n The second question: Would you have supported the choice she made if she didn't have a CCW?\n \n The third question: If he continued his attack and she shot and killed him, would she have done anything wrong? This assumes she holds a CCW.\n \n The fourth question: You could probably predict this one; Would you have stood up for her if she shot the guy and wasn't holding a CCW?\n\n \n She did the right thing and yes I would stand up for her.",

   "You know I'm not saying that. \n Is there no alley you'd avoid given the chance? \n Was she looking for trouble?\n Police would certainly want to know what she was doing there.\n\n \n Sinjin I see where your going with it,but what if it were another alley or another\n and it go's on,or you can second guess yourself and still pick the wrong alley, in which case the police would still want to know what she was doing there.\n :(\n However you got #2&3 right.emoticon_xgood",
