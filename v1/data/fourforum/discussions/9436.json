   "Well this post is an extention of my conversation about skulls with Peeling. I think this is important enough to start a new thread.\n \n We all know how our evolutionist friends like to make assumptions based on the contour of one's skull. They have historically called Neanderthals and homo erectus brutes and and \"sub-human\" simply because of their skull shape. Peeling showed me a line-up of skulls from Talk Origins. Here it is for reference: (by the way, this is not a lineage, proven by the fact that they start out with chimps -- we did not evolve from chimps.) These are just different skulls lined up in a pretty line next to each other:\n \n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/hominids.html\n \n But let's look at 9-13 year-old Turnkana boy -- one of the most famous homo erectus fossils, which is supposed to be one of the oldest humans fossils.\n \n http://www.bigfootblog.com/Pictures/TurkanaBoy.jpg\n \n Upon just a quick glance you can tell this person is simply a human being. Evolutionists only look at the shape of his head and then make determinations based on that. What determinations? Well not only do they determine that this person was non-intellectual...but the important thing -- they say he is OLD...maybe up to 2 million years old -- and based on what???? -- well, of course, the shape of his skull.\n \n And it doesn't matter that his remains were found sticking out of the ground along the banks of a dry riverbed....according to evolutionists they can just stick bones anywhere they want along the articifically-created timeline. (I thought bones were dated by depth or strata?)\n \n So this Turkana boy is dated at least 1.5 million years old based on skull morphology. Intestingly look what Richard Leakey says about homo erectus:\n \n One would also see differences: in the shape of the skull, in the degree of protrusion of the face, the robustness of the brows and so on. These differences are probably no more pronounced than we see today between the separate geographical races of modern humans. Such biological variation arises when populations are geographically separated from each other for significant lengths of time.\n \n So let's move on to the next skull -- which is of a \"modern\" human: \n \n http://www.canovan.com/HumanOrigin/kow/03.jpg\n \n As you can read by the caption below this skull is dated at 12,000 years old.). It seems the oldest radiocarbon dates obtained from the Kow swamp people were dated at 13,000 years, while the youngest were dated at approximately 6500 years. This person lived in Australia, has a skull that's at least as \"robust\" as Turkana boy or any of the homo erectus or other skulls on that Talk Origins page...yet dating carbon dating shows they are quite young. This makes evolutinists very nervous, epecially considering many people say that the morphologies of kow swamp and homo erectus are quite similar. But the robust morphology of homo erectus was supposed to be replaced by more \"modern\" humans.\n \n Could it not just be that skull shape is just variation of a theme brought about by local living conditions???? Could it not be that skull shape has nothing to do with when a person lived?? Surely evolutionists don't have the nerve to call these 6,000 year-old kow swamp people \"sub-human.\"...surely they're not calling Kow Swamp people \"transitionals!\" And could it not be that Kow Swamp was a quasi-variation of homo erectus? \n \n Not according to evolutionists...watch how they operate:\n \n http://archaeology.about.com/library...erms=kow+swamp\n \n Definition: Archaeological site in northern Victoria, Australia, excavated by Alan Thorne in the late 1960s and 1970s, consisting of the burials of forty individuals. The earliest burials at Kow Swamp are dated between 13,000 and 9,500 years ago. Thorne initially believed the robust skulls belonged to Homo erectus--but the dates are far too late for that and the skulls do not match modern understandings of H. erectus characteristics. Researchers today believe that the Kow Swamp skeletons are evidence of changes in human skeletal morphology in the last 10,000 years. \n \n So in otherwords, along with the fact that the skull is not exactly like homo erectus, the real issue is the DATES are too late for this to be homo erectus....because home erectus, of course, lived 1.5 - 2 millions years ago! See how their ciruclar reasoning works? (I actually think this skull looks a bit like the supposed 2+ million year-old homo habils skull)\n \n So this is what it boils down to. Look at what DarwinRefuted.com says:\n \n http://www.darwinismrefuted.com/origin_of_man_05.html\n \n It is now a more pronounced fact in the scientific community that Homo erectus is a superfluous taxon, and that fossils assigned to the Homo erectus class are actually not so different from Homo sapiens as to be considered a different species. In American Scientist, the discussions over this issue and the result of a conference held on the subject in 2000 were summarized in this way: \n \n Most of the participants at the Senckenberg conference got drawn into a flaming debate over the taxonomic status of Homo erectus started by Milford Wolpoff of the University of Michigan, Alan Thorne of the University of Canberra and their colleagues. They argued forcefully that Homo erectus had no validity as a species and should be eliminated altogether. All members of the genus Homo, from about 2 million years ago to the present, were one highly variable, widely spread species, Homo sapiens , with no natural breaks or subdivisions. The subject of the conference, Homo erectus , didn't exist.201\n \n The conclusion reached by the scientists defending the abovementioned thesis can be summarized as \"Homo erectus is not a different species from Homo sapiens , but rather a race within Homo sapiens .\" On the other hand, there is a huge gap between Homo erectus , a human race, and the apes that preceded Homo erectus in the \"human evolution\" scenario (Australopithecus , Homo Habilis , and Homo rudolfensis ). This means that the first men appeared in the fossil record suddenly and without any prior evolutionary history. \n \n So, if homo erectus is just variation of a kind...and kow swamp is just variation of a kind...and Neanderthals are just variation of a kind...and Mexicans and Chinese and Russians and Australians are just variation of a kind........from what did we evolve from? If homo erectus and all those other homo skulls at hominids2.jpg are just a variation of homo sapien......then the concept of human \"evolution\" is falsified and the gap between humans and apes is indeed as wide as the Atlantic Ocean....and there is nothing linking them. Not only that but there is absolutely NO justification in saying that homo erectus is 1.5 - 2 million years old. None.\n \n And not only that....what you have to remember is these skulls are extremely old. Evolutionists claim them to be hundreds of thousands of years old. Of course they are not that old, but they are old...and fragile...and weathered...and pieced together....and include parts that are not original parts. Not only that, but most of these skulls don't even have a lower mandible, which makes them look even more freakish.....if we had whole skulls and a whole skeletons to go with them, it would be pretty obvious which are apes and which are humans.....and there would be nothing in between.\n \n Finally...and I can't get into this now...but in a later thread I'll show how there are perfectly good non-evolutionary explanations as to why older homo sapiens had different shaped skulls than we do now. Skull shape has nothing at all to do with darwinian selection or random mutations and it has everything to do with diet and lifestyle. This is a huge subject so it will have to wait. \n \n By the way -- where are the carbon dating results for homo erectus? I'd like to see those.",

(I thought bones were dated by depth or strata?)\nIs your ignorance intentional? You've never heard of erosion?\n \nSo this Turkana boy is dated at least 1.5 million years old based on skull morphology.\nNope. It is dated to about 1.6 mya based on the date of the stratum in which it was found. The actual dating was done by radiometric dating of various rock samples (volcanic) from above and below the fossils, and by stratigraphic studies. The shape of the skull was not a factor in the dating.\n \nIntestingly look what Richard Leakey says about homo erectus:\n \n One would also see differences: in the shape of the skull, in the degree of protrusion of the face, the robustness of the brows and so on. These differences are probably no more pronounced than we see today between the separate geographical races of modern humans. Such biological variation arises when populations are geographically separated from each other for significant lengths of time.\nSloppy. May be you are lying and Richard Leakey never said that. You don't support your quote with a source, so it must be a lie. Actually you got that quote from the site of the fundamentalist Muslim creationist, Harun Yahya. You never read Leakey's book, did you? Thus, you can't actually claim that it is not grossly out of context (which it is). How do you know that Leakey is not talking about the range of variation in different H. erectus skulls from various locations (like Africa and Java and China) and comparing that variation to the range of variation in modern humans? How do you know that Leakey is not claiming that H. erectus skulls are not within the range of normal human variation (since they are not)? By the way, the original source of the quote is Richard Leakey, 1981, The Making of Mankind, Sphere Books, London, p. 116. Of course, a quote from a 25 year old book needs a lot of support since things have been moving so fast since then.\n \n As for the actual fossil that you claim is just \"simply a human being.\" Let's start at the top. The vault of the KNM-WT 15000 (Turkana Boy or Nariokotome Boy) is much lower and smoothly curved, unlike modern humans (even those that you and Harun Yahya point to). This, of course, reflects the smaller brain size of KNM-WT 15000, about 880 cc. At adulthood that would have been about 910 cc, larger than australopiths but smaller than the 1350 cc average for modern humans. The forehead is low and sloping with a strong brow ridge, less pronounced than earlier specimens (and even Neandertal, for that matter) but more pronounced than in modern humans. Of course, in adulthood, the brow ridge would have been even more pronounced. The face is narrow and long with the with the lower face and the jaw protruding forward. The teeth are quite human like except that they show developmental range that is not typical of modern humans. The chin is receding, actually absent. The post cranial skeleton is of modern size although there are marked differences from modern humans (as anyone with a lick of knowledge can tell). The vertebrae have longer spines than is typical. The spinal canal is more restricted, which would limit the room for a spinal cord large enough to control the complex breathing necessary for speech. The rib cage is quite narrow at the top and broad at the bottom, similar to the physiology of the australopiths. Modern humans have a rib cage that is quite broad at the top and less conical. The arms are longer relative to modern humans. The pelvis is quite narrow. The extreme narrowness of Turkana Boy's seems to indicate a male since the birth canal would be much too narrow even the smaller head of this species. Other fossils of similar age and morphology found in the same area indicate the broader pelvis of a female. The neck on the femur is elongated when compared to modern humans. This would make KNM-WT 15000 quite a fast runner.\n \n If you would actually like to learn what you are talking about, I recommend The Wisdom of the Bones (1996) by Alan Walker and Pat Shipman, Random House, New York. ISNB 0679747834\n \nSo let's move on to the next skull -- which is of a \"modern\" human: \n \n http://www.canovan.com/HumanOrigin/kow/03.jpg\n \n As you can read by the caption below this skull is dated at 12,000 years old.).

This makes evolutinists very nervous, epecially considering many people say that the morphologies of kow swamp and homo erectus are quite similar. But the robust morphology of homo erectus was supposed to be replaced by more \"modern\" humans.\nDefine \"robust\". I think you misunderstand the words you are using. The picture isn't very good and the skull seems to be a bit misshapen. However, it seems to have a chin, the lower face is not protruding, there is no brow ridge, the forehead is higher and slopes less than I would expect from a H. erectus, and the vault of the skull is certainly much higher.\n \nCould it not just be that skull shape is just variation of a theme brought about by local living conditions????\nSure. That would certainly account for any differences from modern humans - Oh, wait. This is a modern human.\n \nCould it not be that skull shape has nothing to do with when a person lived?? Surely evolutionists don't have the nerve to call these 6,000 year-old kow swamp people \"sub-human.\" And could it not be that Kow Swamp was a quasi-variation of homo erectus?\nActually, the only people who I hear talk about \"sub-human\" are creationists. There is the possibility that certain Australian fossils may have descended from H. erectus fossils from Indonesia. And why would a fossil make an \"evolutionist\" nervous? The idea is really, really dumb.\n \nNot according to evolutionists...watch how they operate:\n \n So in otherwords, along with the fact that the skull is not exactly like homo erectus,\nOnly a creationist would see that as dishonest. It isn't like a H. erectus so evolutionists must be using circular reasoning. At least you have given us an example of how fundamentalist Muslim creationists operate.\n \n snip of more ad hoc reasoning from fundamentalist Muslim creationists\n \nSkull shape has nothing at all to do with darwinian selection or random mutations and it has everything to do with diet and lifestyle.\nAnd I guess it doesn't have anything to do with brain size either.\n \nBy the way -- where are the carbon dating results for homo erectus? I'd like to see those.\nHow ignorant does anyone have to be to not be aware that carbon dating is not appropriate for dating H. erectus? It is wrong for two reasons; the fossils are too old and they are rock. You can't date rocks with carbon dating.",

The Middle Pleistocene is where the modern human postcrania develops, the modern cranial features begin to develop, and significant increases in brain size occur. It is also important because many behavioral changes occur in this time period, e.g., much more developed lithic industries, the controlled use of fire, regular meat-eating, hunting, etc. This is where the things most people consider \"human\" start to develop to the point where most people would recognize these pattern of anatomy and behavior as human. This is also a dynamic time in the evolutionary perspective caused by these species, with the recent well-dated Dmanisi remains in the Republic of Georgia, dated to 1.7 myr. \n \n http://www.archaeologyinfo.com/homoerectus.htm",

   "Since you pretend to be speaking from a position of authority, one hopes that you have actually done some research, otherwise you are being dishonest.\nI know what I'm talking about.\nActually, it is quite apparent that you do not. For one glaring example, below you incorrectly state that a dinosaur fossil has been dated by C-14. Another example of you lack of understanding of the topic is your failure to understand why very old fossils are found on the surface and the principles of dating from geologic strata.\n \nActually, if you know what you are talking about even a quick glance will tell you that you are wrong. Of course, paleoanthropologists who study such fossils do more than take a quick glance at it.\nI gave you the name and a thumbnail...if you aren't bright enough to go look at a bigger picture than I can't help you.\nActually, you gave (and misspelled) one of the common names given to the fossil, \"Turkana Boy\" It is also sometimes called \"Nariokotome Boy\". But the real designation of the fossil is KNM-WT 15000 and any knowledgeable discussion of that fossil will refer to it as such. That fact, by the way, is how I know that Turkana Boy and Nariokotome Boy are one and the same fossil.\n \nAbsolute balderdash. While much can be determined from the head, \"evolutionists\" actually look at all of the fossil material available.\nIf you died today near a big rock would it be fair to date you at what that rock is dated at? Of course not. And by the way...parts of turkana boy were found on top of the ground.\nYou seem to have had a bit of a cognitive disconnect there. You quoted something I said and then gave a completely non-responsive answer. You seem to be thrashing a bit in order not to make yourself look foolish. It's too late. I guess you have no response after your silly assertion that paleoanthropologists date skulls by the shape has been corrected. And your little story about dying next to a big rock only reveals your ignorance even more. Fossils are dated by dating strata, not individual rocks. I'll give you a couple of simple examples in hopes that you are able to understand. Where I grew up there is a horizontal line in many hillsides. It is visible where runoff has created valleys. In fact, that same stratum has been identified on every continent. It is easily dated and dates the same wherever it is found. Below that line there are multiple fossils weathering out of the hillsides, while above it there are none for a considerable distance. That line marks the K-T boundary. It is 65 million years old and no dinosaur fossil has ever been found above that line, or in strata younger than 65 million years. That is why your claim that dinosaurs have been dated with carbon 14 is so ignorant. It would be a stupid thing to do since since fossils of that age no longer contain carbon and it is much too old to date by carbon 14.\n \n Another simple example can be found at Laetoli in Tanzania. The site is not far from the Olduvai Gorge. Just below the surface there is a layer of volcanic ash, known as a tuff. It is one of many in the area that are used to date fossils. Volcanic ash is an ideal stratum for radiometric dating (but not carbon 14 dating). The volcanic ash at Laetoli has been dated to 3.7 million years, and the tuff above it to less than 3.7 million, and the one below it to more than 3.7 million. Thus, fossils found below that layer are older than 3.7 million years, and fossils found above it are younger than 3.7 million years. Do you understand why that is true, SS? It's a simple geologic concept; deeper layers are older than the layers on top of them.\n \n Anyway, in that volcanic tuff lots and lots of footprints of various animals have been found. Thus, we know that those footprints are 3.7 years old. Such examples are called trace fossils. Trace fossils are common in strata around the world. For example, there are lizard tracks fossilized in the coconino sandstone in the wall of the Grand Canyon.\n \nIs your ignorance intentional? You've never heard of erosion?\n\nIt was nice of you to quote me with an appropriate remark to your above discussion.\n \n So this Turkana boy is dated at least 1.5 million years old based on skull morphology. \n \n \nNope. It is dated to about 1.6 mya based on the date of the stratum in which it was found. The actual dating was done by radiometric dating of various rock samples (volcanic) from above and below the fossils, and by stratigraphic studies. The shape of the skull was not a factor in the dating.\nthen why the heck did talk origins line those stupid skulls up by the way they LOOK???? ARe you seriously telling me that they lined them up by what strata they found them in? Surely you're not that dumb. Many of the fossils scientists find are partially exposed -- just like turkana boy was -- otherwise they'd never find them.\nPeeling has already done a nice job of pointing out your foolishness here. But, yes, the skulls are lined up according to the dates of the strata in which they were found. Talk origins lined them up that way because they show the historical progression of fossils that illustrates the transition from very ape-like, to more and more human-like.\n \nSloppy. May be you are lying and Richard Leakey never said that.\nBrother...you are sick. Why would I lie about homo erectus being a human being?\nThe remark was made about you lying about Richard Leakey making that statement. You don't actually know that he ever said such a thing. You are allowing yourself to be duped by your fundamentalist Muslim master. You never read that book and actually have no idea of what Leakey was saying. Using out of context quotes, especially when you rob them from other fundamentalist Muslim creationists, isn't honest.\n \nThink about the name: \"Homo Erectus\"...it means upright human...which implies that it's the first one....he was also the first to use tools and migrate all over the freaking world.\nI am perfectly aware of what Homo erectus means. However, you again reveal you ignorance. The name doesn't imply that H. erectus was the \"first one\" (whatever that means). Nor was he the first to use tools. There are older examples of H. habilis, H. rudolfensis, and H. ergaster. \n \nThere are no upright apes. Get your dang facts right. homo erectus is a human being.\nAnother cognitive disconnect? Since no body mentioned apes your comment appears quite bizarre. Moreover, H. erectus isn't a \"human being\" because human beings are called Homo sapiens. Besides, scientifically and taxonomically, \"human being\" is mostly meaningless. According to recent taxonomy H. erectus is a hominan, as is Homo sapiens.\n \nhttp://www.answersingenesis.org/tj/v14/i1/cranial.asp\nMore of the cognitive disconnect. What on earth does cranial-vault thickness have to do with it? I see you also allow yourself to be duped by fundamentalist christians. You should be aware that Answers in Genesis isn't accurate when it comes to science. They tend to follow dogma and ignore evidence. Besides, John Woodmorappe (Jan Peczkis) works both sides of the aisle.\n \nHow do you know that Leakey is not claiming that H. erectus skulls are not within the range of normal human variation (since they are not)?\nWho said there is a \"range?\"\nLeakey did. Didn't you read your own quote? What do you think he means by \"biological variation?\"\n \nThe reality is erectus skulls are smaller because the people were SMALL -- like 5.0 - 5'5 tall, XXXXX.\nSo you know how foolish you are and hope that name calling will distract from that being recognized by everyone. Erectus skulls were smaller because the brain was smaller. You brought up KNM-WT 15000 (Turkana Boy) and you weren't even aware that as an adult he would have been about 6'1\" tall? Why is his skull smaller than modern humans?\n \nThe other thing is homo erectus skulls are almost identical to Neanderthal skulls -- just smaller.\nNo they're not. You are making yourself look foolish again.\n \nThey've often been referred to as \"little Neanderthals\".\nBy whom? I don't think it's been often.\n \nAs for the actual fossil that you claim is just \"simply a human being.\" Let's start at the top. The vault of the KNM-WT 15000 (Turkana Boy or Nariokotome Boy) is much lower and smoothly curved, unlike modern humans (even those that you and Harun Yahya point to).\n\n There are non-evolutionary explanations for skull morphologies. You just don't know it yet.[/quote]But this individual does not appear to be pathological. Of course, I continued and explained to you the reason why the skull is shaped differently.\n \nThis, of course, reflects the smaller brain size of KNM-WT 15000, about 880 cc. At adulthood that would have been about 910 cc, larger than australopiths but smaller than the 1350 cc average for modern humans.\nHow about that? Smaller brain, smaller skull.\n \n I'm going to skip the rest of the quote where I explained to you the differences between KNM-WT 1500 and modern human skeletons. It seems that you didn't understand what was said, so it wouldn't do any good to repeat it.\n \nIf you look at that skeleton, it is obviously human. The skull has reasons for looking like it does. I'll have to get to that later.\nThat's the part that you didn't understand. I tried to use simple language, but apparently it was still beyond your ability. The skeleton is certainly human-like, but if you actually knew what you were talking about, you would be aware of the differences that show that it is not modern human.\n \nHow ignorant does anyone have to be to not be aware that carbon dating is not appropriate for dating H. erectus? It is wrong for two reasons; the fossils are too old and they are rock. You can't date rocks with carbon dating.\nHow do you KNOW the bones are old? Just because someone says they are?\nI see that you missed to point. I was correcting you lack of knowledge about carbon 14 dating. You think that you can date fossils of this age with carbon. You also seem to think that you can date rocks with carbon 14. You can't. Time after time you reveal your ignorance by your inability to respond appropriately. KNM-WT 15000 was dated from stratigraphic studies of the area and dating of specific, appropriate rock samples from above and below the fossils.\n \nARe you really that stupid to not understand?\nSo you actually have no answer but insult? It would be nice if you could respond with some intelligence just once.\n \nJust because they are presumed old does not make them be.\nRight. That's why the rocks around the sample were dated.\n \nJust because it would destroy ToE if they are young is no reason not to date them.\nAh! A double dose of ignorance. If the fossils were young it wouldn't destroy the ToE. Do you actually understand so little? And, of course, the fossils were dated. But, of course, any simpleton fool knows that it is the volcanic tuffs above and below the fossils that were dated, and any simpleton fool knows that carbon 14 wasn't used because rocks can't be dated using carbon 14, and any simpleton fool knows that you can't directly date the fossils themselves.\n \nAnd just because you say they are \"rock\" is ridiculous.\nDo you know what fossils are? Do you know what the process of fossilization is? Do you know you are making yourself look foolish?\n \nDinosaurs have been dated with carbon 14 and have shown a date of less than 15,000 years....\nHow foolish can one person be. You are quite the dupe.\n \nand besides that, fossilization can happen quite rapidly. Petrified wood can petrify in just a few years.\nNot generally. It takes quite a long time.\n \nThe whole thing is an atheist scam here and the atheists are too scared to back themselves up by ruling out that erectus was young.\nWhat does atheism have to do with it? Again, you don't seem to understand that all H. erectus fossils that can be dated have been dated and it has been conclusively ruled out that they are young. They all date somewhere between 1.8 million and 300,000 years ago.\n \nAnd by the way.....\n \n http://redrival.com/evolusi/humevol5.htm\n \n In the past, Homo erectus and Neanderthal Man were depicted as subhuman beasts; now everyone admits that they are very similar to modern humans. Because HY had considered australopiths were not bipedal and just extinct apes, this similarity led him into concluding that humans appear suddenly in the fossil record, a clear indication for a special act of creation, detaching humans from apes \nSo you are back to being duped by your fundamentalist, Muslim master. If you knew a bit more about the topic you might be able to tell when you are being lied to. Notice the red herring about \"subhuman beasts.\" It really is a laugh.\n [QUOTE=supersport;246857]http://www.gla.ac.uk/hunterian/collections/museum/hominid/oldsite/Sect2/guid13.4.html\n \n The first true humans\n \n The first widespread form of early man was Homo erectus. \n \n Evidence of Early Human Occupation in England\n \nhttp://archaeology.about.com/od/homoerectus/a/pakefield.htm\nWhy weren't those fossils dated? Oh! yeah. There weren't any fossils found. They found evidence of tools in a stream bed and dated them by the rocks around them.\n \nand if you can get passed the stupid racial depiction...take a look at this site:\n \n \n Homo erectus (or the various species which may be subsumed under that appellation) are extremely important in the study of modern human origins. The Middle Pleistocene is where the modern human postcrania develops, the modern cranial features begin to develop, and significant increases in brain size occur. It is also important because many behavioral changes occur in this time period, e.g., much more developed lithic industries, the controlled use of fire, regular meat-eating, hunting, etc. This is where the things most people consider \"human\" start to develop to the point where most people would recognize these pattern of anatomy and behavior as human. This is also a dynamic time in the evolutionary perspective caused by these species, with the recent well-dated Dmanisi remains in the Republic of Georgia, dated to 1.7 myr. \n \n http://www.archaeologyinfo.com/homoerectus.htm\nSo you are not aware that these beings were probably black? What is racist about reality? And developing to a point that most people would start to recognize human patterns of anatomy is not modern human. They are \"starting to be human\" and you think that it means just like you? Well, we really don't know. Maybe your brain is only about 900 cc.",

The chimp is there for comparison with early hominan specimens that are very ape-like.\n \nAnd I'd be willing to be that most of these skulls were dated by the rocks surrounding them at the time of death.\nNo. That has already been explained to you. Pay attention. It is the strata that are deposited before and after the stratum that includes the fossils that are dated, or if the fossil is buried in an appropriate type of rock, that may be dated.

Another example of you lack of understanding of the topic is your failure to understand why very old fossils are found on the surface and the principles of dating from geologic strata.\n \n Quite honestly....you are so immoral and so unable to tell the truth I have no desire to even attempt to debate you. You can just sprew lies like they are nothing. I've already given you a link that shows how dinosaurs have been dated with radiocarbon at just a few thousand years old. Here it is and more.\n \n http://www.theforbiddenknowledge.com/hardtruth/carbon_14.htm\n \n http://www.blacksheepbistro.com/dinodatingpage.htm\n \n http://www.orgsites.com/oh/evoution-is-a-myth/_pgg1.php3\n \n Bone fragments from the 30 ft. long Acrocanthosaurus dinosaur, excavated by members of CEM (creation Evidence museum) of Glen Rose TX and CRSEF of Columbus OH. Were subjected to the radiocarbon dating process at three different laboratories. The table below lists these dates and those of four other samples from four separate excavations of other dinosaurs; three came from the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh PA. The dates ranged from about 9,890 to 36,500! \n \n \n  Another simple example can be found at Laetoli in Tanzania. The site is not far from the Olduvai Gorge. Just below the surface there is a layer of volcanic ash, known as a tuff. It is one of many in the area that are used to date fossils. Volcanic ash is an ideal stratum for radiometric dating (but not carbon 14 dating). The volcanic ash at Laetoli has been dated to 3.7 million years, and the tuff above it to less than 3.7 million, and the one below it to more than 3.7 million. Thus, fossils found below that layer are older than 3.7 million years, and fossils found above it are younger than 3.7 million years. Do you understand why that is true, SS? It's a simple geologic concept; deeper layers are older than the layers on top of them.\n \n If you think fossils can be accurately dated in volcanic ash you've got a screw lose. The dating of objects in the wake of Mount St Helens should have shown you that.\n \n http://dlinde.nl/schepping/Excess%20Argon%20at%20Mount%20St_%20Helens.htm\n \n The conventional K-Ar dating method was applied to the 1986 dacite flow from the new lava dome at Mount St. Helens, Washington. Porphyritic dacite which solidified on the surface of the lava dome in 1986 gives a whole rock K-Ar 'age ' of 0.35 \u00b1 0.05 million years (Ma). Mineral concentrates from the dacite which formed in 1986 give K-Ar 'ages 'from 0.34 \u00b1 0.06 Ma (feldspar-glass concentrate) to 2.8 \u00b1 0.6 Ma (pyroxene concentrate). These 'ages 'are, of course, preposterous. The fundamental dating assumption ('no radiogenic argon was present when the rock formed ') is questioned by these data. Instead, data from this Mount St. Helens dacite argue that significant 'excess argon 'was present when the lava solidified in 1986. Phenocrysts of orthopyroxene, hornblende and plagioclase are interpreted to have occluded argon within their mineral structures deep in the magma chamber and to have retained this argon after emplacement and solidification of the dacite. The amount of argon occluded is probably a function of the argon pressure when mineral crystallization occurred at depth and/or the tightness of the mineral structure. Orthopyroxene retains the most argon, followed by hornblende, and finally, plagioclase. The lava dome at Mount St. Helens dates very much older than its true age because phenocryst minerals inherit argon from the magma. The study of this Mount St. Helens dacite causes the more fundamental question to be asked-how accurate are K-Ar 'ayes 'from the many other phenocryst-containing lava flows world-wide?\n \n Anyway, in that volcanic tuff lots and lots of footprints of various animals have been found. Thus, we know that those footprints are 3.7 years old.\n \n and you're the King of England.\n \n \n So this Turkana boy is dated at least 1.5 million years old based on skull morphology. \n \n Peeling has already done a nice job of pointing out your foolishness here. But, yes, the skulls are lined up according to the dates of the strata in which they were found. Talk origins lined them up that way because they show the historical progression of fossils that illustrates the transition from very ape-like, to more and more human-like.\n \n The heck they are. All you guys have to do to claim that is to claim \"erosion.\"....Even if a stupid fossil is laying on top of the ground. So in otherwords, if it's deep under the ground you're covered as well as if the fossil is laying on top of the ground -- like many dinosaur fossils are. Not only that but there are hundreds -- thousands -- of these skulls and they're spread out all over the globe -- Europe, Asia, Africa etc. If you think each and every one of these skulls was found in some sort of corresponding layer of the earth, you are one gullible sucker. The skulls that T.O. lined up were not found in a perfect line of strata, all they've done is line up the skulls as their pre-conceived notion tells them they should be lined up....nothing more. I'd be willing to be that the majority of fossil finds are found at or just below the surface....and the only thing you can then claim is that the mysterious soil must have eroded....which proves once again that your \"proof\" is unseen.\n \n \n The remark was made about you lying about Richard Leakey making that statement.

   "Actually, it is quite apparent that you do not. For one glaring example, below you incorrectly state that a dinosaur fossil has been dated by C-14. Another example of you lack of understanding of the topic is your failure to understand why very old fossils are found on the surface and the principles of dating from geologic strata.\nQuite honestly....you are so immoral and so unable to tell the truth I have no desire to even attempt to debate you. You can just sprew lies like they are nothing. I've already given you a link that shows how dinosaurs have been dated with radiocarbon at just a few thousand years old. Here it is and more.\nYou just seem to be unable to actually discuss anything without calling names. It is a sure sign that you know that you are in over your head. Exactly how is telling you the truth immoral? Everything I have told you can be verified. You have no desire to debate me because I help you make yourself look foolish. You need to grow up. Either you can hold up your end or you cannot. So far, not only have you not been able to hold up your end, you have admitted that you cannot.\n \n By the way, all of those dinosaur fossil datings by carbon 14 that you gave us are actually the same one. You have a single example by Carl Baugh, a religious zealot without any scientific knowledge. This is the guy who claimed to have found human footprints along with dinosaur tracks. When every one of his tracks was shown to be a fraud, a dinosaur track, or an erosion hole, Baugh then found human tracks inside the dinosaur tracks. The man is a XXXXX with a bogus PhD. He has destroyed more than one dinosaur track in the Paluxy River because he is such a dunce. What kind of idiot would pour plaster of paris into a track in a limestone river bed?\n \n By the way, the huge range of dates that are cited in your references should be a sure sign that there are problems. It pretty much indicates contamination. My bet is that Baugh didn't know enough to keep his hands off of the specimens. Even your cited article mentions that some were preserved with shellac.\n \nAnother simple example can be found at Laetoli in Tanzania. The site is not far from the Olduvai Gorge. Just below the surface there is a layer of volcanic ash, known as a tuff. It is one of many in the area that are used to date fossils. Volcanic ash is an ideal stratum for radiometric dating (but not carbon 14 dating). The volcanic ash at Laetoli has been dated to 3.7 million years, and the tuff above it to less than 3.7 million, and the one below it to more than 3.7 million. Thus, fossils found below that layer are older than 3.7 million years, and fossils found above it are younger than 3.7 million years. Do you understand why that is true, SS? It's a simple geologic concept; deeper layers are older than the layers on top of them.\nIf you think fossils can be accurately dated in volcanic ash you've got a screw lose. The dating of objects in the wake of Mount St Helens should have shown you that.\nYet another example of how you are a dupe. It seems that you don't know the difference between ash fall and lava flow in a volcano. No matter. The problem of correct sample collection is well known among qualified geologists. Austin should know better. (By the way, Steve Austin claimed to have been converted to young earth creationism when he visited Mount St. Helens. I guess he thought that no one was aware that he had been writing creationist articles for the ICR all the way through his graduate studies. How's that for honesty?) But the point is that you don't seem to know that every rock that comes out of a volcano is not appropriate for dating. Austin knows better, but you are a mere dupe who just parrots what you don't understand.\n \nAnyway, in that volcanic tuff lots and lots of footprints of various animals have been found. Thus, we know that those footprints are 3.7 years old.\nand you're the King of England.\nEngland does not currently have a king. I would have expected that you would have known that. I see that I goofed and left off the \"million\" in that particular reference. Fortunately, you seem to have understood since I had already made several mentions to 3.7 million years.\n \n But I digress. Volcanic tuffs are actually very good sources of material for dating. The reason is that rock has been reduced to ash, which means that all radiometric clocks were reset by the high temperatures. The case is different with lava flows. Some inclusions may not have reached high enough temperatures and may yield bad dates. That hypothesis was actually tested and supported, and then reported in a scientific journal. Creationists like to refer to that paper as evidence that radiometric dating is unreliable, while the purpose of the paper was to show that great care was need in the selection of samples for dating.\n \nSo this Turkana boy is dated at least 1.5 million years old based on skull morphology. \nYou're being dishonest here. You are cutting relevant discussion. It was pointed out to you that dating was not done based on skull morphology.\n \nPeeling has already done a nice job of pointing out your foolishness here. But, yes, the skulls are lined up according to the dates of the strata in which they were found. Talk origins lined them up that way because they show the historical progression of fossils that illustrates the transition from very ape-like, to more and more human-like.\nThe heck they are. All you guys have to do to claim that is to claim \"erosion.\"....Even if a stupid fossil is laying on top of the ground. So in otherwords, if it's deep under the ground you're covered as well as if the fossil is laying on top of the ground -- like many dinosaur fossils are. You guys are the kings of nonsense.\nI just can't believe that anyone would be so ignorant of what erosion can do. You make yourself look foolish when you claim that anything old can't be found on the surface.\n \nThe remark was made about you lying about Richard Leakey making that statement. You don't actually know that he ever said such a thing. You are allowing yourself to be duped by your fundamentalist Muslim master. You never read that book and actually have no idea of what Leakey was saying. Using out of context quotes, especially when you rob them from other fundamentalist Muslim creationists, isn't honest.\nDuped, XXXX...I've got his stupid book, where he starts out talking how he was walking in a dry creekbed and looked down saw a dang 2-3 million year old skull staring at him. Right.\nWrong. You've got the wrong book. That's not the book from which your quote was taken. Nice job there.\n \nI am perfectly aware of what Homo erectus means. However, you again reveal you ignorance. The name doesn't imply that H. erectus was the \"first one\" (whatever that means). Nor was he the first to use tools. There are older examples of H. habilis, H. rudolfensis, and H. ergaster.\nI gave you the links. I noticed you didn't read them. One evolutionist link was even titled \"the first human beings\" or something like that.\nActually, I did read them. It is sad that you don't seem to have done so.\n \nAnother cognitive disconnect? Since no body mentioned apes your comment appears quite bizarre. Moreover, H. erectus isn't a \"human being\" because human beings are called Homo sapiens.\nthat's according to you and the other atheists who have to label people based on their skulls.\nWhat does atheism have to do with it and how do you know that I am one? It seems that you are now getting down to the real whining about how you look like a fool because of some atheist plot.\n \nI'm done...you're exhausting and debating you is a waste of time because not only do you not know what you're talking about but you seem have no problem at all being blantantly dishonest.\nThere you go. Tuck tail and run. But finish off with a childish \"are too, are too\" comment. I dare you to point out even a single case where I was dishonest. Since you need to fall back on insult and you admit that you have lost any sort of \"debate\". There actually was no debate. You posted ignorance from both fundamentalist christian and fundamentalist Muslim sites that you lacked the knowledge to understand. You were duped. I merely explained your errors.\n \n So now I suppose that you aren't going to respond to me again. As usual, that won't stop me from helping you make yourself look foolish. You can go back to trying to hide responses inside answers to others. But you aren't fooling anyone but yourself.",

I have no desire to debate such dishonesty.\nApparently you don't know much about fossils or fossilization. First, the \"datings\" that you referenced were the work of Carl Baugh, a fraud. Second, fossils of the age of the specimens that Baugh claims to have dated would no longer have any organic material remaining. It would have been replaced by minerals many millions of years ago in a process known as fossilization. Thus, any fool knows that you can't take pieces of fossil, that is essentially rock, and carbon 14 date them. You see, carbon 14 dating can only be used on organic material, and since all of the original carbon is gone, what is being dated is modern contamination of the specimens by modern carbon. That could come from Mr. Baugh's hands when he handled and scraped the fossils, or it could come from the shellac used to preserve them. It's not the first time that an anti-evolutionist has taken a fossil and had it dated without proper preparation. Another possibility is that one of your links is correct and that there are kerogenous hydrocarbons in the Haversian canals. My bet is, simplesort, that you don't know what that says. Well, I'll tell you. Kerogens are organic molecules that make up a portion of the organic matter in sedimentary rock. That these kerogenous hydrocarbons fill the Haversian canals indicates that they were not part of the original organism. That means that they were carried there by water. Thus, they are not appropriate for carbon 14 dating the fossil since there is no way to determine when these foreign carbon compounds were deposited there. The dating, even if done properly, will return bogus dates.\n \n That even the creationists are calling these \"hydrocarbons\" should tell you something. You probably know them by another name, i.e., oil.\n \n So the \"dating\" isn't legitimate since it isn't the \"dinosaur\" that was dated. Let me again point out the wide range of dates from the same sample or samples from the same fossil. When date ranges are that great then it should raise a red flag that something is wrong. The first suspect is contamination. Let me again point out to you that you can't date rocks with carbon 14, not even coal. To do so and represent any results as meaningful is dishonest and those who accept such dates uncritically are dupes.\n \n So everyone wave to simplesort as he tucks his tail between his legs and runs away. He knows that he has been spanked soundly and his answer is to pout and skulk away. Just because he doesn't talk to me anymore, doesn't mean that I can't continue to point out his foolish errors.

   "My evidence is there is no proof in the fossil record -- no common ancestor --\nOnly scientific illiterates talk about \"proof\" in science. Science is the investigation of natural phenomena through observation, theoretical observation, and experimentation, or the knowledge produced by such investigation. It works by means of the scientific method that goes from observation to hypothesis to prediction to experimental testing. It is irrational not to accept scientific theories that have passed rigorous testing until a better theory, that explains everything better, has been tested. That's the nature of peer review.\n \n So essentially what you are saying is that your evidence is that there is no evidence. I guess you've never heard the old dictum that lack of evidence is not evidence. So I guess we can conclude that you have no evidence. However, you are wrong anyway. There is evidence in the fossil record. A simple example is picture that illustrates the historical progression of hominid skulls through time. But of course, you don't like it so you pretend that it doesn't exist and repeat assertions that have been shown to be wrong. So there is evidence, and lots of it since there are lots more examples similar fossils.\n \n As for a common ancestor, that is a conclusion drawn from the evidence. By the age and morphology of various fossils hominan fossils have been grouped into about about 16 paleontological species. Since as many as 5 of these groupings have been identified that all lived at the same time, about 2 million years ago, they can't all be ancestral to modern humans, and possibly none of them are, although our ancestor was probably quite like at one of them.\n \n Of course, there is some doubt about what you mean when you say \"common ancestor.\" Do you mean that all humans on earth do not share a common ancestor? But you claimed before that Homo erectus was a human being, so do we share a common ancestor with H. erectus? How about with chimps? Do we share a common ancestor?\n \nand there is no molecular evidence that it's even possible.\nActually, there is. And quite a lot of it. If you are interested in learning you might ask a poster here known as SLP. He posted in a couple of threads. He is Ph.D. in biology and as part of his doctoral thesis did work on the molecular evidence of the relationships between various primates. He's between semesters now and was probably bored and came back to visit. Basically, as I remember his discussions, he did work in DNA-DNA hybridization. It was found that humans and chimps have about 98.4% similarity in DNA. Bonobos are about the same. Gorillas are a bit more distant and Orangs a bit more than that. Of course, more recent work, now that the genomes of both humans and chimps has been sequenced, has found that most of the differences between chimps and humans is in the non-coding, non-functional parts of the genome. The problem now is why we are so different from chimps when there is so little difference in our genetic makeup.\n \n(by the way, read better next time -- I said we did not evolve from chimps.)\nYou are correct and there isn't anyone knowledgeable in evolutionary theory who would claim otherwise. Shooterandproud tried to pull a switch on you. Not only are we descended from primates, we are primates. Cladistically speaking, not only are we descended from apes, we are apes. Humans are primates and great apes and we share a common ancestor with the chimps and bonobos, and before that with gorillas.\n \n Better luck next time, simplesort.",

That could come from Mr. Baugh's hands when he handled and scraped the fossils, or it could come from the shellac used to preserve them. It's not the first time that an anti-evolutionist has taken a fossil and had it dated without proper preparation.\nHow can you say that without any proof of such?\nBut the article that you linked said that it was not carbon from the organism. And Baugh is such an amateur that he wouldn't know how to collect a sample for dating.\n \nWhy do you not question every other test done on rocks and animals done by evolutionists?\nI do.\n \nMaybe they were all tainted as well. The fact that science won't even TRY to test dinosaurs or homo erectus is quite telling: it tells the average person that they're good-for-nothing.\nActually, the papers that report the dating results pretty much confirm that they aren't tainted. Such results are published in scientific journals, not on the internet. And it would be stupid to waste lots of money in dating inappropriate fossils. Their age is known by appropriate dating methods.\n \nAnother possibility is that one of your links is correct and that there are kerogenous hydrocarbons in the Haversian canals. My bet is, simplesort, that you don't know what that says. Well, I'll tell you. Kerogens are organic molecules that make up a portion of the organic matter in sedimentary rock. That these kerogenous hydrocarbons fill the Haversian canals indicates that they were not part of the original organism. That means that they were carried there by water. Thus, they are not appropriate for carbon 14 dating the fossil since there is no way to determine when these foreign carbon compounds were deposited there. The dating, even if done properly, will return bogus dates.\nYou are so desperate, it's hilarious. You'll grasp at any straw.\nI see I was correct. You don't know what kerogens or hydrocarbons are. I am quite certain that you don't know what Haversian canals are. You just can't give any rational answer, can you? There's that tail between the legs again as you run away.\n \nSo the \"dating\" isn't legitimate since it isn't the \"dinosaur\" that was dated. Let me again point out the wide range of dates from the same sample or samples from the same fossil. When date ranges are that great then it should raise a red flag that something is wrong. The first suspect is contamination. Let me again point out to you that you can't date rocks with carbon 14, not even coal. To do so and represent any results as meaningful is dishonest and those who accept such dates uncritically are dupes.\nwide range of dates occurs with virtually every test on every sample. That's part of the game. The fact that there was obviously carbon still left in the bones is the whole point.\nBut it wasn't part of the organism. Carbon is everywhere and dating inappropriate samples gives nonsense dates. However, if done properly, the range of variation reported in you link was extreme. It's part of the game only in that such variation means that there is something very wrong and reporting such dates to the scientific community would be laughed at.",

You, on the other hand, merely make assertions and link creationist web sites.\n \n1) the man in question is a liar\nIndeed. See the article linked by johnhanks.\n \n2) that he deliberately falsifies bones for testing\nWhat nonsense. Is this another of your cognitive disconnects? The point is that he chooses inappropriate samples for dating and probably mishandles them. He knows the conclusions he wants to reach and also knows that dating inappropriate material will yield nonsense C-14 dates. But it's good enough to dupe the ignorant.\n \n2) that he's an idiot\nAgain, refer to the article linked by johnhanks. The guy can't be too sharp when other creationists laugh at him. Also note that Mr. Kent Hovind quotes Baugh and Hovind's teaching and science has been rejected by AIG.\n \n3) that the samples that he submitted were tainted\nProbably. Or, as pointed out in the very article that you linked, the carbon that was dated was not part of the original organism but came from other organic matter that had filled the Haversian canals at a later date. Of course, you would have to actually be educated in the matter before you would realize that material in the Haversian canals is not part of the original organism and therefore any date by any means would only show that the fossil is older than that, how much older could not be determined.\n \n4) that creationist websites dupe people\nTrue. They are able to do so because most creationists are scientific illiterates. You are a pretty good example.\n \nIt doesn't matter which one it is, pandion throws them all out there so something will stick. Pandion...you don't know jack XXXX.\nMaybe so, but I know lots more than you do.\n \nThe fact is we are dealing with an atheistic scientific community who are a bunch of chickens.\nWhat does atheism have to do with it? You are confused. We are talking about science, i.e., the dating of fossils.\n \nThey have no problem dating some skulls (which are found at or near the surface of the ground) via carbon 14 but they have a BIG problem dating other skulls found at or near the top of the ground via carbon 14.\nWhat is the big deal about your at or near the surface XXXX. Why don't you actually make an effort to learn why. I've asked before but you never answer. Do you know what erosion is?\n \nThey have no problem dating Neanderthals, but simply will not date homo erectus -- and it's ONLY because of the contour of their skull.\nNo. It has nothing to do with the shape of the skull. The H. erectus skulls are esentially rocks. All of the organic material has been replaced by minerals. That is not true of Neandertal skulls, which are much younger. Not only is there still organic material remaining, they have been able to extract mtDNA (8 times I think) from various Neandertal specimens. As I recall, they were around 30,000 years old. That's still in the range of datable by C-14. The age of a H. erectus at about 1 million years is beyond the range of C-14 dating by about a factor of 20.\n \nAnd the fact is, Neanderthal and homo erectus skulls look VERY similar, the only difference being size\nActually, they don't. Neandertals, H. neanderthalensis, had an average brain size that was slightly larger than modern man. The shape of the skull is quite distinctive. Anyone who has actually looked at the skulls with just a little knowledge can see that they are quite different. However, that is not to say that a H. erectus like being was not ancestral to the Neandertals, just as such a being was ancestral to modern humans, in both cases through some other transitional species. For example, H. heidelbergensis shows a mixture of characteristics between H. erectus and the Neandertals. Fossils of this type have been found in both Europe and Africa. They are around 400,000 years old. They have a larger brain than H. erectus, generally more pronounced brow ridges, a less projecting face, and seem to be developing the occipital bun that is typical of Neandertals.\n \n...so to say one is maybe 2 million years older than the other without TESTING it is ridiculous.\nThey have been tested from many sites from around the world and found to be of ages that center on about 1 million years, the oldest being about 1.8 million. Only XXXXXX say that H. erectus is claimed to be 2 million years old. Not sure what you mean by \"without TESTING.\" As has already been explained, they are too old to return any sort of useful date by C-14.\n \nBut this is just a symtom of atheism. Likewise the atheists scientists are so dishonest they won't even bother trying to date dinosaurs via carbon 14....and their reason??? -- \"they're too old!\"\nWhat does atheism have to do with it? I know evolutionary biologists who are devout Christians. Even Dr. Mary Schweitzer is a Christian. And, of course, I'm sure that someone would be willing to date any old dinosaur bone that you want if you come up with the money. The reason that dinosaur fossils aren't dated by C-14 is that they are rock. Not datable by C-14, and yes, they are much, much too old by orders of magnitude.\n \nHey Pandion....what if a big guy who was 6'6, wore a red hat, carried a sawed off shotgun, drove a blue 1967 Ford Mustang walked into a bank and robbed it -- but left finger prints on the counter.....and then the police tracked down a person who drove a blue 1967 Mustang and he happened to live in the area and the police searched his house and found a red hat and a sawed off shotgun? ....and then attempted to fingerprint him....but then his wife proclaimed \"Oh, He didn't do it...he's too nice to do something like that.\" Should the police just say \"Ok, well then let's not fingerprint him -- it's obviously not him.\"\nWhat does that have to do with performing an inappropriate test on a rock? Fingerprinting a suspect is entirely appropriate. You can't date rocks by C-14 and the rock in question is too old anyway.\n \n Here's what you are asking. You believe someone broke into your house and used one of your dinner plates and then ran it through the dish washer. You call the police hand them the dinner plate and have them look for finger prints. Sure enough, they find some, yours and theirs.

Some say that the features are like modem Homo sapiens in some areas. (7) Campbell, in 1964. labeled it Homo sapiens rhodesiensis.(8) \n \n \n and this original link that shows how it's skull is \"stangely similar\" to Neanderthal.\n \n http://www.amendez.com/Early%20Man%20Seminar%20Poster/EMSP%20Rhodesian%20Man-text.pdf\n \n \n \n \n Neandertals, H. neanderthalensis, had an average brain size that was slightly larger than modern man. The shape of the skull is quite distinctive. Anyone who has actually looked at the skulls with just a little knowledge can see that they are quite different. \n \n I just proved that wrong.\n \n \n \n However, that is not to say that a H. erectus like being was not ancestral to the Neandertals, just as such a being was ancestral to modern humans, in both cases through some other transitional species. For example, H. heidelbergensis shows a mixture of characteristics between H. erectus and the Neandertals. Fossils of this type have been found in both Europe and Africa. They are around 400,000 years old. They have a larger brain than H. erectus, generally more pronounced brow ridges, a less projecting face, and seem to be developing the occipital bun that is typical of Neandertals.\n \n The skulls are quite similar, save size. This is not enough of a difference to not date them with carbon 14.",

That is what erosion does, it strips of layers of rock and soil, revealing new layers, and giving a chance of exposing some fossils. However, the layer it is found in at one location is very often below other layers in another location where erosion has not occured as much, thus the dating by strata. While many are found near the surface, many more are currently unexposed, and some day will be exposed.

   "[snip of continued lack of comprehension of how and why fossils are found near the surface. Intentional ignorance can't be corrected.]\n\n \nPaleontologists don't even get to see them! They're locked away in a vault somewhere. All they have to go on is pictures and cheap plastic casts.\nMore intentional ignorance. The fossils are quite freely available to qualified individuals. However, for most uses the casts are quite good and they are enough for at least preliminary studies. And they are not \"cheap plastic\" as the casts themselves are quite expensive, being time consuming and to produce with quite costly materials. You can buy some cheap casts and replicas for a few hundred dollars, but the ones that are used for study cost more. I have a cheap replica of Archaeopteryx lithographica that cost me about $150. You couldn't use it for any meaningful study, but the cast at the Museum of Natural Science is quite good and quite expensive.\n \nyou don't know that either. Prove it.\nFor a while I handled fossils on a daily basis - real ones, not casts. They are rock. Why is it that you think that petrified wood is called petrified wood. Or is it that you don't know the meaning of \"petrified?\" The process of fossilization is the replacement of organic material with minerals. Please stop with the intentional ignorance.\n \nhow do you know? You haven't dated erectus....\nBut others have. Others who actually know what they are doing.\n \nwell obviously the scientists doing the tests were XXXXXX and dishonest and the skulls were tainted. The tests don't count.\nActually, since the work has been repeated at least 8 times, and in at least one other case some nuclear DNA was extracted and sequenced, the science was legitimate. None of the science who worked on the DNA extraction from Neandertals is a known fraud working hard to dupe semiliterate christians.\n \n[Actually they do:\nActually, not even all of the H. erectus were the same species. Take KNM-ER 3733 and Sangiran 17 for example. The first has a less projecting face, much larger and projecting brow ridges and a higher vault to the skull. The brow ridges are even larger than those of Neandertals. However, the face and nasal structures of KNM-ER 3733 are much smaller than corresponding Neandertal structures. Of course, KNM-ER 3733 completely lacks the occipital bun. On the other hand, Sangiran 17 has a face that projects well forward with less pronounced brow ridges than either KNM-ER 3733 or Neandertals. The skull also has a lower vault than either of the others, which is apparently compensated for by extension at the back of the skull. However, it isn't nearly as large as the Neandertal occipital bun.\n \nThe American paleoanthropologist Alan Walker said that he doubted that \"the average pathologist could tell the difference between the fossil skeleton and that of a modern human.\"\nProbably true, and at first glance it does look much like a modern human. But if one has a little bit of education then the differences in the relative lengths of the arms, the longer neck on the femur, and the marked flaring of the rib cage from top to bottom is quite apparent. These are well outside the range of modern humans.\n \nTherefore, Homo erectus is also a modern human race.\nIntentional ignorance is so laughable.\n \nand this original link that shows how it's skull is \"stangely similar\" to Neanderthal.\nSimilar until you actually look closely after educating yourself.\n \nI just proved that wrong.\nNo you didn't. You asserted it was wrong because you misunderstand what you read and you have been duped.\n \nThe skulls are quite similar, save size.\nOnly if you refuse to educate yourself and continue to allow yourself to be duped by dishonest ministers.\n \nThis is not enough of a difference to not date them with carbon 14.\nThat is not why they are not dated by C 14.

The face has protruding jaws, no chin, thick brow ridges, and a brain size ranging from 750 to 1225 cc. The skeletons are more robust than those of modern humans. Erectus likely had a very efficient walking style, and probably used fire as well. In addition, their stone tools are much better than those of habilis. Some of the most famous early archaeological finds were skeletal remains of Homo erectus, including the 1893 discovery \"Java Man\", the \"Heidelberg Marn\", the \"Peking Man\", and the \"Turkana Boy\" shown in the picture on the right. Erectus also turned out to be the creater of many of the stone tools and Chellean handaxes found at the Olduvai site by the Leakeys, the so-called \"Chellean Man\". Erectus was likely the first hominid to spread across the world, as the migrated to China by 800,000 years ago and to Europe by 500,000. However, by 300,000 years ago they were to be replaced by a new hominid - Homo Sapiens. \n \n checkmate, losers.\n \n now tell me again...what is the transitional species between homo erectus (HUMANS) and apes.....\n \n and don't forget:\n \n http://www.mnh.si.edu/anthro/humanorigins/ha/a_tree.html (they don't know either.)",

Are you less human than neanderthal because your brain is smaller?\n\n \n From: http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/a_brains.html\n \"Hrdlicka (1939) examined the extremes of brain size in the 12,000 American skulls stored in the U.S. National Museum collections. Of these, the smallest 29, or fewer than 1 in 400, ranged from 910 to 1050 cc. Hrdlicka states that the smallest skull in this collection, at 910 cc, appears to be the lowest volume ever measured for a normal human cranium. The low volume skulls were not primitive or aberrant in any way; their small volume was merely a result of the smallness of the entire skull. So although the extreme lower range of modern human brain sizes does overlap that of Homo erectus, their skulls are very different: in H. erectus, the brain case really is smaller in relation to the rest of the skull. In small modern humans, the skull proportions are normal and the brain size is small only because the skull is small.\"\n \n So not only did it have a smaller cranial capacity, it was smaller in ratio to modern humans. So, your point is moot.\n \n \nbi-pedal...even if it were true -- which is highly questionable....does not make a monkey/ape a human.\n\n Actually, it does. Bipedalism is one of the traits that seperates Homo from the other great apes. And if you had studied anything at all about primate evolution, you would know that dentition is a big factor.\n \n \nhow would you know?? you can't see their skeltons.\n\n But we can see their skulls, and compare them to features present in ape skulls\n \n \n \nscience should be about proof. Anything else is philosophy.\n\n Prove to me that the sun is goint to rise in the east tomorrow. Prove to me, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that this will occur. You can say it is quite likely, as it has been doing so for recorded time, but that's all you can do.\n \n \n \nNo they're not.\n\n Because you say so?",

   "I thought Homo sapiens was the correct term now. I only thought that H. sapiens sapiens applied if H. neandertalensis was actually H. sapiens neandertalensis. Didn't the DNA recovered from Neandertal prove Neandertals were a seperate species?\nI think that mtDNA has been recovered from 8 different Neandertal specimens along with mtDNA sequences from 5 early modern humans (about 30,000 years or so). I believe that there has also been some nuclear DNA recovered from at least one Neandertal specimen.\n \n I referred to modern humans as H. sapiens sapiens because I had the Herto skulls from Ethiopia in mind, the oldest modern human fossils yet found (@ 160,000 years). They are classified as H. sapiens idaltu. They are chronologically and morphologically intermediate between older archaic humans and modern humans. Some features are an elongated but narrower skull as compared to modern humans. The forehead is slightly sloped, but still more vertical than Neandertals, and certainly more vertical than H. erectus. There is a slight brow ridge. However, these characteristics and others are slightly outside of the range of variation in modern humans while being distinctly different from archaic forms. But the lower face doesn't project forward. \n \nI may have it up the spout, I work on things between 160 and 110 million years old at the moment.

In fact, H. erectus was not even archaic human.\nThis is all fairytale based on nonthing but wild imaginations.\nNope. It is based on the morphology of both the skull and the post cranial skeleton.\n \nHomo erectus was every bit as human as you are. Just because scientists call it a different \"species\" doens't make it be.\nWhat? Exactly how do you think that different paleontological species are determined? Is there some rule that determines if a specimen if a different species? It is called a different species because experts called paleoanthropologists and physical anthropologists group them into named species based on morphology, both differences and likeness with other fossils. And H. erectus isn't \"every bit as human as\" I am. My brain is more than 300 cc larger the the average erectus. I'm also a bit taller than the tallest erectus ever found. But I didn't say that H. erectus wasn't human, just not modern human - not one of all the humans I have ever known - a different species. I don't know about you. How big is your brain? Do you have a chin? How about a brow ridge? Does your forehead slope? Is your face at the front of you brain as compared to under the brain?\n \nIt's nice that you just claim anything you want without any evidence for it.\njust like you don't have any evidence that homo erectus is a different \"species.\" The reality is, I can -- and will -- show that head, face, jaw, and skull features are shaped and molded by diet and environment. hang tight.\nPossibly somewhat, but not to the extent that you could make anyone look like H. erectus.. Anyway, I have been telling you about the evidence that indicates that H. erectus was a different species, the differences in morphology. I have even named some of the fossils so that you can go and look them up yourself. You can lead a horse to water but you can't make him clean up his act.\n \nThat's the beauty of creationism, you get to make it up as you go.\nIt's the other way around.\nSo you mean that since you get to make it up as you go, that makes creationism attractive.\n \nBut (homo erectus) different in important characteristics like brain size.\nSo what? It was smaller in stature too. Of course it's going to have a smaller brain.\nNope. Doesn't add up. H. erectus averaged about 5' 10\". Just how tall is the average modern human? Yet, the average size of the erectus brain was only about 75% the size of modern humans.\n \nJust like neanderthals had larger brains because their bodies were much bigger and denser.\nBut Neandertals weren't that much bigger than us, in fact they averaged about 5'5\" tall. Moreover, their average brain size was only about 100 cc more, whereas modern human brain size averages between 300 and 400 cc larger than H. erectus. Remember, H. erectus averaged about 5'10\" tall.\n \nAre you less human than neanderthal because your brain is smaller?\nWho ever said anything about being less human? Are you daft. I said that H. erectus is not a modern human.\n \nActually, it is very ape-like, except that it was bipedal and the dentation differed from apes. It was more human-like.\nbi-pedal...even if it were true -- which is highly questionable....does not make a monkey/ape a human.\nWhether you like it or not, there are lots of ways that you can tell if an organism is bipedal or not. The point is that the very old hominids had a mixture of characters between ape and human. They were transitional species. I never claimed that they were human.\n \nSome very human like apes in that bunch.\nhow would you know?? you can't see their skeltons.\nI understand. You are saying that since you haven't tried to educate yourself in the matter that you cannot address it intelligently. You don't know whether these are human-like or not because you haven't tried to learn.\n \nOnly XXXXXX talk about proof in a scientific context.\nscience should be about proof. Anything else is philosophy.\nCan you prove that Pluto and Charon orbit the sun? You're just whining now.\n \nThey are transitional species between an ape-like ancestor and modern humans, just as H. erectus was.\nNo they're not.\nAn answer worth of a 2nd grader.",
