   "Matt Foreman: Celebrating The Gains Of Underdog LGBT Groups\nBy any objective measure, the LGBT movement has made extraordinary progress in a short period of time. In just the last 10 years:[*]The number of states (including the District of Columbia) protecting lesbian, gay and bisexual people from discrimination almost doubled to 22, and these states cover 44 percent of the U.S. population.\n \n [*]The number of states (including the District of Columbia) extending marriage equality or \"all-but-marriage\" rights to same-sex couples grew from just one to 14 (including three more this year), and these states cover 36 percent of the U.S. population.\n \n [*]The number of states (including the District of Columbia) protecting transgender people from discrimination jumped from one to 16 (including three more this year), and these states cover 29 percent of the U.S. population.\n \n [*]Anti-gay policies going back hundreds of years have been repealed in four of the five leading mainline Protestant denominations (including the Presbyterian Church USA in May).These broad gains don't begin to tell the whole story. If you look at what's been happening in towns and cities and among American businesses on these issues over the past decade, you also see the LGBT-rights cause advancing by leaps and bounds. The number of gay student alliances in U.S. high schools has surged to nearly 5,000, we're seeing more and more LGBT-inclusive safe schools laws, and nine out of ten Fortune 500 companies have adopted nondiscrimination policies protecting their gay employees. The list of achievements goes on and on. And, we're not done yet: All polling data show that public support for LGBT equality is not leveling off but accelerating.\n \n What makes this ongoing progress even more remarkable is that the LGBT-rights movement has been outnumbered and outfunded at virtually every turn and in every arena, even in comparison to other progressive movements. Opponents of LGBT rights operate hundreds of radio stations, they run huge (and hugely influential) national advocacy organizations, and they are enmeshed in enormous faith communities and able to deliver their anti-equality message to millions every weekend.\n \n While opponents of LGBT rights have at least eight national advocacy organizations with budgets of more than $10 million, the LGBT movement has just one. In fact, the annual budget of just one of the biggest opponents of LGBT rights, Focus on the Family/CitizenLink, is greater than the budgets of the 39 largest LGBT advocacy, legal and research organizations, combined. \n",
