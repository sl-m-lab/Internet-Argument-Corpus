Well, the terrorist striking us part was quickly dispelled. So I was against the war.\n \n Then of course the reason shifted to Iraqi Freedom, which I believe is the worst reason. Now, icing on the cake, the administration admits that Iraq did not have these stockpiles let alone have capability for WMD. We still might find chemicals that if mixed together could be poisonous, but we were all misled according to Rice, period.",
