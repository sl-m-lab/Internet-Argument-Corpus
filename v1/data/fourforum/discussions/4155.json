   "A varve is pair of layers, usually one dark and one light, found at the bottom of still water lakes. The causes for the formation of these pairs of layers is understood. Summer melting and runoff and/or algae bloom is responsible for the dark, coarse layer where deposition is rapid. The finer, lighter layer is caused by the slow deposition of the settling of fine silt suspended in the water. There are lakes all over the world that exhibit this pattern of annual varves from many years in the past. They are still being deposited today.\n \n In the highlands of Central America there is such a lake. Cores from the lake bottom show in excess of 12,000 varves (24,000 strata). This observation alone would be enough to cast doubt on the idea of a global flood about 4,500 years ago. There is no indication of an interuption in this annual pattern and it continues to this day.\n \n However, there is one anomaly in the varves of this lake. About 11,000 years ago there is a layer of soot in one of the varves and all of the summer layers above that soot contain corn (maize) pollen. Corn does not grow wild. It requires cultivation by humans. If humans stopped planting corn, it would become extinct in a single year.\n \n The hypothesis is that humans burned off the vegitation to create fields to plant crops. Corn made up at least part of those crops.\n \n Creationists claim that a varve count is incorrect because sometimes more than one varve is laid down in a single year (it has never actually been observed). However, in the case of this lake, the varves show a crop cycle, planted once each year.\n \n By the way, the varves in core samples of Lake Suigetsu in Japan have been counted up to a count of about 45,000. These varves were then radiocarbon dated. The dates of the first 9,000 varves confirmed the previous calibration of radiocarbon dating methods derived from dendrochronology. Those below 9,000 have established a calibration for radiocarbon dating past that age. This supplies calibration for what is essentially the complete useful time period of radiocarbon dating.",

   "Yeah, there's wild maize and then there's domesticated corn.\n I'm guessing pandion means that the pollen was from domesticated corn,\n since wild maize obviously grows wild.\n \n There are other things that suggest an old earth like coral reefs, etc.\n There are also things that demonstrate civilization older than 6000 years.\n Pre-dynastic Egypt stretches back to at least 4004 BC (well beyond that) \n and there have been some really old chinese writings found, probably some of the earliest writing in the world.\n http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2956925.stm\n But, I guess the times of these writing are debatable.\n \n \n Here's a quick list of a few others.\n http://www.religioustolerance.org/oldearth.htm\n There's a 4700 year old tree!\n \n I really like this one:\n \n \nCreation scientists teach that the fossil remains of land animals that have been found trapped in the many rock layers were all actually alive at the time of Noah's flood. These few generations of animals all drowned. Some turned into fossils and were trapped in the layers of sedimentary rock which were laid down by the flood. Robert Schadewald computed that if all of the fossils of animals in the Karroo Formation in Africa had been alive at one time and evenly spaced around the entire land surface of earth, that there would be 21 animals (ranging in size from a small lizard to a cow) per acre. A very conservative estimate is that there are about 100 fossils elsewhere on earth for each fossil in the Karroo Formation. Thus, assuming that all of these animals were evenly distributed, there would have been over 2,100 living animals per acre of land - \"ranging from tiny shrews to immense dinosaurs\" when the flood hit. This is clearly impossible.\n",

It could be that the original article stated that the soot and pollen appeared at the same time and continued to the present. I was an undergraduate at the time I heard the story. I have looked for the book but seem to have lost in the intervening years. I would love to get my hands on it because it was a text on evolutionary biology.

   "The natural fission reaction is really interesting, I hadn't heard about it.\n\n I first heard about it some years ago when my son was studying nuclear engineering at Texas A&M. The topic was covered in an introductory freshman course and he used to come home and tell me about all the neat stuff he was learning. He also gave me his text books when he didn't need them any more. He did graduate and spent some time at the South Texas Project. (He also graduated from UT Law).\n \n The link that you gave didn't exist back then, although I am quite familiar with it now. I had to learn all of that stuff by reading books. But it was instructive to learn about the composition of uranium ore, enriched uranium fuel, and spent fuel. I also learned the concept of moderation, which is important to the Oklo reactors.\n \n Another fact is that any fission reaction, whether it is U-235 or Pu-239, in the presense of U-238 causes the formation of Pu-239. As I mentioned, most U.S. water moderated reactors use enriched uranium fuel. It is composed of mostly U-238 with just enough U-235 to form a critical mass. As the reaction progresses, some U-238 through neutron capture and an intermediate step becomes Pu-239. Pu-239 is also fissionable and, as I mentioned, about 1/3 of the power of a water moderated power reactor comes from the fission of plutonium that was created from U-238.\n \n Even when the fuel is no longer able to sustain a fission reaction, there will be some U-235, a lot of U-238, and several isotopes of plutonium (Pu-239 + n -< Pu-240 + n -< Pu-241 etc.) as well as many other fission products in known proportions. The Oklo reactors have all of the characteristics of spent fuel that is very old. There is no plutonium found in the ore at Oklo.\n \n The general understanding is that plutonium does not occur naturally. But Pu-244 has a huge half life and has actually been detected at Oklo. It is thought to be primordial rather than as a result of the reaction. And with improved methods of detection, Pu-239 has been detected in normal uranium ore. The amounts are quite small and are exactly what would be expected from neutron capture from the radio decay of uranium.\n \n The Oklo reactors cannot be explained by young earth creationists. Usually they avoid the questions entirely. Anyone with enough knowledge to understand the physics isn't a creationist. You have to change some universal constants to account for it, like the speed of light. But generally creationists don't care. They just ignore the question and continue to claim a young earth.",
