   "@Simone\n \n You are obviously ecstatic that Obama was elected. Why? Seriously. I have seen a lot of people who were absolutely thrilled that he was elected, but what do you think he is going to actually do for you...or what part of his policies do you find especially appealing?\n \n I will say up front that I did not vote. The only candidate that I found acceptable was Ron Paul, because I believed absolutely that whether we knew it or not, the only issue that really mattered in the election was the economy and he was literally the only candidate who was willing to discuss the issue frankly and openly (yes..the lunatic who kept saying our economy was about to collapse...). Frankly Obama and McSame both had terrible economic plans, and both lied about the state of things, and I was not interested in voting for either of them.\n \n So, what do you find appealing about him? For the most part his policies seem a little vague to me. He makes these broad, sweeping vision of the future (and I will admit I find many of those visions inspiring) but it seems like he does not really have a concrete plan to get us there. Some of the stuff he has done frankly is a step in the wrong direction. For example, why in the world would he appoint Geithner as treasury secretary? The guy is damn near Paulsons twin...the evil one. \n \n You obviously find the guy inspiring. What about him really inspires you??",
