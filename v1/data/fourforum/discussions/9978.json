   "The materialists/atheists in society have attempted to convince themselves and others that humans are the end result of a long string of randomness culled by a selection. Ultimately this means humans got here as lucky accidents and, contrary to what the Bible says, were not created with love from a Divne, supernatural Creator. This, of course, is based on the Neo-Darwinist premise that animals evolved by way of random physical changes. But what if physical changes aren't random?\n \n When I first started debating evolution I argued that getting a tan, for instance, was not a random biological change, and thus, evolution was falsified. The evolutionist reply, of course, was that getting a tan is not evolution because there was no inheritance of this tan on behalf of progeny. So I set out to dig up scientific examples of such inheritance. I knew these scientific experiments had to exist that tested the premise of animals passing on life's experiences to their offspring. To my shock, disgust and amazement there were none. Not even one. How could science not even test this? It would be so simple!\n \n Regardless if pigmentation can be directly passed on or not, It became clear that the Big science was hiding something; a terrible secret...the secret every biologist certainly knew but never dared mention: epigenetic inheritance of life's experiences was a reality.\n \n Richard Dawkins:\n \n \"I use the word \"scare\" because, to be painfully honest, I can think of few things that would more devastate my world view than a demonstrated need to return to the theory of evolution that is traditionally attributed to lamarck. It is one of the few contingencies for which I might offer to eat my hat.\" Richard Dawkins, The Extended Phenotype.\n \n oops....\n \n http://discovermagazine.com/2006/nov/cover/article_view?b_start:int=1&-C=\n \n \n To the surprise of scientists, many environmentally induced changes turn out to be heritable. When exposed to predators, Daphnia water fleas grow defensive spines (right). The effect can last for several generations.\n \n This brings a painful reality for materialists and evolutionists. Of course many deny this reality by saying it doesn't contradict Darwinism, however, it absolutely does for the following reasons:\n \n 1) It shows the non-physical creates the physical. (By non-physical, I don't care if this means \"of the mind,\" \"mental,\" \"spiritual,\" \"mystical,\" or whatever else. The point is that the physical is created and manipulated by a non-physical entity residing in each organism.)\n \n 2) It shows the non-physical codes the information in the DNA structure. (Everyone wondered where the information that resides in DNA comes from....now we know.)\n \n 3.) It shows that the non-physical is the unit of inheritance. It's these non-physical signals that code the genetic states that get passed on from generation to generation. This, of course, is blasphomy 101 for the evolutionist....but have you ever wondered why kids often come out looking and acting like their parents and grandparents? It's because they are simply the physical seed that's been encoded by their parent's non-physical mental, emotional and spiritual signals. \n \n 4) It shows there is no need for natural selection for new traits to spread throughout a population; that evolution happens horizontally before it happens vertically.\n \n 5) It shows a new or mutated gene is not necessary for the emergence and/or inheritance of new traits.\n \n 6) It shows the whole manipulates and controls its parts. Materialists say all evolution happens as a result of random alterations of genetic structure; that accidental changes in parts create new and different wholes....in reality it's the purposeful and intellectual processes of wholes that creates new and different parts. This flips everything about biology on its head -- including the fossil record; it turns a process that would take millions of years into a process that takes a blink of an eye.\n \n 7) It backs up The Bible and Genesis by showing humans - and every other animal -- got here not by way of millions of years of physical accidents, but instead, instantly, as a result of special creation by way of a non-physical, intellectual reality.",

   "And in Daphnia you might want to consder that the specifics are known to some degree as to what compound serves as a signal of predators.\n \n http://plankt.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/fbi142v1\n \n Just in case you are too lazy to read here is a bit of the article.\n \n Daphnia may respond with an array of antipredator defences (behavioral, morphological, life-history) to a chemical cue (kairomone) exuded by its predators: fish and Chaoborus. Given the wide array of potential responses, it is an interesting question whether antipredator defences are coupled or independent of each other. Since antipredator responses are costly and even possessing the genetic information to respond to a certain predator might involve a cost, clones may only react to predators they co-occur with in nature. In this study we provide evidence for an uncoupling of responses by Daphnia pulex in several antipredator defences against Chaoborus. We were unable to detect a correlation between behavioral (migration), morphological (neck-spine induction), and life-history (growth rate, neonate size and size at first reproduction) responses. Furthermore, antipredator responses did not always comply with what is commonly believed. We found that Daphnia clones can migrate up or down when exposed to fish or Chaoborus kairomone, and that population growth rate, neonate size and size at first reproduction can increase or decrease in response to Chaoborus kairomone. We also show patterns in antipredator defences that seem to relate to the habitat from which clones were derived. Daphnia clones that were collected in habitats with Chaoborus as the dominant predator tended to react strongly to Chaoborus kairomone by migrating upward and producing neckspines. The migration behaviour against fish kairomone in these clones was often an unexpected upward migration. The Daphnia clone that co-existed with fish predators showed a downward migration in the presence of fish as well as Chaoborus kairomone. Clones that had occurred with either both or no predators had mixed responses. We sometimes found an upward migration in combination with smaller body size as a response to Chaoborus kairomone. This may be interpreted as a behavioural defence against Chaoborus and a life-history defence against fish. Daphnia seem not to exhibit defence behaviour against predators they do not co-occur with. It might be costly for Daphnia to maintain genetic information to respond to these predators and protect that information from genetic drift.",

Evolution happens to be by far the best existing explanation for diversification of life. Genetics and epigenetics are the best explanations going for heritable variability. And given that we often know the mechanisms in considerable detail behind specific variations its not something that \"just happens\". The chemistry of mutations are well known for example. Many specific mutations are well described down to the point mutation of a specific base in a specific codon resulting in the change of a single amino acid at a known three dimensional location in the relevant protein. And sometimes we know in mechanistic terms how that small change alters the activity of the resultant protein - again with a resolution down to the atomic level and lower.",

Please note that the process is initially induced by the predator signal. It matters not where the signal arises from the predator or the prey. This system is not dissimilar to the concept of internal anitgen image proposed by Jerne for the human immune system in which a internally produced idiotype is selected by antigen exposure which is in effect a copy of prior antigen exposure history.

   "I suggest you actually read the article again. What's happening is the butterfly offspring are emerging according to season, background conditions or predators with specifiic wing variations. This has absolutely NOTHING to do with your beloved materialist darwinism, which says variation arises accidentally by way of mutation in a single, lucky individual. This is a purposeful, adaptive change by way of each individual in the population. Now how exactly is it that each developing organism first of all \"knows\" there are predators on the outside...second, how does he take this knowledge and transform it into a physical reality by altering his physiology?\n\n \n Nope you again misread the relevant material. Lets consider the authors intrepretation shall we - rather than relying on your own. Lets start at the beginning:\n Butterfly Wings Aid Study Of Morphological Evolution\n The beautiful patterns on butterfly wings are emerging as exceptional model systems that may reveal much about how the shapes, sizes and colors of specific organisms have evolved.\n \n This is a type of study called morphological evolution, according to the authors of the paper featured on the cover of the current (March 2002) issue of Trends in Ecology and Evolution.\n \n Did you notice the word evolution used mention of the term evolution four times in two sentences in the first two paragraphs?\n \n Next:\n In \"Development and evolution on the Wing,\" Antonia Monteiro, Ph.D., University at Buffalo assistant professor of biological sciences, and W. Owen McMillan and Durell Kapan of the University of Puerto Rico describe butterfly wing patterns as possibly the best animal system for understanding the developmental and genetic processes that produce morphological variation in nature.\n And perhaps you accidentally overlookd the title of the original work being reported. \"Development and evolution on the Wing\". \n \n Another paragraph states:\n \"Butterfly wing patterns are a very amenable system for studying morphological evolution because they develop on a two-dimensional, epidermal surface made up of tiny scales, each of which produces only one pigment,\" Monteiro explained. \"A single sheet of cells is not nearly as complex as a three-dimensional structure.\"\n \n \"Morphological Evolution\" -- Did you miss that term perhaps. Are your eyes functioning properly?\n \n The remainder of the article:\n \"On the other hand,\" she stressed, \"the striking variation of wing patterns of butterflies has a clear function in the wild.\"\n \n Monteiro noted that the differences in wing patterns differentiate one species of butterfly from another and are used by males and females to determine with which individuals to mate.\n \n They also have been shown to serve an adaptive purpose, as demonstrated by numerous studies focusing on seasonal changes in wing coloration of individuals in a species.\n \n For instance, Monteiro said, the darker wing patterns that show up in butterflies that emerge in the spring serve to warm up the butterfly faster, whereas butterflies that emerge in the summer have lighter colors.\n \n \"Also, many butterflies that emerge in the wet season in the tropics have large, conspicuous marks on their wings that deflect the attacks of predators while the butterflies are actively finding mates and laying eggs, while the dry-season cohorts are very cryptic, trying to blend in with their environment and not attract any attention from predators until the rains arrive again,\" she said.\n \n The authors note that what's not known about wing patterns in butterflies are the genetic mechanisms that result in the great variety of patterns that exist and an understanding of how those mechanisms have evolved through time.\n \n \"Evolution of these patterning mechanisms has enabled the ancestors of the generally drabber looking moths to also give rise to the butterfly lineages, where an explosion of pattern and color have occurred,\" Monteiro said.\n \n In an attempt to identify those mechanisms, Monteiro is working to create the world's first transgenic butterfly, one that she will breed in her lab to determine the particular genetic code that is responsible for the beautiful colors and patterns on butterfly wings.\n \n The researchers then will be able to test whether genes that seem to be involved in color pattern formation actually are important in directing the production of different pigments.\n \n \"A transgenic system is needed to test the causal involvement of genes that have already been shown through their suggestive expression patterns to be involved in color pattern formation,\" she said.\n \n \"Even more important, it will allow us to figure out the regulatory regions of these genes that are turning them 'on' in a particular spatial area on the wing. These will be, in my view, the prime candidate regions to look for variability in DNA sequences that correlates with variability in color pattern. My job is to find out what are the signals that tell each scale-cell on a butterfly wing to produce a particular pigment during development and to find out how those signals change across different species and through evolutionary time.\"\n \n Monteiro's research on the published work was funded by a grant from the Human Frontiers Science Program, an international organization based in France that supports basic research focused on complex mechanisms of living organisms. - By Ellen Goldbaum \n Please point out to the audience here just what you think is not due to ordinary genetically driven evolutionary processes here? You are aware of course that such traits are modulated by the environment? You are aware that the population of a species of butterflys inherits the capabilities which are exhibited? And you are aware that the phenotypic plasticity is due to genetic control mechanisms? But are you aware that this study is standard evolutionary doctrine? Apparently not. Conclusion - you are nearsighted to the point of blindness.",

This is so anti-darwinian it's not even funny.\n Its not a defense, its a description of how this particular system works! The original signal from the predator species triggers a defensive response in the Daphnia - the production of additional \"armor\". Subsequently those Daphnia secrete substances which continue to trigger that same response for the next several generations. The chemicals not only matter, they are all that matters! Its pretty obvious by the way that you do not ordinarly deal with signal processing systems or you would recognize the common logic type that this represents - namely a latch. Or even better if you consider the eventual return to \"normal\" after several generations of non-exposure - a pulse stretcher. \n \n Your description of whats happening is putting the cart before the horse. The predators presense triggers the response via various signal transduction effects. There is no \"purpose\" although there is an adaptive advantage. Again this fits the usual evolutionary concepts. Its an evolved capability. Purely explicable in terms of chemistry and physics.",

   "To the surprise of scientists, many environmentally induced changes turn out to be heritable. When exposed to predators, Daphnia water fleas grow defensive spines (right). The effect can last for several generations.\n \n This brings a painful reality for materialists and evolutionists. Of course many deny this reality by saying it doesn't contradict Darwinism, however, it absolutely does for the following reasons:\n \n 1) It shows the non-physical creates the physical. (By non-physical, I don't care if this means \"of the mind,\" \"mental,\" \"spiritual,\" \"mystical,\" or whatever else. The point is that the physical is created and manipulated by a non-physical entity residing in each organism.)\n\n I can't believe it!\n You believe that the page you cited said anything along those lines?! emoticon_xdonno\n It was talking about epigenetics, not the non-physical \"entity\" you somehow came up with.\n \n2) It shows the non-physical codes the information in the DNA structure. (Everyone wondered where the information that resides in DNA comes from....now we know.)\n\n Obviously, you don't realize that epigenetic inheritance is a chemical (i.e., physical) process.\n I still can't believe it.\n \n3.) It shows that the non-physical is the unit of inheritance. It's these non-physical signals that code the genetic states that get passed on from generation to generation. This, of course, is blasphomy 101 for the evolutionist....but have you ever wondered why kids often come out looking and acting like their parents and grandparents? It's because they are simply the physical seed that's been encoded by their parent's non-physical mental, emotional and spiritual signals.\n\n Alternatively, it could be that they have a similar genome and a similar lifestyle...\n \n4) It shows there is no need for natural selection for new traits to spread throughout a population; that evolution happens horizontally before it happens vertically.\n\n Epigenetic inheritance does not create new genes. The \"information\" (as you like to call it) is simply expressed or not expressed according to the situation.\n \n5) It shows a new or mutated gene is not necessary for the emergence and/or inheritance of new traits.\n\n See above.\n \n6) It shows the whole manipulates and controls its parts. Materialists say all evolution happens as a result of random alterations of genetic structure; that accidental changes in parts create new and different wholes....in reality it's the purposeful and intellectual processes of wholes that creates new and different parts. This flips everything about biology on its head -- including the fossil record; it turns a process that would take millions of years into a process that takes a blink of an eye\n\n So tell me: how does the quote above indicate any of this?\n I still can't believe it. This post is the biggest collection of non sequiturs I've ever seen.\n \n7) It backs up The Bible and Genesis by showing humans - and every other animal -- got here not by way of millions of years of physical accidents, but instead, instantly, as a result of special creation by way of a non-physical, intellectual reality.\n\n :xbanghead\n This post also contains the single biggest non sequitur I've seen.",

   "Now as to the possibility of a man-made living cell - we may be closer than one thinks. We shall have to see if Craig Ventner et al can pull it off. They are already applying for a patent!\n \n ============================\n \n \n Second Life, or Not?\n \n By Jocelyn Kaiser\n ScienceNOW Daily News\n 7 June 2007\n An activist group is raising a ruckus about what it says may be the first effort to patent an entirely synthetic free-living organism. It says the patent application, filed by maverick genome sequencer Craig Venter's institute on an idea that has likely not yet been achieved, would tie up a new technology and could aid bioterrorists. But others say there's nothing new or surprising about the patenting effort.\n \n The work involves a simple bacterium called Mycoplasma genitalium that Venter's eponymous institute in Rockville, Maryland, has been tinkering with for years. An early goal was to determine the minimum number of genes for life, and in 1999, scientists there published a rough tally. Now, they want to synthesize this \"minimal genome\" from scratch, get it working inside a cell, then add genes that would enable the bug to crank out hydrogen or ethanol to produce cheap energy (Science, 14 February 2003, p. 1006). The Venter Institute describes this plan in a patent application filed last October and published on 31 May by the U.S. Patent Office.\n \n The ETC Group, a technology watchdog group based in Ottowa, Canada, is alarmed. They compare Venter's plans to patent a platform for building designer microbes to Microsoft's domination of personal computer software, suggesting that it's \"the start of a high-stakes commercial race to synthesize and privatize synthetic life forms.\" ETC is calling for Venter to withdraw the application and for the U.S. and international patent offices to reject it so that societal implications can be considered.\n \n But other synthetic biologists note that the U.S. Supreme Court long ago established that genetically modified organisms (GMOs) can be patented. The bigger question, says Harvard's George Church, is whether the inventors' claims to have come up with something useful will hold up. There's no obvious reason why you need a completely synthetic Mycoplasma rather than, say, modified E. coli to make hydrogen, he says. As for arguments that the technology could do harm, Frederick Blattner of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, notes that Mycoplasma only grows if it's coddled in a special broth. \"It would have absolutely no chance of survival if it escaped\" the lab, he says.\n \n ETC's Jim Thomas says his group's broader concern is that, as with previous GMOs, synthetic organisms raise questions that haven't yet been addressed. \"It's kind of the GMO debate on steroids,\" he says. Bioethicist Art Caplan of the University of Pennsylvania, who finds minimal genome work morally acceptable (Science, 10 December, 1999, p. 2087: ) agrees on one point--that some details of minimal-genome research that could aid terrorists probably shouldn't be published in the open literature.\n \n Venter's group still has to demonstrate the idea will work before they can get a patent. (Venter was traveling and not available for comment.)",

But these creatures have antennaes, gills, glands that emit poison, compound eyes, etc. Now you are going to have to give evidence that this is possible via mutation + selection ---- which has been the fairytale for decades.\n \n I think you should reconsider the appendages of worms. The segmented worms have numerous appendages associated with their segments (segments under the control of HOX genes one may add). Admitteldy earthworms are not loaded with appendages, but they are not the root of the tree so to speak. The originals are of marine origin (and of course, many of the examples you quote are also marine). Any critter with a segmented body appears to have the HOX system to control expression, and by moving the timing around various limbs etc can be produced. To understand limb evolution in land animals (ex insecta and other arthropods) you start with the fin structure of the bony fishes and modify them by mutation of the developmental program. This you can easily find on the net as its only recently become well understood.\n \n A laymans account of various worms may be of use in your education in this area. For example:\n \n http://www.mesa.edu.au/friends/seashores/worms.html\n \n Has some graphics, biological details etc and says in part\n Many marine worms belong to the segmented Annelids, which include the Oligochaetes such as the terrestrial earthworms, the marine Polychaetes such as Eunice aphroditois, and freshwater preferring Hirudinae such as the leeches.\n \n Polychaetes are particularly common on and in muddy and sandy shores. Their most obvious feature are the pairs of parapodia appendages. One pair comes from each body segment. These parapodia are used for crawling and swimming. \"Para\" means \"like\", and \"podia\", \"pod\" or \"ped\" means \"legs\". These parapodia are often tipped with hardened spine-like setae or dorsal cirri.\n \n In some species, such as the Bristle Worm, Eurythoe complanata, these cirri may break off into your fingers and cause a very painful sting. This is because the hollow cirri contain poison. Bristle Worms are also called Fireworms.\n \n Graphic of an Anelid worm's body parts\n \n \n ",

   "If you are going to say that these are merely gene expressions, you are going to have to show me how a change in environment will alter the expressions of these animals so that they change into a different animal. I would like scientific backup for that as well.\n If there is no gene expression then there is no organism. The environment does not alter genes. A species adapts to the environement over time via VSI. The mechanisms of mutation are many and you can find it in the literature. Animals do not change into different animals. Species split into additional species by evolutionary processes which do not include neo-Lamarkian processes to any measurable extent. Darwins work was after all \"Origin of the Species....\" NOT \"Transmorgification of Animals by Acquired Characteristics\". For example you can get a new flower species by minor modifications of the systems that control pollen/egg incompatibalities. Well documented. BUT an individual flower does not generally mutate to be a new species directly. Multiple genes are required. You can get a subspecies by a point mutation, but seldom is reproductive isolation due to a single gene. It takes multiple mutations in most cases, and multiple generations fo the specific diverging linage. Again its all out there in the lit for you to learn on your own. I recommend you study the geneus Nicotiania in particular as there is considerable data on its evolution at the species level. Enjoy.",

I don't mean duplications of already-existing body parts that result in a non-functional, defective character, such as an impotent set of duplicate wings on a fly.\n\n \n Okay. The new body begins as a duplication of an existent body part, ie the organism can live without it. This existing body part slowly turns into its own kind, serving a purpose. Example: The two intestines in a human, the multiple stomachs in a cow. Each secretes a different enzyme: without all of them, the organism dies.\n \n Example of how this comes up: Some years ago a person's amoeba test got infected with bacteria (what bacteria do to kill a eukaryote is attack the organelles inside the cell, as in they enter the cell). He separated the strong from the weak, knowing that if a weak cell died the strong ones were more suceptible (spelling) to death as well. Now the strong were in terrible shape, but they managed to live on, reproducing once a month (fifteen times less often than normal). But here's the thing...eventually the bacteria stopped attacking the daughter cells. They became integrated within the amoeba cells. Early on the bacteria could be removed and both organisms could live, but over time (fifteen years, equal to about 80,000 generations) the two became dependent on each other: when the bacteria were removed the amoeba and the bacteria would die.\n \n Google -< Amoeba Bacteria Symbiosis",

I don't mean duplications of already-existing body parts that result in a non-functional, defective character, such as an impotent set of duplicate wings on a fly.\n\n \n You say you are looking for scientific evidence, but would you ever accept a scientific answer if you got one? Somehow I don't think you would.\n \n Developmental and evolutionary biology has established that early arthropods and vertebrates arose from segmented worms. In vertebrates, there was a ventral-dorsal inversion such that the nerve cord became dorsal in vertebrates, and stayed ventral in arthropods. \n \n The simplest way of making a larger organism is simply to duplicate segments so that it becomes longer -- hence the many species of segmented worm we see today. In arthropods we still see examples of this repetitive duplication with animals such as the millipedes and centipedes. All that happens is that worm appendages on each segment originally used, say, for respiration acquire locomotory ability as well, and some eventually become specialised in locomotion. All segments can develop their own specialisations, and we now have a very good idea of how such development is controlled genetically.\n \n In the ur-arthropod, gene expression in most segments would have been the same. Genetic changes, however, ensured that in arthopods with specialised segments, each had its own pattern of gene expression. You cannot achieve such stable changes, which are not easily altered except by genetic manipulation or mimicking the effects of such manipulation, without altering the DNA such that the epigenetic control of expression is different in each segment. If there were no such DNA changes, it's hard to see how the differrences would occur.",

   "supersport\n \n BTW, when I say that arthropod genes have been reorganised as they evolved from simple segmented worms, to simple segmented arthropods, to complexly segmented arthropods, I am not just guessing. Many of the genetic differences have been discovered, and there is much research in the field to figure out why one set of arthropod genes gives rise to a multi-legged animal like a millipede, while another but related set give rise to a six-legged beastie like a fruit fly.\n \n None of these different species of arthropod have identical genomes, so it isn't just epigenetics that makes them different.

We can see this in humans too - a gene 'malfunction' (ie the gene did not come out right during conception) caused a person to have a brain with a single hemisphere rather than two. This would aid him in the humanized world as he can literally remember anything that happened as though it happened just a few minutes ago (he was on Ridley's \"Believe it or not\").
