I hate religion and readily admit that most of the horrors that have plagued history have been caused by religion. But most definitely not by the living God of Creation. Jesus never taught to kill His enemies, He taught to pray for them. \n \n So to answer your question directly and only from my personal perspective, I had no faith at all that God even exists when I first reached out into the spiritual darkness of this World seeking if absolute truth and perfect justice even existed or not. I was born a moslem so if anything, was raised in an anti-christian home. \n \n I am excellent proof that God responds to the heart which seeks His truth. Most people seek the belief system that supports their personally preferred way of thinking which is usually based on their personal comfort zones. I came into my faith as a clean slate with only an open heart, mind and soul as my guide. You see, I knew I didn't have the answers as to why I exist and sought those answers from the source of life in the hope that he even existed. My greatest fear when I prayed for God to reveal Himself to me was that I was talking to myself and God didn't exist at all.\n \n The result of my search for the eternal and absolute truth was meeting Jesus, the Jewish Messiah personally, something that should have been repugnant to me as an Arab, and accepting that He died for my sins meant I received the Holy Spirit of God which defines what being born again means. Because of what He did and His love for me I am completed as a born again child of God. This doesn't mean that I am now perfect in this flesh but that God in me is perfect and through Him I am seeking His perfection in my life.\n \n I repent daily for mistakes I make in life but do I ever doubt that what I have in Christ is real? Absolutely not!!! No matter what problems arise in this World of spiritual darkness I know that I am not alone, EVER. In that assurance is the greatest peace that can be found in the midst of the spiritual war zone we find ourselves in on Planet Earth.",
