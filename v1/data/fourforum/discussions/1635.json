   "There are 3 major and very obvious causes for the unemployment we are seeing; yet none of the politicians in Washington or the Dem. Pres. Candidates, except Dennis K., EVER mention these reasons as the cause. Instead, they blame the economy and unemployment on the failure of the Dot Com Startups, and Enron.\n \n THE 3 MAJOR CAUSES OF UNEMPLOYMENT ARE:\n \n 1) An unrestricted amount of work can be Outsourced to overseas firms that will complete the job at a much less expensive rate than can be done in the U.S.\n \n 2) An unrestricted amount of any business can be closed down for the purpose of relocating operations overseas using foreign low-wage workers.\n \n 3) Companies are permitted to hire Green Card and Foreign cheap labor, as an unrestricted percentage of their total base of employees.\n \n The laws enabling this transition protect businesses to continue to operate this way, and we will see U.S. Citizens continuing to experience job losses in GREATER NUMBERS than we have seen at the present time, as industry will always endeavor to pay labor the least amount it can, to perform the same work.\n \n We are now at 7% unemployed It's not much further till we have unemployment on the scale as it was during the Great Depression and a worse economy because of it.\n \n The politicians proposals for \"fixing\" the economy, such as Dean's plan to throw 200 billion into small business loans for 2 years does nothing but show his ignorance and everyone else's. \n \n Is this the price WE have to pay to get a Dem elected that will do nothing?",

   "1. Unemployment is at 5.8% and going down, not up.\n \n 2. 1 in 4 jobs in the US was created and exists because of trade.\n \n 3. Small business employs the majority of the population, not the big companies. Most small businesses sell directly to those big companies, thought, which is why most people seem to be unaware of this.\n \n 4. The Bureau of Labor Statistics found in the year 2010 there will be 10 million more jobs than people to fill them in the US. Not because that many will be created, but because so many people will retire.",
