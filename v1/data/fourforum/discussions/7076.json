   "I am sick of these damn protesters protesting president Bush's decision over Iraq. I am tired of the media and some political analysts trashing Bush. \n He went to war to defend this country. It is not out fault that terrorists came and bombed our tower in 1993, or crashed planes into our trade towers. Now, Bush is doing the right thing. My fourteen year old son's civics teacher says this war is wrong and a pullout should happen imediately.\n Now, if you disagree with this, please write me a response. But America is not just supposed to get attacked and go on with life. A military strike is needed. Do democrats just expect us to get attacked and forget? We are not going to. That is just showing them that they are winning.\n So, we attacked and invaded Iraq and Afghanistan. For the reason of defending ourselves and keeping national security safe.\n We took a taliban (kinda communist) regime away from the Afghans. Now, they can fly kites and shave their beards if they want. Iraq, we removed a rapist/murdering/tyrant that needed to be removed a long time ago. We made two countries a democracy and freed a bunch of people from tyranny and oppression.\n Now, you got people like Cindy Sheehan and others wanting a full blown pullout. Well, hmmm.\n Lets think about this. The following could happen.\n \n 1. Insurgents could try to overthrow the currently unstable country and make the country facist again.\n 2. A neighboring country could see this as the chance to make it part of their land.\n 3. The country would not be secure and safe and the innocent would endure tragic attacks like there is today.\n See, if we pulled out today, attacks might become more violent than they are now.\n Iraq is not safe yet for a pull out. Now, experts are predicting a pullout by mid or late 2006. It could, but I am guessing close to 2007. We still have yet to find the alleged WMD.\n Now, some think the WMD was a excuse for Bush to go to war, now, it wasn't. They used mustard gas, vxpoison gas, and other things against their own people and the Iranians in the Iran Iraq war.\n They more than likely have a stockpile of that stuff somewhere. Some predict it is being stored in Iran or Syria right now. But, who knows.\n So, if you agree the war was a right thing and that I am right about those sentences above, give me a hoorah.\n -John",

   "\n \n In this day and age, with so much hate, and oppression in the world, why is it so wrong to help out a country or two that are in need?\n \n An old American slogan goes \"Let Freedom Ring!\", why must we be too selfish to keep it for ourselves, and not let others feel and live in it too.\n \n Don't worry, luckily we still have some true Americans at heart that'll keep on fightin' the good fight. :)\n\n \n I am constantly stunned at this idea that we are somehow 'helping' the Iraqis and the Afghans.\n \n OK, I KNOW Saddam was a hideous man, as everyone has to say before they mention even a tiny criticism of what we're doing over there, it's just like after 9/11 when, before we criticised what the US was doing in Afghanistan, we always had to say \"I know 9/11 was an atrocity, but...\". It's kind of emasculating and I'm sick of it. \n In fact I'm sick of the whole argument. The whole idea that any war, along the lines of the way the US practices it, is going to help a country is just so OBVIOUSLY A LOAD OF BLINKERED XXXX IT IS UNBELIEVABLE.\n What I mean by \"the way the US practices it\" is the massive aerial bombardment which preceeds the invasion, which kills THOUSANDS OF CIVILIANS and ruins the country's infrastructure, as evidenced in Iraq. The only reason it was not so obvious in Afghanistan is that they have fewer large, densely populated areas and little infrastructure to begin with, as the result of 25 years of continuous war. Still, there are several reports of entire villages being wiped off the map by B52s...\n \n Back to my point: WHY in God's name do any of you think that any of the Iraqis are going to be grateful to us for bombing their country? Every bomb kills, maims, horribly injures dozens of men, women and children, destroys families, destroys lives, destroys what little hope remained in these poor oppressed people. \n It is madness to think that this \"liberation\" is going to create anything but resentment and sheer hatred at our total ignorance of the culture and history of this ancient land and our monumental arrogance in thinking that we are so morally superior as to be able to bestow our perfect rose-tinted world (which we so obviously posess) upon the poor little Arabs who can't manage it for themselves.\n \n I have just finished reading Robert Fisk's The Great War For Civilisation: The Conquest of the Middle East and I have to say if you want to understand why we can NEVER succeed in these ventures, this book is a must-read. \n For those of you who don't know him, Fisk is the UK's most respected Foreign Correspondent, and unarguably the world's greatest reporter on the Middle East, having lived in Beirut for much of his life, and having covered the interminable Afghan wars from their very beginning to the present, the Iran/Iraq war, both Gulf wars, the Israel/Palestine/Lebanon crises, to name only the most prominent events.\n His book brings home the magnitude of the problem we face. As well as being a remarkably informative history lesson, and as well as containing fascinating interviews with notable politicians and clerics, two things stand out about Fisk's reporting, and this goes for his regular columns as well:\n Firstly, he is utterly unflinching in describing the horror that goes with a military assault, he relates in graphic detail all those things that our networks won't show us because they are too \"disturbing\", those things that Al-Jazeera is condemned for showing. \n Secondly, most of his time is spent talking to ordinary people, to people just like you or me, who happen to live in Iraq, Afghanistan, wherever. Hearing their stories is a revalation. They don't care that we say we are there for noble reasons, why should they when they've just had their shop destroyed which was their only source of income, their parents are killed and their daughter is full of shrapnel?\n There is nothing much more I can say without lapsing further into opiniated rhetoric, but there is a passage from Fisk's book that I think illustrates my point perfectly:\n \n \n...The Americans say they don't intend to hurt children. And Doha Suheil[a 5 year old Iraqi girl] looks at me and the doctors for reassurance, as if she will awake from this nightmare and move her left leg and feel no more pain. So let's forget, for the moment, the cheap propaganda of the regime and the cocky moralising of Messrs Rumsfeld and Bush, and take a trip - this bright morning in March 2003 - around the Mustansariya College Hospital. For the reality of war - and here I unashamedly make my point again - is ultimately not about military victory and defeat, or the lies about 'coalition forces' which our 'embedded' journalists were already telling about an invasion involving only the Americans, the British and a handful of Australians. War, even when it has international legitimacy - which this war does not - is about suffering and death.\n Take 50-year-old Amel Hassan, a peasant woman with tattoos on her arms and legs, but who now lies on her hospital bed with massive purple bruises on her shoulders - they are now twice their original size. She was on her way to visit her daughter when the first American missiles hit Baghdad. \"I was just getting out of the taxi when there was a big explosion and I fell down and found my blood everywhere,\" she told me. \"It was on my arms, my legs , my chest.\" Amel Hassan still has multiple shrapnel wounds in her chest. Her five-year-old daughter Wahed lies in the bed next to her, whimpering with pain. She had climbed out of the taxi first and was almost at her aunt's front door when the explosion cut her down. Her feet are still bleeding, although the blood has clotted around her toes and is stanched by the bandages on her ankles and lower legs. Two boys are in the next room. Saad Selim is eleven, his brother Omar fourteen. Both have shrapnel wounds to their legs and chest.\n Isra Riad is in the third room with almost identical injuries, in her case shrapnel wounds to the legs, sustained when she ran in terror from her house into her garden as the blitz began. Imam Ali is 23 and has multiple shrapnel wounds in her abdomen and lower bowel. Najla Hussein Abbas srill tries to cover her head with a black scarf but she cannot hide the purple wounds to her legs. Multiple shrapnel wounds. After a while, 'multiple shrapnel wounds' sounds like a natural disease, which I suppose - amongst a people who have suffered more than 20 years of war - it is.\n - p 1161-2\n \n There are many other passages I could have quoted, some more grusome, more miserable than this one, hundreds of stories of lives destroyed, in Iraq, in Afghanistan, in Libya, in Lebanon, in Israel and Palestine, because of our politicians, our leaders.\n Read that passage again and tell me you are not moved by it. That could be any one of us, going in all innocence to visit a relative, cut down and maimed in an instant for a crime we are wholly innocent of.\n \n This is 'collateral damage'. This is 'liberation'. \n \n These are the kind of things that people remember, that fuel angry young men to fly planes into buildings. Pain and blood are not the foundations of friendship or peace or democracy.\n \n \"Fighting the good fight\"? Excuse me while I go and vomit somewhere.",

We want to seriously diminish the threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program.\" \n President Clinton, Feb. 17, 1998. \n \n \"[W]e urge you, after consulting with Congress, and consistent with the U.S. Constitution and laws, to take necessary actions (including, if appropriate, air and missile strikes on suspect Iraqi sites) to respond effectively to the threat posed by Iraq's refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs.\" \n Letter to President Clinton, signed by Sens. Carl Levin, Tom Daschle, John Kerry, and others Oct. 9, 1998 \n \n \"There is no doubt that ... Saddam Hussein has reinvigorated his weapons programs. Reports indicate that biological, chemical and nuclear programs continue apace and may be back to pre-Gulf War status. In addition, Saddam continues to redefine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer-range missiles that will threaten the United States and our allies.\" \n Letter to President Bush, Signed by Joe Lieberman (D-CT), John McCain (Rino-AZ) and others, Dec. 5, 2001 \n \n \"We begin with the common belief that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region. He has ignored the mandated of the United Nations and is building weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them.\" \n Sen. Carl Levin (D, MI), Sept. 19, 2002. \n \n \"Iraq's search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as Saddam is in power.\" \n Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002. \n \n \"I will be voting to give the President of the United States the authority to use force-- if necessary-- to disarm Saddam Hussein because I b elieve that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security.\" \n Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Oct. 9, 2002. \n \n \"There is unmistakable evidence that Saddam Hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years ... We also should remember we have always underestimated the progress Saddam has made in development of weapons of mass destruction.\" \n Sen. Jay Rockerfeller (D, WV), Oct 10, 2002. \n \n \"In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weap ons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including al Qaeda members ... It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons.\" \n Sen. Hillary Clinton (D, NY), Oct 10, 2002. \n \n \"[W]ithout question, we need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal, murderous dictator, leading an oppressive regime ... He presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation ... And now he is miscalculating America's response to his contin ued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction ... So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real ...\" \n Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Jan. 23. 2003.",

   "In the National Intelligence Estimate of 2002, where the all of the fifteen agencies involved in gathering intel for the US offered their collective views on the WMDs, a conclusion stated with :high confidence\" was that \"Iraq is continuing and in some areas expanding its chemical, biological, nuclear, and missile programs contrary to UN resolution\". The intel agencies of Britain, Germany, Russia, China, Israel, and France all agreed with this.\n \n In other words, the majority of the intelligence agencies agreed that saddam definitely had chemical and biological weapons.\n \n Some people say that Bush manipulated the CIA into telling him what he wanted to hear.

Administration chose to rely on self-serving Iraqi expatriates and their own interpretations of intelligence reports. It has been established that administration chose WMDs as a theme they could all agree on that would motivate the public and congress into a false sense of patriotism to support invasion and occupation of Iraq, who would welcome our presence with open arms. We (US) made a disastrous blunder based on deception and now we're paying for it. That same deceptive administration has now admitted to breaking US law and stated its intent to continue doing so.

   "The fact of the matter is that Saddam was slowly growing in power, and in doing so it was killing too many civilians.\n \n What exactly does this mean, \"growing in power\"? True, the sanctions regime allowed him to massively consolidate his power within Iraq but after the first Gulf War there is no way he was going to try to extend some kind of Iraqi empire. Saddam only invaded Kuwait because he thought that he was the West's favourite ME client, after all we supported him against Iran for eight years, but then we showed him that no-one's allowed to invade anyone without our say-so.\n \nSaddam was today's Hitler. We had to stop him before he got out of control.Saddam invaded other countries, Hitler invaded other countries\n\n Like I said, Saddam wasn't going anywhere except increasing his stranglehold on Iraq. Look at the countries he borders: Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Kuwait are all US client states, so he knew what the penalty for invading them would be, Iran is just too big and didn't work even when he had our support, let alone doing it on his own. The only candidate would be Syria, and there has been nothing ever suggested that Saddam was considering military action against Syria. \n The line \"Saddam was today's Hitler\" is a completely meaningless comparison and is just parroted by war lovers because it sounds melodramatic and harks back to the myth of WWII being a \"noble\" war. Hitler had an enormously powerful war machine and a strong economy based on that war machine, had allies in various countries including appeasers in the UK and US who thought we should just let him get on with it, and had a huge popular following due to years of ideological indoctrination which gave his soldiers the fanaticism needed to conquer mainland Europe in just over a year.\n Saddam, however, had a tyrant's vicelike grip on a country devastated by more than a decade of war followed by a decade of sanctions, in which the vast majority of people lived in poverty while he and his cronies reaped what little could be had from the sanctions regime.\n \nSaddam killed innocent people for no other reason, Hitler killed innocent people for no other reason. Saddam looked for bigger war machines, Hitler looked for bigger war machines. They are kind of the same person, except now, we put and end to it before he got any bigger. \n\n Saddam killed innocent people to keep the population too terrified to do anything about him. Hitler didn't need to do this as he had massive popular support, and killed innocent people as part of a racial supremacist ideological campaign of \"purification\". Hitler looked for bigger war machines because he actually wanted Germany to rule the world, Saddam (although there is no evidence he actually got any) looked for bigger war machines for the same reason every other poor country in the world does, to try and defend themselves against the powerful countries.\n \n \nAlso I would like to point out this is America, We don't need the rest of the world's approval when it comes to ending a tyrant, after all we were the first to say, hey that ain't right. The great thing is we will still keep on doing that exact thing too, so get used to it.\n\n \n You also (I should say \"we\" actually because the UK is complicit in many US foreign policy atrocities) don't need anyone's approval when supporting and funding mass murdering dictators like Pinochet (Chile), Somoza (Nicauragua), Suharto (Indonesia), Saddam himself during the 80s, and other oppressive regimes such as Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan during the 80s, and the present day Central Asian states such as Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan who are ruled by people easily comparable to Saddam. \n And as for being the first to say \"Hey that ain't right\", this just displays such blinkered arrogance and a lack of understanding of anything to do with realistic history I don't know what to say.",
