   "The question is:\n \n In the Bible and the Koran, God is always referred to as Him or He (except in the first of Genesis where God is referred to as \"We\" and \"Our\"). God is always given Father-like attributes.\n \n Why would God require a gender? If God does require a gender and that gender is male, then where is Mrs. God? I mean, why have a male with no female? The whole point of being male and female is for reproduction, but does God reproduce? Well, \"He\" had a son, supposedly (but that's only in one religion), and was it through sex (which requires male and female)? No.\n \n Some would argue that Adam was male and that he was made in the likeness of God. Again, the question arises, why? Why was he male? Then, Eve was made from Adam, because without male and female, there would be no sexual reproduction (which wasn't supposed to happen anyway before they ate the fruit, sexual reproduction is supposedly a result of being \"fallen from grace\".)\n \n So, why is God male? Does he have a penis? Does he make sperm? Can he grow a beard? Is he good with tools? Does he like NASCAR?",

This means principally that he approves of those who do good and accordingly disapproves of those who do evil. In every case where the expression occurs in the Qur'an it can easily be translated \"approves of\" instead of \"loves\" without any change in the meaning of the expression at all. The knowledge and realisation of this approval will also only be known at the Last Day. This is virtually all that the Qur'an says about the love of God towards mankind.\"\n http://www.answering-islam.org/Gilchrist/love.html\n \n Muslims deny the tirune nature of God\n http://www.answering-islam.org/Trinity/beckwith.html\n \n Further, their notion of their god is one being which is vindictive\n And (the unbelievers) schemed and planned, and Allah schemed also, and the best of schemers is Allah. S. 3:54 \n \n Remember how the unbelievers schemed against thee, to keep thee in bonds, or to slay thee, or get thee out (of thy home). They scheme and plot, but the best of schemers is Allah. S. 8:30\n \n In fact the Quran furnishes plenty of examples on some of the methods Allah adopts in devising evil: \n \n Remember in thy dream Allah showed them as a few: if he had showed them to thee as many, ye would surely have been discouraged, and ye would surely have disputed in your decision: but Allah saved you: for He knoweth well the (secrets) of (all) hearts. S. 8:43 \n \n Allah is said to have shown the opposing fighting forces as few to Muhammad since if he had shown them as they actually were, the Muslims would have been afraid to fight. Hence, Allah had to use deception in order to encourage the Muslims to fight in his cause. \n \n And when We desire to destroy a city, We command its men who live at ease, and they commit ungodliness therein, then the Word is realized against it, and We destroy it utterly. S. 17:16 \n \n Allah commands men to sin in order to destroy them completely. \n \n They (Jinns- demon spirits) worked for him (Solomon) as he desired ... then when We decreed death upon him, nothing showed them his death except a little creeping creature of the earth, which gnawed away at his staff. And when he fell the Jinns saw clearly how, if they had known the unseen, they would not have continued in the humiliating penalty (of work). S. 34:13-14 \n \n Allah deceived the Jinns into working for Solomon by preventing the latter's death from being disclosed to them, otherwise they would have stopped their work. \n \n Allah also deceived both Christians and Jews into thinking that Jesus was crucified when in fact \"it was so made to appear unto them\", seeing that he never was crucified or killed. S. 4:157 \n \n According to S. 9:51, nothing befalls Muslims except what Allah has ordained. And in S. 14:4, we are told, \n \n \"Allah leads astray whomsoever He will and guides whomsoever he will.\" \n \n And, \n \n \"Whomsoever Allah guides, he is the one who follows the right way; and whomsoever He causes to err, these are the losers. And certainly We have created for hell many of the jinn and the men; ... Whomsoever Allah causes to err, there is no guide for him; and He leaves them alone in their inordinacy, blindly wandering on.\" S. 7:178-179, 186 \n \n \"If thy Lord had so willed, He could have made mankind one People: but they will not cease to differ. Except those on whom thy Lord hath bestowed His Mercy: and for this did He create them: and the Word of thy Lord shall be fulfilled: ?I will fill Hell with Jinns and men all together.?\" S. 11:118-119 \n \n Not only does Allah guide people astray, but also has created men specifically for hell. To make matters worse, he even ordains the evil one commits as we have already seen in S. 17:16 and further clarified by this Muslim tradition: \n \n Abu Huraira reported Allah's Apostle as saying: \n \n Verily Allah has fixed the very portion of adultery which a man will indulge in, and which he of necessity must commit (or there would be no escape from it).\" Sahih Muslim #6421, 6422 \n \n To even imagine that Allah causes adultery is not only horrendous but disqualifies him from being the God of Moses.\n http://www.answering-islam.org/Shamoun/god.htm",

Does that mean the word of god was inadequate? I realize they MOSTLY mean the soceital norms of the day, but reading the cited passage says that Jesus thought parts of the scripture were inadequate. \"Eye for an eye?\" No! turn the other cheek. The word of God needed revision. \n \n Also, the Matt. passage to me sounds ridiculous. Did Jesus really say these things?\n \n Matt. 5: 27-You have heard that it was said, 'Do not commit adultery.'[5] 28-But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart. 29-If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. 30And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away.

   "Ok, sorry! They do give their stance on the matter. Further down the page they do explain it in terms of procreation and our human metaphors. This passage makes no sense to me and seems quite a stretch for an explanation. I sincerely think its an ecsape from the reality that the Bible is written by MEN in a time when MEN ruled (still do, btw).\n \n Quoting: http://www.catholic.net/rcc/Periodicals/Faith/Jul-Aug99/God2.html\n \"Can we make a similar jump from the occasional metaphorical likening of God to human mothers in Scripture to an analogical way of calling God Mother? No, and here is why: A mother is not the \"principle\" or \"source\" of procreation the way a father is. She is a receptive, active collaborator in procreation, to be sure. But she is not the active initiator-that is the father's role as a man in impregnating her. A father can be an analogue for the Creator who creates out of nothing insofar as fathers-while not procreating out of nothing-nevertheless are the \"source\" or \"principle\" of procreation as initiators, as God is the source of creation. But a mother, being the impregnated rather than the impregnator, is analogous neither to God as Creator from nothing, nor God as the initiating \"source\" or \"principle\" of creation. As a mother, she can be likened to God only in metaphorical ways-as nurturing, caring, etc., as we see in Scripture.\n \n One reason, then, Scripture more often speaks of God as Father than likens Him to a mother is that fatherhood can be used analogously of God, while motherhood can only be a metaphor. We can speak of God either metaphorically or analogously as Father, but we can speak of Him as maternal only metaphorically. Thus, we should expect that masculine and specifically paternal language would generally \"trump\" feminine and specifically maternal language for God in Scripture. For an analogy tells us how God truly is, not merely what He is like, as in metaphor.\"\n \n This is just totally absurd to me. Why is GOD given ANY human characteristics? Just so we can understand? But that's not what this is saying. It's saying that you MUST give god analogous human characteristics if you are going to speak about god.",

Perhaps you missed that in your zeal to post something flippant.\n \n Other scripture support:\n \n Matthew 5:16\n Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\n \n Luke 23:34\n Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.\n \n I Corinthians 8:6\n But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.\n \n Luke 11:2\n And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Gather which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth.\n \n John 16:32\n Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.\n \n John 14:6\n Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\n \n 1 John 3\n 1 How great is the love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are! The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him\n \n Malachi 1\n Blemished Sacrifices \n 6 \"A son honours his father, and a servant his master. If I am a father, where is the honour due me? If I am a master, where is the respect due me?\" says the LORD Almighty. \"It is you, O priests, who show contempt for my name. \n \"But you ask, 'How have we shown contempt for your name?'\n \n Isaiah 63\n 16 But you are our Father, \n though Abraham does not know us \n or Israel acknowledge us; \n you, O LORD , are our Father, \n our Redeemer from of old is your name.\n \n Isaiah 64\n 8 Yet, O LORD , you are our Father. \n We are the clay, you are the potter; \n we are all the work of your hand.\n \n Psalm 2\n 7 I will proclaim the decree of the LORD : \n He said to me, \"You are my Son ; \n today I have become your Father.\n \n \" Father: A distinctive New Testament revelation is that through faith in Christ, God becomes our personal Father. Father is used of God in the Old Testament only 15 times while it is used of God 245 times in the New Testament. As a name of God, it stresses God?s loving care, provision, discipline, and the way we are to address God in prayer (Matt. 7:11; Jam. 1:17; Heb. 12:5-11; John 15:16; 16:23; Eph. 2:18; 3:15; 1 Thess. 3:11).\"\n http://www.bible.org/docs/theology/proper/names.htm\n \n \nI think you mean that we call him Father and Him because that's the way it was written in the Bible? And the Bible is the word of God? And not the word of man (who at the time and place of Bible writing was very patriarchal). How do I reconcile the knowledge that the society of the time frame within which the Bible was written was VERY patriarchal indeed with the fact that the God of the Bible (and Koran) is referred to as a male? \n\n \n I don't believe you'll find the god of the Koran is male. Unless you present some supporting Suras. But I would be surprised indeed as most Muslims maintain that if you can possible form an image of their god, you'd be wrong because their god is beyond our imagination.\n \n As to the Bible, yes it is the inspired word of God, and God calls Himself many things, including \"I Am\". And \"Father\", see the prayer of His Son, Jesus \"Our Father...\"\n \n \nDo you think that if the Bible were written in more modern and, dare I say progressive, times that it would not read \"God the Father\" but \"God the parent\"?\n\n \n This is a hypothetical that is totally meaningless to me. The Bible is how it is. As to 'parent' it now has connotations specific to its time, so one might just as well say, in another 2,000 years, might God have used yet another different word.\n \n \nThe website you cite, for me, talks all about it but doesn't really clarify anything or state any kind of real opinion on the matter, except to support what I just said about the norms of the day. But one part was really interesting to me:\n \n \" He [Jesus] certainly felt free to correct inadequate ideas from the Old Testament in other respects (see, for example, Matt. 5:21-48) and to contravene religio-cultural norms, especially regarding women.\"\n \n So there were inadequacies in the Old Testament? Does that mean the word of god was inadequate? I realize they MOSTLY mean the societal norms of the day, but reading the cited passage says that Jesus thought parts of the scripture were inadequate. \"Eye for an eye?\" No! turn the other cheek. The word of God needed revision. \n\n \n When you raise a child, as that child progresses, the answers to life's questions get deeper and more meaningful (and eventually you might be able to talk as adult to adult). Likewise we are the children of God who fell from Him through sin. God has been patient with us in brining us back to Him. He has sent prophets to prepare the way, then His Son, Jesus Christ. Jesus finally brought with Him the fullness of the message of God.\n \n \nAlso, the Matt. passage to me sounds ridiculous. Did Jesus really say these things?\n \n Matt. 5: 27-You have heard that it was said, 'Do not commit adultery.'[5] 28-But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart. 29-If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. 30And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell.\n \n Is he saying that your physical body will be in hell?\n\n \n I believe Jesus said these things. There are sins we commit in our own hearts. Tell me, if you plan to kill someone have you sinned only when you kill the person, or from the moment you first committed yourself to do that act? I don't know what this has to do with the topic of this thread though.",

You show a few quotes where maternal analogies are used.\n \n 12 For this is what the LORD says: \n \"I will extend peace to her like a river, and the wealth of nations like a flooding stream; you will nurse and be carried on her arm and dandled on her knees.\n 13 As a mother comforts her child, so will I comfort you; and you will be comforted over Jerusalem.\"\n \n Like a mother comforts a child in her arms, I too can do this. However, the 'female' in this is not God, but Jerusalem.\n \n It says\n Isaiah 66\n 6 Hear that uproar from the city, hear that noise from the temple! \n It is the sound of the LORD repaying his enemies all they deserve. \n \n 7 \"Before she goes into labor, she gives birth; before the pains come upon her, she delivers a son. \n 8 Who has ever heard of such a thing? Who has ever seen such things? \n Can a country be born in a day or a nation be brought forth in a moment? \n Yet no sooner is Zion in labor than she gives birth to her children. \n 9 Do I bring to the moment of birth and not give delivery?\" says the LORD . \n \"Do I close up the womb when I bring to delivery?\" says your God. \n 10 \"Rejoice with Jerusalem and be glad for her, all you who love her; \n rejoice greatly with her, all you who mourn over her. \n 11 For you will nurse and be satisfied at her comforting breasts; \n you will drink deeply and delight in her overflowing abundance\n \n Did you have a point anyway, Mizmaxx?\n \n I have no problems really, with your argument if we call God what He calls Himself. I stated that God is not of a gender, but reveals Himself to us. Instead you are trying to suggest that He is a she by using quotes such as...\n \n Psalm 90:2\n Before the mountains were born or you brought forth the earth and the world, from everlasting to everlasting you are God.\n \n How does this make God a mother? It just says that before the mountains came into being God exists. Just as if I stated 'before you were born, I lived'.\n \n Exodus\n 14 God said to Moses, \"I am who I am . [2] This is what you are to say to the Israelites: 'I AM has sent me to you.' \" \n 15 God also said to Moses, \"Say to the Israelites, 'The LORD , [3] the God of your fathers-the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob-has sent me to you.' This is my name forever, the name by which I am to be remembered from generation to generation.\n \n You obvously have waded into these posts without reading them, because I have stated that this is why God has no gender. However, we need to refer to Him using feeble minds that all humans have. God has addressed Himself to us, and sometimes He refers to Himself as \"I am\", but other times to show His relationship to us He is referred to as a Father.",

Balls in your court.\n \n Jesus stated this. \"Our Father who art in heaven...\" etc.\n \n \n \n Appendix - guide to translation...\n \n A. Gender-related renderings of Biblical language which we affirm:\n \n 1. The generic use of ?he, him, his, himself? should be employed to translate generic 3rd person masculine singular pronouns in Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek. However, substantival participles such as ho pisteuon can often be rendered in inclusive ways, such as ?the one who believes? rather than ?he who believes.?\n \n 2. Person and number should be retained in translation so that singulars are not changed to plurals and third person statements are not changed to second or first person statements, with only rare exceptions required in unusual cases.\n \n 3. ?Man? should ordinarily be used to designate the human race, for example in Genesis 1:26-27; 5:2; Ezekiel 29:11; and John 2:25.\n \n 4. Hebrew \u00d0sh should ordinarily be translated ?man? and ?men,? and Greek an\u00c2r should almost always be so translated.\n \n 5. In many cases, anthr\u00dcpoi refers to people in general, and can be translated ?people? rather than ?men.? The singular anthr\u00dcpos should ordinarily be translated ?man? when it refers to a male human being.\n \n 6. Indefinite pronouns such as tis can be translated ?anyone? rather than ?any man.?\n \n 7. In many cases, pronouns such as oudeis can be translated ?no one? rather than ?no man.?\n \n 8. When pas is used as a substantive it can be translated with terms such as ?all people? or ?everyone.?\n \n 9. The phrase ?son of man? should ordinarily be preserved to retain intracanonical connections.\n \n 10. Masculine references to God should be retained.\n \n B. Gender-related renderings which we will generally avoid, though there may be unusual exceptions in certain contexts:\n \n 1. ?Brother? (adelphos) should not be changed to ?brother or sister?; however, the plural adelphoi can be translated ?brothers and sisters? where the context makes clear that the author is referring to both men and women.\n \n 2. ?Son? (huios, ben) should not be changed to ?child,? or ?sons? (huioi) to ?children? or ?sons and daughters.? (However, Hebrew ban\u00d0m often means ?children.?)\n \n 3. ?Father? (pat\u00c2r, ?ab) should not be changed to ?parent,? or ?fathers? to ?parents? or ?ancestors.?\n \n C. We understand these guidelines to be representative and not exhaustive, and that some details may need further refinement. \n \n \n \n Some examples you can check for yourself\n \n The following verses illustrate the guidelines for translation of gender-related language in Scripture. For Guideline A1 (first sentence): John 14:23; Rev. 3:20; (second sentence): John 3:18. A2: Psalm 1:2; 34:20; Gal. 6:7; James 5:14-15. A3: See guidelines for examples; also Psalm 90:3. A4: Hebrew: Psalm 1:1; Greek: Acts 20:30; 1 Cor. 13:11. A5 (first sentence): Matt. 12:36; (second sentence): 1 Cor. 15:21; 1 Tim. 2:5. A6: Matt. 16:24. A7: Gal. 3:11. A8: John 12:32. A9: Psalm 8:4; Dan. 7:13. A10: Matt. 6:9; John 3:16. B1: Matt. 18:15; Rom. 12:1. B2 (first sentence): Gal. 4:7; (second sentence): Exod. 19:6. B3: Gen. 48:21.

Hence when we read Hosea 10:1 it is a man who brings forth. You know God is often described as a \"Father\" but your theory is the opposite, so when scholars translate something into English, you go back to the Hebrew word which could indicate femaleness, but has not been so transcribed by said scholars that way.\n secondly, what's a Hebrew translation of St James (if that's what it is) got to do with either the context of the passage you cite, or, for that matter, St. James?

He has chosen who to reveal Himself to us. He has said \"I am\", and He has also described His relationship to us, as like a Father unto a child. Is this more of you not being anti-Christian? Telling Christians how to interpret our Bible? Funnily enough you argue that non-Natives should keep out of your sweats etc, because it's cultural appropriation, yet you don't mind being a cultural imperialist yourself, now do you?\n \n Again, you don't think this has anything to do with the Bible being written (primarily, let's say) by men? Who therefore described their God in their own image?\n\n No, I don't. I have repeatedly told you that God has revealed Himself to us - women included in the 'us'. I expect that if you keep asking the question and ignore the statement of belief I give you, you might just drive me away from this post.\n You here seem to deny the real spiritual force of women in Christianity. Many Christian women have had the same noetic knowledge of God as the Father. Mary, the most revered human (most revered by we Orthodox) was in touch with this.\n \n Some examples you can check for yourself \n\n \n Yes, yes, I know what the canon translation is- default male, even if incorrect.\n\n You are yet to show this. So far you've tried to suggest that 'baring' was an absolute with regards to women. I pointed out a verse that shows a man doing the bearing and you just say \"I doubt it\". Next you come up with a quote by someone saying the word can sometimes be used in reference to a female - well, we know God revealed Himself as a Father, so scholars likewise opt for using the male terminology - funny that they would do that!\n \nI'm asking you what you think.\n\n sigh.\n I repeat. God has revealed Himself to us and has shown that His relationship to us is like a Father unto His children.",

   "Greetings to All:\n \n At the risk of being chastised for being arrogant (as in the Bible Doctrine Forum), please allow me to take a shot at this question. If the answer to this was simple, then this thread would not exist. Also, we should be mindful of the fact that the Bible teaches a doctrine of generation (or regeneration) of the spiritual body; being born 'again' (anothen; #509 'from above'). Christ told Nicodemus, \"That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Do not be amazed that I said to you, 'You must be born again.'\" John 3:6+7. \n \n Holy Scripture also teaches that the 'natural man' does not accept the things of the spirit of God, while the regenerated man (he who is spiritual) assesses all things. 1Cor. 2:14+15. Those things being true, some among us will have the capacity to understand, while others will not. All that any of us really has is seeds, \". . . but God who causes the growth.\" 1Cor. 3:7.\n \n Thank you apathy for asking these questions:\n \n Apathy << What gender is God? The question is: In the Bible and the Koran, God is always referred to as Him or He (except in the first of Genesis where God is referred to as \"We\" and \"Our\"). God is always given Father-like attributes. Why would God require a gender? . . . So, why is God male?\n\n \n First off, it is physically impossible for creation to contain God. He is infinite, and creation is not. David writes of God Almighty, \"But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold, heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain You, how much less this house which I have built!\" 1Kings 8:27. We are living within a temporal creation governed by the limitations of time and space. Everything that has ever occurred inside this bubble of creation, and everything that shall happen, took place in the flash of a single instant to Him. All of these things take place within creation over billions and billions of years from our perspective. Therefore, if we could look beyond the veil of time and space to actually see God Almighty, then all we would see is His stare; as if God had His picture taken. It is through His \"His eternal power and divine nature\" (Rom. 1:20) that He can 'dwell in' His Three Witnesses. \n \n God of Genesis 1 is plural, because the Father (Spirit), Son (blood) and Holy Spirit (water) (from Matt. 28:19) were working in unison. The Three that bear witness, after all, \"are into the One\" (1John 5:8). \"For there are three that testify: the Spirit and the water and the blood; and the three are into the One.\" 1John 5:7+8. Take careful note that of Christ it is said, \"He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.\" Col. 1:15. He is the 'image' of God Almighty from outside of time and space in that all Three are present 'in' Christ. Christ said, \"Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me.\" John 11:14. And Scripture says, \"Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan . . .\" Luke 4:1. And lastly, Scripture says, \". . . that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself . . .\" 2Cor. 5:19. Our God that was in Christ reconciling creation to Himself is God Almighty from outside time and space. \n \n There is no such thing as male of female in the spirit. Nor do those human attributes exist 'in Christ.' As it is written, \"There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.\" Gal. 3:28. Christ says, \"For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.\" Matt. 22:30. \n \n The answers to these questions lie in the relationship of the Three Witnesses (Father, Son and Holy Spirit) of The Almighty who is beyond this realm of time, and how the principles that govern those relationships are depicted in the 'image' of everything else in creation. \"Then God said, \"Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness . . . God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.\" Gen. 1:26 +27. Note that Elohim is creating His 'sixth day' male and female with the command to, \"Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth . . .\" Gen. 1:28. Here we also see three witnesses of male (spirit), female (water), and their seed (blood). This is NOT Adam who was formed on the seventh day by \"YHVH Elohim' (the Lord God). The Lord of this Sabbath day (we are still in the seventh day) is our Lord Jesus Christ. \"For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.\" Matt. 12:8. He is the Lord God of the OT. \n \n To visualize this formula, draw two circles on a piece of paper that overlap. Note that two circles now make up three parts, and that the central part is 'begotten' from the joining of the other two. Label one side \"spirit,\" the other side \"water,\" and the central part \"blood.\" The best picture I can find is here: \n \n http://www.vb-helper.com/vbgp/ray_spheres1.jpg\n \n This triune relationship can be seen in the heavens (spirit), earth (water) and heaven (blood), in the temple/tabernacle with the Holy of Holies (spirit), Court (water) and Holy Place (blood); and within man himself in his spirit (spirit), body (water) and soul (blood). In each case, when the spirit and water witnesses are brought together, the third (blood; central part) witness is 'begotten,' by the overlapping of the other two. This is the seen in the case of Adam himself, when the breath of life (spirit) was joined with the dust of the ground (body; water), \"and man 'became' a living being (soul).\" Gen. 2:7. BTW, today we are born in the image of fallen Adam. The Lord God was able to take Eve out of Adam (with the seed), because he was formed with all three witnesses into the one. That form is what we aspire to in our 'incorruptible' (1Cor. 15:53) form. \"For this perishable must put on the imperishable, and this mortal must put on immortality.\" \n \n Christ is called the 'only begotten from the Father' (John 1:14), because He came to exist 'within time and space' from the joining of the Father (spirit sphere) and the Holy Spirit (water sphere); which correspond to His Sprit and His Body. So as a man is three (spirit, body and soul) and yet is one, God within creation is also Three (Father, Son and Holy Spirit) and yet is One God. Since the 'male' holds the position of the 'spirit' in the equation, then the personality of the Spirit side is that of a Father and masculine. \"God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.\" John 4:24. For all the above to be true, then God must represent Himself to us using the male gender. For Him to express Himself in any other way would be inconsistent with everything He teaches through His Word. \n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",
