   "It is all too common for sundry non-scientists and creationists of all stripes to try to argue against a technical science like genetics, evolutionary genetics, etc., by using oversimplified analogies.\n \n This is most likley because:\n \n 1. They lack the requisite knowledge to discuss the topic at a technical level\n 2. The simplistic analogies 'tell them' what they want to hear\n \n \n I wrote this elsewhere to point out the limitations and inapplicability of language analogies to technical issues of evolutionary genetics:\n \n *************\n \n When I taught intorductory biology, I used the language analogy. It is a good one - it takes what can be a pretty complicated topic and makes the basics more understandable.\n Note I wrote 'the basics.' I also made sure I mentioned that DNA is, in fact, NOT just like letters of the alphabet, genes are NOT really just like sentences, etc. I point out that the language analogy is just that - ana analogy. I would then go on to point out the limitations of the analogy in the hopes that my students would not do what Jlerollin has done.\n \n It is true that if we randomly alter the letters in a word it will most lilely render the word meaningless. It is also true that if we randomly alter words in a sentence it will likely render the sentence meaningless. It is true that if we write a sentence twice we will likely not alter the meaning of the sentence.\n \n Unfortuantely, genomes do not work exactly like the english language. And it is unfortunate that even the 'professional' IDcreationists do not seem to understand that - even Dembski and Meyer seem to think this is the case (that or they DO know better but want to rely on simplistic analogies to woo the uneducated).\n \n Example - Say we have a command sentence:\n \n Go to the store and buy 1 loaf of bread.\n \n Say I then stick some crazy punctuation ahead of the sentence, and that punctuation makes me interpret the sentence multiple times, so I go to the store and buy 1 loaf of bread a dozen times.\n \n Did I increase the information of the sentence? I suspect not, at least not by the usual standards that creationists trot out. But I certainly did alter the 'meaning' of it - for now instead of 1 loaf of bread I have a dozen.\n \n Now in the analogy, it might seem as though all we have done is buy a bunch of extra bread that we did not need - indeed, this also points out the limitations of analogies!\n \n But say that instead of a sentence, we were talking about a gene. And instead of some crazy new punctuation mark, we are talking about an insertion of a transposable element in the promoter region of the gene. And instead of buying multiple loaves of bread, we are talking about churning out millions of extra proteins.\n Did we increase the 'information'? Yes/no? And if no, why not?\n \n Further, say the extra protein being produced confers a benefit to the organisms.\n Did we increase the information now or not?\n If not, why not?\n \n And if not, how is the information argument relevant, if we can confer a benefit but not 'increase' the information according to standard definitions?\n \n ****************\n \n I received no answer thus far. I suspect I will not get on here, either. To provide a legitimate, scientific answer, one must understand the issues. Simple-minded language analogies and unwarranted extrapolations of oversimplified interpretations of thermodynamics abound, but none adequately address the shortcomings of the creationist position.",

While tutoring a student yesterday, I found myself trying hard to avoid the language analogy and finally somewhat giving in because it really is good for the basics. It's when the scientifically un-advanced take this analogy and run with it as if it is literal that we get the stupid creationist arguments.",

Lester, declared that computer programs can accumulate up to 30% 'random change', just like DNA (hypothetically) can, therefore, the computer analogy is a good one. But programmer R.
