   "Well, if she fancies going abroad (whether for the whole course or just a year out), hereare how the universities in the UK are ranked for physics. Is there a similar sort of thing (this is from the Times good University guide) for the US ones, it would suprise me if none of the newspapers did a annual book comparing them all?\n \n The important points to look for in the rankings are their research rating (as it gives a overall view on the quality of the staff and the course, as well as how up to date the facilities will be) as well as the quality of teaching. Once you are down to a shortlist, have a look at the staff pages on the various university websites and see what the course organisers main field of research is and whether its something you find interesting - things like this will heavily influence the various modules that comprise the course.\n Additionally, most of good guides will give a rating for graduate employment rates (the particularly good ones split this up by things directly related to the subject or further education and more general employment rates) and the drop out rates.\n Also its best to try to get these figures for the course rather than just the university (if they only have limited space a lot of guides just limit themselves to the university in general rather than looking at the particular courses even though teaching quality can vary wildly between them).",

   "I would not necessarily take the advice to rate schools on faculty research alone. Ballance this sort of thing in your esteem with class sizes. MIT has a great name and all, but in order to develop a young scientist needs personal mentoring which can be hard to find in schools where undergrad classes run into the hundreds. Realise that this attention is (sad to say) even harder for a female to get in the hard sciences, where an unconcious gender bias and the rampant egotism of elite young male scientists can drown her out. \n \n No one realy cares that much where a person gets their undergraduate degree in a field like physics. Graduate and post-graduate work is a necessity, each new phase representing an opportunity to \"trade up\" to a higher status school. Grades of course must be good, as well as GREs or whatever physics students take, but the most important element in getting into the right grad school is the quality and volume of undergraduate research work. Opportunities to do quality research are most numerous where many faculty members are actively doing research and CLASS SIZES ARE SMALL. \n \n Nobody expects a doctoral applicant to have experiance with the most rarified work in their field, so do not worry if the school that looks best does not own it's own particle accellerator; that sort of thing is best left for graduate studies.\n \n Take a look at highly rated Engineering schools, they are more numerous, can be cheaper, and require sizable physics faculties. Since I attend one now, I can verify that because of the high employabillity of BS engineers, such schools often have large out-placement offices which a physics student may take adventage of in finding internship /research assistantship positions. (I found some great stuff in psychology even though they specialise in placing engineers)\n \n All that said, OF COURSE you want to apply to MIT / Caltech / whatever... Just find some other more accessible gems to pad out the list.",
