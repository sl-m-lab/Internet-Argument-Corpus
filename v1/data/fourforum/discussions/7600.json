   "In four more years America will no longer exist as we know it. That is if George Bush and the multinational corporations of the United States, Canada, and Mexico succeed in their stealth project to put in place a new union of the three nations by 2010. \n \n The Council on Foreign Relations Task Force on Building a North American Community has been given the job of developing a plan for the economic and, eventual, political union of America, Canada, and Mexico. This union, the SPPNA [Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America], is a prelude to the FTAA, a demonstration model being constructed under the radar, without the knowledge or consent of the American people. It is in the process of being implemented now and the Bush team assigned this mission include: Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice, Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez, and Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff. [Documentation in websites listed below]\n \n If you support the continued existence of an independent and sovereign United States of America, then the report on Building a North American Community is not pleasant reading. One subject that pops up a number of times is open borders. According to the report, the borders that Americans have demanded Bush secure will be open in four years, with the President's blessing.\n \n The authors of the report \"...propose a community [North America] based on the principle affirmed in the March 2005 Joint Statement of the three leaders...\" [Bush, Fox, and Martin]. \"Its boundaries will be defined by a common external tariff and an outer security perimeter within which the movement of people, products, and capital will be legal, orderly, and safe. Its goal will be a safe, secure, just, and prosperous North America.\" http://www.cfr.org/publication/8121/building_a_north_american_community.html [pp.12.13]\n \n The report notes that the task force is guided by several principles, one of which is: \"Our economic focus should be on the creation of a common economic space [America, Canada, and Mexico] ...a space in which trade, capital, and people flow freely.\" Yes, open borders. [pp.15,16]\n \n Under the title, WHAT WE SHOULD DO BY 2010, the authors say: \"Lay the groundwork for the freer flow of people within North America. The three governments should commit themselves to the long-term goal of dramatically diminishing the need for the current intensity of the governments' physical control of cross-border traffic within North America. Also \"...the elimination of most controls over the temporary movement of these travelers within North America.\"[p.19]\n \n WHAT WE SHOULD DO NOW. \"Canada and the United States should expand programs for temporary labor migration from Mexico.\"\n \n \"Implement the Social Security Totalization Agreement negotiated between the United States and Mexico. According to the GAO, if this happens, millions of illegal aliens and their dependents in Mexico could be eligible for social security payments, courtesy of Uncle Sam [George Bush, if he signs the agreement]. That will certainly help keep social security solvent. [p.37]\n \n By 2010, the three nations \"should agree on streamlined immigration and labor mobility rules that enable citizens of all three countries to work elsewhere in North America with far fewer restrictions than immigrants from other countries.\" [p.37]\n \n \"Move to full labor mobility between Canada and the United States. \"...Canada and the United States should consider eliminating all remaining barriers to the ability of their citizens to live and work in the other country.\" It would give an advantage \"to employers in both countries by giving them rapid access to a larger pool of skilled labor.\" [p.37]\n \n \"The two countries should work to extend this policy to Mexico as well, though doing so will not be practical until wage differentials between Mexico and its two North American neighbors have diminished considerably.\" Guess who's wages will diminish considerably? [pp.37,38]\n \n Heard enough? George Bush has, until recently, remained silent on millions of illegals invading our country. And then all he did was push his guest worker [amnesty] program and give the problem to Michael Chertoff, who ignored it and also pushed the \"guest worker\" program. \n \n There is a contradiction here since Bush gave Chertoff a commendation in June of 2005 for his efforts toward implementing the new union of North America, which includes open borders. Bush obviously doesn't want to tell the American people the reason he refuses to secure the borders and the average American is cooperating by not having the time nor an interest in the workings of government. It's easier just to trust our leaders to do the right thing.\n \n However, \"Unthinking respect for authority is the greatest enemy of truth.\" The world is a dangerous place to live, not because of the people who are evil, but because of the people who don't do anything about it.\" Albert Einstein\n \n Sources:\n \n http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/06/print/20050627-2.html [Bush commends Chertoff, Rice, and Gutierrez for work on implementing the new union of North America]\n \n http://www.thesigintreport.com [see Politics, Illegal Immigration, Globalization]\n \n http://www.presidencia.gob.mx/en/activities/?contenido=17347&pagina=5 [President Vicente Fox announces a commitment to the SPPNA, North America, March 23,2005]\n \n http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/03/print/20050323-4.html [Bush announces a commitment to the SPPNA, North America]\n \n http://www.cfr.org/publication/8121/building_a_north_american_community.html [the organization chosen to develop a plan for the union of America, Canada, and Mexico by 2010,to be known as North America.

While by 2060 the US will not be in the position of sole super (or hyper if you prefer) power, I don't see us becoming the equivalent of Afgahnistan or whatever. \n \n As for how Australia is? I highly recomend it. I have an eye towards possibly moving back there within a few years.",

   "I doubt the US will become a third world country, barring some intense country wide disaster \n\n \n \n While the US won't become the \"equivalent of Afghanistan\", one defining feature of \"third world\" nations is that the vast majority of the people live in poverty with little or no access to mod cons or even basic services, while the ruling class minority live in luxury and own the country's entire infrastructure, shutting out the rest of the population, a socio-economic vicious circle.\n The US (and UK) are already going this way: Edward Wolff, Professor of Economics at New York University gives the following figures for wealth distribution in the US for 1998:\n \n The richest 1% own 38% of US wealth.\n \n The richest 5% own 59% of US wealth.\n \n The richest 20% own 83% of US wealth.\n \n The poorest 20% have \"basically zero wealth...have typically accumulated no savings\".\n \n The richest 10% of families own 85% of outstanding US stocks.\n \n The richest 10% of families own 85% of US financial securities.\n \n The richest 10% of families own 90% of US business assets.\n \n http://multinationalmonitor.org/mm2003/03may/may03interviewswolff.html\n \n He also says that this trend has been increasing, and increasing more sharply, \n ever since the 1970s. If the trend continues, and given the current admin's\n policies I can't see any way that wealth will be redistributed, the US will in fact become a third world economy.\n In reference to the \"intense country wide disaster\", apart from the fact that this insane wealth gap is a disaster in itself, there are the following to consider:\n \n 1) The Free Trade Area of the Americas will make the economic situation for the average american infinitely worse by forcing almost all workers to compete with a much larger amount of people who are used to working for much lower wages in Mexico and South America\n \n 2) The only people who will be relatively unaffected by this are those in the top percentiles who own everything, and will simply assimilate the vast influx of South American workers into their various businesses, happily pay them less than the US workers (but still more than the SAmericans used to), and thereby further increase the wealth gap\n \n 3) The US clearly no longer has the resources to deal with massive natural disasters. Faced with another Katrina (this could happen THIS YEAR) or the inevitable West Coast earthquake the US will be faced with a large refugee population who will place a massive strain on the economy which will already be damaged by said disaster\n \n 4) The FTAA will only be nominally run by national governments and will in fact be physically run by corporations: the current trend for low taxes, small government and massive defecit combined with the ever-increasing wealth of corporations will result in many corporations having a larger annual budget than the US government.",

   "Indeed.\n \n You don't need to be a conspiracy crank to see that we're heading for a world in which private, unelected global consortiums control nations in very direct ways to a larger extent than those nations' governments.\n \n This is already the case in many poor countries, where government policy is massively limited by companies with interests in those countries, who often have higher profits than those countries GDPs.\n \n It's also one reason that the political landscape has become so one-dimensional in many Western countries, because since the 80s and deregulation even our governments have had to follow the whims of the market to some extent, and any ideology a government might have had becomes lost in (often inept) economic pragmatism.\n \n If the FTAA goes ahead it will become a new model for society; the entire Western Hemisphere will be at the mercy of whichever conglomerates have the largest investments in it. If nothing is done about this, the worst case scenario will be a society where workers are traded and discarded like goods, there will be no social safety net, we will see gated communitites where the rich live with their own private transport network because nobody else will be able to afford to run a car or pay road tolls.\n \n If this sounds like far-fetched over-pessimism consider the fact that the people with real power are the people with the most money, multinational corporations.\n The government's only advantage is that is has the military. However modern government is made up of people from the world of business, especially in the US, where almost all Senators and Congressmen are extremely wealthy.\n Those in power obviously want to maintain the status quo. Those in business obviously want to maintain annual profit growth. The two go hand in hand. \n This is not a conspiracy, it is simply the natural course of action for those in power to further consolidate that power to the detriment of others.",

   "It surprises me that so few people have responded. This is probably the most important issue facing Americans at the moment, this forum is full of Americans, and yet judging by the deafening silence they either don't know what to think about the FTAA or don't want to think about it.\n \n I have genuine concerns about the plan, as it does seem to be the final stage of handing over power from government to business, and if it happens in the Americas, who's to say it won't then happen here in the EU?\n \n Why is there no debate about the FTAA? And why is there absolutely no mention of it in mainstream media except an occasional article letting people know that various stages have been implemented?",
