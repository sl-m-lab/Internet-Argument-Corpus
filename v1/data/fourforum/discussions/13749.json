   "Not in 2009, FBI crime report shows. \n FBI's latest crime report, for the first half of 2009, shows America is a less violent place even though ownership of guns has surged. Deterrent effect may have a role, but others see no correlation. \n \n The oft-cited credo that more guns equal more crime is being tested by facts on the ground this year: Even as gun ownership has surged in the US in the past year, violent crime, including murder and robbery, has dropped steeply.\n \n Add to that the fact that many experts had predicted higher crime rates as the US grinds through a difficult recession, and the discrepancy has advocates on both sides of the Second Amendment debate rushing to their ramparts.\n \n After several years of crime rates holding relatively steady, the FBI is reporting that violent crimes - including gun crimes - dropped dramatically in the first six months of 2009, with murder down 10 percent across the US as a whole.\n \n Concurrently, the FBI reports that gun sales - especially of assault-style rifles and handguns, two main targets of gun-control groups - are up at least 12 percent nationally since the election of President Obama, a dramatic run on guns prompted in part by so-far-unwarranted fears that Democrats in Congress and the White House will curtail gun rights and carve apart the Second Amendment.\n http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2009/1223/More-guns-equal-more-crime-Not-in-2009-FBI-crime-report-shows.\n \n Well there is a serious blow to the pro slavery side. More guns and less crime instead of what all the drooling dimwits at the Brady Bunch predicted repeatedly. I wonder what caused it? Certainly not gun free zones as we know how they work. ",

Given the fact that the criminals have already paid off the cops to bring in drugs, that is.\n \n   Weapons sell for just \u00a350 as suspects and victims grow ever younger \n Senior police officers have been warning for several months that a growing number of teenagers in big cities are becoming involved in gun crime. \n \n The age of victims and suspects has fallen over the past three years as the availability of firearms in some cities has risen. \n \n \"Illegal firearms have become increasingly accessible to younger offenders who appear more likely to use these firearms recklessly,\" a report on gun crime commissioned by the Home Office cautioned last year.\n\n England & Aust gun studies \n   Shotguns for \u00a350: study reveals weapons culture  \n Sawn-off shotguns are still the weapon of choice for the more serious armed criminal and can now be bought illegally for between \u00a350 and \u00a3200, according to Home Office research. A purpose-built 9mm handgun, which is easier to conceal than a shotgun, is available for \u00a31,000-\u00a31,400 on the back streets of Britain while those wanting \"a gangster image\" can buy a  machine gun  for \u00a3800.\n \n Even though those interviewed were in prison, many still viewed gun crime as a \"viable career option\" enabling them to overcome their deprived backgrounds to secure wealth and status. One man from Greater Manchester claimed he had earned \u00a352,000 in a week from gun crime. The study shows that though Nottingham is dubbed Britain's gun crime capital, guns are far more available in Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham and London.\n\n \n Here is another study produced by Australian Institute of Criminology (The Australian FBI) called   Weapons, drugs and crime Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC) \n \n And a article about the study here.\n Link  Australian Institute of Criminology study -- Tough new weapons laws 'miss hard core of criminal underworld' \nCANBERRA - The introduction of tough laws to control guns and knives appears to be failing to keep lethal weapons out of the hands of Australian criminals. .... reported that while new laws may have helped reduce the number of knives and guns in illicit circulation,  they have failed to deter hard-core criminals.

   "It does when the law says there are people who cannot buy and it's impossible to know who's who without a background check.\n\n \n Previously the government declared it had just cause to know about the marital activity of private citizens and what they did in their bedrooms at night. The Supreme Court ruled that they didn't.\n \n Simply because the government says that they have the right to know, doesn't mean they actually do.\n \n \nIt's not. It's meant to prevent felons from buying for themselves.\n\n \n And yet we have people like the Brady Campaign pointing to incidents of people with felony records being able to buy guns from gun stores. They're quick to blame the dealers for being corrupt and paint them as the problem. But considering the Nigerian was allowed to fly into this country, I think it has more to do with the government being lax in its duties.\n \n \nAnd if you're comfortable selling to whomever has the cash, your fellow citizens be damned. Swell.\n\n \n You know what, I'm tired of this game. In this post-9/11 world a lot of people are trying to push for the punishment of people who do wrongful acts, circumstances be damned. They don't care why they did it or what the reasons were, they just want blood.\n \n You can't prove that private sellers are knowingly and intentionally selling to a prohibited individual and in possession of mens rea. Therefore you can't prove that private sellers are the real problem, rather than just another victim in the chain of crimes.",
