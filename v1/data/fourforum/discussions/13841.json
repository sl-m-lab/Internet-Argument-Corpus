   "I only caught the last 20 minutes or so of the SOTU address but I can't stand the arrogance of the little b@#$%d! He talks about bipartisanship from one side of his mouth and badmouths Republicans from the other side. What a hypocrite. And he blasted the SCOTUS, something that was classless at best and intimidating at its worst over an isse that he has his facts wrong on. Foreigners have been excluded from contributing from campaigns and the SCOTUS ruling left those exclusions in place.\n It is also the audacity of arrogance for him to even attempt to defend campaign reform when he went back on his promise to McCain to accept public funding for his campaign when he realized that he could generate more money by rejecting public funding. He's a hypocrite of the worst kind! :xcensored",
