   "Crime up Down Under\n Since Australia's gun ban, armed robberies increase 45%\n \n By Jon E. Dougherty\n \u00a9 2000 WorldNetDaily.com \n \n Since Australia banned private ownership of most guns in 1996, crime has risen dramatically on that continent, prompting critics of U.S. gun control efforts to issue new warnings of what life in America could be like if Congress ever bans firearms. \n \n After Australian lawmakers passed widespread gun bans, owners were forced to surrender about 650,000 weapons, which were later slated for destruction, according to statistics from the Australian Sporting Shooters Association. \n \n The bans were not limited to so-called \"assault\" weapons or military-type firearms, but also to .22 rifles and shotguns. The effort cost the Australian government about $500 million, said association representative Keith Tidswell. \n \n Though lawmakers responsible for passing the ban promised a safer country, the nation's crime statistics tell a different story: \n \n Countrywide, homicides are up 3.2 percent; \n \n Assaults are up 8.6 percent; \n \n Amazingly, armed robberies have climbed nearly 45 percent; \n \n In the Australian state of Victoria, gun homicides have climbed 300 percent; \n \n In the 25 years before the gun bans, crime in Australia had been dropping steadily; \n \n There has been a reported \"dramatic increase\" in home burglaries and assaults on the elderly. \n \n At the time of the ban, which followed an April 29, 1996 shooting at a Port Arthur tourist spot by lone gunman Martin Bryant, the continent had an annual murder-by-firearm rate of about 1.8 per 100,000 persons, \"a safe society by any standards,\" said Tidswell. But such low rates of crime and rare shootings did not deter then-Prime Minister John Howard from calling for and supporting the weapons ban. \n Since the ban has been in effect, membership in the Australian Sporting Shooters Association has climbed to about 112,000 -- a 200 percent increase. \n \n Australian press accounts report that the half a million-plus figure of weapons turned in to authorities so far only represents a tiny fraction of the guns believed to be in the country. \n \n According to one report, in March 1997 the number of privately-held firearms in Australia numbered around 10 million. \"In the State of Queensland,\" for example, the report said only \"80,000 guns have been seized out of a total of approximately 3 million, a tiny fraction.\" \n \n And, said the report, 15 percent of the more than half a million guns collected came from licensed gun dealers. \n \n Moreover, a black market allegedly has developed in the country. The report said about 1 million Chinese-made semi-automatics, \"one type of gun specifically targeted by the new law,\" have been imported and sold throughout the country. \n \n Larry Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America, said the situation in Australia reminds him of Great Britain, where English lawmakers have passed similar restrictive gun control laws. \n \n \"In fact, when you brought up the subject of this interview, I didn't hear you clearly -- I thought you were talking about England, not Australia,\" Pratt told WorldNetDaily. \"It's hard to tell the difference between them.\" \n \n Pratt said officials in both countries can \"no longer control what the criminals do,\" because an armed society used to serve as a check on the power and influence of the criminal element. \n \n Worse, Pratt said he was \"offended by people who say, basically, that I don't have a right to defend myself or my family.\" Specifically, during debates with gun control advocates like members of Handgun Control, Inc. or similar organizations, Pratt said he routinely asks them if they're \"against self defense.\" \n \n Most often, he said, \"they don't say anything -- they just don't answer me. But occasionally I'll get one of them to admit it and say 'yes.'\" \n \n Pratt said, based on the examples of democracies that have enacted near-total bans on private firearm ownership, that the same thing could happen to Americans. His organization routinely researches and reports incidents that happen all over the country when private armed citizens successfully defend themselves against armed robbers or intruders, but \"liberals completely ignore this reality.\" \n \n Pratt, who said was scheduled to appear in a televised discussion later in the day about a shooting incident between two first graders in Michigan on Tuesday, said he was in favor of allowing teachers to carry weapons to protect themselves and their students on campus. \n \n Pratt pointed to the example of a Pearl, Mississippi teacher who, in 1997, armed with his own handgun, was able to blunt the killing spree of Luke Woodham. \n \n \"By making schools and even entire communities 'gun free zones,' you're basically telling the criminal element that you're unarmed and extremely vulnerable,\" Pratt said. \n \n Pratt also warned against falling into the gun registration trap. \n \n \"Governments will ask you to trust them to allow gun registration, then use those registration lists to later confiscate the firearms,\" he said. \"It's happened countless times throughout history.\" \n \n Sarah Brady, head of Handgun Control, Inc., issued a statement calling on lawmakers in Michigan and in Washington to pass more restrictive gun access laws. \n \n \"This horrible tragedy should send a clear message to lawmakers in Michigan and around the country: they should quickly pass child access prevention or 'safe storage' laws that make it a crime to leave a loaded firearm where it is accessible by children,\" Brady said. \n \n Brady also blamed gun makers for the Michigan shooting. \n \n \"The responsibility for shootings like these do not stop at the hands of the gun owner,\" Brady said. \"Why are ... gun makers manufacturing weapons that a six-year old child can fire? This makes no rational sense. When will gun makers realize that they bear a responsibility to make sure that their products do not mete out preventable deaths, and that they do not warrant nor deserve special protection from the law to avoid that burden? Instead of safeguarding the gun makers, we should be childproofing the guns.\" \n \n In contrast to near-complete bans in Australia and Great Britain, many U.S. states have passed liberal concealed carry laws that allow private citizens to obtain a permit to carry a loaded gun at all times in most public places. According to Yale University researcher John R. Lott, formerly of the University of Chicago and a gun control analyst who has conducted the most extensive study on the impact of concealed carry laws in the nation's history, the more liberal the right to carry, the less violent crime occurs. \n \n Lott, who examined a mass of crime data spanning decades in all 3,200-plus counties in the United States, concluded that the most important factor in the deterrence of violent crimes were increased police presence and longer jail sentences. However, his research also demonstrated that liberal concealed carry laws were at the top of the list of reasons violent crime has dropped steadily since those laws began to be enacted by state legislatures a decade ago. \n \n The Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, a division of Handgun Control, Inc., disagreed with Lott's findings, as well as the overall assumption that a reduction in the availability of guns in society reduces violent crime. \n \n \"Using violent crime data provided by the FBI, the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence determined that, on average over a five-year period, violent crime dropped almost 25 percent in states that limit or prohibit carrying concealed weapons,\" the Center said. \"This compares with only a 11 percent drop in states with lax concealed carry weapons (CCW) laws. Moreover, states with some of the strongest laws against concealed weapons experienced the largest drops.\" \n \n Without naming its source, the Center also claimed \"a prominent criminologist from Johns Hopkins University has stated that Lott's study was so flawed that 'nothing can be learned of it,' and that it should not be used as the basis for policy-making.\" \n \n In his most recent research, Lott noted a few examples of mass shootings in schools when teachers who were armed, albeit illegally, were able to prevent further loss of life among students indiscriminately targeted by other students with guns. \n \n Ironically, both Lott and Handgun Control acknowledge that the reams of gun control laws on the books in Washington and in all 50 states have been ineffective in eradicating mass shootings or preventing children from bringing weapons to school. However, Lott's research indicates the criminal element has been successful in obtaining weapons despite widespread bans and gun control laws, while HCI continues to push for more laws that further restrict, license or eliminate handguns and long guns.",

   "Gun bans don't equal freedom\n \n Posted: January 3, 2003\n 1:00 a.m. Eastern\n \n \u00a9 2003 WorldNetDaily.com \n \n A couple of the West's democracies are behaving less and less like the bastions of freedom they claim to be and more like authoritarian regimes rife with little Napoleons who want absolute control over their respective masses. \n \n Our Canadian neighbors have just implemented a nationwide gun registration plan that is already so grossly over budget, heads should roll. The $100 million-turned-$1 billion program to register the nation's 7.5 million firearms is proceeding apace; violators - rotten criminals that they are - face up to $2,000 in fines and five years in jail if they didn't register by Jan. 1. \n \n In Britain, meanwhile, police are planning to implement another firearms amnesty, despite the fact that a ban on handgun ownership was implemented in 1997 and 60,000 guns were turned in during the first amnesty a decade earlier. As one analyst put it, when English police didn't carry guns, there were few gun bans and crime was low. Now that they do, gun bans abound and crime is up. Go figure. \n \n Both of these measures are, as usual, being sold to the public and the world as \"crime prevention\" policies. Yet crime does not decline appreciably under such strict firearms rules. In fact, such regulations often create whole new classes of victims - victims that, before bans and amnesties, were able to defend themselves more effectively. \n \n That's not freedom, it's enslavement. Anything that makes people less dependent upon themselves and more dependent on government is anathema to liberty. \n \n Leaders of truly free countries trust their own citizens to be armed. They trust them because they have no designs on usurping power or becoming dictatorial. They trust them because they rely on them to help police enforce laws, to keep invaders out, and to keep citizens safe. \n \n History has proven that only leaders who fear an armed populace seek to disarm them - see Adolph Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Mao Tse Tung and, more recently, Fidel Castro. History has also shown that an armed populace is the people's best defense against authoritarianism - see the American Revolution, circa 1776. \n \n Gun-control laws are not indicative of the kind of benevolence a government must demonstrate in order to be kind to freedom and individualism. \n \n In the United States, there is a growing absence of this kind of benevolence. Though lawmakers know they cannot ban all guns outright, for example, they enact de facto bans, like the one on handguns in Maryland. As of Jan. 1, all handguns sold in the state must be designed with built-in trigger locks. Gun dealers there say dozens of models won't qualify and that manufacturers have no intention of building handguns that do qualify. That means, of course, that many will go out of business. Presto - instant pseudo-gun ban. \n \n In many major cities, some guns - mostly handguns - are banned completely, unless you happen to be a police officer or federal agent. Yet there's still plenty of crime, meaning lots of innocent people would be alive today if they were legally able to possess the means to defend themselves. \n \n That's another trend here in the U.S. - making gun-control laws apply to ordinary citizens but not to local, state and federal police forces. How anathema to freedom for leaders to disarm \"regular folk\" while empowering and arming only those who enforce the laws. How comforting for the liberty-minded to know he or she will have no effective defense against criminals and out-of-control government agents and police alike. \n \n Gun control laws serve the state and only the state. They don't serve liberty and freedom any more than laws against freedom of speech, religion or of the press are conducive to self-determination and independence. \n \n What the government gives the government can also take away, unless a free people determined to fight oppression have the means to do so.",

   "Great Britain and Gun Control: With Neither Liberty nor Safety \n \n Miguel A. Faria Jr., M.D.\n Tuesday July 11, 2000 \n \n Great Britain, which gave birth to the great political philosophy of classic liberalism and to America, the flowering of Western civilization, is in moral decline.\n \n Not content with holding Gen. Augusto Pinochet hostage, Britain now holds its own citizens hostage like an authoritarian nation that distrusts its own citizens with firearms.(1)\n \n Since 1996, when a madman went on a rampage killing 16 children and their teacher in Dunblane, Scotland, Great Britain has tightened to strangulation its already draconian gun control laws so that only certified members of approved target-shooting clubs are allowed to own guns. These must be .22 caliber or smaller and must be kept locked up at the club at all times.\n \n Guns have been virtually banned, and the God-given right to self-defense has been virtually abrogated in England.\n \n Dramatic Increase in Robberies and Other Crime\n \n And yet, crime has steadily risen in Britain in the last several years. The U.S. Department of Justice says a person is nearly twice as likely to be robbed, assaulted or have a vehicle stolen in Britain as in the United States. Although the U.S. remains ahead of Britain in rates of murder and rape, the gap is rapidly narrowing.\n \n And while robberies rose 81 percent in England and Wales, they fell 28 percent in the United States. Likewise, assaults increased 53 percent in England and Wales but declined 27 percent in the United States. Burglaries doubled in England but fell by half in the United States. And while motor vehicle theft rose 51 percent in England, it remained the same in America.\n \n To make matters worse for England - and this is also true for Canada - in those countries where citizens are disarmed in their own homes, day burglary is commonplace and dangerous because criminals know they will not be shot at if caught flagrante delicto. Not so in the U.S., where burglars not only prefer night burglaries but try to make sure homeowners are not in to avoid being shot at by the intended victim.\n \n The rising tide of thievery and burglaries in England has dubbed Britain \"a nation of thieves,\" wrote the London Sunday Times, which noted: \"More than one in three British men has a criminal record by the age of 40. While America has cut its crime rate dramatically Britain remains the crime capital of the West. Where have we gone wrong?\"(2) Perhaps England should look introspectively.\n \n The most drastic ascendancy of crimes in Britain was found in those types of felonies where recent studies in the U.S. have shown that guns in the hands of law-abiding citizens not only save lives but also protect private property, reduce injuries to good people, and crime is generally deterred.(3)\n \n Writing in the May/June 2000 issue of the Medical Sentinel of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS), Dr. Michael S. Brown writes that while the British laws have disarmed law-abiding citizens, \"a black market has flourished, as usual with prohibitions, to supply criminal elements. Up to 3 million illegal guns are in circulation in Britain, leading to a rise in drive-by shootings and gangland-style executions.\"\n \n Dr. Brown continues, \"Young criminals (ages 15 to 25 with prior convictions), according to the Sunday Times, 'own or have access to guns ranging from Beretta submachine guns to Luger pistols, which can be bought from underworld dealers for as little as \u00a3200 ($320 U.S.).'\"(4) In the U.S., ordinary citizens shoot three times as many criminals in self-defense as do the police.\n \n Recent work by professor John R. Lott Jr. at the University of Chicago has shown that allowing people to carry concealed weapons deters violent crime - without any apparent increase in accidental death or suicide. While neither state waiting periods nor the federal Brady Law is associated with a reduction in crime rates, adopting concealed-carry gun laws cuts death rates from public, multiple shootings like those in Littleton, Colo., this year or Dunblane, Scotland in 1996.\n \n Professor Lott found that when concealed-carry laws went into effect in a given county, murders fell by 8 percent, rapes by 5 percent and aggravated assaults by 7 percent. For each additional year concealed-carry gun laws have been in effect, the murder rate declines by 3 percent, robberies by more than 2 percent and rape by 1 percent.(5)\n \n Women Using Guns for Self-Defense\n \n Moreover, studies in the U.S. have shown that guns are the great equalizer for females when accosted in the streets or assaulted in their homes.\n \n When a woman is armed with a gun, up to 83 percent of the time she will be successful at preventing rape, and only half as likely of being injured in the process.(3) These figures should be good news in the U.S. for the 17 million American women estimated to carry guns, but not for those in Great Britain who have been proscribed from keeping guns for self-protection.\n \n While the number of rapes in the U.S. is still higher than in Great Britain, it is falling, whereas the rate of sex crimes and violent assaults in England and Wales is increasing rapidly because of their permissive criminal justice system and even greater tendency than the U.S. to rehabilitate rather than punish criminals - and, of course, the stringent policy of citizen disarmament.\n \n This pusillanimous policy advertises to sex criminals that they have nothing to fear not only from their criminal justice system but also from their intended victims.\n \n Will the British require another American Revolution to come to their moral senses? Or, instead, will we Americans reject our Second Amendment, the palladium of our liberties and our legacy of freedom?\n \n References\n \n 1.

   "Gun Control's Twisted Outcome\n \n Restricting firearms has helped make England more crime-ridden than the U.S.\n \n By Joyce Lee Malcolm\n \n On a June evening two years ago, Dan Rather made many stiff British upper lips quiver by reporting that England had a crime problem and that, apart from murder, \"theirs is worse than ours.\" The response was swift and sharp. \"Have a Nice Daydream,\" The Mirror, a London daily, shot back, reporting: \"Britain reacted with fury and disbelief last night to claims by American newsmen that crime and violence are worse here than in the US.\" But sandwiched between the article's battery of official denials -- \"totally misleading,\" \"a huge over-simplification,\" \"astounding and outrageous\" -- and a compilation of lurid crimes from \"the wild west culture on the other side of the Atlantic where every other car is carrying a gun,\" The Mirror conceded that the CBS anchorman was correct. Except for murder and rape, it admitted, \"Britain has overtaken the US for all major crimes.\"\n \n In the two years since Dan Rather was so roundly rebuked, violence in England has gotten markedly worse. Over the course of a few days in the summer of 2001, gun-toting men burst into an English court and freed two defendants; a shooting outside a London nightclub left five women and three men wounded; and two men were machine-gunned to death in a residential neighborhood of north London. And on New Year's Day this year a 19-year-old girl walking on a main street in east London was shot in the head by a thief who wanted her mobile phone. London police are now looking to New York City police for advice.\n \n None of this was supposed to happen in the country whose stringent gun laws and 1997 ban on handguns have been hailed as the \"gold standard\" of gun control. For the better part of a century, British governments have pursued a strategy for domestic safety that a 1992 Economist article characterized as requiring \"a restraint on personal liberty that seems, in most civilised countries, essential to the happiness of others,\" a policy the magazine found at odds with \"America's Vigilante Values.\" The safety of English people has been staked on the thesis that fewer private guns means less crime. The government believes that any weapons in the hands of men and women, however law-abiding, pose a danger, and that disarming them lessens the chance that criminals will get or use weapons.\n \n The results -- the toughest firearm restrictions of any democracy -- are credited by the world's gun control advocates with producing a low rate of violent crime. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell reflected this conventional wisdom when, in a 1988 speech to the American Bar Association, he attributed England's low rates of violent crime to the fact that \"private ownership of guns is strictly controlled.\" \n \n In reality, the English approach has not re-duced violent crime. Instead it has left law-abiding citizens at the mercy of criminals who are confident that their victims have neither the means nor the legal right to resist them. Imitating this model would be a public safety disaster for the United States.\n \n The illusion that the English government had protected its citizens by disarming them seemed credible because few realized the country had an astonishingly low level of armed crime even before guns were restricted. A government study for the years 1890-92, for example, found only three handgun homicides, an average of one a year, in a population of 30 million. In 1904 there were only four armed robberies in London, then the largest city in the world. A hundred years and many gun laws later, the BBC reported that England's firearms restrictions \"seem to have had little impact in the criminal underworld.\" Guns are virtually outlawed, and, as the old slogan predicted, only outlaws have guns. Worse, they are increasingly ready to use them.\n \n Nearly five centuries of growing civility ended in 1954. Violent crime has been climbing ever since. Last December, London's Evening Standard reported that armed crime, with banned handguns the weapon of choice, was \"rocketing.\" In the two years following the 1997 handgun ban, the use of handguns in crime rose by 40 percent, and the upward trend has continued. From April to November 2001, the number of people robbed at gunpoint in London rose 53 percent.\n \n Gun crime is just part of an increasingly lawless environment. From 1991 to 1995, crimes against the person in England's inner cities increased 91 percent. And in the four years from 1997 to 2001, the rate of violent crime more than doubled. Your chances of being mugged in London are now six times greater than in New York. England's rates of assault, robbery, and burglary are far higher than America's, and 53 percent of English burglaries occur while occupants are at home, compared with 13 percent in the U.S., where burglars admit to fearing armed homeowners more than the police. In a United Nations study of crime in 18 developed nations published in July, England and Wales led the Western world's crime league, with nearly 55 crimes per 100 people.\n \n This sea change in English crime followed a sea change in government policies. Gun regulations have been part of a more general disarmament based on the proposition that people don't need to protect themselves because society will protect them. It also will protect their neighbors: Police advise those who witness a crime to \"walk on by\" and let the professionals handle it. \n \n This is a reversal of centuries of common law that not only permitted but expected individuals to defend themselves, their families, and their neighbors when other help was not available. It was a legal tradition passed on to Americans. Personal security was ranked first among an individual's rights by William Blackstone, the great 18th-century exponent of the common law. It was a right, he argued, that no government could take away, since no government could protect the individual in his moment of need. A century later Blackstone's illustrious successor, A.V. Dicey, cautioned, \"discourage self-help and loyal subjects become the slaves of ruffians.\"\n \n But modern English governments have put public order ahead of the individual's right to personal safety. First the government clamped down on private possession of guns; then it forbade people to carry any article that might be used for self-defense; finally, the vigor of that self-defense was to be judged by what, in hindsight, seemed \"reasonable in the circumstances.\"\n \n The 1920 Firearms Act was the first serious British restriction on guns. Although crime was low in England in 1920, the government feared massive labor disruption and a Bolshevik revolution. In the circumstances, permitting the people to remain armed must have seemed an unnecessary risk. And so the new policy of disarming the public began. The Firearms Act required a would-be gun owner to obtain a certificate from the local chief of police, who was charged with determining whether the applicant had a good reason for possessing a weapon and was fit to do so. All very sensible. Parliament was assured that the intention was to keep weapons out of the hands of criminals and other dangerous persons. Yet from the start the law's enforcement was far more restrictive, and Home Office instructions to police -- classified until 1989 -- periodically narrowed the criteria. \n \n At first police were instructed that it would be a good reason to have a revolver if a person \"lives in a solitary house, where protection against thieves and burglars is essential, or has been exposed to definite threats to life on account of his performance of some public duty.\" By 1937 police were to discourage applications to possess firearms for house or personal protection. In 1964 they were told \"it should hardly ever be necessary to anyone to possess a firearm for the protection of his house or person\" and that \"this principle should hold good even in the case of banks and firms who desire to protect valuables or large quantities of money.\" \n \n In 1969 police were informed \"it should never be necessary for anyone to possess a firearm for the protection of his house or person.\" These changes were made without public knowledge or debate. Their enforcement has consumed hundreds of thousands of police hours. Finally, in 1997 handguns were banned. Proposed exemptions for handicapped shooters and the British Olympic team were rejected.\n \n Even more sweeping was the 1953 Prevention of Crime Act, which made it illegal to carry in a public place any article \"made, adapted, or intended\" for an offensive purpose \"without lawful authority or excuse.\" Carrying something to protect yourself was branded antisocial. Any item carried for possible defense automatically became an offensive weapon. Police were given extensive power to stop and search everyone. Individuals found with offensive items were guilty until proven innocent.\n \n During the debate over the Prevention of Crime Act in the House of Commons, a member from Northern Ireland told his colleagues of a woman employed by Parliament who had to cross a lonely heath on her route home and had armed herself with a knitting needle. A month earlier, she had driven off a youth who tried to snatch her handbag by jabbing him \"on a tender part of his body.\" Was it to be an offense to carry a knitting needle? The attorney general assured the M.P. that the woman might be found to have a reasonable excuse but added that the public should be discouraged \"from going about with offensive weapons in their pockets; it is the duty of society to protect them.\"\n \n Another M.P. pointed out that while \"society ought to undertake the defense of its members, nevertheless one has to remember that there are many places where society cannot get, or cannot get there in time. On those occasions a man has to defend himself and those whom he is escorting. It is not very much consolation that society will come forward a great deal later, pick up the bits, and punish the violent offender.\"\n \n In the House of Lords, Lord Saltoun argued: \"The object of a weapon was to assist weakness to cope with strength and it is this ability that the bill was framed to destroy. I do not think any government has the right, though they may very well have the power, to deprive people for whom they are responsible of the right to defend themselves.\" But he added: \"Unless there is not only a right but also a fundamental willingness amongst the people to defend themselves, no police force, however large, can do it.\"\n \n That willingness was further undermined by a broad revision of criminal law in 1967 that altered the legal standard for self-defense. Now everything turns on what seems to be \"reasonable\" force against an assailant, considered after the fact. As Glanville Williams notes in his Textbook of Criminal Law, that requirement is \"now stated in such mitigated terms as to cast doubt on whether it [self-defense] still forms part of the law.\"\n \n The original common law standard was similar to what still prevails in the U.S. Americans are free to carry articles for their protection, and in 33 states law-abiding citizens may carry concealed guns. Americans may defend themselves with deadly force if they believe that an attacker is about to kill or seriously injure them, or to prevent a violent crime. Our courts are mindful that, as Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes observed, \"detached reflection cannot be demanded in the presence of an upraised knife.\" \n \n But English courts have interpreted the 1953 act strictly and zealously. Among articles found illegally carried with offensive intentions are a sandbag, a pickaxe handle, a stone, and a drum of pepper. \"Any article is capable of being an offensive weapon,\" concede the authors of Smith and Hogan Criminal Law, a popular legal text, although they add that if the article is unlikely to cause an injury the onus of proving intent to do so would be \"very heavy.\"\n \n The 1967 act has not been helpful to those obliged to defend themselves either. Granville Williams points out: \"For some reason that is not clear, the courts occasionally seem to regard the scandal of the killing of a robber as of greater moment than the safety of the robber's victim in respect of his person and property.\"\n \n A sampling of cases illustrates the impact of these measures:\n \n \u0095 In 1973 a young man running on a road at night was stopped by the police and found to be carrying a length of steel, a cycle chain, and a metal clock weight. He explained that a gang of youths had been after him. At his hearing it was found he had been threatened and had previously notified the police. The justices agreed he had a valid reason to carry the weapons. Indeed, 16 days later he was attacked and beaten so badly he was hospitalized. But the prosecutor appealed the ruling, and the appellate judges insisted that carrying a weapon must be related to an imminent and immediate threat. They sent the case back to the lower court with directions to convict.\n \n \u0095 In 1987 two men assaulted Eric Butler, a 56-year-old British Petroleum executive, in a London subway car, trying to strangle him and smashing his head against the door. No one came to his aid. He later testified, \"My air supply was being cut off, my eyes became blurred, and I feared for my life.\" In desperation he unsheathed an ornamental sword blade in his walking stick and slashed at one of his attackers, stabbing the man in the stomach. The assailants were charged with wounding. Butler was tried and convicted of carrying an offensive weapon. \n \n \u0095 In 1994 an English homeowner, armed with a toy gun, managed to detain two burglars who had broken into his house while he called the police. When the officers arrived, they arrested the homeowner for using an imitation gun to threaten or intimidate. In a similar incident the following year, when an elderly woman fired a toy cap pistol to drive off a group of youths who were threatening her, she was arrested for putting someone in fear. Now the police are pressing Parliament to make imitation guns illegal.\n \n \u0095 In 1999 Tony Martin, a 55-year-old Norfolk farmer living alone in a shabby farmhouse, awakened to the sound of breaking glass as two burglars, both with long criminal records, burst into his home. He had been robbed six times before, and his village, like 70 percent of rural English communities, had no police presence. He sneaked downstairs with a shotgun and shot at the intruders. Martin received life in prison for killing one burglar, 10 years for wounding the second, and a year for having an unregistered shotgun. The wounded burglar, having served 18 months of a three-year sentence, is now free and has been granted \u00a35,000 of legal assistance to sue Martin.\n \n The failure of English policy to produce a safer society is clear, but what of British jibes about \"America's vigilante values\" and our much higher murder rate?\n \n Historically, America has had a high homicide rate and England a low one. In a comparison of New York and London over a 200-year period, during most of which both populations had unrestricted access to firearms, historian Eric Monkkonen found New York's homicide rate consistently about five times London's. Monkkonen pointed out that even without guns, \"the United States would still be out of step, just as it has been for two hundred years.\"\n \n Legal historian Richard Maxwell Brown has argued that Americans have more homicides because English law insists an individual should retreat when attacked, whereas Americans believe they have the right to stand their ground and kill in self-defense. Americans do have more latitude to protect themselves, in keeping with traditional common law standards, but that would have had less significance before England's more restrictive policy was established in 1967. \n \n The murder rates of the U.S. and U.K. are also affected by differences in the way each counts homicides. The FBI asks police to list every homicide as murder, even if the case isn't subsequently prosecuted or proceeds on a lesser charge, making the U.S. numbers as high as possible. By contrast, the English police \"massage down\" the homicide statistics, tracking each case through the courts and removing it if it is reduced to a lesser charge or determined to be an accident or self-defense, making the English numbers as low as possible. \n \n The London-based Office of Health Economics, after a careful international study, found that while \"one reason often given for the high numbers of murders and manslaughters in the United States is the easy availability of firearms...the strong correlation with racial and socio-economic variables suggests that the underlying determinants of the homicide rate are related to particular cultural factors.\"\n \n Cultural differences and more-permissive legal standards notwithstanding, the English rate of violent crime has been soaring since 1991. Over the same period, America's has been falling dramatically. In 1999 The Boston Globe reported that the American murder rate, which had fluctuated by about 20 percent between 1974 and 1991, was \"in startling free-fall.\" We have had nine consecutive years of sharply declining violent crime. As a result the English and American murder rates are converging. In 1981 the American rate was 8.7 times the English rate, in 1995 it was 5.7 times the English rate, and the latest study puts it at 3.5 times. \n \n Preliminary figures for the U.S. this year show an increase, although of less than 1 percent, in the overall number of violent crimes, with homicide increases in certain cities, which criminologists attribute to gang violence, the poor economy, and the release from prison of many offenders. Yet Americans still enjoy a substantially lower rate of violent crime than England, without the \"restraint on personal liberty\" English governments have seen as necessary. Rather than permit individuals more scope to defend themselves, Prime Minister Tony Blair's government plans to combat crime by extending those \"restraints on personal liberty\": removing the prohibition against double jeopardy so people can be tried twice for the same crime, making hearsay evidence admissible in court, and letting jurors know of a suspect's previous crimes. \n \n This is a cautionary tale. America's founders, like their English forebears, regarded personal security as first of the three primary rights of mankind. That was the main reason for including a right for individuals to be armed in the U.S. Constitution. Not everyone needs to avail himself or herself of that right. It is a dangerous right. But leaving personal protection to the police is also dangerous.\n \n The English government has effectively abolished the right of Englishmen, confirmed in their 1689 Bill of Rights, to \"have arms for their defence,\" insisting upon a monopoly of force it can succeed in imposing only on law-abiding citizens. It has come perilously close to depriving its people of the ability to protect themselves at all, and the result is a more, not less, dangerous society. Despite the English tendency to decry America's \"vigilante values,\" English policy makers would do well to consider a return to these crucial common law values, which stood them so well in the past. \n \n Joyce Lee Malcolm, a professor of history at Bentley College and a senior adviser to the MIT Security Studies Program, is the author of Guns and Violence: The English Experience, published in May by Harvard University Press.",

   "England has worst crime rate in world\n By David Bamber, Home Affairs Correspondent\n (Filed: 01/12/2002) \n \n England and Wales have the highest crime rate among the world's leading economies, according to a new report by the United Nations.\n \n The survey, which is likely to prove embarrassing to David Blunkett, the Home Secretary. shows that people are more likely to be mugged, burgled, robbed or assaulted here than in America, Germany, Russia, South Africa or any other of the world's 20 largest nations. Only the Dominican Republic, New Zealand and Finland have higher crime rates than England and Wales.\n \n According to the comparison of international crime statistics produced by the UN's Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention, England and Wales had 9,766 crimes for every 100,000 people in the year 2000. America had 8,517, South Africa 7,997, Germany 7,621 and Russia 2,022.\n \n During the period 1998-2000, Britain went from fifth to fourth worst in the world league table. An analysis of total recorded crime figures before 1998 also suggests that England and Wales have moved sharply up the league table since Labour came to power in 1997. Crimes fell from 5.5 million in 1993 to 4.5 million in 1997. By 1999, total crimes had risen again to 5.3 million.\n \n Last night Oliver Letwin, the shadow home secretary, said: \"This does rather blow a hole in David Blunkett's claim that New Labour has crime under control. It is a damning picture.\"\n \n The UN reports also shows that England and Wales are the second-worst places in the world for assaults, with 851 people assaulted per 100,000, and seventh for burglaries and car theft, with 1,579 burglaries per 100,000 population.\n \n Criminologists believe that a note of caution needs to be introduced into analysis of the data, because of the different ways in which UN member countries record crimes.\n \n A Home Office spokesman said that officials had not yet seen the report and so could not comment.",

   "Street crime under control? You must be joking, say Blunkett's neighbours \n By Adam Lusher\n (Filed: 06/10/2002) \n \n The government's claim to have street crime \"under control\" was denounced as a joke last week by the Home Secretary's neighbours in Sheffield.\n \n People living in the streets around David Blunkett's home reacted with scorn to his suggestion that police were winning the war on crime.\n \n Mr Blunkett has heralded figures showing street crime down by 14 per cent in 10 urban areas, saying the message is clear: street crime has been brought \"under control\" before autumn - just as Tony Blair promised in the spring.\n \n At the Labour conference last week, the Prime Minister boasted: \"It's a fact that overall crime is down.\"\n \n Five minutes' walk from Mr Blunkett's home, however, Margaret Smith, 90, had a very different opinion. She has just spent four weeks in hospital after being attacked in her home. The last time she went to the post office, a man in his twenties followed her home and barged in when she opened the door.\n \n He threw her to the floor, breaking both her legs, grabbed her purse and kicked her in the back when he found no cash in it. He then ran off with her handbag, which contained a large sum of money.\n \n Speaking softly, while leaning on the Zimmer frame that she now needs to help her to walk, Mrs Smith gestured from one end of her small sitting room to the sofa opposite: \"He kicked me from here to there. It was terrifying.\"\n \n She added stoically: \"I'm a bit better now. I'm getting used to going out, as long as there are people with me.\"\n \n At a nearby social club, one of her relatives, Billy Ward, 47, a road worker, was angry about what had happened to \"grandma\". He was not happy, either, about Mr Blunkett's suggestion that street crime was under control.\n \n \"It's a joke,\" he said. \"Ask him if he walks up here at night on his own. Under control? It's got worse.\"\n \n In Mr Blunkett's street, which The Telegraph cannot name for security reasons, some residents said the regular police presence around his home had deterred joyriders and the youths who stole from garden sheds. Even here, however, crime remains a problem. Many people have put up razor wire and security lights.\n \n Kathleen Langstaff, 68, a retired police secretary, said: \"I would never go on the streets after dark. You're not safe anywhere.\"\n \n The locals' views will not make welcome reading for Mr Blunkett, especially after The Telegraph revealed last week that overall crime levels were growing rapidly.\n \n South Yorkshire Police, which covers Sheffield, was one of the 10 forces involved in the Government's promise to bring street crime \"under control\". A spokesman said: \"Street crime is under control. Theft from person has been reduced by around 17 per cent in Sheffield since April while robberies have gone down seven per cent.\"\n \n Back in Mr Blunkett's neighbourhood, there are suspicions that the figures are not wholly accurate. The attack on Mrs Smith, for example, began with a thug following her in the street, but is not classed as a \"street crime\" because it happened in her home.\n \n Stefan Moverley, 21, the manager of a community centre, said he had complained to police about street gangs. \"A lot of the kids have got blades and are drugged out of their heads on aerosol gas,\" he said. \"You don't feel safe walking around at night.\"\n \n Later this month, residents are to hold a public meeting about crime. Police representatives will attend. \"They'll get a grilling because they've done nothing at all,\" said Mr Moverley. \"Things are probably worse than last year.\n \n \"I would really like Mr Blunkett to come along to listen to local people and hear what's really happening, rather than reading the statistics he wants to read. If he thinks it's under control, he's not living in Sheffield - he's living on another planet.\"",

Not fanciful stories about Nazi's seizing guns.\" \n http://www.guncite.com/gun_control_gcnazimyth.html\n\n \n Funny how you pick and choose what you want to hear from pro-gun sites... simply because governments are doing the killing why do you not see that if governments have guns and the people do not then tyranny is a very real possibillity. When the people have guns the government is much more cautious..... Governments killed over 170 million people last century. I haven't killed any. So why restrict me...\n \n Oh and while your selectivly taking stuff from guncite why don't you read this.... International Violent Death Rates\n . Now if you believe that a gun is an inanimate object and can not hurt anyone on its own just like a toaster then you can plainly see France is a much more dangerous country to live in...\n \n \n And I leave you with:\n \n The Misconceptions of Gun Control as a Lifesaver \n \n \" I know no safe depository of the ultimate powers of the society but the people themselves; and if we think them not enlightened enough to exercise their control with a wholesale discretion, the remedy is not to take it from them, but to inform their discretion by education. This is the true corrective of abuses of constitutional power.\" \n \n Thomas Jefferson and our founding fathers never meant for our country to be a country that depended on the government to take away rights to take care of its people, but instead envisioned a country with able-bodied Americans that are capable of making responsible decisions on their own. The right to bear arms is just what it should be, a right. A right is not a privilege that changes through a cost and benefit analysis. People do not understand this right, or how it applies to the freedom of the people in this great nation. Nor do people see the benefits of a right, such as the one to bear arms. People through media grow misconceptions of the right for a law-biding citizen to carry a concealed weapon. Often people, through media, are never given truths that may change their opinion on issues, such as gun control. The only way to counter this media bias is to educate people with the truth just Thomas Jefferson had always envisioned. \n The media of shooting incidents add to the growth of the misunderstanding of guns and how they are, and should be used. A good example of how the media grows this misconception is Nathaniel Brazill, a fourteen-year-old accused of murdering his teacher. Nathaniel murdered his teacher by pointing a gun at her face and pulling the trigger. When it came for the time of him testifying he claimed that the gun went off \"accidentally,\" and with that the media put the blame of his murder on the gun. Only people that are unfamiliar with guns and are ignorant of how they operate would believe that, \"guns go off by themselves\". The mentality that, \"guns go off by themselves\", is just mentality that puts the fear of guns over the truth of how guns do not have a mind of their own. The truth is that gun restrictions give criminals more of an incentive to commit crimes against the unarmed citizen. \n Great Britain is a good example of how making guns illegal produces a society of criminals that, because they know that citizens are unarmed, they have a no fear of citizens that they commit the crime against. The country has one of the highest contact crime, (assault, robbery and sexual attack), rates in the world. In 2001, Great Britain had 3.6% of their population being victimized by crime . A few months after private guns were outlawed, the BBC news decided to report the affect that their country has suffered. \n \n Between April and November 2001, the number of murders in the Metropolitan police area [of London] committed with a fire arm soared by almost 90 percent over the same period a year earlier.... Although all privately-owned handguns in Britain are now officially illegal, the tightened rules seem to have had little impact on the criminal underworld. No one knows how many illegal firearms there are in Britain, although estimates range from 200,000 to several million. Whatever the true figure, it is said to be growing daily. \n \n Britain though does not have a higher murder than the United States, Britain does surpass the United States in other categories. The according to the Department of Justice, criminals in Great Britain rob, assault and steal cars at twice the rates found in the United States. From the years 1996-2000, Britain's robberies climbed 81% and in contrast to the U.S. where robberies fell 28% in the same time period. In the same time period Britain's assaults rose by 53%, again in comparison to the U.S. robberies declined by 27%. Burglaries grew by about 100% in Britain and fell by about 50% in U.S. That is still not the end of the growing crime rate in Britain. In Britain they have instances where a burglar enters a home while the resident is also home, they call these \"hot\" burglaries. Authorities say that 50% of Britain's burglaries are \"hot\", while in the United States only 13% of the burglaries are \"hot\". The fact that gun control creates more crime in Great Britain proves that with gun restrictions you are only empowering criminals with defenseless victims that without a gun are unable to protect or match themselves against criminals. \n \n A comparison that people often use to show that gun control \"works\" is the comparison between Japan and the United States. This comparison though is often misinterpreted. Japan, with outlawed guns, has a murder rate of one per 100,000. In the United States there are 3.2 murders per 100,000 weapons other than firearms. This just shows the cultural difference between the United States and Japan. Even without guns the United State's murder rate is three times than that of Japan. That still does not mean that Japan's crime rate is also low because of stringent gun laws. According to the International Crime Survey, murder, rape, and arson has increased 95% from 1991-2001. That still is not the end, Japan also suffers from a higher suicide rate per capita than the United States. 17 out of 100,000 people commit suicide in Japan, in comparison to the U.S., 11.1 per 100,000. The data comes to show yet again that gun control does not equal less crime; on the contrary, it equals rises in crimes committed. \n Many people through the media never hear this argument; Guns are used as a deterrence to crime among law-biding citizens. It is true; guns are used as a deterrence through randomness among citizens. Criminals would not know which law-biding citizen is carrying a concealed weapon that could protect themselves from criminal predators. Criminals would not act as quick to rob a grocery store to only find out that the customers or workers have a guns. This is a concept that many police officers understand. A survey made by the National Association of Chiefs of Police, showed that over 60% of police chiefs and sheriffs want to permit law-biding citizens to carry concealed weapons. Another question on the survey that was asked for the first time of the fourteen years of the survey's existence was, \"Do you agree that a national concealed handgun permit would reduce rates of violent crime as studies in some states have already reflected?\", 62% of the sheriffs and chiefs responded \"yes\". \n Not only do citizens owning guns serve as a deterrence to crime, but it also stops crimes in progress. The right for a citizen to own a gun in their home is also that citizen's right to self-defense. Not many times do I hear stories through the media of a person using their gun in self-defense. The reason for this is not only that citizens that use guns for defensive purposes hardly ever call the police or reporters and media does not see some one that saved themselves from a burglary as news compared to some one killed in a burglary. I did though find a shimmer of hope in the media. The Los Angeles Times proposed a challenge to a man who supported the right for citizens to carry guns, John Lott. The challenge that John Lott, the author of the book More Guns Less Crime, was given was to take a week and find citizens that use guns for defensive purposes. This challenge was unfair, because as I said before citizens that use guns for defensive purposes rarely call the police. Despite of the challenge's unfairness, John Lott found twenty examples of citizens using guns for defensive purposes in only one week. The Los Angeles Times agreed to publish his results. One of the stories I found, in Salt Lake City Utah, to be quite interesting has to how business owner of his son saved not only their lives, but also the lives of their customers. \n \n Two Robbers began firing their guns as soon as they entered a pawnshop. The owner and his son returned fire. One of the robbers was shot in the arm; both later were arrested. The shop owner's statement said it all: \"if we did not have our guns, we would have had several people dead here. \n \n The Los Angeles times though does not realize that there could have been an easier way as to how to find stories of people using guns defensively. Pick up any issue of the, American Rifleman, and read a column called, The Armed Citizen. The column, The Armed Citizen, gives real life stories of the defensive uses against guns. One issue said the following: \n \n Bobby Wolfe was locking the front door of his Moon Lake, Miss., store one night when a man came around the icebox near the door, pointed a gun and demanded money. \" He had a gun in his hand, and the other hand was over his face,\" Wolfe recalled. The storekeeper dropped and pulled a .38-cal. Revolver in his pocket. \"we think the robber shot first and Mr.Wolfe returned fire,\" stated Cuohoma County Sheriff Andrew Thompson of the exchange that followed. When Wolfe took off running for his nearby home, he encountered a second gunman who began firing at him. \"He shot two or three times and I shot one more time,\" said Wolfe. Within five minutes of the robbery, one gunman was dead, Wolfe was wounded, and the police picked up three suspects- one of whom was mortally wounded- making a getaway. Wolfe later said of the men, whom he recognized, \"I'm sure they intended to kill me because they knew I'd recognize them.\"(The Clarksdale Press Register, Clarksdale, Miss., 10/29/01). \n \n Not in all cases does the victim kill the attacker when owning a gun. According to research done in the University of Florida and the research done in the University of Chicago, only one out of 1,000 defensive gun uses does result in the attackers death. Also that 98% of the Time just brandishing a gun is sufficient to stop a crime. \n Gun control takes away the biggest fear that perpetrator may have, the fear that their victim may own a gun. Owning a gun is a safety precaution, just like locking your door at night. No one would want to use a gun, but when it comes to protection and preservation of life, it is a necessary. Not many people would commit a crime if they thought that maybe, just maybe someone has a gun here and knows how to use it. There are many stories that the media should show on people saving themselves by owning a gun. Gun control is a violation of a citizen's rights under the constitution and would be harmful to society. Thomas Jefferson spoke the truth; do not take away a citizen's right if you think that person is unable to control their right, instead educate society, and they will grow in their own responsibility.",

Subsequently, from 1915 to 1917, 1.5-million Armenians, deprived of the means to defend themselves, were rounded up and killed.\n \n >> Senator Diane Feinstein, speaking on \"60-Minutes\" immediately after the passage of the Brady Bill said, \"if I thought I could get the votes, I'd have taken them all.\" That's not paranoia; that is the clearly stated objective of a liberal Democrat U.S. senator.\n \n >> The Soviet Union established gun control in 1929. Then from 1929 to 1953, approximately 20-millon dissidents - again, deprived of the means to defend themselves - were rounded up and killed.\n \n >> April 5, 1996, Charles Krauthammer wrote in the Washington Post, \"the Brady Bill's only effect will be to desensitize the public to regulation of weapons in preparation for their ultimate confiscation.\" \"Ultimate,\" as in inevitable, eventually, sometime in the future ... not now ...

Winship wrote in Editor and Publisher Magazine, April 24, 1993, \"Investigate the NRA with renewed vigor. Print names of those who take NRA funds. Support all causes the NRA opposes. ... The work a day guy doesn't envision total confiscation, but many with the real power to sway public opinion and effect change in America do.\"\n \n >> China has more practice than anyone does in disarming potential dissenters.

Subsequently, between 1948 and 1952, over 20-million dissidents, again deprived of the tools for self defense, were rounded up and killed.\n \n >> Democrat Representative W. Clay was quoted in the St. Louis Post Dispatch of May 8, 1993, regarding the Brady Bill. He said it is \"the minimum step\" Congress should take. \"We need much stricter gun control and eventually we should bar ownership of handguns except in a few cases.\"\n \n >> Cambodia enshrined gun control in 1956. In just two years (1975-1977) over one million \"educated\" people were rounded up and killed.\n \n >> Guatemala locked in gun control in 1964. From 1964 to 1981, over 100,000 Mayan Indians were rounded up and killed as a result of their inability to defend themselves.\n \n >> Former President of NBC News M. Gartner was quoted in USA Today, Jan. 16, 1992, as saying, \"I now think the only way to control handgun use is to prohibit the guns. And the only way to do that is to change the Constitution.\" Hello?!\n \n >> Uganda got gun control in 1970. Over the next nine years over 300,000 Christians were rounded up and killed.\n \n Peter Shields, founder of Handgun Control Inc. was quoted in the New Yorker Magazine, June 26, 1976, with what frankly crystallizes the alleged paranoia many of us have for preserving the Second Amendment. \n \n \"We'll take one step at a time, and the first is necessarily ... given the political realities ... very modest. We'll have to start working again to strengthen the law, and then again to strengthen the next law and again and again. Our ultimate goal, total control of handguns, is going to take time. The first problem is to make possession of all handguns and ammunition (with a few exceptions) totally illegal.\"\n \n Over 56-million people have died because of gun control in the last century. Is there an identifiable trend? A common denominator? Sure! The victims were unarmed.\n \n \n \n Your a bigot because you said:\n \n \"It also give the right to equipment with which you could execute murders, armed robberies and other violent crime. \" \n \n Just because I have the right to certain tools does not automatically make me want to commit crimes with these legal tools. I could do those things that you claimed but I wouldn't need a gun to do so.... The fact that you so easilly lump me into such a group simply because I own guns is rather predjudiced of you.",

   "Exactly. \"Socialist democracy\" is a long standing plan to get us back to socialism. Socialism and democracy are pretty incompatable in their pure forms. Communism is more or less the purist form of democracy, and fascism is just a pretty bad thing.\n\n \n Hmmm... Perhaps we should start a seperate thread on this subject (or perhaps move the discussion to the \"distinction\" thread.) I would very much like to know how you argue that socialism (even with the Marxist definition of socialism as a transitory state for communism) would be incompatible with democracy.",

   "MP Calls UK Radio 4 Listeners 'Bastards' Over Vote! \n \n By Vincent Graff \n Media Editor \n \n The Independent - UK\n 1-4-4\n \n It was trailed as a \"unique chance to rewrite the law of the land\". Listeners to BBC Radio 4's Today programme were asked to suggest a piece of legislation to improve life in Britain, with the promise that an MP would then attempt to get it onto the statute books. \n \n But yesterday, 26,000 votes later, the winning proposal was denounced as a \"ludicrous, brutal, unworkable blood-stained piece of legislation\" - by Stephen Pound, the very MP whose job it is to try to push it through Parliament. \n \n Mr Pound's reaction was provoked by the news that the winner of Today's \"Listeners' Law\" poll was a plan to allow homeowners \"to use any means to defend their home from intruders\" - a prospect that could see householders free to kill burglars, without question. \n \n \"The people have spoken,\" the Labour MP replied to the programme, \"... the bastards.\" \n \n Having recovered his composure, Mr Pound told The Independent: \"We are going to have to re-evaluate the listenership of Radio 4. I would have expected this result if there had been a poll in The Sun. Do we really want a law that says you can slaughter anyone who climbs in your window?\" \n \n Journalists on Today are thought to have been taken aback by the choice of their listeners. Observers had assumed that the winning suggestion might be a little more light-hearted - and a little less illiberal. \n \n Indeed, there were suspicions the vote may have been hijacked by supporters of Tony Martin, the Norfolk farmer who was jailed for shooting a burglar. The winning proposal enjoyed a late surge in support in the final 24 hours of the poll, a jump attributed by the BBC to the fact that telephone votes - which were more firmly in favour of the anti-burglar proposal - were added at the last minute. \n \n Today's long-running Personality of the Year poll was scrapped in 1997, after persistent attempts by political parties to fix it. \n \n Mr Pound will go through the motions of presenting the Bill to Parliament but hoped he would fail. He said it was \"the sort of idea somebody comes up with in a bar on a Saturday night between 'string 'em all up' and 'send 'em all all home'\". \n \n http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/media/story.jsp?story=477413",

Coe over and take a look. I am not nearly ad well versed in the theory of a social democracy as I would like to be. I understand the concept, but it seems that it is less a \"socialist\" agenda than something alltoghether new.......",
