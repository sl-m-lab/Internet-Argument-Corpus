   "I believe the rationale for treating persons of different age differently is their respective ability to understand their actions. The human nervous system is not fully developed until adulthood, therefore the ability to appreciate right from wrong, understand consequences of actions and mediate impulse control (among other things) differs between children and adults.

The reasoning is that the criminal behavior may actually be different even if the outcome of the behavior is not. \n \n There is considerable evidence that neurophysiology and its resultant behavior does not develop completely until adulthood.

We have here two contradictory statements. That is what I was pointing out.\n\n I think many things are getting confused here.\n \n First, I have no idea what \"moral maturity\" means. You talk as though that is some definable entity.\n Next, one may reasonably consider that children are cognitively different from adults. Despite what society or 5 judges have to say, that seems to me a valid reason for applying different sentences to different people.\n \n The question was raised with respect to the death penalty as well. We are not talking about criteria for guilt, but once convicted, we are talking about whether to execute a person or not. Unless you feel that punishment should be based solely on retribution, I think there is some wiggle room for different sentencing guidelines for different aged humans. \n \n You have conceded that a difference in neurophysiologic fitness makes sense, but we should decide on a case by case basis. If you can figure out a reliable way to do that, go for it. \n \n We draw the line based upon age all the time for all sorts of things.\n \n The issue of abortion is different for many reasons. We are not deciding on whether to execute a person based upon a crime they committed. That makes it a different issue. Ideally, we would never have a pregnant young woman under the age of 18 make a decision like that without the support and guidance of her loving parents. The ideal situation sometimes does not exist. An underage female may legally make this decision precisely because there are many out there who do not have that guidance at all or informing parents would make things worse. It just so happens that females are fertile prior to 18, so we do not have the luxury of applying similar age requirements. If you could ban pregnancy prior to 18, now you'd be talking.\n \n \n\n No, this is not about abortion, and I think that is very clear. If I wanted to discuss abortion, then I would mosey on along to the abortion forum and post there.\n\n And no, it is not at all clear that this is not about abortion, Phyl, because you keep bringing the topic up. Because you declare something, that doesn't make it so.\n \n Lastly, you are asking the opinions of members of a forum here. If you want our opinions, great. If our opinions differ from some court ruling, it does not mean the opinions are wrong, it means they differ. Given your criterion, the only way to express opinions here would be if we were doing it from the bench.",

   "Assuming capital punishment, in the prescribed form, is constitutional, it is still not constitutional to execute a person for a crime committed at 17. It has been tried and I think was successful, but in my opinion, as I will depict below, is not constitutional. \n \n First, we must establish the age of majority at 18. Majority is defined as the ability to enter contracts and be held accountable in court. The first part of that definition is for the most part inconsequential to this argument. However, it shows knowledge of consequence. A 17 year old cannot, by himself, purchase a car on a note. Because he can't be held liable for the note and he is assumed to not understand the consequences of that contract.\n \n Now, we must define juvenille, one who is not of the age of majority. Therefore, do not understand consequences and are unable to enter into contracts. I take exception to the notion that a 14, 15, 16 or 17 year old can be bound over to adult court for crimes committed as, our law defines, a child. These children did not enjoy, nor do they gain, the privelleges of adulthood. They do not gain the right to vote, the right to enter into a contract, or the right to drink, etc. Threfore, at the time of the crime and while sitting in court they are not adults. And cannot be subject to an adult sentence. By the way, we have signed treaties saying it is illegal to execute minors, and those are law... What you have proposed for discussion generally shows a desparity of our criminal justice system. Our societies thirst for blood outweighs our moral conciousness. \n \n It's wrong, but it happens.",
