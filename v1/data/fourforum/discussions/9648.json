   "I find this latest right-wing \"gay\" sex scandal -- the one about the porn actor who was lionized at the recent conservative conference -- to be hilariously funny. Here you have a Marine, no less, who's been in some dozen or so gay porn films. But, get this, the military isn't sure he'll be kicked out under DADT because the guy claims to be straight and only did it for the money!\n \n I guess the Defense Dept. must be a hotbed of liberals, since as we all know, real conservatives -- like the ones on this forum -- believe that this stuff about homosexuality as an innate sexual orientation is gay activist hogwash, and that it's all \"about the behavior, stupid!\"?\n \n I don't how many times having same-sex is necessary to qualify in their eyes as a Real, Official Homosexual, but I'd say that on the basis of the number of listings for \"Rod Majors\" on on-line video sites, he would seem to have earned his, um, oak-leaf clusters by this time.",
