   "On The Verge Of A Global Food Crisis - Agustino Fontevecchia - Moral Hazard - Forbes\n \n \nA week after the UN's Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) warned of a possible \"food price shock\" if prices continued to rise, the USDA downwardly revised its outlook for global harvests of key crops, sending future prices surging and fueling concerns over a repeat of the 2008 food crisis which sparked riots in over 30 countries. With riots already occurring in Algeria and Mozambique, the impending crisis even sparked a reaction by World Bank Chief Robert Zoellick, who sought to calm the already uneasy markets.\n \n The global food situation doesn't look too promising, as floods in Australia and excessively hot weather in Latin America harm harvests, upward pressure is mounting on prices. According to the FAO, a basket tracking the wholesale cost of food commodities such as wheat, corn, rice, vegetable oils, and meats, has already topped 2008's peak values, reaching 214.5 points (compared to 213.5 on June 2008). And, as the USDA cuts its global grain supply outlook, soybean, corn, and wheat prices have spiked, nearing or passing 30-month highs.\n\n \n \n Just remember that this has NOTHING TO DO WITH the fact that we are now turning about 30% of our global corn and vegetable oil production and 40% of the global sugar production into fuel for our suburbans. The europeans are turning it into fuel for whatever ugly little boxy thing is popular there this year :)\n \n I love this one:\n \n Are you financially ready for a food crisis? | Reuters\n \n \n3. Change your diet: We aren't suggesting that you should starve. But, if food affordability gets stretched, this constraint might just be the catalyst that finally helps you act on your new year's resolution to start dieting.\n\n \n Wow! So these high food prices may be a GOOD thing! They will help you eat less!! Look at all the wonderful things that unaffordable food has done for ethiopia! Lowest rate of obesity on the planet! \n \n I keep seeing pretty much everybody predicting oil over $100 in 2011 as well.\n \n While low crop production and our idiotic use of food for fuel for our vehicles certainly bears a lot of blame in this, those worthless XXXXXX at the federal reserve and their massive money printing operation also bear a lot of the blame. Fed overprints, dollar falls, commodities priced in dollars get mroe expensive. It isn't exactly rocket science. \n \n I think I have pointed out before that the big hole in the feds QE logic was the fact that lowering the value of the dollar leads to disproportionately large increases in food and energy prices, so they essentially plan to \"save\" the economy by eliminating all the consumers disposable income. \n \n The swear filter will not allow me to give a heart felt analysis of this, or of the intelligence of the people doing this.",

This time it looks like we are going to recover and our entire freaking economy is going to collapse and our government is going to fail. The only thing that has kept us afloat is the \"safe harbor\" perception surrounding the dollar and US treasuries and even with the fed buying up treasuries to create artificial demand, and so many investors holding them as a safe investment through the turmoil, with due respect the rates on them are still pretty damn high. What is going to happen as the rest of the world starts shrugging off the recession and the US does not????\n \n We did NOT \"fix\" the mortgage market problem and despite the fact that we now have 2 huge GSA's whose mandate is LITERALLY to keep housing prices high (that is what \"support the housing markets\" means), they are not staying high. That bad MBS paper did not disappear, the fed backstopped it. What do you think is going to happen this time around when disposable income goes negative.\n \n It just kills me that those effing retards at the fed and in the government could not see the problems that we were talking about here 3 years before the freaking crash AND the mathematically inevitable outcome, but somehow they are the ones who are supposed to know how to fix them? Are these people in league with the devil???? \n \n America SHOULD BE a wealthy enough country that our people do not have to starve but these fools in washington are just hell bent on that being the outcome for much of the middle class and it god damn XXXXXX me off.",

   "Far from fixing the housing market problem we have extended it into the food market by allowing food futures to be traded on as derivatives, artificially raising certain food prices by speculation. The nub of that problem is that when Goldman Sachs makes a profit, people around the world die of starvation.\n\n \n Yes and no. While I do think that there have been some speculative increases in food prices in the past, and that the overall prices are generally higher because of how grains are traded, I do think that the last couple of food price spikes have been largely based in fundamentals. Prices for fuel and fertilizer (an oil product) have gone through the roof, whihc has a significant impact on what we grow, what it costs to grow it, and transport costs for the final product. \n \n IMO the biggest problem with food prices has been farm subsidies. In the US, that has led to inefficient farms staying in business when they should have gone under and been absorbed by more efficient operators. Part of that, though, is also our tax policy in agricultural states and the low level of property taxes on agricultural land, if they are not exempt entirely. Nobody like property taxes, but they do encourage efficient use of land. If it does not cost you anything to own it, haying a parcel that should be planted in wheat is fine.",
