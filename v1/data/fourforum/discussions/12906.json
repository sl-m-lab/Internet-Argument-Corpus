   "The city of Chicago, under advisement of one of those pointy-headed School of Chicago economists, decided to privatize their parking meters.\n \n The parking rates were increased fourfold.\n \n Secondly, the meters were not maintained, it's not cost-effective and hurts the profit margin if you do stupid stuff like that.\n \n Certain turnpikes were privatized.\n \n Same deal. Increase in rates, pike maintenance is abandoned.\n \n Clever move, Milton Friedman bozos!",

   "Simone is once again rambling off what S/He read on The Huffington Post this morning. Like everything on that website it misleads the reader and makes people like Simone come up with conclusions that are baseless.\n \n Let's examine.\n \n The full report done by the inspector general can be read here: http://www.chicagoinspectorgeneral.org/pdf/IGO-CMPS-20090602.pdf\n Here are a few of the GAO reports mentioned:\n http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d081052t.pdf\n http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d081149r.pdf\n \n As noted in both in BOTH reports, PPPs can provide great benefit to government as is done in Europe and Australia but it has to be done correctly. Chicago is famous for boneheaded policies and this is just another one of them.\n \n The parking rates were increased fourfold.\n Actually they will increase over the next 4-5 years at a total of 400% from 2008 rates. This was agreed upon by the city and was not a surprise.\n \n Secondly, the meters were not maintained, it's not cost-effective and hurts the profit margin if you do stupid stuff like that.This was shortly after they took over and the city had to repair the meters. The city simply billed the company for failure to obey the contract. The city made a terrible deal in terms of maintaining these things but the only hurt folks here is the company...they lost money. On the plus side the meters are ALL being renovated with credit card pay boxes (as seen in DC and other localities). So the broken meter problem is going away anyway.\n \n Certain turnpikes were privatized.\n Same deal. Increase in rates, pike maintenance is abandoned.Yes, tolls increased per the agreements but NO mention of maintenance being abandoned. In fact, all the agreements I read require STRICT maintenance including road smoothness and safety features. Furthermore, in Australia and Europe it has shown that companies will provide a better service so they can get more money (such as smart tag lanes). \n \n The GAO found that if the government doesn't act like a fool, these agreements can help out both parties. Sadly the Chicago Council is filled with people who couldn't pass third grade math and they got ripped big time. Morgan Stanley wins and Chicago fails...is that the fault of privatization or once again a terrible government? I'd say terrible government.",
