   "Copts Release Video of Mass Rioting, Destruction of Churches and Bibles; Fear Impending Ethnic Cleansing of Christians in Egypt \n Thu Oct 27, 9:27 AM ET \n \n \n \n \n To: National and International Desks, Religion Reporter \n \n \n Contact: Maria Sliwa of Freedom Now Communications, 973-272-2861 or SliwaNews@gmail.com \n \n \n \n \n UNION CITY, N.J., Oct. 27 /U.S. Newswire/ -- Fearing a repeat of the recent riots against the Coptic Church in Alexandria, Egypt which left four dead, over 80 wounded and seven churches defaced, the International Christian Union (ICU) and American Coptic Association (ACA) are calling on the U.S. Government and the United Nations to take immediate action to stop the bloodshed and destruction of churches.\n \n \n \n \n Exclusive video footage released by the ICU/ACA today, on http://mychristianblood.blogspirit.com reveals the destruction of the Assemblies of God Church for Evangelical Copts in Moharam Bek, on Friday, Oct. 21.\n \n \n \"We are receiving numerous reports that extremist Muslim groups are planning to surround the Alexandria churches again on Friday, Oct.28, and at the end of Ramadan on the following Tuesday, promising the death of Christians and the continued destruction of churches throughout Egypt,\" Dr. Monir Dawoud, president of the ICU/ACA, said.\n \n \n Dawoud faults the security forces for encouraging violence by first \"giving the green light to the mob,\" and then failing to control the resulting riots. \"If the momentum of the riots is allowed to continue, the crowds will be impossible to contain,\" Dawoud said.\n \n \n Over 5,000 Muslims demonstrated outside of the Alexandria Coptic Orthodox Church last Friday to protest the production of a drama staged at the church two years ago. The protestors say the play blasphemes Islam. According to recent statements by the Coptic Church, however, the play does not defame Islam.\n \n \n \"Copts and other minorities in Egypt are continually subjected to physical and verbal harassment by extremist Muslim groups. Yet we do not destroy their houses of worship or call for bloodshed,\" said Amgad Zakhari, one of the youth leaders with the ICU/ACA.\n \n \n In addition to the protests, the Egyptian newspaper, El Fagr, published threats made by Muslim radicals against the Coptic Pope Shenouda III. According to this report, Muslim radicals publicly announced their threats through mosques in the outskirts of the city of Alexandria and were calling for the death of the Pope in revenge for an alleged insult to Islam's prophet. \n \n \n The ICU and the ACA are planning a demonstration in front of the UN next week to protest the persecution of Christians in Egypt.\n \n \n \n http://news.yahoo.com/s/usnw/20051027/pl_usnw/copts_release_video_of_mass_rioting__destruction_of_churches_and_bibles__fear_impending_ethnic_cleansing_of_christians_in_egypt\n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1214\n \n Egyptian Progressive Author Calls To Confront the Intolerance Toward the Copts \n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1150\n \n Religious Tension Rises In Egypt After Years of Calm \n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/1062\n \n Islamic Honesty and Honor \n \n \n \n See also: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/khilafism/message/771\n \n Tolerance and Pluralism in Islam?

It was the last large-scale conflict where armies had no supply trains and supported themselves by local foraging (i.e., looting); any squad of thugs could pass themselves off as part of an army and, for the folks who keep any society going, it was like being back in the Dark Ages of a thousand years earlier. The final peace treaty was signed at Westphalia in 1648 and settled a lot of issues: The Holy Roman Empire granted Catholic and Protestant states equality within its realm, Spain and the Netherlands ended their \"eighty years war,\" the concept of national sovereignty was born, and the Swiss promised to quit furnishing mercenaries (except as bodyguards to the Pope). The treaty was the beginning of the end for the conflict between Catholics and Protestants, and the temporal influence of the clerics began a decline which seems to continue even today.",
