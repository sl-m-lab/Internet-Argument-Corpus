   "Stephanie Smith, a children's dance instructor, thought she had a stomach virus. The aches and cramping were tolerable that first day, and she finished her classes.\n \n Then her diarrhea turned bloody. Her kidneys shut down. Seizures knocked her unconscious. The convulsions grew so relentless that doctors had to put her in a coma for nine weeks. When she emerged, she could no longer walk. The affliction had ravaged her nervous system and left her paralyzed.\n \n Ms. Smith, 22, was found to have a severe form of food-borne illness caused by E. coli, which Minnesota officials traced to the hamburger that her mother had grilled for their Sunday dinner in early fall 2007.\n\n http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/04/health/04meat.html\n \n Oook!\n \nGround beef is usually not simply a chunk of meat run through a grinder. Instead, records and interviews show, a single portion of hamburger meat is often an amalgam of various grades of meat from different parts of cows and even from different slaughterhouses. These cuts of meat are particularly vulnerable to E. coli contamination, food experts and officials say. Despite this, there is no federal requirement for grinders to test their ingredients for the pathogen.\n \n The frozen hamburgers that the Smiths ate, which were made by the food giant Cargill, were labeled \"American Chef's Selection Angus Beef Patties.\" Yet confidential grinding logs and other Cargill records show that the hamburgers were made from a mix of slaughterhouse trimmings and a mash-like product derived from scraps that were ground together at a plant in Wisconsin. The ingredients came from slaughterhouses in Nebraska, Texas and Uruguay, and from a South Dakota company that processes fatty trimmings and treats them with ammonia to kill bacteria.\n \n\n Wooh! Ammonia is ever so tasty in your burger!\n \n I grew up on a farm and I do love my beef. But, sometime during the Reagan Administration I had to stop eating commercially ground hamburger, even that labeled super low fat, because when I pan-grilled the meat it smelled like cow manure -- and I knew the meat had not been properly handled.\n \n Believe me, I know what cow manure smells like.\n \n American meat is totally filthy!",

   "How can I keep from getting E. coli infection?\n You can help prevent this infection by handling and cooking meat in a safe way. For your protection, follow these rules:\n \n \n Wash your hands carefully with soap before you start cooking. \n Cook ground beef until you see no pink anywhere. \n Don't taste small bites of raw ground beef while you're cooking. \n Don't put cooked hamburgers on a plate that had raw ground beef on it before. \n Cook all hamburgers to at least 155\u00b0F. A meat thermometer can help you test your hamburgers. \n Defrost meats in the refrigerator or the microwave. Don't let meat sit on the counter to defrost. \n Keep raw meat and poultry separate from other foods. Use hot water and soap to wash cutting boards and dishes if raw meat and poultry have touched them. \n Don't drink raw milk. \n Keep food refrigerated or frozen. \n Keep hot food hot and cold food cold. \n Refrigerate leftovers right away or throw them away. \n People with diarrhea should wash their hands carefully and often, using hot water and soap, and washing for at least 30 seconds. People who work in day care centers and homes for the elderly should wash their hands often, too. \n In restaurants, always order hamburgers that are cooked well done so that no pink shows. \n \n From Familydoctor.org\n \n \n \n Cooking the beef well will kill e coli",
