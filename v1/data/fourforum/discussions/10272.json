   "How can evil ever overcome a message of Love? Because it happens all the time throughout the history of our world.\n \n People kill in the Name of Jesus, Ghandhi, Buddha. It wouldn't surprise me to find out people kill for pacifism.\n \n How can evil people get this done?\n \n Rules for a devil.\n \n 1. Never attack the message, embrace it.\n \n 2. Relay a special love for the message, as if you own the message.\n \n 3. Slowly distort your enemies view of the message.\n \n 4. Convey a sense of danger to the message from your enemies.\n \n 5. Point out flaws in your enemy even if the bad deeds are conducted by an individual.\n \n 6. Have confidence your followers (yours now) can overcome your enemies.\n \n 7. Give a sense of urgency to defense of the message.\n \n Evil doesn't even have to order an attack or harm. Evil feeds itself. A positive feedback loop has begone in both evils followers and the enemy.\n \n Turning the other cheek is right. In engineering terms, this is called negative feedback. You do the opposite of what you want to regulate.",
