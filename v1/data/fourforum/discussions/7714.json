   "1. In a capitalist nation, modern war makes money for private enterprise, liberal and conservative, at public cost. WW2 was the last war where profit was realized by the conquerers. \n \n 2. I can't answer that. The UK takes US policy direction (empire guilt?), but I'm not familiar with their popular position on Israel. Other than perhaps the UK, I don't recall anyone but the US standing up for the long history of Israeli terrorism for financial and real estate gain from Palestine. \n \n 3. Even US deemed 'bad' countries like China and Russia aren't stupid enough to destroy the entire infrastructure of desired real estate with no return on investment.",

   "1. Would someone please tell me what war the United States has fought in during modern times that the conservatives as a group were against?\n\n \n WWII-pre Pearl Harbor\n \n\n 2. Would someone please tell what nation of people support the current policies of the State of Israel beside the United States?\n \n\n It depends on the issue. For example, Australia and some Pacific Rim countries joined the US in voting in favor of Israel's security fence.\n \n\n 3. What other nation could make a unilateral preemptive military attack on another nation and it would be acceptable? \n \n\n France's action in the Ivory Coast comes immediately to mind. I know there are other examples.\n \n My advice to you, don't fish if you don't want to catch anything. :)",

   "Also WWI pre-1917. Once we're in though, conservatives like to cheerlead because they think it's patriotic.\n \n Didn't we make a handsome profit from the first Gulf War?",
