   "At his terrible death, the sun proclaimed his divinity by hiding it's face. \n \n Who are we talking about? None other than Julius Ceasar. \n \n Pliny the Elder wrote - \" Portentous and protracted eclipses of the sun occur, such as the one after the murder of Caesar the dictator and during \n the Antonine war which caused almost a whole years continuous gloom.\n \n Josephus in Antiquites 19, wrote that Mark Anthony proclaimed \n \"\"...for the sake of which we suppose that it was that the sun turned away his light from us,\n as unwilling to view the horrid crime they (the assassins) were guilty of in the case of Caesar\" \n \n Plutarch, in the \"Life of Julius Caesar\" wrote \n \"The brightness of the Sun was darkened, which all through the year rose very pale and shined not out, \n whereby it gave but little heat. Wherefore the air was rather cloudy and dark by reason of the heat that could not come forth,\n causing the earth to bring forth but raw and unripe fruit, which rotted before it could ripen.\" \n \n And of course, Virgil Wrote (Georgic 1, v 466)\n \"The sun, too, pitied Rome when Caesar died, and hid its shining face in dim dusty red, and that impious generation feared eternal night.\" \n \n The story about Jesus and the sun was merely showing Jesus was a Caesar wanna be.",
