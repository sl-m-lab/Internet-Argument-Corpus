   "All those callous people who justify their enthusiasm for torture saying that it is to obtain information to protect the rest of us ought to read the article below. \n But perhaps I am wrong, they are sadists who hide their cruelty and lack of compassion for other fellow beings behind a lie, an invalid excuse. They are autistic when it comes to the suffering of others. Sad, very sad cases.\n \n But just in case read this:\n \n Torture in theory:\n \n Fran\u00e7ois Marie Arouet was born in 1694 when the Old Regime seemed impervious to change. Writing under the name Voltaire, Arouet was an important figure in the development of modern Western ideas about government and justice.\n Voltaire&#8217;s mantra throughout his long life was the phrase &#8220;\u00c9crasez l&#8217;inf\u00e2me&#8221;. &#8220;Wipe out this infamy - just erase it entirely.&#8221; One infamy Voltaire had in mind was the government practice of torture in France.\n One of the cases that most profoundly disturbed Voltaire was the brutal execution of the regicide Damiens. Michel Foucault wrote about this event, and used it as emblematic of the medieval world. Under the ancien r\u00e9gime, the power of the state was absolute, exercised through public spectacles and private terrors. Torture was a way of demonstrating that spectacular power.\n But perhaps we have written off the ancien r\u00e9gime too quickly. Earlier this year, Professor Mirko Bagaric and Julie Clarke of Deakin University Law School argued that torture is a &#8220;permissible&#8221; and &#8220;moral&#8221; action in certain circumstances. Peter Faris, one-time head of the now defunct National Crime Authority, supported the call. Government sanctioned torture is back on the agenda.\n This issue is by no means hypothetical. The Bush administration insists on its right to act as it sees fit in the &#8220;war on terror&#8221;, including the use of torture, and unconstrained by either domestic or international law. The Working Group Report on Detainee Interrogations in the Global War on Terrorism (pdf file 6.62MB) argues that the president&#8217;s &#8220;ultimate authority&#8221; in a time of self-proclaimed and self-defined war is not inhibited by any laws, even against torture. Alberto Gonzales advised that the &#8220;new paradigm&#8221; of counter-terrorism &#8220;renders obsolete Geneva [Convention]&#8217;s strict limitations on questioning of enemy prisoners and renders quaint some of its provisions&#8221;.\n Bagaric and Clarke ignore this social context. Torture, they say, is only justifiable where &#8220;torturing a wrongdoer... is the only means, due to the immediacy of the situation, to save the life of an innocent person&#8221;. Indeed, they allow that no such circumstance may ever arise. Thus, their argument is presented as if it were a harmless thought experiment. It is not. The use of arguments like those of Bagaric and Clarke to justify ever-expanding practices of torture is not a possibility but a fact, engineered, according to US government sources, as part of &#8220;a calculated effort to create an atmosphere of legal ambiguity&#8221;. These Australian academics are seriously implicated in the creation of that atmosphere.\n Even if we take Bagaric and Clarke&#8217;s very modest proposal for torture at face value, it is implicated in the real-world practices they disavow. Torture by its very nature deals with uncertainty: ignorance is the problem that it claims to solve by violence. Yet torture produces such exceptionally unreliable information that it is thought to be largely useless. All Western legal systems acknowledge this by excluding as unreliable the fruit of torture. But the authors provide us with no evidence to support their odd assumption that torture produces enough reliable information, enough of the time, to justify it.\n Now let us look at the problem of ignorance and uncertainty from the torturer&#8217;s point of view. A licenced torturer cannot know that a supposed terrorist (for example) is the only way to locate a bomb; or that there is a bomb; or that he will tell the truth; or even that he is a terrorist. When exactly do we believe what the victim is telling us when the justification of torture is precisely that we only believe them when they tell us what we want to know, without already knowing it? There is a paradox here which must lead to the kind of grey areas or &#8220;slippery slope&#8221; that Bagaric and Clarke attempt unsuccessfully to exclude. The authors explicitly concede that their modest proposal may not lead to torture that saves a life. But they don&#8217;t tell you the logical corollary: it will lead to torture, and therefore by their own reasoning it will lead to torture that does not save a life.\n \n Torture in practice :\n \n It is duplicitous to describe torture, as Bagaric and Clarke do, as &#8220;inflicting a relatively small level of harm on a wrongdoer&#8221;. It is appalling that these lawyers trivialise the very practice they advocate. How effective would a regulated, prescribed and &#8220;relatively small&#8221; dose of torture be? Many of us can tolerate a finite dose of pain, even if it is severe. The power of torture comes instead from the promise that the pain will never end until you talk. It is a logical contradiction to imagine that torture can be regulated because it is part of its essence that the victim is powerless and that resistance is futile. Torture gets people to talk (not, of course, to tell the truth, but certainly to talk) if and only if the torturer is sovereign.\n Neither can we limit our analysis to one individual. Torture is used to terrorise whole communities. Just like Damiens, torture demonstrates the random and unstoppable power of the state to destroy lives, and consequently it instils an intense sense of vulnerability in whole populations. Ultimately the powerlessness it communicates shifts from passivity to rage. The turning point in the lives of many Al-Qaida operatives was their imprisonment and torture in Egyptian, Syrian and other Middle Eastern prisons: this same Egypt to which the United States still &#8220;renders&#8221; suspects in order to soften them up. This is one reason that there is a growing suspicion that the prisoners in Guantanamo Bay - part of the &#8220;gulag of our times&#8221; - can never now be released. Torture produces terrorists.\n \n Defending it :\n \n For the sake of argument let us look a little closer at the ways in which Bagaric and Clarke attempt to defend an entitlement to torture. According to Bagaric and Clarke, the illegality of torture has only driven it &#8220;beneath the radar screen of accountability;&#8221; legalisation might &#8220;reduce the instances of it.&#8221; But our societies are not without experience of legal torture. Was there less of it then? Were torture done in public, were it supervised by a medical practitioner in a hygienic environment, were it made respectable - would any of this make torture better? Once again Voltaire comes to mind: &#8220;If we believe absurdities, we shall commit atrocities.&#8221;\n The centre-piece of Bagaric and Clarke&#8217;s defence argues by analogy to &#8220;the right of self-defence, which of course extends to the defence of another&#8221;. Just as we are entitled to respond with violence to a murderous attack, they say, we are entitled to protect others: if the only way to protect them is by torturing somebody for information, then torture must be legitimate too. But the analogy falls down in at least three ways. First, the principle of self-defence recognises a reality: when it&#8217;s &#8220;him or me&#8221; a law that said I could not respond to an attacker would be simply unenforceable. Here the violence of torture is a choice deliberately made and carried out, and not purely responsive.\n Second, their analogy assumes the only point it needs to prove. One can legally defend oneself; but what legal system has ever authorised a case of torture &#8220;in self-defence&#8221;? In the United States, and in fact throughout the world, it is generally considered worse to torture than to kill. Bagaric and Clarke think it obvious that if we can kill in self-defence, therefore we can torture. They assert their position as self-evident. It is nothing of the kind.\n Third, self-defence is about individual action, torture is about government action. There is a profound difference between the two. Government action - law - carries a mark of legitimacy with it. Self-defence is not the same as a government program which institutionalises and legitimises torture. No matter how limited, torture is thereby made right in a way that no act of personal self-defence ever makes murder right.\n So too, the reach and mechanisms of government power make torture a weapon from which no member of a community will feel immune. If the state could torture any one of us, what sort of a society would we live in? Bagaric and Clarke imply that torture would only affect those who deserved it. They insist that it is &#8220;verging on moral indecency...to favour the interests of wrongdoers over those of the innocent&#8221;. The word &#8220;wrongdoer&#8221; is another question-begging term, since the authors assume that we know who they are. But any torture that takes place will probably precede a trial that might establish whether or not they are innocent. So much for the rule of law: another suspicion has been magically converted into a certainty....\n \n For a complete text go to:\n Torture produces terrorists - On Line Opinion - 28/11/2005",

   "those who want to strip eventually individuals of all of their rights such as Dubya and his cronies tried hard to do so. First they violated the human rights of foreigners and to make sure that US law could not protect them, they &#8220;renditioned&#8221; them and later sent them to a foreign outpost Guant\u00e1namo. The next step would have been to extend this violations of human rights in the mainland to US citizens all in the name of protecting the people from &#8220;terrorists&#8221;.\n &#8216;The end justify the means&#8217; was the moral principle that the conservatives used, i.e. consequentialism. But to the American people torture was too much, no matter what the end was and thus the Bush Administration was forced to re-define the meaning of the word.\n The article I quoted above, proves conclusively that torture can never be justified, that just the fact of consider using it is morally obscene.\n But there are people who can no connect with the suffering of others and for them any mean is justifiable. These are the people who also think that they will never be tortured so as long as it happens to others is OK with them.\n They are evil people, as simple as that. Glad to see you are not one of them.",

   "Have any of you guys seen the documentary on Abu Ghraib torture, where they interviewed some of the people who committed the torture (and were seen in those pictures)?\n It's rather eye-opening. It's rather obvious that the guys involved didn't know what they were doing. From words coming out of these people's mouths, you can see the \"torture\" was more an emotional response to the threat that they saw for their military buddies in the field, than it was an actual intelligent approach. There was one discussed case where the prisoner being tortured stated he WOULD answer the question, but the torturer continued the torture, without even bothering to ASK the question to get the answer.\n In fact, they had people who are paid interrogators at the camp who were appalled by the practices, and openly stated \"torture does not work\".\n \n People talk about it like it's the penultimate way to get information, but it's not.\n \n \nHere's a former FBI interrogator -- who interrogated Al Quaeda suspects -- saying categorically that torture does not help collect intelligence, but that it does sell impressionable people on the legitimacy of jihad, on the grounds that a regime that tortures deserves to be attacked. \n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsvO9kvSdoFormer FBI Interrogator Jack Cloonan explains that regular interrogation tactics work well on even the worst terrorists, that there's no such thing as a \"ticking timebomb\" scenario, and that waterboarding has done much more harm than good. \n Update: From the comments, TCD004 sez,\"Thanks for the link to our video.

I think we know the answer...\n\n Again, it's flawed to offer only two options.\n If you ask: 1) water boarded, 2) head chopped off, or 3) Geneva Convention rules observed, I think we know the answer.\n \n \n \nMy solution...do it like police do TASERS. If you are going to use a technique you must first go through it yourself... If that applied to both sides we'd have less heads rolling around in exchange for some coughing\n\n With the police, we still have to observe constitutional rights for even Charlie Manson.\n Our Declaration of Independence talks about \"all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights\".\n Now, I'm not saying that means we shouldn't kill the terrorist bleeps that are trying to kill us on the battle field.\n What I am saying is that mentality is present in the Geneva Convention, which America shouldn't arbitrarily throw out the window based on presidential administration secret meetings.\n \n Moreover, the Navy Seals used to have waterboarding in their training techniques. They abandoned the practice because the trainees would always break and it was too demoralizing. The Seal training still goes through some pretty incredible stuff, but waterboarding was deemed too much.\n On another level, I would be interested in people having to go through the technique first. Too many pundits out there trying to speak on the issue based on their political idealogy, ignoring what people who have actually gone through this have had to say.\n McCain went through torture. He doesn't support it. (Not sure if that fully changed in his presidential bid, but that's a different issue.)\n \n \n \nI've never seen a video of Russians cutting Pearl's head off or flying planes into NYC. That said, I'm sure both sides did some nasty stuff to each others agents and both sides misunderstood a lot about each other.

I don't think someone is Evil because they are Muslim (my first wife was Muslim)...I think they are evil if they want to kill someone because they are Western or Shiite or whatever.\n\n I can agree with the definition.\n The trick then becomes trying to figure out how many actually want to \"kill someone because they are Western or Shiite or whatever\".\n \n American government own research demonstrates that our war efforts in Iraq have INCREASED terrorism, because of Islam's perception of the invasion. The increase was not due to people who just wanted to \"kill someone because they are Western or Shiite or whatever\". It was based on a reaction to America's invasion of Arab land.\n The later interrogator author explicitly stated that there was a surgence in al Qaeda membership based on Islam finding out about our treatment of Muslims.\n \n \n \nI agree with this to a very large extent. Which is why there should be oversight at the highest levels.\n\n I agree.\n \n \n \nLet's turn that around...if water boarding or sleep depo never worked why would anybody (Professional Interrogators actually) use it?\n\n 1) I hate to reference a documentary, but if you had seen the abu Ghraib documentary where they interview the actual people seen in those pictures, it would answer your question in part. These guys were NOT \"professionals\". Quite frankly, it resembled something more along the lines of \"Lord of the Flies\".\n A lot of the torture usage is not done by \"Professional Interrogators\". Part of the reason why we need \"oversight at the highest levels\" on this.\n \n 2) I would be curious as to how many professional interrogators actually use water boarding.\n I can provide a variety of quotes from people who interrogate for a living, who condemn water boarding.\n \n 3) I don't believe water boarding \"never works\". \n And as for \"sleep depo\", I think some level of it is not torture. There are obviously other levels which would clearly be classified as torture.\n \n \n \nAgain, if they were sitting there burning them with cigarettes or raping them with broom handles I'd be first in like to punish the ones doing it. We are in a titanic Ideological struggle however, and there are bound to be causalities. I'd much rather be caught by OUR side than theirs.\n\n A link between our negative actions and an increase in the al Qaeda membership has been observed.\n From a practical perspective, I think we should stop trying to fix the dam by knocking more holes in it.\n \n I get tired of hearing the \"24\" scenario where Jack Bower has to do something extreme before the commercial break or else people will die.\n If a situation like that ever occurred, and torture were \"illegal\", I would acquit. A clear case of \"defense of others\" which would justify even murder.\n While I see a \"titanic ideological struggle\", we aren't on any brink whereby we have to resort to torture or we lose.\n \n \n \nNo, but we can't do NOTHING. They are the one's who want to 'cleanse the Earth' of us. We've never claimed to want to rid the Earth of all Muslims. You've got to see that in a war things get broken and people get hurt but there's a difference between how and why we fight to protect ourselves and the motivations and tactics of our enemies.\n\n I agree there are huge differences. We are definitely not at the level of bin Laden.\n But I don't think the average \"suicide bomber\" is on the level of bin Laden either. His organization is made up of self-enforced ignorance and artificial pictures of reasons to hate America.\n \n Yes. In war \"things get broken\".\n But we also still prosecute people for \"war crimes\" as well. History includes an example of America pursuing (and achieving) prosecution of a Japanese man for war crimes for waterboarding.\n There are still rules.\n \n \n \nSo there are degrees of torture. I admit some people truly believe that water boarding (or Streisand) is torture. I'd still pick that over anything the enemy is offering.\n\n We have more than two options.\n I would pick \"not waterboarding\" (allowing for an ACTUAL \"Jack Bower\" scenario which would need to exist, and not just conjured in our minds) over anything the enemy is offering and over \"controlled waterboarding\".\n \n \n \nI don't have access to the files obtained through it. But why would anyone insist (esp. in the face of such resistance) that it is necessary if it was worthless? If there's a better way, I'm all for it. No you can't torture someone into being on your team but you might find the bomb in time...Don't you watch 24 ;-)\n\n haha.\n I actually started the first season once. It actually annoyed me for a variety of reasons that had nothing to do with the story.\n \n I think under the Bush administration we had moments where truly the \"inmates\" were running the asylum. There were a variety of moves\n I would love an honest account of whether America has truly ever had a \"24\" moment. I would truly consider it \"defense of others\" with a REAL and ACTIVE threat.\n But I honestly don't think we've ever had that. I believe the previous administration chose what they saw as an easier path for a self-induced perception of importance.\n The credibility of the previous administration suffers when they do things like blatantly lie about whether or not we have tortured in the first place...\n \n I hate to say it, but I think part of the issue boils down to what is \"necessary\".\n Suppose we say the terrorist detainee would not give up his information without torture. Does that make torturing of him \"necessary\" to obtain that information?\n In a \"Jack Bower\" immediate clear and present danger situation, I would say yes.\n But without that... If it's just cause the terrorist detainee has really good information? I say no.\n \n War is dirty, but it still has rules.\n If we are going to throw some of those out the window, we need to take a hard and long look about our reason, and the implications of that move.",

   "Another opinion", 
   "I think there are a few issues that need to be considered regarding the question of torture:\n \n 1. What are the advantages that a country gains in supporting torture, whether as a general policy or for limited cases?\n If a tortured subject does not know anything useful, then all that torture accomplishes, if the subject responds at all, is for the subject to falsely confess to charges or give false information in order for the pain to stop. This result is not only of no use to a country (outside of potential propaganda purposes in being able to falsely show the public a claimed perpetrator of a crime), but the misleading information can cause wasted effort and potentially lost lives. \n \n If a tortured subject does know something useful, then torture might cause the subject to reveal the useful piece of information - thus potentially saving a few to thousands of lives. However, the subject might also give misleading or false information, which takes time, wasted effort and potentially wasted lives to uncover.\n \n 2. What are the disadvantages that a country loses in supporting torture, whether as a general policy or for limited cases?\n First of all, the country loses the sense of the moral high ground and, therefore, a certain degree of trust from other countries and from large portions of its own population. The degree to which this happens probably depends on the degree to which the country practices torture. A high enough degree of distrust not only reduces the sense of freedom that a people feel in that country, but also can add to the ranks of the very enemy that the county is trying to fight. However, if torture is only kept to truly extreme and well-confirmed cases, then the degree of mistrust, with its resulting negative consequences, can be minimized.\n \n Also, when tortured subjects give false information, that loses time, effort, and potentially loses lives.\n \n 3. What are the alternatives to torture that might be effective?\n \n As was mentioned, rapport-building can often give the results that one wants - especially when dealing with those that are not the top-tear idealists but the rank-and-file that have themselves been manipulated, misled and used by their own leadership. However, often, the ones that know the most information are those that are hard-core idealists, know the reality of the enemy that they are dealing with, and hate us nonetheless. Many or most of those would probably not talk under a rapport-building method or might give false information.\n \n ------\n \n So, given the negatives of torture on a country's image and on the possibility of following wrong leads, I would think that the only situations in which a country might want to engage in torture would be to find highly critical information (ex. the location of a small nuclear device that a terrorist group has placed in Baltimore harbor), where the country has very firm evidence that the subject knows the answer and the country has a means to quickly determine whether or not the subject is lying. Then, and only then, might torture be worth it.\n \n On a last note, there is a great risk in introducing ANY torture exceptions in that certain politicians will take advantage of any existing laws to push their ideology to the fullest, while hiding it from the public - as Bush did. For example, apparently, the rendition policy was started under the Clinton presidency but only for extreme cases. Bush very much extended that policy to the point that it has come under the national and international spotlight. So, if one does allow for torture in extreme cases, I would think that it would be highly important to allow transparency about the methods and accountability if the methods are used unjustifiably.",

   "Any person who even consider to use torture for whatever that purpose may be, is morally deficient in my opinion. It is a person who obviously has lost his moral compass if he ever had one.\n Here we go again, the fallacy of the &#8220;ticking bomb&#8221; scenario.

Just a fantasy to justify torture.\n Torture kept to &#8220;truly extreme and well confirmed cases&#8221;, what do you mean by that?\n\n Take the world trade center massacre. Apparently, there was enough independent intelligence out there to show that something major was in the works. If we had found out ahead of time that Mohamed Atta was directly involved in the detailed organizing and we had captured him then, yes, if he did not reveal the information otherwise or if we could not get the information otherwise, then he could have been tortured to reveal the information, which would have stopped the effort in its tracks and, hopefully, allowed us to set up proper intelligence to prevent any such future event (ex. keeping track of foreign nationals learning to fly). If he had lied, then there is usually some part of the lie that is confirmable so we probably would have been able to catch that - especially if we had caught him early enough.\n \n Where does one draw the line of the extremeness of the case that would allow torture? That is a subjective decision but it should be an honest balance taking into account the loss of moral status of a country vs. the loss of lives. Handwavingly, I would say 100 lives - no (That is more of a typical day in the world of terrorism); 1000 lives or more - probably yes.\n \nWhen you are torturing someone is because you don&#8217;t know if what he knows is relevant or not, you have to check whatever &#8220;information&#8221; the victim tells you and against what? All you get is whatever you want to hear or the victim thinks it will help him survive and stop the unbearable pain (all for a good cause, right?) he is being sadistically subjected to. Therefore nothing is farther from reality that &#8220;truly extreme and well confirmed cases&#8221; except in the imagination of torture enthusiasts and the script writers of &#8220;24&#8221;.\n\n For better or for worse, apparently the Israeli's have foiled many a terrorist plot by just such methods. From http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/637293.stm: \"The report acknowledged that the security issues faced by the agents at the time were unprecedented, and that they succeeded in preventing a number of guerilla attacks.\" However, the Israelis don't exactly have a high moral stance and such tactics helped reduce their moral stance in the world. It is all a matter of balancing what a country loses in moral authority with what it gains. I personally have little sympathy for someone who is planning mass murder. However, I do have quite a lot of sympathy for someone who is innocent and is tortured until he admits false confessions or false information. I also have sympathy for the bit players that are drawn or manipulated into a conflict and, either way, wouldn't have much useful information to give. I think that there do exist occasions where we are very sure, based on confirmable evidence, of the role of a particular detainee and, for extreme cases (ex. World Trade Center), I would view it as being worth it to torture him for information if other methods don't work. However, once again, I would think that it is critical that no \"slippery slope\" happen that changes a situation allowed for extreme cases (as was the case under Clinton) into one which allows for torture for far less certain or important cases (as was done under Bush).",

I disagree that it is immoral under all circumstances.\n \n Perhaps to explore this, we could detail what, specifically, is immoral about torture? :\n \n Certainly, it is immoral to torment an innocent - forcing him to lie in order to escape the pain. We all agree about that and I am certainly advocating that, if we are to torture at all, we have to be very certain that the person is not an innocent. The Bush administration was certainly not careful enough.\n \n It is immoral to have very disproportionate punishment through torture for lesser offenses. This is where torture of the bit players often goes way over what they were actually guilty of.\n \n It is immoral to use torture to illicit false confessions since the only thing that can be gained is to use that confession as a propoganda tool to lead the public to falsely think that the perpetrator of a particular crime has been found and that itself is also highly immoral (lying to the public by their government).\n \n When torture is overused, it leaves the public in a state of fear and, through this fear, they are less likely to voice their legitimate concerns about their government - certainly an immoral act to impose such a state of mind on a government's citizenry. \n \n There are probably a few more I can rattle off.\n \n However, I don't see a clear immorality about torturing information out of someone like Mohamed Atta to save thousands of lives. You might rattle off grand proclamations against torture. However, what would SPECIFICALLY be immoral about that particular situation - i.e. torturing someone to save thousands?

Being opposed to the barbaric practice of torture was part of our nation&#8217;s foundations, as decreed by George Washington:\n \n Fearful cowards embrace torture.\n\n The founders never had to face the prospect of terrorism, as we face it today. Conflicts were between nations or, occasionally, by rebel groups within a country. Either way, they were wars between groups with leaders and a firm structure and home base that ended when the leaders capitulated or the home base was taken over. One had an opponent with whom one could negotiate, even while conflicts continued. Germany and the US certainly fought fiercely during World War II but the Geneva Convention was nominally practiced by both sides because both sides agreed to it. \n \n That is not the case with Terorrism. Terrorism is a completely different situation where there is no structure, generally no universally recognized leadership with whom one can negotiate and stop the terrorism. As long as it remains small scale, then I would say that the moral status that a country loses by participating in torture to prevent such lower level terrorism is worse than what the country gains through using torture. However, the World Trade Center massacre and the continually discussed prospects of dirty bombs or, in worst case, suitcase sized nuclear bombs leaves the potential costs of terrorism just too high to ignore the possibility of using torture as a means to stop such worst cases. \n \n Again, I am not advocating torture as a general method to stop any level of terrorism. I am only saying that, in a realistic appraisal, I would condone it if used only for the most extreme situations - on prisoners whose identity is certain, and whose role in a planned high level terrorist attack is certain, and only on terrorist attacks that are at extreme levels (such as the World Trade Center) that would kill thousands. Certainly, I would think it unacceptable if used on typical prisonsers since, first, they would never deserve such treatment for the limited actions that they probably participated in; second, they probably know very little to begin with or nothing at all so one runs a high risk of torturing a relative innocent; and three, the loss of trust of a country that uses such torture outweighs any gain it would have. I don't believe that to be the case if one restricts its use to extreme cases only.\n \n From curiosity, if Mohamed Atta had been captured a few months before the World Trade Center massacre, and you knew for sure that you had the right man and that he was organizing a terrorist act on a very big scale (as he was) and that you couldn't get the information any other way, what would you do? Doing nothing or treating him like a regular prisoner would mean that the terrorist act would happen and thousands would be killed. Why, in that PARTICULAR situation, would you not consider torture? Is it fear of the slippery slope that you view that torturing one or a few could lead to a slippery slope of introducing a general policy of torture?",

Just an ambiguous comment on 'doing injury'.\n Knowing the period, I'd hazard a guess that Washington wouldn't consider 'waterboarding' to be injurious.\n \n And, since I'm not the lazy git who follows in Archy's foot steps and post a hacked quote, I'll post the original GEORGE WASHINGTON comment right HERE.\n \n \nCamp at Cambridge, September 14, 1775.\n \n Sir: You are intrusted with a Command of the utmost Consequence sequence to the Interest and Liberties of America. Upon your Conduct and Courage and that of the Officers and Soldiers detached on this Expedition, not only the Success of the present Enterprize, and your own Honour, but the Safety and Welfare of the Whole Continent may depend. I charge you, therefore, and the Officers and Soldiers, under your Command, as you value your own Safety and Honour and the Favour and Esteem of your Country, that you consider yourselves, as marching, not through an Enemy's Country; but that of our Friends and Brethren, for such the Inhabitants of Canada, and the Indian Nations have approved themselves in this unhappy Contest between Great Britain and America. That you check by every Motive of Duty and Fear of Punishment, every Attempt to plunder or insult any of the Inhabitants of Canada. Should any American Soldier be so base and infamous as to injure any Canadian or Indian, in his Person or Property, I do most earnestly enjoin you to bring him to such severe and exemplary Punishment as the Enormity of the Crime may require. Should it extend to Death itself it will not be disproportional to its Guilt at such a Time and in such a Cause: But I hope and trust, that the brave Men who have voluntarily engaged in this Expedition, will be governed by far different Views. that Order, Discipline and Regularity of Behaviour will be as conspicuous, as their Courage and Valour. I also give it in Charge to you to avoid all Disrespect to or Contempt of the Religion of the Country and its Ceremonies. Prudence, Policy, and a true Christian Spirit, will lead us to look with Compassion upon their Errors without insulting them. While we are contending for our own Liberty, we should be very cautious of violating the Rights of Conscience in others, ever considering that God alone is the Judge of the Hearts of Men, and to him only in this Case, they are answerable. Upon the whole, Sir, I beg you to inculcate upon the Officers and Soldiers, the Necessity of preserving the strictest Order during their March through Canada; to represent to them the Shame, Disgrace and Ruin to themselves and Country, if they should by their Conduct, turn the Hearts of our Brethren in Canada against us. And on the other Hand, the Honours and Rewards which await them, if by their Prudence and good Behaviour, they conciliate the Affections of the Canadians and Indians, to the great Interests of America, and convert those favorable Dispositions they have shewn into a lasting Union and Affection. Thus wishing you and the Officers and Soldiers under your Command, all Honour, Safety and Success, I remain Sir, etc.\n\n \n WOW!\n \n Nothing about actual 'prisoners' but, fellow subjects of an evil empire...Britain.\n Those are the ones you're not to hurt...because they are potential allies and often, nothing more than dupes. \n Bystanders...NOT 'prisoners (of war)'\n \n Now, pardon me a sec.\n \n \n BuwaHahahahhahahhahahahhahahhahahahhahahahhahah!\n \n Next time you see \"...\" and [***] in a quote...wonder really hard...what's being hacked and what's being paraphrased.

   "You have each avoided answering my question since you know full well that your pontifications are irrelevant in that particular situation (the case of a prisoner whose identity and role in planning mass murder of thousands is solidly confirmed and in which the information to stop the grand terrorist act cannot be garnered in any other way). As usual, you hide the fact that you have not thought out your positions and hide the holes in your arguement by throwing irrelevant insults instead of addressing the question. Are you so cowardly as to avoid answering such a simple question? You never know. If you actually HAVE an answer to that question then you might convince me or other readers that support torture in the very limited circumstances that I described. Either way, when you speak of Rummy's denial of torture, his smirk on his face, or those that enjoy torturing then I don't know who you are addressing here in this forum since I also agree to that. Rummy used torture as a general policy for a wide range of prisoners - which I am against. He denied its use - which I am against since I believe in transparency. I also think it despicable for people to enjoy torture. \n \n However, the one situation in which I would condone it, as I have said, is to get information out of individuals who are planning mass murder of thousands - whose identity and role are very well confirmed, and from whom the information cannot be gotten in other ways. I think that very few people have sympathy toward those who are planning mass murder. That is why you are such a coward in not addressing this issue since you know that you will be unconvincing.\n\n \n AO\n \n You are a na\u00efve Pollyanna and you are also a person that believes that the end justifies the means. I could write an essay about the immorality of it, but I couldn't be bothered. I can see you are resorting to insults calling me a coward. It doesn't bother me, I couldn't care less for your opinion of me.\n I am inserting this link not for you, but for whomever may read this thread and think that you may be right in thinking that torture, a mean no moral compassionate person would ever consider, produces results.\n Morality is not something that is pragmatic, morality is beyond expediency way beyond and persons such as you are morally short-sighted, therefore it is useless to point the immorality of their position. I feel sorry for people like you who are lacking in compassion and humanity (the Good side of humanity). You are blind and will never see the light.

Nobody ever questioned that so I don't know why you brought up that link since it is irrelevant to anything I am addressing. Over and over, you keep missing that point that, if we know for sure that a particular prisoner was planning a massive attack and we cannot get the information otherwise, then torture as a last resort might be necessary to save thousands of lives. Nobody here, certainly not I, is arguing for torture as it was practiced under the Bush administration - on prisoners whose identity was not certain, whose role was not certain, for any terrorist act - not just massive ones.\n \n You constantly seem to assume that because someone, such as myself (as well as respected individuals such as President Clinton), supports torture under extreme circumstances, that must mean that we support a wide range of torture and condone what was done under the Bush administration. If so, then it is clear that you either lack the ability or will to practice reading comprehension and your responses are based on knee-jerk emotionalism instead of rational arguement.\n \n Lastly, you keep avoiding giving an answer to the case that I posed (the only type of case where I would support torture), where:\n (1) The identity of the prisoner is solidly confirmed\n (2) The knowledge that he is organizing a massive terrorist act is solidly confirmed\n (3) The terrorist act being planned is on a massive scale (as with the World Trade Center)\n (4) The information, once retreived, can be verified\n \n Answer THAT case.

We call that propaganda.\n Towards civilians and towards those who really have no value.\n A common soldier or mercenary would have little knowledge of anything.\n Higher ranking officers 'may' have something worth interrogating them for.\n They also have value as hostages and as people to be ransomed back in prisoner exchanges or, even as possible recruits to your own side.\n \n If, on the eve of a huge battle, a scout were to be caught, he would be interrogated. Such interrogations would involve what WE call torture now. Beatings and the like. But, not the elaborate use of thumbscrews or a rack (traditional torture).\n \n You must also remember that torture and beatings, were common practice to illicit confessions from criminals at the time...with little in the way of anyone thinking it was wrong.\n \n It was a violent world.\n \n Prisoners in the American Revolutionary War - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n There's a quick site to check to see how POW's were treated.\n Most Americas, it seems, were neglected and allowed to die by the 'Civilized' British army. \n \n HistoryLite.Com - Boyd-Parker Revolutionary War Torture Site - 1779 - History Uploads by Members\n Here's a site dealing with the torture of American soldiers at the time by Indian and British loyalist...for accurate information about an army's composition.\n \n Just as in this case, it's concievable that 'American revolutionaries' also engaged in the practice (on the local scale) to get information if possible.\n \n Scouting operations not only included looking at the lay of the land, checking to see if there were natural hazards, checking with the local populations for rumors of witnessed events, seeing if there are enemies nearby and what their disposition may be but ALSO capturing an enemy to take back for interrogation.\n \n This capturing of prisoners from the enemy side by US forces is commonly shown happening in many popular movies and shows dealing with war. \n The show, Band of Brothers, even depicts it.\n \n As for what interrogation entails...seriously...do you think people are going to tell you the disposition of their forces over tea and biscuits?\n \n \n What's going on is an effort to find out what IS 'torture.'\n And, it's quite clear there are many different, personal standards on what it is.\n Just like there is debate on when it could be considered the lesser of two evils when engaging in it.\n \n Personally, whenever I hear that a defendent in a trial is being offered a deal to rat out their co-defendants for better treatment...I believe it's a form of torture.\n \n \"You'll get it easy if you co-operate\"\n The alternative...\"You'll get it HARD if you don't.\"\n \n And having been in jail...I can personally atest that conditions inside are more 'torturous' than those outside.\n \n \n It's clear you believe in a moral absolute here...based on ideology.\n It's also clear that there is YOUR moral absolute...and is not universally reflected in the current times...or in times past...and I'd predict, times future too.\n Trying to make it so...well, that just makes you an Archy. emoticon_xangel",

   "From reading the postings about torture, the morality or immorality of it, not only in this thread but in others, it is clear that there are two kinds of persons in this sad world of ours: those who instantly recoil from torture and reject it outright, no matter what reason is given for it, and those for whom torture is just a tool and for some (the sadists among them) a form of pleasure.\n The only hope for us is that those persons belonging to the first group, write the Constitution, the laws that protect us and give us rights which enshrined in law are our only protection from the second kind.\n Dialogue between the two groups is impossible and so is changing sides.\n Most forums are places where deaf people talk and this one is no exception.\n \n I am disappointed but not surprised in Obama&#8217;s handling of the acts of torture committed under the previous administration. Obama is a soft guy, his softly softly approach can achieve so much but no more. At least he banned torture or so he says. I am not convinced the CIA will cease to torture people.\n \n Not to prosecute those involved in torture because they only followed orders, sets a precedent. \n We should remember that this was the defence put up by Nazi defendants at Nuremberg, and also in Japan by Imperial Army officers after WWII. It was not accepted then. It is accepted by the US Government now. One type of justice for the defeated another for the winners. Historically consistent.\n \n The lack of morals of the present day America is set here to stay. The present day US is not the US of the founding fathers. Those people were the offspring of the English and French Enlightenment.\n \n To say that those who engaged in torture only followed orders, and therefore can not be prosecuted, apart from being just an expedient excuse, raises the questions of who gave the orders, and why can&#8217;t those be prosecuted instead?\n \n Just asking",

   "Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was the mastermind behind the terrorist atrocities of Sept. 11, 2001. If U.S. intelligence operatives had spotted him in a remote area of Pakistan, and killed him with a Predator missile, most people would have said: \"That's justice.\" \n \n Instead, of course, KSM was captured in an urban area of Pakistan by U.S. intelligence operatives who then interrogated him -- including through use of the technique known as waterboarding -- thereby leaving him alive and eliciting from him information about other terrorist plots in which innocent Americans had been targeted. Why are so many people insisting that's an injustice, a scandal and a crime for which intelligence operatives and former government officials ought to be prosecuted? \n \n During a time of asymmetrical war, such questions deserve serious debate. But the current administration doesn't appear to have the patience and much of the mainstream media don't seem to have the interest. \n \n President Obama ordered a review of \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" (EITs) to determine which he would -- and would not -- authorize. Presumably, he'd want to know which techniques are (A) effective, and (B) not so brutal as to rise to the level of torture. But the President's decision to release -- against the advice of his CIA director and four former CIA directors -- top secret Justice Department memos on the interrogation program have rendered that study moot. \n \n On the same day those memos were released, Obama's national intelligence director, Admiral Dennis Blair, told colleagues in a private memo that the now banned EITs did indeed \"produce significant information that helped the nation in its struggle with terrorists.\" \n \n Over the weekend, the Washington Post ran a front-page piece on \"ethicists\" alleging that psychologists and physicians who supervised CIA interrogations \"broke the law and shame the bedrock ethical traditions of medicine and psychology.\" \n \n Left unexamined was the likelihood that these health professionals had been tasked with ensuring that interrogations did not cross reasonable legal, medical and ethical boundaries, did not reach the point that they would \"shock the conscience\" which, as former CIA Director Michael Hayden told Fox News' Chris Wallace, is the \"American standard\" for torture. Hayden added: \"You have to know the totality of circumstances in which something takes place before you can judge whether or not it shocks the conscience.\" \n \n Among the released memos is one from then-Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee emphasizing that waterboarding \"will be stopped if deemed medically necessary to prevent severe mental or physical harm.\" Another memo makes clear that supervising physicians were empowered to stop interrogations \"if in their professional judgment the detainee may suffer severe physical or mental pain or suffering.\" What's severe? Again, circumstances matter and judgments may differ. Attempting to criminalize such differences is appallingly unethical -- not least when done by people who call themselves \"ethicists.\" \n \n Former Justice Department attorney David Rivkin has pointed out that the EITs described in the memos had been adapted from a U.S. military training program \"used for years on thousands of American service members with the full knowledge of Congress.\" That meant also that there was a large body of information on which to draw regarding both the effectiveness and the physical/psychological impact of the techniques. \n \n What's more, extraordinary measures were taken to protect even the vilest subjects. Al-Qaeda terrorist Abu Zubaydah was slammed against only a flexible wall, with cushioning around his neck to prevent neck injury. In the end, he provided the intelligence used to capture KSM who in turn \"yielded critical information\" -- according to one of the released memos -- that helped foil additional terrorist plots including a \"Second Wave\" with Los Angeles as the target. \n \n Terrorists are not criminal defendants with a \"right to remain silent.\" They are not prisoners of war obligated only to recite only name, rank and serial number. They are \"not, in fact, people entitled to the protection of the Geneva Convention.\" Those are the words of Eric Holder, Obama's Attorney General (on CNN, January 2002) who added that had Mohamed Atta \"survived the attack on the World Trade Center, would we now be calling him a prisoner of war? I think not. Should Zacarias Moussaoui be called a prisoner of war? Again, I think not.\" \n \n Reasonable people ought to be able to reach consensus on a few key points: Harsh interrogation methods should be used only as a last resort. They should never be used for revenge, punishment or to force confessions. There should be no torture -- no hot pokers through the eyes, no pulling fingernails out with pliers. But a few nights of sleep deprivation? A few weeks of boredom? Scaring with caterpillars? Such techniques inflict \"stress and duress\" but they hardly \"shock the conscience\" -- especially when weighed against what ought to be the much more shocking prospect of letting hundreds, perhaps thousands, of innocent men, women and children be slaughtered. \n \n By all means, let's have a decent respect for the opinions of others. But let's not sacrifice a single American life to score public relations points in the cafes of Europe. Nor should we delude ourselves into believing that kinder, gentler American interrogations will prevent otherwise peace-loving Muslims from signing up to suicide-bomb kindergartens and saw off the heads of captured infidels. \n \n We should fight this war in as civilized a manner as possible -- understanding that this is a war against an enemy who is utterly ruthless and unscrupulous and who should not be permitted to prevail anytime, anywhere. \n ",

   "Putting nations to the torture test\n \n I suppose most of us wonder how principled we might be if ever put to the test. In the face of pressure, flattery or extenuating circumstances, would we be true to our deeply held values or rationalise the slippage?\n It is a question examined in the movie \"Good\" through the life of an enlightened academic in Hitler's Germany. The regime's appeal to his ego erodes the academic's disdain for the Fuhrer until, almost to his surprise, the day arrives when he is donning the uniform of an SS officer and reporting on the efficiency of concentration camps. For all its faults, the movie raises a fundamental issue about the need to uphold one's values when it counts, not just when it is comfortable to do so.\n As it is for individuals, so it is for governments. It is in extreme times that a country's values are put to the test. And nothing illustrates the gap between fine ideals and dirty reality more graphically than the United States' embrace of torture, revealed in four top-secret memos released by the Obama Administration this month.\n The Justice Department memos from 2002 and 2005 provided the legal framework for the CIA's use of torture of al-Qaeda and other suspects held at Guantanamo Bay and other secret detention centres.\n Top \"justice\" officials gave the legal imprimatur to the use of waterboarding, and the technique known as \"walling\", which involved slamming suspects into a specially built wall. Food deprivation, sleep deprivation, cramped confinement and placing insects in a confinement box with the detainee were among techniques the administration concluded were not \"cruel, inhuman or degrading\" under international law.\n The new memos reveal the extent of the torture. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the self-proclaimed planner of the September 11 attacks, was waterboarded 183 times. Waterboarding was also used 83 times on another al-Qaeda prisoner, Abu Zubaydah - not for 35 seconds as a CIA officer claimed two years ago. In the case of Zubaydah, he had already been co-operating with the FBI under standard interrogation and could tell them nothing more after his interrogation was ratcheted up to torture.\n It was the Australian, Mamdouh Habib, who alerted the world to the US torture regime at Guantanamo at a court hearing in December 2004. His lawyer, Joe Margulies, used the word \"torture\" for the first time in public, according to The Washington Post.\n Habib said he was tortured in Pakistan, then flown to Egypt where he was tortured for up to six months. He was hung by his arms from hooks, routinely beaten, taken to a small room that was slowly filled with water until it was just under his chin, and shocked with a cattle prod. On the basis of \"confessions,\" he was taken to Guantanamo, where he was abused again.\n Put to the test when it counted, the Howard government showed shocking indifference to Habib's plight. Despite Australia being a signatory to the UN Convention Against Torture, the Howard government evinced no concern about his torture claims, including the possible knowledge of Australian officials, but merely asked the US to investigate and accepted its denials.\n Habib was released in 2005, a few weeks before the US government was scheduled to answer a judge's questions about his torture allegations. The Howard government treated him like a pariah. The conservative Canadian government, in contrast, offered one of its citizens who had been similarly tortured $C12.5 million ($14.3 million) and an apology.\n Many people think torture permissible if it may save more lives than it harms. But they don't explain how torturers know if a terrorist has the information they seek or is telling the truth. Torture may never elicit the truth - just information the victim thinks the torturer wants. Others, like former attorney-general Philip Ruddock, quibble over the definition. He endorsed sleep deprivation as a legitimate interrogation technique, though the Australian Army - mindful of its soldiers abroad - said it was inhumane.\n Torture is morally abhorrent and ineffective. That is why about 150 countries are parties to the UN Convention Against Torture. Only barbaric countries stoop to torture chambers with their pre-Enlightenment sights, sounds and implements. Countries that torture lose their moral authority to criticise others' human rights records or to take the moral high ground if their own troops are tortured. It is not a price worth paying to secure convictions because in democracies evidence obtained from torture is suspect or inadmissible.\n The Rudd Government flagged last August it was giving consideration to enacting a comprehensive new torture offence. It is still under consideration.\n In banning the use of torture two days after having come to office, President Obama began to change the discourse that had made torture acceptable in some quarters. \"We are not ... going to continue with a false choice between our safety and our ideals,\" he said. And he added, \"We are willing to observe core standards of conduct not just when it's easy, but also when it's hard.\"\n There's the rub. This shameful episode in US history shows how easily adherence to principles of morality, decency and law are subverted when the going gets tough. Good people - and democratic governments, it turns out - can do very bad things.\n \n Adele Horin | CIA torture | Obama",

   "Torture is a no-brainer. It's terribly immoral, it's against international and national law, it's depreciates our moral standing and ability to criticize other nations, it depreciates the standing and standards of international law, it puts American soldiers and Americans abroad at risk, and trained interrogators say that it produces unreliable information. It doesn't even work.\n \n There are different kinds of torture, and some can be \"experienced first-hand\" to a certain extent by soldiers-in-training, while others can't be simulated at all because of the nature of the assault.\n \n You can have a martial arts training session, whereupon, someone simulates an attack. But it is not the same thing as actually being attacked. For example, in training with swords, someone is not going to really stab you.\n \n Stopping torture is a no-brainer, too. It has to come out in the open. No administration can deal with what appears to be the extent of the problem that's developed, with the Bush administration, short of support from the American public. \n \n Unfortunately, this too, puts Americans at risk. Which is partly where nay-sayers are coming from. But the Bush administration should have thought of that, to begin with. It's not like the torture has been a secret. Though some are shocked to know how extensively involved some others have been. Which is a matter of common sense, looking at work cultures and when people work closely together.\n \n But it WILL continue, if it doesn't come out in the open.\n \n Torture is the same, whether it's Chile or Abu G.

   "\"It's tough trying to please people who crave vengeance almost as much as Madame Defarge, the unsparing French revolutionary in Dickens' \"Tale of Two Cities.\" That's what Barack Obama found out last week -- and will find out next week and for weeks to come unless he settles once and for all that he will follow the practice of all his predecessors and not prosecute decision-makers in the previous administration. \n \n The Madame Defarges of the Democratic left want to see the guillotine flash down and heads roll. Specifically, they want to see the prosecution or impeachment of officials who approved enhanced interrogation techniques -- torture, in their view. \n \n The president, it appears, is of two minds. On April 16, he released memorandums from the Bush administration Office of Legal Counsel approving the interrogation methods and said that CIA interrogators relying on them would not be prosecuted. Also released was the partial text of a letter from Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair characterizing those memos as \"graphic and disturbing.\" \n \n Obama was criticized for revealing intelligence information useful to our enemies. \"Nobody should pretend,\" wrote Washington Post columnist David Ignatius, who approved of Obama's decision, \"that the disclosures weren't costly to CIA morale and effectiveness.\" \n \n On April 20, Obama journeyed to CIA headquarters and defended his decisions. But the Madame Defarges had their knitting needles out, hauling in petitions with 250,000 signatures and demanding blood. On April 21, Obama caved, saying that Bush administration officials who approved the methods could be prosecuted if the attorney general wanted to press the cases. He didn't give the Madame Defarges all they wanted, resisting Speaker Nancy Pelosi's call for a 9/11-type commission.\n \n It is an article of faith among the Madame Defarges that the interrogation techniques they consider torture didn't produce useful information. All along Obama tried to pay homage to this dogma. \n \n The text of Blair's letter released to the public carefully omitted his admission that \"high value information came from interrogations in which the methods were used.\" Just normal editing, said his spokesman. Yeah, sure. Nor has Obama showed any sign of agreeing to Dick Cheney's demand that the full results of the interrogations should be released. That might embarrass the Madame Defarges. \n \n Whence cometh the fury of these people? I think it arises less from revulsion at interrogation techniques -- who thinks that captured al-Qaida leaders should be treated politely and will then tell the full truth? -- than it does from a desire to see George W. Bush and Bush administration officials publicly humiliated and repudiated. Just as Madame Defarge relished watching the condemned walk from the tumbrel to the guillotine, our contemporary Defarges want to see the people they hate condemned and destroyed. \n \n It doesn't seem to matter to our Madame Defarges that it's not clear that Bush officials violated any criminal law. One of the core principles of our law is that criminal statutes must be construed strictly against the government. If the government wants to deprive someone of his liberty for doing something, it should be very specific about what that something is. This distinguishes our system from authoritarian and totalitarian regimes that demand, like Alice's Red Queen, \"verdict first, trial later.\" \n \n It also doesn't occur to the Madame Defarges of our times that revolutions like hers tend to devour their own. Robespierre followed Marie Antoinette to the guillotine not so many months later. Today we see Pelosi trying to explain how she was present at confidential briefings where the enhanced interrogation methods were described and did nothing to stop them from being applied. \n \n If there is going to be a \"truth commission\" -- a title that is redolent of Stalinist purges -- shouldn't she be one of the first to testify? As for Barack Obama, asked in a September 2007 if we should \"beat out of\" an al-Qaida higher-up details of an impending attack, he said \"there are going to be all sorts of hypotheticals, an emergency situation, and I will make that judgment at that time.\" So \"torture\" just might be OK under the right circumstances. \n \n In the meantime, Obama's appeasement of the Madame Defarges carries a political price. Pollster Scott Rasmussen reports that 58 percent of Americans believe his release of the CIA memos endangers national security. Show trials of Bush administration officials could raise that number. Appeasing the Madame Defarges may cost more than it is worth. \"\n \n Let the show trials begin! Off with their heads. ",

   "On September 11, 1973, just prior to the capture by the military of the Palacio de La Moneda (the presidential palace), while gunfire and explosions were clearly audible in the background, President Salvador Allende made what would become a famous farewell speech to Chileans on live radio, speaking of himself in the past tense, of his love for Chile and of his deep faith in its future. He stated that his commitment to Chile did not allow him to take an easy way out and be used as a propaganda tool by those he called \"traitors\" (accepting an offer of safe passage), clearly implying he intended to fight to the end.\n \n Shortly afterwards, Allende was dead. An official announcement declared that he had committed suicide with a machine gun, and an autopsy labelled his death as suicide. The weapon purportedly used by Allende to commit suicide was an AK-47 assault rifle given to him as a gift by Fidel CastroJames Whelan, Out of the Ashes: The Life, Death and Transfiguration of Democracy in Chile , 511-512 and 519-520.[*] and which bore a golden plate engraved \"To my good friend Salvador from Fidel, who by different means tries to achieve the same goals.\"\n \n This explanation is today widely accepted, even by his family and members of his own party, after decades of silence and pointing to the Military. This (now) general acceptance is based on statements given by two doctors from the Moneda Palace infirmary who witnessed the suicide: Dr. Patricio Guijon, who made a statement at the time, and Dr. Jose QuirogaEric Pape, Five Degrees of Exile, Los Angeles Times Magazine, 11 July 1999. Reproduced online as part of an archive of Pape's articles, accessed 22 September 2006. who only confirmed it many years later.\n \n Official version of the death\n At approximately 1:50 PM local time, President Allende ordered the defenders of the Moneda to surrender. The defenders then formed a queue from the second floor, down the stairs and onto the Morande street door. The president went along this queue, from the ground floor up the stairs, shaking hands and thanking everyone personally for their support in that difficult moment. After he finished, he directed himself toward the Independence salon, located in the north-east side of the Palace's second floor.\n \n At the same time, Dr. Patricio Guijon (a member of La Moneda's infirmary staff) decided to return upstairs to recover his gas-mask as a souvenir. He heard a noise, and opened the door of the Independence salon in time to see the president shoot himself with his AK-47 assault rifle. From the other side of the salon and through an open door Dr. Jose QuirogaPatricio Zamorano, Muerte de Allende: los testigos que quedaron fuera de la historia , La Opinion Digital, 11 September 2003. Accessed online 22 September 2006., Arsenio Poupin, a member of the cabinet, Enrique Huerta, a palace functionary, two detectives from the Presidential security detail, and some GAPs (Presidential Security) were able to see the moment of death, or arrive a few seconds afterwards, attracted by the noise.\n \n Witnesses\n All sources seem to agree that at least the following witnesses were present:\n \n Dr. Patricio Guijon - member of the Presidential Medical Staff - Survived\n \n Dr.Jose Quiroga - member of the Presidential Medical Staff - Survived\n \n Arsenio Poupin Oissel - Presidential Assesor and member of the cabinet - Executed a few days later\n \n Enrique Huerta Corvalan - Palace Intendant - Executed a few days later\n \n David Garrido - Detective (Presidential Security Detail) - Survived\n \n Ricardo Pincheira - Detective (Presidential Security Detail) - Survived\n \n Pablo Manuel Zepeda Camillieri - GAP (Presidential Security) - Survived\n \n Of these witnesses, only Dr. Guijon spoke about the events immediately after they happened, and was roundly vilified for doing so. Some sources misattribute Guijon's declarations to \"Allende's personal doctor\": Dr. Enrique Paris Roa, who was at La Moneda not on his professional role but as a member of Allende's cabinet. He does not appear to have made any such statement as he was executed shortly afterwards.Anne-Marie O'Connor, Out of the Ashes, Los Angeles Times 22 October 2000. Reproduced online on the site of Oberlin College professor Steven S. Volk, accessed 22 September 2006.The other witnesses kept silent until after the restoration of democracy in Chile, as they believed (according to their own statements) that to corroborate the version of a suicide would in some measure downgrade Allende's sacrifice and lend support to the military regime.\n \n \n Death of Salvador Allende profile.

   "The Obama administration has clung for so long to the Bush administration&#8217;s expansive claims of national security and executive power that it is in danger of turning President George W. Bush&#8217;s cover-up of abuses committed in the name of fighting terrorism into President Barack Obama&#8217;s cover-up.\n \n We have had recent reminders of this dismaying retreat from Mr. Obama&#8217;s passionate campaign promises to make a break with Mr. Bush&#8217;s abuses of power, a shift that denies justice to the victims of wayward government policies and shields officials from accountability.\n \n In Britain earlier this month, a two-judge High Court panel rejected arguments made first by the Bush team and now by the Obama team and decided to make public seven redacted paragraphs in American intelligence documents relating to torture allegations by a former prisoner at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. The prisoner, Binyam Mohamed, an Ethiopian-born British national, says he was tortured in Pakistan, Morocco and at a C.I.A.-run prison outside Kabul before being transferred to Guant\u00e1namo. He was freed in February.\n \n To block the release of those paragraphs, the Bush administration threatened to cut its intelligence-sharing with Britain, an inappropriate threat that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton repeated. But the court concluded that the actual risk of harm to intelligence-sharing was minimal, given the close relationship between the two countries. The court also found a &#8220;compelling public interest&#8221; in disclosure, and said that nothing in the disputed seven paragraphs &#8212; a summary of evidence relating to the involvement of the British security services in Mr. Mohamed&#8217;s ordeal &#8212; had anything to do with &#8220;secret intelligence.&#8221; \n \n The Obama administration has expressed unhappiness with the ruling, and the British government plans to appeal. But the court was clearly right in recognizing the importance of disclosure &#8220;for reasons of democratic accountability and the rule of law.&#8221; \n \n In the United States, the Obama administration is in the process of appealing a sound federal appellate court ruling last April in a civil lawsuit by Mr. Mohamed and four others. All were victims of the government&#8217;s extraordinary rendition program, under which foreigners were kidnapped and flown to other countries for interrogation and torture.\n \n In that case, the Obama administration has repeated a disreputable Bush-era argument that the executive branch is entitled to have lawsuits shut down whenever it makes a blanket claim of national security. The ruling rejected that argument and noted that the government&#8217;s theory would &#8220;effectively cordon off all secret actions from judicial scrutiny, immunizing the C.I.A. and its partners from the demands and limits of the law.&#8221; \n \n The Obama administration has aggressively pursued such immunity in numerous other cases beyond the ones involving Mr. Mohamed. We do not take seriously the government&#8217;s claim that it is trying to protect intelligence or avoid harm to national security. \n \n Victims of the Bush administration&#8217;s &#8220;enhanced interrogation techniques,&#8221; including Mr. Mohamed, have already spoken in harrowing detail about their mistreatment. The objective is to avoid official confirmation of wrongdoing that might be used in lawsuits against government officials and contractors, and might help create a public clamor for prosecuting those responsible. President Obama calls that a distracting exercise in &#8220;looking back.&#8221; What it really is is justice.\n \n In a similar vein, Mr. Obama did a flip-flop last May and decided to resist orders by two federal courts to release photographs of soldiers abusing prisoners in Afghanistan and Iraq. Last week, just in time to avoid possible Supreme Court review of the matter, Congress created an exception to the Freedom of Information Act that gave Secretary of Defense Robert Gates authority to withhold the photos. \n \n We share concerns about inflaming anti-American feelings and jeopardizing soldiers, but the best way to truly avoid that is to demonstrate that this nation has turned the page on Mr. Bush&#8217;s shameful policies. Withholding the painful truth shows the opposite. \n \n Like the insistence on overly broad claims of secrecy, it also avoids an important step toward accountability, which is the only way to ensure that the abuses of the Bush years are never repeated. We urge Mr. Gates to use his discretion under the new law to release the photos, sparing Americans more cover-up.\n \n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/26/opinion/26mon1.html",

It was the first such trial of US citizens in a foreign nation related to the now widely discredited secret rendition activities by the CIA, part of Mr Bush's so-called \"War on Terror\".\n \n While handing down the landmark convictions against the 23 defendants - all tried in absentia - Judge Oscar Magi dropped cases against three other Americans, including a former CIA Rome station chief. He also acquitted the former head of Italy's military intelligence, Nicolo Pollari, and his deputy, citing issues of diplomatic immunity and inadmissibility of evidence protected by secrecy laws.\n \n \n The harshest sentence, of eight years, was handed down to Robert Lady, the former Milan station chief for the CIA, who allegedly was at the heart of the operation that led to the seizing of Egyptian-born Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr, known as Abu Omar, in broad daylight. The court was told he was transferred first to Germany and later to Egypt for interrogation where he remained behind bars until 2007 without legal representation.\n \n As the world was to learn later, the fate of the cleric was hardly an isolated case. In multiple instances, some of which have since come to light, citizens were seized and secretly flown to foreign countries where the human-rights laws allowed for harsher means of interrogation, including torture.\n \n On taking office President Barack Obama moved to outlaw all forms of torture by the US military or its intelligence agencies. He also ordered the immediate closing down of the so-called \"black sites\" in foreign countries to which some terror suspects had been shipped for harsh interrogation, and authorised an investigation into claims that laws were broken by the CIA in pursuit of terror-related intelligence. \n \n Those convicted yesterday were ordered to pay \u00801m to the cleric, who remains in Egypt, and \u0080500,000 to his wife as restitution for suffering. Two former Italian intelligent agents were also found guilty in the case and were each given three-year prison terms.\n \n The rulings were welcomed by human-rights activists. The send \"a strong signal of the crimes committed by the CIA in Europe,\" said Joanne Mariner of Human Rights Watch. The government of Silvio Berlusconi in Rome refused to assist prosecutors in the case, however, notably by declining to seek the extradition of those accused for fear of damaging US-Italian relations. Because of Rome's reticence and the labyrinth of appeals possibilities that now open up, it seems unlikely the individuals will ever actually go to prison.\n \n The CIA was tight-lipped about the sentences, CIA spokesman George Little noting that the \"CIA has not commented on any of the allegations surrounding Abu Omar\".\n \n CIA agents sentenced in Italy rendition case - Europe, World - The Independent",

   "Italy got it right: CIA renditions are wrong\n The conviction of 23 Americans in the abduction of Muslim cleric Abu Omar may be largely symbolic, but it sends an important message to the Obama administration.\n November 6, 2009\n \n 'Extrajudicial detentions\" and \"extraordinary renditions\" were nicely scrubbed terms for the Bush administration's policy of capturing suspects in one country and spiriting them away to another, where they were harshly interrogated and even tortured. Now an Italian court has called this CIA practice by its real name -- illegal. \n \n The conviction of 23 Americans and two Italians for kidnapping an Egyptian cleric off the streets of Milan in 2003 in one sense is largely symbolic: The defendants were tried in absentia, and the Italian government is not seeking their extradition; barring a successful appeal, the two governments may try to work out a clemency deal. Yet the decision matters. It repudiates President Obama's expressed desire to look away from the ugly past, and sends a strong message that the U.S. government cannot operate outside the law with impunity in the name of fighting terrorism. \n \n The CIA abducted Hassan Osama Nasr on Feb. 17, 2003. The Muslim cleric, suspected of recruiting insurgents for Iraq and Afghanistan, was flown to Egypt, where he allegedly was tortured with electric shocks, beatings and threats of rape. He was released in 2007.\n \n Obama has since ended CIA interrogations in secret prisons and shut overseas jails used by the CIA, but he has not stopped the practice of extraordinary rendition. The difference between his and his predecessor's policy is that the administration will now demand credible assurances that prisoners won't be tortured, and that prisoners will be \"rendered to justice\" rather than held indefinitely without trial.\n \n We don't like renditions and generally think even the most dangerous criminals are entitled to due process, including extradition hearings. A war against violent extremists cannot be won by immoral or illegal means; the U.S. can't outsource dirty work and claim to have clean hands. \n \n Some have questioned how this case differs from the capture of Nazi Germany's Adolf Eichmann by Israeli security forces in Buenos Aires in May 1960, an extrajudicial action that was widely praised at the time. One significant difference is that Argentina's military government was harboring a war criminal, whereas Italy had opened its own criminal investigation of Nasr when the CIA swooped in to kidnap him. Another is that Eichmann was put on trial, publicly. Nasr, to say the least, was not.\n \n Italy got it right: CIA renditions are wrong -- latimes.com",

   "AT HIS inauguration, Barack Obama insisted that the choice between America's safety and its ideals was a false one. In a clear dig at his predecessor for abuses in the \"war on terror\", he wanted to signal a clean break with the past. Yet the fact that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the self-styled mastermind behind the 2001 attacks on New York and Washington, and four co-defendants are to stand trial in a federal court in New York brings this past back to haunt the administration. It is a big step towards settling the individual fates of the 215 detainees still left at the Guant\u00e1namo Bay detention centre. But Mr Obama admitted this week that he still cannot meet his own January deadline to close the camp. \n \n America's civilian courts have a good record of trying complex terrorism and conspiracy cases. But many critics doubt the country's safety and its ideals should be reconciled in this way. Eric Holder, the attorney-general, says five other Guant\u00e1namo inmates will be tried before reformed military tribunals. Why, ask some victims' families, backed by some of Mr Obama's political opponents, can't all trials take place in military courts ?\n \n More may end up before military judges soon, as prosecutors from the Departments of Justice and Defence assign cases considered fit for trial to either civilian or military courts. But like the five cases Mr Holder has sent to military tribunals so far, including the attack on the USS Cole in the port of Aden in 2000 which killed 17 American sailors, they will chiefly involve battlefield crimes or attacks on military targets. \n \n By contrast, the September 2001 attacks killed some 3,000 civilians. But many are worried about Mr Mohammed's trial. Putting it in New York may make the city a bigger terrorist target; some may question whether a jury of New Yorkers can provide a fair trial. Since he was among a small number of prisoners subjected to repeated waterboarding, a technique Mr Holder calls torture, the charges may not stick, though Justice Department officials think they have enough untainted evidence to secure conviction. And Mr Mohammed and his alleged helpers may use open court to proclaim violent jihad against America; he has said he would welcome the martyrdom of a death sentence. \n \n Some 40 Guant\u00e1namo inmates may face trial of some sort. About 90 have been cleared for release, though officials struggle to find countries willing to take them. But Mr Obama has yet to decide what to do with a hard core deemed unfit for either release or trial. The smart money is now on an under-used prison in rural Illinois to house them. Guant\u00e1namo by another name? \n \n After Guant\u00e1namo: Trials to come | The Economist\n \n \n That's all the news for today. I leave you with a thoughtful, wise, enlightened comment about the Dreyfus trial, which is as relevant today as it was then, specially now that Bush and the conservatives have shown us how easily civil liberties can be eroded and basic human rights breached in the name of protecting the nation. \n \n \n\"The lesson to be learned is the lesson Clemenceau had tried to teach the jury at Zola's trial.

   "Jane Mayer, in her review of Marc Thiessen's \"Courting Disaster\", offers a fine dissection of that book's flaws (Books, March 29th). \n Torture is wrong under any circumstances. As General David H. Petraeus recently remarked (specifically referring to Abu Grhaib and to Guant\u00e1namo), such abusive techniques are \"no biodegradable.... The enemy continues to beat you with them like a stick.\"He is right-the pictures from Abu Grhaib and the publicity surrounding Guant\u00e1namo, waterboarding, and other \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" have created far more terrorists than most people understand.\n \n For a country that professes to stand for the rule of the law and individual rights, we look like the worst kind of hypocrites. Consider a war we fought in the past against a brutal enemy that tortured and killed prisoners, executed civilians, and engaged in a number of atrocities. Several American leaders argued that the only way to prevail was to engage in the same kind of tactics, because that was the only thing that the enemy understood or respected (sounds familiar?). But other leaders believed that it was not good enough to win; they also had to do it in a way that was consistent with the values of their society and the principles of their cause. That conflict was the Revolutionary War, and the leaders included George Washington and John Adams.\n If we mean what we say-if we really that we are the good guys, and I hope we do-then this is the time to stand by those principles which our Founding Fathers professed and lived by. That is what, I hope, makes us the leaders of the free world.\n \n Brigadier General Patrick Finnegan\n Dean of the Academic Board\n The United States Military Academy at West Point\n West Point, N.Y.\n \n (The New Yorker, May 3, 2010, \"The Mail\", page 3)",
