   "\"One-vote majority rulings carry the same legal weight as all majority opinions. Yet they lack the symbolic power of decisions by a more united court. Experts consider these 5-to-4 decisions to be more expressly political than others, representing a threat to the court's moral authority....\n \n \"The Roberts Court has relied on 5-to-4 majorities to pass many of its headline decisions: from this weeks ruling that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual's right to gun ownership to the Lilly Ledbetter case, limiting an employee's ability to file a pay discrimination claim, to the Citizens United decision, which allowed unlimited corporate and union spending in elections....\n \n \"Studies show that 5-to-4 decisions are the most likely rulings to be overturned by later Supreme Courts. \n \n \"But the deeper issue transcends any one case or court. The 'supreme' authority of the high court rests on its legitimacy. The more absent consensus is from the high court, the more diminished its legitimacy and the more each decision will come to be viewed through a political lens.\"\n The Polarization of the Supreme Court - Yahoo! News\n \n Interesting reading. As the article points out, there is a polarization between very conservative justices and moderately liberal justices. So has it just become a competition to see which side can have more justices representing its political views on the court? David Souter, one of the more liberal justices, retired in 2009 and was replaced by Sotomayor. If one of the conservative justices instead of Souter had retired that year then I can think of a few recent rulings that likely would have turned out quite differently. Doubts naturally arise about the outcome of a case that seems so dependent on luck. Can it really be trusted to be the truth? And what happens if a conservative Supreme Court justice retires during the next six years and Obama selects a more liberal replacement?",

   "The Constitution says nothing about the number of justices the Supreme Court must have. That has always been a political decision. To my knowledge the Supreme Court has never had more than 9 members. And there have been times when the Congress has abolished seats on the Court rather than allow a disliked current president to appoint a successor- only to re-create that same seat when the president was more to Congress' liking.\n \n The U.S. Supreme Court has always been a political body, and always will be. Adding members to the Court will only fix the Court on the public's current position on the political spectrum. But in a decade's time the Court would be just as out of sync with the public as it has ever been. So the problem is not with the Court, but rather disunity of the American People.",

   "Our present-day problems stem from the corporate takeover of America, particularly, a takeover of the U.S. Supreme Court:\n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court shows a striking tendency to elevate corporate profits and private wealth over individual rights and personal freedoms. Forty percent of the cases on today's Supreme Court docket involve or are significant to big business, a 10% increase since 2005. The Court is siding with powerful corporate interests at record rates: in the 2009-10 term, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, had one of its most successful years before the Court, winning 81% of their cases. In closely divided cases, the five most conservative justices side with big business 85% of the time--and in close cases Justice Samuel Alito has been siding with powerful corporate interests100% of the time.\n \n The Corporate Court's decisions affect the everyday lives of millions of Americans, and the results have been disastrous. In the past several years, the Corporate Court has radically rewritten laws in order to shield big business from liability, insulate corporate interests from regulation, make it easier for companies to discriminate, and enable powerful interests to flood our elections with special interest dollars.\n \n Congress has the power to repair some of the damage caused by the Corporate Court. After the Supreme Court undermined settled antidiscrimination law in Ledbetter v. Goodyear, Congress passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 to restore Americans' rights to equal pay for equal work. Further legislation can fix some of the disastrous effects of recent decisions such as Exxon v. Baker, Riegel v. Medtronic, Gross v. FBL Financial Services, and Citizens United v. FEC, among others.... \n\n Alliance for Justice:\n AFJ.org | Alliance for Justice",

Anybody who could make such a stupid statement obviously has no knowledge, or no interest, of what's really going on around them. This country has at least 30,000 gun laws, on city, county, state and federal levels. We have laws regulating absolutely everything that could ever possibly be done with a firearm in any manner. \n \n There's no such thing as an under-regulation of firearms in America.

The Second Amendment is far from being unnecessary. If anything it's more necessary than ever before in history. If the courts could rule that the Second Amendment was outdated and no longer applied, they'd be setting the precedent for dismantling the rest of the Constitution in the process. You can't take one out and leave the rest standing, this isn't a game of jenga.\n \n \nWhen the 2nd Amendment was proposed and ratified gun ownership was a universal fact everywhere in America (except maybe for places like Sally Hemmings' house on Massa Jefferson's plantation).\n\n \n Gonna play the old \"The Second Amendment was about preserving the slave trade\" argument now?\n \n \nAnd these guns were universally used to put food on the table and Anglo-Americans had never theretofore shirked their duty to turn out armed and en masse to repel any invasion or suppress any rebellion against legitimate government authority.\n\n \n Come on don't be stupid. The government worked for we the people, and they did as told under threat of overwhelming violence against them if they acted up. That's how it's supposed to work, that's how it's going to work again. The Second Amendment was never about the government being able to force the people it served, to turn around and serve it and do as told like brainwashed slaves.\n \n \nSo the 2nd Amendment does not recognize any right that didn't already exist. But at the same time the 2nd Amendment does not create or recognize any right to engage in armed rebellion against the government since no government can recognize such a right and maintain its sovereignty.\n\n \n The Constitution isn't a tool of government to be used against the people. It's a weapon of the people to deploy against the government when it starts to get out of control and turn against the people. Do you have no understanding of history whatsoever? There doesn't need to be a right to an armed rebellion against the government spelled out in the Constitution.\n \n \nThe government must always have the legal authority to regulate private ownership of weapons\n\n \n You mean like outlawing anything it considers \"scary looking\" and \"not suitable for hunting\"?\n \n \nand it must always have the legal authority to use overwhelming armed force against any armed power that may attempt to overthrow or rebel against it.\n\n \n So basically you're arguing that the government should have absolute, dictatorship status and power, and the authority to not only enslave the people that formed it, but kill absolutely anyone who dares to disagree with their agendas?\n \n Your argument is basically an endorsement for the government to punish the people who vote for one political party or the other. Following your statement Obama and congress should have the power to crush those that vote for the republican party in November.\n \n \nSo what the 2nd Amendment did was grant Congress the power to regulate the ownership of firearms.\n\n \n Wrong again!

The law specified who had to own weapons (at the owner's expense), but it also specified the kinds of weapons that had to be owned as well as the number of each kind. The great bulk of the population were excluded from the law and thus could not legally own weapons -lest they go on a crime spree or rebel against the government), and the people that could own weapons had to provide military service, swear allegiance to the King and could only own the weapons that the law specifically said they could own- lest they go on a crime spree or rebel against the government. You did not have a right to have or be part of a private army or other military force not under the government's control and you did not have a right to engage in armed rebellion against duly constituted government.\n \n Some people tried to tell the U.S. Supreme Court in District of Columbia v. Heller that the Assize of Arms granted a right to bear arms, but the Court did not use it as precedence in issuing the decision. The Court did cite the English Bill of Rights of 1689 as precedence for a right to bear arms under U.S. law. However, the Court's ruling must have been some kind of convoluted since the English Bill of Rights did not specifically recognize the right of an individual person to own weapons- and Roman Catholics (as was the case with Jews under the Assize of Arms) were forbidden to be armed at all.",

   "Powered by Google Docs\n \n An early Virginia colonial law granted everyone a right to sell arms and ammunition to \"any of His Majesty's loyal subjects inhabiting this colony...\"- meaning nobody had a right to use armed force against the colony's legitimate government. A right to bear arms is not a right to rebel.\n \n A mid-17th century Virginia law restricted how guns could be used. There was to be no shooting when drinking (and presumably pot-smoking?) unless you were at a wedding or funeral (the same thing to a lib?) because firing a gun was the common alarm signal for an Indian attack.\n \n A 1680 Virginia law prohibited slaves and other black people from having weapons. And even when this law was changed in 1723 due to the large population of free blacks and Indians living in the colony the law still limited gun ownership to 1 gun per person and that person had to be a householder. Any black or Indian who was not a householder or otherwise on the muster rolls of the government's militia was required by law to turn get rid of their guns by the end of 1723. Any black or Indian living on the frontier could own a gun if they got a license from the government. And by 1738 the law was once again changed so that blacks and Indians could not own guns even if they were part of the militia.\n \n A 1735 South Carolina law authorized the search of slave quarters for guns and no slave or free black could then own a gun without getting a license from the government. \n \n So, the right to bear arms has never been as absolute as the libs claim.",

They had confidence that their system of government was fundamentally different from what they experienced under the British. Samuel Adams, one of the original Sons of Liberty who rebelled against the British in Boston, said: \n \n \"Rebellion against a king may be pardoned, or lightly punished, but the man who dares to rebel against the laws of a republic ought to suffer death.\"\n \n Here are some examples of government authority over firearms in early America:\n \n -In Anglo-American law, the state may exercise extraordinary powers and even abridge basic civil liberties like the right to a trial, at moments of military emergency. The practice of impressment [confiscation of private property for public use] is, like the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus, an application of the state's military power.... Of ten states that practiced the impressment of arms during the Revolution, eight appear to have permanently discontinued the practice by 1787.\n \n -Almost thirty years ago, Edmund Morgan observed that white Virginians excluded African-Americans, Indians, and indentured servants from the body politic and denied them the most fundamental of rights. In 1998, Michael Bellesiles applied this observation to the issue of gun ownership, demonstrating that most colonial jurisdictions denied these groups the right to keep weapons.\n \n - When called upon by the Continental Congress to disarm non-associators, legislatures enacted a series of measures that ordered the disarmament of those refusing to take up arms against the king.\n \n -Pennsylvania's Test Act of 1777 marks the return to voluntary allegiance as the standard of membership in the body politic. It required all white men over eighteen to swear an oath declaring allegiance to the commonwealth, abjuring all allegiance to the British monarchy, and promising to do nothing injurious to the freedom and independence of the state. The act prohibited those refusing the test from voting, holding office, serving on juries, suing, and transferring land. It also ordered them disarmed.\n \n - Maryland instituted a test oath in 1777 and barred those refusing from the basic civil liberties of voting, holding office, serving on juries, suing, and keeping arms.\n \n - North Carolina followed suit, barring non-testors from basic liberties including the keeping of arms while promising that any who relented would be \"held and deemed a good subject of this state, and shall enjoy the privileges thereof.\"\n \n - Early American militia laws prohibited any use of guns on the day of muster unless expressly ordered by militia officers. They also required militiamen and other householders to bring their guns to the muster field twice a year so that militia officers could record which men in the community owned guns. Some colonies authorized door-to-door surveys of gun ownership.\n \n - Colonial governments expressed particular concern over the firing of guns after dark, in part because the traditional method of raising the alarm of an attack after dark involved the firing of several guns in succession. Thus, an amendment to New Hampshire's militia law prohibited the firing of guns after sunset during \"time of war or watch.\" Connecticut and Georgia enacted similar measures.\n \n - By 1770, the shooting of guns was prohibited in the cities of Philadelphia, New York, and Boston. The colonies of Pennsylvania and New York extended this prohibition to all other towns and boroughs. Delaware also prohibited the firing of guns within built-up areas, but made an exception for \"days of public rejoicing.\"\n \n - Rhode Island banned the placement of shooting ranges lying across a public highway. Pennsylvania banned gunfire \"on or near any of the King's highways.\" The legislature noted, however, that the fine did not extend \"to any person carrying a gun on the public highway.\" New Jersey also explicitly protected the carrying of guns on the highways.\n \n - Massachusetts regulated the manner of keeping arms as well as the manner of using them. As a precaution against the accidental wounding of firefighters, the state prohibited the storage of loaded guns in any house within the town of Boston. At least some of these laws, including the prohibition of storing loaded guns in Boston, provided for the confiscation of the gun as penalty. North Carolina and New Jersey both acted to prevent trespasses by hunters and to preserve their game populations by levying steep fines for abusive hunting practices. Each colony also provided that hunters without a \"settled habitation\" or residence in the colony would forfeit their guns.\n Robert H.

   "You seem to miss something very important. The Founding Fathers had to deal personally with a corrupt tyrant of a king who ran a kangaroo court in whatever manner he decided fit, so long as he was exempt from any and all laws. This tyrant sent his armed forces to disarm the people of Lexington And Concord and confiscate all found weapons.\n\n \n Don't lecture me about my country's history. Nothing you say here is news to me.\n \n And what you don't realize is that Britain had a sovereign government and each of the colonies had a sovereign government that acting in unison created a sovereign government of the United States which created an army and used it to wage war. The Revolutionary War was not about individual persons rebelling against a sovereign government but rather one sovereign government fighting against another. Not one single American militiaman or soldier acted on his own authority to use firearms against anybody except in personal self-defense. Otherwise they acted only under the authority of their duly constituted sovereign government.\n \n \nHaving lived through all of this, why would the Founding Fathers -people who escaped oppression and fought so hard for freedom- set up a system that would make it impossible for the people to defeat a local tyrant that emerged from the government?\n \n They didn't. They created a Constitution that guarantees trial by jury; guarantees freedom of speech; guarantees freedom of the press; guarantees a right to assemble in a peaceful manner and guarantees a right to petition the government in a peaceful manner. You have no need to use armed force against the government as long as these constitutional freedoms are operational, and if you don't know how to use these freedoms and feel compelled to play the rebel and take up arms, it isn't anybody's fault but your own.\n \n It is true that the separate states have the constitutional authority to have a militia- but only under training regulations established by the Congress and only to the extent that each state's militia can be legally mustered into federal service, i.e., no state militia has a legal right to oppose the government of the United States. All of this is in the U.S. Constitution. \n \n Get used to it.",

   "Samuel Adams, one of the original Sons of Liberty who rebelled against the British in Boston, said: \n \n \"Rebellion against a king may be pardoned, or lightly punished, but the man who dares to rebel against the laws of a republic ought to suffer death.\"\n\n \n Supposed quotes from Founding Fathers that the cabin-in-the-woods types spout in support of a right to armed rebellion are a dime a dozen. Looking on the net, you can easily get the impression that not one single Founding Father had any respect for the rule of law. I am glad to see someone finally post something to counter the libertarians' ignorance and stupidity.\n \n \nHere are some examples of government authority over firearms in early America:\n \n -In Anglo-American law, the state may exercise extraordinary powers and even abridge basic civil liberties like the right to a trial, at moments of military emergency. The practice of impressment [confiscation of private property for public use] is, like the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus, an application of the state's military power.... Of ten states that practiced the impressment of arms during the Revolution, eight appear to have permanently discontinued the practice by 1787.\n\n \n The Continental/Confederation Congress passed laws that gave General George Washington the legal authority to simply take whatever supplies he needed for his army and compel the owners to accept (worthless) U.S. paper money as payment. Washington refused on the grounds that such tactics would erode public support for his army and the American cause in general. The result was Valley Forge.\n \n But by the time the War ended and Washington resigned his command his officers conspired to overthrow him so they could march on Congress to demand their long overdue back pay. Washington got wind of the scheme and crashed a secret meeting of his officers and under the guise of reading a letter he put on his eyeglasses. Most (if not all) of his officers had never before seen him wearing his glasses. And when Washington remarked that he had not only grown old in service of his country he had also become blind, his officers broke down in tears and their insurrection dissolved.\n \n \n-Almost thirty years ago, Edmund Morgan observed that white Virginians excluded African-Americans, Indians, and indentured servants from the body politic and denied them the most fundamental of rights. In 1998, Michael Bellesiles applied this observation to the issue of gun ownership, demonstrating that most colonial jurisdictions denied these groups the right to keep weapons.\n\n \n Bellesiles was one of my history professors at Emory. I only had him for one course- the first semester of freshman-level American history (A course grade; 98% on the final). I took AP American History in the 11th grade, but was afraid to take the AP exam because the teacher had a prolonged family crisis 3 states away and was absent so often that we fell too far behind to have any practice with essay questions. I did score a 4/5 on the AP exam for European history and received credit for both freshman European history courses at Emory.\n \n Bellesiles wasn't any more liberal than any other professor at Emory was, and the course didn't really get into politics. I never got the impression (as I did with some other professors) that he allowed his personal politics to influence the grades he gave. However, I have seen several (pro-gun) websites that question the facts he presented concerning gun ownership in America during the Colonial/Revolutionary period.\n \n \n\n Robert H.

Nothing in the Constitution grants authority to the government to form a private army made of any state militia, to be used as a hammer to smite another militia that rises up due to concerns of local tyranny.\n \n Your argument is foolish. For what you say to be true it would have to mean that even back then, the government had the authority to disregard the people that assembled it, and elevate itself to the position of King of America and rule with an iron fist, and order an army of the people to kill absolutely anyone and everyone that would dare oppose or resist.\n \n Despite what some might claim to the contrary, there's simply no such thing as an authority for the government to preserve itself above all else.
