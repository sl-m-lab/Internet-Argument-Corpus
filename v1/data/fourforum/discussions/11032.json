   "Terrible, terrible disease in which no one is OK.\n I think there is 3% 5 year survival rate. \n \n Only 10-20% are candidates for treatment, which is surgery, which is terrible - removal of the pancreas, which you kinda need, and everything else nearby.",

   "Yes, as Moose said, not good at all. The procedure is called a Whipple Procedure. A Whipple typically involves removing the panceas, gallbladder and common bile duct, part of the stomach, a significant portion of the small intestine, and local lymph nodes. \n \n It appears as a rather ominous sign that there has been no mention of Swayze being a candidate for the surgery. Reports indicate that he has completed 3 rounds of chemotherapy, but no mention of surgery has been made so far as I have seen. Certainly not a good sign. \n \n On an off note, I was never a huge fan of his work. I only really liked 2 of his films. Roadhouse, which if not for Sam Elliot and Swayze would have been a complete failure (the other actors in that movie make me want to swallow razor blades). The other film I thought he was phenominal in was Point Break. If they just would have cast someone other than that Keanunoo Reeves guy, it would have been just completely awesome. (Sorry folks, but Keanu Reeves has the acting ability of a pineapple.)\n \n On a related sad note, did anyone else hear that Jeff Healey died just 9 days ago? He was the musician that starred in Roadhouse with Swayze. For those who are not familiar with Healey, he was an incredible jazz/blues guitarist who played his guitar flat on his lap. He was also blind. He has been compared in talent to the likes of Stevie Ray Vaughan. For those who are familiar, wow...how sad.",

Without the three of them, there would have been nothing worth paying to see. Ben Gazzara certainly doesn't get an oscar nomination.",
