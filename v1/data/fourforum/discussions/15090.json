   "Attention: This House Is Gun-Free - Investors.com\n \n \nThe anti-gun lobby has sought to impose what it calls \"sensible restrictions\" on gun ownership ever since Otis McDonald, a 76-year-old Army veteran who lives in a high crime area of Chicago, won his case before the U.S. Supreme Court saying the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution he fought to protect gives him the right to bear arms.\n \n These restrictions vary from training and education requirements to waiting periods to limiting the number of purchases. Some are indeed sensible, but most are simply designed to discourage prospective gun owners with too many hoops to jump through.\n \n Gun-rights opponents in Illinois apparently have hit on a new tactic - shame and embarrass gun owners by publicly naming them in much the same manner some communities print the names of johns who patronize hookers in the local paper.\n \n In the liberal mind, patronizing a lady of the evening and protecting your family with a firearm are illicit activities that should be discouraged.\n \n Last fall, a reporter for the Associated Press made a Freedom of Information Act request to Illinois police for the names of the 1.3 million residents who hold state firearms owners identification cards as well as information about the types of weapons they're authorized to possess.\n \n The permit holders' addresses and phone numbers would not be released. But it wouldn't be that difficult for some anti-gun group to research and add them to the lists of names and weapons. If the state publishes a list of gun owners, Republican state Rep. Ron Stephens said, \"You are by design also publishing a list of everyone who doesn't\" carry a firearm.\n \n Stephens is pushing a bill in the Illinois General Assembly to lock down the list. State Attorney General Lisa Madigan says she sees no invasion of privacy or endangerment of individuals in releasing the list of names that she has ruled to be a public document.\n \n Richard Pearson, director of the Illinois State Rifle Association, disagrees. \"The safety of real people is at stake here,\" he says. \"Once this information is released, it will be distributed to street gangs and gun-control groups who will use the data to target gun owners for crime and harassment.\"\n \n Madigan cites no real public benefit from releasing the list of gun owners. Mark Walsh, campaign director for the Illinois Campaign To Prevent Gun Violence, claims making these records public would be \"helpful in making sure that local law enforcement and the state police are following up with these people who have FOID (Firearm Owner's Identification Program) cards who should be prohibited purchasers.\"\n \n Law enforcement should be doing it anyway. If they need more resources, give it to them, arguably a better use of tax dollars than funding bloated public sector employee union pension funds. Electronic sharing of such records between law enforcement agencies should suffice.\n \n We certainly don't want to see those with a history of violence, drug abuse or mental illness misusing firearms. Neither do we want to see the Otis McDonalds of Illinois or the rest of the country endangered or harassed by the public knowing who is armed.\n \n McDonald was a community activist who's been threatened for his efforts to rid his neighborhood of drug dealers and other criminals. \"This lawsuit, I hope, will allow me to bring my handgun into the city legally,\" he said. \"I only want a handgun in my house for my protection.\"\n \n There are Otis McDonalds out there who feel the same way but don't want to be identified. We argue that we're made safer if criminals and gangs don't know which homeowner might be armed.\n \n If they feel knowing makes us safer, let them put signs in their windows that they are gun-free and see what happens.\n \n Meanwhile, leave the rest of us alone to clean our guns.\n\n \n If that doesn't amount to an invasion of privacy then I don't know what is.",
