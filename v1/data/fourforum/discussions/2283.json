   "It becomes very difficult for Americans to understand that Muslims don't want us (the US), or those who support our Westernized Christianity (Jordan) in their part of the world because our culture has advanced(?) to a point where moral issues we consider permissive are not accepted by Muslim Law. They consider Israel pure land grabbing facilitated by the UN and perpetuated by the US. The incident in Thailand is based on a Muslim minority with a completely different language than that spoken in Thailand general attempting to be recognized in schools and government. Philippine Muslims are after the same recognition in a Catholic majority. Violence gets the attention of interested parties much quicker than negotiation, especially if those who seek recognition are a minority or oppressed (or occupied) population. \n \n We seem to ignore that our schools weren't integrated until almost 100-years after our civil war, that killed more Americans than any other war we've been in, and that racism is prominent in many parts of the US due to cultural differences (heritage). But we continue to press our religion and political ideology on all others and condemn those who refuse to accept them, rationalizing our use of violence by our cultural beliefs, without general recognition to our system of government being driven more by special interests than popular vote. \n \n No real changes over the centuries; different powers, different interested parties, different resource values, continued weaponry advancement and the same old belief systems. The only big difference is technology bringing communication to a level where everyone can see and discuss what has always been going on in one form or another for a long, long time.

   "To all seeming the fact that more and more Britons are converting into Islam, make British officials visibly tense and aggressive. Alas their effort to curb spreading of Islam in here. People living in Britain wish to know more about Islam and this can't be stopped!\n Now authorities decided that our schools are \"unique centers of terrorism\"! It is nonsense! They simply will never able to prove it 'cause that's not true. That is why UK Special Services have engineered a special operation, directed to discredit Islam with the aim of closing some Muslim Schools here!\n Well, the beating of pupils was provoked by them at some of our schools! Due to official version our children have deliberately beaten up and humiliated their coevals in local Muslim schools, although in reality It's absolutely different. British powers constantly make Muslims subject to racial hatred and covert or open oppression!\n Stop it! We have never done it! If you dream of closing our schools here - simply say it and do it!

It is very true that the vast majority of moslems throughout the world are peace loving people who want nothing more than to live in peace and security just as we do. They want to work in safe conditions and assure their children get good educations just like us. \n \n The sad reality for many of them who live in islamic countries though is that they live in fear and apprehension of their own friends and neighbors because they don't know who among them has ties with radicals, since it is for the most part a very closed society which is founded upon secrecy and mistrust. \n \n So when the local, district or regional Mullah calls for mass protests because of some cartoons as happened in Holland, or the uprisings in France and Australia around the same time by their local islamic communities; the locals answer the call and make a showing as ordered. But those people aren't really violent beyond the gang mentality which takes over when such large groups gather for a common cause. Those situations were all orchestrated, led and promoted by the powers who instigated those and other events like them around the world.\n \n My point for saying all of this is to show that the unwashed masses who make up the vast majority of the islamic world aren't committed or dedicated threats to anyone at all. They are powerless puppets of religious tyrants who use them for political gain as they see fit. Every moslem knows that the radical elements of their religion will think nothing of placing a suicide bomb or an IED where they happen to be if it serves the radicals political purpose and will kill infidels in the process. \n \n But given the opportunity to live as we do without Government or religious persecution and manipulation, a full 98% of all moslems on Earth would gladly be our neighbors, and they would be good ones whom we would be happy to live next to. The number of radicals intent on doing harm to anyone who rejects their world view is probably as small as 2% of all moslems on Earth in my opinion. Of course this percentage can't be confirmed, but we know they are a tiny minority of the whole population. \n \n Here's the rub though, and why that small number isn't so comforting for the worlds Governments who must protect against their random violence. It's because there are approximately 1.5 BILLION followers of islam on Earth today, and that figure is growing daily. And 2% of 1.5 BILLION is 30 MILLION. \n \n Some simple math tells us that with a current figure of 195 independent Countries on Earth today, that means that if these 30 million radical moslems were evenly distributed (which we know they are NOT) that would represent a solid 153,846. active and committed terrorists in every country on Earth. And that's enough terrorists to create mass chaos world wide. Even if we cut that number in half to 1%, we still have serious problems with the tiny minority of committed radicals out there who are just waiting for their respective marching orders. \n \n Although this link doesn't give a percentage for radicals, International Institute for Strategic Studies London Most Important City For Radical Islam it say's this:\n But as a small percentage of Muslim youth around the world have become, over the last 15 years, more susceptible to appeals from radicals, so too have British youth.\n I've seen some estimates as high as 5 to 10% of islam being radicalized, but I personally think those figures are over the top. This defines why even though they are a small minority, they pose a sizable threat to world peace and stability, IMHO.\n \n WikiAnswers - How many people follow Islam today\n \n The Number of Countries in the World - Number of Countries Worldwide",

And 2% of 1.5 BILLION is 30 MILLION. \n \n Some simple math tells us that with a current figure of 195 independent Countries on Earth today, that means that if these 30 million radical moslems were evenly distributed (which we know they are NOT) that would represent a solid 153,846. active and committed terrorists in every country on Earth. And that's enough terrorists to create mass chaos world wide. Even if we cut that number in half to 1%, we still have serious problems with the tiny minority of committed radicals out there who are just waiting for their respective marching orders. \n \n Although this link doesn't give a percentage for radicals, International Institute for Strategic Studies London Most Important City For Radical Islam it say's this:\n But as a small percentage of Muslim youth around the world have become, over the last 15 years, more susceptible to appeals from radicals, so too have British youth.\n I've seen some estimates as high as 5 to 10% of islam being radicalized, but I personally think those figures are over the top. This defines why even though they are a small minority, they pose a sizable threat to world peace and stability, IMHO.\n \n WikiAnswers - How many people follow Islam today\n \n The Number of Countries in the World - Number of Countries Worldwide\n",

   "As the anti-Semitic bigots blame Israel for defending themselves and completely ignore the culpability of hamas for placing civilians in harms way solely for their propaganda value, here is more on the ruthless treatment of this terror group to use and abuse the citizens it would have the most ignorant among us believe it is fighting to protect. Can anyone explain why they would refuse to release the wounded to the safety and care of Egypt who waited at the Gaza border with empty ambulances to no avail? \n Egypt says Hamas not allowing wounded to leave Gaza\n \n Egypt has blamed Hamas for not letting hundreds of Palestinians wounded by Israeli air strikes to leave the Gaza Strip for treatment, with dozens of empty ambulances waiting on the border.\n \n Hamas said it was drawing up lists of the wounded but it was proving difficult to transport them to the border because of the seriousness of their injuries and ongoing Israeli strikes on the impoverished territory.\n \n More than 280 Palestinians have been killed and 600 wounded since Israel began hammering the Gaza Strip with air strikes on Saturday, but no wounded have yet left via Rafah, the Hamas-ruled territory's only Arab border crossing.\n \n \"No one has come in, we don't know why they're closed on the other side,\" said a senior border security official. Several plane- and truck-loads of aid are also waiting to be allowed into the Gaza Strip, a security official said.\n \n \"The wounded are barred from crossing\" into Egypt, Foreign Minister Ahmed Abul Gheit said in Cairo, blaming \"those who control Gaza. We are waiting for the wounded to cross.\"\n \n In the divided town of Rafah, the road leading to the border crossing was lined with 20 riot police vehicles, with 40 ambulances and several pick-ups full of medicine waiting to cross into Gaza.Egypt says Hamas not allowing wounded to leave Gaza - Worldnews.com\n \n And here we see your hero's dressing as doctors, using a hospital as a base of operations along with patients; women and children as human shields in the hospital.\n January 5, 2009\n \n Hamas Leadership Hides in Hospital\n \n Topics: Middle East News and Perspectives, Terrorism\n Confronted by an Israeli ground assault, Hamas leadership is using medical professionals and their patients as human shields:\n \n The defense officials said it was likely that a number of senior Hamas operatives and terror chiefs were hiding and conducting their operations from within Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. \"Hamas operatives are in the hospital and have disguised themselves as nurses and doctors,\" one official said. OC Military Intelligence Maj.-Gen. Amos Yadlin told the cabinet that Hamas was using mosques, public institutions and private homes as ammunition stores.\n Here's why Israel hit several mosques:\n \n See video here:\n \n You get the picture. Hamas, as a terrorist organization, uses civilians to shield its instruments of terror. \n Hamas Leadership Hides in Hospital :: Middle East News and Perspectives :: Hyscience\n \n Here's a Palestinian girl who is obviously a traitor since she blames hamas for causing the war. Why is it that despite all of the brainwashing she has received to hate Jews, it is her own people she fears the most? How proud you must be of the hero's you defend so staunchly as you condemn Israel for simply defending themselves.\n Palestinian girl: 'Hamas is the cause in the first place of all wars' :: Middle East News and Perspectives :: Hyscience",
