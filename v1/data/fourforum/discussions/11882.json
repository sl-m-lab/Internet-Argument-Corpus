   "Argentina's economy crashed terribly as a result of free market reforms imposed by the IMF, and South Korea (and most of the other successful ones on your list) actually engaged in a protectionist command economy for a long time before opening up to trade. Free trade, like any form of anarchy, allows the strong to harm the weak. In any case, it doesn't make sense in a global market to look at individual countries, only the global effect, which has been largely negative. It was free trade that caused the famine in Ethiopia in the 80s, there was enough food but people couldn't afford to buy it so it was exported instead.",

   "Free traders, rummers, smugglers, disdainers of law, pirates, essentially.\n \n But wait! Weren't the pirates a Marxist lot? Aren't there rumors about Black Beard and his communistic leanings?\n \nIt is difficult to separate the myth from the reality with smugglers. Were they free traders, organised crime, villans, local heroes?\n \n Cornwall was suitable for smuggling in that it had a long expanse of rocky, virtually uninhabited coast, with few revenue men to patrol it. The goods smuggled included tea, brandy, gin, rum and tobacco. Following numerous increases in tea tax, tea could be bought in Europe for 1/6th of the price in Britain, while French brandy was only 1/5th of the price.\n \n Initially, smuggling took place fairly openly with cargoes landed directly on the shore. This was made possible by the involvement of all sections of the community, from the local landowner downwards. The involvement of the gentry would range from turning a blind eye, to full scale involvement. The Killigrew family who established Falmouth, was one family whose money and influence came from smuggling and piracy.\n \n Smuggling boomed until the end of the 18th century. Some souces say 500,000 gallons of French brandy per year were sumggled into Cornwall. In addition ships returning from the far east would heave to off shore and sell china, silk and cotton goods free of tax to local boats. In 1763, three East Indiamen in Falmouth harbour, are said to have sold \u00a320,000 of goods in this way.\n \n However from around 1800 the Revenue men became more organised and proactive. Smuggled goods had to be dropped off in remote coves, and picked up again when the coast was clear. Tunnels and passages were dug out of the rocks to expedite movement.\n \n The risks involved in smuggling were high. A minimum penalty of transportation to colonies such as Australia, was common, and often the penalties were much more severe. Robert Lang, a smuggler from Veryan, is recorded as being hung at the crossroads of Ruanlanihorne and St. Mawes as an example to others.\n \n Once landed, much of the contraband made its way up country. On the windswept wastes of Bodmin Moor Jamaica Inn is perhaps the best known of all smuggling haunts, thanks to Daphne Du Maurier's novel. It is surrounded by barren country and often hemmed in by chill winds and thick mists, and the approach is perhaps more spectacular than the building itself. \n\n Smugglers And Smuggling in Cornwall",

   "You have this penchant for requiring that anyone who refers to anyone or any system as marxist to prove they abide by every single position marxist held to or promoted.\n\n \n Strawman. I demand that someone who calls someone a Marxist/Communist actually understand what those terms mean. Calling someone a Marxist because they support wealth redistribution is stupid as it makes Reagan who supported the EITC a Marxist. Isly's of course a fool for arguing that but that's not news. You would not call someone a Capitalist if they supported Communist economic models. Likewise, you would not call someone a Communist if they rejected the very core of Marxism and Communism.\n \n You people are bent out of shape because you have finally run into someone who actually understands Marxism and Communism and calls you on your bull**** claims. \n \n \nWhen the reality is that no person or system has ever adopted true marxism as he intended it to be practiced.\n\n \n No one has even come close. The USSR violated some key aspects of Marxism. It's hard to call yourself a Marxist society when you have classes, are a dictatorship of the few and practice some level of capitalism and be taken seriously by those who understand Marxism. \n \n \nWhat is undeniable though and what isly has very effectively proven, as I have also on other threads, is that Obama embraces many Marxist policies, NOT ALL OF THEM, but many of them.\n\n \n Isly has done no such thing. You are just as ignorant to Marxism as she is. \n \n I asked her to prove how Obama lined up with key core beliefs. She fled. I asked you the same thing. You never even tried. At ABSOLUTE very most, Obama is a weak cultural Marxist. Economically, he's far from it. Isly's argument is purely based around wealth redistribution. The problem is that such criteria makes Reagan, Nixon and Thatcher all Marxists. You'll notice she won't address that huge flaw in her arguments. \n \n \nHe also identifies with known marxists/socialists, and regarding his own cousin in Kenya whom he has campaigned for as he runs for President there, Obama identifies with pro-islamic communists also.\n\n \n lol. You are trying to cast standing with his relative during one event as full support and ideological acceptance of those beliefs. Really.\n \n \nSo please don't nit pick regarding the precise depth or version of Obama's marxism when you know as well as we do what he represents in reality, and it sure aint capitalism. emoticon_xdonno\n\n \n Says the one who can't tell the difference between a market economy and a command economy.",
