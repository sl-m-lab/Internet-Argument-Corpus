   "Anti-war protestors, and whining liberals in general, have criticized the administration for not producing immediate evidence that Iraq actually had a Chemical, Biological, or Nuclear Weapons program. To me, this missing evidence is disturbing. It may mean that it has been removed from Iraq, and passed on to other enemy nations like Syria, Lebanon, or Iran. Just today, a paper jointly published by the Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency offers strong evidence of Iraq's mobile production facilities that were probably used to manufacture biological agents. These findings are consistent with the intelligence reports used in Secretary of State Powell's U.N. address. If other intelligence was correct, and the weapons we knew Iraq to possess in 1998 via UNSCOM existed, where did they go? If Saddam had ordered their destruction, wouldn't he have offered proof of such destruction, to twart the mounting threat of war? It seems to me as if these weapons have disappeared. Perhaps the fear that drove us to war in Iraq has been realized, and Iraq has passed them onto other enemy nations, or to terrorist networks around the world.\n \n In fact, many will remember that shortly after the Iraq war was heralded as a success that the Bush administration started warning Syria about harboring Iraqi officials and weapons. I have heard that intelligence reports are circulating that point to the strong possibility that the weapons we are looking for have been buried in the Bakaa Valley in Lebanon. Supposedly, they are six 50 to 60 meters under the ground. There are indications that Iraqi leaders and weapon scientists were being sheltered in a clandestine operation by Syria to help discredit the U.S. military effort in the region. Not surprisingly, Russia and the French have also been implicated as co-conspirators. \n \n There are serious problems in the region. I think our decision to send more troops into Iraq is also part of a decision to gear up for future action in Syria, and Lebanon. We will allow Iran to ride until we get those problem areas under control, since they are invariably linked to the violence inside Israel. If Bush's roadmap to peace is to succeed, we must choke Syria, and Hezbollah. Otherwise, a Palestinian state will only be used to stage future attacks on the Jewish people who are collectively hated by the Islamic world, at large.\n \n sources: \n [url=http://freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/892505/post]Busy Baghdad Highway to Damascus - US Close to Military Action against Iraqi and other Targets in Syria[url]\n Washington Post Story about the French Issuing Passports to members of Saddam's regime",

   "Whiny Liberals?????? What about all the bigotry you conservatives speak against us.\n \n As I said before in another post. Those nukes would take at least 3 years to build(whatched CNN). The UN wanted to wait till June to decide whether or not we needed a war. Bush wanted to got NOW, because he said Saddam could attack us far before June. But guess what? He couldn't of attacked us until 3 stinking years!\n :p\n \n Anti-War protesters made some good points, some were stupid but some weren't. Look at all the money we spent that could of been used to feed the homeless, fund schools etc... BTW, Africa would be a far better use of our military. You should support our military by only using them when absolutely needed.",
