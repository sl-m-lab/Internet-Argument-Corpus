   "How about Mark Brunnell? 22 completions in a row? Pretty good, but also gotta love the Broncos, 11 quarters without allowing a TD (although they allowed 6 FG's first game). Both of these teams looked really good Sunday (sorry, those 2 games are the only ones I watched :)) and they go into bye weeks. Hopefully Plummer can keep on remembering how to make decent decisions and they can get a roll going. Tough divisional opponent will be the Chargers, they've looked really good (bye this week).",

Hopefully Plummer can keep on remembering how to make decent decisions and they can get a roll going. Tough divisional opponent will be the Chargers, they've looked really good (bye this week).\n\n I know, I was soooooo hoping they'd go 3 full games without allowing a touchdown, but I'm still extremely proud of them. No one has gone that long since 1942!! I think they're going to do well. They got a bye, then they have two home games in a row, one against the Raiders. Things are looking up. I'm loving Jevon Walker too. Plus, they've beat New England 5 out of the last 6. How cool is that?!\n \nHopefully Plummer can keep on remembering how to make decent decisions and they can get a roll going.\n\n Amen to that brother!!\n And you're right, the Chargers will be their biggest challenge.\n \n I've always liked Mark Brunell too, so it's really nice to see him be so successful.",
