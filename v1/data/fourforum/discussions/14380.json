   "\"If carrying guns became legal, then police could no longer arrest people for carrying guns illegally!\" emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nNew York's tough gun-control laws were central to its success in reducing crime.\n\n \n Really?\n \n \n\n Crime in New York City - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n Although statistics report a falling crime rate, there is evidence that the data may have been manipulated to create the sense of a more secure atmosphere.[1]\n \n Violent crime in New York City has decreased in the last fifteen years and the murder rate in 2007 was at its lowest level since at least 1963, when reliable statistics were first kept and the city had half a million fewer residents.[2][3] Crime rates spiked in the 1980s and early 1990s as the crack epidemic hit the city. During the 1990s the New York City Police Department (NYPD) adopted CompStat, broken windows policing and other strategies in a major effort to reduce crime. The city's dramatic drop in crime has been attributed by criminologists to these policing tactics, the end of the crack epidemic and demographic changes.[4][5]\n \n\n \n I suppose you'd be happier if only the \"bad guys\" were armed, because that would make them easier to identify.",

State\n \nNo, says the Indiana Court of Appeals in Washington v. State. Correct, I think: The Supreme Court has repeatedly said that the standard for a Terry frisk is whether the officer reasonably suspects the person is \"armed and dangerous.\" \"Armed\" alone shouldn't be enough, although of course in many cases the two will go together. H/T Orin Kerr\n \n\n \n Can you, Galileo, figure out exactly why your police state tactics are unreasonable and unjustified? as well as being an abuse of police power?",

   "\"New York's tough gun-control laws were central to its success in reducing crime.\n\n \n Uh, no they weren't. The police being required to crack down and enforce all of the laws is what supposedly brought the crime rates down.\n \n \nBecause it is illegal to own a handgun without a difficult-to-get permit in New York,\n\n \n So according to you, you'd prefer it if only the bad guys are armed, because that makes it easy to tell who's the bad guy and who's the good guy; being the good guy is never armed, and thus never able to defend themselves.\n \n \nwhenever police see a suspicious bulge or other indication of a firearm, they can stop and frisk. Weapons searches are by far the most common stop-and-frisk activity in New York....\n\n \n Then prove it. Show us exactly where it's spelled out that New York police can frisk you over the mere sight of a bulge under your clothing. You claimed that's how it is, show us the proof that your claim is correct.\n \n \n\"A recent National Research Council report found that throughout the nation, aggressive stop-and-frisk tactics targeting illegal guns drive down crime....\n\n \n Prove that too. Prove that random and unconstitutional pat downs, without evidence to support them, have been the determining factor in driving down crime rates.\n \n \n\"If the Supreme Court were to recognize a right to bear arms, however, the police could no longer stop and frisk people who would merely be exercising a constitutional right.\n\n \n You know what? I don't care if it ties the hands the police behinds their backs, puts a ball gag in their mouth and a bag over their heads, and dumps them by the side of the road like garbage! We don't live in a police state. The powers of the police must come second to the rights of the people. Otherwise you're basically saying that the police should have the power to carry out warrantless searches of your home and private property, without reasonable suspicion and without justification. Under your standard the police should be allowed to break down your door in the middle of the night, destroy your home in their quest for evidence of some wrongdoing, and if they find nothing then you have no legal recourse over the destruction of private property.\n \n The police work for we the people. Our taxes pay their salaries. They shouldn't be allowed to exercise total control over us. Such standards creates a nation of fear and distrust that breeds resentment for authority, and is the leading cause of the creation of cop killers.\n \n \nWeapons searches would become illegal, and the ability of the police to chase gang and drug activity off the streets would be crippled.....\n\n \n Nothing more than pure and unadulterated BS! If you arrest somebody then there's nothing stopping you from searching them for weapons or other evidence of a crime. For what you claim to be true, it would mean that even if the police arrested a notorious drug kingpin and found a dozen guns in his coat, the police couldn't do anything about it despite his numerous felony convictions and possible murder warrants.\n \n You're as bad as Bloomberg.\n \n \n\"In high-crime drug- and gang-ridden communities, criminals are all too likely to exploit a right to bear arms to terrorize the community and engage in violent competition for the spoils of the drug trade....\"\n\n \n Kindly explain your position. Those responsible for the drug and gang crimes in these communities are likely to have felony convictions, meaning they're barred from owning a gun under any circumstances. These people have no right to keep and bear arms, as spelled out by the Gun Control Act of 1968.\n \n Illegal possession by a gang banger isn't the same as a law-abiding citizen owning a gun in a legal manner.",
