   "I must say, USA is a well-known \"fighter\" for peace and justice. And there is no secret for anybody that US next goal is Iran. Simply up to now everybody whispered about US plans of reforming power in Iran. And at last New Yorker has stated it openly. And it doesn't matter in what way USA plans to \"pursue democratic reforms\" in this country - with the help of Pakistan's Special Task forces, or launching missile strikes and preparing air attacks from Turkish and Georgian military bases, or using ethnic Azeri people, who dreams about reunification of northern areas with their historic Motherland, as detonator of revolutionary changes in Iran. Most likely America will try to involve all mentioned forces in order to achieve success there, because it's clear for anyone that Iran plays key role in the whole region of the Middle East.

Turkey won't let us stage from their country (not even for a billion dollars in friendship money). The president of Pakistan is already dodging daily assassination attempts, and now we have found that his troops on the afghan border who were \"hunting bin laden\" were in reality passing intel to Al Queda operatives. \n \n As far as using Georgian military bases, I suppose it would be a possibility, though I doubt it is an option from a purely logistical viewpoint. \n \n I can certainly see us trying to use internal factions to bring down Iran, but I doubt that even Bush is foolish enough to start an open war in the aftermath of the Iraqi mess. Besides opening up a new can of worms to be dealt with as far as another nation being \"liberated\", it is likely to bring significant backlash in Iraq, as the majority shia population is strongly supportive of Iran (in fact, the front running shia candidates are pushing for close ties with Iran). \n \n Since we would have to base our troops in Iraq, this does not bode well for success in such an endeavor. Surrounding yourself with th e enemy has only one advantage, you can shoot whichever way you please.",

   "As of this morning, Bush refused to rule out war with Iran. Yesterday, before the inauguration, Cheney stated that Iran is considered (by the US) as a major trouble spot and offered this little gem:\n \n ~Asked hypothetically whether the United States would yield to Israel in a scenario in which an attack against Tehran was being considered, he said, \"One of the concerns people have is that Israel might do it without being asked, that if in fact the Israelis became convinced the Iranians had a significant nuclear capability, given the fact that Iran has a stated policy that their objective is the destruction of the state of Israel, that the Israelis might well decide to act first and let the rest of the world worry about cleaning up the diplomatic mess afterward.\" ~\n \n I liked the 'without being asked' scenario, our favorite ME gunslinger being ready to do our bidding without being asked. Without our financial and military support Israel would be as poor as Palestine. \n \n Iran, with three times the population and four times the land mass of Iraq, fiercely anti-US and, unlike Iraq's former secular government, is belief system driven. Iran has a male population of military age almost the equivalent of Iraq's total population. And regardless of who starts it, the US or Israel, Iranian resistance would make the problems in Iraq look like a children's picnic. \n \n Israel and the US need GDP drivers to keep their public pacified, making war with Iran a very real potential scenario, more probable than not. Especially with sending a woman, Rice, as our representative in a situation where Muslim customs will take that as a slur by the US in any diplomatic negotiations.",
