I mean, all it would do is create a legal, viable option for those who want to own slaves. Heck, we could even put CHEKCS in place to control the activity of slave owners. Yeah, we could just disallow slavery above the southern border of Missouri. Now, you presumably would not take this position when it comes to slavery. So why would you take this position when it comes to whether we kill persons (or potential persons) or not?\n \n \n1. a woman who is considering an abortion can be made to consult both pro abortionists and anti abortionists who would tell her the risks and gains of both sides. after, with both sides presented to her, she should be made to consider her options by herself and choose. after all if she is bent on having an abotion would she not have one when there are so many options that are very risky including means that can be done at home?\n\n First, you say making abortion illegal would endanger the woman because she would seek out a more dangerous form of abortion, i.e. an illegal one. This is an interesting line of reasoning - one so far as I can tell only applies to pregnant women seeking abortions.\n \n For instance, we would not say that, since murder is extremely dangerous to someone who would murder, that we should therefore go ahead and provide a legal and safe means by which someone can murder another.\n \n Second, I think people who spout this line of reasoning, one that says women will seek abortions in spite of what the law says, is a very degrading position to take towards women. To suggest that untold numbers of women would ignore the law is to suggest that untold numers of women out there would gladly make hypocrites of themselves, for consider: \n \n these women assuredly expect others to abide by the law, especially laws that directly affect them. But, when a law is instituted that they don't like, one instituted to protect an unborn child, they would simply choose to ignore the law?\n \n Not only that, to suggest that untold numbers of women would seek illegal abortions is a question-begging claim that has no grounding in history, logic, or reason. It is an unfounded, unproven claim. It is a betrayal to sound judgment to make decisions based upon unfounded predictions into the future.\n \n \n3. legalisation can be used as a tool to fight illegal, extremely dangerous means of performing an abortion.\n\n So because a law making a specific action illegal will inevitably be broken, we shouldn't make the law? Ok, people murder others every day. Our laws against murder have inevitably been broken, therefore, we should just legalize murder.\n \n \nremember that NOTHING STOPS A WOMAN FROM HAVING AN ABORTION IF SHE WANTS TO HAVE ONE WITH ALL THE ILLEGAL OPTIONS AVAILABLE.\n\n Nothing stops someone from murdering another person if they want to do so.",

   "This is nothing more than discriminating against another human being based upon their stage of development.\n\n \n I am not discriminating on the basis of stages of development. After all, all stages are equally vital to the healthy baby being born. i must ask :\n Do you call an egg by the word \"chicken\" ? Or do you call a baby by the words \"senior citizen\"? \n There is a different name to each stage and it once more boils down to \"when does a foetus become a human being?\" who knows the correct answer?\n \n \nI labeled your arguments in support of abortion. \n \n In 1A), this is not a very good argument in support of abortion.

Is one less of a person because of the circumstances surrounding their conception?\n \n 2B)? What is mistrust?\n \n\n Thanks for labeling the problems I listed in my first presentation. \n \n 1A) Poverty. The statement is general. Is it right for a child to be brought into the world when the mother knows that he would have to suffer extreme hunger, have very shabby clothes, would have to work as soon as he can walk meaning that he shall have no childhood? No mother would want this for her child and hence some may want to abort the baby so as to prevent such hardships on the child. It is true that poverty would be classified differently but others and some may find that conditions I have described as being friction but the reality that there is extreme poverty in this world, equal to and exceeding what i have described, where to get the BASIC needs of life is a constant struggle.\n \n 1B) I am certainly not for killing people with disabilities. Would there be a mother out there who would not want her child to whom getting up every morning and walking is a constant struggle? Such a child would not only be physically restrained but would face mental hurdles. Somewhere there would be a mother who would feel that death might be a better option than such a life. (Keep in mind many who believe that death is not the end of a person!)\n \n 2A) it is true you can look at the problem of rape from that perspective. It one more goes to show that there is no one side to anything in life. Hence it is a debate. But some may feel that in such a circumstance, any sexual offence would have directly hurt the young woman involved and that the child is a representation of the agony and fear of the situation. it would be interesting to know how the mother may view the child if the foetus is not aborted or how a child might fee if he knows that the came not from love but from a malicious crime that prevented his mother from ever living a normal life (on her terms).\n \n 2B) mistrust is a general term for cases where a child is conceived and later the partner walks out on the potential mother. What is she to do in this case? Perhaps having a baby would make her an outcaste or may have ruined her life. This borders on another debate about sex before marriage and commitments but are we in the person's position to judge them?\n \n \n Abortion system? You consider abortion to be a system that needs checks and balances? \n\n I used the term \"abortion system\" in reference to it being legal and part of a state's law. I can change the term and there would be no threat to my argument.\n \n \nIf she wants to have an abortion, why shouldn't she just be able to have one? Why make her go through all these steps? \n\n \n What I was talking about was measures that can try to ensure that the mother is aware of the risks and is not making a rash decision.\n \n \n Do you consider it against the principles of democracy to outlaw slavery? \n\n \n Slavery and abortion are different things. There is no relevance with respect to slavery to this debate but for the record, do you know that many slaves practiced abortion as a means of opposition to the masters. The principles of democracy I am trying to entail are that everyone's view can be considered, with the legalisation of abortion. If you believe that you can abort, the choice is yours and if you are against it, do NOT practice it.\n \n \n Interestingly enough, abortion in the United States was made legal by the decision of seven men. Doesn't sound much like a principled democratic decision to me. \n\n \n Please look at the intended effect and not how the decision was made to comprehend why I think that legalisation goes hand in hand with democracy. Also I am not concerned about any one country, but all nations. abortion is a globa issue.\n \nFor someone who doesn't have a personal view about abortion... \n\n \n the reason I do not have a personal view is because I cannot choose if abortion is right or wrong AFTER deeply considering both sides of the argument.\n \n \nFirst, you say making abortion illegal would endanger the woman because she would seek out a more dangerous form of abortion, i.e. an illegal one. This is an interesting line of reasoning - one so far as I can tell only applies to pregnant women seeking abortions.\n \n For instance, we would not say that, since murder is extremely dangerous to someone who would murder, that we should therefore go ahead and provide a legal and safe means by which someone can murder another. \n\n \n laws were made to maintain order in society and hence i would not suggest that we legalise murder. \n \n \nSecond, I think people who spout this line of reasoning, one that says women will seek abortions in spite of what the law says, is a very degrading position to take towards women. To suggest that untold numbers of women would ignore the law is to suggest that untold numers of women out there would gladly make hypocrites of themselves, for consider: \n \n these women assuredly expect others to abide by the law, especially laws that directly affect them. But, when a law is instituted that they don't like, one instituted to protect an unborn child, they would simply choose to ignore the law?\n \n Not only that, to suggest that untold numbers of women would seek illegal abortions is a question-begging claim that has no grounding in history, logic, or reason. It is an unfounded, unproven claim. It is a betrayal to sound judgment to make decisions based upon unfounded predictions into the future.\n \n \n So because a law making a specific action illegal will inevitably be broken, we shouldn't make the law? Ok, people murder others every day. Our laws against murder have inevitably been broken, therefore, we should just legalize murder. \n\n \n There is no intention to degrade women and I do not mean the masses, but there are those who would break the law. Remember, too many people, the laws on earth does not necessarily mean that it is right. Also to use reasoning that murder should be legalized does not seem fair as laws are made to protect society not destroy it.",

   "But it is based on history. There is plenty of history showing that women had illegal abortions.\n\n The argument is not that some women will seek out deadly illegal abortions, but that countless numbers of women will seek out deadly illegal abortions. The common claim was that 5,000-10,000 women died due to complications suffered during illegal abortions. These numbers were never recorded and have now come under great dispute due to the fact that those who used them admitted that they made the numbers up.\n \n If you mean to argue, then, that though countless numbers would not die, a few likely would, and thus abortion must remain legal, I think the nature of the claim renders the argument a fallacy. This line of reasoning seems to be saying this: because a few people might break a law, we ought not make the law. But, we wouldn't accept this line of reasoning for any other action. We would never say that because some people break the laws against murder, we should therefore legalize murder. Though a law may be broken, that fact alone could never justify not making the law.\n \n \nWomen died or had severe medical emergencies due to illegal abortions. Doctors and nurses were prosecuted for providing these services.\n\n I certainly think that doctors who perform an illegal procedure should be prosecuted for doing so, especially if that procedure results in the death of his patients.",

   "\n the reason I do not have a personal view is because I cannot choose if abortion is right or wrong AFTER deeply considering both sides of the argument.\n \n\n \n What a refreshing and pragmatic outlook you have friend1.\n \n I think your view on abortion borders on the anarchistic (I'm not being derogatory by the way) as it places all responsibility for the decision with the individual with no restraints imposed. It is a solution that pleases everybody from a personal viewpoint, by runs into difficult ground because abortion tends to be such a polarising issue (ie. most people are not indifferent to when and how other people can have abortions) and even those who support abortion accept that conditions on their availability are essential.\n \n In essence though it is what most countries with legalised abortions permit currently- it is basically the choice of the individual if they want an abortion or not, so their own sense of morality/reality decides the matter.\n \n Hope you found that constructive ;)",

I shall clarify the point therefore:\n \n Cone appears to believe that anything that we currently allow adults to do (drive, have sex, get married, vote, watch porn movies, smoke, drink alchohol etc) should either be banned or we should let 3 year olds do those things too.\n \n Happy now?",
