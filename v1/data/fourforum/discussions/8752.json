   "Neodarwinism is a Joke\n \n If anyone wants to learn the truth about nature and about how animals supposedly change, all they have to do is take the Darwinists' playbook and play the opposite game. For instance: When they say natural selection is nonrandom, the reality is it's almost completely random. Next, when darwinists say that sexual selection is nonrandom, that too is actually random. When darwinists say we evolved from a one-celled organism, what's really true is we were all created perfectly and fully-formed. When darwinists claim that humans are no better than rats or cockroaches, the truth is humans are cherrished beings and rule over all animals. When darwinists say that mutations are random, those mutations are actually nonrandom. When darwinists say it takes billions of years to evolve, the truth is we evolve rapidly, sometimes instantaneously....which I will prove here. There is more real-life, truthful science in this one post than in all of every neodarwin book ever written.\n -------------------\n Molecular biology has learned it is not the genetic code that accounts for the difference between the mouse and the fly or between a virus and a chicken. This, evidently has been known for quite a while:\n \n Biochemical changes do not seem to be a main driving force in the diversification of living organisms...It is not biochemical novelty that generated diversification of organisms...What distinguishes a butterfly from a lion, a hen from a fly, or a worm from a whale is much less a difference in chemical constitutes than in the organization and the distribution of these constituents.\" Francois Jacob, a founding father of biochemical genetics, 1977.\n \n The researchers who cracked the genetic code immediately realized that it was universal. Sermonti\n \n In 1989, Hox genes (clusters of genes) were discovered in mice and worms. Soon after, it was realized that every creature on earth was constructed with the same clusters of genes. However these universal gene clusters manifested themselves in different animals, and thus, were responsible for different regions. \n \n For example, the same gene that's responsible for the tail of the mouse, as well is responsible for the rear extremities of the grasshopper. Sermonti\n \n So what is it that makes a mouse a mouse, a fly a fly? The fact is, no one knows....and from what I understand they will never know. One thing that is known, however, is that DNA is not the dictator of life that was once thought. It no longer assumes the role as life's grand generator of genetic information. \n \n It is not the genes that elicit nascent form, but the nascent form that selects the genes and recruits them for its program Sermonti\n \n It's clear to me that contemporary science has only one eye open to how nature really works. Instead of natural observations, science, instead has an obsession to dig below the surface and focus on genetics. It's a bizarre fixation on the flask and test tube. But there's a reason for this odd diversion...and it's because nature - as it truly operates - shatters theTheory of Evolution. Thus, the truth about how nature operates is very difficult to find. \n \n But it is true that every individual animal on earth is at one with his environment. It's the REAL way things \"evolve.\" - individually. And it starts at the moment of conception, when a mental and physical \"agreement\" of sorts forms -- and the animal melts and molds himself into his surroundings. This is when traits are passed from mother to daughter and/or formed by its habitat. It has nothing to do with genetics. Instead, specific traits are but responses to external stimuli that act on hormones. \n \n \n Very early on in the development of the embryo, the unformed organism begins a miraculous swirl of unexplainable self-organization. It also immediately starts receiving feedback. This feedback not only stems from its immediate surroundings, but from the external world as well -- through parental hormones. It's the beginning of a lifelong relationship. No doubt when we were developing in our mother's womb, we learned to recognize our mother and father's voices. Thus our minds began to be imprinted by their loving presence. In fact, the mind begins the process of receiving all kinds of stimuli...and this stimuli not only helps form mental and emotional traits, but physical traits as well. It's the marvelous beginning of a relationship between a new life and the outside world. \n \n The developing embryo responds with little shocks and shivers as these discharges go about shaping the body. Sermonti\n \n The mind and the world arise together. Fransico Varela\n \n Morphogenesis is a process that depends on stresses and relaxations . Lev Belousso\n \n The soul is that excitable little something that awakens when the sperm and egg embrace In the early embryo, forces are activated that evoke the form of the body, bringing it into relationship with the outside world. Sermonti\n \n And my hypothesis is the smaller the creature, the more quickly adaptive it is. Likewise, animals that are more \"liquid\" (i.e. octopus, fish, etc) are very quickly adaptive. Thus a lion will be slower to adapt than adapt than a dog. A full-sized human is less adaptive than a baby. A bear is less adaptive than a fox. And this is proven by the fact that lots of smaller arctic animals can change fur color over the seasons (the hare, fox, weasel, squirrel, etc)...while deer and bears generally take longer - years possibly. But it can and does happen. I suggest every animal on earth has this ability, just in varying degrees and varying timeframes.\n \n \n Life is made up of countless, unexpressed designs for life. Goethe\n \n But like I say, the smaller the creature, the more flexible it is. So is it any wonder that our lives started out in microscopic and in liquid form?...it's when we were at our most adaptive state....it's when we are not yet formed, yet have the ability to generate multiple forms based on internal signals and external stimuli. These signals start the process of transformation. This is partly how our destiny is decided, as proven here:\n \n http://www.sicb.org/meetings/2003/symposia...plasticity.php3\n \n I submit that every animal develops different traits like the butterfly. And this is because all animals have consciousness and inherent intelligence in their genomes - and this intelligence works off external cues, which, for example, can help a lizard change colors or re-grow a lost limb or tail. The idea that the body can do this without the mind or internal intelligence is absurd. There could be no regeneration of the tail if there's not some sort of consciousness, thought, or intelligence behind it.\n \n The fact is, countless creatures can quickly change color - or emerge in a different color -- in response to an environmental change. There is no genetic change, it's simply the result of a psychological phenomenon during development - or even later in life. I believe peppered moths are a perfect example. Of course you will never read this at a neo-darwin website because the reality of morphological plasticity is often withheld in such places. But like mammals, fish, lizards, frogs and other insects, moths have the ability to quickly change colors without a long genetic journey or death to a large segment of their population. Mind over matter...not matter over mind. That's how our world was Created.\n \n http://ourfcs.friendscentral.org/moths/polyphenism1.html\n \n \n But Darwin's theory of evolution suggests that it's matter over mind - and that animals change so they can become something different....I however, suggest that every animal changes so they can stay who they are...it's the mind in action that keeps nature steady. It's much like when my kids first learned to walk. There was lots of wobbling from side-to-side going on, but it was all that wobbling that allowed them to stay on their feet. It's no different with animals....animals wobble back and forth physically so they can avoid falling over (extinction). And since scientists cannot find even ONE airtight intermediate fossil, then I suggest that this is all there is to so-called \"evolution.\" Ultimately, very little is left to chance...Nature does not operate by flipping coins. \n \n \n Things are as they are because they were as they were. Rupert Sheldrake\n \n Darwinists may try to claim that these abilities were evolved. But the problem lies here: DNA can no more create evolutionary change in animals than a single, unfertilized egg can create a baby: --(the following quote is very important)\n \n \n One of the fundamental principles of molecular biology (now enshrined as Central Dogma) assigned to DNA the role of absolute governor of the life and inheritance for the cell, and consequently for the organism. The Central Dogma proclaimed: DNA reproduces itself and produces proteins; proteins do not reproduce themselves and are unable to modify the DNA that encoded them. In other words, the information proceeds from DNA to DNA and from DNA to proteins, but it never makes the return journey from proteins to DNA......The egg makes the hen; the hen doesn't really make the egg - she merely lays eggs that derive directly form the egg that made her. In the new molecular version, DNA was the egg and proteins the hen..... Sermonti\n \n ....DNA is not the primary container of genetic information. Sermonti\n \n So what does this mean? It means that since DNA is neither the starting point, nor the ending point. And it could not have played the role in evolution as Darwinists claim. DNA is merely a part of the never-ending circle of life. It's merely a spoke in the genetic wheel; a curve in the spiral of life.\n \n And the reason evolutionists don't admit that information makes a round trip within the body is because they do not want to admit that acquired characteristics can be inherited....which is what this would indicate. I believe this is why evolutionists have long shouted-down larmarcksim -- which basically says the mechanism of inheritance (the genes contained in our sexual cells) can be effected by the external environment. This is a mortal blow to their theory. Thus, they insist that the genetic system is a one-way street. Information can go out...but it can't come back in, and it certainly cannot be passed on and/or used to alter the characteristics of a future offspring. Evolutionists insist on chance. And this is the anti-chance in action. Yet...cracks are starting to form:\n \n \n http://www.newscientist.com/channel/life/g...f-genetics.html\n \n Mendelian inheritance, the central tenet of genetics, is under attack from a few scrawny weeds that have not read the textbooks. The weeds are somehow inheriting DNA sequences from their grandparents that neither of their parents possessed - which is supposed to be impossible. (quote from above link)\n \n See, with acquired characteristics, my thought is the following: Traits such as muscle-building or any other physically acquired trait is probably not able to be acquired. However, traits that are stimulated by hormones could very possibly be acquired. If this were found to be true, the inexplicable circle of life would be undeniable:\n \n God is a circle whose center is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere Empedocles \n \n According to these observations, genetic information is not like a ward where babies are born but rather like a registry office where citizens can check their vital statistics and make them complete again if any have been lost. Sermonti\n \n And as it turns out, traits such as color, pigmentation, eye color, hair color, etc are often modified by only one gene, one nucleotide of over 5 billion. This would require only a simple mutation or a signal in the developing embryo to change the organism:\n \n There are several different kinds of variations of the phenotype that can be induced by the environment, and many of them can lead to long-term changes in a population....there are some variations in the phenotype that can result from changes in the DNA sequence.......The mutations I am calling for are those that show evidence of being nonrandom in that they are triggered by the environment. Some of them have been seen to be adaptive. These mutations could lead to observed evolution. These mutations act as switches triggered by the environment that switch the genome to one of preexisting set of potential states to produce an adaptive phenotype. (slightly shortned/paraphrased) Spetner\n \n In the model of the heritable switch, a change in the environment sends a signal to each member of the population. This signal activates a genetic command in each individual to call up a preprogrammed subroutine, If the new environment does not last long, the population will revert to its previous state. But if the new environment persists for a long enough time, then even after the environment changes, the population will remain in its new state. The new state is carried into future generations, and to this extent is heritable. The heritability is, however not absolute. A different cue can make the population change again. But the longer the environmental cue lasts, the more nearly heritable the effect appears. Spetner.\n \n But like I said before, today's science seems to be obsessed on genes, while turning a blind eye on real nature. And the reason for this is because a few lingering scientists are holding out faith that by studying mere genes they can somehow/someday learn to construct a new species of animal. But this is proving to be impossible. And the reason it's impossible is because even though there are such thing as \"blue eye genes\" and \"dark skin genes,\" there are no such things as \"mouse genes\" or \"cat genes.\" And that's because the greatest differences in life are not dictated by genes. Instead, genes are dictated by life's differences. The sun is not orbiting the earth, the earth is orbiting the sun. Science is has turned a blind eye to half of the story.\n \n Thus, ultimately it seems in order for a fish to evolve into a reptile, the invisible internal program that dictates the genes for a fish, must somehow evolve into a program that dictates the genes for a reptile. This, of course, is absurd and defies all rationality. Thus, evolution, at least as neo-darwinists define it, is no longer breathing.\n \n The potential for adaptivity to the environment already exists in the genome. The environment just triggers it.

   "The fact is you guys are living a miracle and you cannot see it. You have blinded yourselves by putting your faith in a worthless, and wrong theory. The fact is every animal in the world develops in direct response to their environment. Everything is directed. The following link will show you how plasticity works. It's a mind-blowing concept that effects everything about the animals. In tadpoles for instance, the following can be shown.\n \n 1) in the presence of a predator eggs can hatch at earlier times:\n \n ..... Flatworms (Phagocotus gracilis) were used as\n predators or predator chemical cues upon salamander larvae (Ambystoma texanum and Ambystoma barbouri). The presence of the flatworms and their cues induced the eggs to delay their hatching time. This resulted in larger, and more advanced hatchlings. This finding supports the earlier field observations that the flatworm preyed heavily on smaller, less developed hatchlings. This shift in hatch time is adaptive and supports\n greater hatchling survival (Sih and Moore 1993).\n \n 2) specific morphological changes happen due to predators: \n \n In 1997 McCollum and Leimberger examined the morphological changes that\n arose in the gray treefrog (Hyla chrysoscelis) in response to the presence of a predatory dragonfly (Aesha umbrosa). The larvae that were reared in the presence of the predator differed in shape and in color than those that were reared in predator free environments. The treatments exposed tadpoles to tail damage and to chemical cues of the dragonfly feeding on conspecifics. The tadpoles responded plastically by altering their color and tail shape. The tail was extended, presumably increasing swimming speed and hence\n survivorship. The color change was seen in the tail. The appearance of color on the tail is thought to attract predatory attacks on the tail rather than on the body.\n \n 3) specific behavior changes as a result of predators\n \n Larval anurans have demonstrated phenotypic plasticity in response to variation in food availability (Anholt 1998). It has been argued that food availability and predation risk are intertwined. This can be demonstrated when food resources in an environment are high, search time by prey is reduced and predation success may suffer. During times of limited\n food availability search time may be lengthened, thus increasing prey vulnerability to predation (Anholt and Werner 1998). In the presence of predators, search time is reduced as activity is restricted to avoid predation. This leads to a reduction of food intake or starvation in environments with low food availability\n \n ....and this study is just on predators....the fact is EVERYTHING in the environment helps to shape and mold the organism.\n \n http://www.fiu.edu/~donnelly/termpaperex1.pdf#search='plasticity%20body%20structure'",

You state that phenotype changes rapidly (ie-within 3 generations) based on environment, but genotype remains the same (I'm getting this from his posts on IIDB btw). If this is your position, then my question:\n \n \nbased on your \"plasticity\" theory, why are there still \"black\" people in the Americas? They were brought over from Africa a couple centuries ago, surely they (and the Europeans who've been here for just as long) should have developed the proper \"red\" skin thats perfectly adapted to life in the Americas, right?\n\n \n is completely valid. Your response to this was nothing more than handwaving.

He was saying that PE is nothing revolutionary, that it was simply a restatement of a pattern that was already predicted by neo-darwinian evolution. What he criticizes is the way Eldredge and Gould presented it, as if it ran counter to the modern synthesis of the time.\n \n \nThe 'gaps', far from being annoying imperfections or awkward embarrassments, turn out to be what we should positively expect, if we take seriously our orthodox neo-Darwinian theory of speciation. ... instead [Eldredge and Gould] chose, especially in their later writings in which they were eagerly followed by journalists, to sell their ideas as being radically opposed to Darwin's and opposed to the neo-Darwinian synthesis. [240-241]\n \n [...]\n The fact is that, in the fullest and most serious sense, Eldredge and Gould are really just as gradualist as Darwin or any of his followers. It is just that they would compress all the gradual change into brief bursts, rather than having it go on all the time; and they emphasise that most of the gradual change goes on in geographical areas away from the areas where most fossils are dug up.\n \n So it is not really the gradualism of Darwin that the punctuationists oppose: gradualism means that each generation is only slightly different from the previous generation; you would have to be a saltationist to oppose that, and Eldredge and Gould are not saltationists.

Gould played a bit on the politics of science, presenting PE as \"contrary\" (somewhat) so that it would get more attention than it otherwise may have. It's not that PE is bunk, or that gradual change is bunk, it's that Gould wanted the fuss for publicity.",

The timeframe of evolution since the emergence of life is the same--it's taken billions of years.
