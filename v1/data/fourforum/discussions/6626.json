   "Me too.\n \n http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=5658\n \n From what I gather, and that is very little, the election was indecisive; Merkel and Shroeder, within their respective [possible] coalitions, couldn't get the required 50% of votes. The SPD and the CDU weren't prepared to go into a coalition with some of the 'smaller' more extreme parties, so the result was a stalemate.\n \n Recently, I think Merkel became the new Chancellor (is that right?). I'm not sure if she can do a lot though. I think she doesn't have the required support to pass any larger new measures.\n \n I think both sides are (or appear?) too stubborn to concede points, which will result in very little change. \n \n That said I know little of German politics as the British media isn't that interested in them. The only mentioned of Germany for the next few years will be in relation to the World Cup.:p\n \n -Wez",
