   "If the answer is yes, you better have blonde hair, be between the ages of 14-24 , female, white, and have bad loud mouth parents. If you don't fall into this category I suggest you don't get yourself lost on some island or killed by a bikini top.\n \n I understand that ever murder to tragic but I have a hard time believing that the only tragic deaths are the ones covered by Fox News. Too bad that girl in Durham, NC wasn't a pretty blonde hair white girl or people might actually believe her! I'm not claiming \"racisim\" here or anything but it does seem a little odd when you see \"Blonde hair white girl missing!\" every night on Greta (Fox News) for OVER A YEAR.\n \n Perhaps we can expand...or rather be fair with....the reporting of missing or murdered persons. I'd hate to see a report on me going missing...\"man missing...probably raped 10 people while running away from his drug habit\". Thanks Fox! Way to get the true story emoticon_rolleyes",
