   "THe only connection that has been provn between Iraq and terroism is that Saddam supported Hamas (the palestenian social oranization that DOES have a militant arm). MOst countries in the middle eat have supported or do suppor Hamas, including kuwait, jordan and Saudi (though Saudi does it indirectly). The question becomes in this instance \"Is hamas a terrorist organisation\". THe answer is rather difficult, since, whil they do carry out attacks against Israeli citizens, they also meet the legal definition of \"freedom fighter\" since israel is occupying their territory.\n \n THEre has never been any kind of real link between Saddam Hussein and Al Queda or any other terrorist organisation that we are aware of or have been able to prove. The three big pieces of \"evidence\" that have surfaced that may suggest a link between saddam and terrorists are:\n \n A major terrorist had heart surgery at the baghdad hospital and was there for a few months----This has been kind of passed over as conclusive evidence by the intelligence community since we now know the guy entered the country under a false passport and there is a good chance that the IRaqis didn;t even know he was there. \n \n Osama Bin LAden called Saddam before the US invasion----For a while this was considered pretty damning evidence as printed in the US press, until Al Jazeera got ahold of the whole tape and played it in its entirety. Bin LAden starts by introducing himself foramlly, Saddam follows suit. They certainly do not appear from the tape to actually know each other.\n \n There have been links proven between IRaqi intelligence agents and Al Queda operatives-----The biggie involved a senior Iraqi intelligence agent contacting one of the 9/11 hojackers in Prauge. Since then, the FBI has confirmed that teh hijacer wa laready in the US and did not leave, and could not possible have been there for the alleged meeting. THere have been smaller links made between Iraqi intel and people who are connected to Al Queda, but there are at least 6 other countries friendly to the us who we hnow have connections in Al Queda. When pressed, the CIA director admitted that the CIA has closer toes to Al Queda than the IRaqis apparently did, as did the mossad and MI5.\n \n BAsically, there is absolutly no credible evidence of a link between Saddam and Terrorists. IT is a loosing point, you may want to try another tactic when debating.",

The WMD's that were never found, lack of credible link from Iraq to Al Queda and 9/11, going against the UN, going against the rest of the world, not securing Baghdad after the early conflict resulting in massive luting and destruction that we are now having to rebuild, apparently not realizing the difficulty of uniting the different \"religious factions\" under one rule, mistreating their prisoners, etc., etc. I'm going to sum it up in one selfish statement, \"I don't want any part of middle east \"politics\" and I feel we are much more vulnerable to terrorist attacks as a result of our involvement\".

   "I think I understand your points but do you think that the American public would have been only close as afraid after an attack on GE as it was after the attack on the WTC?\n The terrorists are smart; the US reaction to 9/11 was war and this didn't come as a surprise, so imo the terrorists could take the billions of dollars that the current administration spends on the 'war on terrorism' into their account.\n It is not just the economical backlash at the stock market and the war costs, it is also the costs for the new 'office for home security' (don't know the name right now...Tom Ridge is chief iirc) and the money that US citizens spend on useless stuff or not at all because they are scared.\n \n So my opinion, summed up, is that the terrorists did economical harm anyway and therefore chose to take a symbolic target for their attack, too. If I were terrorist I'd rather taken the White House or the Capitol but maybe they were a bit unsure what this could trigger. \n \n \n ...And now that I've read your post one more time I see that I just repeated your stance more or less. ;)",

   "Considering the effect 9/11 had/has to this day on the airline and tourist industry, I'd say they struck a pretty powerful financial nerve. How many days did we shut off all air traffic? What was the loss to destination locations like Las Vegas, Disneyland, Atlantic City, etc. In addition, as George said, the total financial loss to this country is immeasurable. Especially if you consider all the money we're still spending for our so-called security measures. emoticon_rolleyes",

   "I definatly see the value of their present plan, and would agree that it is a winning hand they are holding. It sems to me, that hitting our industrial infrastructure would be a more effective means of attack. When you calculate the cost of the programs we have already implemented and consider the very limited benifit we are likely to get from them, it just seems to me that changing tactics at tis point would be benificial to them, not to mention that it would be a welcome relief to see them blowing up factories as opposed to their goal being inflicting mass casuaties on the civilian population.\n\n \n That would make sense to the terrorists as a financial strategy since, when compared to public security, we're currently devoting few resources to industrial security. And those are fairly soft targets with normally open access. That would drain us on two fronts as the public security wouldn't be relaxed for political purposes and our National Guard, for all practical purposes, is already deployed. At $30 billion for Homeland Security (probably closer to $40 billion if the military resources commonly utilized were added) plus another $30 billion for industrial security, that would be approaching 20% of our declared national budget, not affordable for any extended period of time with declining revenues, grossly expanding debt and the incalcuable revenue loses resulting from an industrial slow-down. I'm currently receiving policy amendments from my insurers that pointedly include acts of terrorism with the acts of war clauses. Acts of war coverage cost is getting up there with living right on the banks of the Mississippi River in Springtime, so the actuaries are obviously looking at that possibility. \n \n Add that to the cost of Iraq, current federal law enforcement resource costs for the war on terror (never disclosed) and the loss of commerce from 9/11 and it almost seems like the terrorists did a close study of how Regan's administration accelerated cold war expenditures to break the USSR. \n \n We're truly riding the tiger.",

   "Most Americans fail to understand that the USSR was defeated by economics, or that our efforts at massively expensive, mostly useless internal security, expanding conventional military forces with megabucks technology while maintaining old, useless systems to prop up book values of defense industries and expending our resources on wild goose chases are falling right in line with any subversive dream.\n\n \n Sorry for going off-topic, but I would like to point out that there is also a political dimension to the fall of the USSR. While I`m sure that economics played an important role in the series of events that ultimatly led to the disolvement of the Soviet Union, I would argue that the aspect of political conviction and dissent was even more important. Michael Gorbatjovs decission to implement Glasnost and Perestrojka was only partially caused by the economic failiures of planned economy. It was also aimed at curing the political problems of the proletarian dictatorship. And it was political dissenters that tore down the iron curtain by exercising their newly acquired freedoms. And it was not economic implications that stayed Gorbatjovs hand during the velvetrevolution in 1989, it was his political conviction. And the last nail Soviets coffin was not caused by economic factors. It was a political power game, skillfully played by Boris Jeltsin and his allies.",

I apologize for inferring it was the primary factor in dissolving the USSR.",

   "i seriously doubt the terrorists acted as an economic attack on 911. they would have made much more impact by attacking the oil infrastructures in the ME, hurting both \"western proped up corrupt governments\" and the world economy in general. since the US has the largest national economy in the world, and the EU largest international economy in the world, this would have made much more sense.\n the terrorists acted on 911 as a political attack. again here i doubt their expectations that the US would respond with war in afghanistan or iraq. reviews of Bin Laden statements, and review of US foreign policies for the past 30 years would seem to suggest that the US would withraw in response. Vietnam, Beirut, Somalia are to name just a few.\n I also doubt they acted soley because of US actions in the ME. Al Qaeda is not a state sponsored organization. even the Taliban took exception to them but foolishly did not wish to offer him to the west out of a misplaced sense of anti-westernism and religious fundamentalism loyalty. Al Qaeda exists partly out of disagreement with the direction and governance of Saudi Arabia at least as supported by the US, resentment of US treatment of Iraq, and the preeminence of western culture over arab one world wide. Arab terrorist still want to reclaim their lost territory not just in Israel but Spain as well.\n Those who believe a US withrawal from the ME will assuage terrorist actions are mistaken.\n \n did you know we have already met one of Bin Laden's demand and yet he has made very little of it.",
