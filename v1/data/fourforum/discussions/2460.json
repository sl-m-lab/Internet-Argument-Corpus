What is going on here?\n \n Because this VPC site says they are trying to renew the Brady bill:\n \n http://www.banassaultweapons.org/\n \n OK so if I understand this correctly, the VPC wants to renew a law that according to thier own literature is ineffective, not working, and full of holes?\n \n If your anti-gunner, does this just strike you as wrong?",

And force me to change magazines every ten rounds.\n \n P.S. WHen is building your product to comply with the law 'circumventing the law?' Should we ban SUV's because when laws were put on to increase fuel mileage, the car manufactures made them get better gas mileage?",
