Why did most scientist agree with Piltdown Man or Nebraska man? It proves nothing in most cases. In the case of gravity it seems to make sense as most items heavier than air tend to fall to earth. Dinos to birds is a worldview not a scientific opinion. IT did it.\n As far as the Bible you should read it sometime. It is full of things we did not know until very recently like ocean currents , what caused the wind , to wash after touching dead bodies and many , many more.

   "Jack and the beanstalk is as proven as the evolution of molecules to man and much more intelligently presented.\n\n \n Well, I will have to say something about that.\n \n \n~Jack and the Beanstalk Refuted~\n \n Scientists have claimed for years that Jack and the Beanstalk is, without doubt, a historical fact. For, as we all know, beanstalks grow extremely fast and can reach into the sky, where giants live. Scientist claims go so far as to say that Jack (which anti-jacks claim is an alias) did indeed sell a cow for magic beans. But where is the evidence?\n \n We have gotten an exclusive interview with the cow, who was said to be sold for those magic beans. We asked her if she recalled the exchange, and in response we were told flatly, \"Moooo.\" And so, if the magic beans didn't come from selling the cow, where did they come from? An anti-jack explains, \"There is no other way to come by magic beans, it's impossible without selling a cow. I've studied this for years and there just isn't any other way.\"\n \n With this information uncovered hopefully people will stop believing this urban legend. Too many years, people have believed a story so false. We hope that you will think the next time you put your faith into a simple Aesop's fable.\n\n \n And that is me making fun of what you just said.\n \n As for evidence for evolution, you suggest that it is molecules to man. Which it is, but it only takes some four and half billion years (hmmmmm, actually I'll have to look into that. I forget, but that might be the age of the universe.). You nor I can even begin to comprehend what a single million years is, let alone 4,500 million years.\n \n Evolution starts out as an itty bitty single-celled organism (yes, it starts out that way. Evolution is not how life started out, but what happened after it started), one of the most simple you can imagine, and every time it reproduces it gets a little better and a little better. Eventually some of the bacteria become so different from the others that you might even say they are, gasp,not the same species. How is that not a good enough theory. It happens today, some scientists watch it happen.\n \n I'm convinced that many people who disagree with evolution, haven't really understood it yet. If they do understand it, and just disagree because they really don't believe it, then I'm very surprised. And the site you've shown me only makes my contempt for misinformation and ignorance grow.\n \n *Please note that the section of this post (the quoted bit about jack and the beanstalk) was made entirely by me, to make fun of this comment: \"Jack and the beanstalk is as proven as the evolution of molecules to man and much more intelligently presented.\" And although I believe that Jack and the Beanstalk is a very well put together story and very intriguing to those under six, it is complete fiction.*",

I do, however, predict that during this decade Goldschmidt will be largely vindicated in the world of evolutionary biology.\n \n \n This letter was after DNA . DNA did not help the evolution theory it proved information theory . Read what Crick said:\n \n \n \"An honest man, armed with all the knowledge available to us now, could only state that in some sense, the origin life appears at the moment to be almost a miracle, so many are the conditions which would have had to have been satisfied to get it going.\" (Crick, Francis H.C.

It is difficult enough to study what is happening now. To try to figure out exactly what happened in evolution is even more difficult. Thus evolutionary arguments can usefully be used as hints to suggest possible lines of research, but it is highly dangerous to trust them too much. It is all too easy to make mistaken inferences unless the process involved is already very well understood. (pp. 138-139; emphasis in original.)

   "The picture is bogus. Unless you can offer a specific reference, I will reject your claim that it is from a biology text as a lie. The text at the bottom of the picture says, \"Richard B. Goldschmidt The Material Basis of Evolution Yale University Press 1940 p.395.\" That is apparently a reference to a publication by Goldschmidt, but the reference to punctuated equilibrium is phoney. Goldschmidt never used that term. That term was coined by Eldredge and Gould in reference to their theory, which is not a \"revival\" of the hopeful monster theory. One must be terribly ignorant to make such a claim. It borders on stupidity. And finally, the essay that you keep citing and refering to as a discussion of punctuated equilibrium isn't. It is a discussion of some points that Goldschmidt had put forth. What Gould is saying is that although most of what Goldschmidt said was wrong, he was correct on some points. Specifically what Gould is saying is that he believes that there are genes that control the sequence of development in an embryonic organism, and that changes in the timing of the action of these genes would have profound effects on the morphology of the organism while yet allowing perfect interfertility. Remember that the essay that you keep quoting was written in 1977 and published in \"Natural History\" magazine. It was later published in a collection of Gould's essays entitled The Panda's Thumb in 1980. I know the title was, \"Return of the Hopeful Monster,\" but Gould liked to use catchy titles. Anyone of intelligence who understands evolutionary theory and is familiar with Gould and his thoughts and style, is quite aware that he is not stating the Goldschmidt was correct. If fact, it seems that you didn't read you own reference because he says as much. At first blush, it seems remarkable that Gould would propose something like this in 1977. Is it a prediction? I don't think so. It's hard to remember back that far to know what kinds of hypotheses were being tossed around, but I think that Gould was just repeating some of the major thoughts being worked on. The problem is that he saw a link to what Goldschmidt had said more than 30 years previously, and he said so. What Gould is talking about was verified in 1983 (I looked it up) and about which had done a redux in 1979, in his essay, Helpful Monsters, in which he discussed homeotic mutations, the name that had been given to that type of mutation by then. But the specific genes were not verified until 1983, as I said. Those genes are the homeobox or HOX genes. Many of the homeodomain proteins that they encode have been identified (they are enzymes), and the subsequent actions of other genes that are trigered by these proteins.\n \n Again, this is not a revival of the hopeful monster hypothesis, nor is it some aspect of punctuated equilibrium. A mutation in a HOX gene may produce a significant effect in morphology without making the carrier sexually incompatible. A mutation of an early development gene is then subjected to natural selection, first as to whether the embryo is viable and then whether it is advantageous in a given environment. Least of all is any of the above discussion a denial or a replacement of natural selection.\n \n It is ignorant beyond belief to claim that Gould, in effect, was talking about punctuated equilibrium in every essay he wrote. Your little cartoon isn't from a biology text, as you claim, and the linking of punctuated equilibrium with a 65 years old discredited publication (over 35 years old at the time that Eldredge and Gould proposed the theory) is an intentional effort to deceive. I asked if the picture was from \"Pandas and People,\" and I suspect it may be.\n \n (a parenthetical BWAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA: While checking out amazon.com on the \"text\" \"Pandas and People,\" I found that it cites 13 sources. And this is supposed to be a biology text? I have a biolgy text and I looked at the list of sources cited. It is 41 large pages of small type. A bit more than the 13 citations required by creationists.)\n \n And again I ask, what book of Gould's should we read. You chided someone (Trebor I think) by asking if he had read Gould's book. What book? I have 13 of them and I don't have them all. And I ask again, have you read the original paper on punctuated equilibria published in 1972 in \"Models of Paleobiology\"? How can you claim to speak about punk eek if you have not?\n \n I think that it is wonderful that you linked the actual essay by Gould, published in 1977 and included in a collection of his essays published in 1980. But where in that essay does he mention about punctuated equilibria? You seem to think that Gould can't talk about anything else. Also notice that Gould mentions the cite from the picture in that essay. Maybe someone has duped you. It seems so.\n \n I think that it is quite telling that your last response to me is actually little more than feeble insults. It seems that you know that you are babbling and have decided to further embarrass yourself by resorting to insult. Good luck. Everyone sees it. You can't answer a single objection or question and must fall back on insult.",

Punk eek is more about plain old evolution in peripheral populations, followed by a migration event. Why do you keep ignoring Niles Eldredge? Punk eek is as much his theory as Goulds. The essay that you keep quoting and linking was not about punk eek. I have explained it to you before, but it seems that you know so little about science and evolutionary theory that you are incapable of understanding.\n \n In fact, you chided others for not reading \"Gould's book\" without specifying what book. I know you thought that Gould wrote a book called \"The Return of the Hopeful Monster,\" didn't you. He didn't. It was an essay that was published in Natural History magazine. It was republished in one of the collections of his essays (there are 10 such collections in book form and at least 10 other books by Gould). It is clear that you haven't read \"Gould's book.\" But we have come to expect such dishonesty from a creationist.\n \n By the way, the essay that you find so impressive is found in the second collection of essays, \"The Panda's Thumb.\" I have the 1st 7 of his collected essays on natural history. I've been meaning to get the other three. I also have several of his other books. So, yes. I have read Gould's book[s].\n \nHe said the fossils don't support it. He and Patterson both said that and they were 2 of the world's leading experts.\n\n Do you know what else Gould said? He said that people who take his words out of context like you have done are stupid. Patterson said that people who use his comments that were directed at a group of systematicists and secretly recorded by a creationist were liars.

It is a theory designed to fit the evidence. It ia great example of circular reasoning.\n When Gould and Eldridge came up with punctuated equilibrium it was simply another flavor of the hopeful monster idea. Instead of dinosaurs having baby birds changes happened quickly in geologic time in isolated populations. \n It cannot be falsified by the fossil evidence as Gould had long since realized gradualism had .\n You can believe it has no relation to Goldshmidts idea and Gould said what he did out of pity if you like.\n \n \n So Patterson says that Creationist secretly taped his interview with the BBC ? And you accept that? He did not actually write the letter stating there was not one transistional fossil alive or dead ?\n Is this the conversation he intended to start?\n \n \"One of the reasons I started taking this anti-evolutionary view, was ... it struck me that I had been working on this stuff for twenty years and there was not one thing I knew about it. That's quite a shock to learn that one can be so misled so long...so for the last few weeks I've tried putting a simple question to various people and groups of people. Question is: Can you tell me anything you know about evolution, any one thing that is true? I tried that question on the geology staff at the Field Museum of Natural History and the only answer I got was silence. I tried it on the members of the Evolutionary Morphology Seminar in the University of Chicago, a very prestigious body of evolutionists, and all I got there was silence for a long time and eventually one person said, 'I do know one thing -- it ought not to be taught in high school'. Keynote address at the American Museum of Natural History November 5, 1981 \"\n \n Or that Gould did not mean that lack of evidence for gradualism in the the fossil record meant there was a lack of of such evidence in the fossil record?\n Or he was just kidding about Lyell?\n \n \"Stephen Jay Gould Professor of Zoology and Geology at Harvard University \"\n \n \"In fact, the catastrophists were much more empirically minded than Lyell. The geologic record does seem to record catastrophes: rocks are fractured and contorted; whole faunas are wiped out (see my column of October, 1974). To circumvent this literal appearance, Lyell imposed his imagination upon the evidence. The geologic record, he argued, is extremely imperfect and we must interpolate into it what we can reasonably infer but cannot see. The catastrophists were the hardnosed empiricists of their day, not the blinded theological apologists. Natural History February 1975 pp.16-17\"\n \n We are glorious accidents of an unpredictable process with no drive to complexity, not the expected results of evolutionary principles that yearn to produce a creature capable of understanding the mode of its own necessary construction. \n Stephen Jay Gould \n \n \n The most erroneous stories are those we think we know best - and therefore never scrutinize or question. \n Stephen Jay Gould \n \n Human consciousness arose but a minute before midnight on the geological clock. Yet we mayflies try to bend an ancient world to our purposes, ignorant perhaps of the messages buried in its long history. Let us hope that we are still in the early morning of our April day. \n Stephen Jay Gould \n \n Nothing is more dangerous than a dogmatic worldview - nothing more constraining, more blinding to innovation, more destructive of openness to novelty. \n Stephen Jay Gould\n \n \n",

   "peddler8111,\n \n Just like you cling to ancient mythology, peddler8111, you cling to out of date quotes. The Patterson quote is from a 1982 BBC interview. So in spite of what Patterson said or what he meant, lots has gone on since that interview. Since then there have been numerous feathered dinosaurs discovered in the fossil record. There is the coelurosaurian, Sinosauropteryx. The tyrannosauroid Dilong paradoxus is a 128 million year old fossil with beatufully preserved feathers. And of course, there are the many examples of the maniraptoriformes that have been found with preserved feathers, like Ornithomimus and examples of the maniraptorians Caudipteryx, Oviraptor, and Beipiaosaurus. Then there are the troodontids like Mei and Troodon, and the dromaeosaurs like Sinornithosaurus, Bambiraptor, and Microraptor. So the theory of avian descent from dinosaurs has become pretty secure.\n \n Your second quote is by one of two ornithologists who opposes the theory of the dinosaurian ancestry of birds. The other, also often quoted by creationists, is Alan Feduccia. Both of these men do not oppose evolution, and certainly not the evolution of birds. The quote that you give, from 1999 is also out of context. What Olson and Feduccia prefer is evolution of birds from some root archosaur. Of course, the archosaur lineage is much more ancient than the dinosaurs. Archosaurs gave rise to the crocodilains as well as the Ornithodirans that includes the pterosaurs as well as the dinosaurs. The problem with that theory is that there is no fossil record to support it. It is based on a study of morphology and embryology that is not all that secure.\n \n You may not see it in the above discussion, but crocodilians are not dinosaurs by any rational classification. And as was pointed out, monitor lizards are reptiles that branched from the diapsids, which also gave rise to the archosaurs. None of them had a rock as an ancestor. You've been listening to Mr. Hovind too much.",

These contingencies will concur only rarely, and after enormously long intervals. Whilst the bed of the sea is stationary or is rising, or when very little sediment is being deposited, there will be blanks in our geological history.

I did -you did not. You are making this up as you go along and it shows.\n He meant more than could be counted by one man in his lifetime not 5.\n That is what he meant, it was not hyperbole.

The religion comment is stupid.\nIt's been dead it just won't go away.\n \n Michael Ruse , the evolutionist said this:\n \n Evolution is promoted by its practitioners as more than mere science. Evolution is promulgated as an ideology, a secular religion-a full-fledged alternative to Christianity, with meaning and morality. ... Evolution is a religion. This was true of evolution in the beginning, and it is true of evolution still today.... Evolution therefore came into being as a kind of secular ideology, an explicit substitute for Christianity.'12\n This is especially significant because Ruse had also testified with the ACLU in the same trial as Gould, and at that time dismissed the idea that evolution was religion.\n \n\n I'm no one. You can quote from whomever you like. I'm just telling you that most of your argument is taking quotations out of context, or just quoting quotations that are out of date.\nYou ignore evidence anyway. This is recent. Are you more qualified that the curator of birds for the Smithsonian?\n \n National Museum of Natural History\n Smithsonian Institution\n Washington, D. C. 20560\n \n 1 November 1999\n \n OPEN LETTER TO:\n \n Dr. Peter Raven, Secretary\n PRaven@nas.org\n Committee for Research and Exploration\n National Geographic Society\n Washington, DC 20036\n \n Dear Peter,\n \n I thought that I should address to you the concerns expressed below because your committee is at least partly involved and because you are certainly now the most prominent scientist at the National Geographic Society.\n \n With the publication of \"Feathers for T. rex?\" by Christopher P. Sloan in its November issue, National Geographic has reached an all-time low for engaging in sensationalistic, unsubstantiated, tabloid journalism. But at the same time the magazine may now claim to have taken its place in formal taxonomic literature.\n \n Although it is possible that Mr. Czerkas \"will later name\" the specimen identified on page 100 as Archaeoraptor liaoningensis, there is no longer any need for him to do so. \n \n Because this Latinized binomial has apparently not been published previously and has now appeared with a full-spread photograph of the specimen \"accompanied by a description or definition that states in words characters that are purported to differentiate the taxon,\" the name Archaeoraptor liaoningensis Sloan is now available for purposes of zoological nomenclature as of its appearance in National Geographic (International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, Article 13a, i). This is the worst nightmare of many zoologists---that their chance to name a new organism will be inadvertently scooped by some witless journalist. Clearly, National Geographic is not receiving competent consultation in certain scientific matters.\n \n Sloan's article explicitly states that the specimen in question is known to have been illegally exported and that \"the Czerkases now plan to return it to China.\" In Washington, in June of 1996, more than forty participants at the 4th International Meeting of the Society of Avian Paleontology and Evolution, held at the Smithsonian Institution, were signatories to a letter to the Director of the Chinese Academy of Sciences that deplored the illegal trade in fossils from China and encouraged the Chinese government to take further action to curb this exploitation.\n \n There were a few fossil dealers at that meeting and they certainly got the message. Thus, at least since mid-1996 it can hardly have been a secret to anyone in the scientific community or the commercial fossil business that fossils from Liaoning offered for sale outside of China are contraband.\n \n Most, if not all, major natural history museums in the United States have policies in effect that prohibit their staff from accepting any specimens that were not legally collected and exported from the country of origin. The National Geographic Society has not only supported research on such material, but has sensationalized, and is now exhibiting, an admittedly illicit specimen that would have been morally, administratively, and perhaps legally, off-limits to researchers in reputable scientific institutions.\n \n Prior to the publication of the article \"Dinosaurs Take Wing\" in the July 1998 National Geographic, Lou Mazzatenta, the photographer for Sloan's article, invited me to the National Geographic Society to review his photographs of Chinese fossils and to comment on the slant being given to the story. At that time, I tried to interject the fact that strongly supported alternative viewpoints existed to what National Geographic intended to present, but it eventually became clear to me that National Geographic was not interested in anything other than the prevailing dogma that birds evolved from dinosaurs.\n \n Sloan's article takes the prejudice to an entirely new level and consists in large part of unverifiable or undocumented information that \"makes\" the news rather than reporting it. His bald statement that \"we can now say that birds are theropods just as confidently as we say that humans are mammals\" is not even suggested as reflecting the views of a particular scientist or group of scientists, so that it figures as little more than editorial propagandizing. This melodramatic assertion had already been disproven by recent studies of embryology and comparative morphology, which, of course, are never mentioned.\n \n More importantly, however, none of the structures illustrated in Sloan's article that are claimed to be feathers have actually been proven to be feathers. Saying that they are is little more than wishful thinking that has been presented as fact. The statement on page 103 that \"hollow, hairlike structures characterize protofeathers\" is nonsense considering that protofeathers exist only as a theoretical construct, so that the internal structure of one is even more hypothetical.\n \n The hype about feathered dinosaurs in the exhibit currently on display at the National Geographic Society is even worse, and makes the spurious claim that there is strong evidence that a wide variety of carnivorous dinosaurs had feathers. A model of the undisputed dinosaur Deinonychus and illustrations of baby tyrannosaurs are shown clad in feathers, all of which is simply imaginary and has no place outside of science fiction.\n \n The idea of feathered dinosaurs and the theropod origin of birds is being actively promulgated by a cadre of zealous scientists acting in concert with certain editors at Nature and National Geographic who themselves have become outspoken and highly biased proselytizers of the faith. Truth and careful scientific weighing of evidence have been among the first casualties in their program, which is now fast becoming one of the grander scientific hoaxes of our age---the paleontological equivalent of cold fusion. If Sloan's article is not the crescendo of this fantasia, it is difficult to imagine to what heights it can next be taken. But it is certain that when the folly has run its course and has been fully exposed, National Geographic will unfortunately play a prominent but unenviable role in the book that summarizes the whole sorry episode.\n \n Sincerely,\n \n Storrs L. Olson\n Curator of Birds\n National Museum of Natural History\n Smithsonian Institution\n Washington, DC 20560\n \n Ph. 202-357-33212\n FAX 1-202-633-8084\n email: olson.storrs@nmnh.si.edu\n \n \n \n Out of date does not mean old. It means it has been replaced with a more current idea.\n\n The wrong answer will always be the wrong answer.\n Why don't you ask Dr. Olson if I made this up?

I don't have time to argue with someone who calls me a liar without any reason other that he is too lazy to read the bible of his religion.\n The only legitamite gripe I have found about creationist quotes was the eye ,about it being absurd in the highest degree to believe it arose by chance. Allthough that is true Darwin did use a colorful version of Victorian English and went on to explain how it could have happened.It is difficult to quote a whole paragraph but actually to an intelligent person the whole thing makes Darwin sound worse. \n As far as the transistionals you are dead wrong.\n Olson is the Curator of Birds for the Smithsonian Institute for Christ's sake.

   "I thought that conclusive evidence led to conclusive proof.\nNo. It has been explained to you many times and still you insist on being ignorant. Proof is a matter of math or booze. Conclusive evidence leads to a conclusion. There is always the possibility that there is some undiscovered bit of evidence that will not fit into the theory, which is an explanation of the evidence. In that case, the theory is altered to explain all of the evidence, including the new evidence.\n \nWhy is the jury still out on the THEORY of evolution?\n\n The jury isn't out. The hypothesis of evolution was elevated to a theory many years ago. In the early part of the 20th century the synthesis of evolutionary theory with genetics removed all rational doubt.\n \nWhy is it still called a theory?\nBecause it is still the only rational explanation for all of the evidence. Evolutionary theory has been verified time and time again. On the other hand, beginning about 200 years ago, the dogma of creation and the attached mythology was falsified and discarded by science.\n \nHow many more decades do scientists require to prove macro-evolution actually took place? Where is the proof? There is none, and never will be.\nActually, macro-evolution has been observed. There are lots of examples. I'll give you one. In the early part of the 19th century John Chapman (Johnny Appleseed) introduced apples into the Ohio valley. Chapman cleared land and planted apples all over the Northwest Territories. Since apples were imported from Europe, there were no natural pests. However, in about 1850, worms began to appear in the apples. These worms turned out to be the larvae of a small fly. This larvae and fly was found to be almost identical to the hawthorn maggotfly - thus it is called the apple maggotfly. But because the two kinds of plants set fruit at different times, the two flies have different breeding seasons. The do not seem to interbreed in the wild and do not interbreed in captivity. Later, a similar thing happened with cherries and pears - they have their own species of maggot fly, none of which interbreeds with any other type of maggot fly. This was a speciation event - in fact several. That is macro-evolution. It usually takes longer.",

Fish often fossilize. For example, fish fossils are often found in the limestone beds at Solnhofen (along with jellyfish, insects, crustaceans, crocodilians, and the most famous, the maniraptoran theropod Compsognathus and Archaeopteryx). And, of course, fossil fish are common in the Green River formation of Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming. They are so common that I saw one used as a wall decoration in the lobby of a motel. And that's just two places.\n \n And of course, none of the many, many examples of coelacanth looks very much like the two modern species. The two modern species are in a separate genus (and family for that matter) of their own and not in one of the genera (or families) of the fossil coelacanths. The modern coelacanth is larger then the known fossil varieties, and of course, is a deep water fish as opposed to the fact that all known fossil coelacanths were shallow water fish. \n \nExcept of course atheism needs evolution.\nThat makes no sense at all.

The nearly timeless species are not exempt from the changes of proteins that go on in all living beings, and they could surely vary in many ways without loss of adaptiveness, but their patterns have become somehow frozen. ... From the point of view of conventional evolutionary theory long-term stasis is hard to explain. Rapid evolution is comprehensive as species adapt to new conditions or opportunities but it is incongruous that species remain unchanged through changing conditions over many million years (Sheldon 1990, 114).\" (Wesson, Robert G. [political scientist], \"Beyond Natural Selection,\" [1991], MIT Press: Cambridge MA, 1994, reprint, pp.207-208). [top]\n \n \n \"The history of most fossil species includes two features particularly inconsistent with gradualism: 1. Stasis. Most species exhibit no directional change during their tenure on earth. They appear in the fossil record looking much the same as when they disappear; morphological change is usually limited and directionless. 2. Sudden appearance. In any local area, a species does not arise gradually by the steady transformation of its ancestors; it appears all at once and `fully formed.'\" (Gould, Stephen J. [Professor of Zoology and Geology, Harvard University, USA], \"Evolution's Erratic Pace,\" Natural History, Vol. 86, No. 5, May 1977, p.14). [top]\n \n \"For millions of years species remain unchanged in the fossil record,\" said Stephen Jay Gould, of Harvard, \"and they then abruptly disappear, to be replaced by something that is substantially different but clearly related.\" (Lewin, Roger [biochemist, former editor of New Scientist and science writer], \"Evolutionary- Theory Under Fire: An historic conference in Chicago challenges the four-decade long dominance of the Modern Synthesis,\" Science, Vol. 210, 21 November 1980, p.883). [top]\n At the core of punctuated equilibria lies an empirical observation: once evolved, species tend to remain remarkably stable, recognizable entities for millions of years. The observation is by no means new, nearly every paleontologist who reviewed Darwin's Origin of Species pointed to his evasion of this salient feature of the fossil record. But stasis was conveniently dropped as a feature of life's history to he reckoned with in evolutionary biology. And stasis had continued to be ignored until Gould and I showed that such stability is a real aspect of life's history which must be confronted-and that, in fact, it posed no fundamental threat to the basic notion of evolution itself. For that was Darwin's problem: to establish the plausibility of the very idea of evolution, Darwin felt that he had to undermine the older (and ultimately biblically based) doctrine of species fixity. Stasis, to Darwin, was an ugly inconvenience.\" (Eldredge, Niles [Chairman and Curator of Invertebrates, American Museum of Natural History], \"Time Frames: The Rethinking of Darwinian Evolution and the Theory of Punctuated Equilibria,\" Simon & Schuster: New York NY, 1985, pp.188-189). [top\n \n \"The principal problem is morphological stasis. A theory is only as good as its predictions, and conventional neo-Darwinism, which claims to be a comprehensive explanation of evolutionary process, has failed to predict the widespread long-term morphological stasis now recognized as one of the most striking aspects of the fossil record.\" (Williamson, Peter G.

Cats do not become dogs . The changes in living things that have been observed since the dawn of man have never included one such incident. It is pure imagination and makes as much sense as believing horses can fly. If you find a skeleton of a human in the dirt that is different from you it is still a human. When you find an animal with no known living relative it is a transistional and a common ancestor of some damn thing. This is circular reasoning. If there is no way to prove what it is so it must be a transistional because we  know they existed. How do we  know  this ?\n Speciation is the most childish argument an evolutionist can use. Darwin used it to explain the Galapagos Finches and cited it as proof of evolution. The fact than he was wrong and they can and do in fact interbreed is now even further proof of evolution. To not recognize this as proof of the completely unscientific nature of this issue is just plain stupid.\n Some animals may no longer be able to interbreed , so what. What does that have to do with fish becoming amphibians? \n Only a spiritually and morally bankrupt person could continue to believe this nonsense .

   "As per Peddler's suggestion, been there, done that. Here's the story I wrote at the time.\n \n It really isn't my place to define what biblical kinds are. I don't believe that the story of Noah and the flood is anything more that a myth written from the oral traditions of a nomadic desert people. What a kind is has no relevance to the real world. In fact, those desert nomads and modern fundamentalists are the only ones who care what a kind is. I suspect that those nomads are the only ones who have ever had more than a fuzzy idea of what it is anyway. \n \n At any rate, some time ago I was inspired to do some investigating to see if I could find out if kind might have some kind of clear, intuitive meaning. I surmised that the scientific sophistication of an intelligent 6 year old could not be too far beyond that of Noah. Thus, I grabbed several volumes of my old World Book (lots of great pictures that I know peddler would appreciate) and headed next door to visit my neighbors 6 year old daughter. \n \n I opened several of my books to pictures of various animals (I almost said \"kinds of animals\"). I asked the 6 year old to tell me how many kinds of animals there were. Her first reaction, and I feel an intuitive grasp of the meaning the word held for those ancient nomads, was to count all of the pictures. I insisted that some kinds of animals were pictured more than once. She carefully studied the pictures for a moment and then looked at me with a puzzled expression. As an example, I pointed out the pictures of a lion and a tiger. \n \n \"Nooooooo\", she responded. \n \n I explained that they were both cats. \n \n \"Noooooo! can't you see anything? That's a lion and that's a tiger. Those aren't the same kind of animal,\" she laughed. (This kind of thing is really hard on the ego, and I was being put down by a 6 year old.) \n \n No matter how I persisted, I could never get that 6 year old to admit that a lion and a tiger were the same kind of animal. I think I may have damaged my reputation for ever, since she now thinks that I'm not too bright. I was able to get one concession though. That 6 year old, after careful study, admitted that a jaguar and a leopard might be the same kind of animal. They don't have the same kind of spots though. Now a cheetah looks like the same kind of animal, but she didn't think it was. The ocelot and the ounce are definitely their own kind of animals. \n \n By the way. None of the animals pictured were the same kind as my tabby. (I think that this assertion did the most to damage my reputation. I hope the neighborhood 6 year olds don't talk about this sort of thing.) \n \n I guess the answer is that if you look at two animals and they look like they're the same kind, they're the same kind.

Yet you speak.\n \nHowever if we talk about species and speciation you are refering to animals that cannot interbreed,\n\n No I'm not. I was talking about many species of cat in several genera. Lions and tigers are generally considered to be separate species but they can interbreed and produce fertile offspring. A leopard can't interbreed with either a lion or a tiger, and the African wildcat or the carcal can't interbreed with any of them. Which are the \"kinds?\" It's a simple question since you claim that they exist. All I am asking is for you to explain how I can recognize a \"kind.\"\n \nWhen an example of different species that can interbreed like dogs , wolves and the Galopagos Finches then you simply change the definition of species and speciation to fit .\nWell, I wasn't aware that dogs and wolves were capable of interbreeding with \"Galopagos Finches,\" whatever those are. But actually, the definition of species and speciation has been pretty much the same for 100 years or so.\n \n I just happened to consider that you were making a reference to Darwin's finches in the Galapagos Islands. There are 14 generally recognized species of finch in 6 genra in the Galapagos Islands and Cocos Island. Of those, there are only two examples of interbreeding between separate species in very special circumstances. In each case DNA studies have shown that those species are closely related. A claim that \"Galopagos Finches\" interbreed is dishonest, since those species that do have very recently speciated.\n \nI am ok with that as it is a confusing subject and no one has all the answers and there is great disagreement on both sides.\nNo there isn't. Only creationists disagree. And it isn't all that confusing. Perhaps it is for you and other creationists, but that is because you seem to be too lazy to educate yourself in the basics of what you claim to oppose.\n \nI am tired of your semantics gynastics and you can change that or move on. it is up to you.\nWhat are \"gynastics?\" I think that you are trying to say that you can't answer any questions that have been asked and you want us to stop asking you to support your assertions. Not a chance.\n \nThis was my post and the subject is did IT DO IT .\nAnd the subject doesn't make sense.\n \nPlaying with semantics when your definitions of the same subject are subject to interpretation is not debating. It is being childish.\nSo when you are unable to support your assertions, define your terms, and answer questions, it is \"playing with semantics?\" Yet another implicit admission of defeat.

   "The ironic thing is that the two fossils that were glued togather to make the fake were as signifigent in their own right as the 'fake' fossil would have been.\nAlmost tragic. The front part was from a bird extinct and previously unknown bird, Yanornis martini. The tail was from what is now known to be the smallest dinosaur species ever found, a microraptor. Fortunately there is another spectacular specimen of a microraptor, Microraptor gui, a unique dinosaur with claws on the forelimbs, perching feet on the rear limbs, a long bony tail that terminates in a tuft of feathers, and flight feathers on all four limbs.\n \n It should be noted that Archaeoraptor (the forgery) was never described. The forgery was discovered during preliminary studies very early on in the process. One of the first paleontologists to study the fossil (was it Xu Xing?) recognized the tail because he had seen the counterslab associated with another fossil (Microraptor gui). It should also be noted that no \"creation scientist\" had any part in the discovery of the fraud. The reason is simple; \"creation scientists\" don't do science. It is important to realize that Archaeoraptor was never published and therefore never acknowledged by \"science.\" As I mentioned, the fraud was uncovered in the preliminary stages of examination, before the process of description had even begun. Later, Tim Rowe (author of The Mistaken Extinction: Dinosaur Evolution and the Origin of Birds with Lowell Dingus) an the University of Texas did the CT scans that conclusively proved the fossil to have been pieced together.\n \n It should also be noted that National Geographic is, contrary to what Peddler thinks, a sciene magazine, just as Natural History is a science magazine, and Scientific American is a science magazine. They publish articles and news about science. Science is presented to the scientific community for peer review when it is published in a scientific journal, like Science, Nature or the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. It is quite clear from Peddler's confused and pointless discussion that he believes National Geographic to be more than just a science magazine. I think that he believes that science is published in NG rather than articles about science.",

Thanks.\nOk professor , pay attention this time.\n \n \"\n National Museum of Natural History\n Smithsonian Institution\n Washington, D. C. 20560\n \n 1 November 1999\n \n OPEN LETTER TO:\n \n Dr. Peter Raven, Secretary\n PRaven@nas.org\n Committee for Research and Exploration\n National Geographic Society\n Washington, DC 20036\n \n Dear Peter,\n \n I thought that I should address to you the concerns expressed below because your committee is at least partly involved and because you are certainly now the most prominent scientist at the National Geographic Society.\n \n With the publication of \"Feathers for T. rex?\" by Christopher P. Sloan in its November issue, National Geographic has reached an all-time low for engaging in sensationalistic, unsubstantiated, tabloid journalism. But at the same time the magazine may now claim to have taken its place in formal taxonomic literature.\n \n Although it is possible that Mr. Czerkas \"will later name\" the specimen identified on page 100 as Archaeoraptor liaoningensis, there is no longer any need for him to do so. \n \n Because this Latinized binomial has apparently not been published previously and has now appeared with a full-spread photograph of the specimen \"accompanied by a description or definition that states in words characters that are purported to differentiate the taxon,\" the name Archaeoraptor liaoningensis Sloan is now available for purposes of zoological nomenclature as of its appearance in National Geographic (International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, Article 13a, i). This is the worst nightmare of many zoologists---that their chance to name a new organism will be inadvertently scooped by some witless journalist. Clearly, National Geographic is not receiving competent consultation in certain scientific matters.\n \n Sloan's article explicitly states that the specimen in question is known to have been illegally exported and that \"the Czerkases now plan to return it to China.\" In Washington, in June of 1996, more than forty participants at the 4th International Meeting of the Society of Avian Paleontology and Evolution, held at the Smithsonian Institution, were signatories to a letter to the Director of the Chinese Academy of Sciences that deplored the illegal trade in fossils from China and encouraged the Chinese government to take further action to curb this exploitation.\n \n There were a few fossil dealers at that meeting and they certainly got the message. Thus, at least since mid-1996 it can hardly have been a secret to anyone in the scientific community or the commercial fossil business that fossils from Liaoning offered for sale outside of China are contraband\n Most, if not all, major natural history museums in the United States have policies in effect that prohibit their staff from accepting any specimens that were not legally collected and exported from the country of origin. The National Geographic Society has not only supported research on such material, but has sensationalized, and is now exhibiting, an admittedly illicit specimen that would have been morally, administratively, and perhaps legally, off-limits to researchers in reputable scientific institutions\n \n \n Prior to the publication of the article \"Dinosaurs Take Wing\" in the July 1998 National Geographic, Lou Mazzatenta, the photographer for Sloan's article, invited me to the National Geographic Society to review his photographs of Chinese fossils and to comment on the slant being given to the story. At that time, I tried to interject the fact that strongly supported alternative viewpoints existed to what National Geographic intended to present, but it eventually became clear to me that National Geographic was not interested in anything other than the prevailing dogma that birds evolved from dinosaurs.\n \n Sloan's article takes the prejudice to an entirely new level and consists in large part of unverifiable or undocumented information that \"makes\" the news rather than reporting it. His bald statement that \"we can now say that birds are theropods just as confidently as we say that humans are mammals\" is not even suggested as reflecting the views of a particular scientist or group of scientists, so that it figures as little more than editorial propagandizing. This melodramatic assertion had already been disproven by recent studies of embryology and comparative morphology, which, of course, are never mentioned.\n \n More importantly, however, none of the structures illustrated in Sloan's article that are claimed to be feathers have actually been proven to be feathers. Saying that they are is little more than wishful thinking that has been presented as fact. The statement on page 103 that \"hollow, hairlike structures characterize protofeathers\" is nonsense considering that protofeathers exist only as a theoretical construct, so that the internal structure of one is even more hypothetical.\n \n The hype about feathered dinosaurs in the exhibit currently on display at the National Geographic Society is even worse, and makes the spurious claim that there is strong evidence that a wide variety of carnivorous dinosaurs had feathers. A model of the undisputed dinosaur Deinonychus and illustrations of baby tyrannosaurs are shown clad in feathers, all of which is simply imaginary and has no place outside of science fiction.\n \n The idea of feathered dinosaurs and the theropod origin of birds is being actively promulgated by a cadre of zealous scientists acting in concert with certain editors at Nature and National Geographic who themselves have become outspoken and highly biased proselytizers of the faith. Truth and careful scientific weighing of evidence have been among the first casualties in their program, which is now fast becoming one of the grander scientific hoaxes of our age---the paleontological equivalent of cold fusion. If Sloan's article is not the crescendo of this fantasia, it is difficult to imagine to what heights it can next be taken. But it is certain that when the folly has run its course and has been fully exposed, National Geographic will unfortunately play a prominent but unenviable role in the book that summarizes the whole sorry episode.\n \n Sincerely,\n \n Storrs L. Olson\n Curator of Birds\n National Museum of Natural History\n Smithsonian Institution\n Washington, DC 20560..\n \n NOTE: National Geographic, apparently still more arrogant than scientific, devoted less than four column-inches to confessing that 'Archaeoraptor' was a composite of a dinosaur's tail and a bird's body (March 2000), compared to the ten-page spread originally devoted to misinforming its readership (November 1999\n \n \n\n That\\'ll be why the Archaeoraptor fraud, and the Piltdown man fraud and all the other fossil frauds were all - every last one of them - exposed by \"evolutionist\" i guess emoticon_rolleyes\n Read it again. Over 200 Doctoral were awarded on the Piltdown Manas the subject of the thesis. It took a very long time to expose,40+ years. As early as 1914 scientist were calling it a hoax.

Or the favorite we have no proof because it happened long ago and far away.\n\n \n There also isn't a single peer reviewed piece of evidence proving a link between me and my ancestors.

John Rice Cole notes that in the 20s there were about 2 dissertations per year in physical anthropology in the entire US on ANY topic. \n Robert Parson made a systematic search of the bibliographies of The Piltdown Forgery by Weiner, The Piltdown Inquest by Blinderman, Piltdown: A Scientific Forgery and The Piltdown Papers by Spencer, The Antiquity of Man (1925) and New Discoveries Relating to the Antiquity of Man (1931) by Sir Arthur Keith.

I think Olsan would qualify.Read his letter! I had a long argument with one of the brains at talk/origins and even he said the Geographic was a sensationalist magazine.

They cited evidence evolution discarded decades ago.\n They are a joke.Most, if not all, major natural history museums in the United States have policies in effect that prohibit their staff from accepting any specimens that were not legally collected and exported from the country of origin. The National Geographic Society has not only supported research on such material, but has sensationalized, and is now exhibiting, an admittedly illicit specimen that would have been morally, administratively, and perhaps legally, off-limits to researchers in reputable scientific institutions. \n \n Prior to the publication of the article \"Dinosaurs Take Wing\" in the July 1998 National Geographic, Lou Mazzatenta, the photographer for Sloan's article, invited me to the National Geographic Society to review his photographs of Chinese fossils and to comment on the slant being given to the story.

Are you admitting that you are unaware that there are fossil flea markets that deal in illegal fossils? You actually weren't aware that this fossil was purchased in such a flea market in the U.S.? Why is it that you seem to argue from ignorance so much? The information is available and takes only a little effort to find.\n \nI am tiring of talking to you. I think Olsan would qualify.Read his letter!\n\n I have read the letter, at least enough to know that the man spells his name, \"Olson.\" Once more I'll explain to you that his position is that birds evolved directly from archosaurs rather than evolving from the intermediate dinosaurs.\n \nI had a long argument with one of the brains at talk/origins and even he said the Geographic was a sensationalist magazine. Read their November 2004 article-was Darwin wrong. They cited evidence evolution discarded decades ago.\nNonsense. You didn't read the article, did you? The answer given in NG was no, he wasn't wrong.\n \nThey are a joke.Most, if not all, major natural history museums in the United States have policies in effect that prohibit their staff from accepting any specimens that were not legally collected and exported from the country of origin.\nOK. Sounds good to me.\n \nThe National Geographic Society has not only supported research on such material, but has sensationalized, and is now exhibiting, an admittedly illicit specimen that would have been morally, administratively, and perhaps legally, off-limits to researchers in reputable scientific institutions.\nThe National Geographic Society isn't exhibiting any illegal specimens. What are you talking about? They screwed up, the admitted that they screwed up, and hopefully they are out of the fossil business. Please support your assertion with facts.\n \nPrior to the publication of the article \"Dinosaurs Take Wing\" in the July 1998 National Geographic, Lou Mazzatenta, the photographer for Sloan's article, invited me to the National Geographic Society to review his photographs of Chinese fossils and to comment on the slant being given to the story. At that time, I tried to interject the fact that strongly supported alternative viewpoints existed to what National Geographic intended to present, but it eventually became clear to me that National Geographic was not interested in anything other than the prevailing dogma that birds evolved from dinosaurs.\nThey invited you? I fail to see the point in inviting a scientific illiterate to examine any fossil.\n \nYes you are . You keep calling me a liar but you don't even read the letter Olsan wrote.\nThat's \"Olson.\" Apparently you didn't read the letter either.\n \n\"Paleontologists have tried to turn Archaeopteryx into an earth-bound, feathered dinosaur.

Morell, Science 259(5096):764-65, 5 February 1993\nI've already explained this to you. Feduccia claims that birds evolved directly from archosaurs, thus it is important to him that Archaeopteryx NOT be a maniraptorian dinosaur. It has to be a bird.\n [QUOTE=peddler8111Feduccia has this to say regarding the thesis of reptile-bird evolution:\n \n \"Well, I've studied bird skulls for 25 years and I don't see any similarities whatsoever. I just don't see it... The theropod origins of birds, in my opinion, will be the greatest embarrassment of paleontology of the 20th century. \"[/quote]\n Except that more and more evidence since that quote has supported the theropod origins of birds.\n \nLarry Martin, a specialist in ancient birds from the University of Kansas, also opposes the theory that birds are descended from dinosaurs. Discussing the contradiction that evolution falls into on the subject, he states:\n \n To tell you the truth, if I had to support the dinosaur origin of birds with those characters, I'd be embarrassed every time I had to get up and talk about it.\nSo what? The view that you are pushing is that birds evolved from a common ancestor with dinosaurs, some unknown archosaur.\n \nThe disagreement amongst evolutionists themselves stems from the fact that there is no evidence supporting an evolutionary origin for birds. They can only build up speculations, just-so stories which are imposed on the public, misleadingly, as \"scientific theories\".\n\n No. Everyone you quoted supports an evolutionary origin of birds based on evidence. Wouldn't it be better to learn what you were talking about before you spoke?\n \nTruth is subjective? So when you lie it is okay and if I disagree or present evidence that conflicts your views I am a liar.\n\n Now what are you talking about. You have been caught in lies several times. Since this has all been explained to you before, you are lying here.\n \nYou have no honor , none whatsoever I can see.\nThere you go again.\n \nScience says dino to bird evolution is impossible .\nReally? Where does science say that?\n \nLook at the avian lung. The belief that it happened has zero support by science. it is purely a stupid . atheistic religious belief.\nBeen there, done that.

   "Please be serious. Are you trying to say they saw an add in the local tradrer-Dino-Bird Fossil best offer? You are naive or worse if you believe they were not involved in the smuggling.\nI am being serious. I actually make the effort to check these things. The faked fossil was smuggled out of China and sold at a gem and mineral show in Tuscan to Stephen A. Czerkas, the director of a small museum in Utah. He notified a Canadian scientist friend of his, Philip J. Currie. It was Currie who contacted National Geographic as he occasionally writes for them. Nation Geographic then convinced Czerkas to let them publish the paper on the find and to then return it to China (so that the Chinese authorities would not accuse National Geographic from smuggling and thus damaging the relationship between the magazine and China). It made little difference in the end when the whole sorry affair exploded in National Geographic's face.\n \n \nI am tiring of talking to you.\nThen stop doing so.\n \n \nI think Olsan would qualify.Read his letter!

Others currently disagree with this position.\n One can say anything. I can say that the face on the moons is evidence that the moon is actually god. One must have a logical reason for their interpretation. There is no way to come up with a logical reason to interpret marks on some fossils being the imaginary proto-feathers while the same marks on other rocks are ignored.

No one knows what a proto-feather would look like much less the internal structure. It is pure imagination not science.\n You ignore the fact that the avian lung could not have evolved from any other lung. It had to be created that way. Or maybe birds evolved from a different rock, chemical soup or whatever nonsense completely independant of every thing else on earth.\n Some flying reptiles found in the fossil record give evidence of having had a fur-like covering, rather than scales. Yet evolutionists do not thereby feel compelled to admit that they evolved into mammals-mainly because this does not fit other parts of their evolutionary story.\n Feduccia and others have studied the facts, rather than the enthusiastic interpretations. \n Long ago and far far away.\n \n \n\n Oops, you are slipping into lies again.

It's whether a dinosaur or a non-dinosaur reptile that is the common ancestor that is still under debate.\n\n Now that is a perfect example of an outright lie or the babblings of an idiot.\n You tell me?\n We have gone round and round about examples of leading scientist who dismiss dino-bird evolution out of hand.
