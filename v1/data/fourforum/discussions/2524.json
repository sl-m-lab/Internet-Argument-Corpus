   "The recent Harry Potter movie is breaking box-office records, and is notably more popular than The Passion of the Christ, despite all the controversy and church efforts to get people to go see the latter. Over the past few days since release, The Prisoner of Azkaban has sold US$114.8 million worth of tickets in its opening weekend, just under \"Spiderman\"'s record, and much higher than the graphic movie about \"Jesus' last day\"($76.2 million). Apparently a children's film about wizards and Hippogriffs is more interesting to most people than a gory flick about the \"torture and martyrdom\" of a supposed God. Go figure. \n \n Interestingly, fundamentalist Christians see the popularity of the Potter series as the preparation and indoctrination of children for the \"coming Anti-Christ\". They cite the author's use of mythological and pagan symbolism along with similarities with Jesus' story as further evidence of the author's \"Satanism\". It seems to go right over their heads that Jesus' story is just a rewrite of much earlier pagan Sun God/Saviour King myths, shared by mythological figures from Egypt (King Amenhotep and the God Horus), Greece (Dionysius), Persia (Mithra) Asia and South Asia (Buddha and Krishna) all much older than myth about Jesus or Satan. Nobody has yet dared to recommend that churches adopt a teenage heart-throb as figurehead in order to increase membership.",

   "What kind of a debate does this have to do with?\n Shouldn't this be in the open forum section?\n\n I couldn't decide between Entertainment and Religion. It has to do with both. \n \n \nWe are talking about the popularity of films here. Harry Potter isn't a real person.\n\n Jesus isn't a real person either. Harry Potter and Jesus are both literary figures, but apparently people are more interested in cute Harry than bloody Jesus. Go figure.\n \n Also, the Harry Potter foloowers put just as much time, money and study into the books as any religion. They refer to the books in biblical-type shorthand (ex. OoP 12:163 is Order of the Pheonix, Chapter 12, pg 163), they refer to the timeline either according to the years of the books (1-7), or to the year of Harry's birth as year 0. They dress in costumes, write fictional stories/fantasies about the characters, and spend hours analysing the stories.\n \n I think it is very interesting that people believe that Harry Potter books are \"Satanic\", etc., given the good they obviously do. For example, no one that I've heard of has ever killed anyone in the name of Harry Potter, plus it has gotten so many people (esp. kids) reading. The stories have brought joy to the world. \n \n However, it is true that the story of Harry is similar to the story of Jesus- both share many elements of the classic ancient Saviour/God/King stories. Along with many other examples, from Buddha and Shiva to Moses and Jesus, to King Arthur. Both were \"prophesied\" as a Savior (though in Jesus' case this is spurious, Harry's prophesy is much clearer), are \"attacked\" as infants but escape through magical protection, and exist to save the world from evil. The Harry Potter stories contain literally dozens of references to this archetype, for example serpents and a phoenix, along with names such as his mother's 'Lily' (lilies have long been associated with mothers of saviour-kings, as they were with the Virgin Mary). These links between older pagan stories and the story of Jesus are naturally threatening to people who want to keep hidden the ample historical evidence that the Jesus story is only one of many such myths. Just as they burned ancient pagan libraries, they want to burn the Harry Potter books.",

   "Start by reading Josephus to realise your massive mistake.\n\n \n How many times do we have to go over the same things. Josephus's 'Testimonium Flavianum' was an obvious forgery. Have you actually read the statement yourself? Despite your \"faith\", I believe you are still far too intelligent a person to claim the piece as valid if you know the details yourself.\n \n I've gone over this in several forums, so here we go again-\n \n \nNow, there was about this time, Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful to call him a man, for he was a doer of wonderful works,a teacher of such men as receive the truth with pleasure. He drew over to him both many of the Jews, and many of the Gentiles. He was the Christ; and when Pilate, at the suggestion of the principal men amongst us, had condemned him to the cross, those that loved him at the first did not forsake him, for he appeared to them alive again the third day, as the divine prophets had foretold these and ten thousand other wonderful things concerning him; and the tribe of Christians, so named from him, are not extinct at this day.\n\n - Josephus (aka Joseph ben Matthias) The Antiquities of the Jews, Book 18, Chapter 3: the so called Testimonium Flavianum \n \n 1. Not a single writer before the 4th century - not Justin, Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian, Cyprian, Arnobius, etc. - in all their defences against pagan hostility, makes a single reference to Josephus' wondrous words.\n \n The third century Church 'Father' Origen, for example, spent half his life and a quarter of a million words contending against the pagan writer Celsus. Origen drew on all sorts of proofs and witnesses to his arguments in his fierce defence of Christianity. He quotes from Josephus extensively. Yet even he makes no reference to this 'golden paragraph' from Josephus, which would have been the ultimate rebuttal. In fact, Origen actually said that Josephus was \"not believing in Jesus as the Christ.\"\n \n It was absent from early copies of the works of Josephus and did not appear in Origen's third century version of Josephus, referenced in his Contra Celsum.\n \n Origen did not quote the 'golden paragraph' because this paragraph had not yet been written.\n \n 2. How could Josephus claim that Jesus had been the answer to his messianic hopes yet remain an orthodox Jew?\n \n 3. If Josephus really thought Jesus had been 'the Christ' surely he would have added more about him than one paragraph, a casual aside in someone else's (Pilate's) story? \n \n In fact, Josephus relates much more about John the Baptist than about Jesus! He also reports in great detail the antics of other self-proclaimed messiahs, including Judas of Galilee, Theudas the Magician, and the unnamed 'Egyptian Jew' messiah.\n \n It is striking that though Josephus confirms everything the Christians could wish for, he adds nothing not in the gospel narratives, nothing that would have been unknown by Christians already. \n \n 4. The passage is out of context. Book 18 starts with the Roman taxation under Cyrenius in 6 AD, talks about various Jewish sects at the time, including the Essenes, and a sect of Judas the Galilean. He discusses Herod's building of various cities, the succession of priests and procurators, and so on.\n \n Chapter 3 starts with a sedition against Pilate who planned to slaughter all the Jews but changed his mind. Pilate then used sacred money to supply water to Jerusalem, and the Jews protested. Pilate sent spies among the Jews with concealed weapons, and there was a great massacre.\n \n Then comes the paragraph about Jesus, and immediately after it, Josephus continues:\n \n 'And about the same time another terrible misfortune confounded the Jews . . .'\n \n Josephus, an orthodox Jew, would not have thought the Christian story to be 'another terrible misfortune.' It is only a Christian who would have considered this to be a Jewish tragedy.\n \n Paragraph 3 can be lifted out of the text with no damage to the chapter. It flows better without it. Outside of this tiny paragraph, in all of Josephus's voluminous works, there is not a single reference to Christianity anywhere.\n \n 5. The hyperbolic language is uncharacteristic of the historian:\n \n '. . . as the divine prophets had foretold these and ten thousand other wonderful things concerning him . . .'\n \n This is not at all Josephus' writing style. It does however fit perfectly with the style of early Christian propagandists, such as Eusebius- the self-proclaimed \"liar for God\" and forger.\n \n \nI conclude, using her method that history is more popular than 'family values, because the film \"Troy\" grossed more than \"Raising Helen\"\n\n \"Troy\" is not a completely historical film, it is a mythological one based on oral history which is only partially supported archeologically, thus still more historical than \"The Passion\".\n \n At any rate, I specifically brought up \"Harry Potter\" because I find the claims that the series is \"Satanic\" interesting. Some of the links made by fundamentalists on the symbols used in the series are partially correct. Their only mistake, really, is stating that because such symbols have important ritual and mythological meaning that they must be \"evil\". This opinion tends to demonstrate a lack of understanding of the roots of Christian mythology, which are almost entirely pagan.",

Despite your \"faith\", I believe you are still far too intelligent a person to claim the piece as valid if you know the details yourself.\n\n \n It is suggested that Josephus' mentions of Jesus is a forgery, it is not a foregone conclusion as you would wish. Even one that site that does accept the 're-working' of the text, and that the Arabic text is the original says this...\n \"The only clear non-Christian Jewish reference in this period is that of Josephus Antiquities XVIII.63-64, the so-called Testimonium Flavianum. Virtually all scholars are agreed that the received text is a Christian rewriting, but most are prepared to accept that in the original text a brief account of Jesus, perhaps in a less complimentary vein, stood at this point /2/. Josephus' passing mention of 'Jesus, the so-called Messiah' in Antiquities XX.200 is hard to explain without some previous notice of this Jesus, especially since Josephus elsewhere makes no reference to Christianity, nor even uses the term Christos of any other figure. The different and less 'committed' version of the Testimonium preserved in a tenth-century Arabic quotation from Josephus/3/, while it is unlikely to represent the original text, does testify to the existence of an account of Jesus in Josephus' work underlying the Christianized text. But reconstruction of what Josephus wrote is necessarily speculative.\"\n http://www.leaderu.com/truth/1truth21.html\n \n So, you accept the Arabic version as authoritative (because the other version is a fake), and it mentions Christ! Unless you are now to proposition that it too is fake!\n \n That is to say, even in the Arabic text, Jesus is mentioned.\n Immediately after this period, we have accounts from Tacitus\n \"Consequently, to get rid of the report, Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberious at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome, where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their centre and become popular. Accordingly, an arrest was first made of all who pleaded guilty; then upon their information, an immense multitude was convicted, not so much of the crime of firing the city, as of hatred against mankind. Mockery of every sort was added to their deaths, Covered with the skins of beasts, they were torn by dogs and perished, or were nailed to crosses, or were doomed to the flames and burnt, to serve as a nightly illumination, when daylight had expired. Nero offered his gardens for the spectacle, and was exhibiting a show in the circus, while he mingled with the people in the dress of charioteer or stood aloft on a car. Hence, even for criminals who deserved extreme and exemplary punishment, there arose a feeling of compassion; for it was not, as it seemed, for the public good, but to glut one man's cruelty, that they were being destroyed.\"\n http://www.sonic.net/sentinel/naij3.html\n \n And then, talk about selective usage of the materials. You conclude that because early Christians (who believed in Christ) didn't use Josephus (which mentions Christ), that Christ Himself, never existed!\n \n This illogic is simply undone by the fact your same 'witnesses' believed in the Gospel as historically true. Thus you are accepting them (as authoritative) when it suits you, and not, when it does not.\n \n Secondly, Troy had historical context, so I am happy with the analogy that you are basing your notion of popularity (in absolute terms) simply by box-office sales of films.\n \n It might in fact suggest that Christians (who must be making up part of the audience) aren't the sticks-in-the-mud that you would suppose.\n \n And while we're on about discussing the Greeks, it is known that there is in fact less 'textual' support for Alexander the Great than there is for Jesus Christ.\n \n Some people are so unashamedly rabidly anti-Christian that they will take even box-office takings as an indication that Christ isn't liked.",

   "Post 4\n \nJesus isn't a real person either. Harry Potter and Jesus are both literary figures, but apparently people are more interested in cute Harry than bloody Jesus. Go figure.\n\n \n Sorry for the long quote...\n \n \"The words in ALL CAPS are likely interpolations added by Christian copyists over the centuries in an attempt to make Josephus support faith in Jesus as the Christ.....\n \n Now there was about this time Jesus, a wise man IF IT BE LAWFUL TO CALL HIM A MAN, for he was a doer of wonders, A TEACHER OF SUCH MEN AS RECEIVE THE TRUTH WITH PLEASURE.

When Pilate, at the suggestion of the principal men among us, had condemned him to the cross, those that loved him at the first did not forsake him, FOR HE APPEARED TO THEM ALIVE AGAIN THE THIRD DAY, AS THE DIVINE PROPHETS HAD FORETOLD THESE AND THEN THOUSAND OTHER WONDERFUL THINGS ABOUT HIM, and the tribe of Christians, so named from him, are not extinct at this day (Antiquities 18:63-64).\n \n Professor Shlomo Pines found a different version of Josephus testimony in an Arabic version of the tenth century. It has obviously not been interpolated in the same way as the Christian version circulating in the West: \n \n At this time there was a wise man who was called Jesus, and his conduct was good, and he was known to be virtuous. And many people from among the Jews and the other nations became his disciples. Pilate condemned him to be crucified and to die. And those who had become his disciples did not abandon their loyalty to him. They reported that he had appeared to them three days after his crucifixion, and that he was alive. Accordingly they believed that he was the Messiah, concerning whom the Prophets have recounted wonders.\n http://www.religiousstudies.uncc.edu/jdtabor/josephus-jesus.html\n \n That is, regardless of which version, Jesus is still mentioned! Even those that don't believe Josephus' account is 'pristine' still have versions mentioning Jesus!\n \n Further to that, one of the passages believe to have been modified by Christians reads\n Antiquities 20.9.1 But the younger Ananus who, as we said, received the high priesthood, was of a bold disposition and exceptionally daring; he followed the party of the Sadducees, who are severe in judgment above all the Jews, as we have already shown. As therefore Ananus was of such a disposition, he thought he had now a good opportunity, as Festus was now dead, and Albinus was still on the road; so he assembled a council of judges, and brought before it the brother of Jesus the so-called Christ, whose name was James, together with some others, and having accused them as law-breakers, he delivered them over to be stoned.\n quoted at http://www.tektonics.org/tekton_01_01_01_JOS.html\n \n So that cunning Christian forger that Mizmaxx has faith in has Josephus deny the Christ-hood of Jesus by saying 'the so-called Christ'.\n \n Ironically as it turns out Mizmaxx is so anti-Christian in her thought that she would believe that a forger exists, to which there is even less evidence of then for the historical Jesus!\n \n In fact, her un-soruced claim states...\n \n \n. Not a single writer before the 4th century ? not Justin, Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian, Cyprian, Arnobius, etc. ? in all their defences against pagan hostility, makes a single reference to Josephus? wondrous words.\n \n The third century Church 'Father' Origen, for example, spent half his life and a quarter of a million words contending against the pagan writer Celsus.

THE BRETHREN OF JESUS.\n \"But other of the Apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother.\" And to so great a reputation among the people for righteousness did this James rise, that Flavius Josephus, who wrote the \"Antiquities of the Jews\" in twenty books, when wishing to exhibit the cause why the people suffered so great misfortunes that even the temple was razed to the ground, said, that these things happened to them in accordance with the wrath of God in consequence of the things which they had dared to do against James the brother of Jesus who is called Christ.\n http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/origen-matthew.html\n \n Note the contention that no single writer, not one, before the 4th century makes a reference to Josephus' words.

Obviously Origen had no problem with Josephus.\n \n \nYet even he makes no reference to this 'golden paragraph' from Josephus, which would have been the ultimate rebuttal. In fact, Origen actually said that Josephus was \"not believing in Jesus as the Christ.\"\n\n \n Note well Mizmaxx, this source of yours isn't here arguing that Jesus does not exist, but that Josephus didn't call Jesus 'Christ'.

   "So, you accept the Arabic version as authoritative (because the other version is a fake), and it mentions Christ! Unless you are now to proposition that it too is fake!\n\n Do you have any idea how many people called themselves the Christ/Messiah at the time, and how many people were named Jesus? That's like saying that because you can find mention of someone named \"Claus\" in medieval Germany proves that Santa Claus was a real person. \n \n If you can find something which mentions a Jesus of Nazareth, born of a carpenter and a \"virgin\", or even just in any way slightly resembling the Gospel accounts- not just any random person calling themself the Messiah and/or Jesus Christ, than there is no sound evidence of the existence of a historical Christ. This shouldn't disturb people who base their belief in the Gospels on faith, only those who expected there to be sound factual historic evidence of a historic figure as described in the Gospels.\n \n \nImmediately after this period, we have accounts from Tacitus\n\n \n \n Would (could) Nero have made such a fine sectarian distinction - particularly since there was no identifying faith document (not a single gospel had been written) - so just what would 'Christians' have believed? Even St Paul himself makes not a single reference to 'Christians' in any of his writings.\n \n The idea that a nascent 'Christianity' immediately faced persecution from a cruel and bloodthirsty pagan Rome is an utter nonsense. For one thing, it is only in the last third of the 1st century C.E., that Christ-followers emerged as a separate faction from mainstream Judaism. Until then they remained protected under Roman law as Jews. The irritation they caused to their more orthodox brethren meant nothing to the pagan magistrates. Says Gibbon:\n \n 'The innocence of the first Christians was protected by ignorance and contempt; and the tribunal of the Pagan magistrate often proved the most assured refuge against the fury of the synagogue.'\n \n \n Early christ-followers called themselves 'saints', 'brethren', 'Brothers of the Lord' and their critics used various names: Nazoreans, Ebionites, 'god fearers', atheists. The Jewish association remained strong throughout the first century and when Christian sects got going in Rome in the second century they were identified by their rival leaders - Valentinians, Basilidians, Marcionites, etc.\n \n So little were christ-worshippers known in the Roman world that as late as the 90s Dio Cassio refers to 'atheists' and 'those adopting Jewish manners'. Christians as a distinct group from the Jews appear only late in the 1st century, not long before the Jewish curse on heretics at the council of Jamnia (around 85 C.E.). The label 'Christian' itself only appears with the 2nd century Acts - with the story that the term 'began in Antioch' (11.26).\n\n \n The term 'Christian' was not in use during the reign of Nero and there would not have been 'a great crowd' unless we are speaking of Jews, not Christians. 'Jewish/Christians' - being perceived by Roman authorities (and the populace at large) simply as Jews meant that early Christ-followers also got caught up in general attacks upon the Jews.\n \n No Christian apologist for centuries ever quoted the passage of Tacitus - not in fact, until it had appeared almost word-for-word in the writings of Sulpicius Severus, in the early fifth century, where it is mixed in with other myths. Sulpicius's contemporaries credited him with a skill in the 'antique' hand. He put it to good use and fantasy was his forte: his Life of St. Martin is replete with numerous 'miracles', including raising of the dead and personal appearances by Jesus and Satan.\n \n His dastardly story of Nero was embellished during the renaissance into a fantastic fable with Nero 'fiddling while Rome burned'. Nero took advantage of the destruction to build his 'Golden House', though no serious scholar believes anymore that he started the fire (we now know Nero was in his hometown of Antium - Anzio - when the blaze started.) Indeed, Nero opened his palace garden for temporary shelter to those made homeless.\n \n In short, the passage in Tacitus is a fraud and adds no evidence for a historic Jesus. \n \n \nAnd while we're on about discussing the Greeks, it is known that there is in fact less 'textual' support for Alexander the Great than there is for Jesus Christ.\n\n How can there be \"less\"? There is no textual support for a historical Christ, aside from some desperate forgeries.\n \n \nIronically as it turns out Mizmaxx is so anti-Christian in her thought that she would believe that a forger exists, to which there is even less evidence of then for the historical Jesus!\n\n LOL! Anti-christian- does that mean I'm against Christianity (which I'm not), or that I'm for the Anti-Christ (which I'm neither)? Unless of course you are among those who believe that HP is the anti-Christ, which I guess would make me hugely anti-christian... lol\n \n As for whether a \"forger\" exists, the following-\n \n 'There is nothing so easy as by sheer volubility to deceive a common crowd or an uneducated congregation.'\n (St. Jerome, Epistle. lii, 8; p. 93.)\n \n 'For if the truth of God hath more abounded by my lie unto his glory, why yet am I also adjudged a sinner?' (St. Paul, Romans 3.7)\n \n Jerome is not alone in his candour. Bishop Eusebius, the official propagandist for Constantine, entitles the 32nd Chapter of his 12th Book of Evangelical Preparation:\n \n How it may be Lawful and Fitting to use Falsehood as a Medicine, and for the Benefit of those who Want to be Deceived.\n \n Eusebius is notoriously the author of a great many falsehoods - but then he does warn us in his infamous history:\n \n 'We shall introduce into this history in general only those events which may be useful first to ourselves and afterwards to posterity.'\n (Ecclesiastical History, Vol. 8, chapter 2).\n \n John Chrysostom, fifth century theologian and erstwhile bishop of Constantinople, is another:\n \n 'Great is the force of deceit! provided it is not excited by a treacherous intention.'\n (Commentary on I Cor. ix, 19; Diegesis, p. 309.)\n \n The question is not 'did early christians lie, forge, etc.?', because they were very candid about the fact that they did. \n \n Notable Christian forgeries include:\n \n The Donation of Constantine \n 'Without doubt a forgery...' Catholic Encyclopedia\n A two-part document purporting to be from the first Christian emperor to Pope Sylvester I (314-35). In the 'Confessio' Constantine thanks Sylvester for his Christian instruction and baptism (and consequent cure of leprosy!) In his 'Donatio' Constantine confers on the pope and his successors primacy over all other bishops, including the eastern patriarchs, senatorial privileges for the clergy, imperial palaces and regalia, Rome itself and the western empire!!\n \n In truth, this monstrous eighth century forgery (peppered with anachronisms) was almost certainly written by the future Pope Paul I ( 757-67) while his equally ambitious brother Stephen II (752-57) sat on the papal throne. \n \n The False Decretals\n A riot of more than a hundred fake letters and decrees attributed to pontiffs from first century Clement (88-97) to seventh century Gregory I (590-604). Now attributed to 'Isodore Mercator', a ninth century master forger, almost certainly a papal aide. Like the Donation, the Decretals conferred rights and privileges on the papacy.\n \n 'Thundering Legion' Decree of Marcus Aurelius\n In this fabricated letter from the emperor to the Senate, Marcus is said to have forbidden persecution of Christians because, in a battle with the Quadi in 174, prayers from Christian soldiers brought on a thunderstorm which rescued the Romans from thirst and dispersed the barbarian opponents. The emperor is said to have accorded the Twelfth Legion the suffix fulminata or fulminea, that is, 'thundering.' Tertullian (c.160 - c.230), north African theologian, made up this nonsense; the twelfth legion had had the suffix legio fulminata from the time of Augustus. The stoic Marcus Aurelius had nothing but contempt for the Christians.\n \n 'Letters' of Emperor Antoninus Pius to the Greeks\n More fakery, this time from the pen of forth century Bishop Eusebius (Ecclesiastic History, IV, 13). \n \n The Clementines\n These fancies, twenty books of 'curious religious romance' (Catholic Encyclopedia), masquerade as the work of first century pontiff Clement I. Written in the fourth century, their purpose was to bolster Rome's claim to be the primary see: here we have the 'Epistle of Clement to James' which originated the notion that St. Peter was the first Bishop of Rome.\n \n and so on...\n Correspondence between Seneca and Paul\n \n Chapter 16 of Life of Nero by Suetonius (This is the origin of the 'Christians burnt as torches' nonsense.)\n \n The Lentulus Letter \n \n Report of Pilate to Caesar (Pilate's conversion to Christianity!) \n \n Letter of Jesus to the King of Edessa\n \n etc.\n \n \nThat is, regardless of which version, Jesus is still mentioned! Even those that don't believe Josephus' account is 'pristine' still have versions mentioning Jesus!\n\n Josephus, the first century Jewish historian mentions no fewer than nineteen different Yeshuas/Jesii, about half of them contemporaries of the supposed Christ. In his Antiquities, of the twenty-eight high priests who held office from the reign of Herod the Great to the fall of the Temple, no fewer than four bore the name Jesus.\n \n Mentioning that someone named Jesus existed at that time and place is no great feat, neither is it evidence of a singular historical Christ. I don't doubt that there were many people going around calling themselves Christ, according to accounts you couldn't spit in Galilee without hitting a \"Messiah\". Even Saint Paul makes reference to a rival magician, preaching 'another Jesus' (2 Corinthians 11,4). There were numerous cults at the time, and in fact the Essene sect called all their high priests \"Christ\". The word just means \"anointed one\", and apparently there was a whole lot of anointing going on. \n \n The question is, do you have any evidence that a singular person existed whose life was chronicled, even if it was warped and hyperbolized, into the Gospels? I have yet to see any such evidence. \n \n \nOrigen\n COMMENTARY ON MATTHEW\n FROM THE FIRST BOOK OF THE COMMENTARY ON MATTHEW\n 17. THE BRETHREN OF JESUS.\n \"But other of the Apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother.\" And to so great a reputation among the people for righteousness did this James rise, that Flavius Josephus, who wrote the \"Antiquities of the Jews\" in twenty books, when wishing to exhibit the cause why the people suffered so great misfortunes that even the temple was razed to the ground, said, that these things happened to them in accordance with the wrath of God in consequence of the things which they had dared to do against James the brother of Jesus who is called Christ.\n\n This is not in reference to the Testimonium, the \"wondrous words\" I was speaking of. It refers to a later passage by Josephus:\n \nFestus was now dead, and Albinus was put upon the road; so he assembled the sanhedrin of judges, and brought before them the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James, and some others, (or some of his companions). And when he had formed an accusation against them as breakers of the law, he delivered them to be stoned.\n\n Josephus (The Antiquities of the Jews, Book 20, Chapter 9)\n \n Here Josephus refers to Jesus Ben Damneus, an actual historical person. If you read on, in the same paragraph, Josephus tells us that there were appeals to the new procurator (not over the stoning of James but because of the calling of the Sanhedrin by Ananus) and:\n \n \"... Albinus complied with what they said, and wrote in anger to Ananus, and threatened that he would bring him to punishment for what he had done; on which king Agrippa took the high priesthood from him, when he had ruled but three months, and made Jesus, the son of Damneus, high priest.\"\n \n Obviously, this is either someone else who liked to think he was the Messiah, or the \"who was called the Christ\" part was a later addition. Or, Jesus Christ was not the son of a carpenter named Joseph, or from Nazareth, but a high priest.\n \n As I said, I find it interesting that Harry Potter is so much more popular, because of claims that he is the Anti-Christ, being used to indoctrinate children against right-wing christianity. I found this idea absolutely absurd, but then maybe the wackos are on to something.",

   "The recent Harry Potter movie is breaking box-office records, and is notably more popular than The Passion of the Christ, despite all the controversy and church efforts to get people to go see the latter. Over the past few days since release, The Prisoner of Azkaban has sold US$114.8 million worth of tickets in its opening weekend, just under \"Spiderman\"'s record, and much higher than the graphic movie about \"Jesus' last day\"($76.2 million). Apparently a children's film about wizards and Hippogriffs is more interesting to most people than a gory flick about the \"torture and martyrdom\" of a supposed God. Go figure. \n \n Interestingly, fundamentalist Christians see the popularity of the Potter series as the preparation and indoctrination of children for the \"coming Anti-Christ\". They cite the author's use of mythological and pagan symbolism along with similarities with Jesus' story as further evidence of the author's \"Satanism\". It seems to go right over their heads that Jesus' story is just a rewrite of much earlier pagan Sun God/Saviour King myths, shared by mythological figures from Egypt (King Amenhotep and the God Horus), Greece (Dionysius), Persia (Mithra) Asia and South Asia (Buddha and Krishna) all much older than myth about Jesus or Satan. Nobody has yet dared to recommend that churches adopt a teenage heart-throb as figurehead in order to increase membership.\n\n Jesus was not very popular in his time. After all, he was crucified. He also told us that his followers would be persecuted. So I'm not sure how effective it is to measure his worth by movie sales. But maybe we could look to book sales :) (But I think might have heard somewhere that the Bible has been surpassed???

   "And if it is - why do people do that? History is hard enough to study....\n\n 1. Because they want to prove that Jesus existed and they can't find any real evidence.\n \n 2. Because they want to make money.\n \n Relics have long been a good source of cash for churches and \"discoverers\".\n \n \nRegardless, Jesus was a historical figure -\n\n Stating a hyopthesis as fact does ot make it true. If you can find some valid evidence that there was a singular Jesus as described in the Gospels, I'll believe it.\n \n \nMizmaxx you say many Jesus' exist according to Josephus.\n\n Yes. Jesus was a common name at the time. Neither was \"Christ\" an uncommon moniker. \n \n \nYou are simply supposing that none of them are THE Jesus. There are many mentioned, but how many are mentioned at the right 'time'?\nKenneth Humphreys-\n Was there a Jesus? Of course there was a Jesus - many!\n \n The archetypal Jewish hero was Joshua (the successor of Moses) otherwise known as Yeshua ben Nun ('Jesus of the fish'). Since the name Jesus (Yeshua or Yeshu in Hebrew, Ioshu in Greek, source of the English spelling) originally was a title (meaning 'saviour', derived from 'Yahweh Saves') probably every band in the Jewish resistance had its own hero figure sporting this moniker, among others.\n \n Josephus, the first century Jewish historian mentions no fewer than nineteen different Yeshuas/Jesii, about half of them contemporaries of the supposed Christ! In his Antiquities, of the twenty -eight high priests who held office from the reign of Herod the Great to the fall of the Temple, no fewer than four bore the name Jesus: Jesus ben Phiabi, Jesus ben Sec, Jesus ben Damneus and Jesus ben Gamaliel. Even Saint Paul makes reference to a rival magician, preaching 'another Jesus' (2 Corinthians 11,4). The surfeit of early Jesuses includes:\n \n Jesus ben Sirach, reputedly the author of the Book of Sirach (aka 'Ecclesiasticus, or the Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach'). part of Old Testament apocrypha. This Jesus, writing in Greek about 180 B.C.E., brought together Jewish 'wisdom' and Homeric-style heroes.\n \n Jesus ben Pandira. A wonder-worker during the reign of Alexander Jannaeus (106-79 B.C.), one of the most ruthless of the Maccabean kings. Imprudently, this Jesus launched into a career of end-time prophesy and agitation which upset the king. He met his own premature end-time by being hung on a tree - and on the eve of a Passover. Scholars have speculated this Jesus founded the Essene sect.\n \n Jesus ben Ananias. Beginning in 62AD, this Jesus had caused disquiet in Jerusalem with a non-stop doom-laden mantra of 'Woe to the city'. He prophesied rather vaguely:\n \n 'A voice from the east, a voice from the west, a voice from the four winds, a voice against Jerusalem and the holy house, a voice against the bridegrooms and the brides, and a voice against the whole people.'\n (Josephus, Wars 6:3)\n \n Arrested and flogged by the Romans, he was released as nothing more dangerous than a mad man. He died during the siege of Jerusalem from a rock hurled by a Roman catapult.\n \n Jesus ben Saphat. In the insurrection of 68AD that wrought havoc in Galilee, this Jesus had led the rebels in Tiberias. When the city was about to fall to Vespasian's legionaries he fled north to Tarichea on the Sea of Galilee. \n \n Too strange to be a coincidence!\n \n \n According to the Biblical account, Pilate offered the Jews the release of just one prisoner and the \"cursed race\" chose Barabbas rather than gentle Jesus.\n \n But hold on a minute: in the original text studied by Origen (and in some recent ones) the chosen criminal was Jesus Barabbas - and Bar Abba in Hebrew means 'Son of the Father'!\n \n Are we to believe that Pilate had a Jesus, Son of God and a Jesus, Son of the Father in his prison at the same time??!!\n \n Perhaps the truth is that a single executed criminal helped flesh out the whole fantastic fable. Gospel writers, in scrambling details, used the Aramaic Barabbas knowing that few Latin or Greek speakers would know its meaning.\n Jesus ben Gamala. During 68/69 AD this Jesus was a leader of the 'peace party' in the civil war wrecking Judaea. From the walls of Jerusalem he had remonstrated with the besieging Idumeans (led by 'James and John, sons of Susa'). It did him no good. When the Idumeans breached the walls he was put to death and his body thrown to the dogs and carrion birds.\n Jesus ben Thebuth. A priest who, in the final capitulation of the upper city in 69AD, saved his own skin by surrendering the treasures of the Temple, which included two holy candlesticks, goblets of pure gold, sacred curtains and robes of the high priests. The booty figured prominently in the Triumph held for Vespasian and his son Titus.\n \n \n But was there a crucified Jesus? Certainly. Jesus ben Stada was a Judean agitator who gave the Romans a headache in the early years of the second century. He met his end in the town of Lydda (twenty five miles from Jerusalem) at the hands of a Roman crucifixion crew. And given the scale that Roman retribution could reach - at the height of the siege of Jerusalem the Romans were crucifying upwards of five hundred captives a day before the city walls - dead heroes called Jesus would (quite literally) have been thick on the ground. Not one merits a full-stop in the great universal history.\n \n \n But then with so many Jesuses could there not have been a Jesus of Nazareth?\n \n The problem for this notion is that absolutely nothing at all corroborates the sacred biography and yet this 'greatest story' is peppered with numerous anachronisms, contradictions and absurdities. For example, at the time that Joseph and the pregnant Mary are said to have gone off to Bethlehem for a supposed Roman census, Galilee (unlike Judaea) was not a Roman province and therefore ma and pa would have had no reason to make the journey. Even if Galilee had been imperial territory, history knows of no 'universal census' ordered by Augustus (nor any other emperor) - and Roman taxes were based on property ownership not on a head count. Then again, we now know that Nazareth did not exist before the second century.\n \n Nazareth -\n The Town that Theology Built\n \n \n It is mentioned not at all in the Old Testament nor by Josephus, who waged war across the length and breadth of Galilee (a territory about the size of Greater London) and yet Josephus records the names of dozens of other towns. In fact most of the 'Jesus-action' takes place in towns of equally doubtful provenance, in hamlets so small only partisan Christians know of their existence (yet well attested pagan cities, with extant ruins, failed to make the Jesus itinerary).\n \n \n What should alert us to wholesale fakery here is that practically all the events of Jesus's supposed life appear in the lives of mythical figures of far more ancient origin. Whether we speak of miraculous birth, prodigious youth, miracles or wondrous healings - all such 'signs' had been ascribed to other gods, centuries before any Jewish holy man strolled about. Jesus's supposed utterances and wisdom statements are equally common place, being variously drawn from Jewish scripture, neo-Platonic philosophy or commentaries made by Stoic and Cynic sages. \n \n In any case, the burden of evidence is on you. Either show evidence that one of those Jesus Christs was the Jesus of the Gospels, or admit that you are going on faith, not evidence.\n \n \nbecause regardless of which version you know of, Jesus is still mentioned! \n\n Sorry, but just because some christian apologist scholars believe that part of that forgery is original does not make it so. Have you no other evidence than the possibly-not-forged portion of a completely spurious bit of text (that you originally tried to pass off on this thread as authentic also)?\n \n Note that one of the \"sources\" quoted in your post is from a site which argues that Jesus Christ is entirely mythical. The portion you took out of context was preceded by the following introduction- \n \nIn an alternate universe to this one, scholars investigating Christianity's origins are a happy lot. (...)\n \n When scholars in that alternate universe step outside the writings of the Christian movement itself, they find that widespread notice was taken of the new faith and its founder by the contemporary world. The Alexandrian philosopher Philo had mentioned his death under Pilate (...)\n\n Therefore the author was saying that Philo might have mentioned Jesus in an alternate universe. He didn't mention him in ours.\n \n The next paragraph reads:\n \nIn a different universe to that one, scholars are not so fortunate, or so happy. There, the canonical Gospels are also seen as possessing questionable historical reliability, built as they are on midrashic principles which seem to draw entirely on scriptural precedent. In that world, however, scholars cannot turn to the early Christian record outside the Gospels for information on Jesus of Nazareth, for strangely enough it contains virtually nothing about the reputed human founder of Christianity. In the New Testament epistles they can discover no attribution of earthly teachings to him, no miracle working, no details of his life and death. The places of his career are never mentioned, let alone visited; the figures populating the Gospel story seem unknown. Rival apostles of the Christ preach and debate and express themselves without any appeal to an earthly Jesus, and speak of the beginning of their movement and their knowledge of the Son of God they worship in terms of revelation and inspiration from scripture, with God himself as the source of their ethic and impulse. Their Christ is a cosmic redeemer unlinked to a recent historical man, one who bears uncanny resemblance to a raft of mythical savior gods of the time. Within the non-Christian record, the silence on any human founder of Christianity echoes forlornly for almost the first hundred years of the movement.\n\n \n \nyour sources are discredited.\n\n Did you not read my reply? Origin was not referring to the Testimonium Flavianum there, he was referring to the time Josephus spoke of Jesus Ben Damneus. Thus the quote reads \"Not a single writer before the 4th century - not Justin, Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian, Cyprian, Arnobius, etc. - in all their defences against pagan hostility, makes a single reference to Josephus' wondrous words.\" \n \n \"Wondrous words\" refers here to the Testimonium Flavianum.

It doesn't matter anyway if he didn't (although he does), simply because you're not debating that Jesus is or isn't Christ, but that there's no historic Jesus (in the sense of 'the' Jesus). But your source is discredited because he quotes an historic Jesus (through an historic brother of Jesus) in Josephus. Thus, your contention that there is no historic Jesus is not borne out by Origen's readings of Josephus.\n \n Your work is discredited because quite clearly, in quoting from Josephus in his commentary above, Origen mentions Jesus whom he reocognises as Jesus who is called Christ. He does so also (below) in \"Against Celsus\". Your use of your source is not in your favour also because of the 'extensive quotes from Josephus' he mentions one work \"Antiquities of the Jews\" above and in it he refers to James the brother of (THE) Jesus. Your contention is that there are lots of Jesus'. How many of them have a brother called James? This probelm only widens for you, as I'll show below.\n \n Further, there's a real illogical statement which goes to bias; that Josephus, a Jew doesn't believe in Jesus as Christ! Well that's simply stunning proof. I know dozens of Jews who don't believe in Him. It is a slight re-working of the theme in Against Celsus, but the reader can see that when they read the full paragraph below.\n \n \"I would like to say to Celsus, who represents the Jew as accepting somehow John as a Baptist, who baptized Jesus, that the existence of John the Baptist, baptizing for the remission of sins, is related by one who lived no great length of time after John and Jesus. For in the 18th book of his Antiquities of the Jews, Josephus bears witness to John as having been a Baptist, and as promising purification to those who underwent the rite. Now this writer, although not believing in Jesus as the Christ, in seeking after the cause of the fall of Jerusalem and the destruction of the temple, whereas he ought to have said that the conspiracy against Jesus was the cause of these calamities befalling the people, since they put to death Christ, who was a prophet, says nevertheless--being, although against his will, not far from the truth--that these disasters happened to the Jews as a punishment for the death of James the Just, who was a brother of Jesus (called Christ),--the Jews having put him to death, although he was a man most distinguished for his justice. Paul, a genuine disciple of Jesus, says that he regarded this James as a brother of the Lord, not so much on account of their relationship by blood, or of their being brought up together, as because of his virtue and doctrine. If, then, he says that it was on account of James that the desolation of Jerusalem was made to overtake the Jews, how should it not be more in accordance with reason to say that it happened on account (of the death) of Jesus Christ, of whose divinity so many Churches are witnesses, composed of those who have been convened from a flood of sins, and who have joined themselves to the Creator, and who refer all their actions to His good pleasure.\n Origen, Against Celsus, 1:47\n http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/origen161.html\n \n As I said, he recognises that a Jew doesn't acknowledge Jesus as Christ. News Flash! A Jew who denies Jesus as Christ? Important to your argument however, is that he mentions (THE) Jesus at all. In this case in the context of John the Baptist. \n \n Further to that, the supposed forgery says \"brother of Jesus the so-called Christ...\". This is in line with Origen saying that Josephus didn't believe in Jesus as Christ. In Addition to that, why didn't the Christian 'forgers' mention the single most important fact for Christians; the resurrection! Nor does he present any of Christ's teachings, whereas he spends some time on John the Baptist's. Obviously the Christian forgers forgot to include the Christian message, too!\n \"(T)here is a specific use of non-Christian terminology: The designation of James as the \"brother of Jesus\" contrasts with Christian practice of referring to him as the \"brother of the Lord\" or \"brother of the Savoir.\" (as in Gal. 1:19 in the NT and Eusebius in later history). The passage \"squares neither with New Testament nor with early patristic usage.\"\n http://www.tektonics.org/tekton_01_01_01_JOS.html\n \n Even when you remove the so-called Christian inserts you still get...\n \"Now, there was about this time Jesus, a wise man . . . . For he was one who wrought surprising feats and was a teacher of such people as accept the truth gladly. He won over many Jews and many of the Greeks. . . . When Pilate, upon hearing him accused by men of the highest standing among us, had condemned him to be crucified, those who had in the first place come to love him did not give up their affection for him. . . . And the tribe of Christians, so called after him, has still to this day not disappeared (18.3.3). \n Following Patterson, I have excluded the places that scholars agree are later Christian interpolations.\"\n http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/james_still/historical_jesus.html\n \n Further to that, you ignore similarities in the style of the writings of the supposed 're-edited' version and the original...\n \"As acknowledged even by proponents of the forgery theory, the style and vocabulary of the passage is essentially that of Josephus (cf. the studies employing the Rengstorf concordance and the TLG database). Thus, an imitator must have made a substantial effort to create something Josephus might have written. This effort by the imitator would have been hindered, not aided, by taking passages from Luke as a model, as this would add a foreign voice to the text. Since the proposed imitator wished people to mistake the passage for a Josephus original, it would have been perverse to employ a text that would undermine this goal -- indeed, it is such foreign elements that have caused scholars to suspect a forgery.\"\n http://members.aol.com/FLJOSEPHUS/question.htm\n \n The Arabic version says...\n \"Similarly Josephus the Hebrew. For he says in the treatises that he has written on the governance of the Jews:\n At this time there was a wise man who was called Jesus. And his conduct was good, and he was known to be virtuous. And many people from among the Jews and the other nations became his disciples. Pilate condemned him to be crucified and to die. And those who had become his disciples did not abandon his discipleship. They reported that he had appeared to themafter his crucifixion and that he was alive; accordingly, he was perhaps the Messiah concerning whom the prophets have recounted wonders.\"\n http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~humm/Topics/JewishJesus/josephus.html\n \n So the question is...\"What do we learn about Jesus and or Christianity from this historian/writer?\n Josephus ends up being a rich source for confirmation of the Gospel record:\n Jesus had a brother named James, who was an important member of the church; \n Jesus was a wise and virtuous man; \n Jesus had disciples, both among the Jews and Gentiles. Although Meier regards the latter as retorjectory in nature, we may suggest that it is something that simply lacked emphasis in the Gospels. \n Jesus was called \"Christ\" by some. \n Jesus was a worker of surprising deeds - an allusion perhaps to miracle-working power. \n Jesus was executed by Pilate by means of crucifixion. \n His execution was prompted in part by the leaders among the Jews. \n Christians were \"named\" from Him - which confirms Tacitus' own usage of the terminology.\"\n http://www.tektonics.org/tekton_01_01_01_JOS.html\n So, even though you content that there's dozens of Jesus', we've got one with a connection to a brother named James, who was baptised by John the Baptist and executed by Pilate, has a brother called James, etc.\n \n Your other problem in dismissing Christ, are Christians. You would have to suggest that a group of people one day decided to make someone up. The very appearance of a movement, and churches, and teachings etc are very very hard for you to explain.\n \n \n Another problem is you may not be aware of more recent evidence... http://members.aol.com/FLJOSEPHUS/testimonium.htm\n \n So ignoring all these things, I think you've got a case!",

Thus, your contention that there is no historic Jesus is not borne out by Origen's readings of Josephus.\n\n Again, you aren't reading my responses completely. The passage you are referring to is as follows-\n \n(...) when, therefore, Ananus was of this disposition, he thought he had now a proper opportunity. Festus was dead, and Albinus was but upon the road; so he assembled the Sanhedrin of judges and brought before them the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James, and some others; and when he had formed an accusation against them as breakers of the law, he delivered them to be stoned.\n\n \n A tiny little half-sentence that confirms, for you, the historicity of Jesus. This little half-sentence is clearly an insertion, because the paragraph is actually in reference to another Jesus (who had a brother James), Jesus Ben Damneus, who was clearly not the Christ of the Gospels. This is obvious to anyone who bothers to read on past the former quote to the following-\n \n(...) Albinus complied with what they said, and wrote in anger to Ananus, and threatened that he would bring him to punishment for what he had done; on which king Agrippa took the high priesthood from him, when he had ruled but three months, and made Jesus, the son of Damneus, high priest.\n\n \n So, unless you believe Jesus Ben Damneus the High Priest is the Gospel Christ (which is also contrary to evidence), that's another \"proof\" of Jesus' supposed historicity gone. So what have you further?\n \n \nSo, even though you content that there's dozens of Jesus', we've got one with a connection to a brother named James, who was baptised by John the Baptist and executed by Pilate, has a brother called James, etc.\n\n The one with the brother named James is Jesus Ben Damneus. \n \n The reference to Celsus by Origen only shows that Celsus mentions John the Baptist. John the Baptist is an actual historical figure, probably an Essene, and is mentioned by many historians of the age. Christ is not. Therefore Origen writes of Celsus \"represents the Jew as accepting somehow John as a Baptist, who baptized Jesus\". In other words, Celsus \"accepts\" John the Baptist because he writes of him, and Origen cannot understand why Celsus does not mention Jesus Christ at the same time, because Origen believes the scriptural account of John baptising Jesus. However, as John was an actual person, but Jesus was not, this makes perfect sense.\n \n As for the Testimonium Flavianum, again, this is a contentious passage. As part of it is clearly a forgery, I don't think you should expect people to believe this Reader's Digest version of the Gospels is authentic. Especially as Josephus makes no other reference to this character before or after. If all you have as evidence of a historical Christ is extracted from a forgery, you'll pardon me if I don't hop on the bandwagon. It would take more than that to prove the spurious Gospel accounts. Like an actual contemporary witness.\n \n \nYour other problem in dismissing Christ, are Christians. You would have to suggest that a group of people one day decided to make someone up. The very appearance of a movement, and churches, and teachings etc are very very hard for you to explain.\n\n Er, no actually, they're very very easy to explain. The cult of Jesus was merely one of literally hundreds of small messianic and apocalyptic groups of the day. Nothing about the Jesus story is original, all the factors in his \"biography\" can be found in the stories of other Gods, such as Mithra, Horus, etc. The fact is that these stories arose at a time when the Jewish community was experiencing severe persecution, and they were clearly searching for some reason why God had abandoned his chosen people. Thus, many people started to say that the Messiah had come but he had not been noticed. Many people thought this was John the Baptist, who had a very influential movement behind him as Messiah. \n \n In point of fact, your argument here is strange. After all, churches and belief systems abound in their diversity. Would you argue that simply because people believe in anything that it must be true?\n \n \nAnother problem is you may not be aware of more recent evidence...\n\n That isn't evidence. It just seems that the person who forged the passages copied these from the Gospel of Luke. \n \n How do you explain Josephus, who reviled and vilified all other \"Messiah\"s and rabblerousers, speaking positively about this 'christ', in fact laundry-listing the events claimed in the Gospels?\n \n If all you have is the Testimonium, again, that is seriously thin ice.",

   "Without reference to a particular passage you say that Jesus who is not 'the' Jesus had a brother called James.\n As you say there are 'so many Jesus' you need to tell me which bit you're getting that James is the brother of a Jesus, not 'the Jesus'.\n \n Do you mean...?\n \"AND now Caesar, upon hearing the death of Festus, sent Albinus into Judea, as procurator. But the king deprived Joseph of the high priesthood, and bestowed the succession to that dignity on the son of Ananus, who was also himself called Ananus. Now the report goes that this eldest Ananus proved a most fortunate man; for he had five sons who had all performed the office of a high priest to God, and who had himself enjoyed that dignity a long time formerly, which had never happened to any other of our high priests. But this younger Ananus, who, as we have told you already, took the high priesthood, was a bold man in his temper, and very insolent; he was also of the sect of the Sadducees, (23) who are very rigid in judging offenders, above all the rest of the Jews, as we have already observed; when, therefore, Ananus was of this disposition, he thought he had now a proper opportunity [to exercise his authority]. Festus was now dead, and Albinus was but upon the road; so he assembled the sanhedrim of judges, and brought before them the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James, and some others, [or, some of his companions]; and when he had formed an accusation against them as breakers of the law, he delivered them to be stoned: but as for those who seemed the most equitable of the citizens, and such as were the most uneasy at the breach of the laws, they disliked what was done; they also sent to the king [Agrippa], desiring him to send to Ananus that he should act so no more, for that what he had already done was not to be justified; nay, some of them went also to meet Albinus, as he was upon his journey from Alexandria, and informed him that it was not lawful for Ananus to assemble a sanhedrim without his consent. (24) Whereupon Albinus complied with what they said, and wrote in anger to Ananus, and threatened that he would bring him to punishment for what he had done; on which king Agrippa took the high priesthood from him, when he had ruled but three months, and made Jesus, the son of Damneus, high priest.\"\n Antiquities of the Jews - Book XX\n http://www.ccel.org/j/josephus/works/ant-20.htm\n \n The title of this chapter is the clue you missed. the chapter is titled \"CONCERNING ALBINUS UNDER WHOSE PROCURATORSHIP JAMES WAS SLAIN; AS ALSO WHAT EDIFICES WERE BUILT BY AGRIPPA.\"\n \n Albinus succeeded Festus to this post in 62AD. James is referred to as \"the brother of Jesus called Christ\". 62AD is after Jesus' ministry. Thus, the other 'Jesus' is a different man, which is why he is called \"Jesus the son of Damneus.\"\n \n This is a passage about James, It refers to Jesus Christ only in reference to James, or rather, James only in reference to Jesus Christ, so the reader knows which James we're looking at. The other man, named 'Jesus' is mentioned in relationship to a different man, so quite clearly he's not the Jesus related to James. If he were, Josephus would say 'this Jesus who is the brother of James, was made High Priest', or 'Jesus, the son of Joseph was made High Priest.' He doesn't. It's because this Jesus who is made High Priest is not the brother of James, nor is He the son of Joseph. He is Jesus, the son of Damneus.\n \n For your theory to work, Jesus (Christ) lived until at least 62AD when he became High Priest, and even though he's Jesus, son of Joseph, was somehow now called Jesus son of Damneus, who, even though his teachings were condemned, was made High Priest, who, even though his brother was also condemned, was made High Priest, who, even though he was executed by Pilate, who wasn't around in 62AD, was still alive in 62AD and was made high priest - no doubt because he survived his execution!\n \n Or, are you referring to another passage? I looked through Books XVIII-XX, as well as \"The Life Of Flavius Josephus\" and the only 'Damneus' reference was the one above, and an even later one where \"Jesus, the son of Gamaliel, became the successor of Jesus, the son of Damneus\". Note the man Jesus is referred to in relation to his father Damneus again, not Joseph, or James, so these Jesus' have a different relationship, so quite clearly aren't either the same man as each other, nor are they Jesus Christ. Your reasoning would have Jesus son of Gamaliel and Jesus son of Damneus as the same man, simply because Jesus is mentioned twice; even more compelling is that here they're not only in the same paragraph, but in the same sentence!",

This is all very much like the supposed remains of James which turned out to be a forgery. \n \n All you have are two passages, both spurious. Do you have any passages that are not forged which speak of a Jesus of the Gospels? Do you have any evidence that the Jesus and James mentioned there are the Jesus and James of the Gospels? No, just that you proclaim that the possibly spurious passage \"who was called the Christ\" (exactly the same wording as the forgery), which only proves, if it is believed to be authentic, that there was a Jesus walking around that people called \"the Christ\".

That's very forgiving of them.\n\n 1- Where does it say that this James is killed for \"believing in Jesus as Christ\"? Nowhere. It says they broke the law, and were stoned for it in an unofficial sanhedrim. Stick to the actual evidence, spurious though it may be.\n \n 2- The passage clearly describes that other people (\"those who seemed the most equitable of the citizens\") disagreed with the stoning (so much for claims of Christian martyrdom), and told on Ananus. As a result, the priesthood was taken from him, and given to the brother of the man who was killed. Even if the person given the priesthood from Ananus was another Jesus, the passage only proves, if it is to be believed, that there existed (30 years after the supposed time of Christ) a man named James who had a brother named Jesus, who may have been called the Christ. None of this is a news flash, as people called Jesus, and James, as well as the number of people given the moniker \"the Christ\" (especially when they were also called Jesus), were extremely common at the time.\n \n Do you have any evidence that the Jesus descibed in this passage is not one of the many Jesus' roaming about, that he wasn't for example any of the following Jesus' mentioned by Josephus-\n \n \nJesus ben Sirach, reputedly the author of the Book of Sirach (aka 'Ecclesiasticus, or the Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach'). part of Old Testament apocrypha. This Jesus, writing in Greek about 180 B.C.E., brought together Jewish 'wisdom' and Homeric-style heroes.\n \n Jesus ben Pandira. A wonder-worker during the reign of Alexander Jannaeus (106-79 B.C.), one of the most ruthless of the Maccabean kings. Imprudently, this Jesus launched into a career of end-time prophesy and agitation which upset the king. He met his own premature end-time by being hung on a tree - and on the eve of a Passover. Scholars have speculated this Jesus founded the Essene sect.\n \n Jesus ben Ananias. Beginning in 62AD, this Jesus had caused disquiet in Jerusalem with a non-stop doom-laden mantra of 'Woe to the city'. He prophesied rather vaguely:\n \n 'A voice from the east, a voice from the west, a voice from the four winds, a voice against Jerusalem and the holy house, a voice against the bridegrooms and the brides, and a voice against the whole people.'\n (Josephus, Wars 6:3)\n \n Arrested and flogged by the Romans, he was released as nothing more dangerous than a mad man. He died during the siege of Jerusalem from a rock hurled by a Roman catapult.\n \n Jesus ben Saphat. In the insurrection of 68AD that wrought havoc in Galilee, this Jesus had led the rebels in Tiberias. When the city was about to fall to Vespasian's legionaries he fled north to Tarichea on the Sea of Galilee. \n \n Too strange to be a coincidence:\n \n According to the Biblical account, Pilate offered the Jews the release of just one prisoner and the cursed race chose Barabbas rather than gentle Jesus.\n \n But hold on a minute: in the original text studied by Origen (and in some recent ones) the chosen criminal was Jesus Barabbas - and Bar Abba in Hebrew means 'Son of the Father'!\n \n Are we to believe that Pilate had a Jesus, Son of God and a Jesus, Son of the Father in his prison at the same time??!!\n \n Perhaps the truth is that a single executed criminal helped flesh out the whole fantastic fable. Gospel writers, in scrambling details, used the Aramaic Barabbas knowing that few Latin or Greek speakers would know its meaning.\n \n Jesus ben Gamala. During 68/69 AD this Jesus was a leader of the 'peace party' in the civil war wrecking Judaea. From the walls of Jerusalem he had remonstrated with the besieging Idumeans (led by 'James and John, sons of Susa'). It did him no good. When the Idumeans breached the walls he was put to death and his body thrown to the dogs and carrion birds.\n \n Jesus ben Thebuth. A priest who, in the final capitulation of the upper city in 69AD, saved his own skin by surrendering the treasures of the Temple, which included two holy candlesticks, goblets of pure gold, sacred curtains and robes of the high priests. The booty figured prominently in the Triumph held for Vespasian and his son Titus.\n \n But was there a crucified Jesus? Certainly. Jesus ben Stada was a Judean agitator who gave the Romans a headache in the early years of the second century. He met his end in the town of Lydda (twenty five miles from Jerusalem) at the hands of a Roman crucifixion crew. And given the scale that Roman retribution could reach - at the height of the siege of Jerusalem the Romans were crucifying upwards of five hundred captives a day before the city walls - dead heroes called Jesus would (quite literally) have been thick on the ground. \nKenneth Humphreys\n \n \nIs it Acts 8 or in one of Paul's Epistles?\n\n 2 Corinthians 11,4. \n \n \nCould you clarify your position?

It can be debated whether this belief comes from the mythological (such as the Cretan bull in profile fighting the Lion which became the Lion and the Unicorn, as some postulate), from the mythological metaphor, from seeing mixes of bone remains and thinking they were one animal, or from forgers and story-tellers (which abounded).

Had they not, we could easily compare various versions of these ancient texts to discern what is forged vs what is original.\n \n It is also possible that the original intention of the title \"brother of Christ\" was mistranslated literally from Paul; \"brother of Christ\" could simply have meant that he was \"Christian\". Remember that Paul's writings predate the Gospels.

It is possible that the quote describes Jesus by mentioning his parents, then his followers. Thus, first it is read that someone named James was a \"brother of Christ\" in Acts, he is mentioned many times in the Gospels in a similar way, and later translations misunderstand the passages to mean literal genetic brother.\n \n Again, either way you slice it, you don't have any solid evidence.",

Alan Millard, Discoveries From the Time of Jesus \n \n The tombs were discovered during the rebuilding of a Franciscan chapel and excavated from 1953 to 1955. \n \n \"A tomb of the Late Bronze period gave finds which are important for the civilization of Jerusalem just at the time of its conquest by the Hebrews. A necropolis used from 136 BC to 300 AD produced a great amount of material. The necropolis had two periods each with different styles and cultures. The first, the earlier is characterized by Kokhim (oven-shaped) tombs running from 185 BC, while the second is characterized by tombs with an arcosolium belonging to the 3rd and 4th centuries AD. With the Kokhim tombs are closely connected the sarcophagus and the ossuary; the first cut in hard stone (mizzi) follow the motifs of classical art, both in structure and subject, in close artistic relation with the Tombs of the kings and 'Herod's' of the 1 cent. AD; the ossuaries, on the other hand in soft stone (kacooley) follow a local trade technique with architectonic and floral motifs. \n \"On the ossuaries were found many more or less symbol signs (crosses, tau, Constantinian monograms) and 43 inscriptions (Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek) incised or traced with charcoal. Of interest is the recurrence of names common in the New Testament, as Mary, Martha, Philo the Cyrene, Matthew, Joseph, Jesus.\" \n - Dominus Flevit the site where \"The Lord Wept\" \n \n Caesar's Decree - c. 50 C.E.\n \"A stone slab found in Nazareth, of height 0.61m is inscribed (in Greek) with a decree demanding the death penalty for anyone who broke the seals on a tomb or stole a dead body.\" (Attributed date c. 50 C.E.) \n - Summarized extract - IVP Three Volume Bible Dictionary (under section for Nazareth) \n \n \"It is my pleasure that graves and tombs remain undisturbed in perpetuity for those who have made them for the cult of their ancestors, or children, or members of their house. If, however, any man lay information that another has either demolished them, or has in any other way extracted the buried, or has maliciously transferred them to other places in order to wrong them, or has displaced the sealing or other stones, against such a one I order that a trial be instituted, as in respect of the gods, so in regard to the cult of mortals. For it shall be much more obligatory to honour the buried. Let it be absolutely forbidden for anyone to disturb them. In the case of contravention I desire that the offender be sentenced to capital punishment on charge of violation of sepulture.\" \n - Ordinance of Caesar\n \n \"The Emperor threatens the death penalty for interference with, or the removal of bodies from, tombs, may belong to any date from Augustus to Claudius.\" \n - Summarized extract - Peakes Commentary of the Bible \n (Various sections found from index under Claudius' expulsion of Jews from Rome and Tombs, sanctity of.) \n \n The original owner of the stone left only a short note about its origins when he donated it to the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale in Paris - \"Marble slab sent from Nazareth in 1878.\" \n \n \"Nazareth may be the place, but the finder could have carried it there from somewhere else, a few days' donkey journey away, wanting to sell it to Christian pilgrims. Since the nature of the connection with Nazareth is uncertain, no argument linking the stone with the early Christians can rely on its. Unless the stone was set up on Judaea and moved northwards later, Pontius Pilate cannot have had it made, because Galilee was in the kingdom of Herod Antipas, where Pilate had no power. Indeed, even a decree of Caesar would hardly be displayed in Galilee until after Antipas' reign ended in AD 44. That means it is possible that Claudius made the decree.\" \n - Alan Millard, Discoveries From the Time of Jesus \n \n \"Why would a Caesar have any cause to take such a specific interest in this part of the Empire and in a matter which, apparently, not an issue of Roman state? Surely this would seem to be better resolved by local Government and not one to demand the intervention of the Emperor. However, if the implications of any such alleged activity had affected Rome that would make it more understandable.\" \n - Mark Carlin \n \n Chrestus, the Instigator - 50 C.E.\n \"Expulsion of Jews from Rome reported by Suetonius (Claud. 25.) and Orosius (Hist. VII, vi, 15) . Orosius puts this in Claudius' ninth year, 25th Jan. AD 49 - 24th Jan. AD 50. The later claiming to have extracted the date from Josephus, however, our copies of Josephus do not contain such an entry. Claudius had expelled from Rome the Jews who were 'incessantly causing tumults with Chrestus as the instigator'.\" \n - Summarized extract - Peakes Commentary of the Bible: \n \n \"Since the Jews were constantly causing disturbances at the instigation of Chrestus, he [Claudius] expelled them from Rome.\" \n - Suetonius, Lives of the Caesars - Claudius 5.25.4 (c. 120 CE) \n \n \"The Emperor Claudius, around the year 49-50, expelled the Jews from Rome (Acts 18:2) because (says Suetonius) they were fomenting disorder at the instigation of one Chrestos. It seems plausible that there were disputes in Rome between Jews who believed that the body of Jesus was missing from the tomb because he had risen, and Jews who believed that it had been stolen. When these disputes caused public disorder, Claudius (or his deputy) made inquiries, expelled both sides from the city (after the manner of a parent who, when two children are fighting over a toy, takes it away from both of them for the time being), and then ordered a stern decree against grave-robbing to be promulgated at the places where the disturbance had begun. Presumably these would include at least (1) Jerusalem, where the alleged corpse-snatching had taken place, and (2) Nazareth, the home town of the alleged corpse.\" \n - James Kiefer \n \n \"The report that Claudius expelled the Jews from Rome in A.D. 41 because they were, 'at the instigation of Chrestus, repeatedly rioting,' probably refers to some local troublemaker.\" \n - Morton Smith, Jesus the Magician: Charlatan or Son of God? (1978) p. 66 \n \n \"A short note on the name 'Chrestus': From the examination of the Greek for Chrestus and Christos I have observed that the former is a common slave name which has the basic meaning of 'good' and the latter derived from the rare Greek word (rare or just closest?) 'to anoint' and thus Christos is the best match for the Aramaic word 'messiah' - which also, essentially means 'anointed one' with the Jewish associations of king, etc. What may be important is that while both names basically mean something different from each other they are, I have read, phonetically the same.\" \n - Mark Carlin \n \n \"'Chrestus' is the correct Latin form of a very common Greek name and is not a misspelling, but some scholars believe that Seutonius meant to use 'Christos' instead. One problem with this (if indeed Seutonius was referring to Christ) is that the context of the passage suggests that someone named Chrestus was living in Rome at the time, a century after Jesus. Kee and Wells get around this problem by assuming that Seutonius was referring to Christian preachers who were announcing that the Messiah in Jesus was coming. Kee (Jesus in History) also adds that Suetonius may have had his dates confused and was instead referring to the actual disturbances that occurred during the reign of Tiberius (14-37 CE). Wells (The Jesus of the Early Christians) is not as generous and sticks closer to the known in that 'Chrestus' was probably an agitator who emerged from the Roman ghetto proclaiming himself as the Messiah. Messianic fervor ran high during the time of the fall of Jerusalem (70 CE) and this is a highly likely explanation. In any case, it is very difficult to construe from Suetonius anything that even remotely speaks to the historicity of Jesus.\" \n - James Still, \"Biblical and Extrabiblical Sources for Jesus\" \n \n \"Could it be that the expulsion of the \"Jews\" (which might include any associated bickering faction) was as a result of a dispute in which one party had claimed that a grave had been robbed? In my mind, both Aquina and Priscilla were Christian before they were expelled from Rome (though I know this is debated) and migrated to Corinth (Acts). Also, when Paul first visited Rome he was greeted by the 'brethren' (in Acts) which again leads me to the opinion that Rome had Christians from a very early date. \n \"If there is connection between Suetonius' report and the archaeological find in Galilee (and I realize that this is speculative) it raises a distinct possibility that the early critics of Christianity held the view that the Christian claim to a resurrection was a false claim and that the earlier movement had themselves removed the body of the dead Jesus. Also, that the charge was so strongly held and expressed that a tumulus of such magnitude arose which led Caesar Claudius to expel the lot of them rather than risk riots in the streets of Rome.\" \n - Mark Carlin \n \n Thallus' Eclipse - 52 C.E.\n A \"passage on Jesus was contained in Thallus' work on the Eastern Mediterranean world from the Trojan War to 52 A.D. Thallus noted that darkness fell on the land at the time of the crucifixion. He wrote that such a phenomenon was caused by an eclipse.\" \n - Harry V. Martin. \"Proving the Historic Jesus\" \n \n According to McDowell, Evidence that Demands a Verdict, \"Thallus, a Samaritan-born historian mentioned Christ in 52 C.E. However his works are no longer extant, so we have only citations of it by others...Julius Africanus, a Christian writing about 221, says, talking about the darkness that fell when Christ was crucified, 'Thallus, in the third book of his histories, explains away this darkness as an eclipse of the sun -- unreasonably, as it seems to me.' (It is unreasonable because the crucifixion was at Passover, which is based on the lunar calendar and requires a full moon. When there's a full moon, the moon is at the opposite side of the earth from where it has to be for an eclipse.)\". \n \"Phelgon, another first-century historian, is also quoted by Africanus as saying 'during the time of Tiberius Caesar an eclipse of the sun occurred during the full moon'. Phelgon's comment (presumably the same one) is also referred to by Philopon.\" \n - James Kiefer \n \n Mara's Letter - c. 73 C.E.\n \n \"What advantage did the Athenians gain from putting Socrates to death? Famine and plague came upon them as a judgment for their crime. What advantage did the men of Samos gain from burning Pythagoras? In a moment their land was covered with sand. What advantage did the Jews gain from executing their wise king? It was just after that that their kingdom was abolished. God justly avenged these three wise men: the Athenians died of hunger; the Samians were overwhelmed by the sea; the Jews, ruined and driven from their land, live in complete dispersion. But Socrates did not die for good; he lived on in the teaching of Plato. Pythagoras did not die for good; he lived on in the statue of Hera. Nor did the wise king die for good; he lived on in the teaching which he had given.\" \n - Mara bar Serapion, letter to his son from prison\n \n According to F. F. Bruce, The New Testament Documents: Are They Reliable? (p. 114), the Mara bar Serapion letter was \" written some time later than A. D. 73, but how much later we cannot be sure.\" Written in Syriac, this letter may actually have originated in the 2nd or 3rd century C.E. The \"wise king\" is not identified by Mara bar Serapion and may have lived in the same time frame as Socrates and Pythagoras - half a millenium earlier than Jesus. \n \n \"The Bible itself recorded the political assassinations of Jewish royalty that occurred close enough to Nebuchadnezzar's capture of Jerusalem [586 B.C.E.] to consider the conquest of either Israel or Judea as an event that had happened 'just after' the murder of one of these kings. Josiah's father, King Amon, for example, was assassinated less than 50 years before Nebuchadnezzar's siege of Jerusalem (2 Kings 21:23).\" \n - Farrell Till, \"The 'Testimony' of Mara Bar-Serapion\" \n \n \"Amon's officials conspired against him and assassinated the king in his palace.\"\n - 2 Kings 21:23\n \n It should also be noted that the letter contains an historical inaccuracy. Pythagoras was not burned by the men of Samos but died later in Metapontum (contemporary Metaponto), Italy. \n \n Magical Gems and Graffiti - c. 200 C.E.\n \"...Already in Jesus' lifetime magicians began to use his name in their spells. Acts 19.13 shows that the practice was continued, even by Jewish magicians, after his death. Accordingly, of the three oldest representations of the crucifixion, two are on magical gems...\" \n \n \n \"Perhaps the earliest of all representations of the crucifixion is a graffito, a picture scratched on the plaster of a schoolroom on the Palatine hill in Rome. It shows a crucified figure seen from behind. The feet rest on a small crossbar, the head is turned to one side. On that side, slightly below, stands a young man, one hand raised in reference. A misspelled Greek inscription reads 'Alexamenos reveres God.' The date is about 200, possibly a bit before...But the head of the crucified figure is that of a donkey. \n \"There was a long standing legend that the god of the Jews was a donkey, or donkey-headed. The legend probably arose from the fact that the donkey was the sacred animal of Seth, the villain in the Egyptian pantheon, who was commonly thought by the Egyptians to be the god of foreigners. He was also, being a villain, given a large role in magic, and often appears as a donkey-headed figure on magical gems. The Jews were among the largest groups of foreigners in Egypt, so their god, Iao, was identified with Seth. Io or Eio in Coptic means 'donkey,' so the identification was almost predetermined.\" \n - Morton Smith, Jesus the Magician: Charlatan or Son of God?

   "Obviously we're able to discount those that lived decades before His birth.\n\n \nJosephus, the first century Jewish historian mentions no fewer than nineteen different Yeshuas/Jesii, about half of them contemporaries of the supposed Christ\n\n \n There, plenty of Jesuses of the \"correct\" period for you. Several of the Jesuses I listed before were of the same period- Jesus ben Ananias, Jesus ben Saphat, Jesus ben Gamala, Jesus ben Thebuth.\n \n \nHow many of them have a brother James, who were executed by Pilate etc.\n\n Again, James is a common enough name (in its ancient local equivalent as well), and nothing is stated in the passage about James which suggests his brother was executed by Pilate.\n \n \nThat's assuming\n a) the Gospels aren't reliable\n\n I think we can safely say they aren't evidence of a historical Jesus- aside from the sticky point of the eariest references to Jesus being mythological instead of historical (Pauline Christ), there is the fact that as a religious and not historical document it lacks credibility. Otherwise, it could be said that the Bahgavad Gita or any other religious writing is a historical document. They might reference historical events, but they aren't historical evidence themselves. \n \n \nb) Josephus is not reliable\n\n Josephus is reliable, it is the post 4th century Bishop Eusebius forged Testimonium Flavianum which is not. The second supposed reference is not evidence either.\n \n \nc) Tacitus is not reliable\n\n \nNo Christian apologist for centuries ever quoted the passage of Tacitus - not in fact, until it had appeared almost word-for-word in the writings of Sulpicius Severus, in the early fifth century, where it is mixed in with other myths. Sulpicius's contemporaries credited him with a skill in the 'antique' hand. He put it to good use and fantasy was his forte: his Life of St. Martin is replete with numerous 'miracles', including raising of the dead and personal appearances by Jesus and Satan.\nKenneth Humphreys\n That said, Tacitus' supposed paragraph on the subject merely mentions the beliefs of the Christians, and was written after 117 AD, so it does not make very convincing evidence either. The forger also misnames Pilate a \"procurator\", when his title was actually \"prefect\". A procurator was a financial administrator, a prefect a military officer- Judea was under military control in the first century.\n \n \nd) many of the early non cannonical books are not reliable.\n\n Again, these are religious texts, and frankly not even the canonical scriptures are consistent in describing Jesus as a human historical person. \n \n \nYou claim that the 'Jesus' myth was invented over a period of time. This is quite a remarkable achievement that the early Christians not only were prepared to die for their beliefs,\n\n Again, people being willing to die for a belief does not make it true. That said, early Christians would not have been more persecuted than other Jews. The fables about Nero notwithstanding....\n \n \n but that even though their communities were far-flung that they were able to keep a core of beliefs that enabled them to compile a common record 300 years after the events.\n\n They didn't. As I said, views of and descriptions of Jesus have varied, the church in power simply destroyed records which disagreed with whatever they chose as canon. Some have survived, which is why we know how contradictory writings about Jesus are. \n \n \n\n \"Since the Jews were constantly causing disturbances at the instigation of Chrestus, he [Claudius] expelled them from Rome.\"\n - Suetonius, Lives of the Caesars - Claudius 5.25.4 (c. 120 CE) \n\n So now Jesus was in Rome in 55 AD? Er...\n \n \n'Chrestus' does not equate to 'Christ' in English but to 'The Good' in Greek, It was a name used by both slaves and freemen and is attested more than eighty times in Latin inscriptions. Clearly, Suetonius was explaining why the Jews (not Christians) were expelled from Rome and is referring to a Jewish agitator in the 50s - not to a Galilean pacifist of the 30s. \n\n \n \nHere are a list of writings with some conection to Jesus that pre-date Origien\n\n Again, none of these prove anything but a mythical Christ. None of these explain the lack of references to the life of a historical Christ in the earliest writings, with the growth of detail as time goes on. None of this explains how it is that virtually nothing written about Jesus can be seen as uniquely biographical, but all of the stories and sayings about and of Jesus can be found in myths which predate the period of the supposed historical Christ. None of these explain the problems of the non-existence of his supposed hometown, the completely out-of-character actions of Pilate, and the complete silence regarding this figure (who supposedly \"drew multitudes\") by contemporary historians such as Philo, Justus of Tiberius and even Josephus (forgeries aside).",

   "Originally Posted by mizmaxx\n Even in the Bible, I can't remember which Epistle, but some magician is referred to as \"another Jesus\". The name Jesus, as the book of Enoch said in the 2nd century BC, was the secret name given by God to the Son of Man (a Persian title), and that it meant \"Yahweh saves\". Christos was also very common, as all it means is \"anointed one\", and since all sacrificial victims were anointed, and thus all \"kings\" as well, anointed people were all over the place. In fact, the Essenes (the sect that John the Baptist is supoosed to have been a member of), called all their High Priests \"Christos\". Jesus Christ is thus not a name, but a title. It refers not to a singular person, but a mythological Saviour. You may believe that this \"Saviour\" exists on some spiritual plane, perhaps up in a cloudy throne, you're welcome to. But if you want to claim that there was a singular historical person who actually existed as was written in the Gospel stories, you'll have to actually have some evidence.\n\n \n \nOriginally Posted by maximus\n Is it Acts 8 or in one of Paul's Epistles?\n\n \n \nOriginally Posted by mizmaxx\n 2 Corinthians 11,4. \n \n \n \nOriginally Posted by maximus\n Could you clarify your position? In reading the Gospels and noting the manner in which they were written, do you think that the writers were:\n\n \nOriginally Posted by mizmaxx\n 1) desiring to write simply about a mythical conglomeration of a savior that has been turned into what people think is a real man down through the ages--that is, were they writing about a totally nonexistent figure of their own creation--a creation made by the union of several preceding pagan elements that has now been distorted by others and taken as one single person\n 2) writing about a blended persona of several real historical persons all with the name of Jesus\n \n As a similar example, Unicorns were believed to be real in medieval times. It can be debated whether this belief comes from the mythological (such as the Cretan bull in profile fighting the Lion which became the Lion and the Unicorn, as some postulate), from the mythological metaphor, from seeing mixes of bone remains and thinking they were one animal, or from forgers and story-tellers (which abounded). In all probability, these things all occurred together, each reinforcing the other.\n\n What do you make of the following verses in which the gospel writers establish Jesus as the Christ, a single person, and not as one of many Christs:\n \n Matthew 16:13-17  \"Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, 'Who do men say that the Son of man is?' And they said, 'Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.' He said to them, 'But who do say that I am?' Simon Peter replied, 'You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.' And Jesus answered him, 'Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jona! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my FAther who is in heaven.\" \n \n Also, 2 Corinthians 11:4 does not refer to another Jesus that was a magician. This verse is simply an admonition by Paul not to accept an impostor. But if there was to be an impostor or counterfeit than who was going to be counterfeited?",

You can make up rituals as you go, but most wiccans are more scripted than that. As I said, there are common rules (do no harm, three times three, respect the sacred earth), and things which differ between groups.\n\n I made the mistake of believing Mizmaxx was a Wicca. Then she got upset and said she'd told me many times she wasn't. Though I don't recall this, untill the point where she actually got upset.\n But, what she's talking about here, is according to her, not her own beliefs - because she claims not to be Wicca.\n She gets really informative about her beliefs in post #57\n \nWe tend to be more interested in things more terrestrial than extra-terrestrial.\n\n Here is a typical conversation #35 Is Witchcraft a religion? thread\n \nMizmaxx, do you believe in gods? \n\n \nNot in the sense you probably mean.\n\n I was stunned by the amount of information she managed to pack into one sentence. :)\n Then I hit the jack-pot, the mother-lode of information (from the same post)\n \nMy \"gods\" don't require evidence. I do not claim a supernatural yet historical figure of any kind. My \"gods\" are based on worship of the fundamentally sacred- life, love, food, death. Everything I believe is supported by contemporary holistic sciences, from quantum particles and string theory to photosynthesis and reproduction.\n\n But then...post #41\n \nAre you saying 'love' is your god?\n\n \nThat would be an over-simplification.\n\n I suggest you check out the rest of this post as it has more information. Though I don't know how science can test for 'love'. It has something to do with Kreb cycles I believe she says.",
