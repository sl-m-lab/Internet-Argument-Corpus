   "Good articles pointing out how criminals will always obtain by criminal behavior what will be removed from the law abiding by legislative fiat.\n \n \nPOLICE raids and an undercover operation have netted more than 100 illegal firearms\n\n \n \nThat, after 5 or 6 thousand illegal guns were just handed in \n\n \n I keep seeing this reference to \"illegal\" guns. I have several questions about this. Maybe you could clarify your usage of this often repeated, yet strangely undefined term.\n \n 1) What is an \"illegal\" gun? Is this similar to an \"illegal\" stick or an \"illegal\" rock? \n 2) What is the difference between an illegal gun and a legal one? \n 3) Can a criminal own a legal gun, or are all guns owned by criminals \"illegal\" by proxie?\n 4) If this same gun is lawfully owned by a law abiding citizen, it would be a \"legal\" gun, right? Then this means that the gun isn't inherently legal, or illegal, it is the nature of ownership. \n 5) If this gun is an inherently \"illegal\" gun, how can it be owned by a law abiding citizen? Wouldn't this make the citizen a criminal? \n \n Then we're back to square one: A gun owned by a criminal = \"illegal\" gun by proxie. \n \n 6) How did this \"illegal\" gun get made? If it is \"illegal\", it would be illegal to create, right? Then it would be created by criminals. How does one make an \"illegal\" gun legally? \n \n 7) If it was legal to make, it must be a legal gun. At what point does this legal gun become \"illegal\"? \n \n 8) If this legal gun becomes \"illegal\" only upon ownership by a criminal, this would, once again, be the nature of ownership, and not the gun itself that would be the legal issue, correct?\n \n I still can't figure out the difference between the two. Could you provide some clarification?",

While a criminal, (who ignores that very law, hence: criminal) uses it at will.\n \n What a way to die.\n \n It might not be the most wonderful example of living, but hey, at least I'm still living. \n \n BTW: carrying 28 ounces of .45 ACP everywhere I go isn't really that much of a burden.

We had gun control before 1996, kind of like america. No fully automatic but you could still get guns from Kmart or \"Costco\" (As you should be able to mind you)\n \n After 1996 semi automatic long arms were taken away from EVERY law abiding citizen and all those criminals decided against it, cus they wanted to terroriese the defencess. To buy a Semi auto handgun or single shot bolt action rifle you had to to fill out for than 25 pages of govermnet forms TO APPLY FOR A LICENCE TO OWN A GUN. You then have to get a 150kg safe or one that is bolted to the frame of your house. But you had to get another one so you can keep the ammo in it. You then have to wait 28 days or longer for the government to process your form. If they do allow your request you then have to register EVERY firearm you buy with the government to ake it nice and easy for them to seize it when need be. When you finally want to buy a gun you have to wait another 28 days for the goverment to process the forms then you have to register that one with the police again!! You have to PROVE that you shoot it 4 times a year at a registed gun range, 2 as often as cops mind you. You must store the ammo and the gun itself separately. IN YOUR OWN HOME MIND YOU, you must then remove the bolt to make it inoperatble. To use an air rifle on your own property you must have 5 acres of land! lol\n \n After all of this XXXX that law abiding citizens must go though to own a firearm criminal just buy their guns illegally. So you think that more crime = a law is working? More deaths is justifed as long as we get rid of guns in the hands of law abiding citizens? Your ideas make me sick and i hope you do not live in America as you should never be alllowed to destroy Americas freedoms. BTW these laws worked so well that Homicides (which had been declining for many year beforehand) jumped 300% in one year in Victoria. Armed robbery jumped 44% percent nationwide. Today crime is still rising as a result of this disgraceful law. \n \n The exact thing happened in England. Only crime is going up quicker than here, i suppose you think that more crime = gun control works. So well done mate you have successfully killed more police and more innocent people with your incorrect and moronic belives. Hope you sleep well. \n \n You must register every firearm. You must keep them where you cannot use them for self defence (besides you cannot use them for self defence) \n IF you want to get a paintball gun you must go though all of this XXXX just to own a piece of sporting equipment.

I hope you can accept my apoligy and i will try not to \"screw\" up again.\n\n \n In regards to this type of crime it is rightfully called racketerring and conspiracy which takes in crimes such as this of all nature. In our haste to prosecute criminals, specific identification is a flaw to prosecution in most cases. If these crimes are treated like any other crime of this nature it should at least be on the same level as other organized crime no matter if it is dope, sex or whatever. Prosecuting a specifically named right is a bit shady in itself and leaves people with the impression that 'guns are evil' , bad and illegal. That is not the nature of the crime. Just as Bloombergs \"straw purchases\" used undercover cops they should have been prosecuted under the actual law since they engaged \"not in illegal purchases\" since they were legally entitiled to purchase but in INTENT to knowingly entrap someone to push their agenda. That is conspiracy and racketeering. They were not even in their jurisdiction and had no title which is a major factor that even the feds have to establish to get \"a case in the four corners\" for legal requirement to prosecute. When cops start acting shady and operate out of the law you have a real problem with the justice system.\n \n Now the gun grabbers could care less even if it is illegal only if it advances their agenda. We want to protect that image we so anxiously strive to project and point out their illegal tactics and criminal misdeeds. Just like the Frizen case right now where BATF(E) got caught with a predicament where they would have to prove their own books were valid and not cooked and they folded. They should be prosecuted for civil rights violations!\n \n In a gun case, the jury has to decide every factor of punishment and you can't have MANDATORY anything; thanks to rulings like Morrison and Castillo. The agenda of the anti gun crowd is that any victory is not a failure and we don't want to become victims of that fabrication. Like I said, I know your heart is in the right place but make certain the head is too. emoticon_xhoho \n \n No matter, what has changed since Heller is the recognition of an individual right. If the gun grabbers want to treat that right like cars, the people have the right to sell and dispose of their property like any other property...the cops are jealous of the fact that citizens can rightfully take care of themselves and in some self-defense situations go so far as calling the victim a \"vigilante\".

We do not want the American disease imported into Australia\".[44] In a television interview shortly before the tenth anniversary of the Port Arthur massacre, he reaffirmed his stance: \"I did not want Australia to go down the American path. There are some things about America I admire and there are some things I don't. And one of the things I don't admire about America is their... slavish love of guns.

Following the Port Arthur massacre, the Howard Government (1996-2007), with strong media and public support, enforced uniform gun laws on the states. Despite his strong support for the USA on many other issues, former Prime Minister John Howard frequently referred to the USA to explain his opposition to civilian firearms ownership and use in Australia, stating that he did not want Australia to go \"down the American path\".[41][42][43] In one interview on Sydney radio station 2GB he said \"we will find any means we can to further restrict them because I hate guns... ordinary citizens should not have weapons. We do not want the American disease imported into Australia\".[44] In a television interview shortly before the tenth anniversary of the Port Arthur massacre, he reaffirmed his stance: \"I did not want Australia to go down the American path. There are some things about America I admire and there are some things I don't. And one of the things I don't admire about America is their... slavish love of guns. They're evil\".[45] During the same television interview, Prime Minister Howard also stated that he saw the outpouring of grief in the aftermath of the Port Arthur massacre as \"an opportunity to grab the moment and think about a fundamental change to gun laws in this country\".\n \n Arrrrr John howard does believe that any citizen should be able to own guns and using extensive scientific reseach he found out that guns were evil!\n\n \n Little Johnny isn't your Prime minister any more, the Conservatives lost the last election to a man called Kevin Rudd.",

   "However, Sir, if you actually convince me, I will gladly tell the board that you did.\nI'll hold you to that.;)\n \n Self-defence\n In the South Australian Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Howe (1958) SASR 95, Mason J formulated six propositions on the law of self-defence were accepted as a model direction on self-defence in murder trials. Thus, a full acquittal was achieved if the jury found that the accused had reasonably believed they were threatened with death or serious bodily harm and, if so, that the force used was reasonably proportionate to the perceived danger. In Zecevic v Director of Public Prosecutions (Vic) (1987) 162 CLR 645 the victim rented a unit from the defendant. The defendant became increasingly annoyed with the victim who kept leaving the security gates of the unit unlocked. After one heated exchange, the defendant was stabbed by the tenant. The defendant, fearing that the tenant was about to get a gun from his car, rushed off and got his shotgun. The defendant returned, and shot and killed the tenant. The majority of the High Court said at 661:\n \n The question to be asked in the end is quite simple. It is whether the accused believed upon reasonable grounds that it was necessary in self-defence to do what he did. If he had that belief and there were reasonable grounds for it, or if the jury is left in reasonable doubt about the matter, then he is entitled to an acquittal. Stated in this form, the question is one of general application and is not limited to cases of homicide. \n In Conlon (1993) BFW 709 the accused used a shotgun to repel two trespassers whom he believed were stealing his cannabis plants. His belief was affected by drunkenness and a schizoid personality disorder which were relevant to determine whether the Crown had proved that he had not acted in self defence: specifically whether he believed that it was necessary to do what he did and whether that was a reasonable belief. This question seems advantageous to the defence because it tests whether the belief is reasonable to the accused (a subjective test), not reasonable to the reasonable person (objective test).\n \n Under South Australian law, the general defence appears in s15(1) Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA) for defending a person's life, and s15A(1) for defending property, subject to a hybrid test, i.e. the defendant honestly believed the threat to be imminent and made an objectively reasonable and proportionate response to the circumstances as the accused subjectively perceived them.\n \n No 28 of 2003&#8212;Criminal Law Consolidation (Self Defence) Amendment Act 2003 [1] In July 2003, the Rann Government (SA) introduced laws allowing householders to use \"whatever force they deem necessary\" when confronted with a home invader. Householders who kill or injure a home invader escape prosecution provided they can prove they had a genuine belief that it was necessary to do so to protect themselves or their family. The law was strongly opposed by then-Director of Public Prosecutions Paul Rofe, QC, and lawyer Marie Shaw, who is now a District Court Judge. [2]\n \n \n [edit] Excessive self defence\n The rationale of the defence recognises that the degree of culpability normally associated with murder may be missing. In the High Court case of Viro v The Queen (1978) 141 CLR 88 Aickin J said at 180:\n \n [There is] a real distinction in the degree of culpability of an accused who has killed having formed the requisite intention without any mitigating circumstance, and an accused who, in response to a real or a reasonably apprehended attack, strikes a blow in order to defend himself, but uses force beyond that required by the occasion and thereby kills the attacker. \n The defence was first recognised in the common law in R v McKay (1957) VR 560 where a farmer shot and fatally wounded a chicken thief, and confirmed in R v Howe (1958) SASR 95 where Mayo J held at 121-122:\n \n A person who is subjected to a violent and felonious attack and who, in endeavouring, by way of self-defence, to prevent the consummation of that attack by force exercises more force than a reasonable man [sic] would consider necessary in the circumstances, but no more than what he [or she] honestly believed to be necessary in the circumstances, is guilty of manslaughter and not of murder. \n This mitigatory defence was abolished in Zecevic v Director of Public Prosecutions which expressed the view that provocation should be the alternative considered. The defence was re-introduced in statutory form in South Australia in 1991, revised in 1997. The Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA) s15 now reads:\n \n (2) It is a partial defence to a charge of murder (reducing the offence to manslaughter) if: \n (a) the defendant genuinely believed the conduct to which the charge relates to be necessary and reasonable for a defensive purpose; but \n (b) the conduct was not, in the circumstances as the defendant genuinely believed them to be, reasonably proportionate to the threat that the defendant genuinely believed to exist. \n (3) For the purposes of this section, a person acts for a defensive purpose if the person acts: \n (a) in self defence or in defence of another; or \n (b) to prevent or terminate the unlawful imprisonment of himself, herself or another. \n s15A extends the partial defence to circumstances where the accused had applied excessive force in killing the deceased but had genuinely believed the force to be necessary and reasonable:\n \n (i) to protect property from unlawful appropriation, destruction, damage or interference; or \n ii) to prevent criminal trespass to land or premises, or to remove from land or premises a person who is committing a criminal trespass; or \n (iii) to make or assist in the lawful arrest of an offender or alleged offender or a person who is unlawfully at large; and the defendant did not intend to cause death (emphasis added). \n In 2002, New South Wales reintroduced excessive self defence as s421 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Section 421 states:\n \n (a) the person uses force that involves the intentional or reckless infliction of death, and \n (b) the conduct is not a reasonable response in the circumstances as he or she perceives them, but the person believes the conduct is necessary: \n (c) to defend himself or herself or another person, or \n (d) to prevent or terminate the unlawful deprivation of his or her liberty or the liberty of another person. \n (2) The person is not criminally responsible for murder but, on a trial for murder, the person is to be found guilty of manslaughter if the person is otherwise criminally responsible for manslaughter.\n \n Unlike South Australian law, s420 of the NSW Crimes Act explicitly states that self-defence is not available as a defence to murder if death is inflicted to prevent criminal trespass.\n \n In November 2005, pursuant to recommendations from the Law Reform Commission for Victoria, the Victorian legislature introduced new laws regarding self defence. Among them, a new offence of defensive homicide was created: where the accused's belief in the need for the force applied in self-defence was unreasonable, s/he may be convicted of an offence less serious than murder.\n \n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-defence_(Australia))",

   "I want to say this before I start. Australia does not need me or anyone else to correct their system. That is between the Australian People and God. Your system has nothing to do with me or anyone here. You are free to do as you wish. \n \n First, fix your link because it is broken. I would like to look at his or their references. I dislike using Wikipedia because anyone can go in and change it to anything they want. \n \n If your source is correct, it does look like they passed the legislation I linked. \n \n Remarkably absent in your quoted page, was the word firearm anywhere, as that is the issue in question. You say it means firearm, but also say you are not in any way that familiar with Australian law. So we don't really know. So what am I to conclude? \n \n As I read and understand this theory of Self Defense is dependent upon a ton of circumstances being in your favor. There were a Ton of words that had to do with the proper amount of force necessary (to repel the invader). That, unfortunately is to be determined by people who are not there, and by people who's lives were not threatened. \n \n We dealt with that crappy wording here in Ohio, and it was being applied by some who absolutely hated guns, and we found it to be too subjective. One was guilty till prover innocent. \n \n Does the Firearm qualify? Maybe? I don't know. Who can say from what we read. But there again, likely not! Leaving one to need to have a lawyer advising one at all times as to the legality of requisite amount of force that some court will find was necessary. \n \n Here in Ohio, with a similarly worded law, we had a duty to retreat, leaving the thug the Absolute Right to do whatever they want while one called the Cops. If you live in a big city like Cleveland, that meant they had a minimum of 30 minutes with a possibility of an hour, maybe longer, to do whatever they wanted. \n \n Although I could leave my bedroom or some other designated retreat area and try to protect my stuff, but if he started swinging or pulled an offensive weapon, back into the designated retreat area. We had courts who said, that if he followed you into your retreat area where I must go by law. You were required to leave the house in some court decisions. That is not much of a Right of Self Defense is it? It is up to a court to decide if you acted up to their standards. \n \n All of this is why I ask the questions I did. What you showed me, is about the same as what we had before we got that law changed to the Castle doctrine, where the burden of proof in now on the prosecutor who must now prove you were not threatened, and therefore not in fear for your life. \n \n In other words innocent till proven guilty. \n \n I would like to see deadly force with a firearm spelled out before I will go along with the idea that it is legal to use a firearm for self defense. That from personal experience with Ohio's similarly worded laws. But with one over riding difference, we are allowed to have a firearm for self defense and it was specifically laid out in the law. \n \n From what I read, it is likely that it will be up to your lawyer and a jury to prove you are innocent instead of a prosecutor having to prove your guilt. Again, that is not much of a right.\n \n Like Doc wrote.\n \nConcealed carry? NO!\n Castle Law NO\n Constitutional right NO\n No Bans on common\n guns and semis YES\n Gun Confiscations YES\n Must be locked up YES\n More restrictions\n coming YES\n At least 75% of\n homes with guns NO\n Militia clause NO\n Preamble and BOR NO\n",

   "Well now we have returned to a topic that I claim to have some knowledge about. \n \n Nozza, I read earlier that you wished to know more about the laws over on this side of the pond. I don&#8217;t claim to know the laws of other states, but here at least is an outline of the law of self defense in my state, which follows the common law we inherited from England: \n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/gun-control-debates/4779-natural-right-self-defense-use-deadly-force-virginia.html\n \n Notice the common law rules for self defense which apply in my state do not mention the use of firearms. The law draws a distinction only between &#8220;deadly&#8221; and &#8220;non-deadly&#8221; weapons. The definition of what constitutes a &#8220;deadly&#8221; weapon is quite broad (from a Virginia jury instruction):\n \n &#8220;Any object or instrument, not part of the human body, that is likely to cause death or great bodily injury because of the manner and under the circumstances in which it is used.&#8221;\n \n This is merely a reflection of common sense. Many objects (bricks, bats, knives, pipes, firearms, etc.) can become deadly weapons depending on how they are used. Regardless of whether a person uses a firearm, a knife, or some other &#8220;deadly weapon,&#8221; the use of deadly force in self defense is permitted only in response to an attack involving the threat of deadly force (from another jury instruction): \n \n THE COURT INSTRUCTS THE JURY THAT the amount of force used in self-defense must be reasonable in relation to the harm threatened, and that the defendant is not allowed to use deadly force in self-defense unless he reasonably feared, under the circumstances as they appeared to him, that he was in danger of being killed or that he was in danger of great bodily harm.\n \n In Virginia, although firearms are not specifically mentioned, you may always use a firearm to defend yourself when your attacker places you &#8220;in danger of being killed&#8221; or &#8220;in danger of great bodily harm.&#8221; In other words, there is no equating of weapons when deadly force is concerned&#8212;you are not limited to using only the same type of deadly weapon or one someone might consider &#8220;less lethal&#8221; than the one your attacker uses. Once you are threatened with any deadly weapon, then you may use any deadly weapon at hand&#8212;including a firearm&#8212;to defend yourself. If you attacker chooses, for example, to bring a knife to a gunfight, then too bad for him. \n \n Having said this, however, the law of self-defense remains the law of necessity, and it does not extend to become a right of retaliation or revenge. I am often asked how many times can you shoot someone in self-defense. The answer is however many times it takes for the attack to stop. But once the attack stops, your use of force in self-defense must also stop. If, for example, you shoot a knife-wielding attacker and he falls to the ground, you can&#8217;t walk up to him, tell him &#8220;you tried to rob the wrong guy,&#8221; and then empty your gun into him.\n \n (Note also, to the surprise and chagrin of many, that my state does not permit using even the mere threat of deadly force solely to defend property. For example, the law does not permit you to come out of a store and pull out your concealed handgun and point it at the guy breaking into your car to run him off. Legally, this would be a crime called brandishing a firearm)\n \n Sinjin, assuming your summary of Australian law is correct, then I see little to distinguish the law of self defense in that nation from the law of self-defense in my state where firearms are concerned. \n \n Now let me explain how I deal with killings that are claimed to be in self-defense. When law enforcement shows up at a death scene they start an investigation with some variation of these basic facts: A man lays dead and your prints all over the gun that killed him. Self-defense claims are generally made very early. In the majority of cases the &#8220;suspect&#8221; in the killing wants to immediately tell his story of why he felt compelled to act in self defense&#8212;and so we generally end up with a detailed explanation which can be compared to the facts developed in the investigation. \n \n The first question I ask is this: Assuming everything the person says is true, does what he has said fit the legal definition of legitimate self-defense? Take, for example, this claim: &#8220;I shot the neighbor&#8217;s 5 year old son because he was threatening to swat me with a willow switch.&#8221; Even if true this explanation does not establish a legitimate claim of using reasonable force in self-defense. \n \n The next&#8212;and what almost always becomes the most important&#8212;question is this: Do you believe the person is telling the truth? This question is usually answered by comparing what the person says against what the facts show. I have reviewed both lethal and non-lethal self-defense claims before and found many to be justified. There are others which I have felt were either unjustified or fraudulently made. An example of one such case where I did not believe the self-defense claim is here: \n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/gun-control-debates/12229-question-anti-gun-self-image-12.html#post342956\n \n Regardless of how a self-defense &#8220;right&#8221; is written or recognized, however, my burden of proving that the person did not act in legitimate self-defense&#8212;and that he instead committed a crime&#8212;always remains the same (from the Virginia model jury instruction):\n \n The defendant is presumed to be innocent. You should not assume the defendant is guilty because he has been indicted and is on trial. This presumption of innocence remains with the defendant throughout the trial and is enough to require you to find the defendant not guilty unless and until the Commonwealth proves each and every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. This does not require proof beyond all possible doubt, nor is the Commonwealth required to disprove every conceivable circumstance of innocence. However, suspicion or probability of guilt is not enough for a conviction. There is no burden on the defendant to produce any evidence. A reasonable doubt is a doubt based on your sound judgment after a full and impartial consideration of all the evidence in the case.\n \n Two final things I will quote regarding prosecuting crimes where self-defense is the claimed justification (although they apply for every prosecution of every crime, regardless of the circumstances). I refer to these as the &#8220;sleep test.&#8221; That is, if you follow these principles then you will have no trouble being able to sleep on what you have done. In my opinion prosecutors get themselves into trouble when they allow the temptation of winning to cloud these principles when engaged in the adversarial trial process: \n \n \"A prosecutor has the responsibility of a minister of justice and not simply that of an advocate. This responsibility carries with it specific obligations to see that the defendant is accorded procedural justice and that guilt is decided on the basis of sufficient evidence.\" (comment on Rule 3.8 of the Virginia Rules on Professional Conduct)\n \n \"[A prosecutor] is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done. \" Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88 (1935)\n \n Nozza, I do not know this, but it is my hope that prosecutors in your nation are bound by similar ethical rules.",

Legally we are NOT ALLOWED to use a firearm for self defence however you MAY once in a blue moon get away with it. \n \n Last night we had two fatal shootings occur that could have been prevented with a firearm and a home invasion that killed 5 persons a few weeks back that once again could have been prevented with legal ownership of firearms in law abiding hands. In fact Aussie olymic legend Dawn Fraiser was attacked in her daughters house just 40km away from us last week and it only took police 45 minutes to arrive on the scene. (this is not out in the middle of nowhere this is in a CITY!!!! ) Thank god our police will be there to protect us hey anti gun nutters.\n \n The artical shooters find a friend in labour is one of the most shockinly one sided loads of bull**** i have ever read and i apoligise to anybody who had to suffer reading that. \n \n Shooters find a friend in Labor | The Daily Telegraph\n \n \n Here is a quote from it:\n \n Children need responsible role models to learn how to behave in a lawful society.

Since he has a gun while doing this the only method of action must be to allow him to do it as anti gun groups keep telling us this is fact. \n \n Sinjin a man is illegally on your property in your backgarden, chances are he is not there to sing Christmas Carols.

However if you do it, there is a great likelihood you will end up face down on the pavement with a gun pointed at you, just because the police do not like that it is legal and it is our Right, and they want to bully us out of our rights. \n \n Just recently Cleveland decided to bully one of its law-abiding citizens, who incidentally had a copy of the Ohio AG's memo with him, just because he had the audacity to do what the law and the Ohio Constitution says he had the absolute right to do. They had him in jail, until bail could be arranged. They set a court date, and miraculously found reason after reason to delay it, just to cause this A Hole who actually DARED to Believe that He Could Actually Follow Ohio's Laws and Ohio's Constitution and participate in this right, and they wanted to cost him just as much money in lawyer fees as they possibly could! Cleveland finally had to drop the case, for obvious reasons,```` because We the People of Ohioans for Concealed Carry stepped in and provided him the lawyer free of charge. emoticon_smile \n \n In other words BULLY THIS Cleveland! \n \n However, we are used to this kind of abuse here in Ohio. Ohio was as anti-gun, as California is, in the 80's and early 90's until a very small organization who met in someone's basement printed out filers and distributed them around the state, finally gathering 100,000 members and changed Ohio politics forever. \n \n We get bullied out of our Rights all of the time, by bureaucracies, to include an issue recently carrying concealed at rest stops. Honestly it never stops. Just because the law says something, to include Supreme Courts, does not mean that you actually have that Right. Most of the time you have to fight for it, and that takes Bucks. One person can't do it alone. At Ohioans for concealed carry, we know one thing for a fact. Just because a legislature and even a Supreme Court, says you have a right, doesn't mean you actually have one, until you fight every possible bureaucracy in the state. \n \n Mayors, police departments, and many government employees are sometimes on a power trip, and they believe that you only have the rights that they graciously decide to grant you, despite what some insignificant legislature or supreme court says! And even that, on a case by case bases. Peh, Who are they? \n \n We have to fight for every right that the Legislature passes when it comes to firearms, and that takes bucks, and it could possibly cost the Firearm freedom of everyone who runs into one of these pompous Butt Holes!",

   "The following is a purely self-indulgent digression into a topic which, although raised here, has nothing to do with gun control...\n \n ***\n \n Well now I am an American but I favor British authorship in recording the history of WWII. John Keegan is a particularly valuable military historian, but I consider B. H. Liddell Hart the best WWII historian-and I highly recommend his book \"History of Second World War.\" \n I remember he prefaced his work by stating that the Western Powers (France and England) entered WWII with two goals. He said the immediate purpose was to fulfill the pledge of preserving Poland's independence, while the longer term goal was to remove a potential military menace to their East and thereby ensure their greater security. He said France and England ultimately failed to reach either goal. They proved powerless to prevent Poland from being overrun and divided by Germany and Russia in the beginning. And, after years of war which crushed Nazi Germany they were forced to acquiesce to Poland's domination by a Russia-thereby abandoning their pledge to the Poles that brought them into the war in the first place. And, of course, the result of their \"victory\" over Germany left both nations weakened and facing a much greater threat to the East-which led them in turn to become dependents of America. But enough from me on the history of WWII in a GC forum. \n \n ***\n \n Now back to the forum's topic....\n \n No offense taken, Tither. By the way, just where has Brady gone to hide? We haven't seen him in quite some time....\n \n I don't know what the law of self-defense is in Australia, and this is why I prefaced what I said with \"assuming what has been presented is correct\"-and if Sinjin's summary is correct then my opinion of the similarity between Australian self-defense law and Virginia's remains unchanged.\n Let me address for a moment the first case scenario cited by Sinjin:\n \n \"After one heated exchange, the defendant was stabbed by the tenant. The defendant, fearing that the tenant was about to get a gun from his car, rushed off and got his shotgun. The defendant returned, and shot and killed the tenant.\" (bold emphasis added)\n \n I have no idea why this case was prosecuted, but if I had to guess then my opinion is the decision to prosecute was in large part based upon what I highlighted. Virginia, for example, does not require a \"retreat to the wall\" before you may exercise the right of self-defense (assuming the \"defendant\" did not provoke the confrontation to start with, in which case different rules apply). But even in Virginia the law of self-defense does not permit a person to leave a violent scene, arm themselves, and then return to reinitiate the confrontation while better armed. And so, technically, this fact scenario does not fit well within the law of self-defense, and if Australian self defense law is indeed similar then the prosecutor could have used this line of reasoning to decide to prosecute. \n \n But in Virginia at least the crime, if any, would not be murder. It would in my opinion be at best manslaughter, which is a lesser degree of homicide-being an intentional killing not justified by the law of self-defense but done without malice and while under the heat of passion as a reaction to an extreme provocation. \n \n And yet all of this remains just speculation, for we do not know whether there were any other facts involved in the case. Suppose, for example, that when \"defendant\" went to get his shotgun he tells someone \"That guy just stabbed me! Give me my gun so I can go back and kill that @#%#*!\" The balance of the prosecute/don't prosecute scales move back and forth on such facts-and as I said I don't know if anything else was known or went into the equation.\n \n I can see how a government policy of denying gun ownership for the purpose of self-defense could co-exist with a right of self-defense which allows you to use a gun for self-defense if you are fortunate enough to have one at hand because you justified having it for another purpose. I just think the two should not co-exist this side of the looking glass. To me it runs contrary to the common sense of mankind for a government official to say you can't have an otherwise lawful product for a purpose which I admit is not only lawful but is also one I am charged with protecting as an individual right. Such a policy may be expected to be a topic of discussion at the table of the Mad Hatter, but it should have no place at the seat of a responsible government. \n \n I for one believe that a government which claims to derive its authority from the trust given to it by its citizens should not be afraid to trust its citizens in return with firearms for the purpose of self-defense.\n \n Nozza, if this unfortunate policy is the path chosen by your government then I advise you take up duck hunting and beg the permission of the government to possess and hunt with (in my opinion) the ultimate home defense weapon-the Remington 870 12ga. pump shotgun. \n \n Now for another question that is unanswered: What accountability do Australian prosecutors have to the public? Are they appointed or elected? In Virginia the head prosecutor for each jurisdiction is elected-thereby making him or her accountable to the public every 4 years. This is an important issue in Virginia because prosecutors are vested with wide discretion-including the sole authority to determine whether to seek capital punishment. \n \n It has often been said \"we are a government of laws and not men\"-but we need good, honest men and women to enforce the laws and make good choices when presented with difficult facts. If what both Sinjin and Nozza have posted is true (and I have no reason to doubt either of them), then the inconsistency in what they both say can only be resolved by considering it to be the failure of the keepers of the justice system to uphold their oaths. This is why I posted my \"sleep test\"-for whether in Virginia, Australia, or (for Tither's sake) Ohio, the wording of the law means nothing unless men and women take their oaths to protect and defend the rule of law seriously.",

   "Some civilized societies have concluded that this is akin to pouring gasoline on a fire.

Like me. \n \n Friends of mine at a World Cup game in Europe were chanting \"USA, USA\". \n People nearby pleaded with them, \"No violence, John Wayne, no violence\", genuinely threatened. \n Too funny.\n\n \n Umm which civilized societies would this be? England? One of the most crime ridden hell holes on earth? Austalia where crime continues to soar? NY and Washinton DC with their Draconian gun laws forcing the law abiding to become scared of stepping outside? 1940s Germany perhaps? Or North Korea?

   "In Australia i can get a gun to shoot at Clay pidgeons or to shoot at small pieces of white paper or a wild pig. However I cannot get a gun legally to shoot the criminal trying to kill my family or myself. I cannot legally own a firearm to shoot a criminal trying to attack another fellow human as I must wait the 35 minutes for the cops to arrive. This is SHAMEFUL. \n \n Sinjin I hope you have some evidence to back up your claim that The REST OF THE WORLD views Americans as a bunch of \"buckaroos\" I definitley do not view America as \"buckaroos\" since I want to move there. \n \n Thank god for the 2nd Amendment:\n \n \"Someone at the table asked a Japanese admiral why, with the Pacific Fleet devastated at Pearl Harbor and the mainland U.S. forces in what Japan had to know was a pathetic state of unreadiness, Japan had not simply invaded the West Coast.\n Commander Menard would never forget the crafty look on the Japanese commander's face as he frankly answered the question.\n 'You are right,' he told the Americans. 'We did indeed know much about your preparedness. We knew that probably every second home in your country contained firearms. We knew that your country actually had state championships for private citizens shooting military rifles. We were not fools to set foot in such quicksand.\" \n \n For without it you boys would have been in trouble!\n \n The question of self defence in my mind is VERY simple.

   "The following is a purely self-indulgent digression into a topic which, although raised here, has nothing to do with gun control...\n \n ***\n \n Well now I am an American but I favor British authorship in recording the history of WWII. John Keegan is a particularly valuable military historian, but I consider B. H. Liddell Hart the best WWII historian-and I highly recommend his book \"History of Second World War.\" \n I remember he prefaced his work by stating that the Western Powers (France and England) entered WWII with two goals. He said the immediate purpose was to fulfill the pledge of preserving Poland's independence, while the longer term goal was to remove a potential military menace to their East and thereby ensure their greater security. He said France and England ultimately failed to reach either goal. They proved powerless to prevent Poland from being overrun and divided by Germany and Russia in the beginning. And, after years of war which crushed Nazi Germany they were forced to acquiesce to Poland's domination by a Russia-thereby abandoning their pledge to the Poles that brought them into the war in the first place. And, of course, the result of their \"victory\" over Germany left both nations weakened and facing a much greater threat to the East-which led them in turn to become dependents of America. But enough from me on the history of WWII in a GC forum. \n \n ***\n \n .\n\n \n I learned at a young age to look at both sides of the coin viz a viz history. Some wise person once said that history books are written by the victors. My mother was Canadian and had her old school books. As a young lad I learned to love to read. Reading the Canadian version of the war of 1812 and then our own didn't make sense to me. They were just about opposite in views. We claimed victory and they claimed victory. Yet we retreated. A cheap novel once held an imortal line. Victory is the possession of good blood soaked earth! Hence the Brits actually won in Canada since we were repelled in our invasion attempt. If any thing one needs to look at the history as written by the losing side even if it loses some thing in translation. \n \n My apologies to Mr NATO for again wandering off topic. ",

   "Australia\n In the criminal law of Australia, self-defense may be a complete defense to criminal liability for causing injury in defense of the person or, to a limited extent, property, or a partial defense to murder if the degree of force used was excessive.\n \n In the South Australian Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Howe (1958) SASR 95, Mason J formulated six propositions on the law of self-defense which were accepted as a model direction on self-defense in murder trials. Thus, a full acquittal was achieved if the jury found that the accused had reasonably believed that he or she was being threatened with death or serious bodily harm and, if so, that the force used was reasonably proportionate to the perceived danger.\n \n \n Excessive defense\n The rationale of the defense recognizes that the degree of culpability normally associated with murder may be missing. In the High Court case of Viro v The Queen (1978) 141 CLR 88 Aickin J said at 180:\n \n [There is] a real distinction in the degree of culpability of an accused who has killed having formed the requisite intention without any mitigating circumstance, and an accused who, in response to a real or a reasonably apprehended attack, strikes a blow in order to defend himself, but uses force beyond that required by the occasion and thereby kills the attacker.",

   "\"As reported, Australian Clinton Brilley was out on bail for armed robbery when he broke into a sports club to commit robbery. A security guard, David Bingle, was on duty when Brilley used a crow bar to break in and threaten his life. Bingle fired in self defense, in fear of Brilley and his carload full of accomplices. Unfortunately for Bingle, a bullet struck Briley in the back, and Briley (who is currently in jail for another armed robbery) is suing. In 2007, the court awarded the armed robber $185,000AU but on appeal the verdict was thrown out, and a new trial is underway. This situation is unjust, plain and simple.\n \n First, it is wrong for the court to second guess whether the security guard acted properly in defense of his life, as he faced multiple armed criminals. Armed robbery is a stressful and deadly situation, where split second decisions can determine whether the victim lives or is killed by the criminal. As such, the victim's decisions should be shown a great deal of deference by judges, jurors, and others who review such decisions from the safety of a court room. Also criminals may pretend that they are leaving, only to return seconds later and resume the attack. I would also add that during the course of an attack, the criminal may end up temporarily facing away from the victim as they maneuver around obstacles, temporarily take cover, and otherwise continue attacking. In sum, while a robbery victim would not be justified in hunting down a criminal days later, I don't think the fact that the bullet entered the criminal's back here means that the victim was in the wrong. The fact that this case even went to trial sends the wrong message to citizens, who may now hesitate in a way that costs them their lives, out of fear that the criminal will be able to sue them later.\n \n Secondly, I would like to say that even if, just for the sake of argument, the security guard used excessive force, the robber should not be able to win money damage. A person who has broken the law for their own gain should not then be able to use the law in order to extract money from the very person they were victimizing. This is not just my opinion, but a longstanding legal doctrine - which I think should apply in this case.\"",

   "Client a 'victim' in police attack\n Melanie Pilling | December 13th, 2007\n \n \n TRAFFIC cop Gabe Jose lost teeth and received shocking facial injuries in a brutal attack on the side of the M1 -- but it is one of his attackers that is the victim, a court has been told.\n \n Tatum Clare Spann, 25, pleaded guilty to serious assault by obstructing the police officer -- disposing of his capsicum spray and wrestling a police baton from him -- while he was defending himself from a frenzied attack by Kelvin Luke Cardwell.\n \n But during her sentencing hearing in Southport District Court yesterday, her barrister, Craig Eberhardt, argued that Spann was a victim and had acted courageously during the attack.\n \n \"She acted with courage and restraint in a very difficult and trying situation,\" said Mr Eberhardt.\n \n \"She was confronted by a scene of disturbing violence within metres of speeding traffic ... she did not know what to do.\n \n \"At no stage was she physically involved at all.\n \n \"Her intervention (in taking the baton) was inappropriate ... (but) she showed admirable courage as a young woman alone on the side of the highway attempting to intervene in the circumstances.\n \n \"Albeit that she made the wrong decision.\"\n \n He said Spann was trying to protect Cardwell, 27, from being injured when she took the baton.\n \n Mr Eberhardt said Spann had been humiliated by police and the media since her arrest, which should be mitigating factors in her sentencing.\n \n He argued police treatment of her was 'incomprehensible' and alleged she was handcuffed without being arrested, not given access to a solicitor, was not given pain relief to wounds to her upper thigh and that those wounds were photographed by a male police officer.\n \n He added that those injuries -- sustained when Sen-Constable Jose fired a single defensive shot at Cardwell that ended up lodged in Spann's leg -- were 'embarrassing ... ugly and painful wounds' that the court should also consider when sentencing her.\n \n \"The experience was humiliating, degrading and extremely distressing for her,\" said Mr Eberhardt. \"(The police) showed callous disregard for her injuries ... and human dignity.\"\n \n He also criticised the media, in particular The Gold Coast Bulletin for exaggerating the facts and suggested the police had 'tipped off' the media upon Spann's release from hospital when she was photographed handcuffed and in prison browns 'looking dishevelled'.\n \n \"The media have aggravated a negative public view of Ms Spann,\" he said.\n \n Sen-Constable Jose is still recovering from the injuries he received in the attack on June 24 last year when he was working on a special traffic operation on the M1 at Pimpama.\n \n He had pulled over a Ford Falcon that had made a sudden swerve and then stopped on the side of the busy roadway.\n \n Three people were in the car -- Cardwell, Spann and another woman.\n \n After checking their details he found Cardwell had given him a false name and arrested him.\n \n But as Sen-Constable Jose was trying to handcuff Cardwell he broke free and repeatedly punched the officer in the face.\n \n The pair struggled before Cardwell gouged at Sen-Constable Jose's eyes, who could see his capsicum spray on the ground 'not far from his reach' .\n \n \"He then saw Spann kick the spray away from his reach,\" said Crown prosecutor Mark Whitbread.\n \n Spann threw the capsicum spray over a concrete barrier.\n \n Mr Eberhardt said that was because she did not want either man to get hold of it.\n \n \"She thought about getting the (capsicum) spray and spraying both of them,\" he said.\n \n \"She decided the better thing to do with it was put it over the railing.\"\n \n Cardwell then grabbed Sen-Constable Jose by the head and bit him numerous times.\n \n Mr Whitbread said Cardwell was growling like an animal as he bit.\n \n \"He recalls seeing flesh in between Cardwell's jaws,\" said Mr Whitbread.\n \n Cardwell then tried grabbing for Sen-Constable Jose's firearm but could not get it out of the holster.\n \n \"Nearby, watching all of this was Spann,\" said Mr Whitbread.\n \n But Spann claims not to have seen it.\n \n \"She was unaware that he had been bitten or that Cardwell had attempted to get his gun,\" said Mr Eberhardt. \"She did not know he was faring as badly as he was.\n \n \"She was concerned that Mr Cardwell would be seriously injured.\" \n \n Somehow Sen-Constable Jose got to his feet and struck Cardwell with his baton but as he was raising his arm to inflict another blow, Spann wrestled the baton from his hands.\n \n He asked her to let go but she refused saying 'No, you will hit him (Cardwell)'.\n \n Cardwell then encouraged her to hit Sen-Constable Jose with the baton.\n \n She did not.\n \n \"And that is to her credit,\" said Mr Eberhardt.\n \n Cardwell then delivered the final blow to Sen-Constable Jose's face -- possibly with his own baton -- knocking out his teeth.\n \n Mr Eberhardt said Spann did not give the baton to Cardwell, he grabbed it from her.\n \n Spann was on bail at the time of the assault and had taken amphetamines that night.\n \n Her six-page criminal history was tendered to the court.\n \n Mr Whitbread described it as a violent and life-threatening attack and called for a head sentence of six years.\n \n Spann has spent almost 18 months in custody.\n \n She will be sentenced by Judge John Newton tomorrow.\n \n Cardwell will be sentenced on April 7.\n \n He has pleaded guilty to committing a malicious act with intent.",

   "Section 222. \"Assault\", definition of \n A person who strikes, touches, or moves, or otherwise applies force of any kind to the person of another, either directly or indirectly, without his consent, or with his consent if the consent is obtained by fraud, or who by any bodily act or gesture attempts or threatens to apply force of any kind to the person of another without his consent, under such circumstances that the person making the attempt or threat has actually or apparently a present ability to effect his purpose, is said to assault that other person, and the act is called an assault. \n The term \"applies force\" includes the case of applying heat, light, electrical force, gas, odour, or any other substance or thing whatever if applied in such a degree as to cause injury or personal discomfort. \n Section 223. Assaults unlawful \n An assault is unlawful and constitutes an offence unless it is authorised or justified or excused by law. \n The application of force by one person to the person of another may be unlawful, although it is done with the consent of that other person. \n \n Section 248. Self-defence against unprovoked assault \n When a person is unlawfully assaulted, and has not provoked the assault, it is lawful for him to use such force to the assailant as is reasonably necessary to make effectual defence against the assault, provided that the force used is not intended, and is not such as is likely, to cause death or grievous bodily harm. If the nature of the assault is such as to cause reasonable apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm, and the person using force by way of defence believes, on reasonable grounds, that he cannot otherwise preserve the person defended from death or grievous bodily harm, it is lawful for him to use any such force to the assailant as is necessary for defence, even though such force may cause death or grievous bodily harm. \n Section 249. Self-defence against provoked assault \n When a person has unlawfully assaulted another or has provoked an assault from another, and that other assaults him with such violence as to cause reasonable apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm, and to induce him to believe, on reasonable grounds, that it is necessary for his preservation from death or grievous bodily harm to use force in self-defence, he is not criminally responsible for using any such force as is reasonably necessary for such preservation, although such force may cause death or grievous bodily harm. \n This protection does not extend to a case in which the person using force which causes death or grievous bodily harm first began the assault with intent to kill or to do grievous bodily harm to some person; nor to a case in which the person using force which causes death or grievous bodily harm endeavoured to kill or to do grievous bodily harm to some person before the necessity of so preserving himself arose; nor, in either case, unless, before such necessity arose, the person using such force declined further conflict, and quitted it or retreated from it as far as was practicable. \n Section 250. Aiding in self-defence \n In any case in which it is lawful for any person to use force of any degree for the purpose of defending himself against an assault, it is lawful for any other person acting in good faith in his aid to use a like degree of force for the purpose of defending such first-mentioned person. \n \n Section 260.

Assaults unlawful \n An assault is unlawful and constitutes an offence unless it is authorised or justified or excused by law. \n The application of force by one person to the person of another may be unlawful, although it is done with the consent of that other person. \n \n Section 248. Self-defence against unprovoked assault \n When a person is unlawfully assaulted, and has not provoked the assault, it is lawful for him to use such force to the assailant as is reasonably necessary to make effectual defence against the assault, provided that the force used is not intended, and is not such as is likely, to cause death or grievous bodily harm. If the nature of the assault is such as to cause reasonable apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm, and the person using force by way of defence believes, on reasonable grounds, that he cannot otherwise preserve the person defended from death or grievous bodily harm, it is lawful for him to use any such force to the assailant as is necessary for defence, even though such force may cause death or grievous bodily harm. \n Section 249. Self-defence against provoked assault \n When a person has unlawfully assaulted another or has provoked an assault from another, and that other assaults him with such violence as to cause reasonable apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm, and to induce him to believe, on reasonable grounds, that it is necessary for his preservation from death or grievous bodily harm to use force in self-defence, he is not criminally responsible for using any such force as is reasonably necessary for such preservation, although such force may cause death or grievous bodily harm. \n This protection does not extend to a case in which the person using force which causes death or grievous bodily harm first began the assault with intent to kill or to do grievous bodily harm to some person; nor to a case in which the person using force which causes death or grievous bodily harm endeavoured to kill or to do grievous bodily harm to some person before the necessity of so preserving himself arose; nor, in either case, unless, before such necessity arose, the person using such force declined further conflict, and quitted it or retreated from it as far as was practicable. \n Section 250.

You could only use equal force.\n \n Ok time for an Aussie to weigh in on an Aussie debate.\n \n 1st point: The criminals broke in and tied up the citizens and took their guns. It is Australian law for EVERY firearm to be kept in either a 150kg safe or a safe that is bolted to the frame of the house. \n \n 1st point answer: This is STUPID. It completely prevents use of firearms for protection and security!\n \n 2nd: Every gun must be unloaded and bolt taken out. Ammo stored in a separate case. \n \n 2nd Point answer: Once again you cannot defend yourself with a gun with no bolt or ammo as the criminal may just notice. Even so you cannot point an unloaded gun at anybody anyway.\n \n 3rd: No law abiding citizen can ever use a firearm to defend their life, their familys or loved ones lives, their properties or for that matter anybody else. If you do so you are charged with murder. \n \n 3rd point answer: YES how good is this, they can kill you, you cannot kill them!!!! No self defence, meaning you have to hold up the criminal for 35 minutes while the police come to help you. \n \n 4th: When defending yourself in Australia you must use equal force. THis means you must use the SAME weapon as the criminal. So no baseball bat V knife. Once you locate the same weapon as the armed criminal has you must then use Reasonable force to bring him down. This means you are NOT allowed to kill him and once he is down you are not allowed to touch him again. Now if you have 2 criminals both with different weapons you must use the weapon one has on that one then change for the other. The catch 22 is if he has a gun you are screwed as using any weapon to defend yourself is ILLEGAL.\n \n 4th point anwer: This is insane, you are giving all the power to the criminal and you are trusting an INCOMPITENT and criminal goverment with your porection\n \n 5th: Criminals will always get guns becasue:::: I have got this incredible information which we simply must publish: Criminals do not obey by the laws!! They will get guns any way they can BECAUSE THEY ARE CRIMINALS. \n \n 5th answer: wow who would have tthought hey, criminals do not obey the law, so lets STOP THEM IN THEIR TRACKS!",

   "Well I don't claim to be an expert on Aussie law, but I do understand the subset of the English language referred to as \"legalese.\" So let me again try to call it like I see it....\n \n \n When a person has unlawfully assaulted another or has provoked an assault from another, and that other assaults him with such violence as to cause reasonable apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm, and to induce him to believe, on reasonable grounds, that it is necessary for his preservation from death or grievous bodily harm to use force in self-defence, he is not criminally responsible for using any such force as is reasonably necessary for such preservation, although such force may cause death or grievous bodily harm. \n\n \n To me this merely restates the common law of deadly force-that deadly force may be used only in response to a threat of death or great bodily harm. This tracks the well with the law of my state. Additionally, the language Sarge highlighted \"for using any such force as is reasonably necessary for such preservation\" is merely a re-statement that the law of self-defense is the law of necessity and not retaliation-that your right of self-defense ends when it no longer becomes necessary to use force to defend yourself. \n \n Say, for example, you shoot the knife wielding would-be robber and he falls to the ground dropping his knife. So far so good. Now his motive may have only been to get your money, but he chose to threaten you with death or great bodily harm to get it. This authorized you to use deadly force to end the threat. And if while lying on the ground he complains about the case of lead poising you just gave him then you can say \"if you're going to be stupid then you've got to be tough, and you were the dumb a$$ who thought it was a great idea to bring a knife to a gunfight.\" Again, so far so good. But if after saying this you walk up to him and shoot him again while he lies unarmed and unable to threaten you further-well then you are no longer using such force \"reasonably necessary\" for \"preservation\" of your life, and you would have crossed the legal line from legitimate self-defense to a criminal act motivated by anger/hatred/revenge, etc. This is the law of my state, and this is how I read the above language presented to us as the law of Oz. \n \n \n Section 250. Aiding in self-defence \n In any case in which it is lawful for any person to use force of any degree for the purpose of defending himself against an assault, it is lawful for any other person acting in good faith in his aid to use a like degree of force for the purpose of defending such first-mentioned person. \n\n \n The heading provides the clue to what this legal clip is speaking about-Aiding in self-defense. In Virginia we call this \"defense of others.\" In a nutshell it means this: If I am attacked and a good Samaritan tried to come to my defense, then he is entitled to use the same level of force to defend me that I could have lawfully used to defend myself. This is the law of defense of others in Virginia, and this is also how I read this language presented to us again as the law of Oz. \n \n Now if some fool in law enforcement in Oz has really decided to interpret this to mean you can only use a like or some less powerful weapon than those used by your attacker, then I invite them to come back to this side of the looking glass, put down the pipe, and surrender this absurd notion. I mean really, for an anti-gunner to read it this way is counterproductive, for that interpretation only serves the ridiculous purpose of encouraging people to go around armed like Mel Gibson's \"Mad Max\" character-armed to the teeth with every conceivable weapon so you could be ready to fight knife for knife, bat for bat, revolver for revolver, etc. (what a great movie series--at least the firt two were....) \n \n Nozza, if this is how your government interprets this wording then it's time for Dorothy to tap her shoes together and leave the land of Oz and come home to Kansas (or Virginia). You would be most welcome if you did, my friend. \n \n \nSection 260. Excessive force \n In any case in which the use of force by one person to another is lawful, the use of more force than is justified by law under the circumstances is unlawful. \n\n \n Again I see this tracking the law of my state. It is a crime to use more force than is reasonably necessary to repel the threat. If deadly force is used against a non-deadly attack, or if deadly force is used after the threat has ended, then it is a crime in Virginia and apparently a similar crime in Oz.\n \n \nSection 297. Grievous bodily harm \n Any person who unlawfully does grievous bodily harm to another is guilty of a crime, and is liable to imprisonment for 10 years. \n\n \n In Virignia we call this crime \"Malicious wounding,\" and it is punished by not less than 5 nor more than 20 years imprisonment. In Virginia, wounding another while acting in legitimate self-defense is a defense to this crime-and apparently it is the same in Oz. The language \"who unlawfully does bodily harm\" is key here-for if the rest of the law cited from Oz is accurate then doing \"great bodily harm to another\" while acting in legitimate self-defense would be \"lawful\" and thus a defense against prosecution.\n \n All of this assumes, of course, that the law is correctly cited and that Oz is blessed with ministers of justice who take their oaths to uphold the law seriously. If not, then the invitation to join us remains open, Nozza.\n \n Hey, didn't we have a guy named \"Subaru\" who jumped in here one time claiming to be a law student in Oz and who had a professor who interpreted American self defense law for us (albeit very incorrectly)? Does anyone know how to reach him and see if either he or his professor friend would be willing to take a crack at the law of self-defense in the land of Oz? I would be interested in hearing what they would have to say. \n \n ---\n \n \"The right of self-defense is the first law of nature; in most governments it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest possible limits...and [when] the right of the people to keep and bear arms is, under any color or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of destruction.\" Sir George Tucker, Judge of the Virginia Supreme Court and U.S. District Court of Virginia, in I Blackstone COMMENTARIES, Sir George Tucker Ed., 1803, pg. 300.",

You will be charged with a crime for doing so.\n \n I personally do not believe you should be tried by 12 if you use a firearm in self defense and i believe if you do it is against your god given rights. \n \n Just for kicks have a read of this DRIBBLE!!\n \n Gun Control Australia",

   "Well I don't claim to be an expert on Aussie law, but I do understand the subset of the English language referred to as \"legalese.\" So let me again try to call it like I see it....\n \n \n \n To me this merely restates the common law of deadly force-that deadly force may be used only in response to a threat of death or great bodily harm. This tracks the well with the law of my state. Additionally, the language Sarge highlighted \"for using any such force as is reasonably necessary for such preservation\" is merely a re-statement that the law of self-defense is the law of necessity and not retaliation-that your right of self-defense ends when it no longer becomes necessary to use force to defend yourself. \n \n Say, for example, you shoot the knife wielding would-be robber and he falls to the ground dropping his knife. So far so good. Now his motive may have only been to get your money, but he chose to threaten you with death or great bodily harm to get it. This authorized you to use deadly force to end the threat. And if while lying on the ground he complains about the case of lead poising you just gave him then you can say \"if you're going to be stupid then you've got to be tough, and you were the dumb a$$ who thought it was a great idea to bring a knife to a gunfight.\" Again, so far so good. But if after saying this you walk up to him and shoot him again while he lies unarmed and unable to threaten you further-well then you are no longer using such force \"reasonably necessary\" for \"preservation\" of your life, and you would have crossed the legal line from legitimate self-defense to a criminal act motivated by anger/hatred/revenge, etc. This is the law of my state, and this is how I read the above language presented to us as the law of Oz. \n \n \n \n The heading provides the clue to what this legal clip is speaking about-Aiding in self-defense. In Virginia we call this \"defense of others.\" In a nutshell it means this: If I am attacked and a good Samaritan tried to come to my defense, then he is entitled to use the same level of force to defend me that I could have lawfully used to defend myself. This is the law of defense of others in Virginia, and this is also how I read this language presented to us again as the law of Oz. \n \n Now if some fool in law enforcement in Oz has really decided to interpret this to mean you can only use a like or some less powerful weapon than those used by your attacker, then I invite them to come back to this side of the looking glass, put down the pipe, and surrender this absurd notion. I mean really, for an anti-gunner to read it this way is counterproductive, for that interpretation only serves the ridiculous purpose of encouraging people to go around armed like Mel Gibson's \"Mad Max\" character-armed to the teeth with every conceivable weapon so you could be ready to fight knife for knife, bat for bat, revolver for revolver, etc. (what a great movie series--at least the firt two were....) \n \n Nozza, if this is how your government interprets this wording then it's time for Dorothy to tap her shoes together and leave the land of Oz and come home to Kansas (or Virginia). You would be most welcome if you did, my friend. \n \n \n \n Again I see this tracking the law of my state. It is a crime to use more force than is reasonably necessary to repel the threat. If deadly force is used against a non-deadly attack, or if deadly force is used after the threat has ended, then it is a crime in Virginia and apparently a similar crime in Oz.\n \n \n \n In Virignia we call this crime \"Malicious wounding,\" and it is punished by not less than 5 nor more than 20 years imprisonment. In Virginia, wounding another while acting in legitimate self-defense is a defense to this crime-and apparently it is the same in Oz. The language \"who unlawfully does bodily harm\" is key here-for if the rest of the law cited from Oz is accurate then doing \"great bodily harm to another\" while acting in legitimate self-defense would be \"lawful\" and thus a defense against prosecution.\n \n All of this assumes, of course, that the law is correctly cited and that Oz is blessed with ministers of justice who take their oaths to uphold the law seriously. If not, then the invitation to join us remains open, Nozza.\n \n Hey, didn't we have a guy named \"Subaru\" who jumped in here one time claiming to be a law student in Oz and who had a professor who interpreted American self defense law for us (albeit very incorrectly)? Does anyone know how to reach him and see if either he or his professor friend would be willing to take a crack at the law of self-defense in the land of Oz? I would be interested in hearing what they would have to say. \n \n ---\n \n \"The right of self-defense is the first law of nature; in most governments it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest possible limits...and [when] the right of the people to keep and bear arms is, under any color or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of destruction.\" Sir George Tucker, Judge of the Virginia Supreme Court and U.S. District Court of Virginia, in I Blackstone COMMENTARIES, Sir George Tucker Ed., 1803, pg. 300.\n\n \n I will cirtainally take up your kind offer to come to the USA. \n \n Just to let you know I do not actually believe in australia you can use a firearm to defend someone else.",
