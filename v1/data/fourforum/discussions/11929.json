The uniqueness of \"Mormons\" to get \"fired up\" is irrelevant.\n \n The point is that Mormons, as a religious group, did act on the behest of their religious leaders.\n If we're differing in simple semantics, then hopefully we can quickly pass that hurdle and move on.\n \n \n \nCertainly you are insinuating that the church leaders were campaigning for \"yes on 8\" using methods that violate the statute you quote but so far they are only insinuations.\n\n I am stating that.\n \n \n \nHow is what I said like that.\n\n Sigma: Preaching against homosexuality might be specifically relevant to a current political issue, but since that has occurred both before and after prop 8 existed I don't believe that charge can be leveled against them.\n Your standard, \"since that has occurred both before and after prop 8 existed\", does not lead to any logical conclusion of \"I don't believe that charge can be leveled against them\".\n \n Furthermore, it's not just \"preaching against homosexuality\" which is the issue.\n Church leaders SPECIFICALLY asked their church for donations.\n It's not just an issue of \"preaching against homosexuality\".

   "California officials will investigate accusations that the Mormon Church neglected to report a battery of nonmonetary contributions - including phone banks, a Web site and commercials - on behalf of a ballot measure to ban same-sex marriage.\n \n Roman Porter, the executive director of the Fair Political Practices Commission, which oversees California campaign finance laws, signed off on the investigation after reviewing a sworn complaint filed on Nov. 13.\n \n The complaint, filed by Fred Karger, founder of the group Californians Against Hate, asserted that the church's reported contributions - about $5,000, according to state election filings - vastly underestimated its actual efforts in passing Proposition 8, which amended the state's Constitution to recognize only male-female marriage.\n \n Broadly speaking, California state law requires disclosure of any money spent or services provided to influence the outcome of an election.\n \n Mr. Porter said the announcement of the investigation was not \"a determination on the validity of the claims or the culpability of the individuals,\" but that the claims had been reviewed by a lawyer for the commission and its chief of enforcement and deemed worth pursuing.\n \n Kim Farah, a spokeswoman for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, issued a statement Tuesday saying it had received the complaint and would cooperate with the investigation. Frank Schubert, campaign manager for the leading group behind Proposition 8, said the accusations were baseless and made by a \"rogue group.\"\n \n Responding to a plea from Mormon Church leaders to \"become involved in this important cause,\" members contributed millions of dollars and volunteered for countless hours on behalf of Proposition 8. The ballot measure passed with 52 percent of the vote, leading to protests and boycotts of supporters of the proposition, including some Mormon temples and businesses.\n \n Mr. Karger's complaint paints a sweeping picture of the involvement by the church leadership, and raises questions about who paid for out-of-state phone banks and grass-roots rallies in California before the Nov. 4 vote.\n \n \"Who paid for the buses, travel costs, meals and other expenses of all the Mormon participants?\" the complaint reads. \"No contributions were reported.\"\n \n The complaint also touches on a five-state simulcast from church leaders to Mormon congregations, as well as a Web site, preservingmarriage.org, that featured a series of videos advocating passage of the ballot measure and is labeled \"an official Web site\" of the Mormon Church.\n \n Ms. Farah said the church had no comment on the particular accusations in the complaint.\n \n If found in violation of election laws, the church could face fines of up to $5,000 per violation, Mr. Porter said. Bigger fines could also be levied by a civil court. http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/26/us/politics/26marriage.html?ref=us\n \n About time! emoticon_xagree",

   "You do realize that, with such an application of the Lemon Test as yours, the recognition of marriage itself--a religiously cultural institution--could be struck down, right? Solemnizing a religious institution TO BEGIN WITH doesn't have a legitimate secular purpose and could just as easily be called an 'excessive entanglement of government and religion.'\n \n But even then, you're entire attempt of trying to invoke the Lemon test here assumes the premise that it's a religious amendment anyway. It's not like the ballot initiative was a religious question. It would be different if the amendment put forth actual religion--it doesn't. A person could certainly support it and not be religious at all!\n \n Kudos to you for finally getting into some specifics though, no matter how \"boring\" they might be to you.\n\n \n Since when was marriage a \"religious institution\"?

Gays make up only about five percent of the population. We got 48% of the \"against\" Prop 8 vote.\n This move to ensure separation of church and state is not just about gays. It isn't just the gays who are pushing it.\n \n Separation of church and state is also a standard which has existed for a long time, independent of this issue. There is other news (before the election) about several churches who were part of an organization who were expressly violating the law's interpretation of \"separation of church and state\" in order to prompt a legal confrontation, presumably in an effort to get the courts to overturn the current interpretation and application of \"separation of church and state\".\n The separation of church and state issue has a much bigger theme, independent of the Mormon issue.\n The churches mentioned above basically campaigned from the pulpit.\n I see what the Mormon church is accused of doing as far worse.

   "Another reason that taking away tax-exempt status from churches in response to prop 8 is pretty darn pointless is that it wouldn't really change anything, or even make things worse in terms of political churches. Does anyone actually think that if tax-exempt status were taken away from political-type churches, they would suddenly slap their heads and say \"OH, ok. I'll stop now.\" Heck no. Make them pay taxes, and they'll just become a political group that pays taxes instead of a political group that doesn't. In fact, you'll basically take away any reason for them to try to walk a non-political line if they really don't want to be non-political.\n \n I'm of the personal view that politics has no place in churches. (Not as a statement of legal view on my part, but a values one.) But if I were the sort that wanted to be political in the pulpit, I'd just go ahead and choose not to accept tax-exempt status, and pay taxes so I could say whatever the heck I'd want. If you make these political churches give up tax exempt status, you're just going to give them that much more freedom to be political at that point. It's not like they're avoiding being political already anyway. \n \n And besides, if these churches suddenly said \"ok, we'll incorporate and pay taxes\", would gay rights proponents at that point actually just nod and say \"ok, then you can take a stand now as a church on these issues; we won't object to you being a part of the process like everyone else is\"? Heh ... do elephants fly at night? Um... no.\n \n Regardless, I see little in law to support the idea that churches can't take a stand on a how one votes on a ballot initiative. If it were a CANDIDATE, it would be a different story, as this is regulated by the 1954 Johnson amendment. But not ballot initiatives; the amendment is quite specific in stating that its application is over candidate support. Of course you never hear these folks who start calling for taxing churches when it's DNC candidates like Obama being promoted in pulpits, even though there's MORE legal basis for THAT being illegal (due to the Johnson Amendment) than support of prop 8.",
