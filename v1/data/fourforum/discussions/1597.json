If a photon is turly a boson, then it cannot interact with ferioms (bad spelling) in anyway except when it has charatiristics of a particle. When it does go higher up on the spectrum it does have the effects of mass, without actually having matter because of the \"insert term here\" way in which the energy is (its state of exsistance). The question could then be posed that when photons on the lower end of the spectrum behave like waves they do not show the charatristics of matter so it can be then assumed the answer to the question is that matter is not the part of photons, but photons behave as if they do have mass because of the \"re-insert term here\" way in which the energy is (its state of exsistence). \n \n You may have heard how matter can be a wave or a particle and assumed that photons which can be both wave-like and particle-like so that must mean they have matter?
