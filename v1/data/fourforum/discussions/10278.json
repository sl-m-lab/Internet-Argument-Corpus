   "You can not find AL Qeada in Syria, they are not present. Why?\n You can not find AL Qeada in Iran, they are not present. Why?\n \n Where can you find AL Qeada? In Iraq; But what allows them to operate there?\n \n The U.S. military does not allow the Militias to mobilize, they can not defend or face an AL Qeada threat.\n \n In other words, the very presence of U.S. Forces in Iraq is the only way AL Qeada can hope to stay in Iraq. How can I say that?\n \n The Shia Militias are massive compared to AL Qeada. AL Qeada blew up the Golden Mosque and the Shias want hit them in a bad way. Believe that. They can't do that because the U.S. will not allow them to mobilize.\n \n So if you ever hear; We are in Iraq to address AL Qeada, know your being miss led. This is not so.\n \n We might be in Iraq to prevent genocide and thats honorable. THe Shia could go beyond the killing of AL Qeada and continue with the Sunni. But is it as honorable to tell the truth to the people that die for you?\n \n One other thing to understand about AL Qeada. It is a Sunni terror group and will not allow non-Sunni. A Shia can not be an AL Qeada member and in fact AL Qeada beleves the Shia are traitors to the faith which should explain why they attack the Shia sects. to this day.",

   "Heck its not even about Al Queda. Its about oil, oil, oil, oil. \n \n But you are right given the freedom to do so the Iraquis would likely bump off Al Queda, and the various factions would be so engrossed in fighting each other for power none would present any direct threat to the US. It would also tend to lock down the Iranians as they got emeshed in the same gears. I say let em try to fill the power vaccum and watch em get sucked in just like we were.",

   "I've been called nuts for saying it, but I truly believe that we attacked Saddam because of his threat to get off the U.S. Dollar. Our lack of exports has our currency at risk. \n \n The United States is the least likely country to be attacked and yet we have armies in 140 countries through out the world. Our neighboring countries are at peace with us and Russia's only complaint with us is our expansion of missile bases in their former territories.\n \n I know there is a master plan somewhere and I would simply like to know what it is. We the People are the nation.",
