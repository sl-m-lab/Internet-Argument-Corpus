   "Is it?\n \n Is how you present something really more important than what's actually being presented?\n \n From religion to politics to common marketing, often it seems that humans are more concerned with how something sounds, looks and feels to us rather than whether it is truthful, useful or even non-hazardous to us.\n \n I know that many people spend long hours working on the various arts/sciences of manipulation to sway someone to their side or get someone to buy something they may not want or even need.\n \n So, what are your takes on this?\n \n Do you buy items for no reason?\n Engage in activities that are seemingly nonsensical?\n Adhear to a belief or idea that tickles your ear?\n \n Do you use propagandic tactics to try to sway others to your viewpoint rather than rely on factual information?\n \n I find various manipulations fascinating and readily see them is most posters responses...even my own. \n I was wondering if others out there spot them too. Or if you try to kid yourself and think you're free from biased actions and subtle manipulative behaviors.",

   "I think there's quite a difference between presentations designed to sell and presentations designed to inform. I've made some where the goal was to withold enough information to make the audience thirst for more. It can be done.\n \n Presentation is important in the restuarant world. No self-respecting entree chef wants to see his masterpiece going to the table in less than beautiful shape. That precipitates the use of garlands such as parsely, paprika, red peppers, etc. to give color to the presentation. Of course, an artistically applied smidgeon of a delicious sauce, dripped in a provocative pattern around the entree (a half-dollar sized medalion of pork sitting amongst four peas, a thin slice of carrot and three string beans) in such a manner as to make it seem that the food stretches from one side of the plate to the other in all directions is the chef's way of making you think you got your money's worth in quantity...before you start eating.\n \n In my world, presentation is not so important as content. It makes no sense to put lipstick on a pig. You still have a pig.",

   "Presentation is very important no matter if you believe otherwise. That is because people are more emotional than rational beings. Ok, some small procentage of people are more rational than emotional types, I don't remember at the moment the exact ratio, but its much more in favor of emotional types. But even for those rational there are selling strategies developed. So no matter what type you are you are more or less a sitting duck for the advertising agencies. And propaganda. \n I once read an article whih talked about that people are more inclined to believe rumors even if they know for a fact that the rumor is not true. There was a study done confirming this thesis. Quite scarry if you ask me.\n \n Not that I mind, I also find various manipulative tactics interesting and fascinating...and I do occasionaly fall victim to them. There is always some trick or two you don't know about, but with me it must be something really special to duck my fiters. On the other hand, sometimes it really gives me a kick to see someone trying them on me. Unsuccessfully of course. Just to see how far a person would go to achieve his or her goal.\n \n As far as manipulation of others go, I do use it. Like we all use it. Manipulation is part of human interaction, like it or not. The only difference is, most don't even know they are using manipulative actions. The only problem I see in manipulation is, apart from that that in a perfect world is one of the bad bad things emoticon_xangel, when it steps over the boundries of normality and its scrupiously applied no matter what the cost to others.\n \n \nIs it?\n Do you buy items for no reason?\n Engage in activities that are seemingly nonsensical?\n Adhear to a belief or idea that tickles your ear?\n\n \n I don't buy items I will not need.\n I don't engage in activities that are seemingly nonsensical. Because they are a waste of my time.\n Fot the most part I don't adher to a belief or idea tht tickle my ear. Because it just tickles my ear and nothing more.",
