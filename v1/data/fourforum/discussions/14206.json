He stopped the shooter before he could kill even more people even if he did get shot himself. So he did save lives. But he didnt see the other person because of his goggles. Plus its unrealistic to say that there would be another shooter already in the room. In fact that hasnt happened yet in real life as far as I know. \n \n And as for Ashley. She didnt seem like she actually knew what she was doing with the gun. When they showed her shooting at the stationary targets she took forever to aim and shoot at the target. She isnt the type of person who is going to be carrying a weapon. And as for her almost shooting one of the students. The student ran towards the shooter. Do you think that would happen in real life? Probably not. Most people would be in shock and the ones who arnt would duck for cover or run away from the shooter. \n \n Really though the main situation a concealed carry permits would help in isnt like the situation that is in the study. It is for when there has already been shots fired and they now know there is a shooter in the building.
