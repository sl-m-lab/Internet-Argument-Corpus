Then they killed a top tribal sheik who headed the Fallujah city council. Then they assassinated the leader of the al-Jubur tribe.\n \n And now the reported killers of all these men -- al-Qaeda in Iraq, the insurgent group of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi -- have a powerful new enemy.\n \n Tribal chiefs in Iraq's western Anbar province and in an area near the northern city of Kirkuk, two regions teeming with insurgents, are vowing to strike back at al-Qaeda in Iraq, a Sunni Arab-led group that is waging war against Sunni tribal leaders who are cooperating with the Iraqi government and the U.S. military. Anbar tribes have formed a militia that has killed 20 insurgents from al-Qaeda in Iraq, leaders said.",

   "Could this indicate that our actions in Iraq have led only to disorder, and that US warmongering arrogant stupidity will only continue to make things worse?\n \n US envoy delivers blunt view of Iraq's future\n \n \nAmerica's ambassador in Baghdad has grimly acknowledged that the US invasion of Iraq three years ago had opened a \"Pandora's box\" that could see the country descend into full-scale civil war.\n \n That point had not yet been reached, Zalmay Khalilzad, the envoy, told the Los Angeles Times yesterday. But \"the potential is there.\" All it might take, he warned, was an incident similar to last month's bombing of the Shi'ite Muslim shrine in Samarra, that unleashed a wave of sectarian killings.\n \n \"Right now there's a vacuum of authority, and there's a lot of distrust,\" said Mr Khalilzad. He insisted that the only way forward was to continue efforts to form a government of national unity. In the meantime there was no option but for the US to keep its troops in Iraq.\n \n The alternative was to risk the country falling apart, with rival religious extremists taking over portions of it. This in turn could bring about massive disruptions of energy supplies, as conflict engulfed the region, with Arab states backing the Sunnis and Iran throwing its weight behind the Shi'ites.\n \n Mr Khalilzad's blunt words contrast with the efforts of the Bush administration to soothe anxieties here, and convince an ever more sceptical domestic audience that its policies are working. Only last weekend General Peter Pace, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff was insisting that things were going \"very, very well\" in Iraq........\n\n \n We should never have gone there, we have no business being there. Until recently I believed that seeing as we are there, it was for the best to stay there so our army could prevent the violence escalating from suicide bombings to full-scale conflict. \n \n Now I am unsure that we are really comitted to this. I never swallowed the government's BS about wanting to help the Iraqi people (any more than I swallowed the BS about WMDs, links to terror, or whatever the official focus was on any given day), and now, looking at the reality of the situation, I don't know if our governments really give a damn if the country goes haywire.\n \n If we really want to clamp down on the violence, we need to pour far more money and effort into reconstruction. We made the mess, we need to clean it up. We also need a much larger international peacekeeping force there, which means getting the UN involved (I can hear the anguished wails from the right-wingers).\n \n But it may be too late. Iraq has not become the profit vehicle for Western companies that our leaders hoped it would, and if we are so incompetent as to be unable to contain the violence, on top of all the other mistakes we have made at every turn, I see little point in keeping troops there.",

In fact, I applaud the use of surgical bombing and laser guided munitions to limit the damage to specific targets. Carpet bombing is not in my list of desirable methods.\n \n Maybe I'm uninformed about the will of the majority of the Iraqis. Maybe you're misinformed about the claim. You do realize the MSM portrays the war and the results of war as they see fit, not necessarily the way it really is. Polls are skewed by those who run them. Show me something other than your opinion.",

Did I err?\n\n \n Well, if we both think it means Main Stream Media then I don't think you erred.\n \n The reason I was asking is that the one place I've seen it was in a poorly written editorial. The writer was trying to imply one thing, but what was clearly coming across was that he didn't like the fact that \"MSM\" was saying bad things about Bush, so he was only going to listen to fringe news that said things he liked from now on. Accuracy wasn't the issue, he just didn't like to hear bad things about Bush. \n \n There are conservative think tanks whose job it is to come up with and disseminate catch phrases and buzz words, for the purpose of shaping political conversation and promoting conservative agendas. \"MSM\" smacks of this sort of thing, so I was curious where you had heard it and why it caught your fancy enough for you to want to use it yourself. The editorial I saw wasn't very good, so it seemed unlikely to be your source.",
