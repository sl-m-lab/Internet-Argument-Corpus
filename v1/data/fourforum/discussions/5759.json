   "They've just informed us: mass arrests of Georgians began in Europe. Austrian police detained more than 40 representatives of this nationality, and Spanish police - over 180. Oh, what's the sense of chewing it all over! Thus our European powers try to fight against Chechen and Georgian Mafia that has meshed the whole EU now. The process of so-called consolidation of these Mafiosi began in the days of Shevardnadze, who allowed Chechen militants to set up their house in Pankissi. There is no secret that foreign Georgian Diasporas very quickly embarked on the road of their Chechen brothers-in-arms. And so now they are also a threat to our security and stability. Georgians, arrested in Spain, arrived there under the guise of refugees, of course. You see, it became very easy to get documents, warranted this legal status. It's common knowledge that some nongovernment organizations, based in Georgia and Azerbaijan and cooperated with Chechen criminal groups, are involved in illicit realization of such kind of documents. There are some grounds to suppose that Georgians, plundered in Europe, pay contribution to their President, Saakashvili. Their money goes to the expenses of future war against rebellious Georgian autonomies, such as Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Horse trade, isn't it?",
