Suppose that I see such a plate and file suit against the Florida DoT. Such a case would probably be summarily dismissed because I lacked standing. Even if we presume that I actually were a citizen of the State of Florida, such a violation does me no damage. I didn't pay the extra premium involved so the money going to some religious charity didn't come from me or tax revenues of the State in any way.

All you need is to show the government supporting a religion. There have been cases where donated crosses were removed from government grounds, even though there was no tax payer money involved.\n \n I suppose if you wanted to cast it in a personal light you could find a Jew or a Muslim and have them try to get a plate with their holy symbol on it, thus firmly casting the case in a \"government showing preference to a specific religion\" light.",
