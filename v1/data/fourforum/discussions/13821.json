   "As an individual, I often make snide remarks towards others who have beliefs that are contrary to my own. (Who me?) This is one of those times where my instant \"reaction\" is to spout off at the mouth and let my brain catch up either later, or not at all.\n \n Rather than use my well tuned sarcasm generator, I will choose to answer in a genial manner instead of with my usual rancor.\n \n Although it makes me wonder, I realize there are people in this world that have a problem realizing that we each have a sovereign body. I may go into the grocery store, a church, or someone else's house and in each of those places, I am a guest. I obey the rules and stipulations that one must abide by in order to remain a welcome guest. If I break these rules, I become unwelcome. I am able to be told to leave, and if I fail to do so, I may be physically removed.\n \n The same principles go along with individual persons. You cannot posess my body. You may get into my personal space, come into my house, dance a jig on the roof of my car, but there is one place you cannot go, no matter how hard you try, and that is into me. As an individual, I am sovereign unto myself.\n \n When you physically try to do something to me, I may agree with it. I may like this action you are performing. Otherwise, if I do not like this action you are performing, I may ask you to stop, desist, or leave. (Just like the proscribed rules for guests.)\n \n Do I not have the right, as a sovereign self, to choose what may, or may not, happen to myself?\n \n What happens when a \"guest\" refuses to abide by the rules? What happens when another individual even goes so far as to attempt to end you?\n \n As a sovereign self, do you not have the right to self determination? Or is it truly up to Joe Switchblade who wants $20 and your White Castle Burger to decide whether or not you get to continue?\n \n This is why even the question that Joe Switchblade has an inkling of a right to decide what I have for breakfast, much less whether or not I get to open my eyes ever again, makes me wonder why a human being would consider asking, not to mention not know the answer.\n \n Then I realize that yes, there are people...no, wait...there are governments that wish to be the sole determiner of who decides self sovereignity. It's only the people who decide whether or not to let them have the power to do so.\n \n As we can see in this article, the government there has decreed that it is in charge of detemining a person's right to self determination. The question isn't \"Do you think government is right to do this?\" the question is \"Are you going to let them continue?\"\n \n As I have illustrated above, the question of self defense is the same as self determination. If not you, who do you think should decide your fate?\n \n The answer is obvious. I tried to state it using an intelligent and reasoned approach rather than spout off a simple and ill defined smart remark.\n \n Now that I have stated my answer. (Which I feel is pretty much unquestionably in favor of the individual person deciding their own fate instead of Larry down at the furniture repair shop.) It leads to further questions.......\n \n ...If an individual person has a right to defend their own life, what methods are allowed if the people who would remove it have the freedom to choose any means?\n \n Why should Bob the PCP deranged sociopath get his preference to end you, but the government says you can only use pepper spray, a rolling pin, or a telephone call to prevent him from harming you?\n \n If you are in charge of your own self determination, why should the government get to limit your choice of the means to do so when any nutcase will use anything imaginable to kill you?\n \n Who's side is the government on?",

   "The laws governing the right of self defense vary among the jurisdictions. Here, for example, is a summary of the law of self defense in Virginia:\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/gun-control-debates/4779-natural-right-self-defense-use-deadly-force-virginia.html\n \n The laws of self defense in others states may or may not be similar.\n \n On the federal law side, Dave Kopel has produced a solid outline of some of the older SCOTUS cases dealing with the right of self defense:\n \n THE SELF-DEFENSE CASES: HOW THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT CONFRONTED A HANGING JUDGE IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY AND TAUGHT SOME LESSONS FOR JURISPRUDENCE IN THE TWENTY-FIRST\n \n I briefly searched my SCOTUS database looking for an approved federal jury instruction on self defense (something that would explain the law in a case where a person were charged with murder, for example, and who claimed that the killing was done in self defense). I found SCOTUS citing with approval (in Dixon v. United States, 548 U.S. 1, 24 (2006)) a model instruction form used by courts in the 1st. Circuit referred to as \"First Circuit Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions \u00a7 5.04 (1998).\" I found that instruction and post it here:\n \n If you find that the government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt all the elements of the crime, you must then determine whether [defendant] has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that [he/she] committed the crime only because of justification. For you to find [defendant] not guilty only because of justification, you must be persuaded that [defendant] has proven each of these things by a preponderance of the evidence:\n First, [defendant] acted under an unlawful and immediate threat that would provoke a well grounded apprehension of serious bodily injury or death;\n Second, [defendant] did not recklessly [or negligently] place [himself/herself] in such a situation;\n Third, [defendant] had no reasonable, legal alternative, that is, no chance both to refuse to perform the criminal act and to avoid the threatened harm; and\n Fourth, [defendant] committed the crime only because of the threat.\n \"Preponderance of the evidence\" is evidence that considered in light of all the facts, leads you to believe that what [he/she] claims is more likely true than not.\n \n Most instruction handbooks contain \"comments\" that help explain the instruction. The comments that follow the above instruction are:\n \n Comment\n (1) The United States Supreme Court has stated that \"[t]here is no federal statute defining the elements of the duress defense, and that \"[w]e have not specified the elements of the defense.\" Dixon v. United States, 548 U.S. 1, 5 n.2 (2006). In Dixon, the Court used a four-element test applied by the district court, but stated that it merely \"presume[d] the accuracy of the District Court's description of these elements.\" Id. Soon thereafter, in a felon-in-possession case, the First Circuit \"adopt[ed] the four-part framework for justification discussed by the Supreme Court in Dixon,\" United States v. Leahy, 473 F.3d 401, 403, 406 (1st Cir. 2007), and applied it as a generic \"justification\" defense, stating that self-defense, duress, and necessity all fit \"under a single, unitary rubric: justification.\" Leahy did not say that its unitary rubric and four-element test were limited to felon-in-possession cases. It did state that \"although we believe it is useful to speak of a single justification defense, we caution that different factual scenarios may require variations in the phrasing of the four-factor test. . . . Those nuances remain to be developed in future cases.\" Id. at 409. Soon thereafter, in a drug distribution case, the First Circuit reverted to its previous three factor test for duress without any reference to Leahy, a unitary justification defense, or a four element test. See United States v. Bravo, 489 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 2007).\n (2) The First Circuit has not decided whether, in the second element, negligence as well as recklessness is sufficient to maintain the defense. Leahy, 473 F.3d at 409, n.8. 227\n (3) \"In assessing whether a defendant has established sufficient grounds to mount a duress defense, courts do not examine the defendant's subjective perceptions about whether the threat was likely to be acted upon or whether escape was possible. Rather, as suggested by our use of the qualifiers 'well-grounded' and 'reasonable' in describing the elements of the defense, the inquiry hypothesizes a defendant of ordinary firmness and judgment and asks what such a defendant was likely to have experienced or how such a defendant was likely to have acted.\" United States v. Castro-Gomez, 360 F.3d 216, 219 (1st Cir. 2004) (citation omitted). Dixon, however, uses only the adjective \"well-grounded.\" 548 U.S. at 5 n.2.\n (4) In Dixon, the Court held squarely that the burden of proof in a duress defense rests upon the defendant, and the standard is proof by a preponderance. 548 U.S. at 17. The First Circuit recognizes the availability of a justification defense in a federal felon-in-possession case, and assigns the burden of proof to the defendant. Leahy, 473 F.3d at 409. There may be a narrow exception where the duress affects the mens rea for the crime. See id. (burden of proof holding is limited to justification defenses that \"do not go to the elements of the crime\"). In Dixon, however, the mens rea was knowledge of falsity or knowledge of law-breaking, and the Court held that perceived duress did not negate that required state of mind.\n (5) \"A necessity instruction is appropriate only where there is evidence sufficient to create a triable issue that a defendant 'had no legal alternative but to violate the law.'\" United States v. Holliday, 457 F.3d 121, 128 (1st Cir. 2006) (quoting United States v. Ayala, 289 F.3d 16, 26 (1st Cir. 2002).\n (6) Before the justification defense can go to the jury, the court must determine that the defendant has met the \"entry-level burden\" of producing enough evidence to support the defense's elements. United States v. Ayala, 289 F.3d 16, 26 (1st Cir. 2002) (necessity); United States v. Maxwell, 254 F.3d 21, 26 (1st Cir. 2001) (same); see also United States v. Sued-Jimenez, 275 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2001); United States v. Arthurs, 73 F.3d 444, 448 (1st Cir. 1996); United States v. Amparo, 961 F.2d 288, 291 (1st Cir. 1992). The entry-level burden is a burden of production, not persuasion. United States v. Bailey, 444 U.S. 394, 415 (1980); cf. Amparo, 961 F.2d at 291 (describing the burden of production necessary to support the defense of duress).",

Doesn't Castle Doctrine merely put the burden of proof on the prosecution (where it should rightly be) in order to prove a defendant's guilt, rather than place the burden on the defendant to prove he is innocent (when his innocence is already supposed to be presumed until proven otherwise)?\n \n In other words: Doesn't Castle Doctrine pre-empt the cases you have stated by ruling that the prosecution must prove the defendant acted WITHOUT justification instead of ruling that a defendant (Who is presumed innocent, remember?) must prove they did?\n\n \n Good questions. Let me make up a murder case to illustrate my answer. Assume we are in Virginia. Allen shoots and kills Bob with a gun. Let&#8217;s say I claim as the prosecutor that Allen shoots Bob because he is angry with him over an ex-girlfriend, and I charge him with first degree murder for killing Bob. Every person charged with a crime is presumed innocent, and the first and most important jury instruction in every case reads like this: \n \n The defendant is presumed to be innocent. You should not assume the defendant is guilty because he has been indicted and is on trial. This presumption of innocence remains with the defendant throughout the trial and is enough to require you to find the defendant not guilty unless and until the Commonwealth proves each and every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. This does not require proof beyond all possible doubt, nor is the Commonwealth required to disprove every conceivable circumstance of innocence. However, suspicion or probability of guilt is not enough for a conviction.\n There is no burden on the defendant to produce any evidence.\n A reasonable doubt is a doubt based on your sound judgment after a full and impartial consideration of all the evidence in the case.\n \n Note the instruction says &#8220;each and every element of the offense.&#8221; This is because every crime is defined by one or (usually) more than one factual elements. There are three factual elements in first degree murder, and the jury instruction for that crime reads as follows: \n \n The defendant is charged with the crime of first degree murder. The Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt each of the following elements of that crime:\n (1) That the defendant killed Bob; and\n (2) That the killing was malicious; and\n (3) That the killing was willful, deliberate, and premeditated. \n If you find from the evidence that the Commonwealth has proved beyond a reasonable doubt each of the above elements of the above offense as charged, then you shall find the defendant guilty, but you shall not fix the punishment until your verdict has been returned and further evidence has been heard by you.\n If you find that the Commonwealth has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt any one or more of the elements of the offense, then you shall find the defendant not guilty of first degree murder.\n \n Note the repetition of the concept of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. So at trial I claim the shooting was done in anger, which I claim is proof the shooting was done &#8220;maliciously&#8221;. A separate instruction would also be offered to further define the second element of malice:\n \n THE COURT INSTRUCTS THE JURY THAT malice is the state of mind which results in the intentional doing of a wrongful act to another without legal excuse or justification, at a time when the mind of the actor is under the control of reason. Malice may result from any unlawful or unjustifiable motive including anger, hatred or revenge. Malice may be inferred from any deliberate willful and cruel act against another, however sudden.\n \n Now the jury knows what I as the prosecutor must prove to convict Allen. Allen is still presumed innocent, and he has no obligation to prove his innocence or even put on any evidence. If I cannot convince a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that Allen&#8217;s shooting of Bob involved each and every one of the three elements of the crime then Allen must be found not guilty. \n \n SELF DEFENSE\n \n So now let&#8217;s assume Allen has confessed to shooting Bob, but he claims he asked Bob a question about the ex-girlfriend and Bob responds by suddenly attacking Allen with a knife&#8212;forcing Allen to act in self-defense. The right of self-defense fits into the mix in this fashion: It is recognized as a &#8220;legal excuse or justification&#8221; that converts what is normally a &#8220;malicious&#8221; and &#8220;wrongful act&#8221; (shooting and killing someone) into a non-malicious and lawful act.\n \n At this point I need to explain that the right of self-defense is what we call an &#8220;affirmative defense&#8221;&#8212;that is&#8212;the jury cannot consider the right of self-defense unless some evidence is presented which raises that issue. This is not shifting the burden of proof onto Allen. Allen is still presumed innocent, and he does not have to prove that he did not act maliciously. But the right of self-defense does allow Allen to try, if he wants, to cast reasonable doubt on whether he acted maliciously by claiming he acted in legitimate self-defense. It does not require Allen to testify or present evidence on his own (although most self-defense claims involve the defendant testifying and explaining why he shot the &#8220;victim&#8221;). He can present self-defense as an issue in the case if he can get those facts from my witnesses. If, for example, I as the prosecutor call the officer who talked to Allen as a witness and the officer testifies that Allen said he shot Bob but claimed Bob attacked him with a knife and he shot him in self-defense then this is enough to grant the self-defense instruction (I&#8217;ll use the justifiable self defense instruction because it is easier to deal with here):\n \n THE COURT INSTRUCTS THE JURY THAT if you believe that the defendant was without fault in provoking or bringing on the difficulty, and that the defendant reasonably feared, under the circumstances as they appeared to him, that he was in danger of harm, then the defendant had the right to use such force as was reasonably necessary to protect himself from the threatened harm. If you further believe that the defendant used no more force that was reasonably necessary to protect himself from the threatened harm, then you shall find the defendant not guilty.\n \n So I still carry the burden of proving all elements of my charged crime&#8212;but now that some evidence exists to allow a claim of self-defense my burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt (on the issue of malice) also requires me to overcome the additional suggestion of legitimate self-defense. If the jury accepts the self-defense explanation then I have failed to prove malice (and really the third element of the crime as well) and Allen is found not guilty. If the jury cannot decide which theory to believe (malice or self defense) then Allen is still found not guilty because I have not proven the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. The only way Allen is lawfully convicted is if the jury not only rejects his claim of self-defense but also further decides there is no reason to doubt he acted with malice (and the other two elements of the offense). \n \n CASTLE DOCTRINE\n \n Now turn to the &#8220;Castle Doctrine.&#8221; It is another &#8220;affirmative defense&#8221; which can be raised in some cases. So let&#8217;s now say that the shooting happened at night. Allen is in his home and Bob is on the front porch of the home. They are talking through the closed front door, and the shooting happens as Bob tries to enter Allen&#8217;s house. Allen claims Bob became enraged, pulled out a knife, and kicked in the front door causing Allen to shoot him. The Castle Doctrine is an additional &#8220;defense of your home&#8221; claim Allen can raise to rebut my evidence of malice. In Virginia the defense exists, but there are only two cases which mention it: \n \n Fortune v. Commonwealth, 133 Va. 669, 686-687, 112 S.E. 861, ___ (1922)\n \n As said in 1 Bish. New Cr. Law (8th Ed.), sections 857, 858: &#8220;* * the general rule is that while a man may use all reasonable and necessary force to defend his real and personal estate, of which he is in the actual possession, against another who comes to dispossess him without right, he cannot innocently carry this defense to the extent of killing the aggressor. [Page 687] If no other way is open to him, he must yield, and get himself righted by resort to the law. A seeming exception to this rule is the &#8212;\n \n &#8220;Defense of the Castle. &#8212; In the early times our forefathers were compelled to protect themselves in their habitations by converting them into holds of defense: and so the dwelling house was called the castle. To this condition of things the law has conformed, resulting in the familiar doctrine that while a man keeps the doors of his house closed, no other may break and enter it, except in particular circumstances to make an arrest or the like &#8212; cases not within the line of our present exposition. From this doctrine is derived another: namely, that the persons within the house may exercise all needful force to keep aggressors out, even to the taking of life. As observed by Campbell, J., in Michigan, &#8216;a man is not obliged to retreat if assaulted in his dwelling, but may use such means as are absolutely necessary to repel the assailant from his house or prevent his forcible entry, even to the taking of life&#8217; * * .&#8221;\n \n But the same learned work continues, in section 858, as follows:\n \n &#8220;1. Waiving Castle. &#8212; One may waive the protection of his castle by permitting another to enter; * *.&#8221;\n \n &#8220;2. Putting out of the Castle. &#8212; If a man enters another's dwelling house peaceable on an implied license, he cannot be ejected except on request to leave, followed by no more than the necessary and proper force, even though misbehaving himself therein.\n \n * * Hence a needless battery, resulting in death, employed in ejecting an intruder from the dwellinghouse, will constitute felonious homicide.&#8221;\n \n Alexander v. Commonwealth, 28 Va. App. 771, 780, 508 S.E.2d 912, ___ (1999) (in a footnote only):\n \n The use of deadly force, in defense of &#8220;property&#8221; can also be justifiable, but the classic formulation lists only arson or burglary as crimes against property which can justify the use of deadly force. . . . Even then the use of deadly force must have been necessary.\n \n Defense of habitation and justifiable self-defense overlap in the &#8220;castle doctrine&#8221; which states that one may, without retreating, use force, to include deadly force if necessary, to keep aggressors out of his own house. This part of the castle doctrine is one aspect of defense of habitation. . . . [T]he justification exists in the curtilage as well as the castle.\n \n Roger D. Groot, Criminal Offenses and Defenses in Virginia 114 (3rd ed. 1994). The defense of habitation and the castle doctrine have not been raised in this case.\n \n So the jury would now be confronted with both the self-defense claim and the &#8220;castle doctrine&#8221; claim, and if they believe either defense fit Allen&#8217;s actions then he is found not guilty, or if either claim merely raises a reasonable doubt about the element of malice then he is found not guilty.\n \n Note also that the castle doctrine defense extends to the &#8220;curtilage,&#8221; which takes it to a limited extent outside your front door and into the outside area surrounding your home. The term &#8220;curtilage&#8221; is most often seen in a 4th. amendment right of privacy context, but I believe the following definition of &#8220;curtilage&#8221; would also apply to the &#8220;castle doctrine&#8221; in my state:\n \n Robinson v. Commonwealth, 45 Va. App. 592, 605-606, 612 S.E.2d 751, ___ (2005): \n Generally, the curtilage of a home is the &#8220;area around the home to which the activity of home life extends.&#8221; Oliver, 466 U.S. at 180; see also Wellford v. Commonwealth, 227 Va. 297, 301, 315 S.E.2d 235, 238 (1984) (defining &#8220;curtilage&#8221; as the &#8220;space necessary and convenient, habitually used for family purposes and the carrying on of domestic employment; the yard, garden or field which is near to and used in connection with the dwelling&#8221;). &#8220;[W]hether a particular place is within the curtilage of the home is determined on a case-by-case basis.&#8221; Jefferson, 27 Va. App. at 16, 497 S.E.2d at 481 (citing United States v. Dunn, 480 U.S. 294, 301 n.4 (1987)). In determining whether the area in question constitutes curtilage, &#8220;particular reference&#8221; to the following four factors is helpful:\n \n [1] the proximity of the area claimed to be curtilage to the home, [2] whether the area is included within an enclosure surrounding the home, [3] the nature of the uses to which the area is put, and [4] the steps taken by the resident to protect the area from observation by people passing by. [Page 606]\n \n Dunn, 480 U.S. at 301; Jefferson, 27 Va. App. at 16, 497 S.E.2d at 481. &#8220;[T]hese factors are useful analytical tools only to the degree that, in any given case, they bear upon the centrally relevant consideration &#8212; whether the area in question is so intimately tied to the home itself that it should be placed under the home's &#8216;umbrella&#8217; of Fourth Amendment protection.&#8221; Dunn, 480 U.S. at 301.\n \n \n As I said the defense is only mentioned in two cases. There is an attempt to have this case law written into a statute in Virginia&#8212;which is something I support.\n \n One final thought....The right of self defense is also referred to as the defense of necessity&#8212;your right of self-defense ends when the threat ends, and it is not a right of retaliation. So let&#8217;s say everything up to this point is true but add these facts: Allen shoots Bob once in the stomach and Bob runs back outside where he collapses on the sidewalk. Allen comes outside, walks up to Bob, and shoots him in the head killing him. Allen&#8217;s initial shooting might be justified by self defense and/or the castle doctrine, but the kill shot becomes a homicide because the act was not required in defense of self or habitation, and was in reality more of an act of revenge or anger. \n \n I used Virginia law here because that's where I work and I know it. The laws of other states and the federal system can and will likely be different....",

   "Here in Missouri, Castle Doctrine extends to one's vehicle since it is considered private property (which it is).\n \n Since you are in an enclosure that is your own property, anyone inside a vehicle ejoys all the rights and priveleges he or she would enjoy in their dwelling.\n \n Therefore, ANYONE (Missouri citizens or Illinois subjects) may posess or carry ANY firearm (loaded or unloaded) in ANY manner (concealed or tossed on the dash) as long as they are legally allowed by law to posess a firearm (non-felon and no orders of protection filed) in ANY vehicle (your RV or your MG) in ANY place (except a post office parking lot).\n \n Something about post office parking lots randomly causes law abiding citizens, who are perfectly normal everywhere else, to go nuts. Just post office parking lots. Wal-Mart parking lots, or gas station parking lots have no special powers. Post office parking lots, however, must have a strange, mind altering, force-field type aura around them that cause normal folks to go berzerk.\n \n Basicly, if you are a living breathing human being, your car is also your home here in Missouri because it is private property. Unless you want to mail a letter.\n \n This is that way it should be. I would also argue that one's person is also private property, therefore, if one is legally allowed to own a firearm, one should be legally allowed to posess it on one's person. (It is private property, correct?)\n \n Yet, I have ALREADY compromised this and applied for a permit to carry a firearm on my person (private property). Why do anti-gunners always want me to \"compromise\"? I already have. Now it's their turn.\n \n \n I feel sorry for the subjects (subjects = no personal sovereignity) of Illinois.\n \n Not only does their government not trust them to be responsible enough to carry their own protection, they can't even posess a firearm in their car (unless one has a FOID card AND it is nonfunctional AND enclosed in a locked case AND out of immediate access [in the trunk])......If it is only three out of four YOU GO TO JAIL!\n \n I wonder how many criminals follow this strict regimen to legally posess an inanimate object on their private property?\n \n Oh, wait....they're criminals! They could care less about those pesky \"murder\" laws.....much less about having their gun in a locked case! \n \n I wonder if the subjects of Illinois feel safer knowing that many \"criminals\" have been hauled off to jail for (gasp) having the audacity to have their registered, disassembled, locked up firearm in the back seat while they were driving down the road instead of in the trunk where a lawful citizen would keep their registered, disassembled, locked up firearm?\n \n Oh, yeah. The subjects of Illinois are too inept to responsibly handle a firearm, yet evidently, they still have the adroitness to reach into the back seat, open a locked case, reassemble a firearm, load, and fire one, all while managing to avoid crashing their moving vehicle.\n \n I can hear the anti-gunners now: \"Why, if we allowed them to carry their registered, disassembled, locked up firearm cases within reach, BLOOD WOULD RUN IN THE STREETS!\"\n \n Isn't it strange: When a subject from Illinois crosses into Missouri, they become a citizen and can lawfully carry a gun in their car? Illinoisians have more rights in Missouri than they do in their own state.",

When they reached the 'holy land' his command was to kill all those who lived there; they didn't because they found 'the women fair' and we have this to blame on some of the problems we are fighting today.\n Turn the Other Cheek -- Clarified\n by Pastor Roger Margerison\n \n One of the most confused statements made is one made by Jesus when he said \"turn the other cheek\". It is not a confusing statement but the lace-wearing clergy has taught that this means we should never strike back, defend ourselves or use violence. This is not what the Master taught.\n \n During the time of His physical visit to the earth there were dangers from many quarters. From government thugs collecting taxes (no connection to the IRS please) to bandits that robbed, raped, killed and kidnapped with impunity. The disciples knew that going about in numbers as they did would deter some of the more timid bad guys. They also knew that some would not be deterred, therefore they carried a couple of rifles, oops, I mean swords. I am sure they carried them visible so they could be seen (this is just a guess though). \n \n The statement of Jesus to turn the other cheek is simply this, \"Slap me because of my testimony for Christ or because I have done you wrong and I will turn the other cheek (or try to). Slap me because I am ugly and I will slap you back.\" The passage of Scripture is talking about restoring something you owe and your personal testimony for the Lord.\n \n If you are a Christian this is doubly important as you know the Bible does not contain error or contradictions. Take the whole teaching of personal responsibility serious.\n \n If you are not a Christian this is a good principle to live by. Wouldn't it be a better world if the gang members that threaten your safety or your lady's security would practice the, \"love your neighbor\" rule? Or even if our president would? (Oh well, never mind that one.)\n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n What does the Bible say about gun control?\n \n Keep and Bear Arms - Gun Owners Home Page - 2nd Amendment Supporters\n \n ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n \n \n Christianity Versus the Second Amendment\n by Brian Puckett\n \n I get angry when I consider the utter garbage that some \"Christian leaders\" nowadays dump on their followers regarding self-defense and the right to keep and bear arms.\n \n Many of today's so-called Christians are anti-gun, anti-Second Amendment, and/or (professedly) \"anti-violence\". When I say \"many Christians\" I mean--for example--all those local churches who endorsed the recent proposal to restrict ammunition sales in Pasadena, California, and who endorse every other gun-control scheme that comes down the pike. And I mean the leadership of the U.S. Presbyterian and Methodist churches, who instruct their members to submit to criminal acts committed against their persons, including rape, because fighting back might harm the criminals, whom the church views as brothers and sisters.\n \n These people wouldn't have the luxury of sitting on their butts opposing \"violence\" if violence had not been done by our forebears in the recent and distant past to give them a wealthy, relatively peaceful country to live in. They wouldn't have that same luxury if policemen and soldiers didn't stand ready daily to do violence for them, thus keeping their soft, weak hands free of blood.\n \n Perhaps the problem originates with contradictions inherent in the foundations of Judeo-Christian doctrine. One, for example, is the commandment \"Thou shalt not kill.\" Some scholars contend that the original commandment was \"Thou shalt not murder\", or to be more precise, the Hebrew version of that statement. If this is correct then church doctrine subordinate to or predicated upon that commandment might be radically altered. \n \n In the realm of specifically Christian doctrine, there is Jesus' reported admonition to those struck on one cheek to \"turn the other cheek\". Many Christians would say that this means we should be passive and not fight our assailants. But another interpretation is that Jesus meant we should turn the other cheek in order to (1) shock and shame one's antagonist, thus providing him a moment to reflect on what he has done, perhaps to reconsider and to apologize (2) force us to hold our temper, rather than immediately striking out and worsening the situation, perhaps beyond repair.\n \n This interpretation, by the standards of any religion, is sound advice. And it is an interpretation acceptable to those who reject the idea that Jesus advocated passivity and total submission in the face of either criminals or tyrants. It is hard to accept that notion when one reads the words of Jesus reported in Luke 22:36-- \"...Let him who has no sword sell his robe and buy one\". And it is hard to accept passivity in the face of evil when Jesus himself didn't behave that way, as when he drove the money changers from the temple with a whip.\n \n Perhaps the doctrinal problem lies in confusing Jesus' acceptance of his divine role on earth with an implied endorsement of passivity in the face of any assault or insult to one's person. In other words, because Jesus did not resist events that were preordained or that were necessary in order to complete the grand design of his life, we should be similarly passive and fatalistic in our own everyday lives. However, the implication of this position is that mortal men and women are on Christ's level, which I believe is an error. Or perhaps the problem is not one of doctrine at all. It could be argued that for centuries the elements of Christian leadership interested in power and control have taught Christians to be meek and submissive in all things in order to achieve the blind obedience of their followers.\n \n In light of the above it is interesting and instructive to note the thoughts of the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzche in his work Beyond Good and Evil:\n \n \"There is a point in the history of society when it becomes so pathologically soft and tender that among other things it sides even with those who harm it, criminals, and does this quite seriously and honestly. Punishing somehow seems unfair to it, and it is certain that imagining 'punishment' and 'being supposed to punish' hurts it, arouses fear in it. 'Is it not enough to render him undangerous? Why still punish? Punishing itself is terrible.' With this question, herd morality, the morality of timidity, draws its ultimate consequence.\"\n \n This is all the more interesting--or depressing, depending on one's point of view--considering that it was written in the year 1886. Worth noting are Nietzche's words a few paragraphs later in the same work:\n \n \"Indeed, with the help of a religion which indulged and flattered the most sublime herd-animal desires, we have reached the point where we find even in political and social institutions an ever more visible expression of this morality: the democratic movement is the heir of the Christian movement.\"\n \n By \"democratic\" Nietzche meant true democracy, direct rule by the masses, combined with (as the context makes clear) a thoroughgoing egalitarian socialism, where everyone is forced to be equal in all things.\n \n One may not agree with Nietzche's analysis in order to find in them food for thought. For example, a bit further down he says of those who espouse this system: \"They are at one in their tough resistance to every special claim, every special right and privilege (which means in the last analysis, every right: for once all are equal nobody needs \"rights\" any more).\"\n \n A huge segment of popular organized Christianity has--I am very sorry to say--become part of this pathetic mass and is an active enemy of the Second Amendment. This has occurred via Christian \"leaders\" who teach that it is wrong to physically resist evil in this world, and their followers' mindless acceptance of an \"approved\" and \"politically correct\" (and I might add \"politically useful\") version of the New Testament.\n \n For myself, I reject any distortion of Christian faith that advocates removing weapons from the hands of regular citizens while letting them remain in the hands of \"super-citizens\" or \"authorities\". I can not and do not believe that it is immoral and wrong for me to use deadly force to protect myself but is moral and right to allow or to appoint someone else--i.e. the police or the military-- to do so. Such a position is contradictory, hypocritical, and amoral. \n \n Underlying this entire discussion lies a simple truism: A man is neither free nor secure unless he is armed, because he may be easily coerced or killed by one who is. This is not a matter of philosophy, but of physics and physiology.\n \n None of this should be construed as an attack on Christianity, a faith which has had a positive influence on so many lives, including my own. I wish more Christians would stand up and say, \"I am a Christian and I believe in the right of self-defense and in the Second Amendment.\" Even better if they say it in church for all to hear and to discuss.\n \n The truth is that the greatest foes of our right to keep and bear arms are the masses of timid, soft, thoughtless, fearful citizens of whatever religion who wish to abdicate the responsibility of self-defense, who wish to remain children forever and to turn over all guns to the \"adults\" in positions of authority: politicians, the police, the military. If these sad creatures don't grow up, we are in for very bad times indeed.",

   "Heck, I'm not even that religious and I get the gist of what these guys are saying. \n \n I never bring Jesus into arguments, because I insist on thinking for myself. The truth is the truth. It doesn't need Jesus in order for it to remain so. For me, \"WWJD\" is just a cop out. I'm a big boy, I can think for myself. Although I admire him (ooooh! sorry! I mean: HIM) as a role model, and believe emulating him is a desirable goal, I refuse to use him as a whipping boy for my beliefs. \"If you don't believe me, Jesus said, blah, blah, blah!\" \n \n Well, to me, if you \"turn the other cheek\" and refuse to defend your religion with violence, and an assailant kills you because of your beliefs, this makes you a martyr. You have died for your religion. Martyr.\n \n Now, if someone is going to kill you for $20 and a White Castle Burger, and you \"turn the other cheek\", what are you giving your life for? Who is the benificiary of your martyrdom? White Castle? How does this affect the state of morality? What is the point? You're not being martyred, your being exterminated. Willingly exterminated.\n \n I'm pretty sure when Jesus said to turn the other cheek, he meant to not \"retaliate\" or react in anger. \"Vengeance is mine, sayeth the Lord\" and all that. How does one project this to mean \"Don't resist anything, anytime, for any reason\"?\n \n This raises a question: If you will not resort to violence for any reason, at what point does this refusal become complicity? Refusing to use violence is all well and good, but at some point, you must encounter \"evil\". If you refuse to stop evil people from doing evil things, if you refrain from raising a hand when it is in your power to prevent evil, when does this \"refusal to resort to violence\" become purposefully negligent?\n \n If you don't use ALL means to resist evil, you must draw a line at some point. If you draw the line at the presence of violence, this means you are not using ALL means to resist it. Therefore, at some point, like it or not, your refusal to resist it becomes willful compliance. It becomes purposeful refusal to resist evil, therefore, complicity. \n \n The morality you espouse in your non-violence is completely negated by your willful compliance in your refusal to resist evil. \n \n (read: negated: v [L negatus, to say no] 1: to deny the existence of 2: to cause to be ineffective or invalid syn see NULLIFY - negate, negator, negation)\n \n That's it.

It is still being written your countrymen claim and about as useful as your immagination of scriptural meaning. You call an imminent threat serious enough for someone to produce a weapon in their own home \"brandishing\" and opposed to your misguided sense of morals and ethics?\n \n \nQuite honestly my TV isn't something I'm prepared to kill someone over. The number of burglaries where there is any intent to harm the householder is minimal, and burglary rates are very low compared to what they have been historically. They've risen slightly due to the recession, obviously. In general though, crime rates, including murder, are lower in Britain than they have been for some time.\n\n \n What are those rates Jo? Why would you mention them as proof of your belief in the first place? You can't quote the law from your Constitution and you can't justify your sense of morals by scripture so keep on just keeping on. According to you, the best defense is no defense and you are putting up one mighty struggle emoticon_xclown",

This is why it is illegal to have full auto weapons. Because they are only suitable for mili....huh? Wait a minute.

   "I don't want the police or the public to be engaging in an arms race with criminals. Criminals will always be more willing to use violence, that's why they're criminals.\n\n \n You're grasping for straws. Criminals will never stop seeking ways to have an advantage over others. Either both factions can be armed or one can be. Make up your mind, because criminals have made up theirs. But be aware that criminals don't like armed citizens. They want a victim, not an opponent.\n \n \nNot arming the police means that most criminals don't seek out guns. They know that the penalty for burglary is lower than for carrying a firearm.\n\n \n Either you live in a fantasy world or your government has fed you enough Kool-aid. Criminals won't stop trying to get guns just because everyone else does. They will do whatever they can to have an advantage over others. \n \n BTW, explain to me how it's reasonable for carrying a weapon, which directly causes no problems is worse than burglary, which causes property damage, item and/or money loss, and injury. Don't introduce factors that aren't present, just answer the question.\n \n \nThis means that people don't get hurt as much by crime. Do you want to compare how many people are killed or seriously hurt by criminals in the US as opposed to the UK.\n\n \n More UK government Kool-aid. Millions of crimes are omitted from British statistics annually. And at any rate, I'm optimistic about future US crime rates, as the crime rate in DC has gone down since Heller vs. DC.\n \n As long as Obama doesn't manage to mess up gun polices before everyone realizes what an arse he is and the next president has some reasonable views on gun control, the US crime rate will go down. Just like it did in DC.\n \n \nBesides, in this thread it is not me who is objecting to the US system, but Ethmi who thinks the UK should follow the violent and deadly example of the US system.\n\n \n The police weren't even mentioned until a couple pages ago. But the outcome of Heller vs. DC shows that criminals like unarmed citizens. They want a victim, not a fight.\n \n \nI, and most of my fellow citizens, and the police (they don't want to routinely carry guns either), say no thanks.\n\n \n American police for the most part want to be armed and want citizens to be armed. The reason for that is because we don't live in a fantasy world where criminals care about the penalty of their crime and will magically stop getting guns because everyone else does.\n \n Of course, according to your logic, the more helpless you are, the safer you are from criminals.",

I, and most of my fellow citizens, and the police (they don't want to routinely carry guns either), say no thanks.\n\n \n You really need to sober the hell up and stop being so ignorant and naive about the real world and the workings of the criminal element.\n \n What about the hundreds of thousands of innocent people who have been routinely murdered, no butchered, even though they were unarmed? The millions of jews in Germany, the people in Rwanda, innocent civilians in the midst of the drug war in Mexico, etc. These people were unarmed, by your logic there was no reason that their butchers would be armed and willing to hurt them, and yet they're all dead even though they offered no resistance. Your continual ignorance is disrespectful to their loss.\n \n I'm going to offer you a real-life scenario, JB, one that conflicts with your ideology and beats the **** out of it and you. I suggest considering it very carefully before you present anymore of your P***y pacifist bull****\n \n In 1997, in North Hollywood, California, two individuals by the names of Larry Phillips and Emil Matasareanu were known as the high incident bandits. They wore extensive body armor, they used AK-47s illegally modified for full automatic fire, and they did all this during a time which AK-47s and other similar weapons were supposed to be banned from ownership by the general public.\n \n Phillips and Matasareanu did all of this, during a time when the police were armed with regular handguns and shotguns, all of which were unable to cause any damage through their extensive layers of body armor. These two bandits came in hot and heavy, prepared for a degree of warfare that they'd never experience in California thanks to politics and local laws.\n \n By your logic Phillips and Matasareanu would have never done this. By your logic they should've seen that they had the police outgunned and left the scene peacefully and without a shot fired. But they didn't. Why?",
