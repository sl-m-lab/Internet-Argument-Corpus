The same priest baptizes the child so it doesn't count and that child grows up to become a Bishop. One problem he is an unbaptized bastarx who cannot cause the elevation of the clergy which he does unknowingly. None who are raised by him are truly of God and cannot perform rights themselves.

   "22 Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord. 23 For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. 24 Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.\n \n Let me explain to you EZ why this is a bad idea...\n \n Not all Christian husbands are Christ-like. emoticon_icemoticon_xkillemoticon_xdonno\n I don't need to mention names but, we've seen them in the news, in our neighborhoods and on Internet forums.\n \n And, by your account, they can be murders, abusers of all kinds, liars and low-down and dirty scoundrels - but, if they confess on Sunday, they are forgiven by god and remain 'Christians' throughout the week.\n The trouble with this is that they most likely continue their abuses in the privacy of their own homes and they justify their abuses concerning their wives as being sanctioned by your DITS.\n \n 'By God, you're my wife and you'll do as I say!'\n \n Throw in the martyr complex which says they should endure all pain, suffering and injustices - turn the other cheek (literally) and you have the perfect environment for abuse.\n \n If all men and women were, indeed, like Christ this would not be an issue.\n By saying that all Christian wives should submit to their husbands it is implied that men are superior to women and their judgment is superior - in everything.\n And we all know that this is not always true.emoticon_rolleyes\n \n Another problem with this is that the Christian women who find themselves living with Christian monsters have no biblical means of escape.\n \n We had a local incident where a preachers wife finally got fed up with the abuse and shot him. Oddly, her church stood behind her and she did very little jail time. Personally, I think they should have thrown the book at her - she shot him in the back.\n \n But now she is just another one of those 'Christian' murderers on the list - of course, she has been forgiven and will avoid The Pit simply because she confessed her sin.\n \n What she should have done was gotten a divorce. But, then she most likely would have been black-balled by her church.\n I guess the Christian thing to do is stick with the church at all costs - even murder is acceptable as long as you go to church and confess after. emoticon_frazzled",

They have not only been harmful to women but also to the entire human race by suffocating women's full potential as human beings and prohibiting them from making meaningful, important contributions to the world.\n \n This was written in 1969:\n \n Equal Rights for Women\n HON. SHIRLEY CHISHOLM of New York\n In the House of Representatives, May 21, 1969\n \n Mr. Speaker, when a young woman graduates from college and starts\n looking for a job, she is likely to have a frustrating and even demeaning\n experience ahead of her. If she walks into an office for an interview, the first\n question she will be asked is, \"Do you type?''\n There is a calculated system of prejudice that lies unspoken behind that\n question. Why is it acceptable for women to be secretaries, librarians, and\n teachers, but totally unacceptable for them to be managers, administrators,\n doctors, lawyers, and Members of Congress.\n The unspoken assumption is that women are different. They do not have\n executive ability orderly minds, stability, leadership skills, and they are too\n emotional.\n \n It has been observed before, that society for a long time, discriminated\n against another minority, the blacks, on the same basis - that they were\n different and inferior. The happy little homemaker and the contented \"old\n darkey\" on the plantation were both produced by prejudice.\n As a black person, I am no stranger to race prejudice. But the truth is that in\n the political world I have been far oftener discriminated against because I\n am a woman than because I am black.\n \n Prejudice against blacks is becoming unacceptable although it will take\n years to eliminate it. But it is doomed because, slowly, white America is\n beginning to admit that it exists. Prejudice against women is still acceptable.\n There is very little understanding yet of the immorality involved in double\n pay scales and the classification of most of the better jobs as \"for men only.\"\n More than half of the population of the United States is female. But women\n occupy only 2 percent of the managerial positions. They have not even\n reached the level of tokenism yet No women sit on the AFL-CIO council or\n Supreme Court. There have been only two women who have held Cabinet\n rank, and at present there are none. Only two women now hold\n ambassadorial rank in the diplomatic corps. In Congress, we are down to\n one Senator and 10 Representatives.\n \n Considering that there are about 3 1/2 million more women in the United\n States than men, this situation is outrageous.\n It is true that part of the problem has been that women have not been\n aggressive in demanding their rights. This was also true of the black\n population for many years. They submitted to oppression and even\n cooperated with it. Women have done the same thing. But now there is an\n awareness of this situation particularly among the younger segment of the\n population.\n As in the field of equal rights for blacks, Spanish-Americans, the Indians,\n and other groups, laws will not change such deep-seated problems\n overnight But they can be used to provide protection for those who are most\n abused, and to begin the process of evolutionary change by compelling the\n insensitive majority to reexamine it's unconscious attitudes.\n \n It is for this reason that I wish to introduce today a proposal that has been\n before every Congress for the last 40 years and that sooner or later must\n become part of the basic law of the land -- the equal rights amendment.\n Let me note and try to refute two of the commonest arguments that are\n offered against this amendment. One is that women are already protected\n under the law and do not need legislation. Existing laws are not adequate to\n secure equal rights for women. Sufficient proof of this is the concentration of\n women in lower paying, menial, unrewarding jobs and their incredible\n scarcity in the upper level jobs. If women are already equal, why is it such\n an event whenever one happens to be elected to Congress?\n \n It is obvious that discrimination exists. Women do not have the\n opportunities that men do. And women that do not conform to the system,\n who try to break with the accepted patterns, are stigmatized as ''odd'' and\n \"unfeminine.\" The fact is that a woman who aspires to be chairman of the\n board, or a Member of the House, does so for exactly the same reasons as\n any man. Basically, these are that she thinks she can do the job and she\n wants to try.\n \n A second argument often heard against the equal rights amendment is that is\n would eliminate legislation that many States and the Federal Government\n have enacted giving special protection to women and that it would throw\n the marriage and divorce laws into chaos.\n \n As for the marriage laws, they are due for a sweeping reform, and an\n excellent beginning would be to wipe the existing ones off the books.\n Regarding special protection for working women, I cannot understand why\n it should be needed. Women need no protection that men do not need.\n What we need are laws to protect working people, to guarantee them fair\n pay, safe working conditions, protection against sickness and layoffs, and\n provision for dignified, comfortable retirement. Men and women need these things equally. \n That one sex needs protection more than the other is a male\n supremacist myth as ridiculous and unworthy of respect as the white\n supremacist myths that society is trying to cure itself of at this time.\n \n ...and this is 1971:\n \n At the founding conference of the National Women's Political Caucus, on July 10, 1971, Steinem delivered her Address to the Women of America:\n \n This is no simple reform. It really is a revolution. Sex and race because they are easy and visible differences have been the primary ways of organizing human beings into superior and inferior groups and into the cheap labor on which this system still depends. We are talking about a society in which there will be no roles other than those chosen or those earned. We are really talking about humanism.\n \n ...and it's been over 91 years since the ERA was introduced, asking for equal rights for all, and it still hasn't been approved:\n \n Section 1. Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.\n \n Section 2. The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.\n \n Section 3. This amendment shall take effect two years after the date of ratification.\n \n Thankfully, the times, they are a changing. emoticon_xgood",

But, I'll let you off the hook on this one...if you stop mocking the little girl. Okay? emoticon_xgood\n \n Nope, it's spewing more crud and worse than ever....just like you. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n Now, let's move on to lesson #2:\n \n Wives and Husbands \n \n 22 Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord. 23 For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. 24 Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything. \n \n 25 Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her 26 to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, 27 and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless.\n \n 28 In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. 29 After all, no one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as Christ does the church- 30 for we are members of his body. \n \n 31 \"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.\" 32 This is a profound mystery-but I am talking about Christ and the church. \n 33 However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.\n \n Paul was speaking to the saints of Ephesus.\n If I should happen to meet one, I'll reconsider my opinion of these verses.\n \n In the mean time, you might want to consider this:\n \n \"Day after day they went through the right routines, said the right words, dished out the right spiritual platitudes --- and shriveled a little more inside! As their love for Christ began to wane, they more and more served out of a sense of duty. In their own estimation, their acceptance by the Lord depended on their performance for Him. This opened the door to legalism. Jesus tells the Ephesians to remember that love is the only acceptable motivation for Christian living. He urges them to repent of their loveless Christian duty and to get off their 'works trip,' returning instead to the love which they had when they first came to know Him, when they were flushed with the wonder and excitement of their new relationship with Him\" (Hal Lindsey, p. 46-47). \n \n Assuming that this refers to the second major position above (lack of love for one another), the cause may well be that in their zeal for orthodoxy they had lost the ability to love. \"Perhaps their zeal for orthodoxy in exposing false apostles had developed into a hypocritical, censorious spirit. This would remind us of those in the church today who have developed an unloving, suspicious, fault-finding, hypocritical keeper-of-the-orthodoxy complex\" (James M. Tolle, p. 31). \"Certainly no amount of orthodoxy can make up for a failure to love one another\" (Expositor's Bible Commentary, Vol. 12, p. 434). \n \n Jesus Evaluates Ephesus\n \n So...that means that:\n 21 Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ. is from Christ and the rest is from Paul's warped superiority complex.",

The very simplest idea I've articulated in my work is probably the least understood: There is no one right way for people to live--never has been and never will be. This idea was at the foundation of tribal life everywhere. The Navajo never imagined that they had the right way to live (and that all others were wrong). All they had was a way that suited them. With tribal peoples on all sides of them--all living in different ways--it would have been ridiculous for them to imagine that theirs was the one right way for people to live. It would be like us imagining that there is one right way to orchestrate a Cole Porter song or one right way to make a bicycle. \n \n In the tribal world, because there was complete agreement that no one had the right way to live, there was a staggering glory of cultural diversity, which the people of our culture have been tirelessly eradicating for 10,000 years. For us, it will be paradise when everyone on earth lives exactly the same way. \n \n Almost no one blinks at the statement that there is no one right way for people to live. In one of his denunciations of scribes and pharisees, Jesus said, \"You gag on the gnat but swallow down the camel.\" People find many gnats in my books to gag on, but this great hairy camel goes down as easily as a teaspoon of honey.\n Ishmael.org \n\n \n \"There is no one right way for people to live--never has been and never will be.\" \n \n It might be more fruitful for Humanity to accept the fact that there is no ONE right way for people to live, there is no ONE way to answer questions re: the Gods, there is no ONE way to worship or choose not to worship, etc.\n \n We already have the \"staggering glory of cultural diversity\" part (at least I think we do) - how about agreeing to accept the part about the fact that, \"There is no ONE right way for people to live--never has been and never will be\"?

[/COLOR][/B]\n \n\n \n Glad you appreciated Ishmael.org.\n \n I think you have also hit upon an important point & hitting very close to 'home' to me (no pun intended). I suppose you might say it's an underlying belief supporting many of my other current beliefs regarding this place some of us call 'home.' \n \n I believe the world IS a sacred place.\n \n I believe this IS our home (albeit a temporary one).\n \n I like to practice Tai Chi Chuan. I read this book when I first started studying/practicing. Perhaps there are some parallels? This from the book: \n \n \n\"A person with an excellent sense of K'e Ch'I will be very good at Tai Chi Chuan.\" -Robert W. Smith (student of Professor Cheng) \n \n K'e Ch'i means \"manners,\" that characteristic of the Chinese that can be graceful when sincere & annoying when an empty formality. The etymology of the phrase is revealing, K'e means guest. Ch'i is the same word - breath, air, spirit force - that is the center of Tai Chi. So taken together, K'e Ch'i is the \"the air of a guest.\" \n \n Think of being a guest of the earth. Grateful, glad to be in this lovely house, respectful of everything, which is, after all, not yours; but not subservient either, secure that your presence is welcome & provided for by a beneficent universe. \n \n In doing push hands our attitude should also be K'e Ch'i. We should not try to dominate or overpower the opponent. Professor Cheng said that if your idea is to push or not be pushed, it is not Tai Chi. \n \n -From There Are No Secrets Professor Cheng Man-ch'ing & his Tai Chi Chuan by Wolfe Lowenthal \n\n \n I was fortunate to have two very good teachers, from the one teacher I learned more about the form, from the other I learned more about 'push hands'. \n \n \n\"Do push hands as if no one is there, do the form as if someone is there.\" -Professor Cheng \n \n In the absence of harmony, apply the principle of push hands; we don't look to blame the other, we look to ourselves. We also need to understand that separation & its attendant negative emotions are not to be indulged; that is a sign we are out of balance & if not corrected will lead to even worse trouble. The organism, healthy & in balance, is meant to be \"happy as a fish in crystal waters.\" \n \n Martial ability in Tai Chi develops through osmosis. Correct &, as Professor Cheng would say, \"sincere\" practice of the form & push hands produces a body wisdom, an instinctual power that when initially emergent surprises the practitioner.\n\n \n I have found it necessary (for me) to further develop my 'body wisdom' & to work on my sense of balance. \n \n Rather than considering the time we spend here as being stuck in some sortof 'waiting room' - Rather than being willing or unwilling participants in some sortof cosmic battle or conspiracy between forces - Maybe we are all more like 'guests of the Earth'? After all we're here for such a very short time. Maybe we could even work towards 'being happy as fishes in crystal waters?\" That sure would be nice. \n \n Different strokes for different folks & different wishes for different fishes. \n \n \u0095'\u00af`\u0095.. <<((((\u00ba< \u0095'\u00af`\u0095... <<((((\u00ba< \u0095'\u00af`\u0095.. <<((((\u00ba<",

I like to apply what I learn, test it out, see what it feels like, etc. It's a kindof joy for me.\n \n I came back 'cuz I thought of another association from that quote:\n \n \nFor Christians, the world is not where humans belong; it's not our true home, it's just a sort of waiting room where we pass the time before moving on to our true home, which is heaven. For Buddhists, the world is another kind of waiting room, which we visit again and again in a repeating cycle of death and rebirth until we finally attain liberation in nirvana. \n \n For Christians, if the world were a sacred place, we wouldn't belong in it, because we're all sinners; God didn't send his only-begotten son to make us worthy of living in a sacred world but to make us worthy of living with God in heaven. For Buddhists, if the world were a sacred place, then why would we hope to escape it? If the world were a sacred place, then would we not rather welcome the repeating cycle of death and rebirth? \n ...\n From the animist point of view, humans belong in a sacred place because they themselves are sacred. Not sacred in a special way, not more sacred than anything else, but merely as sacred as anything else--as sacred as bison or salmon or crows or crickets or bears or sunflowers.\n Ishmael.org\n\n \n O'course if you can get close to accepting the premise listed above, you will begin to question the direction the USA is heading in re: separation of religion & state.\n \n In a free, open, secular society, people are free to express their religious views & practice religion as they please. Secularism permits or demands tolerance of all religious views & doesn't give preference to 1 belief system over another. Related to this concept, in a secular society, in order to protect the religious views of all, there would necessarily need to be a separation between religion & state. What I think this means is that the state, in making decisions, would take into account religious views in its decision making processes. Like any other special interests group. What it doesn't mean is to show privilege to 1 group over another. Each group, if they wished to be considered in this decision-making process would present their views based on critical thinking, reasoning & rational thought (a bonus - this would conveniently exclude the lunatic fringe). An example of giving privilege to 1 group over another is some of the \"relic\" laws, still on the books, which show favoritism and oppose the \"no religious test\" in the United States Constitution, Article VI, section 3:\n \n \n...no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.\n \n ... But religion can be useful to man only when it is pure. The constitution of the United States has, therefore, wisely provided that it should never be united with the state. \n Art. 6, 3. Vide Christianity; Religious test; Theocracy.\n\n \n \nThis has been interpreted to mean that no federal employee, whether elected or appointed, \"career\" or \"political,\" can be required to adhere to or accept any religion or belief. This clause immediately follows one requiring all federal and state officers to take an oath of support to the Constitution. This implies that the requirement of an oath, even presumably one taken \"So help me God\" (not a part of the presidential oath, the only one spelled out in the Constitution, but traditionally almost always added to it), does not imply any requirement by those so sworn to accept a particular religion or a particular doctrine.\n \n The clause is cited by advocates of separation of church and state as an example of \"original intent\" of the Framers of the Constitution of avoiding any entanglement between church and state, or involving the government in any way as a determiner of religious beliefs or practices. This is important as this clause represents the words of the original Framers, even prior to the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.\n \n State law\n Earlier in U.S. history, the doctrine of states' rights allowed individual states to choose not to have this provision in their state constitutions or even to have an opposite provision; such provisions have by extension in recent decades been deemed to be unconstitutional by the extension of the First Amendment provisions to the states (via the incorporation of the 14th Amendment).\n \n Six states, however, have language included in their Bill of Rights, Declaration of Rights, or in the body of their constitutions that require state office-holders to have particular religious beliefs. These states are Texas, Massachusetts, Maryland, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee. The required beliefs include belief in a Supreme Being, and belief in a future state of rewards and punishments. Some of these same states specify that the oath of office include the words \"so help me God.\" In some cases these beliefs (or oaths) were historically required also of jurors, witnesses in court, notaries public, and state employees. While these laws are often regarded as relics, if it became known that a non-believer was elected to office, there is the possibility of a court challenge over eligibility. In 1961, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that such language in state constitutions was in violation of Article VI of the U.S. Constitution in Torcaso v. Watkins. In 1997 the South Carolina Supreme Court ruled that the state constitution requiring an oath to God for employment in the public sector was unconstitutional.\n Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\n \n The willful ignorance allowing these relic laws to continue perpetuates the false perception the USA is progressing toward a more open & free society/culture where people are free to express their religious views, practice religion, worship their Gods as they please & so on.\n \n I think it's a bit problematic or worrisome when certain states have laws requiring state office-holders to have \"required beliefs including belief in a Supreme Being, and belief in a future state of rewards and punishments.\" Some of these laws would exclude not only people who choose not to have a belief in one or more of the Gods, but would exclude people whose belief system or practice of religion does not include the concept of the 'world as waiting room.' \n \n (I like that guy's (sometimes funny) use of metaphors but am not really interested in getting into this particular discussion - bowing out of this one & apologies for dragging off-topic?)",

Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.\"\n \n 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 - \"Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.\"\n \n 1 Timothy 1:8-10 - &#8220;But we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully, knowing this: that the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine&#8230;&#8221;\n \n Jude 7 &#8211; &#8220;In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire.&#8221; \n \n There's no gay marriages in the Old Testament; No gay marriages in the New Testament; no gay sex approved anywhere in the Bible. Just the opposite - gay sex is condemned in both testaments. God is consistent on that.\n \n And to close:\n \n &#8220;Whosoever shall be guilty of Rape, Polygamy, or Sodomy with man or woman shall be punished, if a man, by castration, if a woman, by cutting thro' the cartilage of her nose a hole of one half inch diameter at the least.&#8221; - Thomas Jefferson, A Bill for Proportioning Crimes and Punishments\n \n Clear as a bell, but not one reprobate left wing radical can see it.

(One of ez's favorite subject), and it has been suggested that is specifically dealing with the humiliation rape that used to go on.\n \n When you look at the various letters of Paul in the original Greek, and in context, you will see that 'homosexuality' is not mentioned.. but it is likely to be referring to the practice that was common of men having sex with adolescent boys, and vague references to 'sexual immorality' without defining what that immorality is.\n \n Yes, the modern translations make it very clear that modern thought is against homosexuality. Modern Jewish orthodox feel homosexuality is wrong also. They are not as obsessed about it as the Christian fundies by a large part\n \n It is interesting to note that in the OT, there isn't any prohibition on lesbian sex., just man on man.",

   "Hogwash. Calling the backslidden homosexual community to repentance isn't hate speech. As usual, you let your reprobate, illicit pro gay agenda cloud your thinking.\n \n Let's review why gay sex is a sin and a perversion in the Bible:\n \n Leviticus 18:22 - \"Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable.\" \n \n Leviticus 20:13 - \"If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.\"\n \n Romans 1:26-27 - \"Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.\"\n \n 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 - \"Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.\"\n \n 1 Timothy 1:8-10 - \"But we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully, knowing this: that the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine...\"\n \n Jude 7 - \"In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire.\" \n \n There's no gay marriages in the Old Testament; No gay marriages in the New Testament; no gay sex approved anywhere in the Bible. Just the opposite - gay sex is condemned in both testaments. God is consistent on that.\n \n And to close:\n \n \"Whosoever shall be guilty of Rape, Polygamy, or Sodomy with man or woman shall be punished, if a man, by castration, if a woman, by cutting thro' the cartilage of her nose a hole of one half inch diameter at the least.\" - Thomas Jefferson, A Bill for Proportioning Crimes and Punishments\n \n Clear as a bell, but not one reprobate left wing radical can see it. Astonishing!\n\n \n Clear becuae you choose to be ignorant of the truth. I don't care if you think homosexuals are bad. It is a free county and that is within your rights. I don't care that you use the Bible to justify your reasoning again you can believe whatever you want. I have a problem with you and others using the Bible as fact to justify your position. The fact is that what is printed today is not what was printed a few hundred years ago nor a thousand years ago and nobody knows what was originally printed. Examples of my point are below\n \n Wyclif 1395\n \n Leviticus 18:22\n 22 Thou schalt not be medlid with a man bi letcherie of womman, for it is abhomynacioun.\n \n The evolution of letcherie\n \n Middle English 1395 Wyclif Ye han herd that it was seid to elde men, Thou schalt `do no letcherie.\n Renaissance English 1526 Tyndale Ye haue hearde howe it was sayde to the of olde tyme: Thou shalt not comitt advoutrie.\n Jacobean English 1611 King James Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery\n Victorian English 1833 Webster Ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery\n Basic English 1964 Ogden You have knowledge that it was said, You may not have connection with another man's wife\n \n Letchery became adultry a lechor became a fornicator\n \n Middle English 1395 Wyclif I wroot to you in a pistle, that ye be not medlid with letchours,\n Renaissance English 1526 Tyndale I wrote vnto you in a pistle that ye shuld not company with fornicatours.\n Jacobean English 1611 King James I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:\n Victorian English 1833 Webster I have written to you in this epistle, not to associate with persons guilty of lewdness:\n Basic English 1964 Ogden In my letter I said to you that you were not to keep company with those who go after the desires of the flesh;\n \n But what is the original meaning of the word\n \n The origin of the word derives from Latin. The word fornix means \"an archway\" or \"vault\" and it became a common euphemism for a brothel as prostitutes could be solicited in the vaults beneath Rome. More directly, fornicatio means \"done in the archway\"; thus it originally referred to prostitution. The first recorded use of the noun in its modern meaning was in 1303 AD, with the verb fornicate first recorded around 250 years later.[3]\n Fornication in every form of it was sternly condemned by the Mosaic law (Lev. 21:9; 19:29; Deut. 22:20, 21, 23-29; 23:18; Ex. 22:16). (See ADULTERY.) But this word is more frequently used in a symbolical than in its ordinary sense. It frequently means a forsaking of God or a following after idols (Isa. 1:2; Jer. 2:20; Ezek. 16; Hos. 1:2; 2:1-5; Jer. 3:8,9).

   "Not quite sure constructing a new religion is a workable solution? Although I'd be willing to give it a go - it would have to better than our current ways!\n \n What might be more workable is deconstructing our present day belief systems? :)\n \n Beliefs have a way of creating behaviors. I would say belief is more closely related to the idea of perception. Any long term change in behavior results from a change in the underlying beliefs supporting the behavior. Focusing on the behavior without changing the underlying beliefs either fails or only succeeds in short term change. \n \n Reason exists in thought. Thoughts are based on beliefs. If you're trying to change behavior, you're more likely to succeed if you give reason. The easiest (perhaps quickest) way to give a reason is to base that reason on a belief. \n \n & if you can offer a belief that sponsors or supports the change in behavior or action? \n \n Case in point: historically, most wars have been fought along these chains of thought. I use the words 'chains' on purpose because humanity seems to have become imprisoned by thinking solely along these lines, 'chaining our thoughts' to convince ourselves (& our warriors) that force & violence alone can be used to solve problems. Then (& especially) when religious beliefs are used to legitimize the proposition? SNAFU. \n \n It doesn't appear that problems can be solved at the level of behavior. More likely is that problems are solved at the level of belief. \n \n People can & will do whatever they want to seek to change behavior (please see all of history). The point is, if the beliefs that support the action do not change, nothing is altered although something (action) might be temporarily halted. Beliefs tend to be changed in two ways, either they are enlarged upon or they are changed completely. If beliefs do not change in either one of these ways, the behavior is merely interrupted. \n \n History rhymes. \n \n \n \n \"There is no one right way for people to live--never has been and never will be.\" \n \n It might be more fruitful for Humanity to accept the fact that there is no ONE right way for people to live, there is no ONE way to answer questions re: the Gods, there is no ONE way to worship or choose not to worship, etc.\n \n We already have the \"staggering glory of cultural diversity\" part (at least I think we do) - how about agreeing to accept the part about the fact that, \"There is no ONE right way for people to live--never has been and never will be\"? \n\n \n what a lot of tripe emoticon_frazzled",

   "Yes it is clear, and I commend you for at least acknowledging the obvious and letting the chips fall where they may. There seems to be a movement out there to \"reinterpret\" the Bible in different ways from what it clearly says. No doubt for the religious gay person with conflicted interests and feelings, it's a difficult issue. It is so for those who don't like seeing their sacred scriptures defied in a blatant way, as well. \n \n The examples you give in comparison don't measure up to the same-gender sex issue however. I believe both examples you give are from the Judaic OT legal code, of which Christianity was a change. When it comes to same-gender sex however, both the Old and New Testaments are clear on this moralistic issue.\n\n \n So here we come to Leviticus 20:13 there is no reinterpreting that it plainly says that gay people should be put to death.

All these years liberalism has failed (or so they say) because all these factors were not present at the same time. Well, now is their time. All the players are in place. As Oprah said, mmm-mmm-mmm Obama is \"THE ONE.\" HE IS THE ANOINTED ONE, and He will usher in real prosperity, heal the land, bring America and the world together, bring the troops home, close Guantanamo, etc., etc. He's the man!

Unemployment is still hovering around 10%. Unemployment amongst blacks is worse. WHAT A HERO!! Cities and states are in or close to bankruptcy. Obama has managed to alienate or offend even our closest allies (Britain, Israel). The liberals in Europe (\"Oh, we should be more like the Europeans,\" the liberals say) are now the conservative ones telling Obama to quit his drunken sailor spending. The deficit is out of sight and growing daily. The \"Stimulus\" was an enormous disaster. The majority of Americans can't stand Obama's health care bill. Don't Ask Don't Tell is still in effect. The gay radicals are incensed. Even the Greenies are steamed - the Gulf is an ecological disaster and the messiah can't plug the friggin' hole if his life depended on it. Iran is getting the Bomb in spite of Obama's \"Neville Chamberlain\" hot air speeches about not letting that happen. The stock market took another dive, and housing starts are in the commode as well. And that's just the beginning of their sorrows.\n \n Folks, liberalism doesn't work. The heathens wind up in hell and the country goes down the toilet. No wonder the liberal left is upset, depressed and incensed. Their grand utopian dream is in the crapper, and they don't know how to fix it. \n \n And come November, their time is up.\n \n emoticon_xbouncer",

How can I be anti-christ when I don't believe in christ (as claimed in the bible) to begin with? I am not quite sure how one can be opposed to something that they do not first believe is real. That's your issue to sort out, I could care less.\n \n I could care less what you believe, and I feel that you should be free to believe in whatever or whoever you want. What I do object to is how you use your personal religious beliefs to place yourself in a self-perceived place of superiority, and how you find it acceptable in your mind to foist your personal beliefs on others. \n \n Do you know what a bigot really is?\n \n Bigot:\n &#8211;noun \n a person who is utterly intolerant of any differing creed, belief, or opinion. \n \n In other words...you. You are a bigot, and it has been seen time and time again by everyone here. Yet you have the audacity to call me a bigot, and then when I press you to back up your words, you run like a scared child. \n \n I can tolerate your creed, beliefs, and opinions. What I can not tolerate is you attempting to tell me what my creed, beliefs, or opinions are or what they should be. \n \n Matthew 7:1-6 -Some great advice for you.",

Being one in essence with the fundamental of the Great purity he moves in the realm of the formless. \n \n He does not pollute the essence, nor abuse the spirit, i.e., he does not sully the pristine element of life nor waste the energies of the spirit. The soul is a hving part of a whole universe, and is placed in an environment of great clarity. Therefore he does not dream during his sleep: the intelligence is not dimmed; the spirit maintaining its own unity, his knowledge is not mixed with scheming concepts. The animal spirits are not depressed nor is the spirit too buoyant. His activities and movements, from first to last, are of a homogeneity. Closing the eyes on the world of sense, he lives in the abstruse realms of the Tao, yet he sees as though he were in a house full of light. \n \n Reposing in this ideal realm (not in the crooked ways of schemes) he takes his flight into regions of formless space. Living in regions that could not be visualized, roaming without a fixed location, his movements have no vestiges, his tranquility no substance. In being, he is as one lost, living, he is as one dead: he can go in and out through the impenetrable; the ghosts of the dead and of the divinities are his ministers. He probes into the unfathomable, he penetrates into the unspatial since the Tao transmits the varied forms. The beginning and end are as a circle, so others can't find the truth.

   "\"... atheism is not a crutch. Not to say that atheist can't have a crutch, just as Christians, agnostics, Buddhists, Muslims and devil-worshipers can.\n\n \n I say it is to more than a few atheists. There's probably quite a few atheists who embrace atheism so they wont have to repent and turn from their wicked ways. Not only that, but they use atheism to deceive themselves from coming to grips with the realization that they're going to hell when they die.\n \n One other thing - you say Christianity wouldn't hold up in a court of law. That's nonsense. \n \n If ever there was an expert in court testimony and eyewitness accounts of criminal evidence for a felony trial, it was Dr. Simon Greenleaf, an American attorney and jurist (1783-1853). Dr. Greenleaf saw the multiple eye-witness accounts of Jesus and His death and resurrection as so concrete and credible as to still, today, be considered admissible evidence fit for a court of law. [1] He concluded that the testimonies recorded in the New Testament, would be considered as valid today as they were then by a jury. He did not consider their testimony as &#8220;third party&#8221; or as &#8220;hear say&#8221;, but a large enough number of real people who were really there.

   "I say it is to more than a few atheists. There's probably quite a few atheists who embrace atheism so they wont have to repent and turn from their wicked ways. Not only that, but they use atheism to deceive themselves from coming to grips with the realization that they're going to hell when they die.\n This doesn't make any sense. Are you suggesting that some atheists are just pretending to be atheists?emoticon_wow That doesn't make any sense at all. If a 'pretending' atheist 'realized' they might go to hell, that would mean they believed in hell and weren't atheists at all. Do you personally know anyone like this??? I don't. If they actually believed in hell, it would be much easier to ask for forgiveness than to pretend to be an atheist.emoticon_frazzled\n \n \nOne other thing - you say Christianity wouldn't hold up in a court of law. That's nonsense. \n \n If ever there was an expert in court testimony and eyewitness accounts of criminal evidence for a felony trial, it was Dr. Simon Greenleaf, an American attorney and jurist (1783-1853). Dr. Greenleaf saw the multiple eye-witness accounts of Jesus and His death and resurrection as so concrete and credible as to still, today, be considered admissible evidence fit for a court of law. [1] He concluded that the testimonies recorded in the New Testament, would be considered as valid today as they were then by a jury. He did not consider their testimony as \"third party\" or as \"hear say\", but a large enough number of real people who were really there. It is hard to fathom that this was done before such a large audience and that they were all deceived at the same time.\n \n In any court of law, it only takes two or three witnesses to convince a jury of a guilty verdict, but with hundreds of eye witnesses providing such a strong, supportive written testimony, it is incongruous that all of these testimonies would thrown out of a court trial. The fact is that these testimonies meet or exceeded evidential requirements so strongly that Dr. Greenleaf even saw the martyrdoms, exponential church growth and the persistent-through-persecution faith of the believers (often, even up to death), also as the most consequential evidence that could possible exist.

The more logical explanation would be that one of his followers collected the body in secret to perpetuate the story. Achim's Razor.\n\n \n You haven't studied this much, have you? Here's what you have to buy into to believe that theory (for which there is ZERO EVIDENCE, by the way. Whatever happened to your \"Hold up in a court of law\" standard?).\n \n The Disciples stole Jesus' body and faked His resurrection???\n \n This possibility has been raised by critics ever since Jesus rose from the dead. But it has never taken root except in some Jewish circles because the New Testament account does not support a faked resurrection theory. Nevertheless, in order for the disciples to have faked the resurrection of Jesus, several conditions must have been met. Let's take a look at them and analyze them.\n \n The disciples would need to concoct an elaborate plan. \n \n You can't just walk to a tomb guarded by Roman soldiers and ask for Jesus' body. So, in order to fake Jesus' resurrection the disciples would have to obtain and dispose of the body of Jesus without any hostile witnesses seeing them do this. This would mean that the guards in front of Jesus' tomb would need to be bribed (discussed later). It would further mean that several people would have to be involved in carrying the body of Jesus to an area where it could receive proper disposal. A single person would not be able to carry another human body a long distance. Therefore, these several people would have to agree to steal the body of Jesus and risk arrest by the guards and the Jewish leaders. \n \n Furthermore, this plan would also have to include other people outside the circle of the disciples since such an \"impossible\" occurrence as a resurrection would be more convincing if others who were not biased followers of Jesus said that they saw Jesus after the crucifixion. This means that the disciples would have to convince a lot of people to go against the Jewish religious leaders, thereby risking their own economic and social security, as well as risk bringing conflict into the region since the Jews who sent Jesus to the cross could easily persecute these new apparent converts. Additionally, this would bring further attention of the Romans to the issue thereby escalating tension which was not something the Jewish people wanted. \n \n One more thing, it would be very obvious to the disciples that to continue claiming Jesus rose from the dead would bring the harsh attention of the religious leaders upon them. Remember, the Jewish leaders knew who Jesus' disciples were. Therefore, attention could be focused on them in the form of persecution. Unlike others, the disciples would be easy targets. Since the Jewish leaders had just sentenced Jesus to die a horrible death on the cross, what would stop them from continuing with the disciples who would then start proclaiming Jesus had risen from the dead? The disciples had to know what they were getting into. They were risking their families and their own lives. \n \n In all, concocting an elaborate plan to deceive many people has too many difficult variables in it to overcome. (IT\"S NOT OCCAM'S RAZOR, Sandy) It would simply make more sense to assert that the reason the disciples proclaimed the resurrection of Jesus is because they actually saw the resurrected Jesus. \n \n A sufficient motive would have to be offered to account for the disciples' intended deception.\n \n Remember, we have many people in the Bible who said that Jesus rose from the dead. Did these people all agree to lie? If so, why would they do that? What would motivate various people, who have differences of opinions, differences in needs and desires, to agree together to testify to something false? Could it be that they were dissatisfied with the Roman Empire ruling over the Jewish nation? But what would they accomplish by proclaiming Jesus' resurrection? Did they think that the Roman Empire would suddenly leave Israel because of that? Not a chance. \n \n Or perhaps the people were tired of the hypocrisy of the Jewish religious leaders and it motivated them to claim Jesus rose from the dead in order to undermine their authority. But if this is the case then we have an inconsistency between motive and behavior because people who would be upset with someone else's hypocrisy are not likely to proclaim such an incredible lie as a resurrection -- thereby being even bigger hypocrites than the leaders. Does this make sense? Also, since Jesus taught love, truth, and self sacrifice, such deceptive actions would be in direct contradiction with the teachings of the One they were following. \n \n At best all anyone can do is guess about what the disciples may have been thinking or what might have motivated them to devise an elaborate deception. Guessing is all that can be done. But we would need to ask if any proposed motives of the disciples could be harmonized with the facts of their preaching and teaching about truth, long-suffering, patience, kindness, and love. No one can read their hearts or their minds and insert into a scenario 2000 years old the motivations of people long gone. It is simply best to let the facts speak for themselves. They lived, suffered, proclaimed, and died for the truth of the resurrection. \n \n The guards at the tomb would need to be bribed. \n \n The problem of bribing works both ways. The disciples could have bribed the guards not to say anything about them taking the body of Jesus. But, the Jews could also have bribed the guards into saying that the disciples stole the body of Jesus. In fact, the only bribing we see in the gospel accounts of the guards is done by the Jewish leaders. Matt. 28:11-15 says, \"Now while they were on their way, behold, some of the guard came into the city and reported to the chief priests all that had happened. 12 And when they had assembled with the elders and counseled together, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers, 13 and said, \"You are to say, &#8216;His disciples came by night and stole Him away while we were asleep.&#8217; 14 \"And if this should come to the governor&#8217;s ears, we will win him over and keep you out of trouble.\" 15 And they took the money and did as they had been instructed; and this story was widely spread among the Jews, and is to this day.\" \n \n The bribe would be very necessary since the guards were at risk of their lives if they had failed at their duty. It was the custom of the Roman military that if a prisoner escaped, then the guard(s) in charge of guarding the prisoner would take the prisoner's place. This is a very strong motivation to make sure that they carried out their duty, bribe or not. In Acts 16:25-30 when Paul was in prison, there was an earthquake that opened the cell doors which would have allowed the prisoners to escape. When the jailor saw this he intended to kill himself. Undoubtedly, this is because he knew he would have to take their place should they escape. But Paul called out and said in verse 28,\"Do yourself no harm, for we are all here!\" This shows that the guard did not want to take the place of the prisoners. In fact, in Acts 12:18-19 we read of how Herod ordered guards to be executed who had allowed Peter to escape. \n \n Therefore, for the guards to risk their lives, a large bribe would be necessary. Who was more likely to have enough money to bribe the guards, the religious leaders or the disciples?  Also, who had a greater motive, the disciples who wanted to have Jesus rise from the dead (risking further persecution), or the Jews who wanted to complete their attempt to be rid of Jesus? \n \n The body of Christ would need to be disposed of to prevent disproof of his resurrection. \n \n If the scenario of an elaborate plan with bribed guards and collusion on the part of many non-followers of Jesus were to be effective, the body of Jesus would need proper disposal. If the disciples could get a hold of His body and get away from the population, it would not be difficult at all to bury it someplace. It would then be necessary that the disciples promise that they would never disclose the location. This is a possibility but it would mean that the disciples were liars and thieves. Is this basis for their faith consistent with their writings about truth, honesty, etc., combined with their dedication to their assertion of Jesus' resurrection that cost them their lives? \n Various witnesses would need to be arranged.\n \n As I have already stated above, many people would need to be coached into lying about seeing the risen Lord. Is this probable for so many Jews who grew up under the idea that lying was a sin? Perhaps. But, is it easy to convince people to lie about an event that they know would bring them economic, familial, social, and religious difficulties? The answer, of course, is no it is not. The Jewish people were living under Roman rule. The Romans served both as oppressors and protectors. They were oppressors and they forced many of their own rules upon the Jewish people. On the other hand, they protected the land of Israel from hostile nations surrounding them. Friction in the region is not something people would want to have, especially if they have families with children and parents to take care of and to love. Does it really make sense that so many people would agree to such a great lie for such a great consequence? \n \n The Disciples stole Jesus' body and faked His resurrection. | Christian Apologetics and Research Ministry\n \n NOT OCCAM'S RAZOR.\n \n However, at least you're trying to come up with something to explain the empty tomb.

   "Well thought out, informative reply!emoticon_xgood \n Unfortunately, you've done more to reinforce my opinion than to dissolve it.\n One thing struck me more than all the rest: you are counting on honorable behavior from the disciples and the guards. According to other bible stories, and the 'fact' that humans are born with 'sinful natures', I don't think we can count on them behaving the way we would expect them to.\n \n 'If the disciples could get a hold of His body and get away from the population, it would not be difficult at all to bury it someplace.

Is this basis for their faith consistent with their writings about truth, honesty, etc., combined with their dedication to their assertion of Jesus' resurrection that cost them their lives?'\n \n So, if we can prove that the disciples didn't always behave as disciples should, then we can prove that it is entirely possible there was conspiracy involved, right?\n Let's see, wasn't there one who betrayed JC with a kiss? And, wasn't there another who doubted him?

   "Well thought out, informative reply!emoticon_xgood \n\n \n Well, you liked CARM, and that's a CARM response.\n \n \n\n Unfortunately, you've done more to reinforce my opinion than to dissolve it.\n One thing struck me more than all the rest: you are counting on honorable behavior from the disciples and the guards. According to other bible stories, and the 'fact' that humans are born with 'sinful natures', I don't think we can count on them behaving the way we would expect them to.\n\n \n Once again, let me reinforce the fact that you have zero evidence for your theory. Correct?\n \n It doesn't match the facts of what was reported by multiple sources. Secondly, now you're saying they were all liars?\n \n \n 'If the disciples could get a hold of His body and get away from the population, it would not be difficult at all to bury it someplace. It would then be necessary that the disciples promise that they would never disclose the location. This is a possibility but it would mean that the disciples were liars and thieves. Is this basis for their faith consistent with their writings about truth, honesty, etc., combined with their dedication to their assertion of Jesus' resurrection that cost them their lives?'\n \n So, if we can prove that the disciples didn't always behave as disciples should, then we can prove that it is entirely possible there was conspiracy involved, right?\n\n \n You'd have a very difficult hill to climb to make that stick. \n \n \nLet's see, wasn't there one who betrayed JC with a kiss? And, wasn't there another who doubted him? And, what about the one who fell asleep during the watch?\n I think that proves that the disciples were not quite up to the task assigned to them and were very capable of deceit...and didn't always practice what JC preached.\n\n \n Liberals love their conspiracy theories. So now you're trying to sell the idea of a massive conspiracy involving all the disciples, the guards, and all the rest of the people who saw him alive after his death? And all those disciples decided to suffer, even to death at the hands of the religious community, etc., for their lie? Do you know how bizarre that sounds? \n \n It doesn't match the historical accounts and it's bizarre.\n \n Do you believe 9/11 was an inside job?",

Correct?\n It doesn't match the facts of what was reported by multiple sources. Secondly, now you're saying they were all liars?\n You'd have a very difficult hill to climb to make that stick. \n Not correct.

Do you know how bizarre that sounds? \n It doesn't match the historical accounts and it's bizarre.\n I did not say 'All' of them were involved but, it entirely possible and most likely probable that some of them had their own agenda and motives that were not in line with those of JC. Some were lemmings that just went with the flow.\n \n And, since you mention it, it does compare to a modern day conspiracy: Water fluoridation...the majority believe the lie - 'even to death' at the hands of the government and the medical profession.\n People have been fed the lie for so long that they can't handle the truth. Even when shown firm evidence that it is a lie, they find it easier to continue to believe the lie than to face the truth that they have been lied to by people they have trusted to tell the truth (Uncle Sam, doctors, dentists, government agencies, etc...). Not only that but, the substance of the lie (fluoride) physically and mentally prevents them for recognizing the truth when it is presented to them.\n Organized religion is no different...and it doesn't take much imagination to see that it could have been true regarding the resurrection. Rather than recognize the truth, they perpetuated the deception. \n And, as for 'the facts of what was reported by multiple sources', that means zilch. Look at Google. You can find plenty of 'facts' reported by multiple sources but, that does not mean they are all true.\n \n \nDo you believe 9/11 was an inside job?\n Absolutely. Don't you?",

I think people would be content too if they simply accepted who and what they are and make the most of what they have to work with.\n \n Setting the bar too high, like trying to live up to the expectations of an imaginary super being, only sets the the stage for disappointment and failure.\n Trying to be a caring, compassionate 'do unto others' kind of human is a much more realistic goal.\n \n I don't know if I have found 'The' truth but, I have found the truth that works for me.

   "He wouldn't take half the heat if he just bothered to spend the time to know what he is talking about. I have seen Christians tear up atheists because they had a better understanding of the religion and could express those views clearly. \n \n\n \n Once again, you can't discern the truth when it's presented to you (1 Corinthians 2:14). \n \n So let's get the main points on record that are the foundations of my beliefs and those of a representative church:\n \n From: Crosstimberschurch.org| Beliefs\n \n What I / we believe&#8230;\n \n &#8230; that there is ONE LIVING AND TRUE GOD, eternally existing in three persons the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit &#8211; equal in power and glory, and that this triune God created all, upholds all, and governs all. (Matthew 28:19, Isaiah 40:12-26, Isaiah 46:8-11)\n \n &#8230; that the SCRIPTURES of the Old and New Testaments are the Word of God, fully inspired, to be interpreted according to their context and purpose in reverent obedience to the Lord, Who speaks through them in living power. (2 Timothy 3:14-17, Romans 15:4, James 1:22)\n \n &#8230; in GOD THE FATHER, an infinite, personal God, perfect in holiness, wisdom, power and love; that He concerns Himself mercifully in the affairs of men; that He hears and answers prayer; and that He saves from sin and death all who come to Him through Jesus Christ. (Matthew 6:9, Isaiah 6:3, Romans 11:33-39, Psalms 138:5-6, Matthew 7:11, Isaiah 55:6-7)\n \n &#8230; in JESUS CHRIST, God&#8217;s only begotten Son, conceived by the Holy Spirit. We believe in His virgin birth, sinless life, miracles and teachings, His atoning death, bodily resurrection, ascension into heaven, perpetual intercession for His people, and personal, visible return to earth. We believe that, in His first coming, Jesus inaugurated the fulfillment of the Kingdom of God (John 11:14-18, Luke 1:18-20, Hebrews 4:15, Romans 5:8, 1 Corinthians 15:1-8, Ephesians 1:20, 1 Thessalonians 4:16, Mark 1:14-15)\n \n &#8230; in the HOLY SPIRIT, Who came forth from the Father and Son to convict the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment, and to regenerate, sanctify and empower for ministry all who believe in Christ. We believe the Holy Spirit indwells every believer in Jesus Christ and that He is an abiding Helper, Teacher and Guide. We believe in the present ministry of the Holy Spirit and in the exercise of all the Biblical gifts of the Spirit. (John 15:26, John 16:8, Titus 3:5, Acts 1:8, Romans 8:9, Ephesians 1:13, John 14:16, 1 Corinthians 12:4-11)\n \n &#8230; that all MEN are sinners by nature and choice and are therefore without Christ; that God regenerates and baptizes by the Holy Spirit those who repent of their sins and confess Jesus Christ as Lord. (Ephesians 2:1-10, Acts 2:38, Ezekiel 36:26, John 1:12-13, John 10:9)\n \n &#8230; in the universal CHURCH, the living spiritual body, of which Christ is the Head and all regenerated persons are members. (1 Corinthians 12:12-13, Ephesians 2:19-22, 1 Peter 2:4-5)\n \n &#8230; that the Lord Jesus Christ committed two ORDINANCES to the Church: Baptism and the Lord&#8217;s Supper. We believe in water baptism and communion open to all believers. (Acts 2:38, 1 Corinthians 11:23-30, Luke 3:3)\n \n &#8230; in the personal, visible APPEARING OF CHRIST to earth and the consummation of His Kingdom and in the resurrection of the body, the final judgment and eternal blessing of the righteous and eternal punishment of the wicked. (Acts 1:11, Matthew 25:31, 1 Corinthians 15:20-24, Revelation 20:11, Revelation 21:8).\n \n Now which one(s) of these do you claim are inconsistent with the Bible?",

Curiosity causes us to desire and allowing unfulfilled desires to fade away instead of clinging to them, is important for growth and being able to move on to the next desire.

   "Protection of the people should take priority over social programs for illegal aliens, excessive retirement benefits for the unions, etc.\n\n I don't support social programs for illegal aliens. I support deporting illegal aliens and then giving them the opportunity to come to this country legally. But I do believe Americans have a right to social assistance when they need it. \n \n \nAnd when the burglar is stealing your computer and frightening the hell out of your wife and daughter, then how are you going to act? \n\n I would call the cops to report a robbery in progress, specifically a home invasion robbery,,,not a burglary. There is a huge difference between robbery and burglary. I saw nothing indicating the the police are not going to respond to robberies in progress, did you? \n \n \nYou mean the programs for illegal aliens? I doubt it.\n\n No, I mean like medicare, medicaid, welfare, social security, etc etc. Have you seen the unemployment numbers? Of coarse republicans and conservatives benefit from these programs...haven't you ever seen an episode of Cops?\n \n \nBut go live in Oakland and see how you like it. Maybe if enough of you liberal egg heads move out there we can salvage the rest of the country.\n\n Hmmm...a government entity operating more efficiently with less people, saving taxpayers money, and encouraging sensible utilization of resources while promoting a sense of individual responsibility to the community at large. That sounds horrible, right? Actually, it sounds just like what the conservatives in this country preach all the time, yet always seem to fail at. And I am not a liberal by any means, I am more of a Libertarian.\n \n \np.s. Your hero Obama is down to only 13% of the American people believing his policies benefited them. And considering half of those people are hairbrained liberals, I doubt Obama has much support at all amongst normal folks. \n\n Got a link to that poll? Or did you simply conjure those numbers. Last I saw, he was around tied for general approval/disapproval, depending on which poll you read. Personally, I think he is going to be remembered as one of the worst presidents of our time when our grandchildren and great-grandchildren look back in history. \n \n \nHow's that hope and change working out for you now? ROTFLOL!\n\n I take pride in supporting neither Obama or McCain. I actually want to see our country get better, not worse. And I will take great pride in supporting neither Obama or Palin (or Jindal or Romney or etc...) in the upcoming. \n \n I think it's amusing to watch right wing radicals run about touting the end of the world after they failed to achieve their eutopian state (through the fault of their immoral, bigoted, and failed domestic and foreign policies). But you are distracting me from how bad the Democrats are screwing the country by their continued use of those policies. Can't you look at anything objectively? Does a non-partisan perspective scare you so much? This nation's founding fathers would have scoffed at your narrow-mindedness.",

The seat he chose the first day sabbath, and the adjoining one, which his private secretary occupied, were ever afterwards by the courtesy of the congregation, left for him.\"\n \n The Old House of Representatives\n \n Church services were held in what is now called Statuary Hall from 1807 to 1857. The first services in the Capitol, held when the government moved to Washington in the fall of 1800, were conducted in the \"hall\" of the House in the north wing of the building. In 1801 the House moved to temporary quarters in the south wing, called the \"Oven,\" which it vacated in 1804, returning to the north wing for three years. Services were conducted in the House until after the Civil War. The Speaker's podium was used as the preacher's pulpit. \n \n A Millennialist Sermon Preached in Congress\n \n This sermon on the millennium was preached by the Baltimore Swedenborgian minister, John Hargrove (1750-1839) in the House of Representatives. One of the earliest millennialist sermons preached before Congress was offered on July 4, 1801, by the Reverend David Austin (1759-1831), who at the time considered himself \"struck in prophesy under the style of the Joshua of the American Temple.\" Having proclaimed to his Congressional audience the imminence of the Second Coming of Christ, Austin took up a collection on the floor of the House to support services at \"Lady Washington's Chapel\" in a nearby hotel where he was teaching that \"the seed of the Millennial estate is found in the backbone of the American Revolution.\"\n \n First Catholic Sermon in the House\n \n On January 8, 1826, Bishop John England (1786-1842) of Charleston, South Carolina, became the first Catholic clergyman to preach in the House of Representatives.

The first woman to preach before the House (and probably the first woman to speak officially in Congress under any circumstances) was the English evangelist, Dorothy Ripley (1767-1832), who conducted a service on January 12, 1806. Jefferson and Vice President Aaron Burr were among those in a \"crowded audience.\" Sizing up the congregation, Ripley concluded that \"very few\" had been born again and broke into an urgent, camp meeting style exhortation, insisting that \"Christ's Body was the Bread of Life and His Blood the drink of the righteous.\"\n \n Communion Service in the Treasury Building\n \n Manasseh Cutler here describes a four-hour communion service in the Treasury Building, conducted by a Presbyterian minister, the Reverend James Laurie: \"Attended worship at the Treasury.

Three tables; service very solemn; nearly four hours.\" \n \n Adams's Description of a Church Service in the Supreme Court\n \n John Quincy Adams here describes the Reverend James Laurie, pastor of a Presbyterian Church that had settled into the Treasury Building, preaching to an overflow audience in the Supreme Court Chamber, which in 1806 was located on the ground floor of the Capitol. \n \n \n The Old Supreme Court Chamber\n \n Description of church services in the Supreme Court chamber by Manasseh Cutler (1804) and John Quincy Adams (1806) indicate that services were held in the Court soon after the government moved to Washington in 1800.\n \n  Church Services in Congress after the Civil War\n \n Charles Boynton (1806-1883) was in 1867 chaplain of the House of Representatives and organizing pastor of the First Congregational Church in Washington, which was trying at that time to build its own sanctuary. In the meantime the church, as Boynton informed potential donors, was holding services \"at the Hall of Representatives\" where \"the audience is the largest in town. . . .nearly 2000 assembled every Sabbath\" for services, making the congregation in the House the \"largest Protestant Sabbath audience then in the United States.\" The First Congregational Church met in the House from 1865 to 1868. \n \n House of Representatives, After the Civil War\n \n The House moved to its current location on the south side of the Capitol in 1857.
