   "So the trial for the \"husband from hell\" is just about over. With the closing arguments complete, now we all have to wait for the jury to deliberate.\n \n How does everyone feel about this case? Do you think he'll walk or get what he deserves? Also - I've been told that the judge is only going to give a 2-hour notice once the jury has reached its verdict. We do have a cable TV in the lounge area here at work, so I've been setting it to Court TV to try and keep up-to-date. I even noticed on their website that you can get the verdict sent to your cell phone, which is pretty crazy (though I'm the only one of my friends without one yet!)\n \n Personally, there's nothing I'd rather see than a death sentence for this disgusting human, though life in prison wouldn't be a bad 2nd option either.\n \n Kimberly",

   "Hello, Kimberly. Welcome to the site.\n \n Is there enough evidence to convict? Or are you like me, just know by his actions that he's guilty?\n \n If they've seen all they need (the jury, that is) to make a call, I think it will be 2 counts 2nd degree at the most.\n \n He's done everything that a person should not do in a situation like this - if he's not guilty. I can't say what more he could have done wrong....",
