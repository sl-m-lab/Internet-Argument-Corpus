   "November 15, 2008\n Obama Has More Threats Than Other Presidents-Elect\n By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\n WASHINGTON (AP) -- Threats against a new president historically spike right after an election, but from Maine to Idaho law enforcement officials are seeing more against Barack Obama than ever before. The Secret Service would not comment or provide the number of cases they are investigating. But since the Nov. 4 election, law enforcement officials have seen more potentially threatening writings, Internet postings and other activity directed at Obama than has been seen with any past president-elect, said officials aware of the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity because the issue of a president's security is so sensitive.\n\n http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/washington/AP-Obama-Threats.html\n \n America, get over it.\n \n The day of racism should never have been and by this time should have been long gone.\n \n Grow up, America!\n \n This is the 21st century where people are people, not colors of skin.",

   "Surely it's not necessarily directly racism, it could just be a result of the horrendous scaremongering by the right wing media and the blogosphere about Obama being a crypto-marxist.\n\n I believe that it is a combination. I heard on NPR that the Secret Service has tracked far more threats against Obama since Sarah Palin starting her \"palling around with terrorists\", \"Socialist\"... crusade. According to the Secret Service, that has helped increase the number of threats. However, I think that the threats wouldn't be as high if it weren't for the fact that he is also black - so the extremists in the US not only fear that they we have elected a terrorist-sympathiser but that we have elected someone who will give African Americans benefits at the expense of whites. I have heard that there are some very extreme bloggers who claimed that Obama would try to have blacks enslave whites. The bottom line is that there is a small minority of lunatic fringe nutcases out there that have not only bought into the Republican fearmongering rhetoric but have taken it to a whole new level, where some might well be capable of trying to launch an assasination attempt. I certainly hope that the Secret Service is prepared. Heck, I would even contribute money to them if they were taking donations.",

Indeed, most Republicans I have spoken with also appreciate the positive step our country has taken in choosing an African American president (though they differ with his politics). Even most of those who still harbor some racist sentiments have views on race that are far less extreme than the majority of the US population had a few decades ago. So, I personally think that race relations have improved significantly over the decaades - on the Republican side as well.\n \n Do you, on the other hand, deny that there ARE extremist racists out there? Do you seriously think that racism has 100% disappeared? These are the extremists that I personally am referring to. Remember, it is not the normal range of people who commit assasinations.

After all, Hillary Clinton's election would also have been a historical one - as the first woman. What caught people's attention about Obama from the begining was his personal magnetism and his skills at speaking. That is a characteristic that Gore, Kerry, as well as Hillary Clinton (much as I liked them) lacked. For better or worse, personality makes a big difference in the electibility of a candidate. Bill Clinton had it, Obama has it, other Democratic contenders had much less. Apart from anger at the Bush legacy and the problems with the Economy, personality also helped Obama win against McCain - who seemed less decisive, calm and rational.\n \n However, I would agree that, once Obama was chosen as the Democratic candidate, his race did help him in bringing out such a high African American vote. I'm not sure, though, if it is his race (as opposed to his personality) that brought him so much support from non-blacks.",

The message is supposed to be that EVERYONE has great potential. There is a segment of the left that thrives off of victim-hood and it gets under my skin how it gets turned around... \n\n I agree that the message of political correctness has gone too far at times, where REAL problems are not addressed because we are so afraid of offending that we ignore problems instead of addressing them. Where the African American community is concerned, there still is some racism that limits growth but the racism of society in general has decreased significantly in the last few decades and most of the problems that African Americans face as a community nowadays are for more tied in with economics (i.e. the fact that they are poor, in poor communities) than with race. These are the same problems faced by poor white, Latino, Asian, ... groups as well. The trouble is that the poor in general have gotten little support in growth so they really have to lift THEMSELVES up by their bootstraps. Though I hate to generalize and each group has a wide variety of examples, trends seem to show that Asians are particularly good at lifting themselves out of poverty, as well as Jewish people. I have heard that both groups often pool family resources to help one member of the family succeed (through education, etc) so that he / she can then help out the other family members. This method of climbing the social ladder seems to be practiced much less by blacks, or even by whites. Furthermore, the psychology of Victimhood, though it can be satisfying, helps instill the notion that people's futures are not in their own hands. As long as people think that they cannot make successful efforts to better their lives, most won't even try. If they don't try, they are guaranteed failure. I think if the Victimhood mentality diminished, more poor people would make more efforts of lifting THEMSELVES out of poverty.\n \nOf course, there are racists out there. There are racist blacks and racist whites and racist Chinese. There are sexists (male AND female), there are ageists (young AND old), there are all kinds of XXXXXX. However, the problem is more on the individual level, it is not systemic. And it tends to balance out... for every white racist there is a black racist and for those 2 guys there are 10 whites and 10 blacks who aren't racist.\n\n Yes, there are racists on all sides, but violent extremist racists blacks have far more of a tendency to take out their agression in crime and much less of a history (if any) of making political assasinations. The racist white extremists have had a history of killing civil rights workers, killing politically active blacks, etc. - as well as of killing Martin Luther King. What political assasination would you say that extremist racist blacks made against whites?\n \nFurthermore, how many movies were made or books written about killing Bush? Was that because he was white? Of course not they were politically motivated.\n\n I am not saying that assasinations do not occur because of politics. Indeed, when it comes to Obama, I thought I made it clear that I believed that BOTH politics and race would lead to such threats. It is certainly clear that politics does play a role since, as I said in my first post, the Secret Service has said that threats against Obama have risen significantly after Palin's rhetoric of \"palling around with terrorists\", \"Socialist\", etc. I just think that racism ALSO plays a role in threats against Obama.\n \nThere is and always will be people who hate others because of what they look like or what they believe or whatever. But to blow them out of proportion increases friction, gives comfort in imagined numbers to those who are racist, and causes others to take shelter in victim-hood- encouraging them to leave their potential unfulfilled.\n\n I personally do not think that their numbers are large, so I didn't think that I personally was exagerating their numbers. However, I can understand how many left-wing posters might give that impression and I agree that it distorts the reality. I would agree that racism has diminished significantly in the last few decades. However, I personally think that there are hold-outs of extreme racism (in the neo-Nazi movements, white supremastist groupst, etc.) that might hold onto their views despite general society's disaproval. In some ways, the fact that they represent an even weaker minority may make them even more dangerous. If you corner a dangerous animal, they are more likely to attack. Those on the extreme end might think that Obama's election, along with general society's growing indifference to racial differences, will spell the end of their hopes for a white-dominated society so they may see his election as even more of a threat than they would if more of society supported their views. Anyway, whether or not these suppositions have any validity, I certainly see that, despite having fewer numbers, there are still violent racists out there - some of which could be capable of trying to assasinate Obama. The fact that he is black just draws more threats than if he were white with the same political views and capabilities.",

The state of Capitalism at the end of the 19th century, beginning of 20th century showed that unrestrained Capitalism not only hurts employees and consumers, but limits competition (and the healthy development of ideas that it engenders) by the development of all-powerful monopolies. On the other extreme lies true socialism/communism, which may have had a much narrower income disparity and which supported greater safety nets but whose industries were very inefficient since they were government run, resulting in poorer economies. Even if the communist economies were coupled with Democratic politics, that still would have left inneficient systems since the self-interest inherent in private (as opposed to public) ownership of companies, along with competition, makes for greater flexibility, creativity, efficiency and, thus, more robust economies.\n \n In the US, we face neither of those extremes but we do face other balances:[*]Increasing taxes on industry allows the country to finance more social programs, military programs, infrastructure, etc - but risks making the industries uncompetitive if taxes are too high[*]Increasing the number of regulations can control the extreme behavior of some industries but can also stiffle inovation and make companies non-competitive if the regulations represent too much of a straightjacket.[*]Cutting taxes stimulates economies but increases debt or causes reductions in valued programs[*]Decreasing taxes of the wealthy increases investment, while decreasing taxes of the Middle Class increases spending - which is more effective at boosting economic growth for all? That is still not clear.These are just some of the balances faced in economic questions that have no single right answer. The answer partly depends on the value one places in community responsibility vs individual self-interest - i.e. how much do we feel responsible for other people in our community. I, for one, earn a good salary and think that it is right and proper that my taxes should be higher to subsidize those who are underpriviledged. However, I, as most people, would be hesitant in giving money to those who make no effort - which is why I also supported welfare reform. Nevertheless, I view that even those who make no effort at supporting themselves deserve some minimal state of life just for being human - homeless shelters can supply the minimal shelter and food for life, while an Obama-like subsidized health care system can supply health needs. Anyway, those are my values and I make economic judgements based on those values along with some understanding (granted still too limited) about what the market can take in terms of taxes.\n \n Where social issues are concerned, it also depends on what one values. Abortion pits the rights of a woman to her own body vs. rights of a fetus and questions about when such rights kick in. Gay marriage / civil union mostly seems to be waged between those who view gays as people who naturally feel connections to the same sex and should have the same rights as other people vs. those who think that same-sex unions are immoral (which I personally still fail to understand) and that they are not ingrained but voluntary lifestyle choices. Gun control contraversy pits people's concerns about controling crime against those who view that gun ownership is a right that should be absolute and uncontrolled.\n \n I hope that young people also look at the pros and cons of their various views but I suspect that this has not improved through the years. Some young people are responsible and thoroughly think-through their views. Others just go with the flow of their peer group.",

   "I agree that the message of political correctness has gone too far at times, where REAL problems are not addressed because we are so afraid of offending that we ignore problems instead of addressing them. Where the African American community is concerned, there still is some racism that limits growth but the racism of society in general has decreased significantly in the last few decades and most of the problems that African Americans face as a community nowadays are for more tied in with economics (i.e. the fact that they are poor, in poor communities) than with race. These are the same problems faced by poor white, Latino, Asian, ... groups as well. The trouble is that the poor in general have gotten little support in growth so they really have to lift THEMSELVES up by their bootstraps. Though I hate to generalize and each group has a wide variety of examples, trends seem to show that Asians are particularly good at lifting themselves out of poverty, as well as Jewish people. I have heard that both groups often pool family resources to help one member of the family succeed (through education, etc) so that he / she can then help out the other family members. This method of climbing the social ladder seems to be practiced much less by blacks, or even by whites. Furthermore, the psychology of Victimhood, though it can be satisfying, helps instill the notion that people's futures are not in their own hands. As long as people think that they cannot make successful efforts to better their lives, most won't even try. If they don't try, they are guaranteed failure. I think if the Victimhood mentality diminished, more poor people would make more efforts of lifting THEMSELVES out of poverty.\n\n \n \n I agree 100%. I also think that reliance on the govt. welfare programs tends to exacerbate poverty, lulling recipients into a rut of dependency and forestalling any efforts to improve (and I think this is well know and accepted by much of the leadership of different minority groups!).\n \n \n \n \n Yes, there are racists on all sides, but violent extremist racists blacks have far more of a tendency to take out their agression in crime and much less of a history (if any) of making political assasinations. The racist white extremists have had a history of killing civil rights workers, killing politically active blacks, etc. - as well as of killing Martin Luther King. What political assasination would you say that extremist racist blacks made against whites?\n\n \n I was mainly commenting on the tendency of people on the left to castigate the US for systemic racism that doesn't exist. I did really notice the assassination aspect of the thread until later. I do agree with your view about whites killing black leaders, but with one caveat. Most of what you are talking about happened 30+ years ago. There have been hate crimes in the last few decades, but again, these are individual instances, not systemic problems. Also, I'd have to say the vehement hatred of Bush went far beyond anything Obama has faced.\n \n \n \n I am not saying that assasinations do not occur because of politics. Indeed, when it comes to Obama, I thought I made it clear that I believed that BOTH politics and race would lead to such threats. It is certainly clear that politics does play a role since, as I said in my first post, the Secret Service has said that threats against Obama have risen significantly after Palin's rhetoric of \"palling around with terrorists\", \"Socialist\", etc. I just think that racism ALSO plays a role in threats against Obama..\n\n \n \n I'd have to say the vehement hatred of Bush went far beyond anything Obama has faced.\n \n \n \n\n I personally do not think that their numbers are large, so I didn't think that I personally was exagerating their numbers. However, I can understand how many left-wing posters might give that impression and I agree that it distorts the reality. I would agree that racism has diminished significantly in the last few decades. However, I personally think that there are hold-outs of extreme racism (in the neo-Nazi movements, white supremastist groupst, etc.) that might hold onto their views despite general society's disaproval. In some ways, the fact that they represent an even weaker minority may make them even more dangerous. If you corner a dangerous animal, they are more likely to attack. Those on the extreme end might think that Obama's election, along with general society's growing indifference to racial differences, will spell the end of their hopes for a white-dominated society so they may see his election as even more of a threat than they would if more of society supported their views. Anyway, whether or not these suppositions have any validity, I certainly see that, despite having fewer numbers, there are still violent racists out there - some of which could be capable of trying to assasinate Obama. The fact that he is black just draws more threats than if he were white with the same political views and capabilities.\n\n \n \n I didn't mean to say that you were exaggerating it, just that it gets exaggerated. Sorry for the misunderstanding. Again, I agree that some groups hate Obama even more because he's black but then again, there are lots of people on the left that hate Bush all the more because he is a Republican. But most importantly, the most dangerous groups are the Islamists who hate us all because of our freedom and want to kill Obama just as much as they'd want to kill Bush- because they are American. I think deep down, most of the racists that dislike Obama aren't likely to do anything, just as most leftists weren't willing to try anything with Bush. The true danger comes from those who hate what these men stand for in a Geo-political sense.",

   "I agree 100%. I also think that reliance on the govt. welfare programs tends to exacerbate poverty, lulling recipients into a rut of dependency and forestalling any efforts to improve (and I think this is well know and accepted by much of the leadership of different minority groups!).\n\n I would agree. There was a lot of welfare reform introduced in the 90s but I hear that there are still problems. I would also think, though, that the government has to help make it easier for welfare recipients to transition to having jobs with job training and free or subsidized day care. I think this was resisted in the 90s - I'm not sure of its current status.\n \nI was mainly commenting on the tendency of people on the left to castigate the US for systemic racism that doesn't exist. I did really notice the assassination aspect of the thread until later. I do agree with your view about whites killing black leaders, but with one caveat.

Also, I'd have to say the vehement hatred of Bush went far beyond anything Obama has faced.\n\n I would say that racism in general has significantly reduced but that the racism that is left (which is still significant) has also taken on a more subtle aspect - just as with sexism. Fewer people feel free to openly express their racism (in claiming black inferiority, etc.) but many will still make automatic assumptions about blacks that they will not make about whites - assumptions that they themselves may not even realize that they are making. This is a form of racism that is harder to eradicate and will only go away once people see sufficient examples of successful blacks. I believe that the presidency of Obama will go a long way in helping to eradicate this more subtle form of racism since he clearly is far different from the negative stereotypes and he is in such a high profile position. \n \n As for Bush being more vehemently hated than Obama, I would have to say that Obama is already vehimently hated by many who already think that he is going to destroy America - even before he has actually done anything. Also, the hatred of Bush, which I agree is pretty strong, mainly started after he started making major mistake after major mistake. Remember, he had an ~80% approval rate after 9/11. I doubt that the ~30% Religious Right would have given Obama the same approval under the same circumstances as those on the left gave Bush at that time.\n \n Lastly, you do make a good point that most of these white-on-black political assasinations did happen 30+ years ago and that there haven't been any major politically motivated assasinations since. I hope that this does indeed mean that the possibility of racially motivated assasinations has greatly diminished. My main concern is that Obama is the first very visible African American of potentially enormous influence that has emerged since the time of Martin Luther King. The prominent African Americans that have emerged since have had much less potential for change. This would make him more of a target for extremist racists than any since the time of Martin Luther King. The main question in my mind is whether the extremist racists that are left will be less likely to launch an assasination attempt because they would be thwarted by the recognition of modern society's much less racist stance, or whether they would feel the need for a desperate act of assasination of such a prominent figure to keep our country from going too far (in their view) in race equality. I would certainly agree that the threat of his assasination would have been much greater thirty years ago. I simply think that one cannot discount it completely because one thinks that most of society has changed since there are still some racists left that are just as extreme as the most extreme racists of 30 years ago. \n \nI didn't mean to say that you were exaggerating it, just that it gets exaggerated. Sorry for the misunderstanding. Again, I agree that some groups hate Obama even more because he's black but then again, there are lots of people on the left that hate Bush all the more because he is a Republican.

I think deep down, most of the racists that dislike Obama aren't likely to do anything, just as most leftists weren't willing to try anything with Bush. The true danger comes from those who hate what these men stand for in a Geo-political sense.\n\n I think the Islamists are driven by a number of factors. Yes, one of those is that they would like to have their extremist form of Islam spread throughout the world so any Democratic system would have to be dismantled in their eyes to introduce their version of government. The other side of our freedom / Democracy that they might view negatively is the fact that it has allowed for a wider range of social behavior - much of which they view very badly (particularly where women are concerned). The relative equality of our women is something that they just don't understand or support. \n \n However, I think that most of their motivation stems from a very exagerated view of how the West treats Islam - especially the US, being the most powerful country of the West and the most directly involved. A few hundred years ago, Islamic countries were more dominant in the world than Western countries and their reduction in status still continues to hurt - especially since they view themselves as culturally superior. That, along with our support of Israel, our involvements in Iran, war in Iraq, involvements in Lebanon, support of strong pro-Western dictatorships in Saudi Arabia, etc. - all add to their hatred of us and resentment at our use of power. Aparently, they often claim that the US is trying to destroy Islam in general (Heck, I think that most of us wouldn't mind destroying extremist Islam but very few in the US have much against the moderates.). All of these exagerated claims gain them support in the Islamic world, which gains them recruits. On our part, we just need to be careful not to inflame Islamic anger un-necesarrily (ex. by starting un-necessary wars in Iraq or being too one-sided in our support for Israel). We should only interfere when necessary - as with Afghanistan and with discussions with Iran about nuclear weapons.",
