   "LOS ANGELES, California (AP) -- Most Americans oppose same-sex marriage and many believe homosexuality is \"against God's will,\" but otherwise consider themselves tolerant of gays, according to a Los Angeles Times poll.\n \n 55 percent believe gays being allowed to marry will degrade the institution of marriage and about half agreed with a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage, out of the 1,616 polled nation wide\n \n This framework is just odd to me. We live in a land that condemns Saudi Arabia for restricting equality and liberties to all. See I'm one of the people that think women should be able to drive, voice their opinion and go out in public, even if their government is a big ally of Bush. This is my problem with the hypocrisy of our free democracy that shafts people of the rights that they truly deserve.\n \n It is ironic to me that this administration can take rights and deem them privileges when it suits their purposes. This sanctity of marriage was nothing more than some rich and proper people trying to spare their social class from being infiltrated by peasants centuries ago. Marriage was about dowries and making money off your children, by marry them off to the most profitable, whether it being monetary or social. \n \n See the essence of love that binds marriage so truly today, is relatively a new creed acquired in the last 200 years. So this sanctity of love and the deep bond that's shared is a whole lot of propaganda, which is surprisingly shoved so deeply into our faces by Christian conservatives. These are the same people that condemn Islamic fundamentalism but refer back to their tyranny in just the right cases.\n \n When nearly 70 percent of new marriages end up in divorce and I can marry my asexual third cousin in Vegas by a an Elvis that reeks of bourbon, just because she is of the opposite sex, doesn't sanctify the idea of marriage, even if I have the license to say so.\n \n You see it's all about restricting rights. Once you claim to be a citizen of this nation you submit all rights of superiority, because our great nation is supposed to deem us all equals. So to restrict financial rights and an institution that can be shared by the majority, is not only ignorant but it is down right bigotry. Now to be a bigot in the privacy of your home is legal in this free flowing democracy, just go to any KKK website, but to write it in to law, is not only sacrilege when it comes to our creed, but it is the utmost discrimination against its citizens.\n \n So finally when I hear conservatives say, if you don't like it here, move to Saudi Arabia and enjoy their freedom. You see that's the problem, I love my country because of the freedoms it has given me and I object because of one that has negligently been taken away. Our government is supposed to look out for the safety of all citizens and ensure their civil rights even if it sees interference. It is not my fault that half the nation is blinded by religious fundamentalism to the point that it affects people's lives and who they are. Religious institutions are allowed to discriminate; they never have to acknowledge gay marriage. The U.S. government however, the protectors and providers of its citizens, is not allowed to show people that same unbalance of rights.\n \n Remi\n Check out my new website, poeticinjustice.net, I have a forums page as well",

I should have been more specific. I'm talking about when the term 'marriage' shifted from a religious/community unioin, to a 'legal' version that included tax breaks, and benifits and all that jazz. It was a slow process (and not all that long ago). What they (government) did though, is set themselves up to define marriage. And no one specifically defined it. And then they started assigning benifits. And still there were no definitions set in stone. So now either they're going to have to start making exceptions, or give the ceremony back to the church... and both are going to amount in debates and chaos. \n I'm just saying they messed up doing that. I know this opinion holds a lot of flaws... \n Anywho, I just think they should slowly start changing the 'benifit/break' plans, so it's not so politically oriented. It will save us from a lot of trouble in the future",

Your claim that only right wing religious fanatics would argue against legalizing gay marriage is belied by poll after poll shows that at least 60% of Americans are against homosexual marriage. And for many of the rest, it is just an attitude of tolerance, not that they positively value homosexual marriage. It is just this attitude of \"whatever people want to do\" or \"anything goes\" that is a major problem in our culture right now. That is just plain nihilism: there are no authoritative values, no right and wrong. If you want to move in with a goat, who am I to question it? Personally, I have nothing against homosexuality, but it is high time we said enough nihilism! For the last 40 years, we have been unable to tell anyone \"NO!\" If we destroy all the traditional restraints, there will be nothing in the way of every imaginable impulse from having free reign. Freud said \"Civilization is only made possible by individual renouncement.\" He knew that unchecked [natural] passions will eventually lead to the destruction of civilization. On our present course, we will one day see the ruins of a once great society. But at least we'll be able to say, \"Well at least we didn't judge anybody!\" \n \n \"Any healthy society requires an authoritative moral structure to lead people to prosocial behavior. The bedrock of that structure in the U.S. has been the Bible, and when you discredit it, people find themselves in a moral vacuum where there are only personal tastes and preferences, and Freud was right that people run only by their ids ends up in chaos. As I said before, gay marriage itself is not that big of a deal to me, and I might go along with the cultural nihilists if they would promise me this was the very LAST time they would destroy another traditional value. But I know them too well; their logic will never let them stop.\"",

   "Post #8 is a slippery slope fallacy. The legally married gays I know have great ethics. They are not contributing to a lack of ethics. They are not contributing to the eventual falling of the sky.\n\n \n My comment was really an empirical one, not an unobserved idea that one thing automatically leads to another. Let me expand with an earlier comment:\n \n \"In last 40 years, while people like some in this thread have trashed Chistianity and the traditional moral foundation of American society, a tidal wave of social problems the likes of we've never seen before has swept over the country. Crime is several times what it was pre-1960. In the 60s there were a few thousand gang members in the country who were about as nasty as the dancing guys in \"West Side Story\"; now there are 1 million Tech 9-toting gangbangers, dealing drugs to kids and killing them in drive-bys. Addictions are of control: drugs--legal and illegal--gambling, sex, pornography, you name it. The porn industry was underground in the 60s and now it's a multi-billion dollar industry. We supply the world with porn these days. STDS were at low levels; AIDS was non-existent. Now 25% of women have genital herpes and hundreds of thousands are HIV positive. The percent of kids under 15 having sex several times higher than in the past. More than 1 million abortions are performed every year, half of them on fetuses more than 2 months old. Divorce and out-of-wedlock births exploded in the 60s were now 1/2 of kids grow up with little involvement by dad; 70% of blacks kids are born to an unwed mom. Infidelity is way up. I could go on and on, but the list of social ills is getting tedious.\" \n \n \"Of course there are a number of reasons why we are in deep moral decline, but one important reason for this is the loss of respect for tradtional notions of right and wrong, with nothing but a moral vacuum remaining.\" \n \n So my point is an empirical one. And you are suggesting that I'm doomsdaying, but from the perspective of the long sweep of history, the dramatic revolution we've seen morally in only 40 years is cataclysmic. So were does that put us in 80 more years? Or 200? I don't apologize for looking at things very long-term; it is a strength for one's position, not a weakness.",

Focusing on something more common, gangs of the type we see today did not exist in schools prior to the 1960's, yet now 10% of school-age boys report belonging to a gang. If you would like, we can go back and forth citing examples of social problems, but in my view it is wishful thinking to attempt to show that the kinds of social problems I listed above were just as bad or worse in the past. Can you find bad behavior at all times and places? Of course, that goes without saying, but my point is that the overall level of social problems is much worse now than 50 years ago, and that worsening parallels the trend toward discrediting Christianity.",

Legalizing it does not say we're ok with your homosexual lifestyle, even though we disagree with it. It says we embrace the lifestyle completely and fully equate it with heterosexual marriage.

Let's take for example, the traditional value \"Don't have sex until you are married.\" That value was ALWAYS arbitrary in the sense you mean, because it was always a pain in the *** to have to deny oneself sex. Traditional values are necessary BECAUSE they run against what is easy, convenient, expedient, tempting, short-sighted, etc. People have abandoned that value not because it is not longer relevant; they have abandoned it because it's much more attractive to one's hedonistic side to go for a new ethic which says \"Do whatever you want; do what feels good.\" The traditional values encouraged hard behavior now for positive social consequences down the road. Back in the day, few people got pregnant out of wedlock; now it is very common. Back then few unwed teens got pregnant; now it is common. Back then, there was no such thing as AIDS; now tens of millions are HIV positive worldwide. Back then few women had STDs; now one quarter of American women have genital herpes; half of black women.

You have to be very careful about arguing for new values because values only work when they have authority behind them. But nowadays people will say, ok here's a new value, but it has no weight because many people will say that is just so and so's morality--it's made up out of thin air and will get no obedience from me. Values do not lead to prosocial behavior unless that are revered, and the only source of values that produces reverence is tradition and religion both of which are built up over many years. \n \n I am a pragmatist who looks for the best situation for the greatest number of people.

   "I understand the point you are making but I feel you are looking thorugh rose tinted glasses at the past, also I have some doubts about whether it is right to deny responsible people certain things that would lead to do harm. Take your example with sex before marriage (though more liekly it would be sex and then marriage if the girl got pregnant, or kill/give the baby away and pretend it never happened), with proper education and actions carried out there is no harm and many benefits (a lot more than immediate gratification of the act). Those who do not follow the sensible cause and 'abuse' the options given to them will suffer as a direct result of the actions, society needs to help prevent this abuse and help those effected by these choices rather than trying to level an outright ban. HIV is rampant in Africa where 'traditional values' are doing far more harm than good, the reason it wasn't a problem earlier is because it is new, before then it was syphilis and it was rampant before (but had effects that decreased the chance of you spreading it and wasn't so deadly).\n \n The Gay marriage thing still doesn't make sense to me, other than it is a traditional value and you have to start to make a stand somewhere. Gay marriage isn't really going to lead to any social problems (or is it, can you think of any?) and it is this kind of thing that is causing people to abandon traditional values far more than any intellectual critism. Morality can not be static as it is intrisintically linked with society and technology and must change as they do. Old ideals are the best for the basis of new ones in most cases (or in any case the ones that will be accpeted) but they will change naturally as the thing they were designed to prevent becomes irrelevant- look at the Jewish law about eating pigs, disregarding any divine rules here, it amkes sense for a desert dwelling people not to eat a meat that contains parasites that they can not easily get rid of, but today this is no longer an issue and not held anymore by the majority of people who would have held onto that old law.",

Maybe. Almost all sports are separated between men and women - because, while the rules may be the same, there is a fundamental difference between those groups.\n \n Regards",
