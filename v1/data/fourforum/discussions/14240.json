   "Using Freedom of Information Act requests, archival records, federal budgets and dozens of interviews with leaders and analysts, the AP tracked where that money went, and found that the United States repeatedly increased budgets for programs that did little to stop the flow of drugs. In 40 years, taxpayers spent more than:\n \n $20 billion to fight the drug gangs in their home countries. In Colombia, for example, the United States spent more than $6 billion, while coca cultivation increased and trafficking moved to Mexico - and the violence along with it.\n $33 billion in marketing \"Just Say No\"-style messages to America's youth and other prevention programs. High school students report the same rates of illegal drug use as they did in 1970, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says drug overdoses have \"risen steadily\" since the early 1970s to more than 20,000 last year.\n $49 billion for law enforcement along America's borders to cut off the flow of illegal drugs. This year, 25 million Americans will snort, swallow, inject and smoke illicit drugs, about 10 million more than in 1970, with the bulk of those drugs imported from Mexico.\n $121 billion to arrest more than 37 million nonviolent drug offenders, about 10 million of them for possession of marijuana. Studies show that jail time tends to increase drug abuse.\n $450 billion to lock those people up in federal prisons alone. Last year, half of all federal prisoners in the U.S. were serving sentences for drug offenses.\n U.S. drug war has met none of its goals - Security- msnbc.com\n \n\n \n Can't we just rise up and beat our leaders already? How much more money are we going to throw down the flushing toilet before they get it through their heads. \n \n Despite obvious failings (and campaign promises by Obama to shift focus away from law enforcement and towards treatment and prevention)...the war on drugs will never be ended by the federal government. It will happen at the state level first, and the feds will have to finally accept it. My guess is because the war on drugs is big business for our government, and creates so many jobs. Personally, I think we should take all of those people who are actively involved in the war on drugs and put them to good use rebuilding highways and infrastructure. I can't wait to see what happens in California this Nov. If they legalize marijuana and show that it can be done effectively without increasing crime while generating revenue, the war on drugs could be dealt a very serious blow. Here's hoping.",
