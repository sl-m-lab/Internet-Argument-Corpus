   "The Seahawks vs. Steelers matchup has all the makings of a real good game. I personaly admire both teams and their coaches. Who is more deserving than Pittsburgh coach Cowher? I also have great respect for Mike Holmgren...what he did with the Packers is the stuff of legend and here he is again in the big one with Seattle.\n \n I see it as even, the Vegas odds say Steelers by 3 1/2.\n \n The other cool thing is it has been a long, long time since the Steelers have been to the championship game and a big NEVER for the Seahawks. I kinda like that.\n \n So, anyhoo, and without further adoo.....\n \n Seahawks 34....Steelers 28.\n \n Take it to the bank.",

   "As much as part of me doesn't want to root for the Steelers (as they beat my Broncos) I have always liked them and must cheer them. I am horrible at guessing scores, but an overtime game in the Super Bowl would be awesome! Has that ever happened?\n\n \n You like the Broncos too? My mom's family lives in Denver so I've always been a Broncos fan, and I picked them to go all the way this year in the pool. They went further than most people thought (most had them losing to NE), but Pittsburgh just looked great.\n \n As for OT in a Super Bowl, I don't THINK it has ever happened. Remember the Rams-Titans Super Bowl, where the Titans player no matter how far he reached was still about a yard short. That would have sent it into OT and I think they were all saying how that would have been the first time. There hasn't been OT since then, so I don't think so.\n \n As for the Super Bowl. Both of these teams are great. Many people don't think Seattle has much of a chance, but they weren't ranked #2 in the NFL for nothing. But on the other hand the Steelers handled the #1 ranked team in the NFL. The Seahawks have one of the best RBs in Shaun Alexander and Matt Hasselback didn't look too shabby the last few games. They will be tough to beat. But then again anyone who has watched the Steelers play also realize that their defense has been amazing, Palamalou (sp?) is simply amazing with his speed and the blitz can mess up any QB. This is going to be a very close game.\n \n The Steelers have had to play tough every game, barely holding on to the Colts, but the Seahawks have simply handled every opponent they faced. I'll take the Seahawks in a close game, say 24-21.",
