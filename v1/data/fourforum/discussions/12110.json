   "Excluding Japan, most industrial nations have cut their corporate tax rates to be more competitive.\n \n The big story though is Ireland.\n \n Into the 1990's, Ireland was known as \"the sick man of Europe\" mostly because its workers had to leave Ireland to find work commensurate with workers' work skills.\n \n In the early 90's, it drastically reduced its corporate tax rate, till reaching a low rate of 12 1/2% compared to our present 35%.\n \n Major corporations poured into Ireland--jobs have soared ever since. Ireland is now more prosperous than all the major industrial nations of Europe.\n \n Education advancement was also involved in Ireland's improvement, along with other changes. They all contributed to the positive results.\n \n However reducing the cost of government from 55% to 39% was the big difference.\n \n This has been the case in most states, sometimes 2 and 3 times and countries all over the world for decades.\n \n In the U.S. a rate of 25%, would be a good start to be matched by removal of any loophole (no matter what you call it--credit, allowance, subsidy etc.) so that normal business expenses, are the only deductions.\n \n The Left hates admitting that cutting tax rates and reducing the cost of government practically always yields great results. They usually skirt all around the issue, by bringing some form of victim/class warfare charade, into the discussion.",
