In 2002 she\n said, \"I don't think anybody could have predicted that ... they would try to\n use an airplane as a missile, a hijacked airplane as a missile\" (1). She\n said this in spite of the intelligence community having issued 12 separate\n warnings of such a plan, including a 1999 warning saying that \"suicide\n bomber(s) belonging to al Qaeda's Martyrdom Battalion could crash-land an\n aircraft...into the Pentagon, the headquarters of the Central Intelligence\n Agency (CIA), or the White House\" (2). When presented with these facts, she\n told the 9/11 Commission in January 2004 that she misspoke and that she\n \"regretted\" her earlier denials (3). Yet less than four months after her\n apology, she made the same false claim, writing in a March 22, 2004 op-ed in\n the Washington Post that \"we received no intelligence that terrorists were\n preparing to attack the homeland using airplanes as missiles\" (4).\n \n Secondly, Rice is now saying through spokesmen that she was \"not briefed\"\n about terrorists' plans to use airplanes as missiles before 2002, when she\n began making the false claim that she had no such warnings (5). But even if\n Rice did neglect all 12 previous intelligence reports, she cannot claim she\n was never briefed about such a threat, considering she was the top national\n security official accompanying President Bush to the G-8 Summit in Genoa,\n Italy in July 2001. There, she and the president were explicitly warned that\n \"Islamic terrorists might attempt to kill world leaders by crashing an\n airliner\" into the summit (6).\n \n Sources:\n 1.

The truth is in the timeline: \n \n PRESIDENT CARTER, DEMOCRAT \n \n In 1979, President Jimmy Carter allowed the Shah of Iran to be deposed by a mob of Islamic fanatics. A few months later, Muslims stormed the U.S. Embassy in Iran and took American Embassy staff hostage. \n \n \n Carter retaliated by canceling Iranian visas. He eventually ordered a disastrous and humiliating rescue attempt, crashing helicopters in the desert. \n \n PRESIDENT REAGAN, REPUBLICAN \n \n The day of Reagan\\'s inauguration, the hostages were released. \n \n \n In 1982, the U.S. Embassy in Beirut was bombed by Muslim extremists. \n \n \n President Reagan sent U.S. Marines to Beirut. \n \n \n In 1983, the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut were blown up by Muslim extremists. \n \n \n Reagan said the U.S. would not surrender, but Democrats threw a hissy fit, introducing a resolution demanding that our troops be withdrawn. Reagan caved in to Democrat caterwauling in an election year and withdrew our troops - bombing Syrian-controlled areas on the way out. Democrats complained about that, too. \n \n \n In 1985 an Italian cruise ship, the Achille Lauro, was seized and a 69-year-old American was shot and thrown overboard by Muslim extremists. \n \n \n Reagan ordered a heart-stopping mission to capture the hijackers after \"the allies\" promised them safe passage. In a daring operation, American fighter pilots captured the hijackers and turned them over to the Italians - who then released them to safe harbor in Iraq. \n \n \n On April 5, 1986, a West Berlin discotheque frequented by U.S. servicemen was bombed by Muslim extremists from the Libyan Embassy in East Berlin, killing an American. \n \n \n Ten days later, Reagan bombed Libya, despite our dear ally France refusing the use of their airspace. Americans bombed Qaddafi\\'s residence, killing his daughter, and dropped a bomb on the French Embassy \"by mistake.\" \n \n \n Reagan also stoked a long, bloody war between heinous regimes in Iran and Iraq. All this was while winning a final victory over Soviet totalitarianism. \n \n PRESIDENT BUSH I, MODERATE REPUBLICAN \n \n \n President-elect George Bush claimed he would continue Reagan\\'s policy of retaliating against terrorism, but did not. Without Reagan to gin her up, even Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher went wobbly, saying there would be no revenge for the bombing. \n \n \n In 1990, Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. \n \n \n In early 1991, Bush went to war with Iraq. A majority of Democrats opposed the war, and later complained that Bush didn\\'t \"finish off the job\" with Saddam. \n \n PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON, DEMOCRAT \n \n In February 1993, the World Trade Center was bombed by Muslim fanatics, killing five people and injuring hundreds. \n \n \n Clinton, advised by Dick Clarke, did nothing. \n \n \n In October 1993, 18 American troops were killed in a savage firefight in Somalia. The body of one American was dragged through the streets of Mogadishu as the Somalian hordes cheered. \n \n \n Clinton responded by calling off the hunt for Mohammed Farrah Aidid and ordering our troops home. Osama bin Laden later told ABC News: \"The youth ... realized more than before that the American soldier was a paper tiger and after a few blows ran in defeat.\" \n \n \n In November 1995, five Americans were killed and 30 wounded by a car bomb in Saudi Arabia set by Muslim extremists. \n \n \n Clinton, advised by Dick Clarke, did nothing. \n \n \n In June 1996, a U.S. Air Force housing complex in Saudi Arabia was bombed by Muslim extremists. \n \n \n Clinton, advised by Dick Clarke, did nothing. \n \n \n Months later, Saddam attacked the Kurdish-controlled city of Erbil. \n \n \n Clinton, advised by Dick Clarke, lobbed some bombs into Iraq hundreds of miles from Saddam\\'s forces. \n \n \n In November 1997, Iraq refused to allow U.N. weapons inspections to do their jobs and threatened to shoot down a U.S. U-2 spy plane. \n \n \n Clinton, advised by Dick Clarke, did nothing. \n \n \n In February 1998, Clinton threatened to bomb Iraq, but called it off when the United Nations said no. \n \n \n On Aug. 7, 1998, U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were bombed by Muslim extremists. \n \n \n Clinton, advised by Dick Clarke, did nothing. \n \n \n On Aug. 20, Monica Lewinsky appeared for the second time to testify before the grand jury. \n \n \n Clinton responded by bombing Afghanistan and Sudan, severely damaging a camel and an aspirin factory. \n \n \n On Dec. 16, the House of Representatives prepared to impeach Clinton the next day. \n \n \n Clinton retaliated by ordering major air strikes against Iraq, described by The New York Times as \"by far the largest military action in Iraq since the end of the Gulf War in 1991.\" \n \n \n The only time Clinton decided to go to war with anyone in the vicinity of Muslim fanatics was in 1999 - when Clinton attacked Serbians who were fighting Islamic fanatics. \n \n \n In October 2000, our warship, the USS Cole, was attacked by Muslim extremists. \n \n \n Clinton, advised by Dick Clarke, did nothing. \n \n \n \n PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH, REPUBLICAN \n \n Bush came into office telling his national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, he was \"tired of swatting flies\" - he wanted to eliminate al-Qaida. \n \n \n On Sept. 11, 2001, when Bush had been in office for barely seven months, 3,000 Americans were murdered in a savage terrorist attack on U.S. soil by Muslim extremists. \n \n \n Since then, Bush has won two wars against countries that harbored Muslim fanatics, captured Saddam Hussein, immobilized Osama bin Laden, destroyed al-Qaida\\'s base, and begun to create the only functioning democracy in the Middle East other than Israel. Democrats opposed it all - except their phony support for war with Afghanistan, which they immediately complained about and said would be a Vietnam quagmire. And now they claim to be outraged that in the months before 9-11, Bush did not do everything Democrats opposed doing after 9-11. \n \n \n What a surprise.",

What I care about is all the lose ends he found that they should have done something about.  The truth getting the system to work better that is what I'm interested in not all of this kids whining that you do well at.\n\n \n \n If he'd wanted to tell the truth, he wouldn't have skipped over all of this:\n \n Clinton's role in the downfall of WTC\n http://www.newsmaxstore.com/nms/showdetl.cfm?&DID=6&Product_ID=876&CATID=1&GroupID=1\n \n Please read the whole link before blathering again.\n \n It's called Catastrophe: Clinton's Role in America's Worst Disaster - and tells the real story of 9/11 - the one the big media are afraid to report. \n \n Catastrophe begins on January 20, 1993, when William Jefferson Clinton took the oath of office as the 42nd president of the United States of America. Clinton swore to \"preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States\" from enemies both foreign and domestic. \n \n During the next eight years, Bill Clinton would preside over the most corrupt administration in American history. He would be only the second president in American history to be impeached. \n \n When Bill Clinton took office, American supremacy on the world stage had never been so great and unchallenged. Our military was without equal. The economy was beginning a record boom. \n \n Soon after Bill Clinton left office, Americans began to discover his bitter legacy. \n \n Even as Clinton was leaving Washington, the American economy had begun to move into a serious recession. \n \n And America's belief in invulnerability was shattered on September 11, 2001, when 19 Arab hijackers slammed civilian jets into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. \n \n As Catastrophe: Clinton's Role in America's Worst Disaster demonstrates, the events of September 11 not only were predictable after eight years of Clinton, but they also could have been prevented. \n \n Catastrophe exposes what really happened during the Clinton years, and how Bill Clinton and his administration systematically undermined America's national security by emasculating the U.S. military and the nation's intelligence agencies. \n \n Bill Clinton made America vulnerable to attack. \n \n Here are just some of the revelations from Catastrophe: \n \n Clinton's own admission that he could have extradited Osama bin Laden from Sudan - but he didn't because he felt bin Laden was not a threat! If you don't believe this, read his verbatim comments from our exclusive tape recording! \n A senior CIA officer goes on record to reveal that Bill Clinton helped Saddam Hussein by allowing him to illegally sell oil - and make billions to stay in power. \n Clinton adviser Dick Morris says that Clinton was warned about the terrorist bombings against American troops at the Khobar Towers - and he ignored the warning! \n The FBI and CIA could have easily foiled the 9-11 attacks - but were negligent as two known terrorists gained entry into the U.S. with the CIA's full knowledge. They would later participate in the 9-11 attacks. \n FBI agent Coleen Rowley says the FBI could have prevented 9-11, but refused to get a search warrant on one of the 9-11 terrorists. \n NewsMax broke the story that Bill Clinton tied the hands of the CIA and FBI - hear from agents on the inside who broke the story on NewsMax and reveal what really happened. \n Bill Clinton refused to require driver's licenses to expire at the time of expiring visas. If he had done this, one of the 9-11 terrorists would have been arrested or deported. \n The 1996 Clinton-Gore airline safety commission set the stage for 9-11. \n Why Clinton's adviser Dick Morris says Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky helped Osama bin Laden survive and plot 9-11 \n Read Bill Clinton's shocking statements about America's guilt in 9-11 - he even blamed America for 9-11 and cited our treatment of the Indians and Muslims during the Crusades! \n A secret 1994 terrorism report warned of suicidal hijackings - and Bill Clinton ignored it. \n And there is much, much more in Catastrophe, including: \n \n There is strong evidence that the West Nile virus was the first bioweapon used by Iraq. Did you know the first cases appeared near the United Nations in New York and that a major Iraqi defector said Saddam bragged in 1997 he would release the West Nile virus on America? \n A top economics adviser to Russia's President Putin warned on the front page of Pravda, just months before 9-11, that a catastrophic \"financial attack\" on the U.S. economy would take place. She has new warnings about the future. \n The Russian government officially told its citizens to cash out dollars in the months after 9-11 - and warned of an economic collapse. Did it have advance knowledge? \n Two top U.S. military commanders have warned that weapons of mass destruction will be used in the new war on terrorism. \n FEMA has a secret plan to build emergency cities that could house millions of Americans - after our cities are attacked by weapons of mass destruction. \n New evidence exists that al-Qaeda acquired small nuclear weapons in the late 1990s. \n Why is Warren Buffet predicting a nuclear attack on a U.S. city? \n China's hidden ties with the Taliban and al-Qaeda are revealed, along with new evidence that China was providing arms and intelligence to both groups even after 9-11. \n A senior Senate aide goes on the record to say that senators and congressman will never investigate the FBI's role in 9-11 - they are too afraid the FBI will blackmail them. \n Catastrophe is a wake-up call to Americans. This is the book that reveals the real story - without media censorship. \n \n Gen. Jack Singlaub says, \"Every American needs to get and read Catastrophe. It reveals Bill Clinton's role in 9-11 and what America must do to prevent future attacks.\"",

   "My estimation of Clarke is that he's an angry, disgruntled ex-employee with an axe to grind with the Bush administration. He wanted a position where he would be 'the man,' directly briefing the president. He didn't get it when Bush came into office, he instead got a less glamorous role than he had during Clinton's term.\n \n Have you even read any of the criticism of Clarke? He's got a credibility problem. He's said different and contradictory things about both Bush and Clinton. He praised George Bush's handling of terrorism, saying he increased our capabilities 'five-fold.' He was critical of Clinton's handling of it. When he resigned, he had nothing but good things to say to Bush about his leadership, is conviction, etc etc. Then the hearings start, and what people want is to see blood on the administration's hands. They want someone to hang, a witch to burn. Clarke is a smart guy, so he writes a book about the failings of the Bush team. He claims they were incompetent, bumbling fools, that they never treated terrorism as a real threat like Bill Clinton had. He even went so far as to claim that Condi Rice had apparently never heard of al-Qaeda before he told her about it, which is kinda funny, considering there is a tape of her discussing bin Laden's organization a year and a half before he claimed to have told her.\n \n Sglaine, I think you see only what you want to see. You want to see George Bush as an idiot, his team as crooked and corrupt Republicans. You'll listen to absolutely anybody who has charges to make against the administration, regardless of the validity. You see corruption, arrogance, incompetence...only because that's what you want to see!",
