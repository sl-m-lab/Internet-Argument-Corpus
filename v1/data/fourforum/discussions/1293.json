   "I got to wondering, why do you all who post on the abortion threads, debate so much about abortion? What made you start thinking about the subject, and what keeps you going on debating about it? This is for people on both sides of the subject, and it's NOT for debating abortion! I am just curious. Some people think it's too controversial of a subject, others never thought about it much, etc. We seem to have a going interest in it.\n \n For myself, I've always loved newborns and children, and I couldn't agree with abortion and love newborns. It wasn't possible for me. I started thinking about abortion, maybe, 4 years ago, and it took off from there. I was raised in a pro-life family, but abortion was never really talked about in either way, as far back as I remember. The more I looked into abortion, the more strongly I stood against it. Why do I debate? I like talking to people and debating in general. ;) Also, if you can't talk about what you believe in, it's not of really any use to believe strongly in then; and debating makes you think about the subject you're talking about more too... and it educates you in many ways.",

   "I really love young children too. (haven't been around newborns much :) ) I think the first thing that made me reject abortion is the thought that a late term abortion is killing a human who is so much like a newborn. I've heard one or two programs about it on Focus on the Family and that's what really started my debating juices flowing. I went and looked for a debate thread on abortion not long after that. I'm not sure if anyone I'm close to has been pro-choice, until I started debating it never really crossed my mind that someone could support abortion. I really agree with what you said about it making you think, Liesbeth.\n \n I think that life is so precious, it hurts to think that our supposedly human rights loving societies have murdered more people than many mass murderers who led authoritarian countries. So the main reason for me to debate is my hope to make a difference - especially if I could get someone to think twice about something that a lot of people have horrible guilt about.",

   "I was raised in a catholic household, one of several children. Although my mother supports the right to choose, she obviously never considered her own circumstances to warrant it. I disagreed. I was vehemently against abortion... as a child. As an adult I have converted to buddhism, seeing it as the only religion that not only wants it's followers to think for themselves, but to understand what it is that makes them think that way at all...\n As I grew up and since I have often been around children, and I love them very much. But I have seen firsthand the difference between a child who has been wanted, loved, and nurtured, and those that are seen as a burden, or worse. Who am I to sentence an unwanted child to a life of abuse and neglect? I beleive that we have the responsibility not only to protect life, but to protect a person's quality of life. Millions of children around the world are suffering... I would like to see to them before I worry about a child that isn't even born.\n When I grew up I found out that life is never cut and dry. I realized that people are often faced with horrible decisions, placed in dangerous predicaments, saddled with unimaginable medical problems, etc.\n I could no longer sit back comfortably in my easy chair judging people for these decisions.\n Someone mentioned the guilt some women feel after having an abortion, this is understandable, it is a huge decision and a huge loss. Most women I know who have had the procedure regret not their decision, but the circumstances that made their decision for them. Most women would not have chosen abortion if matters of their life had been more welcoming to the idea. And most people who support abortion, or I should say, a woman's right to abortion, would never undergo the procedure themselves.\n People who had the children have regrets as well. I don't know a single parent who doesn't feel guilt about something concerning their child.\n \n Basically, I grew up to realize that life is tough, and everyone struggles. As Americans I believe we were endowed with not only the right to decide our own future, but with the responsiblity of ensuring those rights for future generations.",
