   "I get scoffed at and ridiculed for my belief in a recent creation. But unlike Darwinists' faith in beneficial random mutations, my belief is based on more than blind faith. There is some stunning evidence out there for people who want to look into it. The truth is, science and the media effectively supresses, denies, hides and lies about any detail, any fragment that hints to the fact that things didn't happen the way they say they happend.\n \n So here's an overview of what I think may have happened. Please keep in mind that I simply cannot put in this post the mountains of evidence that's out there, but this will be a start. First of all, I would like you to hold in your head what I said before: that science supresses any and all information that points away from long ages, uniformatarianism, reductionism and evolution.\n -----------------------------------------------------\n \n \n I believe it's quite possible that the world was initially created much smaller than it is today, and much like mars, there were no oceans. The Bible says there was a fermament in the early days and that at some point the land masses were separated by the waters that came from the \"fountains of the deep.\" My theory is that sometime after the floods came, the earth cracked open, and the continents became separated sometime after that, leaving the oceans (some of these flood waters) in between. In short, the earth grew, much like a balloon expands, which separated the people, plants and animals.\n \n \n 100 years of science out the window: This video is mind-blowing. You HAVE to watch it....Materialists will hate it with every fiber of their body. I would strongly suggest watching this first, before reading the rest of my post -- it's very entertaining and just a few minutes long and will give you a backdrop from where I'm coming from:\n \n http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7592727299684964168\n \n Of course, this video still says it took the earth millions of years to change.....(to grow). But with a little investigative work, (which is reported below) one could deduce that this may not necessarily be the case: \n \n Anyone ever wonder where the American Indians came from - how they got here? Science says waves of small groups crossed over the imaginary Bering straight bridge 10-12,000 years ago.....across Northern Russian pack ice, and in the middle of sub-freezing, and no-doubt, blizzards-like conditions. Of course they don't bother telling people that \"no artifacts or archaeological sites of appropreate age have ever been found on the land areas which adjoin the now sunken Bering Bridge in Siberia or in the interior Alaska.\" American Genesis Jeffrey Goodman, Ph.D. Pg. 60\n \n Nor do they tell people that the bulk of the early Indian settlements just happen to be congregated up and down each coastline, leaving the expanse in the middle of the country less settled). This would lead the average person to conclude that the coastlines in the americas may have been close to the coastlines in Africa and Asia at one point. Either that or we had some ancient-history sailors, floating across the Atlantic and Pacific oceans -- and lots of them.\n \n Not only that, but science doesn't tell people that there have been ancient indian sites in the Americas uncovered, which the strata dates back to between 300,000 and 400,000 years....this would put the American Indian alive and well at the same time as the oldest Neanderthals in Europe.\n \n http://www.springerlink.com/content/m134738631885372/#search=%22Diatom%20evidenc\n \n this guy at an archeaology site says the recently-given, unannounced dates are up to 1 million years old: (Please keep in mind science tells us that people have only occupied the Americas for about 12,000 years. Some say a bit more....but nothing like this:\n \n http://www.online-archaeology.co.uk/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=1927&#1132 (see top post)\n \n And of course science loves to tell people about the Dinosaurs - big lizards. But what many people may not know is that on the American continent 10,000 years ago there were also giant bears, giant camels, giant beavers (the size of a bear) giant dragon flies, giant alligators, giant elephants, sloth, bison, and many many more megafauna. Doesn't it make sense that all the large mammals lived at the same time as the large lizards??? (By the way, how did Camels and sloths and Elephants get to America -- did they mosey their way across the Bering Straight???....what did they eat?)\n \n http://www.modomedia.com/quantum/livinlarge.html\n \n Nor do they tell people that along with countless humungous animals, the American Continent also was the home of humungous people! Giants. (Seems the Bible mentions something about giants more than once, right?) \n \n http://www.mysteriousworld.com/Journal/2003/Summer/Giants/ (don't miss the numerous links at the bottom....MORE mind-blowing stuff here.)\n \n \n And isn't it strange that there are completely fossilized African-type negoid skull uncovered in South America dated at 11,000 years ago? How strange that this didn't make headline news!! Did these people paddle thousands of miles over the Atlantic Ocean on their canoes? \n \n http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50B1EFD3F5C0C758EDDA90994D1494D81\n \n DISPLAYING ABSTRACT - Fossilized skull displayed at National Museum in Rio de Janeiro after two decades in storage has now been identified by Brazilian scientists as oldest human remains ever recovered in Western Hemisphere; is that of young woman, nicknamed Luzia, who is believed to have roamed savannah of south-central Brazil some 11,500 years ago; her features appear to be Negroid rather than Mongoloid, suggesting that Western Hemisphere may have initially been settled not only earlier than thought, but by people distinct from ancestors of today's North and South American Indian of Dr Walter Neves with Luzia's skull\n \n So we have Africans living in South America just a few thousand years ago. Who knew?\n \n \n Not only that, but if a human skull can completely fossilize in 11,000 years (or less), what does that tell us about the fact that dinosaur bones are fossilized? You got it - jack squat. Of course Scientists will date dinosaurs by the \"strata\" their bones are found in....but what \"strata\" is laying on top of the ground??? And why did American Indians write so many stories about interacting with dinosaurs? Why did they draw them on cave walls? Why are dinosaur depicted on pottery? How are unfossilized dinosaur bones found laying on top of the ground in Alaska? How are dinosaurs sculpted into walls in Ethiopia? How is dinosaur soft tissue still around after 65 - 200 million years?\n \n \n And does anyone think it's odd that people in South America built pyramids very similar to the way the did in Egypt? And China...?...and other places around the world? If people inhabited the Americas only a few thousand years ago, how did they just happened to build pyramids like the egyptians did thousands of years earlier?? \n \n http://member.hitel.net/~Haeju/photos/n_amer/aztec_h2d.jpg\n \n \n Isn't it strange how there's a freaking pyramid at the bottom (1200 feet down) of the dang Atlantic Ocean? \n \n http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_bermuda_5c.htm#bimini_road\n \n \n And isn't it strange that there are cities near Japan that submerged\n \n Underwater cities near Japan Supressed by American Media\n \n http://www.cyberspaceorbit.com/phikent/japan/japan2.html\n \n One of the greatest discoveries in the history of archaeology was made last summer, off Japan There, spread over an amazing 311 miles on the ocean floor, are the well-preserved remains of an ancient city. Or at the very least, a number of closely related sites. \n \n Finally...remember at the top I was talking about the \"Fountains of the Deep.\" Well...that would tend to fit nicely with this:\n \n 3-D model shows big body of water in Earth's mantle \n \n seismologist at Washington University in St. Louis has made the first 3-D model of seismic wave damping - diminishing - deep in the Earth's mantle and has revealed the existence of an underground water reservoir at least the volume of the Arctic Ocean. It is the first evidence for water existing in the Earth's deep mantle. \n \n http://www.physorg.com/news90171847.html\n \n If you're looking for more videos on earth explansion, there are numerous here:\n \n http://www.nealadams.com/nmu.html\n \n and this one is very entertaining too: http://www.4threvolt.com/EEmovie2.html",

   "So my contention is that all the continents may have been together in the not-so-distant past. If all the continents were together, and there were no oceans...then that would mean that there probably were no ice caps....(since it takes large volumes of water to make that much ice)...also, as some have suggested their may have been a \"mist\" or some sort of water canopy around the earth, which would keep the earth warm and humid from pole to pole.\n \n Of course we know that animals roamed on all continents. Recently some dinosaur bones were found on antarctica....so whenever the dinosaurs roamed was obviously a warm climate, not a frigid ice box....and obviously the dinosaurs had the GET there, so the continents had to be together. So the question is, WHEN did antarctica freeze over....? If antarctica was not frozen over several thousand years ago, and animals/humans roamed there, then it would make sense that it may not have been in its current position.\n \n this is a must read...............\n \n http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Troy/6396/lightfall051.htm\n \n Unbelievable as it may appear, the evidence nevertheless indicates that some ancient people explored the coasts of Antarctica when its coasts were free of ice.'",

You are in no better position than I am. You don't know anymore than I do. Science has admitted that antarctica was much warmer several thousand years ago...not only that but the following map shows that the continent was not frozen. And if it was not frozen several hundreds years ago....and it was not frozen 4-5,000 years ago, as it was stated on this next seal link, then it's pretty safe to say that animals and humans could have both been there in recent history (within a few thousand years.)

You HAVE to watch it....Materialists will hate it with every fiber of their body.\n\n \n Hmmm.\n \n Ok, look, I'll deal with this as seriously as I know how. \n \n First of all, the Pangea theory already puts the continents together in a single lump, yes? So most of the congruencies between the edges of continents are not particularly controversial. The extra ones he's postulating - well, there are some pretty serious contortions involved and no very good reason for accepting them.\n \n However, that's not my biggest problem. These are:\n \n Oceans cover 71% of the earth's surface. To create a sphere with only 29% of the surface area you would have to shrink the earth to around half its present diameter, reducing its mass to only 15% of what it is now and causing some unfortunate side effects like losing all our atmosphere and the moon. In addition, none of our fossil evidence would make sense because it's all of a proportion to withstand one standard G, not 0.15G.\n \n More seriously, there's the geometric changes involved. The animation shows all the continents sliding peacefully away from one another - however, consider the continent of Africa. On the earth as it is today, it covers almost seventy degrees of arc in both directions. On an earth half the size it would cover almost a hundred and forty - pretty near spanning a whole hemisphere. \n \n The easiest way to demonstrate why this would be a problem is for you to go get a kid's minature football (soccer ball, if you insist) and a basket ball. Cut a roughly Africa-shaped patch out of the soccer ball, covering about 140 degrees side to side and top to bottom, and try to paste it onto the surface of the basketball. I'm sure just thinking about it you can see why it's not going to work: the sharper curvature forces it up in the middle, and the only way to get around that is to make cuts in from the edges to allow them to spread out. We can even calculate how much: a shape subtending 70 degrees on a full-size sphere has (roughly) a 14% longer perimeter than a shape subtending 140 degrees on a half-size sphere. Yet Africa has almost no major rivers leading into its heart; no indication of geological 'stretch marks' whatsoever. \n \n It's a fun idea, but totally, totally barmy :)",

   "As we all know, science has admitted that the continents were all together at some point in the past. The breakup of Pangea supposedly happened some 100 million years ago -- long before monkeys supposedly evolved. And monkeys have been said to originate in Africa some 30 million years ago.

(There's not one shred of evidence of this)... Did they sail across the Atlantic Ocean?\n\n \n We don't really know.

It happened in the late Cretaceous. You are also quite sloppy in your use of the word \"monkey.\" Perhaps African monkeys evolved only 30 million years ago, but certainly primates from which the monkeys evolved are much older. That's why South American monkeys and African monkeys are so different.\n \n A better question would be how those monkeys got to South America from the ark that was at the top of a mountain in Turkey. Did Noah drop them off on the way or did they build boats and sail across the Atlantic?",
