   "One of the reasons why the United States government has adopted its pose as the Santa Claus of democracy (a gift of which it wishes to present to all those curious nations that don't have it), is a misplaced or even fatal confidence in the intrinsic superiority of American political institutions, American social morality, and American capitalism - i.e. when compared to any other cultural norms or ways in which a society might be governed etc. \n \n This superiority is conceived of as a self-evident truth; and what is virtually unimaginable therefore, is that certain \"backward\" nations might be reluctant to embrace the American model of a civil society. \n \n Assuming this (axiomatic) superiority, the American public is naturally appalled by the distressing \"ingratitude\" or even antipathy of nations who won't get in line and gladly take the political and economic gifts that the US wishes to press upon them - for their own good ! It is provoking when at great expense of time and effort, Americans arrive carrying sacks of mercy only to find the recipients eager to bite the hands that help them. We may see all this as their folly, and they may even agree - but at least it's their own brand of folly. \n \n So what's to be done ? There's always disengagement and the waiting game: let the medieval theocracies \"catch up\" in their own time and in their own way etc. Meanwhile, discard the fantasy of \"creating democracies\" all over the place and pursue a realistic policy of free trade and very limited aid so that indigenous wealth producers can begin creating the surpluses which are at the foundation of advanced economies.",
