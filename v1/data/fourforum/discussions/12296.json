But you have no issues proclaiming that it is me who is ignorant just for posting conflicting opinions regarding a theory which has never been absolutely substantiated in any way at all. Here's the rejection letter and his response to it. Ig needn't even be pointed out that he doesn't agree with your interpretation of it at all. \n The rejection letter\n \n \n prd@aps.org to davidn \n 2008 Mar 27\n Dear Dr. Noel:\n \n I am writing in reference to your manuscript \"A new model for the origin of cosmic microwave background radiation''. \n \n Physical Review D does not, in general, publish papers on speculative alternatives to or reinterpretations of currently accepted theories unless stringent requirements are met. Papers that lie outside the mainstream of current research must justify their publication by including a clear and convincing discussion of the motivation for the new speculation, with reasons for introducing any new concepts. \n \n This discussion should be at a level of detail and precision comparable to that of the accepted theory, and should be at a level of discourse appropriate to the current state of research in the field. If the new formulation results in contradictions with the accepted theory, then there must be both a discussion of what experiments could be done to show that the conventional theory needs improvement, and an analysis showing that the new theory is consistent with existing experiments. \n \n Upon reading your manuscript, I conclude that your paper does not satisfy all of these requirements. I regret to inform you that it is therefore not suitable for publication in Physical Review D. \n \n Sincerely, \n \n (name)\n Editor, Physical Review D \n \n ======================================================================================\n \n \n \n The above matter deserves comment, not particularly on the subject matter of the article, but because of what it reveals about the likely treatment of new concepts by the established scientific community.\n \n These comments are made, not in the sense of grievance or complaint, but in the spirit of analyzing what happens in the real world of science, as opposed to the public image of how it operates. This topic can be as interesting and surprising as any area of hard science.\n \n I have suggested elsewhere that \"the 'Peer Review System' works, in science and elsewhere, only up to a certain level of orthodoxy. Above that, it hits the floor level where live those who would be disadvantaged by a change in the status quo\".\n \n How the Establishment may react to perceived threats against the status quo is graphically illustrated by the rejection letter above. Looking closely at this, it can be seen that it sets up some truly amazing barriers against a perceived assault.\n \n The requirement to explain the 'motivation' for submitting a new idea is the most obvious. Even with some experience in presenting new ideas, I was taken aback by the brazenness of this concept.\n \n Look then at the passage: \"Papers ... must justify their publication by including a clear and convincing discussion ... at a level of detail and precision comparable to that of the accepted theory, and should be at a level of discourse appropriate to the current state of research in the field.\" \n \n It would be impossible, for a new idea, to satisfy such a requirement. By definition, a new idea cannot come with all the critical background of an established theory. If such a background existed, the idea would not be new.\n \n The name of the editor sending the rejection letter has not been specified, for a particular reason. I suspect that the rejection is generated, not by the views of a specific person, but by the complex of forces acting on that person. That is, the 'Establishment Apparatus' would force the editor, perhaps unconsciously and by the operation of unwritten forces not obvious even within the Apparatus, to such a conclusion.\n \n The CMBR concept put forward above appears rather specialist and not especially controversial. But a capable scientist in the field would realize that it has implications which could act as a bombshell under the 'conventional wisdom' applicable to the structure, nature, and history of the Universe.\n \n These implications are followed up in a Web article, 'The Placid Universe Model', which is at The Placid Universe Model. This latter article is intended for a general audience, rather than a specialist one, and the expectation is that anyone who studied high-school physics should have no difficulty with it. Even so, I believe that the scientific basis of this article is sound.\n ",

My point is that the interpretations based on unproven theories can be interpreted not only multiple ways, but an infinite number of ways. But since a theorist literally dreamed up the big bang back in the 20s, and it sounded rational, every cosmologist since then has applied every new observation to it in the hope of confirming it. Never considering that the original theory was never supported by any solid or verifiable evidence to begin with. And sheeple like you will defend that dung as if you have seen evidence for any of it.\n \n \nWhen a scientist or researcher makes a statement, that is what they are saying.\n\n \n Then why are you calling the opposing theories I have posted amateurish and nothing more than a school paper? Have you tested his theory? Did you even read it completely? Did you seriously consider the possibility that it could have merit? Since you responded with your insults so soon after posting it, I doubt you considered it seriously at all. \n \n Consider Einstein's first paper: He wrote it at 15 or 16 and sent it to his uncle and is considered his earliest work of the special theory of relativity. How sad if some sanctimonious pseudo intellectual like you had just disregarded his theories because they didn't agree with the status quo of the period. Einstein was first published when he was only 26 years old. So I ask you, Do you have any evidence that David Noel isn't another Einstein? I think not. But that doesn't stop you, someone who isn't even qualified to judge the scientific viability of his opinion to judge him as nothing more than having produced a high school quality paper.\n \n http://www.worldscibooks.com/phy_etextbook/4454/4454_chap1.pdf\n \n \nIf thet are properly supported by the evidence.\n\n \n You mean the evidence which fits into the box of your preconceived expectations, notions and outcomes. Anything that goes outside of that box must be written by an ignoramus.\n \n \nNo, it was rejected because it's a bloody high school paper. He submitted a paper to a journal which references wikipedia, for christ's sake!\n\n \n Prove that by discrediting the paper on the merits of its science, not on the sources it references. Wiki is a lot more info to go on than Einstein had for source material when he wrote his first paper at 15 years old, yet I doubt you will question his work. You are just proving that you are a sanctimonious and condescending pseudo intellectual bully who will attack a paper you can't personally even refute intellectually since you lack the knowledge to do so. How stupid and pompous is that tq? Here are his references, discredit them if you can.\n 1. Cosmic microwave background radiation. Cosmic microwave background radiation - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n 2. Black body. Black body - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n 3. Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe. Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n 4. Siegfried, T. Strange Matters: undiscovered ideas at the frontiers of space and time. Berkley Books, NY, 2002\n 5. Noel, D. The Placid Universe Model (2008). The Placid Universe Model.\n \n \nOf course I'm calling him an amateur. It's obvious he is!\n\n \n WOW!!! With evidence like this, I'm sure impressed with your detailed critique of this mans paper. \n \n \nIt's never been absolutely substantiated that the earth revolves around the sun either. However, all the evidence points to it. And there are many, many reasons to consider you ignorant. Posting conflicting opinions doesn't even make the list.\n\n \n Again, WOW, and you called me stupid above? Hey tq, let me clue you in on a well known scientific secret; it has been absolutely substantiated that the Earth revolves around the Sun. You should seriously consider the depth of your own ignorance before accusing me of it if you haven't learned yet that the Earth revolving around the Sun is a proven scientific fact. emoticon_rolleyes emoticon_xdonno\n \n \nWait, the guy who's \"paper\" was rejected for being too amateurish and not actually offering any insights doesn't agree with that assessment? Shocking!\n\n \n Once again all I get is a reply that ignores the facts of the point he made. And that is that any new opinion must justify their publication by including a clear and convincing discussion ... at a level of detail and precision comparable to that of the accepted theory, and should be at a level of discourse appropriate to the current state of research in the field.\" \n But\n It would be impossible, for a new idea, to satisfy such a requirement. By definition, a new idea cannot come with all the critical background of an established theory. If such a background existed, the idea would not be new.\n \n So unlike your condescending attack on someone you don't even know, the scientific publication just gave him an impossible benchmark to reach. Which totally exposes the scientific community of hypocrisy since they claim to welcome with open consideration and debate all comers who have scientific contributions to make. The criteria for the acceptance of a theory shouldn't be that it simply build on current thinking, but never dare to oppose it or else we would still be locked into the Earth being the center of the Universe.\n \n Can you see the hypocrisy tq? Probably not! But todays scientific community is as closed minded and stiff necked as the Roman Catholic Church was 400- 600 years ago when they persecuted the great thinkers of their time.",

   "The MBR is redshifted consistently with other objects in the universe, despite what the educationally challenged one seems to think. The paper is also just plain wrong \"An expanding universe would not, of itself, stretch the wavelengths of radiation travelling within it\" YES IT WOULD, that's precisely what red shift means, space itself expands, stretching the wavelengths. It's not (just) about the doppler effect of the source moving away from the receiver. Such a fundamental misunderstanding of basic cosmology suggests a real lack of education in the subject.\n \n What the author (and Archangel it seems) fails to understand is that the MBR is a well-fitting piece of a more holistic, if incomplete, theory of the early universe. The production of the MBR is consistent with our model of the early universe, as is the current presence of large proportions of lighter elements such as Hydrogen and Helium in the universe. The sign of a good scientific theory is that it accounts for a great many observed phenomena off the bat and doesn't require a great many special cases to model those phenomena. It is tested when observed phenomena contradict what the model would predict (e.g. Newtonian mechanics contradicted by the orbit of Mercury) but this does not make the theory useless, only adds special cases which in sufficient number can make the theory not worth maintaining (obvious example the ancient models of the paths taken through the skies by celestial objects, elegantly simplified by Keppler and Copernicus). The standard model of particle physics is starting to creak, the Big Bang is not. The author of Archangel's article claims there are significant problems with the Big Bang that are explained by his speculation but doesn't see fit to state them.",

My point is that the interpretations based on unproven theories can be interpreted not only multiple ways, but an infinite number of ways.\n\n No. How is this a difficult concept? Evidence can be interpreted many different ways. That does not mean that any idea that pops in your head that might explain one tiny example of a mountain of evidence deserves the same respect as a theory that explains all of the evidence. This is not a difficult concept.\n \n \nBut since a theorist literally dreamed up the big bang back in the 20s, and it sounded rational, every cosmologist since then has applied every new observation to it in the hope of confirming it.\n\n See my signature. Thanks for being the proof of its correctness.\n \n \nNever considering that the original theory was never supported by any solid or verifiable evidence to begin with.\n\n Yeah, that would be why you ran like a coward (as usual) when I embarassed you in the other thread by providing three extremely strong evidences for it. \n \n \nAnd sheeple like you will defend that dung as if you have seen evidence for any of it.\n\n Why do you consistently label those you disagree with with character flaws of your own? I have no ties to the Big Bang Theory other than it is currently the theory that best explains the available evidence. If tomorrow new evidence shows that the universe was created from the cracking of an egg layed by Gor'th Duman, The Chicken of the Cosmos, I'd go \"wow, weird.

I couldn't care less if this paper doesn't \"agree with the status quo\". It is not a scientific paper, and was rightly rejected by the journal.\n \n \nEinstein was first published when he was only 26 years old.\n\n And this is relevant in what way?\n \n \nSo I ask you, Do you have any evidence that David Noel isn't another Einstein?\n\n Do you have any that he is?

Wiki is a lot more info to go on than Einstein had for source material when he wrote his first paper at 15 years old, yet I doubt you will question his work. You are just proving that you are a sanctimonious and condescending pseudo intellectual bully who will attack a paper you can't personally even refute intellectually since you lack the knowledge to do so.

   "I think you missed the point here, Archangel. His statement does not imply that he doubts Earth's revolution about the sun. Rather, I believe he is suggesting a similarity between the type of reasoning used to establish this scientific fact with other scientific facts (e.g. biological evolution).\n \n I'm now curious: at what point in history would you say that Earth's revolution about the sun was established as scientific fact? What evidence, exactly, would you say proved this to be the case?\nGalileo espoused it until the Pope put him in prison.\n \n http://www.universetoday.com/guide-to-space/earth/the-earth-goes-around-the-sun/\n \n In ancient times, everyone thought the Earth was the center of the Universe - it was obvious to anyone who just looked up. The Sun, Moon, stars and planets were thought to be attached to crystal spheres that turned around us. We now know that the Earth goes around the Sun, but how do we know this?\n \n In astronomy, putting the Sun at the center of the Solar System is known as heliocentrism, while putting the Earth at the center is called geocentrism. As astronomers put in more and more time studying the heavens, they realized that this model didn't match reality. The Sun didn't follow an exact path every day, and the planets didn't move how they were supposed to.\n \n It wasn't until the 16th century that the Polish astronomer Copernicus developed a model that placed the Sun at the center of the Solar System. \n Until that point, astronomers had developed very complicated models that tried to explain the motions of the planets. At times they appeared to move backwards in the sky, and then go forwards again. Astronomers had developed the thought that there were spheres within spheres that could explain these motions. Copernicus simplified things, and showed that all the planets were orbiting the Sun, and the strange motions of the planets was then easy to understand as the Earth caught up and then passed them in orbit.\n \n In 1610, Galileo used his first rudimentary telescope to observe that Venus went in phases just like the Moon. This went against the theory that everything orbited the Earth, and was further evidence that it goes around the Sun. Galileo also observed how Jupiter has 4 major moons that orbit it. This broke the previous believe that all objects orbit the Earth.\n \n More precise measurements followed, and Johannes Kepler created his three laws that explained that the planets were actually following elliptical orbits around the Sun. He was the first astronomer to accurately predict a transit of Venus, where the planet was seen to pass directly in front of the Sun.\n \n The motion of the Earth as it goes around the Sun is well calculated today. Space agencies use these calculations to launch spacecraft to explore the other planets in the Solar System. If everything went around the Earth, we'd know by now.",

   "You will likely learn more about the origin of the universe from an in-depth study of scientific journals than from reading what the armchair scientists on this forum have to offer.\n \n \n THE BIG BANG\n We certainly know that our universe exists, however, this knowledge alone has not satisfied mankind's quest for further understanding. Our curiosity has led us to question our place in this universe and furthermore, the place of the universe itself. Throughout time we have asked ourselves these questions: How did our universe begin? How old is our universe? How did matter come to exist? Obviously, these are not simple questions and throughout our brief history on this planet much time and effort has been spent looking for some clue. Yet, after all this energy has been expended, much of what we know is still only speculation. \n \n We have, however, come a long way from the mystical beginnings of the study of cosmology and the origins of the universe. Through the understandings of modern science we have been able to provide firm theories for some of the answers we once called hypotheses. True to the nature of science, a majority of these answers have only led to more intriguing and complex questions. It seems to be inherent in our search for knowledge that questions will always continue to exist.\n \n Although in this short chapter it will be impossible to tackle all of the questions concerning the creation of everything we know as reality, an attempt will be made to address certain fundamental questions of our being. It will be important to keep in mind that all of this information is constantly being questioned and reevaluated in order to understand the universe more clearly. For our purposes, through an examination of what is known about the Big Bang itself, the age of the universe, and the synthesis of the first atoms, we believe that we can begin to answer several of these key questions.\n \n THE BIG BANG\n One of the most persistently asked questions has been: How was the universe created? Many once believed that the universe had no beginning or end and was truly infinite. Through the inception of the Big Bang theory, however,no longer could the universe be considered infinite. The universe was forced to take on the properties of a finite phenomenon, possessing a history and a beginning. \n \n About 15 billion years ago a tremendous explosion started the expansion of the universe. This explosion is known as the Big Bang. At the point of this event all of the matter and energy of space was contained at one point. What existed prior to this event is completely unknown and is a matter of pure speculation. This occurrence was not a conventional explosion but rather an event filling all of space with all of the particles of the embryonic universe rushing away from each other. The Big Bang actually consisted of an explosion of space within itself unlike an explosion of a bomb were fragments are thrown outward. The galaxies were not all clumped together, but rather the Big Bang lay the foundations for the universe. \n \n The origin of the Big Bang theory can be credited to Edwin Hubble. Hubble made the observation that the universe is continuously expanding. He discovered that a galaxys velocity is proportional to its distance. Galaxies that are twice as far from us move twice as fast. Another consequence is that the universe is expanding in every direction. This observation means that it has taken every galaxy the same amount of time to move from a common starting position to its current position. Just as the Big Bang provided for the foundation of the universe, Hubbles observations provided for the foundation of the Big Bang theory. \n \n Since the Big Bang, the universe has been continuously expanding and, thus, there has been more and more distance between clusters of galaxies. This phenomenon of galaxies moving farther away from each other is known as the red shift. As light from distant galaxies approach earth there is an increase of space between earth and the galaxy, which leads to wavelengths being stretched.\n \n In addition to the understanding of the velocity of galaxies emanating from a single point, there is further evidence for the Big Bang. In 1964, two astronomers, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, in an attempt to detect microwaves from outer space, inadvertently discovered a noise of extraterrestrial origin. The noise did not seem to emanate from one location but instead, it came from all directions at once. It became obvious that what they heard was radiation from the farthest reaches of the universe which had been left over from the Big Bang. This discovery of the radioactive aftermath of the initial explosion lent much credence to the Big Bang theory. \n Even more recently, NASAs COBE satellite was able to detect cosmic microwaves emanating from the outer reaches of the universe. These microwaves were remarkably uniform which illustrated the homogeneity of the early stages of the universe. However, the satellite also discovered that as the universe began to cool and was still expanding, small fluctuations began to exist due to temperature differences. These fluctuations verified prior calculations of the possible cooling and development of the universe just fractions of a second after its creation. These fluctuations in the universe provided a more detailed description of the first moments after the Big Bang. They also helped to tell the story of the formation of galaxies which will be discussed in the next chapter. \n \n The Big Bang theory provides a viable solution to one of the most pressing questions of all time. It is important to understand, however, that the theory itself is constantly being revised. As more observations are made and more research conducted, the Big Bang theory becomes more complete and our knowledge of the origins of the universe more substantial.",

   "Originally Posted by Archangel \n ... Earth revolving around the Sun is a proven scientific fact. \n\n Actually, to be strictly accurate, the Earth and Sun revolve around each other. The gravity of the Earth acts on the Sun in the same way as the gravity of the Sun acts on the Earth. So, they both revolve around a point which is somewhere between their relative centres. If they had equal masses, they would revolve around a point half way between them. However, as the Sun is far more massive than the Earth, the point about which they revolve is much closer to the centre of the Sun than it is to that of the Earth.\n \n Carry on.",

   "Sorry, didn't mean to confuse you. I don't really know any smaller words for that.\n\n \n And once again you focus on insulting me rather than the relevant part of my point which was this:  But in your mind, just denying something makes you right and me wrong. Let me repeat the relevant section of my statement for emphasis: It would never occur to you that what you blindly accept as an accurate perspective, even though it is 10-20 billion years removed from the actual event according to your own theory could possibly be wrong, right? And it is absolutely correct in defining how you think. You will always choose insults and sarcasm over substance.\n \n \nArchie, when you tell me what I think, I think \"wrong\" is more than an acceptable answer. Especially when you've made it quite clear that you won't let anything change your mind.\n\n \n It's only because what you think is so shallow and predictable, when you give one word snarky responses, it only seems right to attempt to express a thought or two for you.\n \n \nOh Archie, I've never had respect for you.\n\n \n It should be obvious that the feeling is mutual tq, but once again, I said showing respect, not having respect. Why is it impossible for you to comprehend even the simplest statement?\n \n \nYeah, that would be why you ran like a coward (as usual) when I embarassed you in the other thread by providing three extremely strong evidences for it. \n\n \n Ran like a coward, away from you? emoticon_xdonno My Lord man, don't you get it that we have nothing to gain or lose in these debates? If I stopped responding at all, it was because it was going in the same direction as this exchange and I see no reason to get into a perpetual ####### match with you.\n \n \n Why do you consistently label those you disagree with with character flaws of your own? \n\n \n How unimaginative are you anyway tq? You pick up on smileys sarcasm and must build on it here. But what neither of you are smart enough to get is that smileys quote was of the articles author and not by me at all. Just another example of the dishonesty I must endure around here.\n \n \n I have no ties to the Big Bang Theory other than it is currently the theory that best explains the available evidence. If tomorrow new evidence shows that the universe was created from the cracking of an egg layed by Gor'th Duman, The Chicken of the Cosmos, I'd go \"wow, weird. But it all fits, so that must be correct (again-based on what we currently know).\n\n \n Then we should have had no reason to butt heads today since I have no faith or commitment to the opposing theories I posted. I just posted them to show that opposing theories exist. You know where I stand on how Creation came into being.\n \n \nYou haven't posted any \"opposing theories\". You posted some guys paper off the internet!\n\n \n I posted 2 opposing theories. Was Einstein's paper which he sent to his uncle at 15 years old any less a theory just because only he and his uncle read it? For someone who claims an understanding of the scientific method you are truly clueless.\n \n \n \nReally? It's not all that tough to read 50-75 lines of text, consider it, and reject it as amateurish in a short period of time.\n\n \n Sure it is, if you don't have any idea what he's suggesting. Which you don't have a clue about.\n \n \nReally, this is just pathetic. I couldn't care less if this paper doesn't \"agree with the status quo\". It is not a scientific paper, and was rightly rejected by the journal.\n\n \n Talks cheap, why not prove it.\n \n \nDo you have any that he is? And him not liking the big bang theory any more than you is not evidence of this.\n\n \n Great, you can't defend against just dismissing him as if he's some ##### even though you can't personally disprove his theory so in typical fashion you just reverse it and put the question on me. Well I didn't insult the guy so I haven't questioned his capability to write a theory.\n \n And who say's that either of us don't like the big bang theory? I have nothing against it at all. I just know that none of it has been proven or is based on any absolute results which can only be interpreted to support it only as a means of creating the universe. That's all. It's nothing personal with me at all.\n \n \nYou're right, I'm a layman. And yet, I can see why this paper was rejected. What does that tell you?\n\n \n It tells me that you're a legend in your own mind. emoticon_xgood\n \n \nAgain, wrong. How is it that you can continually ignore what I'm saying and think that you're correct?\n\n You said this:If thet are properly supported by the evidence.\n in response to this statement from my previous post which said this:What is incredible is that your side will claim that all new theories and opinions are readily accepted into the public domain for consumption and debate in order to learn and expand current beliefs.And I responded with this, right on point.\n You mean the evidence which fits into the box of your preconceived expectations, notions and outcomes. Anything that goes outside of that box must be written by an ignoramus.\n So I understood you just fine and have been consistent in my responses. It's you who changes your tune from one post to the next.\n \n \nTell you what Binky-support it if you can. It's your assertion that this supports your position. Tell us how.\n\n \n Once again binky, I don't hold to either theory and you should know thatby now if you had half a brain. But it is you who has judged and insulted this guy without knowing anything about him or understanding his theory.\n \n \nNo, you got a reply that points out that he's probably not the most objective party to be found.\n\n \n Now who's running away? You have done nothing but insult this guy in your typical condescending way when you couldn't prove or disprove what he wrote if your life depended on it.\n \n \nIt's impossible to support your hypothesis with evidence, and to a detail wholly expected by science?\n \n \n Are you completely dense tq? This isn't MY hypothesis in any way. All I've done is post a couple of theories whch oppose the big bang on principle to show that what you believe is by no means universally accepted. Nothing I have posted reflects my personal beliefs. \n \n \nSo your thought is that it's more accurate to disregard thousands of years of observation and just make stuff up?\n\n \n Now you're just straight out admitting you're as dense as a lead ball, aren't you tq. I posted a letter above of Einstein's first paper when he was 15 or 16 which is archived as the Golden Age of Theoretical Physics. The letter was from the late 19th century. The big bang wasn't conceived by Hubble until the 1920s. How do you get thousands of years of observations from that? \n \n Although the ancients had an impressive understanding of astronomy considering their lack of technology, the science of cosmology is still in its infancy even with what we currently know today. So to credit it with thousands of years of observations is ridiculous. But if it was true, then our friends with opposing views would still be working with the same observations in determining their theories also. \n \n \nWhatever.\n \n What a waste of time.\n\n \n Amen, which is usually the end result of any discussion with you.",

If you post something as support of your position (ie-the big bang is wrong, or \"pterodactyls were alive in Civil War times), you are taking responsibility for its accuracy and truthfulness.

How can anyone mangle a sentence so badly as to think I was stating that Hubble and Einstein were seperated by thousands of years? \n Everything we know is based on thousands of years of observation and experimentation. There are observatories in Europe over 9 000 years old, used to mark the positions of the sun and other celestial bodies. This was astronomy. We have built upon all the observations since then.\n What kind of blithering ##### are you?\n \n \nAlthough the ancients had an impressive understanding of astronomy considering their lack of technology, the science of cosmology is still in its infancy even with what we currently know today.\n\n So, people have been doing astronomy for thousands of years, which you just admit.\n \n So to credit it with thousands of years of observations is ridiculous.\n\n But it's ridiculous to say that there are thousands of years of observations...\n \n \nBut if it was true, then our friends with opposing views would still be working with the same observations in determining their theories also.\n\n How can you not get this? \n \n You and i are standing side by side.

You give a wonderfully simple analogy here in the attempt to make 2 obvious points. 1 of them is to dishonestly show how the evidence we both observe leads to one obvious conclusion which I am too ignorant to see. And the other is that I will stubbornly reject the obvious conclusions because I refuse to accept what is so glaringly undeniable to any rational person. This is why you feel justified in calling me stupid and insane.\n \n If only the issue of the big bang was so simple that the observations which are based on an event which allegedly occurred between 10 and 20 billion years ago could be overwhelmingly viewed personally by all and agreed upon universally. I repeat the questions I asked before which got no response from you or anyone at all. What your side did was change the subject.\n So tell me? \"Where did that original super dense marble of matter come from? To expand it, how did a timeless infinity of nothingness exist which was void of ANYTHING AT ALL except that marble sized ball of super dense matter\"?\n AND\n  \"What caused that marble sized ball of super dense matter to spontaneously expand into all of the matter which encompasses the known but still undefinable universe?\"\n Can you explain these questions and make your answers as simple as your childish wet horse analogy tq? Or isn't it true that you can't explain those most basic question as to how and why the big bang occurred at all? And if you can't answer \"how\" and \"why\" the big bang occurred, how can you claim \"when\" or even \"that\" it occurred as described is based in fact at all, and still attempt to maintain a semblance of objective scientific credibility?\n \n Remember, this is the approximate size of that original ball of super dense material which the big bang theory suggests expanded into all the matter that exists in the universe. I thought the marble which represented the Earth, much less the entire universe was perfectly apropos for this image.\n http://www.worldofstock.com/slides/MES1482.jpg\n A more accurate wet horse analogy would be to place two people in a sound proofed and windowless room for 2 weeks, then walk a wet horse in to them and have them determine \"how\" and precisely \"when\" it got wet. And what was the \"exact\" and specific \"method\" of it getting wet. Then, after allowing them just 5 seconds to observe the wet horse, remove it and have them also determine how long it will take it to dry. The observable evidence wouldn't be quite so obvious then, would it tq? \n \n Yet you continue to simplify the issue as if the assumptions and conclusions you come to are as obvious as the analogy you outlined. An analogy that only a simpleton couldn't recognize, which is why you made it and applied the denier role to me. An analogy which is so simplistic as to enter the realm of the incredulous. But I expect nothing more honest, objective or rational than that depth of thinking from you at this point. :xbanghead emoticon_xdonno",

Here's what the link say's.\n Despite this lack of direct evidence, it would be tempting to extrapolate further backwards and assume the big bang model to be an accurate description of the universe all the way back to the big bang. Such a complete extrapolation of the theory is not possible, however, because of certain limitations of our theories of high energy physics. When we talk about extrapolating backwards in the big bang model we are referring to running the equations of general relativity backwards to earlier times and higher densities. We know, however, that general relativity ceases to be valid when we try to describe a region of spacetime whose density exceeds a certain value known as the Planck density, roughly 1093 g/cm3. If we try to consistently apply quantum mechanics and general relativity at such a density we find that quantum fluctuations of spacetime become important, and we have no theory that describes such a situation.\n \n The Planck density is enormous. It corresponds to the mass of 100 billion galaxies being squeezed into a space the size of an atomic nucleus. If we could extrapolate general relativity all the way back to the big bang the universe would have gone from infinite density to the Planck density in roughly 10-43 seconds. So saying something happened, say, three minutes after the big bang is equivalent to saying it happened three minutes after the time the universe was at Planck density.Inflationary Cosmology: Big Bang Physics\n \n *sigh* I said it was the size of a marble when this science which admits there is NO direct evidence to support their claim, asserts that the initial mass of the universe was squeezed into the space the size of an atomic nucleus. Now go away and get a clue about the theory you're defending and then come back and support it. Your condescension which is based on ignorance is offensive. :xbanghead",

   "Is this a joke, isly ilwott? You mention an \"in-depth study of scientific journals\", but then provide a link to a web page that appears to have been made by undergraduates at the University of Michigan as a class assignment?\n \n My intention is not to criticize the link you provide. Indeed, it seems reasonable for a general audience. However, I think it is important that readers understand the difference between text posted online and actual journal articles.\n \n Further, I disagree with your assertion that those looking for a basic understanding of a field of research should refer to journal articles. They are written for specialists and are exceedingly technical, with an assumption of a large body of prior familiarity. \n \n As an example, consider this abstract from a 2001 paper by Stephen Hawking:\n \n \"A de Sitter brane-world bounding regions of anti-de Sitter space has a macroscopic entropy given by one-quarter the area of the observer horizon. A proposed variant of the AdS/CFT correspondence gives a dual description of this cosmology as conformal field theory coupled to gravity in de Sitter space. In the case of two-dimensional de Sitter space this provides a microscopic derivation of the entropy, including the one-quarter, as quantum entanglement of the conformal field theory across the horizon.\"\n \n If that makes sense to you, you're either a specialist in the field, kidding yourself or insane.\n \n Rather, non-specialists would be far better served to start at a level closer to an encyclopedia, a well-regarded general science magazine such as Scientific American, or a book written specifically for non-specialists (e.g. Hawking's _A Brief History of Time_, or something more recent).\n \n I do agree with you, however, that forums such as this are NOT a good place to get information... especially about something as inherently complicated as cosmology.\n \n \nYou will likely learn more about the origin of the universe from an in-depth study of scientific journals than from reading what the armchair scientists on this forum have to offer.\n \n \n THE BIG BANG\n",

His statement does not imply that he doubts Earth's revolution about the sun. Rather, I believe he is suggesting a similarity between the type of reasoning used to establish this scientific fact with other scientific facts (e.g. biological evolution).\n \n I'm now curious: at what point in history would you say that Earth's revolution about the sun was established as scientific fact?

The current model features a universe that is infinite in size, the inflation is within the universe. Certainly there are issues with relativity in extreme situations, but the first gaping hole in your revised argument is that there is no mass as we would understand it, we're not talking about the mass of 100 billion galaxies at all, we're talking about energy. Matter doesn't come into it for a little while after the big bang.\n \n You also fail to understand the nature of the level of physics you are dealing with.

A broken window and my stuff missing would be a \"lack of direct evidence\" but a a burglary would be a good theory until some evidence that contradicts it comes along. Modern physics works by building a model that fits observed phenomena and trying to make predictions for future observations in order to verify the model. So far, with a few tweaks, the big bang model has held up and been fleshed out. Certainly we know that at high masses the quantum effects contradict general relativity, this is the origin of Hawking radiation. You're acting, however, as if this is being ignored by physicists. In fact that very questions you're posing (though actually they have naff all to do with the big bang model) have led to hypotheses relating the big bang's origin (particularly the lumpy nature of the universe) to quantum effects in the singularity, or perturbations carried over from a previous \"big crunch\". Of course there are many physicists who assert, probably correctly, that it's not going to be possible to learn about the cause of the big bang, and many of those believe God was the first cause (my Cosmology lecturer was one).

You have all of these theories which you attempt to tie together to make sense according to your finite mind when in reality none of them explain anything in absolute terms at all. \n \n All you have gained from your alleged education is the sanctimonious attitude which carries you deeper into your own self involved ignorance.\n \n \nThe current model features a universe that is infinite in size, the inflation is within the universe.

And you further expose your limited perspective by claiming the universe is infinite. It most certainly isn't infinite as that would suggest that eternity occupies a limited space, because the universe does have measurable outer borders. Just because we can't yet measure them doesn't mean they aren't there. \n \n \nbut the first gaping hole in your revised argument is that there is no mass as we would understand it, we're not talking about the mass of 100 billion galaxies at all, we're talking about energy. Matter doesn't come into it for a little while after the big bang.\n\n \n More semantics in order to avoid admitting what I said simply was absolute correct. If that's all your education bought you then you were truly taken for a ride. Remember the The First Law of Thermodynamics ?(Conservation) states that energy is always conserved, it cannot be created or destroyed. In essence, energy can only be converted from one form into another.\n \n So in effect from this alleged big bang, all of the matter which makes up 100 billion Galaxies was created from the alleged energy release that was originally squeezed into a space the size of an atomic nucleus. And this claim is based on no observable or verifiable evidence at all as the link say's.\n \n It also say's this: Such a complete extrapolation of the theory is not possible, however, because of certain limitations of our theories of high energy physics. When we talk about extrapolating backwards in the big bang model we are referring to running the equations of general relativity backwards to earlier times and higher densities. \n \n So they are doing the math backwards based on the big bang model which they admit hasn't been proven or verified in the first place. So what we have here is one giant circle jerk of circular reasoning which is attempting to support unprovable assumptions.

The quote \"lack of direct evidence\" which is vastly different from \"no evidence\".\n\n \n What you fail to understand is that if the evidence doesn't directly support a theory it is aimed at proving then it does nothing to support the theory it is used to support. For example, When the universe first dropped below the Planck density, was it just a random collection of energy? It turns out that the answer is no according to Planck Theory. \n \n In order to give rise to a universe at all like the one we see the early universe had to have a number of very precisely tuned features. Since the big bang model says nothing about what gave rise to the initial conditions for our universe these features are simply assumed.\n \n So you see? circular reasoning at its best, yet it's me whom you say is too ignorant to appreciate the intricacies of your so called science? What does it say about you Jo, when you can't even recognize that it's junk science after years of studying the inconsistencies and contradictions in real time by yourself?

I thought the marble which represented the Earth, much less the entire universe was perfectly apropos for this image. correction for accuracy: (The Planck density is enormous. It corresponds to the mass of 100 billion galaxies being squeezed into a space the size of an atomic nucleus.)\n http://www.worldofstock.com/slides/MES1482.jpg\n \n A more accurate wet horse analogy would be to place two people in a sound proofed and windowless room for 2 weeks, then walk a wet horse in to them and have them determine \"how\" and precisely \"when\" it got wet. And what was the \"exact\" and specific \"method\" of it getting wet. Then, after allowing them just 5 seconds to observe the wet horse, remove it and have them also determine how long it will take it to dry. The observable evidence wouldn't be quite so obvious then, would it tq? \n \n Yet you continue to simplify the issue as if the assumptions and conclusions you come to are as obvious as the analogy you outlined. An analogy that only a simpleton couldn't recognize, which is why you made it and applied the denier role to me. An analogy which is so simplistic as to enter the realm of the incredulous.

Until they next serve your sides purpose in debate, then they are once again written in stone to be trusted and relied upon to prove your point. \n \n \nAny evidence for this? We know that the universe is far larger than what we can currently see.

Please go away and get a clue about the theory you're critiquing and then come back and discuss it (getting the estimated age for the universe correct would be a nice start, it's not totally pinned down but the figure of 13.7 billion years is generally thought to be pretty accurate, continuing to quote a range of 10-20 billion years is absurd) \n \n How is this focus on an insignificant aspect of my argument (which you still got wrong) answering the focussed and direct questions I asked at all? It isn't, which is the typical derailing and obfuscation I get anytime I ask a direct question which your side is incapable of answering. Change the subject and redefine the debate in order to avoid the reality of admitting how little you actually know.\n \n And regarding the underlined: The first thing that jumps out at me is how as you correct me for using the 10-20 billion year age of the universe, you then go on to say this: it's not totally pinned down but the figure of 13.7 billion years is generally thought to be pretty accurate,\n \n WOW Jo, as you insult my repeating of the published guestimate, you sure don't sound very sure of your accepted age of the universe. But that doesn't stop you from insulting my perspective even though what I said is widely accepted by sources which otherwise promote what you defend as an accurate and believable cosmological theory.

You still haven't even attempted to answer the two questions I posted to tq and to you, but have gone around them and attempted to discuss anything else but them. You have avoided \"directly responding\" to every point I have raised as you continue to defend the unprovable humanist theories rather than the spiritual perspective which clearly say's this: [Hebrews 11:3]\n 3 By faith we understand that the universe was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things that are visible.\n \n Your alleged Masters degree has blinded you to the things of God as you claim to believe in Him. You fail to comprehend that according to God, you are what you believe. Jesus said this, but evidently it means nothing to you.\n Jhn 10:25 Jesus answered them, \"I told you, and you do not believe; the works that I do in My Father's name, these testify of Me.\n \n Jhn 10:26 \"But you do not believe because you are not of My sheep.\n \n Jhn 10:27 \"My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me;\n \n Jhn 10:28 and I give eternal life to them, and they will never perish; and no one will snatch them out of My hand.\n \n Jhn 10:29 \"My Father, who has given {them} to Me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch {them} out of the Father's hand.\n \n Jhn 10:30 \"I and the Father are one.\"\n So let's not discuss God's glory and the wonder of His creation until you fully appreciate His works and are willing to give Him the glory for them, and believe His version of our creation over the shallow secular humanist version of how we evolved from lower life forms, and how this universe spontaneously erupted from the initial mass of the universe, which was squeezed into the space the size of an atomic nucleus. If you truly believed in Gods participation in all that exists, you would have at least said long ago that it was God who caused the big bang in answer to my question as to HOW it occurred. But that concept never even entered your mind because your theoretical physicist teachers never taught you that. And your complete worldview is based only in what other men have told you to think, not what Gods word say's which you claim to believe only as a matter of convenience so you can feel religious.",

My agreement or disagreement is irrelevant tq. It's his corrupted interpretation of the truth of the bible which is the issue, and that deserves comment. \n \n \nJo answered this a while back. The answer to both your questions is: We don't know.\n\n \n Really? Care to post where either of you admitted that you don't know before this very admission? Because he has danced around it focussing on anything but admitting that thus far. And you have just run away from it until finally admitting it here. My question which will also be ignored is, if we can't explain how or why this spontaneous event occurred between 10 and 20 BILLION YEARS AGO, how do we know it happened at all? Is the Planck Density theory proven absolutely? Because the whole big bang theory is founded upon that principle being true. \n \n So right here without even dealing with the big bang event itself occurring, we have the theory itself and the Planck Density theory which it rests upon being probable, as unprovable, untestable and unrepeatable concepts upon which the whole idea is based. And I say idea because that is all it is.\n \n \nAnd we'll just head your next argument off at the pass. Just because we don't know doesn't mean the big bang theory is wrong. Detectives looking at a crime scene don't know the why's either, but using evidence they can piece together the who, how, what, when and where.\n\n \n Ahhh, so once again you persist in using a current real time model as an analogy to show how obvious the deductions are that can be made for an unknown event which allegedly took place between 10 and 20 BILLION YEARS AGO. When you admit you don't know how, why, or even precisely when this event occurred. \n \n And what totally boggles my mind is that you see fit to claim I'm the ignorant one for not buying into this IDEA which is based on wishful thinking at best. All I want you guy's to admit to is that there are more holes in this overall theory than a screen window has but it's the best idea that exists right now so we continue to look in that direction for answers. If you proponents were being scientifically honest and objective you would come right out and say up front that we will be lucky to actually EVER discover the actual truth about how the universe came into being within a thousand years from now.\n \n Instead though, you insult me as if I'm an imbecile for being intelligent enough to ask questions which you can't answer. How would an imbecile have the scientific insight to ask questions which a guy who claims to have a Masters in Theoretical Physics and Mathematics can't answer tq? Can you at least answer that simple question rather than just further insult me? emoticon_rolleyes",

You prefer to hold on to your personal perspective on all major issues which oppose what Gods word say's and you couldn't care less that that's what you do.

I prefer to trust in the SOLID evidence that God reveals to us in nature (his very word written in the rocks and the fossils and the stars and the genomes, etc.). \n \n I trust God to NOT be a trickster and make things appear to be billions of years old and expect people to realise he is a lying d-bag in the REAL PHYSICAL WORLD and choose the correct cultish interpretation of the first few chapters of the bible (here I refer to the YEC cult you belong to.) which show an actual few thousand years old world.",

At this point, it looks like a 90% to 10% differentiation. I tend to place theistic evolutionists in one camp or the other after having seen them post for awhile. Do you think I'm wrong to do that?

You make assertions about my views on homosexuality that reflect a lack of comprehension on your part, you seem to think that there is only a pro-gay or an anti-gay position. As far as God's attitude towards homosexuality, I don't know what it is. What I do know is that he calls people who are actively homosexual to be priests and bishops. He also calls alcoholics, and other sinners (i.e. human beings). Whether homosexuality is a sin or not is a matter for the individual concerned to pray about and ask for God's guidance, the Church has no business interfering in that unless the sin is committed against someone else, i.e. it causes harm.

When it comes to marriage in church I think that has to be an issue for individual priests and couples, I don't think the church should make judgements on something so uncertain. I will, however, challenge Christians who try to use the Bible to justify their hatred of gays, and their lack of respect for the love that gay couples have for each other; just as I challenge the Christians who try to use the Bible to justify racism and other fascist ideologies.\n \n Somebody once described Anglicanism as having the faith to say \"I don't know\".

I have my ideas about what the explanation is, but I can't support them so I don't discuss them. The difference is that you argue whether you can support your views or not, and when you can't you resort to accusations and threats about the spiritual status of those with whom you debate. St. Paul wrote that some have the gift of inspired teaching. I'm not one of them, and (I suspect) neither are you, I don't think it is advisable to try to answer spiritual questions without that inspiration unless you already have an answer you know to be true. Even if you do know something to be true, it is always worth considering the possibility that you are wrong.\n \n As far as the Big Bang goes, if you were to actually read the thread you would know that I had already answered the question about the origin of the Big Bang, it was a very simple \"I don't know\" accompanied by outlining what I believe, and what some other hypotheses are. Now I come to think about it again, there is another issue, in that time is a property of the universe, (certainly God is not bound by it) and so cause and effect start to get a little dodgy when you get beyond it.\n \n Incidentally, given that God is not bound by time, there is nothing to prevent the Big Bang theory being an accurate description, but God also having created the world as described in Genesis. The creation of the \"past\" (not just the appearance of age but the actual past) is well within the capability of God. Also, the fact of evolution does not undermine the separation of man and beast, a defining characteristic of being human is contemplation of the divine - the first human was simply the first to talk to God, and that is more separation that anyone could ever want. Now I'm happy to discuss these sorts of issues with other believers, because this really is the realm of metaphyiscs, but I'm not going to dive into trying to defend Christian beliefs with argument and logic because they don't always stand up. The cross is a mystery to the world, and the nature of God's sacrifice, and the nature of the trinity, are paradoxical to human logic. Faith will not be achieved by the argument of theology, certainly not of the mechanical kind often engaged in by devout atheists. This is simply because the Bible is not logically consistent, and it's theology is that of the living God, not of the regimented, delineated law. Like a bridge that if you look close enough is mostly empty space, the God's word as a whole is what carries the weight of faith.",

   "Not only can those of us who believe not be snatched from God's hand, we can't be pushed out by others in his hand who believe only they are there.\n\n \n Talk about stating the obvious. Where and when did I claim to replace the Lord as the one and only judge of anyones salvation? All I have done is shown where He say's He will be that judge. \n \n \nIt is incredibly arrogant to assert that you know what the will of God is and that anyone disagreeing with your opinion is opposing God and therefore (as you have threatened) going to hell.\n\n \n Show where I threatened that anyone is going to hell Jo. You're guilty conscience and the conviction of the passages I posted is causing you to attribute to me what the bible clearly say's will happen at the judgement. Also, the bible is the book of Gods will for us, so how can you claim it's arrogant to believe His book if you are in fact claiming to have a part in His kingdom? \n \n \n You make assertions about my views on homosexuality that reflect a lack of comprehension on your part, you seem to think that there is only a pro-gay or an anti-gay position.\n\n \n My views aren't about gays at all. My views are about what the bible say's about the wrongness of HOMOSEXUALITY. The act; the practice of it as a sexual outlet. Your so called christian views focus on accepting the people and dismissing the sin. I focus on loving the individual by pointing out that the sin is the problem which separates one from Gods truth. Just as I've said hundreds of times, the same rules apply to an adulterer who is unrepentant about that sin. That doesn't mean I hate adulterers just as I don't hate homosexuals. I do hate that they are victims of the bondage this sinful sexual expression represents which is why I tell the hard truth about how destructive it is.\n \n \n As far as God's attitude towards homosexuality, I don't know what it is. What I do know is that he calls people who are actively homosexual to be priests and bishops. He also calls alcoholics, and other sinners (i.e. human beings).\n\n \n Here's the rub Jo, if you believed and trusted Gods word you would know Gods attitude about homosexuality, because He has pointed it out very clearly just as He has for all sin. My God man, He say's go and sin no more, to be like Him, walk righteously before all men. Even generally speaking His gospel message tells us that we are to seek Him above all else. Is that what you see reflected in the lives of any secular humanists who happen to also be homosexual? \n \n And please show me where the bible calls for homosexuals to be priests and bishops because I missed that chapter in Gods word.\n \n \nWhether homosexuality is a sin or not is a matter for the individual concerned to pray about and ask for God's guidance, the Church has no business interfering in that unless the sin is committed against someone else, i.e. it causes harm.\n\n \n This is absolutely wrong and a corruption of what the bible say's Jo. The proper phrasing would be \"whether a homosexual is forgiven for the clearly declared sin of homosexuality is a matter for the individual concerned to pray about and ask God's forgiveness for\". The guidance regarding it as a sin has already been absolutely declared by God in His word. \n \n And the church not only has the right but the responsibility and the authority given to it by God as the body of Christ to uphold and protect the scriptural values Gods word lays out for all of us. \n \n If the church abandons those principles, then it also abandons the great commission which God entrusted to it. That you can't see that, or choose not to, speaks volumes about your spiritual condition. That's not a judgement of condemnation either Jo, just a spiritual observation which I also have the authority and responsibility as a child of God to honestly share with you. \n \n \n I also don't believe that we have a right to impose our morality through the law. I no more think civil marriage of gay people should be prohibited than I do divorcees. When it comes to marriage in church I think that has to be an issue for individual priests and couples, I don't think the church should make judgements on something so uncertain. I will, however, challenge Christians who try to use the Bible to justify their hatred of gays, and their lack of respect for the love that gay couples have for each other; just as I challenge the Christians who try to use the Bible to justify racism and other fascist ideologies.\n\n \n The only thing I find uncertain is how you can't see that the bible clearly defines marriage as between a man and a woman. Also, how you can't see that by redefining it, we will be opening the door for other perversions of it as an institution. I also wonder why you can't see the loss of respect and the weakening of it as an institution in other countries which have redefined it. \n \n \nSomebody once described Anglicanism as having the faith to say \"I don't know\". You often question why I don't get involved in \"defending\" Christianity, a good example would be the thread discussing the problem of evil. The reason is that I don't know the answer, God does, and I'm not going to try and theologise my way out of a hole that Augustine and Aquinus couldn't manage, as I'll undoubtedly get it wrong and most likely devise an explanation that is glib or insulting to those who endure real suffering in the world. I have my ideas about what the explanation is, but I can't support them so I don't discuss them.\n\n \n If you know you are unqualified to judge spiritual issues then I respect you for not getting involved in those debates. But what is dishonest about your statement above is that you do get involved in those debates, The problem for me is that as you claim to be a christian, you ALWAYS SIDE WITH THE ATHEISTS AND SECULAR HUMANISTS AGAINST MY SCRIPTURAL PERSPECTIVE. That FACT relegates everything you said above to nothing more than cheap lip service and shallow justification for opposing the biblical perspective as you always do..\n \n \n The difference is that you argue whether you can support your views or not, and when you can't you resort to accusations and threats about the spiritual status of those with whom you debate. \n\n \n Once again you misrepresent what I do. I support what I say with the scriptures themselves just as I did above when you interpreted that as ME condemning you to hell. You once again projected onto me the responsibility for you being convicted by Gods word which never comes back void. Nothing I say regarding spiritual issues is my own opinion or beliefs unless I state up front that it is my opinion only, and not based on the scriptural evidence.\n \n \nSt. Paul wrote that some have the gift of inspired teaching. I'm not one of them, and (I suspect) neither are you, I don't think it is advisable to try to answer spiritual questions without that inspiration unless you already have an answer you know to be true. Even if you do know something to be true, it is always worth considering the possibility that you are wrong.\n\n \n Again, you are as wrong as you can be. If believers who know and study the word don't shine the light of Gods truth in a spiritually dark world, then who will Jo? BTW, every single answer I give is spiritually inspired because I'm not sharing my beliefs as you do but share Gods truths from His word. \n \n \nAs far as the Big Bang goes, if you were to actually read the thread you would know that I had already answered the question about the origin of the Big Bang, it was a very simple \"I don't know\" accompanied by outlining what I believe, and what some other hypotheses are. Now I come to think about it again, there is another issue, in that time is a property of the universe, (certainly God is not bound by it) and so cause and effect start to get a little dodgy when you get beyond it.\n\n \n I did read the thread as we went along and all I remember is you focussing on the marble size issue as you ignored the meat of the questions I asked. Also, based on every single thing you said in your explanation God had nothing to do with the big bang, so I don't know why you're trying to insert Him now. You never even considered Him as a cause or you would have attributed the \"how\" to Him the first time I asked the question.\n \n \nIncidentally, given that God is not bound by time, there is nothing to prevent the Big Bang theory being an accurate description,\n\n \n I actually don't disagree with the bolded statement. But I do disagree with your definition of how it happened and when it happened based on the available evidence when it is impossible to assure me our observations are being properly interpreted.\n \n \n but God also having created the world as described in Genesis. The creation of the \"past\" (not just the appearance of age but the actual past) is well within the capability of God.\n\n \n You need to clarify this thought. I don't know what you're trying to say here.\n \n \n Also, the fact of evolution does not undermine the separation of man and beast, a defining characteristic of being human is contemplation of the divine - the first human was simply the first to talk to God, and that is more separation that anyone could ever want. Now I'm happy to discuss these sorts of issues with other believers, because this really is the realm of metaphyiscs, but I'm not going to dive into trying to defend Christian beliefs with argument and logic because they don't always stand up.\n\n \n If I'm reading you correctly, you're saying that our evolving from lower animals doesn't impinge on our being created in Gods image as defined in Genesis. If that's what you're saying, you couldn't be more wrong as that is a total corruption of Gods plan for us as stated in Genesis.\n \n \n The cross is a mystery to the world, and the nature of God's sacrifice, and the nature of the trinity, are paradoxical to human logic. Faith will not be achieved by the argument of theology, certainly not of the mechanical kind often engaged in by devout atheists. \n\n \n See the bolded? That is the crux of Gods truth. The truth and reality of the Cross is an absolute mystery to the world, and the verses I posted above go to the very heart of that matter. Jesus said:Jhn 10:26 \"But you do not believe because you are not of My sheep.\n \n Jhn 10:27 \"My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me;\n \n We hear His voice in our spirits and we follow Him Jo. The natural man cannot hear His voice so these spiritual issues are a mystery to you. That is what I have been telling you for going on two years now. These issues which you find impossible to understand are not impossible for believer who possess Gods Holy Spirit to understand. The fact that you can't see or appreciate that truth, makes it no less true.\n \n \n This is simply because the Bible is not logically consistent, and it's theology is that of the living God, not of the regimented, delineated law. Like a bridge that if you look close enough is mostly empty space, the God's word as a whole is what carries the weight of faith.\n\n \n Regarding the bolded again, that is true from the natural minds perspective. But once the Holy Spirit is guiding us, the word of God comes to life to us. I wish you could experience the light of that truth that only comes from God Himself. Jo, you can't even relate to the concept of having a personal relationship with God. You have serious spiritual needs which must be realized in this lifetime. \n \n You consider me an enemy when I'm one of very few people on this forum who tells you the eternal truth. Just consider what I have said to you in response to your post and ask yourself how well off you are when one of the resident secular humanists, TQ, raises a beer in agreement with what you said. If I were you, and I sincerely cared about knowing Gods truth, that kind of endorsement would scare the life out of me. \n \n Remember Jo, this passage is meant to correct you here and now, not condemn you later. That will only happen if you die not really knowing the Lord nor having possession of His Holy Spirit within you.\n \n 21\"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. 22Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?' 23Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!'\n As a last question Jo, does it sound reasonable to you that if I took your council and refused to share the Lord and His truths here as you recommend, that I would be acting within His will based on everything Jesus and His Apostles taught us in the bible? Now ask yourself who it is that you are serving as you refuse to defend God and side with atheists and secular humanists against me in every debate? I can confidently assure you that it isn't the God of salvation or the Lord Jesus Christ.",

You reject the possibility that one could prove a new interpretation of the observable evidence which are theoretical in and of themselves, and get it either published or taken seriously by a scientific community which is committed to this version which Hubble imagined back in the 20s in spite of the unanswerable holes which exist with it. If the calculations based on general relativity are not even equipped to support the assumptions surrounding the pre-big bang singularity, then which of us is ignorant to just accept that presumed outcome without evidence?\n \n For example, cosmologists dread the pre big bang singularity because at this point gravity becomes infinite, along with the temperature and density of the universe. As its equations cannot cope with such infinities, general relativity fails to describe what happens at the big bang. You call me ignorant for not blindly ignoring such a problem even though any cosmologist in the know is also disturbed by the unanswerable gaps it leads to. It is and has been my contention that arm chair cosmologists like you and Jo who do ignore these problems are the ignorant sheeple who cling to this theory in spite of the unsupportable conclusions it comes to by filling these gaps with air, or better yet, more unproven theoretical principles.\n \n \n You agree that someone who's lifes work is this field would know all the ins and outs, then follow that up by saying they'd be too stupid to know that it was all maade up.\n\n \n Regarding the bolded, of course I don't agree with that statement. Simply because all that is currently known in no way gives a complete picture of what occurred in reality 10 to 20 billion years ago. That is a statement I have repeated in every response to you that you are obviously too dense to comprehend. \n \n What if a scientific theory could be produced which offered a rational picture of the birth of the universe, but it excluded the big bang event itself, would that, or does such a theory exist that you know of?\n \n \nHow many times do you need to be corrected on this? This is not an \"oops, wrong date\", this is a \"I know that this is wrong, but I'm going to say it because it makes them-thar science people stoopid lookin'\". It's embarassing.\n\n \n Once again you focus on the minutia of my statement rather than the statement I made. I said this: I mean, they don't even know the actual original circumstances/conditions which existed 10 to 20 billion years ago.\n \n The bolded was my point, which is an undeniable fact, yet you focus on the 10 to 20 billion year gap between which it is assumed to have happened.\n \n \n Archie, all your questions were answered multiple times. The reason you can't see that is because Jo is talking over your head.\n\n \n But they were answered with unproven theory piled upon unproven theory which themselves create more new questions than they answer in the final analysis. That is the crux of our disagreement. You accept this truly holy evidence as if it's rational and complete enough to rely on and I don't believe we are anywhere close to even accepting the big bang as a real or true theoretical concept. If the OBSERVATIONS we make could only be interpreted one way, I wouldn't be the skeptic I am today. And remember that I'm not alone in this opinion. Many within the scientific community also struggle with the informational and evidentiary gaps.\n \n \nhttp://www.4forums.com/political/creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution/12280-believing-creation-believe-god-2.html#post342135\n \n Listen you lying SOB. If you want to lie, go right ahead. We're all more than happy to laugh at your attempts to be clever. But don't you dare accuse me of lying.\n\n \n Your link goes to pro-con, not any post I wrote.

   "I already mentioned the hypothesis of the big bang emerging from a previous \"big crunch\",\n\n \n Could you post a link to that post from this thread and the quote where you mentioned the LQC as a solution to my pointing out the problems with the big bang singularity, since its equations cannot cope with such infinities? I don't remember that being mentioned at all.\n \n \n it's nice to see a bit more detailed theory emerging about how that could happen, but it certainly doesn't contradict the concept of the big bang, even if it makes the singularity unnecessary. \n\n \n But it completely redefines it based on a new interpretation of the evidence, which has been my ongoing argument regarding interpretation of available observations. It speaks to a big bounce occurring and inflation taking place, and even considers super-inflation as a possibility which raises more question, rather than the traditional event which was called the big bang by conventional cosmology, which was based on the singularity, which was based on the Planck Density, which You cannot reach. It is forbidden by theory.\n \n At this point they are acknowledging the existence of the expansion, but have shown that the big bang as conventionally defined and argued in favor of throughout this thread by you and TQ never occurred as the traditional theory promotes. Don't you see that is the only point I'm attempting to make here? I'm not submitting LQC as a more rational theory at all since I believe there are volumes of unknown elements, principles and observations to the reality of what actually occurred, and predictions which would have, or could have been present which we are totally unaware of and incapable of discerning at this time. \n \n \n By the sound of it, LQC has the potential to actually tie together pre-existing models and firm up assumptions (one mentioned is the smoothness of pre-inflation space).\n\n \n On the surface this is true. But like all theories, if you read the whole article you can't help but see that it raises new question which must be answered before it can be accepted as a relevant theory. After all, the LQC was derived from computer simulations which can only make calculations based on the programmed information it is given as shown here.Singh and Pawlowski developed computer simulations of the universe according to LQC, and that's when they saw the universe bounce. When they ran time backwards, instead of becoming infinitely dense at the big bang, the universe stopped collapsing and reversed direction. The big bang singularity had truly disappeared \n But when they followed this new theory forward new problems arose leading to the collapse of the universe, explained here.When the team used LQC to look at the behaviour of our universe long after expansion began, they were in for a shock - it started to collapse, challenging everything we know about the cosmos. \"This was a complete departure from general relativity,\"\n So they reprogrammed their simulator in order to overcome this problem. The question remains, even though this new calculation works for the simulation, does it in fact reflect actual reality?Early versions of the theory described the evolution of the universe in terms of quanta of area, but a closer look revealed a subtle error. Ashtekar, Singh and Pawlowski corrected this and found that the calculations now involved tiny volumes of space.\n I mean, is it realistic or even rational to define the singular expansion of something as massive as our universe in terms of tiny volumes of space rather than the original quanta of area? And is the need for this new interpretation based on an unknown ingredient in the formula which we don't even know exists because we haven't, or worse yet will never be able to recognize its existence? \n \n What LQC actually represents for cosmologists is a more uniform explanation for the beginning of the universe without having to deal with the unexplainable and unprovable problems which exist with the singularity which I have been arguing against all along in this and other debates. Here's how Kiefer puts it:\n Physicist Claus Kiefer at the University of Cologne in Germany, who has written extensively about the subject, agrees. \"It is really a new perspective on how we can view the early universe,\" he says. \"Now, you have a theory that can give you a natural explanation for a singularity-free universe.\" He adds that while competing theories of quantum gravity, such as string theory, have their own insights to offer cosmology, none of these theories has fully embraced quantum mechanics.\n Note the bolded; now consider the intricacies of quantum gravity, string theory, the depth of quantum mechanics, the unknown variables of quanta of areas as opposed to currently the unknown intricacies of tiny volumes of space, as well as currently unknown triggers for a bounce, and what you have with just these few aspects of this theory, and when you consider the number of orders in which they can be applied, like a cooking recipe the order the ingredients are added, the time it cooks, the temperature it cooks at, and the amount of time it takes to cool all contribute to the final product. \n \n So when we consider the fact that the simulation was specifically looking to effectively reverse engineer what occurred rather than being programmed with absolute known facts, or ingredients; my argument stands that we are no closer to actually knowing what occurred than we were with the traditional version of the big bang which I have shown that the larger community of cosmologists has recognized serious unprovable problems with from the beginning. \n \n At this point I must return to the beginning of this exchange regarding the traditional big bang and ask once again why I was called ignorant, uninformed and clueless regarding the inherent problems with the traditional theory, and why did you defend so fervently something you now seemingly acknowledge has serious and untenable problems for the scientists in the know? And why did you not raise these issues right up front if you are on the cutting edge with your Masters in Theoretical Physics and Mathematics? And are committed not only to defending a theory but discovering what truly occurred between 10 and 20 billion years ago?\n \n Why is the alleged ignorant christian who has no degrees in Physics the only person here who is able to see the flaws in the methodology and assumptions which surround the traditional big bang version of the origin of the universe. I would expect the guy with the degree to point out these problems rather than be condescending as you have fought me and claimed it was me who doesn't understand the intricacies at every turn in this debate. I deserve an apology since I have proven my point regarding numerous problems with interpretation of the known observations, and the unknowns which we are incapable of discerning at this time Jo, but I wont expect it.",

   "You're asking whether it makes sense to describe space as made up of volume rather than area? Would you like to try that one again?\n\n \n Let me ask you this Jo, if what you're asking is so obvious then why did Ashtekar, Singh and Pawlowski first base the program model via the simulation on area rather than volume? And if the calculations are based on different variables by applying the known observations in a different way, can you say for sure that the reverse wouldn't work out better under those circumstances?

Let me ask you this Jo, if the details of your theory can't hold up to the scrutiny of a layman, then of what value is the theory and how can you call that a strawman argument?\n \n \nYes the model is improved and developed over time, and yes that means that some details of the theory will turn out to be incorrect and need remodelling. The Big Bang itself, which is simply a shorthand for saying the universe was an awful lot smaller in the past than it is today, can be considered fact. \n\n \n The LQC isn't an improvement over your version of the big bang Jo, it is a completely unique and new concept which completely eliminates the very singularity that you were defending 2 days ago as a requirement for the big bang. You were saying it was my ignorance which prevented me from understanding what was so obvious to you since you have a masters degree and learned from the people who formulated that theory. \n \n Yet from an in depth response which I give you, you literally quote only 3 sentences and respond to them. And knowing you that means that those 3 sentences represent the only thought I posted which you could find to disagree with. And I had to correct you there also. \n \n \nNow I know that you don't trust ANY science, and it is technically impossible to prove any aspect of science, \n\n \n This statement is wrong on both counts. I trust all kinds of science. Provable, supportable, repeatable science which strangely enough is what the arm chair scientists here ignorantly claim cosmology and evolution represents when that isn't true at all. And there are many aspects of science which are proven in absolute terms based on our technological capabilities at the time. That we continue to delve deeper into confirmed knowledge doesn't negate or nullify what we previously understood. \n \n That isn't what happens with evo or cosmology though. We must completely rewrite chapters based on different interpretations which eventually also get replaced by different interpretations again, and so on and so on. The original facts never remain true because they were wrong and based on false interpretations of faulty evidence in the first place. That's because although Evolution and Cosmology observe real scientific principles sure enough, but their ability to interpret them correctly and place them in the proper order is seriously flawed. That's because we are so far removed from the events these sciences are dealing with or in the case of evo, we attempt to attribute more age than the evidence deserves. But either way the evidence is misinterpreted.

A conglomeration of basic principles don't make a theory true or even rational, for that matter. If Marconi dreamed of sending radio waves through the air for 3 life times, but never happened onto electromagnetic waves and how to correctly utilize them, we wouldn't have radio, microwaves, cordless phones, remote controlled toys, television broadcasts, and more products and technologies that we take for granted today. \n \n So having an acceptable level of evidence for the basic principles of a theory means nothing if you can't properly apply it toward a working model. And my whole contention is that we don't have enough basic principles in order to claim a working model which confirms the big bang event ever occurred at this point in time. And based on what you say above, you'll have to agree with me if you hope to maintain a semblance of credibility as an honest and truth seeking scientist.",

But I haven't been debating this issue with Jo or TQ using the bible as a source at all. I have debated this issue by using scientific sources that showed that what they have been defending is not just blindly accepted by experts in the field. I have shown flaws, errors and misinterpretations of predictions and observations strictly by using sources they can't refute as wrong or inadequate for the arguments I am forwarding. \n \n Only you are attempting to inject the bible into this discussion which is a waste of time engaging in since nobody on your side of the debate appreciates or respects the spiritual perspective it offers regarding either ours, or the Universes origin. So I have not attempted to reason with anyone on that basis or level. In other words, you are derailing the thread and attempting to put it on me because of beliefs I hold, but haven't relied on for this debate at all. My siggy gives a verse regarding the origin of the universe though. Check it out. emoticon_xangel",

   "I don't know about Jo, but I'm still here. Still laughing my XXX off at you. Keep it up!\n\n \n Interesting, cuz you weren't laughing when you ran away from the debate. This post specifically.\n FFS Archie, don't you think if someone devoted their life's work to studying the big bang theory, one of them might go \"Whoa, wait a sec here. Something's not right\", and win the bloody Nobel for it?\n\n Once again you expose the simplicity of your thought processes for all to see. You reject the possibility that one could prove a new interpretation of the observable evidence which are all theoretical in and of themselves, and get it either published or taken seriously by a scientific community which is committed to this version which Hubble imagined back in the 20s, in spite of the unanswerable holes which exist with it. If the calculations based on general relativity are not even equipped to support the assumptions surrounding the pre-big bang singularity, then which of us is ignorant to just accept that presumed outcome without evidence?\n \n For example, cosmologists dread the pre big bang singularity because at this point gravity becomes infinite, along with the temperature and density of the universe. As its equations cannot cope with such infinities, general relativity fails to describe what happens at the big bang. You call me ignorant for not blindly ignoring such a problem even though any cosmologist in the know is also disturbed by the unanswerable gaps it leads to. It is and has been my contention that arm chair cosmologists like you and Jo who do ignore these problems are the ignorant sheeple who cling to this theory in spite of the unsupportable conclusions it comes to by filling these gaps with air, or better yet, more unproven theoretical principles.\n \n \n You agree that someone who's lifes work is this field would know all the ins and outs, then follow that up by saying they'd be too stupid to know that it was all maade up.\n\n \n Regarding the bolded, of course I don't agree with that statement. Simply because all that is currently known in no way gives a complete picture of what occurred in reality 10 to 20 billion years ago. That is a statement I have repeated in every response to you that you are obviously too dense to comprehend. \n \n What if a scientific theory could be produced which offered a rational picture of the birth of the universe, but it excluded the big bang singularity event itself, would that impact your thinking, or does such a theory exist that you know of?\n \n \nHow many times do you need to be corrected on this? This is not an \"oops, wrong date\", this is a \"I know that this is wrong, but I'm going to say it because it makes them-thar science people stoopid lookin'\". It's embarassing.\n\n \n Once again you focus on the minutia of my statement rather than the statement I made. I said this: I mean, they don't even know the actual original circumstances/conditions which existed 10 to 20 billion years ago.\n \n The bolded was my point, which is an undeniable fact, yet you focus on the 10 to 20 billion year gap between which it is assumed to have happened.\n \n \n Archie, all your questions were answered multiple times. The reason you can't see that is because Jo is talking over your head.\n\n \n But they were answered with unproven theory piled upon unproven theory which themselves create more new questions than they answer in the final analysis. That is the crux of our disagreement. You accept this truly holy evidence as if it's rational and complete enough to rely on and I don't believe we are anywhere close to even accepting the big bang as a real or true theoretical concept. If the OBSERVATIONS we make could only be interpreted one way, I wouldn't be the skeptic I am today. And remember that I'm not alone in this opinion. Many within the scientific community also struggle with the informational and evidentiary gaps.\n \n \nhttp://www.4forums.com/political/creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution/12280-believing-creation-believe-god-2.html#post342135\n \n Listen you lying SOB. If you want to lie, go right ahead. We're all more than happy to laugh at your attempts to be clever. But don't you dare accuse me of lying.\n\n \n Your link goes to pro-con, not any post I wrote.
