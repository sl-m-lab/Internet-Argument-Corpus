   "From The Cincinnati Enquirer:\n \n \nCOLUMBUS - Gays, bisexuals and anyone who's undergone a sex change would be banned from adopting or raising foster children under a bill introduced this week and backed by two Southwest Ohio legislators.\n \n House Bill 515, introduced Thursday, bars any adoptive or foster child from being placed in the private residence \"of a homosexual, bisexual, or transgender person.\"\n \n Florida is the only state with such a ban.\n \n The U.S. Census counts more than 3,600 homes headed by unmarried couples of the same sex in Greater Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky, including Kelly and Teresa Robinson, a lesbian couple from Anderson Township. The Robinsons have three daughters and two foster children.\n \n \"What are they thinking?\" Teresa, 43, said just before getting their oldest daughter, Eryn, 10, ready for a dance Friday night at Sherwood Elementary School. \"There are no studies whatsoever saying that a child benefits greater being in a gay home or a straight home.\n \n \"It's like having someone put a KKK cross in your front yard. In someone's opinion, you're not right. The crazy thing is they're the ones that have the hatred in their heart. They're they ones that have the fear in their heart. I'm just raising kids and paying taxes.\"\n \n Nine Ohio legislators who are among the most conservative Republicans in the General Assembly signed on as co-sponsors of state Rep. Ron Hood's bill, including Tom Brinkman of Mount Lookout and Danny Bubp of West Union.\n \n Bubp, Brinkman and Hood, an Ashville Republican, did not return calls.\n \n Barry Sheets, government affairs director for Citizens for Community Values, a non-profit group that promotes Christian moral values, cheered the bill.\n \n \"He's trying to keep the best interest of children and their placement in mind,\" Sheets said. \"The state's responsibility is to be guardians of these wards. ... (Hood) wants to make sure that the state is taking very great care in looking at what's in the best interest of the child first and foremost, and letting all other considerations become secondary. I think that's a very positive direction to take our public policy in relation to children.\"\n \n There are reams of research, according to Sheets, showing \"the best place for a child to be raised is in a stable two-parent home, particularly biologically ... that has both a mother and a father, a husband and a wife.\"\n \n ...[more]\n\n \n I cannot believe that these people walk around proud of the way they wield their positions in society. :xbanghead :xcensored emoticon_confused",

   "I always wondered about lumping everyone in together...\n \n I can understand lumping gay men and lesbians into the same boat since they are both homosexuals, and maybe I can understand lumping in bisexuals since they might want homosexual relationships, but transsexuals?\n \n To me, that's an entirely different beast ( I mean differently abled person ). \n \n There have been homosexuals and bisexuals, I suppose, since the dawn of humanity, but transsexuals have only been around as long as there have been medical procedures capable of altering the appearance and hormones of a man or a woman to make them look more like the opposite sex.\n \n I would also think that the psychology is totally different. \n \n So why would gay men and lesbians (or bisexuals) include transsexuals in the mix?",
