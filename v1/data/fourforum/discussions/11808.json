The President of the US has a remarkably stressful job. He'd probably get a heart attack and die. Maybe it's Palin and Biden we need to focus on?\n\n Both good points. also we know next to nothing about Obama's medical record - he's running basically on a doctor's note that you'd get in grade school. We do know that he smoked al lthe way up until he entered the race, so lung cancer is a very strong possibility, as well as other smoking related problems.\n \n But I think if anything happens to Obama it will be from a racist that doesn't want a black dude calling the shots.\n \n Now, of course, if that happens with Obama as president, we get his fellow nutcase Biden, and we'll quickly be marching off to war in Africa (Sudan, etc.). \n \n And let's not mention the Patriot Act came largely from Biden's proposed patriot act prototype that got shot down when he proposed it way back after the OK City bombings. In fact he quite bragged that it was basically wht he proposed back when it was first proposed after 9/11.",

She is attractive because she doesn't seem like just another lying cheating politician, however when one looks at what Palin believes, most intelligent Americans should be mortified. Luckily, she is running for VP, and not the President.",
