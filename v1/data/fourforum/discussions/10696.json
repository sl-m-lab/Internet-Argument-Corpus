   "All of this talk of primaries, caucuses, conventions, and nominations has got me thinking that it is ridiculous that a relatively small number of voters actually decide the two candidates that are actually legitimate candidates. If we had three parties, there will be a larger say for the the average voter because there would be three decisions to pick from, instead of two that agree on many issues and pander to the \"middle\" or \"moderates.\" All that means is that, apparently a politician has to lie to get anywhere, but with a third legitimate candidate, they (the politicians) at least have to be consistent in their BS.",
