   "One more time.........\n\n \n So you're ignorant then. Fine. You also seem to be not too quick, so I'll explaing this to you slowly.\n \n Article 2, section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States reads as follows:\n \n Clause 2: He shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur; and he shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law: but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.\n \n All that is required from the Senate is consent. There is not one single solitary word saying how this consent will be obtained. That's for the senate to decide. The Constitution gives the Senate free reign to decide how they will figure it out, and for the past 150 years the fillibuster has been part of the process. And just to clarify another point you seem confused about, legislation mean laws. No one is asking the senate to pass a law here, they're asking for consent on judicial nominees.\n \n Now, your not knowing this is simply indicative of your general lack of knowledge. Let us ask though, where did you get this idea to begin with? The answer, of course, is from Sen. Frist. He's been touting his \"Constitutional Option\" for months now. Now, I have to believe that even if Frist doesn't know he constitution, someone who works for him does. He absolutely knows, and there can be no doubt about this, that the constitution does not say that the Senate must give \"an up or down vote\". He knows that's not true, but he keeps saying that. There's a word for saying something you know isn't true with the intent to decieve; lying. VOR is simply parroting the conservative line, Sen. Frist is a liar. There was a time when conservatives wouldn't stand for a public official who lied. Apparently that time is just when it's a Democrat in office. So much for the conservatives being the \"party of values\". Party of covienient values is more like it.",
