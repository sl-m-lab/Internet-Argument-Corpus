   "Well, now I'm beginning to believe that Yuschenko is no different from Milosevic who was put to trial for crimes against his own people. And what about such tough oil pricing policy of our President? It also can turn out to be a crime against our ordinary people, because it results in non-reversible collapse of our vital service-producing industries that leads to cut of heating systems in our houses in the deep of winter and to famine. And all this happens for money and power. It is clear on the eve of elections Yuschenko wants to convince Ukrainians that he has only external enemies and his power works for the goods of ordinary people. Simply it is the readiest way to escape time-urgent punishment for his crimes. But soon, when we face a problem of mass migration of Ukrainians abroad, our President will have to come to earth. Only it'll be late, because this trouble will become world community problem.",
