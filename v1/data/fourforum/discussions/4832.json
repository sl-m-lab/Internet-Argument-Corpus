   "I`m going to post an old thread I started in a nother forum. The discussion the thread generated there was very interesting (allthough it went of tangent on numerous occasions). Here goes:\n \n Is the world facing a future with an aging population? If it is, what is the cause of this problem, what are the consequences of the problem, and what could/should be done about it?\n \n Ever since the 1980:ies various politicians, labour experts, sociologists, population experts and interests groups have been concerned with the emerging problem of lower birth rates and longer life expectancy rates. But the aging population phenomenon is not new. The world population have been aging since the turn of century. In 1950 the elderly (65+) constituted 5,2% of the world population, in the year 2000 the elderly constituted 6,9% of world population. The United Nations have predicted that in the year of 2030, the elderly will constitute 19,3% of the world population. Now, while this problem is a worlwide concern, it affects certain countries and areas more than others:\n \n 1950 2000 2050\n World 5,2% 6,9% 19,3% \n Japan 4,9% 7,2% 36,4%\n Europe: 8,2% 14,7% 29,2%\n China: 4,5% 6,9% 22,7%\n USA: 8,3% 12,3% 21,1%\n \n Source [I seem to have lost the link, but I think I got the numbers from WHO or something. If anyone feel the need for confirmation, I`ll look them up]\n \n As we can see from these figure, the elderly as a percentage of the population is predicted to be highest in japan, closely followed by Europe (allthough, some individual european countries will have figures even closer to Japans). China is predicted to have an even greater percentage of elderly than the US (which kind of surprised me). \n \n The implications of an aging population structure is that fewer and fewer will have to \"pay\" for more and more. Medical costs and the costs for the helthcare of the elderly will naturally increase relative to the output of the working population and so will public and private retirement programs. In some areas of the world, labour shortage may also come out of this development. On the postive side, this development also means that elderly will be more healthy and could contribute to the production longer.\n \n The reason for this aging population is as said before, lower fertility rates and higher life expectancies rates. Higher life expectancy rates are easily explained by better and more effective health care. Diseases, illneses and injuries that where lethal just a decade ago can today be cured, remedied or fixed. The reason for dropping lower fertility reates are less obvious, and highly contested. \n \n One theory is that intergenerational imbalances caused by massive wellfare programs aimed at supporting elderly have caused a decline in fertility rates. Large pension rates, high taxes and small economic support for families with children takes away the incentives to produce children. And re-distibution from poor young to elderly rich also increases the problems caused by an aging population.\n \n Another theory is that liberalisation of women have created a situation where no family member is prepared to pay the economic cost for having a child. Increased avaliability, social acceptance and governmental financial support of abortions and contraceptives (sp?) is also guilty of lowering the fertility rate.\n \n A third theory is that lower fertility rates are a consequence of shifting social and cultural values. The career, wealth and individual achievments are valued more and more while family life, security and the joy of bringing children into this world is valued less. \n \n But it is safe to say that we are far from certain why the fertility rate is dropping in the industrialised world.\n \n What should be done to parry the negative effects of an aging population, and what could be done to reverse the trend?\n \n First of all, the retirement programs needs to be reformed. Instead of using income distribution from present workers to present retirees, retirment programs can be aimed at using income distribution from past workers to present retirees. This can be done by investing a portion of the workers earnings into retirement funds that are invested in the national or international economy. A retiree would then be able to live on the accumulated capital (with interest) that he/she has payed into the fund. Some exeptions must however be made so that everyone can survive on their pensions.\n \n Secondly, the healthcare systems could be reformed. Instead of prolonging the lives of elderly people who are doomed to spend the rest of their life in sick beds or in highly de-humanised states (such as dementia), healthcare can be withheld (or re-directed). Instead of creating quantitive life for the elderly, healthcare could be aimed at creating qualitative life.\n \n Thirdly, as the elderly population also become more vital and healthy, the age of retirement could be raised. This serves two purposes. It lowers the costs of retirement programs as well as increase the production.\n \n But these measures merely parries the negative effects of an aging population and does nothing to remedy the situation. There are a numbers of measure that couls be taken to fix the situation:\n \n First of all the industrialised world could lessen their aging process by allowing more immigrants. The effects are two-fold. First it increases the numbers of workers relative to old people, but it also raises the fertility rate as immigrants tends to have higher fertility rates than western europeans, japanese and americans.\n \n Secondly, wellfare programs could be re-directed to benefit families with children. By increasing economic incentives to create children, the fertility rate could be increased.\n \n Thirdly, by encouraging further equalisation between genders, men can be socially and culturally more accetping to share the responsibility of bringing up children.\n \n Phew... There you have it. Please discuss ;) I`ll ad some more later (country-specific characteristics on the phenomenon as well as a rivaling theory to an aging population)\n \n A third theory is that fertility rates are a cyclic. That is, fertility rates shrink and grow in a cyclic manner. The implications of this theory would be huge on the problem that an aging population poses. Not necessarily better, but certainly different challenges awaits if the aging population is a cyclic trend that relative soon will turn into a \"young-ering\" population.",

   "the aging population is not a problem in itself, it is the artificial timepoint in which they are eligible for benefit. if the age of benefit continues to shift up, or set to a certain fix percentage of the population, then the cost could be contained.\n\n \n Hmmm... I find the suggestion that one should fix the retirement age as a percentage of the population rather interesting. Perhaps with sufficiant weights and flexibility it could be a rather good fix. \n \n \nthe other problem with the aging population is available labor. but as an aging population is usually associated with greater socio-economic-techno development, this may no longer be a significant problem with robotics (who also won't need retirement benefit)\n\n \n As always with robots, Japan is on the forefront of this development. They have recently come up with \"caring\" robots that are designed to provide care and physical closeness and touch to elderly. It may sound like sci-fi, but I think robots ewill play an increasingly important role in the future. Hopwever, there is also the problem with increasing numbers of elderly with demandning problems (like dementia)\n \n \nfinally, the size of the overall population must also be considered.\n\n \n How do you mean?\n \n \nregarding to gender i don't see equalization as a problem\n\n \n To be honest, I regard it more as a sollution.",

   "Increase the baby making?\n \n Won't that increase the total population?\n \n Better watch out for those 'The world is over populated' threads then.\n \n \n \n Can't we just euthanise the elderly?\n \n There's already a blue print for the Renewal thingy in a sci-fi movie where old people just aren't kosher. Except, they renew (with associated laser show) at 30. Maybe we should double that and renew them at 60. About the time they start losing it and getting all useless.\n Or, we could hook them up to a giant machine computer thing and use the old as batteries.\n And when they die, we could use them as fertalizer (or fodder) for food for the next generation...or, depending on the condition of their bodies, as an alternate fuel source.\n \n If you don't like an arbitrary number like 60, we could simply test them. Say, every year at your birth day, we have a major leaguer toss a base ball at your head. If you can catch it, you can live another year. Miss and well...you probably won't be having a next birth day. Oh, and they have to recite the alphabet backwards while catching the ball (that tests them mentally).\n Of course, if someone is willing to pay for you to continue living, keep you on a leash and well cared for, I'm fine with that. I just very tired of all the old people roaming about. Often behind the wheel of a car...killing little children with their limited reflexes and poor dexterity.",
