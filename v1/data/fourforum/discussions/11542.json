   "I'm currently taking a college course on European History, and the many exploits of the Catholic Church came up in yesterday's lecture. The Catholic church of the middle ages sounds much like the conservative party of today.\n \n \n In the middle ages, the peasants would rely on the ministers and higher ranks to interpret the bible.

They had lost most of their power when people started reading for themselves that \"Love thy neighbor\" and \"thou shalt not kill\" are God's word.\n \n Luckily, his popularity prevented him from being burned at the stake.

So, one asks himself, \"What would Jesus do?\". Well, Jesus would probably be in Africa helping the poor starving children, not attending abortion rallies and harassing pregnant women, or voting to deny Gays civil rights.\n \n The reason? Its easier. If modern day Christians were really men of God, they would not be standing around voting conservatively. They would be helping people, which is what Jesus really taught. The fact is, its easier to harass pregnant women and shout so loudly about how wrong abortion is. It requires nearly nothing from them, unlike feeding and clothing the poor. That's apparently too much time and money. Who would want to do that, when in their minds they can be just as Christian making women and gay's lives harder instead of making starving children's lives easier?\n \n \n \n This leads me to the Catholic priests who sold indulgences. Modern day conservative born again Christians are more concerned with profiting emotionally and financially from Conservative Christianity than they are to actually doing God's work and giving back to the world.\n \n If Jesus was alive today, he would be a hippie. Plain and simple, more concerned with helping people and giving to the poor than becoming outraged at homosexuality and the supposed \"murder\" of embryos. In the bible, Jesus's primary idea's were \"love they neighbor\", \"give to the poor\", and \"forgive sinners\". He spends very few passages on how bad homosexuality is, and none on how embryos are humans.\n \n If these conservatives were really men of God, they would be doing the things that Jesus found most important. They conveniently overlook Jesus's main passages because it is simply easier. They can call themselves \"Christians\" and not have to get their hands too dirty. It's quite selfish.",

And, of course, he translated it from St. Jerome's translation, i.e., the Vulgate.\n \nThey had lost most of their power when people started reading for themselves that \"Love thy neighbor\" and \"thou shalt not kill\" are God's word.\nAnd how did they learn to read for themselves? If you can't read at all, translating from Latin to your language won't help much. And why do you think that the English clergy failed to tell their congregations that they should love their neighbor and that the shouldn't kill? You really can't be serious!\n \nLuckily, his popularity prevented him from being burned at the stake.\nPlease inform us. Was that ever actually an option? I do realize that christians do and have almost always had a penchant for killing anyone with whom they disagree. \"Thou shalt not kill\" applies only to those who hold your particular view of christianity. Where would we be today without the religious wars that went on for years in Europe.\n \nIn any case, today's religious bunch are so focused on issues like abortion and gay rights that they conveniently overlook the tens even hundreds of thousands of starving children in Africa, and widespread poverty in our country and in the world.\nBut that is a spin-off from the belief that this is a christian nation, founded on christian principles. Fundamentalist christians actually believe that they have the right to impose their religion on everyone if they are the majority. They don't really seem to understand or really care about the principles of the Constitution.\n \nSo, one asks himself, \"What would Jesus do?\". Well, Jesus would probably be in Africa helping the poor starving children, not attending abortion rallies and harassing pregnant women, or voting to deny Gays civil rights.\nIf there was a Jesus, that would probably be true. But helping children in Africa doesn't contribute anything to the goals of the christian right in this country. That's why they don't care. They care about teaching their religion as science, requiring their pregnant daughters to bear unwanted children, and then they object to government support of those children. They, of course, violently object to homosexuals, not because they have ever cared enough to actually become acquainted with anyone who was a homosexual, but rather because bronze age, nomadic herdsmen objected to homosexuality. How pathetic.\n \nThe reason? Its easier. If modern day Christians were really men of God, they would not be standing around voting conservatively.\nYou're preaching to the choir here.\n \n They would be helping people, which is what Jesus really taught.\nThat's true. But even Bush's first \"faith based\" program to help the needy was found to require a profession of faith before they helped. They took government money and then required the needy to profess belief in their particular cult before they could eat. And our President doesn't see a problem with that. The \"Faith Based Initiative\" is just another means to impose fundamentalist christianity on everyone. The problem is, the program aims at the most vulnerable - \"tell us you believe and you can eat.\"\n \nThe fact is, its easier to harass pregnant women and shout so loudly about how wrong abortion is. It requires nearly nothing from them, unlike feeding and clothing the poor. That's apparently too much time and money. Who would want to do that, when in their minds they can be just as Christian making women and gay's lives harder instead of making starving children's lives easier?\nAgain, you're preaching to the choir.\n \nThis leads me to the Catholic priests who sold indulgences.\nIt was, indeed, nothing more than a means to enrich the church. But it also happened hundreds of years ago. The same mentality exists today, but not in the Catholic church. Take Oral Roberts for example. God talks to him and tells him that he is dead unless he can raise ridiculous amounts of money. The ignorant actually contributed the money. Thus, Oral Roberts is still with us. \n \n And, of course, there are those most moral individuals such as Jimmy Swaggart, Jim Bakker, Kent Hovind and others. That doesn't even address the fundamentalist christian politicians who have been disgraced.\n \nModern day conservative born again Christians are more concerned with profiting emotionally and financially from Conservative Christianity than they are to actually doing God's work and giving back to the world.\nAgain, preaching to the choir here.\n \nIf Jesus was alive today, he would be a hippie. Plain and simple, more concerned with helping people and giving to the poor than becoming outraged at homosexuality and the supposed \"murder\" of embryos.\nSo tell me about a 30+ male who surrounded himself with 12 other males. If you saw that today, what would you think?\n \nIn the bible, Jesus's primary idea's were \"love they neighbor\", \"give to the poor\", and \"forgive sinners\". He spends very few passages on how bad homosexuality is, and none on how embryos are humans.\nAnd christians quote the new testament while enforcing the old testament.\n \nIf these conservatives were really men of God, they would be doing the things that Jesus found most important. They conveniently overlook Jesus's main passages because it is simply easier. They can call themselves \"Christians\" and not have to get their hands too dirty. It's quite selfish.\nI couldn't agree more.",

   "The translation of the Bible into English was not just about people being able to read it, but to hear it being read and listen to it. It was not uncommon for Lollards to begin reading from Wycliffe's translation during Mass, talking over the priest from the congregation. The amount of understanding ordinary people had of Christianity in the mediaeval period was low, the priest really was the source of all their knowledge about Christianity. The idea of the Bible being at the centre of Christianity is very much a protestant idea, for most of Christian history the church has decided what is right and wrong, using Christ's commission of Peter as justification.",

   "Unfortunately, the answer to your question is yes, no, and there is no way to know. \n \n Conservative christians who focus on issues that result in political advancement rather than compassion and love are serving God because they believe in their heart that the effort they extend will help expand God's kingdom. They are totally convinced and confident that what they are doing is the will of God, and this very unwavering faith is what God requires to please him. \n \n Then again, as you correctly pointed out, their actions, while of noble intentions, are contrary to what Jesus would focus on. Intentions to do good is not going to get you to heaven if you're actually doing wrong. And Jesus would surely minister to the needy rather than cater to the agendas of those with power-motivated agendas. \n \n Then again, there is really no way to correctly answer your question. What God requires as service to him is often ambiguous and contradictory. There are at least a million different ways to serve God the right way, yet all agree that only one way is the right way, which makes the other 999,999 ways wrong. And the one right way happens to be the one followed by the person you're talking to.",
