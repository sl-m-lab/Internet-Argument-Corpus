   "Some things never change..\n \n \n source \n \n Sunday, June 27, 2004\n \n LIES OF FAHRENHEIT 9/11 -- EXPOSED\n Outright lies\n \n 1) Riots during Bush's inauguration led him to cancel his plans to walk the last leg of his parade route.\n Bush did, in fact, walk the last leg of his parade. Here's a picture.\n \n 2) The Saudis, with a $860 billion investment in American firms, own 7% of America.\n Not surprisingly, AMERICANS own the vast majority of America. The total value of all domestic assets held by American households and non-profit organizations in Q1 2004 is $55 trillion. \n \n The Saudis would be a drop in the bucket even if they DID have $860 billion here, but they don't. The total value of foreign investments in the US in 2002, the latest year statistics are available, was $8.58 trillion. \n \n Here's the breakdown of that money, by percentage of the $8.58 trillion -- NOT by percentage of all of America.\n UK - 21.0%\n France - 12.7%\n The Netherlands - 11.5%\n Japan - 11.3%\n Germany - 10.2%\n Switzerland - 8.4%\n Canada - 6.8%\n Luxembourg - 2.5%\n Everyone else with less than 2.5% each- 15.6%\n \n That means Saudi Arabia has less than $215 billion here, if you do the math, which makes sense since the entire GDP of Saudi Arabia is only $286 billion. Seven percent is total ********. \n \n 3) The US gave Bin Laden a 2-month head start before sending special forces after him.\n Yeah, right, like Moore knows exactly where our special forces troops are all the time. Besides, if we really wanted to make sure we didn't let any Al Qaeda troops escape, we'd have to send huge numbers of troops to Afghanistan immediately after Sept. 11 along with invading Pakistan in the process, which I'm sure Moore wouldn't be too happy about either. And where would those huge numbers of troops come from? Probably from places like Moore's hometown of Flint, Michigan, where Moore is so distraught about the military being the most attractive occupation. More on this later. \n \n 4) Bush cut soldiers' pay by 33%.\n Bush may be dopey, but he's not stupid enough to slash the pay of the people he counts on most. Soldiers not only get their regular salaries, but also get added bonuses for things like housing, combat duty, deployment, etc. The Bush administration looked at trimming these bonuses back to their pre-war levels in an effort to save money. Soldiers protested, so the raised bonuses were extended until the end of FY2004 with the approval of both Bush and Congress.\n \n 5) Iraq under Saddam never threatened or harmed any Americans.\n Consider the following:\n -Fugitive terrorist Abdul Rahman Yasin, who mixed the explosives for the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, fled to Iraq shortly after his indictment and stayed there for several years.\n -Fugitive terrorist Abu Nidal was funded by Saddam and sheltered in Baghdad for years before Saddam changed his mind and expelled him in 1983 in an effort to please us. Abu Nidal was responsible for a wide variety of international terrorist attacks. \n -Fugitive terrorist Abu Abbas, responsible for the 1985 hijacking of the Achilles Lauro cruise liner in which a disabled American Jew was shot dead and thrown overboard, was sheltered in Baghdad until 2003 when invading American troops captured him. \n -Fugitive terrorist (notice a pattern here?) Abu Musab al-Zarqawi fled to Iraq from Afghanistan with two dozen Al-Qaeda terrorists in May 2002 and stayed to organize terror plots. He is now directing insurgent operations against American troops.\n -Iraqis held American (and non-American) hostages for months following its invasion of Kuwait in 1990, threatening to use them as human shields. \n -Iraqi intelligence agents were caught trying to kill former President Bush during a visit to Kuwait in 1993. In response, Bill Clinton ordered a cruise missile strike on Iraqi intelligence headquarters, killing nine civilians in the process. Where was Michael Moore then?\n -The Iraqi military for years shot at US and British aircraft enforcing no-fly zones.\n No, really. Saddam loved us. \n \n Half-Truths\n \n 1) Bush spent the summer of 2001 fishing and golfing.\n He fished and golfed, but read here for the non-play stuff he did too.\n \n 2) The war in Afghanistan was meant to complete a natural gas pipeline project, led by Unocal and Bush's family, connecting the Caspian Sea with Pakistan. They even went so far as to invite the Taliban to Texas.\n The pipeline project mentioned in the film did exist, and chauvinist Taliban representatives did meet with Unocal at their headquarters in Texas. However, Unocal was merely one competitor in this project. The Argentinian energy firm Bridas was also in the running. Moreover, when the deal was finally signed in May 2002, neither company would be involved. \n \n 3) Only one of Congress' 535 members has a child serving in Iraq. \n This is technically correct -- Senator Tim Johnson's son serves with the 101st Airborne. However, Senator Joseph Biden's son is in the Delaware National Guard, and -- ironically enough -- Attorney General John Ashcroft's son Andy is deployed in the Persian Gulf with the Navy. \n \n 4) Afghanistan's army is the US Army.\n There are mostly US troops in Afghanistan, but there is a NATO force there comprised primarily of German and Canadian troops, as well as many other NATO countries. Moreover, the US Army is training the Afghan army, which already has over 7,000 troops. The Afghan army is helping to enforce security for the elections coming up there this fall, which never would've happened if Moore were in charge.\n \n Oh, the Irony!\n \n 1) In late 2002, Michael Moore stated at a debate that he thought Bin Laden should be considered innocent until proven guilty -- therefore our invasion of Afghanistan was totally unjustified. Judging from his criticism that we sent too few troops into Afghanistan too late, he's apparently changed his mind about this.\n \n 2) Moore criticizes Bush for finishing his reading of a children's book once he heard the World Trade Center was under attack. What was he supposed to do? Cancel the event in the middle and storm out of the room ready to invade Afghanistan? Wouldn't that be spreading the \"aura of fear\" that Moore criticized Bush for creating? Wouldn't that have made Moore even more suspicious about Bush supposedly knowing the attack was coming? Wouldn't it have been better for Bush to just finish the stupid little book about the goat, politely say goodbye to the kids, and then get to work on the crisis (which is what he did)? \n \n 3) Richard Clarke, Bush's former chief of counterterrorism, is one of Moore's heroes in the movie, talking about various intelligence failures and such. For example, Moore dwells on the fact that about two dozen members of Bin Laden's family were allowed to leave America shortly after 9/11. However, what Moore leaves out is that Richard Clarke himself claims he approved those flights, with the approval of the FBI, who had actually been spying on all of them for several years anyway and apparently decided they were not of any interest. \n \n 4) Why doesn't Michael Moore donate all his profits from his films and speeches to charities that help wounded soldiers, if he's so concerned about them?\n \n 5) Moore's pretty leftist -- but the long-suppressed leftists in Iraq and Afghanistan are quite in favor of our interventions there.\n \n 6) James Bath was investigated for fraud committed when he was a director of the Bank of Credit and Commerce (BCCI). This investigation was conducted by a Senate team led by John Kerry.\n \n 7) Moore portrays American soldiers as bloodthirsty killers who like to napalm baby girls and then \"watch the mother****ers burn.\" Unless, of course, they're from Moore's hometown of Flint, Michigan, in which case they're simply innocent victims of poverty. \n \n What Moore Didn't Tell You\n \n 1) Donald Rumsfeld met with Saddam Hussein.\n This happened in late 1983, when Rumsfeld was chosen by the Reagan administration as an envoy to the Middle East. Rumsfeld had previously served in the Nixon and Ford administrations, and at the time was CEO of multinational pharmaceutical company GD Searle (now part of Pfizer), so he would not be an unusual choice as an envoy. \n \n Showing this clip in the film gives the viewer the impression that Rumsfeld was a member of some secret cabal of Americans who built up Saddam into a war machine. Rumsfeld was sent for a number of reasons. At the time, Iran and Iraq were in a serious war, and America feared Iran much more than it feared Iraq. Iran had kidnapped American hostages, and Iranian-backed militiamen had blown up the US Embassy and Marine barracks in Beirut, so Saddam was simply the least evil person to talk to. This is why we decided to look the other way when Saddam gassed Iran. Moreover, while the US did provide intelligence to Iraq, most of Iraq's actual military equipment came from France and Russia, so it is unfair to blame exclusively the US for militarizing Saddam. Those aren't American-made AK-47s they're shooting at us.\n \n 2) Bin Laden family ties with the Bush family, James Bath, and the Carlyle Group\n Moore shows how one of Osama Bin Laden's brothers was involved in investments with a guy named James Bath, and then goes on to explain that, because everyone in the Bin Laden family is related, they must know where Bin Laden is and might be harboring him. \n You have to remember that Osama Bin Laden has 53 siblings, born to 20 different mothers. Just because you're Osama Bin Laden's brother doesn't mean you know where he is, or even that you like him or have ever spent much time with him. In fact, in their family, each wife had a different house, and since Osama doesn't have any siblings by his own mother, he didn't get to know many of his siblings. \n \n Moreover, the Bin Ladens are a wealthy and powerful family in Saudi Arabia, having made its fortune in the construction industry. The Bushes are a wealthy and powerful family in America, having made its fortune in oil. Osama aside, it's not unexpected that these families might have some business contacts. \n \n If Bush really lives in the pockets of the Bin Ladens, and if the Bin Ladens love their brother so much, why have they allowed the US to pursue this \"War on Terror?\" Consider the following:\n -The Saudis were against the destruction of the Taliban. \n -The Saudis forced the US military to move its Mideast military headquarters to Qatar.\n -The Saudis have a Shiite minority, unlike Iraq, whose Shiite majority was oppressed by Saddams Sunni minority. Now that Iraq's Shiites have been emboldened, Saudi Arabia has a new threat to its stability.\n -Iraq's oil industry has been jumpstarted, creating a potential competitor for the Saudi oil companies. \n -Violence in Saudi Arabia is reaching new highs, with foreign workers being kidnapped and whole neighborhoods being stormed and assaulted. \n -The Saudi government's image worldwide has been tarnished -- even in the Middle East itself -- as both Americans and Al Qaeda call for its destruction.\n \n Most telling of all, Saudi Arabia is NOT a member of the \"Coalition of the Willing.\" Why would this be if the Bush and Saud families were really so incestuous?\n \n 3) The Saudis gave Bush $1.4 billion. \n Listen carefully and you'll hear Moore say \"$1.4 billion to BUSH.... and his friends and associates and their companies.\" Since Bush has a bunch of rich friends working for a lot of different companies, investing $1.4 billion in all of their employers combined probably isn't as scary as it sounds. \n \n 4) New Afghan President Hamid Karzai was an advisor to Unocal.\n This is true; Karzai spent 1996-97 advising Unocal on the pipeline mentioned in the movie. However, Moore's portrayal of Karzai as an oilman and a puppet isn't entirely true -- Karzai did have a life outside of Unocal. He spent the 1980s fighting against the Soviets. He is the chief of a Pashtun tribe in Afghanistan, and is a relative of the deposed king. Former Taliban leader Mullah Omar once asked him to represent Afghanistan at the UN, but relations between Karzai and the Taliban soured as Karzai almost died in a mission with US Special Forces to infiltrate Taliban territory and form a resistance movement against them. Karzai was elected president by a council of Afghan leaders. Certainly, he's a man with more leadership potential than many... more than Moore, for sure. \n \n 5) Moore shows two minutes of footage of how peaceful, happy, and utopian life in Iraq was before the evil Americans came in and messed everything up. \n This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen in my life. He shows kids flying kites and people sipping on tea in caf\u00e9s, then cuts to scenes of the US bombing Baghdad. What he doesn't tell you is that the building shown blowing up right afterwards is the Iraqi Ministry of Defense, where I assure you no kids were flying kites. There were probably mass genocides planned and directed in many of those buildings before we blew them to pieces. Besides, plenty of people are sipping on tea in caf\u00e9s right now in Iraq, who hated Saddam, who hate us, and who are probably laughing that Moore is making movies like this. What's his point?\n \n Since Moore closes his film with an Orwell quote, so will I.\n \n \"The quickest way of ending a war is to lose it.\"\n George Orwell\n Polemic, May 1946\n \"Second Thoughts on James Burnham\"\n \n This is what Moore would like more than anything else, since he hates America and thinks Americans are \"stupid pricks.\" What was the point of this film? He draws no conclusions -- instead, he puts out a bunch of carefully cut-and-pasted images and quotes and hopes you end up hating Bush, much like how Bush throws out \"Al-Qaeda,\" \"9/11\", \"Saddam,\" and \"WMD\" and hopes you put them all together. \n \n I am sick of seeing this hypocritical con man worshipped like a demigod.

Anytime one can target 50% of a market, such as the subject film, and antagonize a good portion of the remaining 50% into spending their money out of curiosity, financial success is assured. \n \n Incidentally, the current financial value of any foreign country to the US is not their fixed capital investment but their purchase of our treasury issues, all that keeps our leaky old boat afloat.

Controversy sells (also seen in the Passion). \n \n Also, I heard something interesting about Michael Moore that I wonder if anyone else has heard. Supposedly, when Michael Moore had so touched the judges at the Cannes Film Festival, Martin Scorsese told him that he would vote for the first time in his life due to the film. In response, Michael Moore said that he would be voting for the first time as well. If this is true, he is the biggest political hypocrite one can be; those who don't vote in presidential elections cannot complain about the president or the state of affairs brought about by their campaign. Especially since he rants for the 1st quarter of the movie on how Bush \"stole\" the election. \n \n Michael Moore is also contesting that there is no connection between the title of his film \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" and Ray Bradbury's work \"Fahrenheit 451\" in order to justify not contacting Bradbury beforehand. The title is part of the draw of the movie, since it imitates Bradbury's recognizable work, so paying the author for the rights to it would not be out of the question. It's like naming a store Honey B Hams in order to draw Honey Baked Hams customers and not acknowledging that there is such a store.\n \n The movie was worth about a dollar, maybe $1.50.",

   "You can disagree with the message but you can't disagree with the facts. That said, Moore isn't in it for the money. I live on the other side of Flint than from where he grew up, and I know people who have known him his whole life. He's genuinely trying to do his best to help humanity. He has no other agenda, and any money he's making is probably just to keep putting information out for the public. \n \n Also, there is more you can do to help decide an election than vote. He campaigns for people, which possibly influences people more than his one vote could. He campaigned for Nader in 2000 (funny thing, Jeb Bush invited him to campaign in Florida, then got mad when he told people to vote for Gore instead because it was a battleground state), and he backed Wes Clark this time around. He also released a film this year that may have a an influence on the election. Personally I already know of one person who has never voted before and is going to vote after seeing the film. One man can go a lot further than one vote.",

   "What facts.. You mean that Mr. Moore is doing it \"for the people\" like you say from the comfort of his multi million dollar penthouse in NY? (he only keeps the FLint, MI home so he can pretend to be working class). Do you really believe that \"any money he's making is probably just to keep putting information out for the public.\"? I do not understand why you are so starry-eyed about this guy...\n \n \n Here chew on this...\n \n \n \"In F911 Michael Moore asserts that the Bush family is inexorably tied to both the bin Laden family and the Saudi monarchy through their mutual association with the Carlyle Group. Well, my friends, guess who else is linked to the Carlyle Group? None other than Michael Moore himself! \n \n \n Not content with lambasting the Bush administration, Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 is now poised to bite the very hand that feeds it - albeit inadvertently. \n One of Moore's prime targets is the Carlyle Group, a Washington DC-based investment firm that allegedly links the Bush and Bin Laden families. The trouble is that the company recently became co-owner of the very cinema chain due to screen Fahrenheit 9/11 across America. \n \n On its US release this Friday, Moore's film will play on 59 screens of the Loews cinema chain. But Variety reports that the chain is now part-owned by the Carlyle Group, a defence contractor that Moore derides as a war profiteer with extensive ties with the Bin Ladens and the Saudi royal family. The first president Bush worked as a highly paid adviser to the company, while James Baker - chief of staff under Ronald Reagan - is currently employed as a senior counsellor.\n So, in other words, every time someone pays to see F911 in a Lowes theater you are putting money into the pockets of the Carlyle Group, and if Moore is to be believed, that money will eventually make its way into the pockets of the Bush family, the bin Laden family, and the Saudi monarchy. \n Moore goes to great pains in F911 to draw all sorts of conspiratorial conclusions from business associations between the various parties mentioned in the film. Odd that he hasn't disclosed his own connection to the very people he's accusing, isn't it? \n \n Update: Since you Moore-ons don't seem to be able to grasp the point of this post, let me spell it out for you. Obviously there are no real connections between Moore and the Carlyle Group. But this is exactly the type of paper-thin conspiratorial ******** upon which he has based the entire premise of F911. So, if you buy Moore's arguments then you should also buy this \"connection\" as well. \n \n Ask yourself, how is Bush cozy with the bin Laden family? What evidence does Moore offer in support of that contention? And is it any less a sex-degrees-of-separation relationthip than the one tying Moore financially to the Carlyle Group? \"\n \n \n \n Outright Lies",

   "Michael Moore is a man bent on making money through controversy. He has the money to make a film about his point of view and that film will give him great returns. I have not seen the movie and don't want to. He's just another in a long list of people I try to ignore. Freedom of speech is his podium, the movie-going public his congregation. That's all, nothing more.\n I doubt that he really wanted to expose the truth about anyone - that takes hard work, planning and many, many sleepless nights.

Money is money regardless how you make it.\n \n I'd rather watch a movie with Madonna in the leading role to be honest...and that'll never happen.\n\n \n As a fellow Michigander, I find Moore repulsive.

   "A question for all you fahrenheit 9/11 fans: What would you have had President Bush do in those first few minutes after the WTC attacks? Everyone is quick to fault him for sitting there and finishing what he was there to do. Do you want him to have jumped up and ran out causing a panic amongst everyone in the nation when it would be shown LIVE on TV? Those children were never at risk by him being there.

The Secret Service would not have allowed anything to happen there. \n Secondly, people complain about the President \"hiding\" at barksdale AFB immediately afterwards. The President does not have a say in where he goes in situations like that. The Secret Service TELLS him what to do for his protection. He is not allowed to overrule them. They are charged with his safety and can take him where they feel is the safest place. Also, do you think he was ever out of touch with Washington?

He is always just one room away from the President, 24 hours a day. He could have called for a strike from there. \n \n The outright lies and ignorance feigned or not of Michael Moore is just astounding.

   "A question for all you fahrenheit 9/11 fans: What would you have had President Bush do in those first few minutes after the WTC attacks? Everyone is quick to fault him for sitting there and finishing what he was there to do. Do you want him to have jumped up and ran out causing a panic amongst everyone in the nation when it would be shown LIVE on TV? Those children were never at risk by him being there. Thinking that is just absurd. What danger were those kids in? while the President was there those were the best protected kids in the world. The Secret Service would not have allowed anything to happen there. \n Secondly, people complain about the President \"hiding\" at barksdale AFB immediately afterwards. The President does not have a say in where he goes in situations like that. The Secret Service TELLS him what to do for his protection. He is not allowed to overrule them. They are charged with his safety and can take him where they feel is the safest place. Also, do you think he was ever out of touch with Washington? He has the best equipped mobile communications center in Air force One. He has instantanious worldwide satallite and computer communication as well as voice and data stream. He is never out of touch with what is going on. If it was a nuclear attack the officer carrying the \"football\", the briefcase with the nuclear codes was never out reach from him. He is always just one room away from the President, 24 hours a day. He could have called for a strike from there. \n \n The outright lies and ignorance feigned or not of Michael Moore is just astounding. The fact that people will believe what ever Michael Moore tells them to believe is even more astounding to me.\n \n And yes I saw the movie and laughed throughout the whole thing. A great work of fiction.\n\n \n Liberals don't think rationally. They'd rather criticize Bush for continuing to sit in the school room and taking no immediate action after the news came to him than to criticize Clinton for doing nothing about the perp Bin Laden for years before 9/11.\n \n Besides that, they probably don't fathom the \"football\" and the role of the Secret Service in a crisis period.\n \n I disagree with only your last statement. It is a not a great work of fiction...it is a work of great fiction.",

   "I saw the film and thought it was well done as a piece of political propaganda, although I don't agree with its message. With that said, Michael Moore is still a hypocrite and a profiteer. He didn't make this movie to make people realize the truth, he made it so that he could make money. Controversy sells (also seen in the Passion). \n \n Also, I heard something interesting about Michael Moore that I wonder if anyone else has heard. Supposedly, when Michael Moore had so touched the judges at the Cannes Film Festival, Martin Scorsese told him that he would vote for the first time in his life due to the film. In response, Michael Moore said that he would be voting for the first time as well. If this is true, he is the biggest political hypocrite one can be; those who don't vote in presidential elections cannot complain about the president or the state of affairs brought about by their campaign. Especially since he rants for the 1st quarter of the movie on how Bush \"stole\" the election. \n \n Michael Moore is also contesting that there is no connection between the title of his film \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" and Ray Bradbury's work \"Fahrenheit 451\" in order to justify not contacting Bradbury beforehand. The title is part of the draw of the movie, since it imitates Bradbury's recognizable work, so paying the author for the rights to it would not be out of the question. It's like naming a store Honey B Hams in order to draw Honey Baked Hams customers and not acknowledging that there is such a store.\n \n The movie was worth about a dollar, maybe $1.50.\n\n \n Hi, I didn't see anyone reply to this from the first page. I might have missed it. I have to disagree with you about not voting and complaining. In 2000, I did not vote in the presidential race, but I feel I have every right to complain. The two viable choices were Al Gore and George Bush, Jr. and I think it's safe to say that voting for Nader or anyone lower is throwing your vote away, like not voting at all. \n \n If you think both of your only two choices suck equally, then you have the right not to vote. Also, no matter which sucky candidate wins, you have the right to complain about the sucky job he's doing or why you disagree with his sucky policies (not that there's really anything you can do about it). If Al Gore were president we'd most likely be complaining about him right now and we'd be perfectly entitled to do so whether we voted or not.",

The good thing about America on this issue is that you sold arms to everyone - Iran and Iraq, the USA is an equal opportunity war-monger.\n \n \n This is one point I agree with Hellhound. Same with the Soviet Union - when they switched to capitalism there was initially a lot of hardship and some support for the return to communism. However Hellhound has, like that other government spokesman here (Broker) failed to acknowledge that Saddam was in power because of US help.

(a time when the Iraq army was poisoning the Kurds and on the Iranians).\n \n \"The U.S. restored formal relations with Iraq in November 1984, but the U.S. had begun, several years earlier, to provide it with intelligence and military support (in secret and contrary to this country's official neutrality) in accordance with policy directives from President Ronald Reagan. These were prepared pursuant to his March 1982 National Security Study Memorandum (NSSM 4-82) asking for a review of U.S. policy toward the Middle East.\"\n http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB82/\n \n \"On August 18, 2002, the New York Times carried a front-page story headlined, \"Officers say U.S. aided Iraq despite the use of gas\". Quoting anonymous US \"senior military officers\", the NYT \"revealed\" that in the 1980s, the administration of US President Ronald Reagan covertly provided \"critical battle planning assistance at a time when American intelligence knew that Iraqi commanders would employ chemical weapons in waging the decisive battles of the Iran-Iraq war\". The story made a brief splash in the international media, then died.\n \n While the August 18 NYT article added new details about the extent of US military collaboration with Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein during Iraq's 1980-88 war with Iran, it omitted the most outrageous aspect of the scandal: not only did Ronald Reagan's Washington turn a blind-eye to the Hussein regime's repeated use of chemical weapons against Iranian soldiers and Iraq's Kurdish minority, but the US helped Iraq develop its chemical, biological and nuclear weapons programs.\"\n http://www.counterpunch.org/dixon06172004.html\n \n There's a bunch of articles\n \"The West May Go On Trial with Saddam\"\n http://www.independent-media.tv/item.cfm?fmedia_id=7821&fcategory_desc=History%20of%20US%20Military%20Involvement\n \n \"Saddam Will Miss Old Buddy Reagan\"\n http://www.independent-media.tv/item.cfm?fmedia_id=7722&fcategory_desc=History%20of%20US%20Military%20Involvement\n \n \"How America armed Iraq\"\n http://www.independent-media.tv/item.cfm?fmedia_id=7707&fcategory_desc=History%20of%20US%20Military%20Involvement\n \n \"Reagan?s WMD Connection to Saddam Hussein\"\n http://www.fff.org/comment/com0406g.asp\n \n I expect Rev Hellhound will seek to provide no counter-evidence.

   " \n ... if you were making a point that some people hate moore personally, i totally agree. however, i thought that this thread was about exposing the lies of moore's film...\n\n \n It took a turn somewhere and added the need to show that Moore is a lying bastard.\n \n Here's another...\n \n http://www.moorelies.com/\n \n Debunking Farenheit 9/11 \n \n by Brittany Craigo\n \n For months, many have anticipated the debut of Michael Moore&#8217;s Farenheit 9/11. What would he say? What would he uncover? What new theory would he attempt to convince the public of, by cutting and pasting strips of footage, as he did in Bowling for Columbine and Roger and Me? I had heard about many of the phony claims and conspiracy theories to occur in Farenheit 9/11. And I knew that sooner or later, I would be forced to debate one of the many automatons who had been indoctrinated by his socialist propaganda. I knew, however, that I couldn&#8217;t critique a movie that I had not seen without being disingenuous. So I strapped on my Bush gear and headed toward the theatre to watch the quasi communist in action. \n \n The movie opens with the 2000 election. I was baffled to hear Moore claim that &#8220;numerous investigations said that Gore won Florida.&#8221; Which numerous investigations were these? The New York Times1, the Washington Post,2 and USA Today,3 reported the same consensus after both recounts: George W. Bush won. I&#8217;m willing to accept the fact that, nationally, Gore won the popular vote. That is accurate. However, we have something called the &#8220;electoral college.&#8221; But to claim that &#8220;numerous investigations said that Gore won Florida&#8221; is preposterous! This is undoubtedly why Moore didn&#8217;t choose to name these &#8220;numerous sources.&#8221; There were none. \n \n Then, in a pure pathetic act, Moore shows footage of CNN calling Florida for Gore, followed by Fox News calling Florida for Bush, and then CNN retracting their previous claim. The theory here was that Gore had won Florida and numerous stations announced it until, lo and behold, Fox News said Bush won Florida and the rest of the news stations &#8220;followed their lead.&#8221; First off, the notion that CNN and the rest of the news stations would all of a sudden change the results to fit those of one station- Fox News- is ridiculous. I highly doubt that Tom Brokaw sat; waiting for what Fox said in order to &#8220;follow their lead.&#8221; If that were the case, I would argue that CNN and all the rest who changed their results, to fit those of Fox News, should be wiped off the face of journalism as we know it. Just imagine it: &#8220;Well... Fox News said Bush won... we better say Bush won too!&#8221; Give me a break. \n \n Why did Fox News call Florida for Bush? They didn&#8217;t. Fox News, along with CNN, ABC, NBC etc. all incorrectly called Florida for Gore more than an hour before polls had closed in several conservative Florida counties.4 After getting wind of the fact that they were all wrong, Fox News and the rest of the stations retracted their statements. But what does Moore do in this movie? The same thing he does in all of his movies. He spliced and diced the footage to make it seem as though Fox News deliberately lied and somehow convinced the rest of the stations to lie too. But there is a much more important fact that Moore unintentionally raises here: By calling Florida for Gore before the polls had closed in these highly Republican counties, residents didn&#8217;t bother to vote, since the election had already been called in Gore&#8217;s favor. According to Democratic strategist Bob Beckel, Bush lost up to 8,000 votes because of the media&#8217;s reporting errors.5 But Moore didn&#8217;t mention this. Instead he mentions that George W. Bush&#8217;s cousin was working for Fox News that night. What he fails to mention, however, is that, as previously noted, Fox News called Florida for Gore as well and by the time Fox had corrected itself and announced Florida for Bush at 2:16 a.m., all polls were already closed and there was no harm to be done. I wonder how Moore missed all those facts.6\n \n After the Florida debacle, Michael Moore introduces us to the &#8216;convoluted&#8217; relationship between the Bush family and the House of Saud. First off, though wouldn&#8217;t consider myself &#8220;politically correct,&#8221; and though I think that the Saudi government is obviously not one of perfection, I found Moore&#8217;s depiction of the Saudis to be unfair. The fact that Michael Moore chose to lump all Saudis and members of the Royal Saudi family into the terrorism category is completely hypocritical. Isn&#8217;t Michael Moore supposed to be the liberal-minded peace-keeper, looking out for minorities and such? His attempt to convince ignorant viewers that the House of Saud is only akin to George Bush is a pure example of his manipulative nature. Needless to say, I was beyond surprised when those surrounding me in the movie theatre shook their heads at every Saudi that flashed upon the screen. Imagine if someone had depicted all blacks as Black Panthers or all Moslems as part of the Taliban! That isn&#8217;t ok. But depicting every Saudi as a terrorist is, simply because they have a relationship with America and, thus, its current president. \n \n Moreover, if Bush &#8220;wakes up in the morning, thinking about what&#8217;s best for the Saudis, rather than thinking about what&#8217;s best for you&#8221; (as Moore claims), why did we invade Iraq? By invading Iraq and securing those oil fields, the Saudis probably stood to lose billions of dollars! Aside from that, the Saudi family members are Sunnis; the thought that we would liberate the Shiites of Iraq plagued them with fear. This is precisely why King Fahd exclaimed, before we went to war, that Saudi Arabia &#8220;rejects outright any infringement on Iraq&#8217;s unity, independence, resources and internal security, as well as a military occupation&#8221;7 Michael Moore, however, presumes that maybe Bush &#8220;told Prince Bandhar not to worry because he already had a plan&#8221; (meaning Iraq). Yes, &#8220;don&#8217;t worry Prince Bandhar. We&#8217;ll soon be taking billions of dollars away from your family and liberating your archenemy!&#8221; I&#8217;m sure that made the prince feel wonderful. Moore obviously lacks common sense on this issue, or at least hopes his audience does. \n \n In addition, Moore&#8217;s overexerted attempt to paint the Bush-Bin Laden connection as anything spectacular is ridiculous. As the movie notes, the Bush family was connected to the Bin Ladens, (who claim to have disowned Osama), through the Carlyle Group. But the Carlyle group is a highly connected D.C. firm that specializes in aerospace and defense investments, so good luck finding any government official who isn&#8217;t tied to the Bin Ladens. Even George Soros, who is probably the most anti-Bush figure in America right now, has 100,000,000 dollars invested in the Carlyle Group; Bill Clinton is affiliated with the Carlyle Group, along with his former Secretary of State, Madeline Albright8 and, according to John Hardman, &#8220;Jimmy Carter met with 10 of Osama Bin Laden&#8217;s brothers early in 2000 on a fund-raising trip for the Carter Center in Atlanta.&#8221; If you ask me, George Bush needs a few more Saudi friends in order to keep up with the Democrats! \n \n The Bush-Bin Laden &#8220;connection&#8221; all comes into play as we &#8220;learn&#8221; that the White House allowed the Bin Laden family to fly out of America after the attacks. I can&#8217;t blame Michael Moore for this mistake because there have been many new revelations since he began making his film. In fact, in an interview with The Hill, Richard Clark, the ex terrorism czar who recently wrote a book denouncing the Bush administration, admitted that it was his own sole decision to allow the Bin Ladens to fly out of the country. He stated that, &#8220;I take responsibility for it. I don&#8217;t think it was a mistake, and I&#8217;d do it again.&#8221;9 While Moore was most likely unaware of this fact at the time he was making his movie, he was dishonest in implying that the Bin Ladens&#8217; departure from the U.S. was on September 11th, while all other planes were grounded. In fact, the Bin Ladens departed in the days following September 11th, when the grounding for commercial flights had already been lifted. \n \n Moore also accuses Bush of &#8220;taking too many vacations.&#8221; We&#8217;ve all heard this before. He cites a Washington Post article, claiming that during the first eight months in office, Bush was on &#8220;vacation&#8221; 42% of the time. I decided to do a little research on that article and- surprise surprise- found his claims to be a bit, shall we say, &#8220;off.&#8221; It was actually the first year and eight months in office and included trips to foreign nations to discuss foreign policy. According to that Washington Post article, most of that time was spent in Camp David.10 Perhaps this is why one of the photos we see of Bush &#8220;vacationing&#8221; at Camp David, is a picture of George W. Bush and none other than Tony Blair- the Prime Minister of England. And while Moore attempts to leave the audience with the impression that Camp David is a place for lounging and drinking beer, Wikipedia Encyclopedia states that it &#8220;[is] often used for formal and informal discussion between the United States and world leaders,&#8221; and cites many historical negotiations that have taken place there.11 \n \n Moore finally takes his biggest cheap shot at President Bush; chastising him for continuing to calmly read to students in Florida (for seven minutes) after just having been informed that the World Trade Center had been attacked. I couldn&#8217;t help but giggle at this one. You know that leftists have got their panties in a twist, when they resort to this in order to criticize the president. I suppose Moore expected Bush to live up to his &#8220;cowboy status&#8221; by pulling a Glock out of a holster and yelling, &#8220;BRING &#8216;EM ON!&#8221; On the contrary, Bush acted in a complete professional manner. Anyone could clearly see from the expression on his face, that he was in complete shock and distress, though he remained calm. In fact, the teacher who was in the room, at the time, recently came rushing to Bush&#8217;s defense, explaining that his calming effect had, &#8220;helped us get through a very difficult day.&#8221; She admitted that she had not voted for Bush, but said, &#8220;That day I would have voted for him.&#8221;12 Ouch. \n \n Moore then begins to talk about the infamous memo that the White House received before September 11th, entitled, &#8220;Bin Laden Wants to Attack America.&#8221; Aside from the fact that we&#8217;ve known Bin Laden wanted to attack America since 1993, Moore forgets that the memo shed no light as to when or where the attack would take place. After all, fourteen out of the seventeen sentences in that PDB were historical in nature. But perhaps Bush purposely ignored the memo, knowing full-well what was about to happen. As Moore wonders, &#8220;Maybe the war in Afghanistan was really about something else.&#8221; He notes that &#8220;In 1997 while George W. Bush was Governor of Texas, a delegation of Taliban leaders from Afghanistan flew to Houston to meet with Unocal executives to discuss the building of a pipeline through Afghanistan, bringing natural gas from the Caspian Sea.&#8221; When I first heard this, I thought I had surely missed something. But then I remembered who had directed the garbage I was watching, and began thinking logically once again. What did Governor Bush have to do with the discussion to build a pipeline in Afghanistan? That pipeline was sought out under the Clinton Administration. Yes, Bush happened to be governor of Texas at the time, but that&#8217;s completely irrelevant to the meetings which occurred between Unocal and the Taliban at Bill Clinton&#8217;s concession!13 But Moore plays with words; purposely including irrelevant information regarding Bush, to connect him with the topic at hand. Moreover, when the pipeline deal was actually implemented in 2002, Unocal released a press release, stating that, &#8220;Unocal has no plans or interest in becoming involved in any projects in Afghanistan.&#8221;14 \n \n If I were to present an award to the slimiest element in Farenheit, it would have to go to Moore&#8217;s depiction of Saddam Hussein and his regime before the invasion of Iraq. Oh it was a wonderful place. We see children flying kites, a woman getting married and Saddam holding a child. I can&#8217;t even express the outrage that causes me, having known someone whose family was slaughtered by Saddam Hussein&#8217;s henchmen during the invasion of Kuwait. This crossed the boundary between an anti-Bush documentary and a new form of Leni Riefenstahl-like propaganda. The way Moore portrayed Saddam Hussein was exactly the way that she portrayed Adolf Hitler, in order to gain support for the Nazi agenda. By claiming that Saddam Hussein &#8220;never took the life of any American or threatened any American,&#8221; Moore fails to acknowledge the 148 American soldiers killed (in combat) by Saddam Hussein&#8217;s regime during the Gulf War,16 his attacks on American planes patrolling no-fly zones for a consecutive ten years after the Gulf War15 and his attempt to assassinate George H.W. Bush; but I guess military personnel and Republican presidents don&#8217;t count. And of course, it wouldn&#8217;t be a Michael Moore film without the footage of those evil, brutal American soldiers of ours. Not one of them is cast in a good light. Instead, we are shown only what Michael Moore wants us to see- insensitive hicks, just looking for a thrill and a few soldiers who are vehemently opposed to the war. There are no heroes; few patriots- only Moore&#8217;s presentation of how he views Americans. He also fails to mention that the structure we see being so ferociously destroyed by American explosives was Saddam&#8217;s Iraqi Ministry of Defense.17 Needless to say, he furthers the idea that the U.S. military is reckless, heartless, and brainless. \n \n Then, of course, we&#8217;re subjected to the baseless rhetoric about the PATRIOT Act. I found it interesting that while Michael Moore decides to &#8220;read&#8221; the Act to the senators from his ice cream truck (in order to point out its many over-looked &#8220;flaws&#8221;), the audience never hears it. We don&#8217;t even hear a snippet of the PATRIOT Act&#8217;s abuse of civil liberties. Why? Because Michael Moore knows quite well that if we were to hear or read the PATRIOT Act for ourselves, we would realize how necessary and, in fact, over-due it was. For anyone who is unfamiliar with the PATRIOT Act, it represented a huge breakthrough in the way our intelligence shares information. Sec. 203 finally allowed law enforcement to share information with intelligence agencies. This is crucial to our national defense and, indeed, imperative, if we wish to prevent another 9/11. Despite the fact that there have been no documented Civil Rights abuses under the PATRIOT Act, Moore rounds up a few paranoid cooks that insist they were targeted by the FBI, for being against the war. In reality, the PATRIOT Act allows the same search and seizure methods that are already allotted for local crime. Search warrants and &#8220;reasonable cause&#8221; are still mandatory under the PATRIOT Act.18 \n \n Moore then pulls a stunt which had the audience in tears. He spoke with Representative Porter Goss, who was defending the PATRIOT ACT. Gross informs Moore that problems with the PATRIOT Act can be reported by calling a toll-free &#8220;800 number.&#8221; We then see words flashed across the screen, informing the audience that there is no &#8220;800 number,&#8221; but that Goss does have a private telephone line, as he flashes their (202) office number across the screen. Once again, while Moore won a few laughs, he was lying through his teeth. The U.S. House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (where problems with the PATRIOT act can be reported) does have a toll-free number, though its prefix is (877). The number is 1-877-858-9040.19 Somebody ought to tell Moore, so he doesn&#8217;t have to go through the trouble of yelling it over a loud-speaker in an ice cream truck again. \n \n Of course it wouldn&#8217;t be a Michael Moore film without him doing what he&#8217;s famous for- heckling unsuspecting people and making them look crazy for not taking him seriously. He approaches some Congressmen, in order to get them to &#8220;sign their kids up for the army.&#8221; It was just asinine. How does a parent sign their child up for the army? His rationale for doing so is that &#8220;only one congressman has a son or daughter enlisted in the armed forces.&#8221; FLAT-OUT-LIE. According to Kelly Beaucar, who wrote a Fox News article, entitled, Handful of Congressman Send Their Kids to War, &#8220;There are at least seven members of Congress with children in the Armed Forces.&#8221; In fact, there are eight: Tim Johnson(D), Marilyn Musgrave(R), Ed Schrock(R), Joe Wilson(R), John Kline(R), Duncan Hunter(R), Todd Akin(R)20, and Joe Biden(D)21 are all Congressmen who have children currently serving in the military, not to mention the 36 veterans in congress22. And Moore would probably disheartened to know that his favorite punching bag, John Ashcroft, also had a son serving in the military.23 \n \n Moore seems to have a knack for ignoring relevant information. Upon discussing the Coalition of the Willing, he only mentions the small countries that don&#8217;t possess troops, while leaving out the countries which do, such as Poland, England and Australia.24 And of course we&#8217;re supposed to be disgusted that our armed forces possess large quantities of low-income earners and minorities, and that recruiters often go to the more unfortunate towns, looking for people to enlist. Think about that argument. Leftists like Moore are upset when a company doesn&#8217;t hire enough minorities and upset when the military hires too many! Only someone as ungrateful as Michael Moore, could be appalled at the fact that low-income earners from places like Flint, MI are &#8220;targeted&#8221; by the military and granted the greatest opportunities that America has to offer- education, money, benefits, housing, training, food and heroism. But, of course, Moore sees none of these things. He is still too blinded by his hatred for the United States and his belief that the U.S. military is the embodiment of shame. \n \n Michael Moore ends Farenheit 9/11 with a quote from George Orwell. I, myself, have a quote from George Orwell that Moore just may have overlooked. \n &#8220;If you hamper the war effort of one side, you automatically help out that of the other. Nor is there any real way of remaining outside such a war as the present one. In practice, he that is not with me is against me.&#8221;25 I couldn&#8217;t have said it better myself. \n \n Some links below may require registering to online newspaper.\n \n 1: http://www.nytimes.com\n 2 :http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com\n 3: http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2001-04-03-floridamain.htm \n 4: http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/lott200312100915.asp \n 5: http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/lott200312100915.asp \n 6: http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/11/14/politics/main249357.shtml \n 7: http://www.kentucky.com/mld/kentucky/5421527.htm \n 8: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlyle_Group\n 9: http://www.hillnews.com/news/052604/clarke.aspx \n 10: http://www.washingtonpost.com\n 11: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_David \n 12: http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2004/6/24/102357.shtml \n 13: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/2016340.stm \n 14: http://www.unocal.com/uclnews/98news/centgas.htm \n 15: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War#Casualties \n 16: http://premium.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0211/18/sdi.06.html \n 17: http://www.nypost.com/postopinion/and http://slate.msn.com/id/2102723 \n 18: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_PATRIOT_Act \n 19: http://intelligence.house.gov/ \n 20: http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,82469,00.html \n 21: http://www.washingtontimes.com\n 22: http://grunt.space.swri.edu/senatevet.htm \n 23: http://www.washingtontimes.com/functions\n 24: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003\n 25: http://www.george-orwell.org/l_quotes.html\n \n http://www.larryelder.com/911/debunking911.html",

   "http://www.9-11commission.gov/hearings/hearing12/staff_statement_15.pdf\n this is a bit lengthy so i printed it out, ill get back to it later\n\n ok, now that i got a chance to read this, i can comment on it. in fact, jim i must thank you for linking this report, which is actually an official national commission on terrorist attacks report of the al qaeda organization. this is probably the most substantial of all the links you have provided, as it is not just a journalist article but the genuine government source, compiled by commission based on actually intelligence facts, not newspaper opinions. i really appreciated this\n \n the article mentions Iraq in 2 sections, and I'll paste in the paragraphs so you can get the context in which it mentions the Iraq involvement with the al qaeda (page 3)\n \n \nWith al Qaeda as its foundation, Bin Laden sought to build a broader Islamic army that also included terrorist groups from Egypt, Lybia, Algeria, Saudi Arabia and Oman, Tunisia, Jordan, Iraq, Lebanon, Morocco, Somalia and Eritrea. Not all groups from these states agreed to join, but at least one from each did. With a multinational council intended to promote common goals, coordinate targeting, and authorize asset sharing for terrorist operations, this Islamic force represented a new level of collaboration among diverse terrorist groups.\n\n \n here, we see that at least one terrorist group from iraq, as well as from about 10 other countries were linked to al qaeda.\n \n the second mention of iraq in the report is this one (page 5)\n \nBin Laden also explored possible cooperation with Iraq during his time in Sudan, despite his opposition to Hussein's secular regime. Bin Laden had in fact at one time sponsored anti-Saddam Islamists in Iraqi Kurdistan. The Sudanese, to protect their own ties with Iraq, reportedly persuaded Bin Laden to cease support and arranged for contacts between Iraq and al Qaeda. A senior Iraqi intellegence officer reportedly made three visits to Sudan, finally meeting with Bin Laden in 1994. Bin Laden is said to have requested space to establish training camps, as well as assistance in procuring weapons, but Iraq apparently never responded. There have been reports that contacts between Iraq and al Qaeda also occurred after Bin Laden had returned to Afghanistan, but they do not appear to have resulted in a collaborative relationship. Two senior Bin Laden associates have adamantly denied that any ties existed between al Qaeda and Iraq. We have no credible evidence that Iraq and al Qaeda cooperated on attacks against the United States.\n\n as we can see, the reports populating the media that iraqi senior officials having meetings with al qaeda were true. what the media does not tell you is that at the meetings iraq turned down al qaeda's offer to collab. isnt that something... by all standards this deception that the media promotes gives the false public impression of iraq and al qaeda working together. obviously nobody looks at this, but everybody is quick to target moore for his movie, which actually shows more facts than the liberal media does.",

   " ...http://www.moorewatch.com/\n fails to even address the film, totally irrelevant\n ...\n \n ...\n\n \n In your haste, you neglected to read the link thoroughly.\n \n http://www.moorewatch.com/\n \n Maybe you should review the others as well.\n \n *************************************************\n \n Stupid White Movie \n What Michael Moore Misses About the Empire \n \n By ROBERT JENSEN \n \n I have been defending Michael Moore&#8217;s &#8220;Fahrenheit 9/11&#8221; from the criticism in mainstream and conservative circles that the film is leftist propaganda. Nothing could be further from the truth; there is very little left critique in the movie. In fact, it&#8217;s hard to find any coherent critique in the movie at all. \n \n The sad truth is that &#8220;Fahrenheit 9/11&#8221; is a bad movie, but not for the reasons it is being attacked in the dominant culture. It&#8217;s at times a racist movie. And the analysis that underlies the film&#8217;s main political points is either dangerously incomplete or virtually incoherent. \n \n But, most important, it&#8217;s a conservative movie that ends with an endorsement of one of the central lies of the United States, which should warm the hearts of the right-wingers who condemn Moore. And the real problem is that many left/liberal/progressive people are singing the film&#8217;s praises, which should tell us something about the impoverished nature of the left in this country. \n \n I say all this not to pick at small points or harp on minor flaws. These aren&#8217;t minor points of disagreement but fundamental questions of analysis and integrity. But before elaborating on that, I want to talk about what the film does well. \n \n More... \n The good stuff \n \n First, Moore highlights the disenfranchisement of primarily black voters in Florida in the 2000 election, a political scandal that the mainstream commercial news media in the United States has largely ignored. The footage of a joint session of Congress in which Congressional Black Caucus members can&#8217;t get a senator to sign their letter to allow floor debate about the issue (a procedural requirement) is a powerful indictment not only of the Republicans who perpetrated the fraud but the Democratic leadership that refused to challenge it. \n \n Moore also provides a sharp critique of U.S. military recruiting practices, with some amazing footage of recruiters cynically at work scouring low-income areas for targets, whom are disproportionately non-white. The film also effectively takes apart the Bush administration&#8217;s use of fear tactics after 9/11 to drive the public to accept its war policies. \n \n &#8220;Fahrenheit 9/11&#8221; also does a good job of showing war&#8217;s effects on U.S. soldiers; we see soldiers dead and maimed, and we see how contemporary warfare deforms many of them psychologically as well. And the film pays attention to the victims of U.S. wars, showing Iraqis both before the U.S. invasion and after in a way that humanizes them rather than uses them as props. \n \n The problem is that these positive elements don&#8217;t add up to a good film. It&#8217;s a shame that Moore&#8217;s talent and flair for the dramatic aren&#8217;t put in the service of a principled, clear analysis that could potentially be effective at something beyond defeating George W. Bush in 2004. \n \n Subtle racism \n \n How dare I describe as racist a movie that highlights the disenfranchisement of black voters and goes after the way in which military recruiters chase low-income minority youth? My claim is not that Moore is an overt racist, but that the movie unconsciously replicates a more subtle racism, one that we all have to struggle to resist. \n \n First, there is one segment that invokes the worst kind of ugly-American nativism, in which Moore mocks the Bush administration&#8217;s &#8220;coalition of the willing,&#8221; the nations it lined up to support the invasion of Iraq. Aside from Great Britain there was no significant military support from other nations and no real coalition, which Moore is right to point out. But when he lists the countries in the so-called coalition, he uses images that have racist undertones. To depict the Republic of Palau (a small Pacific island nation), Moore chooses an image of stereotypical &#8220;native&#8221; dancers, while a man riding on an animal-drawn cart represents Costa Rica. Pictures of monkeys running are on the screen during a discussion of Morocco&#8217;s apparent offer to send monkeys to clear landmines. To ridicule the Bush propaganda on this issue, Moore uses these images and an exaggerated voice-over in a fashion that says, in essence, &#8220;What kind of coalition is it that has these backward countries?&#8221; Moore might argue that is not his intention, but intention is not the only question; we all are responsible for how we tap into these kinds of stereotypes. \n \n More subtle and important is Moore&#8217;s invocation of a racism in which solidarity between dominant whites and non-white groups domestically can be forged by demonizing the foreign &#8220;enemy,&#8221; which these days has an Arab and South Asian face. For example, in the segment about law-enforcement infiltration of peace groups, the camera pans the almost exclusively white faces (I noticed one Asian man in the scene) in the group Peace Fresno and asks how anyone could imagine these folks could be terrorists. There is no consideration of the fact that Arab and Muslim groups that are equally dedicated to peace have to endure routine harassment and constantly prove that they weren&#8217;t terrorists, precisely because they weren&#8217;t white. \n \n The other example of political repression that &#8220;Fahrenheit 9/11&#8221; offers is the story of Barry Reingold, who was visited by FBI agents after making critical remarks about Bush and the war while working out at a gym in Oakland. Reingold, a white retired phone worker, was not detained or charged with a crime; the agents questioned him and left. This is the poster child for repression? In a country where hundreds of Arab, South Asian and Muslim men were thrown into secret detention after 9/11, this is the case Moore chooses to highlight? The only reference in the film to those detentions post-9/11 is in an interview with a former FBI agent about Saudis who were allowed to leave the United States shortly after 9/11, in which it appears that Moore mentions those detentions only to contrast the kid-gloves treatment that privileged Saudi nationals allegedly received. \n \n When I made this point to a friend, he defended Moore by saying the filmmaker was trying to reach a wide audience that likely is mostly white and probably wanted to use examples that those people could connect with. So, it&#8217;s acceptable to pander to the white audience members and over-dramatize their limited risks while ignoring the actual serious harm done to non-white people? Could not a skilled filmmaker tell the story of the people being seriously persecuted in a way that non-Arab, non-South Asian, non-Muslims could empathize with? \n \n Bad analysis \n \n &#8220;Fahrenheit 9/11&#8221; is strong on tapping into emotions and raising questions about why the United States invaded Afghanistan and Iraq after 9/11, but it is extremely weak on answering those questions in even marginally coherent fashion. To the degree the film has a thesis, it appears to be that the wars were a product of the personal politics of a corrupt Bush dynasty. I agree the Bush dynasty is corrupt, but the analysis the film offers is both internally inconsistent, extremely limited in historical understanding and, hence, misguided. \n \n Is the administration of George W. Bush full of ideological fanatics? Yes. Have its actions since 9/11 been reckless and put the world at risk? Yes. In the course of pursuing those policies, has it enriched fat-cat friends? Yes. \n \n But it is a serious mistake to believe that these wars can be explained by focusing so exclusively on the Bush administration and ignoring clear trends in U.S. foreign and military policy. In short, these wars are not a sharp departure from the past but instead should be seen as an intensification of longstanding policies, affected by the confluence of this particular administration&#8217;s ideology and the opportunities created by the events of 9/11. \n \n Look first at Moore&#8217;s treatment of the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan. He uses a clip of former counterterrorism official Richard Clarke complaining that the Bush administration&#8217;s response to 9/11 in Afghanistan was &#8220;slow and small,&#8221; implying that we should have attacked faster and bigger. The film does nothing to question that assessment, leaving viewers to assume that Moore agrees. Does he think that a bombing campaign that killed at least as many innocent Afghans as Americans who died on 9/11 was justified? Does he think that a military response was appropriate, and simply should have been more intense, which would have guaranteed even more civilian casualties? Does he think that a military strategy, which many experts believe made it difficult to pursue more routine and productive counterterrorism law-enforcement methods, was a smart move? \n \n Moore also suggests that the real motivation of the Bush administration in attacking Afghanistan was to secure a gas pipeline route from the Caspian Basin to the sea. It&#8217;s true that Unocal had sought such a pipeline, and at one point Taliban officials were courted by the United States when it looked as if they could make such a deal happen. Moore points out that Taliban officials traveled to Texas in 1997 when Bush was governor. He fails to point out that all this happened with the Clinton administration at the negotiating table. It is highly unlikely that policymakers would go to war for a single pipeline, but even if that were plausible it is clear that both Democrats and Republicans alike have been mixed up in that particular scheme. \n \n The centerpiece of Moore&#8217;s analysis of U.S. policy in the Middle East is the relationship of the Bush family to the Saudis and the bin Laden family. The film appears to argue that those business interests, primarily through the Carlyle Group, led the administration to favor the Saudis to the point of ignoring potential Saudi complicity in the attacks of 9/11. After laying out the nature of those business dealings, Moore implies that the Bushes are literally on the take. \n \n It is certainly true that the Bush family and its cronies have a relationship with Saudi Arabia that has led officials to overlook Saudi human-rights abuses and the support that many Saudis give to movements such as al Qaeda. That is true of the Bushes, just as it was of the Clinton administration and, in fact, every post-World War II president. Ever since FDR cut a deal with the House of Saud giving U.S. support in exchange for cooperation on the flow of oil and oil profits, U.S. administrations have been playing ball with the Saudis. The relationship is sometimes tense but has continued through ups and downs, with both sides getting at least part of what they need from the other. Concentrating on Bush family business connections ignores that history and encourages viewers to see the problem as specific to Bush. Would a Gore administration have treated the Saudis differently after 9/11? There&#8217;s no reason to think so, and Moore offers no evidence or argument why it would have. \n \n But that&#8217;s only part of the story of U.S. policy in the Middle East, in which the Saudis play a role but are not the only players. The United States cuts deals with other governments in the region that are willing to support the U.S. aim of control over those energy resources. The Saudis are crucial in that system, but not alone. Egypt, Jordan and the other Gulf emirates have played a role, as did Iran under the Shah. As does, crucially, Israel. But there is no mention of Israel in the film. To raise questions about U.S. policy in the Middle East without addressing the role of Israel as a U.S. proxy is, to say the least, a significant omission. It&#8217;s unclear whether Moore actually backs Israeli crimes and U.S. support for them, or simply doesn&#8217;t understand the issue. \n \n And what of the analysis of Iraq? Moore is correct in pointing out that U.S. support for Iraq during the 1980s, when Saddam Hussein&#8217;s war on Iran was looked upon favorably by U.S. policymakers, was a central part of Reagan and Bush I policy up to the Gulf War. And he&#8217;s correct in pointing out that Bush II&#8217;s invasion and occupation have caused great suffering in Iraq. What is missing is the intervening eight years in which the Clinton administration used the harshest economic embargo in modern history and regular bombing to further devastate an already devastated country. He fails to point out that Clinton killed more Iraqis through that policy than either of the Bush presidents. He fails to mention the 1998 Clinton cruise missile attack on Iraq, which was every bit as illegal as the 2003 invasion. \n \n It&#8217;s not difficult to articulate what much of the rest of the world understands about U.S. policy in Iraq and the Middle East: Since the end of WWII, the United States has been the dominant power in the Middle East, constructing a system that tries to keep the Arab states weak and controllable (and, as a result, undemocratic) and undermine any pan-Arab nationalism, and uses allies as platforms and surrogates for U.S. power (such as Israel and Iran under the Shah). The goal is control over (not ownership of, but control over) the strategically crucial energy resources of the region and the profits that flow from them, which in an industrial world that runs on oil is a source of incredible leverage over competitors such as the European Union, Japan and China. \n \n The Iraq invasion, however incompetently planned and executed by the Bush administration, is consistent with that policy. That&#8217;s the most plausible explanation for the war (by this time, we need no longer bother with the long-ago forgotten rationalizations of weapons of mass destruction and the alleged threat Iraq posed to the United States). The war was a gamble on the part of the Bush gang. Many in the foreign-policy establishment, including Bush I stalwarts such as Brent Scowcroft, spoke out publicly against war plans they thought were reckless. Whether Bush&#8217;s gamble, in pure power terms, will pay off or not is yet to be determined. \n \n When the film addresses this question directly, what analysis does Moore offer of the reasons for the Iraq war? A family member of a soldier who died asks, &#8220;for what?&#8221; and Moore cuts to the subject of war profiteering. That segment appropriately highlights the vulture-like nature of businesses that benefit from war. But does Moore really want us to believe that a major war was launched so that Halliburton and other companies could increase its profits for a few years? Yes, war profiteering happens, but it is not the reason nations go to war. This kind of distorted analysis helps keep viewers&#8217; attention focused on the Bush administration, by noting the close ties between Bush officials and these companies, not the routine way in which corporate America makes money off the misnamed Department of Defense, no matter who is in the White House. \n \n All this is summed up when Lila Lipscomb, the mother of a son killed in the war, visits the White House in a final, emotional scene and says that she now has somewhere to put all her pain and anger. This is the message of the film: It&#8217;s all about the Bush administration. If that&#8217;s the case, the obvious conclusion is to get Bush out of the White House so that things can get back to to what? I&#8217;ll return to questions of political strategy at the end, but for now it&#8217;s important to realize how this attempt to construct Bush as pursuing some radically different policy is bad analysis and leads to a misunderstanding of the threat the United States poses to the world. Yes, Moore throws in a couple of jabs at the Democrats in Congress for not stopping the mad rush to war in Iraq, but the focus is always on the singular crimes of George W. Bush and his gang. \n \n A conservative movie \n \n The claim that &#8220;Fahrenheit 9/11&#8221; is a conservative movie may strike some as ludicrous. But the film endorses one of the central lies that Americans tell themselves, that the U.S. military fights for our freedom. This construction of the military as a defensive force obscures the harsh reality that the military is used to project U.S. power around the world to ensure dominance, not to defend anyone&#8217;s freedom, at home or abroad. \n \n Instead of confronting this mythology, Moore ends the film with it. He points out, accurately, the irony that those who benefit the least from the U.S. system&#8212;the chronically poor and members of minority groups&#8212;are the very people who sign up for the military. &#8220;They offer to give up their lives so we can be free,&#8221; Moore says, and all they ask in return is that we not send them in harm&#8217;s way unless it&#8217;s necessary. After the Iraq War, he wonders, &#8220;Will they ever trust us again?&#8221; \n \n It is no doubt true that many who join the military believe they will be fighting for freedom. But we must distinguish between the mythology that many internalize and may truly believe, from the reality of the role of the U.S. military. The film includes some comments by soldiers questioning that very claim, but Moore&#8217;s narration implies that somehow a glorious tradition of U.S. military endeavors to protect freedom has now been sullied by the Iraq War. \n \n The problem is not just that the Iraq War was fundamentally illegal and immoral. The whole rotten project of empire building has been illegal and immoral&#8212;and every bit as much a Democratic as a Republican project. The millions of dead around the world&#8212;in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, Southeast Asia&#8212;as a result of U.S. military actions and proxy wars don&#8217;t care which U.S. party was pulling the strings and pulling the trigger when they were killed. It&#8217;s true that much of the world hates Bush. It&#8217;s also true that much of the world has hated every post-WWII U.S. president. And for good reasons. \n \n It is one thing to express solidarity for people forced into the military by economic conditions. It is quite another to pander to the lies this country tells itself about the military. It is not disrespectful to those who join up to tell the truth. It is our obligation to try to prevent future wars in which people are sent to die not for freedom but for power and profit. It&#8217;s hard to understand how we can do that by repeating the lies of the people who plan, and benefit from, those wars. \n \n Political strategy \n \n The most common defense I have heard from liberals and progressives to these criticisms of &#8220;Fahrenheit 9/11&#8221; is that, whatever its flaws, the movie sparks people to political action. One response is obvious: There is no reason a film can&#8217;t spark people to political action with intelligent and defensible analysis, and without subtle racism. \n \n But beyond that, it&#8217;s not entirely clear the political action that this film will spark goes much beyond voting against Bush. The &#8220;what can I do now?&#8221; link on Moore&#8217;s website suggests four actions, all of which are about turning out the vote. These resources about voting are well organized and helpful. But there are no links to grassroots groups organizing against not only the Bush regime but the American empire more generally. \n \n I agree that Bush should be kicked out of the White House, and if I lived in a swing state I would consider voting Democratic. But I don&#8217;t believe that will be meaningful unless there emerges in the United States a significant anti-empire movement. In other words, if we beat Bush and go back to &#8220;normal,&#8221; we&#8217;re all in trouble. Normal is empire building. Normal is U.S. domination, economic and military, and the suffering that vulnerable people around the world experience as a result. This doesn&#8217;t mean voters can&#8217;t judge one particular empire-building politician more dangerous than another. It doesn&#8217;t mean we shouldn&#8217;t sometimes make strategic choices to vote for one over the other. It simply means we should make such choices with eyes open and no illusions. This seems particularly important when the likely Democratic presidential candidate tries to out-hawk Bush on support for Israel, pledges to continue the occupation of Iraq, and says nothing about reversing the basic trends in foreign policy. \n \n In this sentiment, I am not alone. Ironically, Barry Reingold&#8212;the Oakland man who was visited by the FBI&#8212;is critical of what he sees as the main message of the film. He was quoted in the San Francisco Chronicle saying: &#8220;I think Michael Moore&#8217;s agenda is to get Bush out, but I think it (should be) about more than Bush. I think it&#8217;s about the capitalist system, which is inequitable.&#8221; He went on to critique Bush and Kerry: &#8220;I think both of them are bad. I think Kerry is actually worse because he gives the illusion that he&#8217;s going to do a lot more. Bush has never given that illusion. People know that he&#8217;s a friend of big business.&#8221; \n \n Nothing I have said here is an argument against reaching out to a wider audience and trying to politicize more people. That&#8217;s what I try to do in my own writing and local organizing work, as do countless other activists. The question isn&#8217;t whether to reach out, but with what kind of analysis and arguments. Emotional appeals and humor have their place; the activists I work with use them. The question is, where do such appeals lead people? \n \n It is obvious that &#8220;Fahrenheit 9/11&#8221; taps into many Americans&#8217; fear and/or hatred of Bush and his gang of thugs. Such feelings are understandable, and I share them. But feelings are not analysis, and the film&#8217;s analysis, unfortunately, doesn&#8217;t go much beyond the feeling: It&#8217;s all Bush&#8217;s fault. That may be appealing to people, but it&#8217;s wrong. And it is hard to imagine how a successful anti-empire movement can be built on this film&#8217;s analysis unless it is challenged. Hence, the reason for this essay. \n \n The potential value of Moore&#8217;s film will be realized only if it is discussed and critiqued, honestly. Yes, the film is under attack from the right, for very different reasons than I have raised. But those attacks shouldn&#8217;t stop those who consider themselves left, progressive, liberal, anti-war, anti-empire or just plain ******-off from criticizing the film&#8217;s flaws and limitations. I think my critique of the film is accurate and relevant. Others may disagree. The focus of debate should be on the issues raised, with an eye toward the question of how to build an anti-empire movement. Rallying around the film can too easily lead to rallying around bad analysis. Let&#8217;s instead rally around the struggle for a better world, the struggle to dismantle the American empire. \n \n Robert Jensen is a journalism professor at the University of Texas at Austin and the author of &#8220;Citizens of the Empire: The Struggle to Claim Our Humanity&#8221; from City Lights Books.

   "The movie opens with the 2000 election. I was baffled to hear Moore claim that \"numerous investigations said that Gore won Florida.\" Which numerous investigations were these? The New York Times1, the Washington Post,2 and USA Today,3 reported the same consensus after both recounts: George W. Bush won. I'm willing to accept the fact that, nationally, Gore won the popular vote. That is accurate. However, we have something called the \"electoral college.\" But to claim that \"numerous investigations said that Gore won Florida\" is preposterous! This is undoubtedly why Moore didn't choose to name these \"numerous sources.\" There were none. \n\n and what of the fact that thousands of florida residents that were estimated to vote democrat (felons) were removed from the voter's roster?\n \n \nThen, in a pure pathetic act, Moore shows footage of CNN calling Florida for Gore, followed by Fox News calling Florida for Bush, and then CNN retracting their previous claim. The theory here was that Gore had won Florida and numerous stations announced it until, lo and behold, Fox News said Bush won Florida and the rest of the news stations \"followed their lead.\" First off, the notion that CNN and the rest of the news stations would all of a sudden change the results to fit those of one station- Fox News- is ridiculous. I highly doubt that Tom Brokaw sat; waiting for what Fox said in order to \"follow their lead.\" If that were the case, I would argue that CNN and all the rest who changed their results, to fit those of Fox News, should be wiped off the face of journalism as we know it. Just imagine it: \"Well... Fox News said Bush won... we better say Bush won too!\" Give me a break. \n\n brittany counter's moore's claim with her own judgement, rather than facts...\n \n \nWhy did Fox News call Florida for Bush? They didn't. Fox News, along with CNN, ABC, NBC etc. all incorrectly called Florida for Gore more than an hour before polls had closed in several conservative Florida counties.4 After getting wind of the fact that they were all wrong, Fox News and the rest of the stations retracted their statements. But what does Moore do in this movie? The same thing he does in all of his movies. He spliced and diced the footage to make it seem as though Fox News deliberately lied and somehow convinced the rest of the stations to lie too. But there is a much more important fact that Moore unintentionally raises here: By calling Florida for Gore before the polls had closed in these highly Republican counties, residents didn't bother to vote, since the election had already been called in Gore's favor. According to Democratic strategist Bob Beckel, Bush lost up to 8,000 votes because of the media's reporting errors.5 But Moore didn't mention this. Instead he mentions that George W. Bush's cousin was working for Fox News that night. What he fails to mention, however, is that, as previously noted, Fox News called Florida for Gore as well and by the time Fox had corrected itself and announced Florida for Bush at 2:16 a.m., all polls were already closed and there was no harm to be done. I wonder how Moore missed all those facts.6\n\n moore never said that fox lied. the count shows that bush won, but thats after disqualifying votes deemed \"invalid\" by the person in charge of the florida votes (which also happened to be working with the bush campain)\n \n \nAfter the Florida debacle, Michael Moore introduces us to the 'convoluted' relationship between the Bush family and the House of Saud. First off, though wouldn't consider myself \"politically correct,\" and though I think that the Saudi government is obviously not one of perfection, I found Moore's depiction of the Saudis to be unfair. The fact that Michael Moore chose to lump all Saudis and members of the Royal Saudi family into the terrorism category is completely hypocritical. Isn't Michael Moore supposed to be the liberal-minded peace-keeper, looking out for minorities and such? His attempt to convince ignorant viewers that the House of Saud is only akin to George Bush is a pure example of his manipulative nature. Needless to say, I was beyond surprised when those surrounding me in the movie theatre shook their heads at every Saudi that flashed upon the screen. Imagine if someone had depicted all blacks as Black Panthers or all Moslems as part of the Taliban! That isn't ok. But depicting every Saudi as a terrorist is, simply because they have a relationship with America and, thus, its current president. \nagain, moore doesnt depict every saudi as a terrorist. he doesnt even say that the royal family had any ties to terrorism once in the movie. this is a bogus point\n \n \nMoreover, if Bush \"wakes up in the morning, thinking about what's best for the Saudis, rather than thinking about what's best for you\" (as Moore claims), why did we invade Iraq? By invading Iraq and securing those oil fields, the Saudis probably stood to lose billions of dollars! Aside from that, the Saudi family members are Sunnis; the thought that we would liberate the Shiites of Iraq plagued them with fear. This is precisely why King Fahd exclaimed, before we went to war, that Saudi Arabia \"rejects outright any infringement on Iraq's unity, independence, resources and internal security, as well as a military occupation\"7 Michael Moore, however, presumes that maybe Bush \"told Prince Bandhar not to worry because he already had a plan\" (meaning Iraq). Yes, \"don't worry Prince Bandhar. We'll soon be taking billions of dollars away from your family and liberating your archenemy!\" I'm sure that made the prince feel wonderful. Moore obviously lacks common sense on this issue, or at least hopes his audience does. \n\n educated speculation indeed, but simply the author's deductions, not facts\n \n \nIn addition, Moore's overexerted attempt to paint the Bush-Bin Laden connection as anything spectacular is ridiculous. As the movie notes, the Bush family was connected to the Bin Ladens, (who claim to have disowned Osama), through the Carlyle Group. But the Carlyle group is a highly connected D.C. firm that specializes in aerospace and defense investments, so good luck finding any government official who isn't tied to the Bin Ladens. Even George Soros, who is probably the most anti-Bush figure in America right now, has 100,000,000 dollars invested in the Carlyle Group; Bill Clinton is affiliated with the Carlyle Group, along with his former Secretary of State, Madeline Albright8 and, according to John Hardman, \"Jimmy Carter met with 10 of Osama Bin Laden's brothers early in 2000 on a fund-raising trip for the Carter Center in Atlanta.\" If you ask me, George Bush needs a few more Saudi friends in order to keep up with the Democrats! \n\n this is great, the author affirms the bush-bin laden connection\n \n \nThe Bush-Bin Laden \"connection\" all comes into play as we \"learn\" that the White House allowed the Bin Laden family to fly out of America after the attacks. I can't blame Michael Moore for this mistake because there have been many new revelations since he began making his film. In fact, in an interview with The Hill, Richard Clark, the ex terrorism czar who recently wrote a book denouncing the Bush administration, admitted that it was his own sole decision to allow the Bin Ladens to fly out of the country. He stated that, \"I take responsibility for it. I don't think it was a mistake, and I'd do it again.\"9 While Moore was most likely unaware of this fact at the time he was making his movie, he was dishonest in implying that the Bin Ladens' departure from the U.S. was on September 11th, while all other planes were grounded. In fact, the Bin Ladens departed in the days following September 11th, when the grounding for commercial flights had already been lifted. \n\n this is gross ignorance. in the movie moore clearly shows the dates of the departing planes with the saudis as on 9/13. anybody who saw the movie would have seen that. this entire paragraph is erroneous, based on a false premise.\n \n \nMoore also accuses Bush of \"taking too many vacations.\" We've all heard this before. He cites a Washington Post article, claiming that during the first eight months in office, Bush was on \"vacation\" 42% of the time. I decided to do a little research on that article and- surprise surprise- found his claims to be a bit, shall we say, \"off.\" It was actually the first year and eight months in office and included trips to foreign nations to discuss foreign policy. According to that Washington Post article, most of that time was spent in Camp David.10 Perhaps this is why one of the photos we see of Bush \"vacationing\" at Camp David, is a picture of George W. Bush and none other than Tony Blair- the Prime Minister of England. And while Moore attempts to leave the audience with the impression that Camp David is a place for lounging and drinking beer, Wikipedia Encyclopedia states that it \"[is] often used for formal and informal discussion between the United States and world leaders,\" and cites many historical negotiations that have taken place there.11 \n\n this probably should have been addressed with the washington post. even if bush wasnt on vacation 42% of the time, this is really trivial to the overall movie\n \n \nMoore finally takes his biggest cheap shot at President Bush; chastising him for continuing to calmly read to students in Florida (for seven minutes) after just having been informed that the World Trade Center had been attacked. I couldn't help but giggle at this one. You know that leftists have got their panties in a twist, when they resort to this in order to criticize the president. I suppose Moore expected Bush to live up to his \"cowboy status\" by pulling a Glock out of a holster and yelling, \"BRING 'EM ON!\" On the contrary, Bush acted in a complete professional manner. Anyone could clearly see from the expression on his face, that he was in complete shock and distress, though he remained calm. In fact, the teacher who was in the room, at the time, recently came rushing to Bush's defense, explaining that his calming effect had, \"helped us get through a very difficult day.\" She admitted that she had not voted for Bush, but said, \"That day I would have voted for him.\"12 Ouch. \n\n the length of time bush stayed in the classroom and his reaction is also a trivial part of the movie, and whether is was included or not is inconsequential. like the author says, its a cheap shot, not really worth pursuing, and i agree\n \n \nMoore then begins to talk about the infamous memo that the White House received before September 11th, entitled, \"Bin Laden Wants to Attack America.\" Aside from the fact that we've known Bin Laden wanted to attack America since 1993, Moore forgets that the memo shed no light as to when or where the attack would take place. After all, fourteen out of the seventeen sentences in that PDB were historical in nature. But perhaps Bush purposely ignored the memo, knowing full-well what was about to happen. As Moore wonders, \"Maybe the war in Afghanistan was really about something else.\" He notes that \"In 1997 while George W. Bush was Governor of Texas, a delegation of Taliban leaders from Afghanistan flew to Houston to meet with Unocal executives to discuss the building of a pipeline through Afghanistan, bringing natural gas from the Caspian Sea.\" When I first heard this, I thought I had surely missed something. But then I remembered who had directed the garbage I was watching, and began thinking logically once again. What did Governor Bush have to do with the discussion to build a pipeline in Afghanistan? That pipeline was sought out under the Clinton Administration. Yes, Bush happened to be governor of Texas at the time, but that's completely irrelevant to the meetings which occurred between Unocal and the Taliban at Bill Clinton's concession!13 But Moore plays with words; purposely including irrelevant information regarding Bush, to connect him with the topic at hand. Moreover, when the pipeline deal was actually implemented in 2002, Unocal released a press release, stating that, \"Unocal has no plans or interest in becoming involved in any projects in Afghanistan.\"14 \n\n are you kidding??? the new afghani head of state, instated after the taliban was ousted, by the bush administration, is a former unocal consultant. and he approved the construction of the pipeline soon after taking office. compare the unocal statement to the reality, if you may\n \n \nIf I were to present an award to the slimiest element in Farenheit, it would have to go to Moore's depiction of Saddam Hussein and his regime before the invasion of Iraq. Oh it was a wonderful place. We see children flying kites, a woman getting married and Saddam holding a child. I can't even express the outrage that causes me, having known someone whose family was slaughtered by Saddam Hussein's henchmen during the invasion of Kuwait. This crossed the boundary between an anti-Bush documentary and a new form of Leni Riefenstahl-like propaganda. The way Moore portrayed Saddam Hussein was exactly the way that she portrayed Adolf Hitler, in order to gain support for the Nazi agenda. By claiming that Saddam Hussein \"never took the life of any American or threatened any American,\" Moore fails to acknowledge the 148 American soldiers killed (in combat) by Saddam Hussein's regime during the Gulf War,16 his attacks on American planes patrolling no-fly zones for a consecutive ten years after the Gulf War15 and his attempt to assassinate George H.W. Bush; but I guess military personnel and Republican presidents don't count. And of course, it wouldn't be a Michael Moore film without the footage of those evil, brutal American soldiers of ours. Not one of them is cast in a good light. Instead, we are shown only what Michael Moore wants us to see- insensitive hicks, just looking for a thrill and a few soldiers who are vehemently opposed to the war. There are no heroes; few patriots- only Moore's presentation of how he views Americans. He also fails to mention that the structure we see being so ferociously destroyed by American explosives was Saddam's Iraqi Ministry of Defense.17 Needless to say, he furthers the idea that the U.S. military is reckless, heartless, and brainless. \n\n the pre-invasion depiction of iraq is also trivial. moore is obviouslu biased against the war, so he shows his side of the story. this is clearly not a balanced view, so i'll give you that\n \n \nThen, of course, we're subjected to the baseless rhetoric about the PATRIOT Act. I found it interesting that while Michael Moore decides to \"read\" the Act to the senators from his ice cream truck (in order to point out its many over-looked \"flaws\"), the audience never hears it. We don't even hear a snippet of the PATRIOT Act's abuse of civil liberties. Why? Because Michael Moore knows quite well that if we were to hear or read the PATRIOT Act for ourselves, we would realize how necessary and, in fact, over-due it was. For anyone who is unfamiliar with the PATRIOT Act, it represented a huge breakthrough in the way our intelligence shares information. Sec. 203 finally allowed law enforcement to share information with intelligence agencies. This is crucial to our national defense and, indeed, imperative, if we wish to prevent another 9/11. Despite the fact that there have been no documented Civil Rights abuses under the PATRIOT Act, Moore rounds up a few paranoid cooks that insist they were targeted by the FBI, for being against the war. In reality, the PATRIOT Act allows the same search and seizure methods that are already allotted for local crime. Search warrants and \"reasonable cause\" are still mandatory under the PATRIOT Act.18 \n\n many americans oppose the patriot act regardless of if moore uses it or not. i still dont see how this is pointing to one of moores lies or deceptions\n \n [quote]Moore then pulls a stunt which had the audience in tears. He spoke with Representative Porter Goss, who was defending the PATRIOT ACT. Gross informs Moore that problems with the PATRIOT Act can be reported by calling a toll-free \"800 number.\" We then see words flashed across the screen, informing the audience that there is no \"800 number,\" but that Goss does have a private telephone line, as he flashes their (202) office number across the screen. Once again, while Moore won a few laughs, he was lying through his teeth. The U.S. House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (where problems with the PATRIOT act can be reported) does have a toll-free number, though its prefix is (877). The number is 1-877-858-9040.19 Somebody ought to tell Moore, so he doesn't have to go through the trouble of yelling it over a loud-speaker in an ice cream truck again. [/quot]\n unbelievably trivial. defending the fact that goss indeed has a toll-free number is really that substantial?\n \n \nOf course it wouldn't be a Michael Moore film without him doing what he's famous for- heckling unsuspecting people and making them look crazy for not taking him seriously. He approaches some Congressmen, in order to get them to \"sign their kids up for the army.\" It was just asinine. How does a parent sign their child up for the army? His rationale for doing so is that \"only one congressman has a son or daughter enlisted in the armed forces.\" FLAT-OUT-LIE. According to Kelly Beaucar, who wrote a Fox News article, entitled, Handful of Congressman Send Their Kids to War, \"There are at least seven members of Congress with children in the Armed Forces.\" In fact, there are eight: Tim Johnson(D), Marilyn Musgrave(R), Ed Schrock(R), Joe Wilson(R), John Kline(R), Duncan Hunter(R), Todd Akin(R)20, and Joe Biden(D)21 are all Congressmen who have children currently serving in the military, not to mention the 36 veterans in congress22. And Moore would probably disheartened to know that his favorite punching bag, John Ashcroft, also had a son serving in the military.23 \n\n another excellent point that shows moore lying about the number of congress members with kids in the armed forces. well done\n \n \nMoore seems to have a knack for ignoring relevant information. Upon discussing the Coalition of the Willing, he only mentions the small countries that don't possess troops, while leaving out the countries which do, such as Poland, England and Australia.24 And of course we're supposed to be disgusted that our armed forces possess large quantities of low-income earners and minorities, and that recruiters often go to the more unfortunate towns, looking for people to enlist. Think about that argument. Leftists like Moore are upset when a company doesn't hire enough minorities and upset when the military hires too many! Only someone as ungrateful as Michael Moore, could be appalled at the fact that low-income earners from places like Flint, MI are \"targeted\" by the military and granted the greatest opportunities that America has to offer- education, money, benefits, housing, training, food and heroism. But, of course, Moore sees none of these things. He is still too blinded by his hatred for the United States and his belief that the U.S. military is the embodiment of shame. \n\n i laughed when i saw this in the movie. obviously the coalition is bigger than moore's list. i showed this already as a blatant deception, at least 3 times in this thread and the other one\n \n \nMichael Moore ends Farenheit 9/11 with a quote from George Orwell. I, myself, have a quote from George Orwell that Moore just may have overlooked. \n \"If you hamper the war effort of one side, you automatically help out that of the other. Nor is there any real way of remaining outside such a war as the present one. In practice, he that is not with me is against me.\"25 I couldn't have said it better myself. \n \n\n cool, no comment\n \n while we've seen these points repeatedly, and while the authors have been meticulous in their scrutiny, if the only points they can address are the most mundane and trivial ones, then this is really just a poor attempt to tear at the movies credibility. the real major points that are presented in the movie are continually left uncontested, and of all the \"deceptions\" detected, nobody has been able to override the main message the movie conveys, nor show that his views are based on falsities\n \n in the future i'll just be using this post as reference, because i'm repeating myslf",

I and a few others asked you to provide links to these.

It&#8217;s true that Unocal had sought such a pipeline, and at one point Taliban officials were courted by the United States when it looked as if they could make such a deal happen. Moore points out that Taliban officials traveled to Texas in 1997 when Bush was governor. He fails to point out that all this happened with the Clinton administration at the negotiating table.  It is highly unlikely that policymakers would go to war for a single pipeline, but even if that were plausible it is clear that both Democrats and Republicans alike have been mixed up in that particular scheme. \n\n \n \n \n \n ...and this:\n\n The centerpiece of Moore&#8217;s analysis of U.S. policy in the Middle East is the relationship of the Bush family to the Saudis and the bin Laden family. The film appears to argue that those business interests, primarily through the Carlyle Group, led the administration to favor the Saudis to the point of ignoring potential Saudi complicity in the attacks of 9/11. After laying out the nature of those business dealings, Moore implies that the Bushes are literally on the take. \n \n It is certainly true that the Bush family and its cronies have a relationship with Saudi Arabia that has led officials to overlook Saudi human-rights abuses and the support that many Saudis give to movements such as al Qaeda. That is true of the Bushes, just as it was of the Clinton administration and, in fact, every post-World War II president. Ever since FDR cut a deal with the House of Saud giving U.S. support in exchange for cooperation on the flow of oil and oil profits, U.S. administrations have been playing ball with the Saudis.  The relationship is sometimes tense but has continued through ups and downs, with both sides getting at least part of what they need from the other. Concentrating on Bush family business connections ignores that history and encourages viewers to see the problem as specific to Bush. Would a Gore administration have treated the Saudis differently after 9/11? There&#8217;s no reason to think so, and Moore offers no evidence or argument why it would have. \n\n \n \n \n ...and this:\n \n \n\n And what of the analysis of Iraq? Moore is correct in pointing out that U.S. support for Iraq during the 1980s, when Saddam Hussein&#8217;s war on Iran was looked upon favorably by U.S. policymakers, was a central part of Reagan and Bush I policy up to the Gulf War. And he&#8217;s correct in pointing out that Bush II&#8217;s invasion and occupation have caused great suffering in Iraq. What is missing is the intervening eight years in which the Clinton administration used the harshest economic embargo in modern history and regular bombing to further devastate an already devastated country. He fails to point out that Clinton killed more Iraqis through that policy than either of the Bush presidents. He fails to mention the 1998 Clinton cruise missile attack on Iraq, which was every bit as illegal as the 2003 invasion. \n\n \n There may be more, but this is enough to say that you may have overlooked something.\n \n While I do not agree with Jensen on every point, I do interpret some of what he says as evidence of deception by Moore, especially when the film is labeled a documentary.",

   "Here are some more comments from ....\n \n \n \n\n First, (name), you sound foolish with your logic. People say \"I'm not a bigot; some of my best friends are black!\" because being racist is frowned upon. Being liberal/conservative is not looked upon in that light. I have nothing to lose if I said I'm conservative, whereas if I said I was racist, I'd be a pariah. Silly logic...and it comes off disingenuous to you because you would hope that all liberals liked this movie. I think it's pretty funny you just interpret my not liking the movie as indicative of not being liberal. The very fact that I point out the fact that I'm liberal and disliked the movie is important because I feel, no I know, that many people support themes liberal/conservative themes blindly. I wonder how many people are objective in watching a movie like this, which is full of misleading information and cheap shots. Also, I never said I'm moving more toward the middle. I wrote, \"If this keeps up, I will be moving towards the center.\" IF this keeps up, being the key words. As for my one word review, I probably could have done better by just not writing anything at all, but like I said, Hitchens does a pretty good job of explaining things. But what's with the \"People don't sum it up with one word\" and \"Trust me on this\" garbage? I'm not a professional, and I don't have any guidelines. While saying one word, like I said, is a bit silly, I NOTED that Hitchens words spoke for myself. There is no problem with that. Trust me on this... \n \n As for (name), you just didn't read the article, or more likely, read but have already convinced yourself that the movie is good. Lies, or misleads, are catalogued in Hitchens piece. I'll list a few: The Moore supposition that we are buddy/buddy with the Saudis doesn't work with the Iraq War; the Saudis didn't want that at all because Iraq being resuscitated can only hurt their power in the Middle East. Bin Laden's family leaving was investigated by 9/11 commission and nothing was found. Moreover, Clarke, who was represented in the piece as saying that we simply let them out of the country, was in fact the person IN CHARGE of letting them leave. How about the whole \"Iraqi civilians getting bombed ruthlessly\" scene, without ONE MENTION of Saddam's regime? Saddam gassed entire towns, including women and children. Moore made it look like we created a mess, whereas in reality there was already one there. \n I could go on, but like I said, I like the way Hitchens wrote it. \n\n *****\n \n\n I am Pro-porn, pro-gay marriage, pro-freedom of speech (unlike most left-nazia, who only want left speech legal) and anti-Bush, and I hate Michael Moore with a passion. People think that the only people who hate this movie are conservatives, but they are quite wrong...here in Jersey, most everybody I know can't stand Moore. \n \n There is a big differene between liberals with a lower case \"l\" and Liberals with an uppercase \"L\", if you haven't noticed. \n \n Ohh, and I wonder why the terrorist training camp that was found in Iraq was not mentioned in F/9-11? Moore refuses to awknowledge the existince of Salm Pak...wonder why? \n \n And I am still against the war in Iraq. They simply could have assassinated Saddam and have gotten the same effect. \n \n\n *****\n \n\n I don't know what's the deal with all Moore-worshippers claiming that \n everyone who say they are liberal AND have a problem with this movie are infact \n not liberals at all. It's just ridiculous, so if you do not approve Moore and \n his movies, you can't be a liberal? Is that how it goes? Well, Moore-logic by Moore-fans, I guess it makes perfect sense. \n \n I guess it's just too impossible to believe that there are people, myself included, who agree with the message but not by with the way it's carried out. \n Just because Moore believes in a lot of same things I do doesn't mean that I would tolerate all the cheap shots, lies, distortion and mean-spirited behaviour.  \n \n I just expect a lot higher standard from someone who claims to be a humane and liberal leftist. \n \n",

   "And a few more:\n \n \n\n During the pre-civil war days in the south, pro-slavery propaganda artists used to draw political cartoons showing blacks having dances and fun while enslaved, and then contrasting it with a freed slave in a slum in Atlanta or Chicago, alone, and sad. The artists point was to show how blacks were better off during slavery. And here's the thing. They were being \"honest.\" There most likely were slaves who had fun at certain times during their enslavement, and their most certainly were freed slaves who had hard times. The ridiculousness of it all is obvious to all of us, because we can see how the artist left out all the torture and pain that occured during slavery, and the freedom and dignity the majority of slaves received when freed. \n \n Moore is doing the same thing with the before and after scenes of Iraq. He leaves out the overwhelming amount of horrors that occured during Saddam's reign, and showing the relatively small amount of violence that occured when coalition troops chased that rat out of Bagdhad. He is a master propaganda artist. Just as those pro-slavery types influenced millions across the south with deceit and half-truths, Moore is doing the same today. \n \n If you want to hate Bush, find your own reasons, don't be a sucker for a good liar. \n\n \n \n \n \n\n This movie just confirms my feeling of dislike towards Michael Moore.\n \n Just gonna say a few things to Michael Moore:\n \n 1) If you don't like the fact that Young kids and poor persons are going to war, then get off your fat, rich *** and get the **** over there.\n \n 2) There is such a thing as privacy issues, not everything is a conspiracy.\n \n 3) Don't ever exploit another mother of a dead Iraqi troop and use her emotions of hatred to \"prove\" your point again, that was just sickening.\n \n \n \n \n \n\n Well said!

   "Been away for a few weeks so missed a lot of the debate unfortuntely.\n \n I've never thought of Michael Moore as much more than a liar, so am not surprised at the sheer amount of deceit and outright tripe his latest offering serves up. I actually think that Leni Riefenstahl, Hitler's propagandist, would be envious of this work. She should be, because it makes Triumph of the Will almost seem balanced.\n \n But what has shocked me most of all is the reactions of everyday people, not unlike the standing ovations and weeping by those at the Cannes Film Festival, whom were a poisonously anti-american crowd, gave Moore before a jury of leftists and nihilists handed him the Palme d'Or. \n \n It is enough to worry anyone who prizes truth and civilization, and I couldn't help but look at many of the people around me, and wonder: are they so cretinous or so easily mislead that they do not know that Moore lies? Or are they, like many of the Left, so immoral or frivolous as to not care that he lies as long as his lies are sweet?\n \n Before tackling just some of the dozens of deceptions, distortions, evasions and half truths Moore peddles in this film, lets look at the big lie he builds with them. If there is an arguement in Fahrenheit 9/11, it is this: George W Bush stole an election to become President of the United States, and invaded Afghanistan and Iraq to please the Saudis who bribed him, the oil companies who hired him and the armaments companies who squired him.\n \n Bush isn't fighting a war on terror - look at how pally he is with the family of Al-Qaida boss Osama bin Laden. His war is really against Americans. This is Moore's biggest lie, and few of his fans mind that it's as incoherent as it is mad. For a start, the Saudis bitterly opposed the war on Iraq, not least because thy didn't want Iraq's oil to flow again. \n \n So if Bush has been bought off by the Saudis, he's chosen a crazy way to please them. In fact, he may have indeed helped undermined the Saudi regime by bringing freedom to Iraq and Afghanistan, and inspiring Saudis to ask why they can't have some too.\n \n Let's now look at the \"facts\" behind Moore's big lie. Fahrenheit 9/11 opens with scenes from the US presidential race in 2000. We see Democrat candidate Al Gore boogying under a big \"Florida Victory\" sign, as TV anchors declare he's won the vote in Florida and, therefore, the election. \n \n But, Moore says, Rupert Murdoch's Fox News Channel, which hires a Bush cousin, suddenly breaks in to announce there's been a mistake and Bush has won instead. The film shows CBS and CNN calling Florida for Al Gore. According to the narrator, \"Then something called the Fox News Channel called the election in favor of the other guy....All of a sudden the other networks said, 'Hey, if Fox said it, it must be true.'\" We then see NBC anchor Tom Brokaw stating, \"All of us networks made a mistake and projected Florida in the Al Gore column. It was our mistake.\" \n \n Moore thus creates the false impression that the networks withdrew their claim about Gore winning Florida when they heard that Fox said that Bush won Florida. Conspiracy! But how could Bush steal the election in Florida?\n \n Simple, says Mike Moore, \"Make sure the chairman of your campaign (Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris) is also the vote count woman.\" And knock voters off the rolls \"who aren't likely to vote for you - you can usually tell them by the color of their skin.\" Lastly, get your pals on the supreme court to ban another recount of votes, because, as an \"expert\" tells Moore in the film, \"Under every (recount) scenario Gore won the election.\"\n \n Already we are up to our knees in Moore's ****. The shots of Goore partying are taken before the polls had opened. It was not Fox, but the left wing CNN which was the first network to say that Gore hadn't won, after all. The FOX Channel retracted it's statement that Gore had won Florida 4 HOURS after both CNN and CBS had retracted their statement. \n \n Also, Harris was not in charge of counting votes. Vote counting in Florida is performed by the election commissioners in each of Florida's counties. The Florida Secretary of State merely certifies the reported vote. The office does not count votes.\n \n Another falsehood: \n \nA six-month study by a consortium including the New York Times, Washington Post and CNN disproves Fahrenheit's claim that Gore won under any scenario. \n \n\n \n This directly disproves the claims made in the film that Gore would have won under ANY Scenario. The only scenarios in which Gore would have won Florida involved a type of recount which Gore never asked for in his law suit, and were also illegal under Florida Law. \n \n My God, all of these \"facts\" are really nothing more than a pile of ****. The list just goes on and on and on. I think it would be easier to just post a link and left you read for yourselves (I'm sure it would have already been posted, but by people continuing to defend the \"documentary,\" you surely could not have properly read it). I feel like standing at the exists of cinemas and handing out a list of the 50-60 deceits in this film so that people do not get brainwashed by this drivel. \n \n http://www.davekopel.com/Terror/Fiftysix-Deceits-in-Fahrenheit-911.htm",

   "squid. i already addressed kopel's \"56 deciets\" essay. very comprehensive in pointing out minor technical flaws, but an absolute failure in showing that there were lies in the movie. \n \nGeorge W Bush stole an election to become President of the United States, and invaded Afghanistan and Iraq to please the Saudis who bribed him, the oil companies who hired him and the armaments companies who squired him.\n \n Bush isn't fighting a war on terror - look at how pally he is with the family of Al-Qaida boss Osama bin Laden. His war is really against Americans. \n\n kopel's critiq of the movie does counter any of these conclusions. the fact remains that bush's brother was the goveror of florida, his campaign chair person was the vote florida secretary of state and the elections board in florida did eliminate thousands of voters estimated to vote democrat. those are the claims moore made, none of which have been refuted\n \n lets look at the invasion of afghanistan and iraq. we all know that the bin ladens, including osama, are saudis. and we also know that 15 of the 19 hijackers that executed the attacks were saudis. and we also know that a large element of al qaeda is in saudi arabia. however, the saudis invested heavily in the carlyle groups companies that the bush's were heads of. so instead of sending troops to saudi arabia, we sent troops into iraq, a country that had no terrorist affilliation, under a regime that wasnt even muslim.\n \n we attacked afghanistan with less than 1/10th the troops in iraq, made a very weak effort of looking for bin laden, and gave up after a few months, with the taliban ousted and not much else accomplished (oh yeah, except the new government approved the building of the unocal pipeline)\n \n in iraq we've ousted saddams government and stationed about 140000 troops there, telling them they are fighting terrorism. so far the american death toll just passed 900, and about 99% of the iraqis killed are innocent civillians. the terrorists, though bold enough to capture americans and send videos to the press, are still at large, and seemingly growing in numbers.\n \n so how exactly is moore's view based on lies?",

   "And knock voters off the rolls \"who aren't likely to vote for you - you can usually tell them by the color of their skin.\"\n \n \nBut a review of state records, internal e-mails of DBT employees and testimony before the civil rights commission and an elections task force showed no evidence that minorities were specifically targeted. \n \n \n \nThe supervisors wrote warning letters to the suspected felons, giving them one to two months to appeal before they were dropped from the rolls. \n \n \n http://www.commondreams.org/headlines01/0527-03.htm\n \n So, can you tell me what Moore was trying to say here? Above is a direct quote about removing people from the polls who might vote against Bush, a plainly obvious ascertion that people were dis-allowed to vote because of the colour of their skin. That is false.\n \n People were deemed ineligable to vote because they were flagged as felons. Although not all were actually criminals, those struck off the voting lists were sent news of this, and had ample time to appeal the decision. The reason for this major crack down was because of the debarcle that was the Miami mayoral elections of 1998 where convicted felons, as well as dead people, voted. Where does the persons race come into consideration at all by the DBT? Nowhere, so why is it mentioned? Let me put it to you that the reason was this: Moore used that statement to further shock ignorant and uninformed viewers, who seem to take all of what he says on face value, into believing that the Bush administration is evil.\n \n In any case, some of the counties (20 odd) dis-regarded the list allowing felons to vote. Couple that with the fact that News outlets called the ballot closed and that Gore had won an hour before it actually had in some places, meaning last minute Bush supporters may not have voted, Gore may have got more votes than he should have, and Bush may have received less.\n \n \nAnalysis by Abigail Thernstrom and Russell G. Redenbaugh, dissenting from a report by the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, suggests that about 5,600 felons voted illegally in Florida.\n (http://www.manhattan-institute.org/final_dissent.pdf)\n \n \nWhen allowed to vote, felons vote approximately 69 percent Democratic, according to a study in the American Sociological Review. Therefore, if the thousands of felons in the non-purging 20 counties had not been illegally allowed to vote, it is likely that Bush's statewide margin would have been substantially larger.\n \n \n Right, so how was it Bush stole the election again?",

   "however, the saudis invested heavily in the carlyle groups companies that the bush's were heads of. so instead of sending troops to saudi arabia, we sent troops into iraq, a country that had no terrorist affilliation, under a regime that wasnt even muslim.\n \n \n unkerpaulie, this is where you arguement seriously falls down I believe. Firstly, the Saudis invested approximately 90% of their total monies into the Carlyle Group before Bush was a major player in the organisation. To try and project the theory that the Bush administration did not invade Saudi Arabia because of their investment in Carlyle is utter rubbish. This is simply becasue Bush Snr. was not in the picture when the bulk of the deals were made concerning the Saudis and Carlyle, and therefore it makes no sense that G. Bush would be protecting the Saudis for that reason.\n \n And secondly, the reason that the coalition of the willing invaded Iraq was becuase of the perceived threat of WMD's. Do no try and muddle the reaction to 9/11 and the threat of MWD's, which is what Moore attempts to do also. but I wouldn't might betting there were terrorist affiliations anyway. What about the Hussein regime paying Palestinian families of suicide bombers?\n \n Again, why would Bush invade Iraq and Afghanistan if he was aligned with the Saudis to the degree Moore, and his followers, believe him to be anyway? Maybe not right away, but Iraq's oil will again flow uninterupted, and how can that be good for the Saudi's? The US, and other nations have bought democracy to previous dictatorships in the Middle-East, how is that a favor to the Saudis?\n \n Still would like to know how Bush stole the 2000 election also.

This is simply becasue Bush Snr. was not in the picture when the bulk of the deals were made concerning the Saudis and Carlyle, and therefore it makes no sense that G. Bush would be protecting the Saudis for that reason.\n\n again, lets look at the circumstances. within 24 hours of the 9/11 attacks, the fbi already knew that bin ladin was responsible. within 72 hours of the attacks the fbi approves flights taking 144 saudis, including 26 bin ladin family members out of the country. 15 of the 19 hijackers were saudis. bin laden himself is a saudi.\n \n so you tell me, exactly why didnt bush send troops to saudi arabia as part of his \"war on terrorism\" campaign?\n \n \n the reason that the coalition of the willing invaded Iraq was becuase of the perceived threat of WMD's. Do no try and muddle the reaction to 9/11 and the threat of MWD's, which is what Moore attempts to do also. but I wouldn't might betting there were terrorist affiliations anyway. What about the Hussein regime paying Palestinian families of suicide bombers?\n\n i am well aware that the attack on iraq is not even remotely connected to the \"war on terrorism\". i am also aware that bush was fully aware that saddam possessed no wmds or plans to attack america. i am also aware that any terrorist groups resident in iraq were actually enemies of saddam that were at one time work with bin laden himself to assissinate saddam. in other words, for any terrorists groups in iraq, we have evidence that saddam was not just unaffilliated, but opposed to them. (page 5 paragraph 4 of this report from the 9/11 commission. look it up)\n \n so exactly what did attacking saddam have to do with bush's declared \"war on terrorism\"?\n \n \nAgain, why would Bush invade Iraq and Afghanistan if he was aligned with the Saudis to the degree Moore, and his followers, believe him to be anyway? Maybe not right away, but Iraq's oil will again flow uninterupted, and how can that be good for the Saudi's? The US, and other nations have bought democracy to previous dictatorships in the Middle-East, how is that a favor to the Saudis?\n\n it doesnt have to favor the saudis, it just has to favor bush. with the carlyle group subcontracting the administration of oil production, the saudis have everything to gain\n \n \nStill would like to know how Bush stole the 2000 election also. How can you not say that Moore's 'Documentary' is not fundamentally founded on lies and deceit unkerpaulie?\n\n listen, i admitted many times that moore's film contains deceit and misleading sections, but for the majority of the film the facts are verified and irrefutable. if you ignore the truth just because the source has lied in the past, then you're actually believing a lie. im not a moore follower or even a democrat. but i can filter out the pollitical rhetoric and identify the truths.",

You rely on what was found and not found after the fact to argue that we should have known this and that before invading.\n \n Personally , I think he shipped them across the border or split them into small parcels and passed them out to his renegade supporters.\n\n BEFORE the invasion there were scores of investigative inspectors that told america saddam has no wmds. BEFORE the invasion, bush was aware that al qaeda had no iraqi connection. BEFORE the invasion bush was advised by the UN to not attack iraq on the grounds of them being a threat to security. we all knew this. i for one wanted bush to leave an afghanistan-shaped crater where afghanistan is, we were gung ho after pakistan, and the palestinians that were celebrating the days after the towers fell. but bush always had an agenda to attack iraq, so in the face of all the contradictory evidence, bush still invaded iraq.\n \n its no surprise that we found no wmds, no war plans, no al qaeda connection and not terrorist link. this information was known all along. if you were actually surprised that nothing turned up, then you are more gullible to what the media says than you realise. and seeing as you still have hope that eventually something will be found, then you are not only gullible but stubborn",

   "Fahrenheit 9/11\n Directed by Michael Moore\n Rated M\n Cinemas everywhere\n \n The job of an intelligence service, as we have been told a lot recently, is to speak truth unto power. At times, this is also the job of the documentary film maker, but Michael Moore inverts the role - he's an intelligence service for the rest of us. That is why he is a hero for the young.\n \n Journalists are supposed to do this too, but I think one reason that his films are so successful is that journalists are failing in that task. The public no longer sees journalists as independent of the powerful, if they ever did. \n \n Let me put it another way: when journalism becomes so degraded that Fox News can get away with the slogan \"We report, you decide\", then Michael Moore is what you get in opposition. He makes no secret of his political aim - to unseat George Bush at the next US election. This signals that he is not a journalist, but a player. Mr Moore Goes To Washington, one might say, but he's a lot more savvy than Frank Capra's Longfellow Deeds. \n \n Not being a journalist can be a bonus for his audience. Moore connects with a great deal of disillusionment in Western countries about \"what we're not being told\". His ungainly appearance and lack of physical vanity shows that he is not part of the television world, where clothes and make up maketh the man or woman. \n \n In Fahrenheit 9/11, he makes fun of the way the powerful groom themselves before the TV feeds go live. He shows a montage of Bush Administration heavies being buffed and powdered. The Deputy Secretary of Defence, Paul Wolfowitz, licks his comb and slicks down his quiff, in a scene that provokes revulsion from the audience. Sure it is a cheap shot, but it is also part of the film's visual strategy, to show the unshown, to give us the sense that Moore includes the bits the television shows leave out. This is partly rhetorical - and Moore is a master of rhetorical visual techniques - but it is sometimes more than that. \n \n When he shows us footage of the US president at a Florida elementary school on the morning of September 11, 2001, learning that a second plane has hit the World Trade Centre, the look on Bush's face is not rhetorical. We get to study it, because Moore lets it run - not for the seven minutes that Bush sat there and did nothing, but long enough for us to wonder if this is the face of a man who, at that moment, had no idea what to do. \n \n Journalism fails when confronted with those seven minutes, because there is no answer to the question of what Bush was thinking, but polemic comes into its own. Moore interjects and suggests that he may have been thinking \"which one of them screwed me?\" - the Taliban or Saddam Hussein, both once armed and advised by the US government, or the Saudis, some of whose money may have secretly funded al-Qaeda? \"Damn, it was them [Saudis],\" Moore says, as if he is the voice in Bush's head.\n \n Moore's polemic is powerful and energising for audiences, because it connects many dots in a way that journalism rarely can, because it requires a higher standard of proof (or ought to). The public does not demand the same level of proof from the filmmaker, and Moore knows that. \n \n In a country where a large proportion of the population believes the US Government has covered up evidence of alien landings, the idea that George Bush went soft on the Saudis because his family and the bin Laden's are financially connected is not that much of a stretch. Never mind that Moore fails to make the case that bin Laden family money ever reached the Bush family; the film makes you think it does, by a bombardment of suggestions, and that makes people angry.\n \n The effectiveness of Fahrenheit 9/11 relies on the anger that many people already feel, believing that they were lied to about the need to go to war in Iraq. The film's release comes at a time of great distrust among the American people and offers a credible interpretation of the facts. Just how credible depends on how much you know and how much you care to check. \n \n Moore's standard of proof is sometimes too low. He does his cause no credit by making slippery conclusions and never giving anyone the benefit of the doubt. At the same time, he does us all a favour by his dogged pursuit of the powerful, and his refusal to cosy up to them.\n http://smh.com.au/articles/2004/07/28/1090694022292.html?oneclick=true",
