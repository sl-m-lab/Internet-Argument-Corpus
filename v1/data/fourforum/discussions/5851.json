Failure to give the informed-consent warning could have resulted in 30 days in jail and a $200 fine.\n \n U.S. District Judge Karen Schreier of Rapid City ruled that Planned Parenthood of Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota, which sued the state, has shown it has a fair chance of winning on its claim that the proposed law infringes on the First Amendment rights of doctors.\n \n A hearing is set for October on Planned Parenthood's request for a permanent order barring the state from enacting the law.\n \n The measure, passed by the 2005 Legislature, would make a doctor inform a woman that she has a legal relationship with her \"unborn child,\" and the relationship will be terminated by an abortion that will end the life of that \"human being.\"\n \n \"The South Dakota statute requires abortion doctors to enunciate the state's viewpoint on an unsettled medical, philosophical, theological and scientific issue - that is, whether a fetus is a human being,\" the judge wrote in an order granting Planned Parenthood a preliminary injunction. . . .",

   "Okey dokey, so in reference to:\n \nThe measure, passed by the 2005 Legislature, would make a doctor inform a woman that she has a legal relationship with her \"unborn child,\" and the relationship will be terminated by an abortion that will end the life of that \"human being.\"\nWhat the devil does the preceding have to do with medical or emotional issues? The statement that a woman \" has a legal relationship with her 'unborn child,' and the relationship will be terminated by an abortion that will end the life of that 'human being,'\" imposes a mythical relationship upon the woman that does not exist. Why, all of a sudden, does a woman have \"a legal relationship with her 'unborn child'\"? Did she sign a contract with the entity that resides in her womb?\n \n To be quite frank, that is the goofiest off-the-wall statement I have ever seen.",
