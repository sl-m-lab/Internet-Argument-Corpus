There is a big difference in &#8220;kill&#8221; to &#8220;murder&#8221;.\n\n \n To emclean:\n This is where you have to use common sense. When the Bible says not to kill or not to commit murder, it is obviously refering to having a guilty mind and a guilty act. You will of course logically need to interpret in what sense and context the Bible is talking about. As for the different translations, many were done at different times and hence, the KJV will use the old words while the Australian Version will use slang. The important thing to realise is that the message and context is the same in all versions. I don't think that the translation argument is a very strong one. All versions contain the Fall of Adam, the Flood, the events regarding Jesus' life, etc.",

There is a big difference in \"kill\" to \"murder\".\n\n \n \n I think the reason for the differences in translations is because the translations i think are geared more to audience. There are easier translations for little kids and those who have a hard time with bigger words. Another thing that has to be taken into account is that it is not always easy to translate exactly from one language to another. Some English words have several equivalents in other languages so the differences in the translations come from which equivalent was chosen by the translators.\n \n \n P.S.
