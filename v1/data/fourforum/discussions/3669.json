   "NATIONAL 23 PERCENT SALES LEVY\n 'Fair tax' deserves a second look\n \n JIM ULLOM\n \n \n Now that South Carolina's U.S. Senate race has been decided, it is time to address income tax reform without the politics. You've heard [Inez Tenenbaum's] assertions that [victor Jim DeMint was advocating] a 23 percent sales tax on everything you purchase. Now it's time to hear, as Paul Harvey says, the rest of the story.\n \n The fair tax proposal covers three basic areas:\n \n Payroll taxes. Each payday, I lose 17.5 percent of my paycheck to taxes\n \n (10 percent to income tax, 6.1 percent to Social Security and 1.4 percent to Medicare). This fair tax proposal would let me keep that 17.5 percent.\n \n My employer would no longer pay corporate income taxes or the employer portion of my Social Security and Medicare taxes (another\n \n 7.5 percent of my salary). Economics experts predict that companies would be able to reduce the cost of their product by 25 percent to 30 percent by removing these \"embedded taxes.\" Market competition would then force companies to lower their prices to remain competitive.\n \n Prebate. Based on the federal poverty guidelines, my wife and I would receive a $240 check from the government each month. A family of four would receive $361. This \"prebate\" would be sent to every household that chose to register. This ensures that no one would end up paying the sales tax on the basic necessities of life. The combination of this prebate and the additional 17.5 percent no longer being withheld from my paycheck would more than compensate for the additional sales tax, even if no one was willing to reduce the price of their products.\n \n Consumption. A national retail sales tax of 23 percent (or less) would be added to purchases of new goods and services. Used goods, education tuition. Prices of retail items would be expected to drop by at least 20 percent due to the removal of the embedded payroll taxes mentioned previously. Adding the 23 percent tax back onto the lower priced item would result in a \"wash\" - no real difference in the total paid. In addition, state sales taxes would be figured on the lower cost of the item.\n \n This proposal would eliminate the need for tax shelters, tax credits, tax offsets, etc. You would no longer be forced to bare your soul to the Internal Revenue Service and be considered guilty until proven innocent when undergoing an IRS audit. The underground economy (drug dealers, prostitutes, gamblers, etc.) would end up paying federal taxes when they buy a new car, fancy clothes or glitzy jewelry. The IRS (as we know it) would be abolished. The only policing necessary would be to audit RETAIL business returns. Those returns could be simple - \"what's the value of your sales?\" and \"send in 23 percent of it.\" That's the ultimate in flat taxes.\n \n This proposal would also promote savings, since we would no longer be taxed on the interest we earn or on the gains we make in the stock market. The expected increase in consumer spending would translate into increased manufacturing and subsequent job growth.\n \n Finally, April 15 would be just another day. We would never again be required to spend hours explaining what we earned and why we feel we should get some of our money back.\n \n This idea has been more than 10 years and $22 million in the planning. It may not be perfect, but it beats the heck out of the out-of-control income tax method we currently have to endure.\n \n You can learn more about this proposal and its sponsors by visiting www.fairtax.org.",

   "So it will promote spending and not saving?\n\n \n In our service based economy a switch from spending to saving would create economic paralysis.

   "So it will promote spending and not saving?\n\n \n The income tax  retards economic performance by creating a significant bias against saving and investment through double, triple and even quadruple taxation. \n \n Initially, wage and salary income are taxed when they are earned. Then, if wages and salaries are saved or invested, the resulting benefits are taxed again and again and sometimes again still. All income derived from investment is taxed. If an income-producing asset such as a stock, bond, equipment or real estate is sold for more than it was purchased, the increase in the value of the capital investment-the capital gain-is taxed. Corporate income (including capital gains) is taxed at the corporate level and again when it is paid to shareholders as dividends. Intercorporate dividends are also often subject to tax, creating yet another level of taxation. When the taxpayer dies, the estate and gift tax may tax his or her investments one final time.\n \n Replacing the current tax system with the FairTax would eliminate the tax bias against saving and investment. Harvard economist Dale Jorgenson estimates that, after implementation of the sales tax, yearly real investment would initially increase by 80 percent relative to the investment that would be made under present law. Jorgenson's research shows that this increase would gradually decline over the period of a decade to 20 percent. (Dale W. Jorgenson, Harvard University, \"The Impact of Taxing Consumption,\" Testimony before the Committee on Ways and Means, U.S. House of Representatives, March 27, 1996.)\n \n Boston University economist Laurence Kotlikoff also predicts an investment boom. Measuring the change in the size of the overall capital invested (rather than annual investment), he predicts that within 10 years total invested capital will be 17 percent larger than it would be under the present tax system. (Laurence J. Kotlikoff, Boston University, Testimony before the Committee on Ways and Means, U.S. House of Representatives, June 6, 1995. See also, \"The Economic Impact of Replacing Federal Income Taxes with a Sales Tax,\" Laurence J. Kotlikoff, April 15, 1993, Cato Institute.)\n \n The higher productivity caused by more investment per worker is one of the few ways to make U.S. goods more competitive while maintaining high living standards. The U.S. has lower rates of capital formation and a lower savings rate than most of its major trading partners, including Japan, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Italy and Canada. (Statistical Abstract of the United States, 1999, Table 1365, p. 843.)\n \n Although domestic capital investment is a leading factor influencing wage rates, it is not the only factor. Foreign capital investment will also positively impact domestic wage rates and our economy. After repeal of the income tax, the U.S. will be perhaps the most attractive place on earth to invest. The U.S. will attract investment capital from around the world that will finance new plants and create jobs here in America. U.S. workers will build these plants, much of the equipment installed in the plants will be American made, and American workers will be employed in these plants to produce goods for both domestic and foreign markets. \n \n Additionally, expatriated U.S. investment dollars can also be expected to find their way home. In all, during the 1980's when marginal tax rates were reduced in the U.S. from a top rate of 70 percent down to 28 percent, the U.S. attracted a net capital inflow of roughly one-half trillion dollars. (See, \"The ABCs of the Capital Gains Tax,\" Stephen Moore and John Silvia, October 4, 1995, the Cato Institute, pp. 16-17.) \n \n Given the proposed tax treatment, strong infrastructure, political stability, relatively sound legal institutions, large domestic market and educated workforce in the U.S., investment in the U.S. will be singularly attractive-to the benefit of U.S. industry, U.S. workers and U.S. consumers.\n \n \n Don\n www.fairtax.org",

EVERYONE receives the rebates. In other words, the FairTax treats EVERYONE EQUALLY by expecting that everyone will spend at least an amount equal to the poverty level for necessities. The tax paid on that money is simply being returned. That is NOT redistribution of wealth!\n \n \n Don\n www.fairtax.org",
