   "What kinds of marriage do these quotes describe:\n interracial or same-sex couples?\n \n \n Quote \n 1)This type of legal marriage must be forbidden, said the Republican senator from Wisconsin, \"simply because natural instinct revolts at it as wrong.\" \n \n \n 2)An organization opposed to this type of marriage claimed that legalizing it would result in \"a degraded and ignoble population incapable of moral and intellectual development.\" \n \n 3)\"I believe that the tendency to classify all persons who oppose XXXX marriage as 'prejudiced' is in itself a prejudice,\" claimed a noted psychologist. \n \n 4)A U.S. representative from Georgia declared that allowing this type of marriage \"necessarily involves (the) degradation\" of conventional marriage, an institution that \"deserves admiration rather than execration.\" \n 5)\"The next step will be (the demand for) a law allowing them, without restraint, to ... have free and unrestrained social intercourse with your unmarried sons and daughters,\" warned a Kentucky congressman. \"It is bound to come to that. There is no disguising the fact. And the sooner the alarm is given and the people take heed, the better it will be for our civilization.\" \n \n 6)\"When people (like this) marry, they cannot possibly have any progeny,\" wrote an appeals judge in a Missouri case. \"And such a fact sufficiently justifies those laws which forbid their marriages.\" \n \n 7)These types of marriages are \"abominable,\" according to Virginia law. If allowed, they would \"pollute\" America. \n 8)In denying the appeal of this type of couple that had tried unsuccessfully to marry, a Georgia court wrote that such unions are \"not only unnatural, but ... always productive of deplorable results,\" such as increased effeminate behavior in the population. \"They are productive of evil, and evil only, without any corresponding good ... (in accordance with) the God of nature.\" \n 9)A ban on this type of marriage is not discriminatory, reasoned a Republican congressman from Illinois, because it \"applies equally to men and women.\" \n \n 10)Attorneys for the state of Tennessee argued that such unions should be illegal because they are \"distasteful to our people and unfit to produce the human race.\" The state Supreme Court agreed, declaring these types of marriages would be \"a calamity full of the saddest and gloomiest portent to the generations that are to come after us.\" \n \n 11)Lawyers for California insisted that a ban on this type of marriage is necessary to prevent \"traditional marriage from being contaminated by the recognition of relationships that are physically and mentally inferior,\" and entered into by \"the dregs of society.\" \n \n 12)\"The law concerning marriages is to be construed and understood in relation to those persons only to whom that law relates,\" thundered a Virginia judge in response to a challenge to that state's non-recognition of these types of unions. \"And not,\" he continued, \"to a class of persons clearly not within the idea of the legislature when contemplating the subject of marriage.\" \n \n \n How to Destroy Civilization as We Know It \n (And other light classics) \n For the authors of the above statements, it would seem that legal recognition of such marriages would offend tradition, God, the sensibilities of the majority, and the natural order. All the while threatening conventional marriage, children, and the future of our civilization. Plus, they indicate a profound sense of rage, fear, and righteous indignation. \n All of these quotes refer to interracial marriage, views of race, and the \"proper\" interaction between the races. They date from 1823-1964 and were culled by reporter Eric Zorn from a Boston University Law Review article and a brief filed with the U.S. Supreme Court. Zorn's article was published in the Chicago Tribune, May 19, 1996. \n \n Interracial Marriage  \n The original quote about not being able to produce progeny articulated the old, white-supremacist belief that the offspring of whites and blacks were sterile, just like mules that result when horses and donkeys mate. \n It is chilling to know that 15 states still criminalized interracial marriage as recently as 1967, when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned those laws in Loving v. Virginia. \n In the present day, some right-wing extremists claim that marriage should be denied because same-sex couples cannot produce children. However, many same-sex couples have children from previous relationship, as well as through insemination, surrogacy, or adoption, etc. \n Still these same extremists wouldn't think of denying a license to opposite-sex couples who cannot, or don't want to, reproduce. \n \n Marrying Cousins \n Like interracial marriage law, the closeness of kin one could legally marry has changed through the centuries. \n In 1076, Pope Alexander II issued a decree prohibiting marriages between couples who were more closely related than 6th cousins. \n First cousin marriage is allowed in Vermont. The Alaska and Arizona marriage codes specifically prohibit marriage to a first cousin. \n Because legal marriage has taken a wide variety of forms over the centuries, the only constant has been change. As these laws evolve to suit the times and public sentiments, it is clear that some people are loath to allow the changes to take place, whether the changes are regarding kinship, interracial marriage, or same-sex marriage.\n \n (The above quiz is available on the following web site) \n http://www.buddybuddy.com/quiz-1.html",

And a miss. Strike One. My words include the phrase 'genetic capacity.' That is true to the definition of 'sex,' which includes the phrase ' sum of the structural, functional, and behavioral characteristics of living things.'

What man makes is a far cry from what nature brings into being. For example: We take gold and silver from the earth. It was put there by the forces of mother nature.

   "Hi Maxwell and Justine:\n Swing! And a miss. Strike One. My words include the phrase 'genetic capacity.'\n\n \n Genetically they cannot do it with the ability do to so. Bob has the genetic ability to reproduce, but he's been castrated. Does that mean he can physicsally do so without cloning? No. \n \n \nEveryone is born with the genetic capability. Whether that translates into functionality or not means nothing regarding whether they are male or female.\n\n \n You apparently still think that sex is only about reproduction. Something tells me you haven't hit puberty yet. \n \n \n\n Swing and a miss. Strike two. \"Nature,\" above means what might happen in the back seat of a Chevy. You are trying to say that whatever you create is part of our natural environment.\n\n \n Technically yes. We are technically nature. Everything occurs in nature. Therefore, anything we do is technically natural. \n \n \n\n The term 'nature' means a lot of things without the use of an adjective, and I agree that my use of the term above could have been better described.\n\n \n Will you drop the sementics and argue at a sub superficial level? You apparently can only talk about what the definiton of sex is. Arguing primarily about semantics is a weak style those who cannot properly understand the basics of debate use. \n \n \nMother nature brings things into being by what we perceive as supernatural powers and causes. Those things are still part of the environment and 'nature.' What man makes is a far cry from what nature brings into being.\n\n \n That does not necessarily make it not natural. We are all technically star dust, and everything we make is from stardust. What we make is still part of the enviroment. \n \n \nFor example: We take gold and silver from the earth. It was put there by the forces of mother nature. Try and create yourself some gold out of thin air.\n\n \n Give me a particle accelerator, a few million dollars and a once of platnium and I can do it, no problem. \n \n \nAnd 'everything we do is part of nature?' Heh. Since when did actions become part of nature? But, you are leading up to the Frankenstein Scenario. So go right ahead . . . \n\n \n Are you saying no actions were part of nature? That nature's actions were not part of herself? \n \n \n\n Swing! And a miss. Strike Three. The resulting offspring would still be a heterosexual male or a heterosexual female.\n\n \n Possibly. Or they might have the genes and chemistry to be a homosexual. You seem to think that sex is devoid of actual conscience thought. \n \n \nWhatever monsters you create in a laboratory will never change the definition of life, at it pertains to human beings as a species. \n\n \n That's the same argument aganist invitro and artificial insemnation. \n \n \n\n Gene splicing the dna of two males and inserting that into the female egg, and implanting that inside a woman? Are you serious? Name the dude, Frank; definitely Frank.\n\n \n We can do it with animals. Heck, it's not that hard. Dolly was simply the replacement of a donor cell with new DNA. Remove the DNA, replace it with a fused, properly regulated human egg, give it a volt of energy, and bam, you have a embryo. That's the basics, but you get the idea.",
