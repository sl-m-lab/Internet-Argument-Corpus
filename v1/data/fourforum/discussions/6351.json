   "Marx, Darwin and the Scientific Ideology\n \n by John Thornton Bannerman\n \n WHEN IN 1867 Karl Marx had completed the first volume of his major work, Das Kapital, he offered to dedicate it to the great biologist Charles Darwin. Darwin cautiously declined the honour, pleading his \"ignorance of economics.\"\n \n No less ironic were the words spoken sixteen years later at Marx's graveside by his amanuensis and financial backer, Friedrich Engels. \"Just as Darwin discovered the law of evolution in organic nature,\" eulogised Engels, \"so Marx discovered the law of evolution in human history.\" Ironic, for the social consequences of the law of evolution in organic nature Darwin discovered sounded the death-knell of Marx's pretended \"law of evolution in human history.\"\n \n The invocation of Darwin's name by Marx and Engels cannot have reflected any grasp on their part of the social implications of his discoveries...implications which are in fact utterly fatal to the Marxist worldview. Instead, Marx and Engels trotted out the name of Darwin as part of their ambition to present as \"new\" and \"scientific\" a body of belief which actually is very old and wholly unscientific.\n \n Full article:\n \n http://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=3778\n \n \n \n .",

I tried to read the article, but it was so full of posturing and drivell that I couldn`t force myself to read it all.\n \n I also wonder why you claim to be german when you are obviously not... But since you`ve not answered that question before, I have little hopes that you will do it this time...",

   "The first part of the article is interesting, in the way it casts Marx's vision of history as parallel to the judeo-christian fall and redemption of man, I've read similar sort of stuff before, \"There is no God, and Marx is his prophet\", sort of thing, and you can see the links.\n \n The attempt to justify National-Socialism on the basis of evolutionary theory however is very weak, and the author knows it, so all we get are vague innuendos about racial differences, and how society must take into account nationalism, etc. None of which really leads to the conclusion the author wants.\n \n Finally, we have this gem, which really explains the whole piece\n \nIn contrast, those of us who uphold Marxism's only serious intellectual rival, hereditarian Racial-Nationalism \n\n \n Racial-Nationalism is the only serious intellectual rival of marxism in the quest for worst political philosophy of all time. Neither have good philosophical justification, nor have popular appeal today, nor are ideological factors in modern politics in the western world.\n \n What this statement actually says is this; we cannot justify racial-nationalism, so we will instead criticise the weakest school of political philosophy that we can find, marxism, and declare that since it is wrong, we therefore are correct.\n \n In summary, watching a Nazi debate a Communist is like watching a homeless guy fight a drunk, the winner declaring they have defeated their \"only martial rival\".",
