   "That's a quarter of a MILLION PEOPLE dead from a single catastrophy.\n \n http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=topNews&storyID=7370905\n \n By Jerry Norton and Dean Yates \n BANDA ACEH, Indonesia (Reuters) - The global death toll from the Asian tsunami shot above 226,000 Wednesday after Indonesia's Health Ministry confirmed the deaths of tens of thousands of people previously listed as missing. \n \n The ministry raised the country's death toll to 166,320. It had previously given a figure of 95,450 while Indonesia's Ministry of Social Affairs had put the death toll at around 115,000 before it stopped counting. \n \n Dodi Indrasanto, a director at the health ministry's department of health affairs, said the new death total reflected the latest reports from the provinces of Aceh and North Sumatra, which were directly in the path of the killer tsunami spawned by a magnitude 9 earthquake the day after Christmas. \n \n The new figure lifted the total global death toll from the tsunami disaster to 226,566, although the number continues to rise as more deaths are reported around the region. \n \n *****************************************\n \n This disaster has evoked more charity and foriegn aid than the killing of over 925,000 people in Rwanda.\n \n Here's a death toll site...really makes one wonder how we've managed to stave off extinction of the human animal.\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_toll",
