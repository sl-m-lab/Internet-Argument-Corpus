   "The US, and to a greater or lesser degree much of the rest of the world, is concerned about Iran's enrichment of uranium. Iran says it's for nuclear power, the US says it's for a bomb. Shouldn't this be easy to verify one way or the other? Nuclear fuel needs to be enriched to about 3.5%, bombs require 80-90 %. The process requires a major industiral effort; it would be impossible to hide. It's also a slow process; it takes weeks or months to go from 3.5% to 90%. Surely if Iran were to try to make a bomb even the most casual inspection would detect it, right? Why is the US so dead set against allowing Iran to do any enriching, which they are legal permitted to do, instead of insisting on a rigorous inspection regime, which I believe Iran legally must allow?",

Oil is Iran's \"cash crop\". It's what they export to get international currencies. Every bit of oil they burn is less money they take in. I don't pretend to understand international monetary and fuel markets, but it seems quite plausible to me that exporting oil and importing uranium may make the most economic sense for Iran.\n \n The point, though, is that we don't need to rub our chins and go \"Hmmm, that's suspicious.\" If they are planning to enrich uranium for a bomb, we'll be able to tell long before they have enough for us to worry about. A simple inspection regime can ensure that no uranium gets enriched past what's needed for a reactor. We should be demanding that they allow inspections, instead of trying to prevent them from doing something which is within their rights.",

Bush is demanding that they halt enrichment, not that they allow inspections. Granted, he may be taking a hard line now with the intention of scaling back to just demanding inspections in the future. However, while acknowledging that possiblity, nothing in Bush's record would make me assume that's his intention. Up to this point he's demonstrated the diplomatic subtlety of a brick. If he's drawn the line at enrichment, I don't see him shifting it. If someone in the Bush administration has been pushing inspections, then please share a link.",

My point is this. Iran cannot enrich enough uranium to make a bomb without everyone knowing months if not a year ahead of time. As soon as they cross the 5-10% threshold we'll know, for a fact, that they aren't just making fuel, and we can bomb the heck out of them then. Why are we working outselves into a tizzy now? We're concerned; great, that's prudent. So how about we keep an eye on them, and wait for them to actually do something wrong before we start puffing up our chests? The window between us knowing, for a fact, that they're trying to build a bomb and their actually having the material to do so would be huge. They do, technically, have a right to persue nuclear power. So let's let them pursue that right, keep an eye on them, and wait for them to actually do something wrong before we start rattling sabers. It's not like they can go from 0 to bomb so quickly that we can't easily stop them. Let Iran rant all they want if it makes them feel better; they can't actually do anything quickly enough that we can't stop it.",
