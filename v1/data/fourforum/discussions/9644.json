   "I understand the family of elementary particles consists of matter particles and force particles. The matter particles are divided into leptons and quarks. Leptons do not interact through the strong force. Quarks interact through all the fundamental forces.\n \n The force particles carry the fundamental forces of nature - i.e. the strong force between quarks; the electromagnetic force; the weak force associated with radioactivity; and gravitational force. Fundamental particles have been conceived as points (or waves?) which do not have any internal structure, so they cannot be broken down into more elemental quanta. All this is \"easy\" to get a superficial handle on - though I don't mind being corrected if I've got it wrong. \n \n What I should like to know is whether string theory, which envisages the elementary particles (both matter and force) as tiny loops of vibrating energy with multiple dimensions, describes \"ultimate reality\" with more explanatory power than sticking with familiar point particles and waves. \n \n Is the strings hypothesis just an exercise in mathematical reasoning, or is there a basic level of physics at which every particle and force in the universe can be unified by a string theory?

If we knew the shape of those other dimension then we could explain why force and particles have the characteristics they do, among other things. Unfortunately, we don't have the math to even write the equations to describe the other dimensions, let alone solve the equations. At this point all we can do is hypothesize about what the equations might look like, and describe conditions they would have to meet to give rise to the universe we live in.

   "Sorry it's taken me a while to get around to answering (or trying to!) your question, James, but I've been busy with uni work and this subject is quite simply mind-boggling.\n \n As I understand it, the benefits of string theory come from its ability to potentially simplify or unify previous theories, and the problems stem from the predictions it makes about what we should observe in the universe. However, string theory should not be viewed in any way as a complete theory. It is more a new way of looking at patricle physics, which may yield new theories which completely supplant it, but which would have been impossible without it.\n \n Conventional theory describes the fundamental particles as 'dots' with no spatial extent, no dimensions. String theory contends that each particle is actually a tiny vibrating filament of energy which has no thickness, only length, ie a one-dimensional entity. \n Strings can vibrate in different patterns, and these different vibrational patterns correspond to different kinds of particles. So string theory attempts to simplify the standard model, by replacing the families of fundamental particles and their multiple properties with a single entity with a single variable property.\n \n The most important theoretical aspect of string theory is that there is a vibrational pattern that corresponds to the properties that a graviton is expected to have, hence the theory has the potential to unify all four physical forces; to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity. \n The theory does this by stipulating a minimum scale at which it is meaningful to observe or analyse any kind of interaction. At ultramicroscopic scales, the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics ensures that the smoothness of spacetime (the model which underlies general relativity) is destroyed. \n \n Below the Planck length (10^-33 cm) we see larger and larger quantum fluctuations in the gravitational field, the field which dictates the shape of spacetime. At scales much smaller than this, spacetime is a totally chaotic jumble. This is the core of the irreconcilability of the two theories. General relativity breaks down below the Planck length.\n \n Of course, at and above the Planck length, the gravitational field is still subject to fluctuations, but they are small enough to avoid conflicting with general relativity. The key factor in string theory is that the strings are calculated to be equal to or ever so slightly greater than the Planck length - nothing in the universe is smaller than this. So by limiting how small you can get, string theory limits how extreme quantum gravity fluctuations can ever be, which allows general relativity to function in the quantum domain. \n \n Of course, the natural, intuitive response to this is to resort to the conventional (and intuitive) notion that spacetime is continuous - that you can always divide a distance or a duration in half again and again, forever. \n In terms of convention, having zero-sized particles obviously implies that you can do this, but having a definitive smallest constituent of the universe renders anything smaller the Planck length (length of a string) meaningless, and it is meaningless to theorise an event which takes place in less time than the Planck time (amount of time it takes light to travel the length of a string).\n \n In terms of intuition, all I can say is that the two ground-breaking, empirically verified theories of the modern age, relativity and quantum mechanics, fly quite happily in the face of human reason. As many prominent scientists have admitted, while we can describe the workings of the universe in impressive detail, it still makes no sense!\n \n The main problems with string theory are that gravitons still have not been observed anywhere, and the problem of the hidden dimensions. Strings are 1 dimensional, but they are also 'curled up' in loops along equally 'curled up' dimensions that also have not been remotely verified. I have yet to look into the more recent claims that string theory has been rendered obsolete, but I somehow suspect that such claims would be based more on new theories that have built upon string theory rather than absolute refutations.\n \n Additionally, I am reminded of some of the bizarre predictions made by general relativity and quantum mechanics, such as gravitational lensing, time dilation, \n superposition and entanglement, which were purely mathematically theoretical at the time but were observed in reality when technology and experimentation caught up.\n \n OK my brain has suffered a total systems failure at this point, but I look forward to any questions or corrections.",

   "Sorry it's taken me a while to get around to answering (or trying to!) your question, James, but I've been busy with uni work and this subject is quite simply mind-boggling.\n\n Liminus : this is an impressive effort - you're miles ahead of me. I must admit that string theory stretches my comprehension to its limits. \n \nThe most important theoretical aspect of string theory is that there is a vibrational pattern that corresponds to the properties that a graviton is expected to have, hence the theory has the potential to unify all four physical forces; to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity.\n \n I understand that general relativity, which explains the large-scale structure of the universe, is incompatible with quantum mechanics which explains the nature of the subatomic world. This looks like a fundamental paradox; and physicists could not believe that Nature would allow it. So string theory comes to the rescue by finding a way to reconcile this incompatibility.\n \n But I still cannot really understand how. If these \"strings\" produce all known forces and particles in the universe, thus reconciling Einstein's theory of general relativity (the macro) with quantum mechanics (the micro), is it because an ingenious mathematical expedient has been found that puts a finite limit on quantities that otherwise could become either zero or infinite? Such a finite limit suggests that an irreducible quantum of length is introduced by string theory. In other words, the string theorists have conceived a hypothetical addition to the constants of nature side by side with the speed of light, Planck's constant, etc. \n \nThe main problems with string theory are that gravitons still have not been observed anywhere, and the problem of the hidden dimensions. Strings are 1 dimensional, but they are also 'curled up' in loops along equally 'curled up' dimensions that also have not been remotely verified. \n\n The curled up hidden dimensions of strings is another idea which is difficult if not impossible to visualize. I will not ask for the mathematical reasoning, which I could never understand, that supports this argument. But if the enormously hot \"spatial speck\" that describes the initial condition of the universe included these extra hidden dimensions, could it suggest that there was a prehistory to the universe - i.e. a period before the Big Bang?\n \n \nI have yet to look into the more recent claims that string theory has been rendered obsolete, but I somehow suspect that such claims would be based more on new theories that have built upon string theory rather than absolute refutations.\n \n Additionally, I am reminded of some of the bizarre predictions made by general relativity and quantum mechanics, such as gravitational lensing, time dilation, superposition and entanglement, which were purely mathematically theoretical at the time but were observed in reality when technology and experimentation caught up.\n\n You make an important point here. It would be premature to dismiss string theory. The fact that observation and experiment haven't yet confirmed the predictions of the strings hypothesis, might not be a good reason to abandon it. Nature is probably a lot more bizarre than we bargained for. \n \n \nOK my brain has suffered a total systems failure at this point, but I look forward to any questions or corrections.\n\n No corrections (at least from me).

If these \"strings\" produce all known forces and particles in the universe, thus reconciling Einstein's theory of general relativity (the macro) with quantum mechanics (the micro), is it because an ingenious mathematical expedient has been found that puts a finite limit on quantities that otherwise could become either zero or infinite?\n\n \n Essentially you have hit the nail on the head, perhaps without even knowing it; outside of string theory, combining the equations of relativity with the equations of quantum mechanics always yields a resultant infinity; as you probably know, this means nothing more than that the result of combining the two equations is meaningless; an infinite answer simply tells us that we are going wrong somewhere. \n String theory essentially bypasses this problem by giving us new parameters within which to work; parameters which limit us to results that make sense. I hope my 'explanation' below highlights why and how this is important.\n \n \nSuch a finite limit suggests that an irreducible quantum of length is introduced by string theory. In other words, the string theorists have conceived a hypothetical addition to the constants of nature side by side with the speed of light, Planck's constant, etc. \n\n \n Indeed, an \"irreducible quantum of length\" (or any other dimension, including time) is introduced by string theory. There are a couple of important points to make here:\n \n 1) The nature of irreducibility: If we take string theory as gospel, we have a stipulated minimum dimensional quantum. The major conceptual problem when considering string theory is that if we can identify such an object as a string, then without doubt in our minds we can certainly imagine 'half a string', and half again, and again, and so on. This is the continuity problem. However, while we can imagine such concepts, if the smallest constituent of existence really is a string, then it is literally pointless for us to ever consider any interaction that may happen below this scale, as by definition it cannot exist. This may sound circular, but given some consideration does actually make sense; the problem (as with much of modern physics) only exists within our minds; it is natural to assume that we can continuously divide such quanta, but if we accept that we cannot, we are left with a new picture of the universe. Irreducibility in terms of the human mind versus observed reality (the continuity problem) is a whole other philosophical problem, one which has both stymied and informed physical theory in equal amounts!\n \n 2)This new 'dimensional quantum' (this is my term by the way) introduced by string theory should not be thought of as a physical constant. This may be nitpicking on my part, but while string theory gives us minimum scales at which to work, these scales serve very different conceptual and mathematical functions than do the fundamental constants; there is nothing wrong with conceptually conflating these ideas as basic cosmological/physical elements, but if a complete understanding is the goal, it is best to conceptually separate the two into 'fundamental constants' and 'minimum dimensional quanta'.\n \n \nThe curled up hidden dimensions of strings is another idea which is difficult if not impossible to visualize. I will not ask for the mathematical reasoning, which I could never understand, that supports this argument. But if the enormously hot \"spatial speck\" that describes the initial condition of the universe included these extra hidden dimensions, could it suggest that there was a prehistory to the universe - i.e. a period before the Big Bang?\n\n \n Don't bloody worry, the maths of extradimensional physics is several years beyond me; as I said, this is an area which I am only poorly familiar with! In answer to your question, given what I know, the fact that these extra dimensions may exist offers no insight whatsoever into pre-Big Bang conditions. The only thing I've ever read that is relevant to what you ask suggested that maybe all ten/eleven (who knows!?) spatial dimensions may have been equal at the moment of the Big Bang, but the extra ones became 'curled up' as a result of it. This however does not even speculate into pre Tzero conditions, and unless most of current theory is overturned, we can never in principle know anything that occured before Tzero.\n \n That's pretty much all I've got at the moment. I can say that the major theory at the moment is known as 'M-theory' which combines the 5 conflicting , pre-existing forms of string theory in much the same way as a language professor would decode a foreign language from 5 languages which shared characteristics with the mystery language, but none of which solved the puzzle on its own. \n \n As an additional addendum: I very much doubt that there are more than a handful of people on the plant who really understand these theories and their implications; as I've said before, we have plenty of ideas but these ideas are so far ahead of our time that we the technology we need to test them takes years of work and billions of dollars to build.

And if we take string theory as gospel, it seems the best explanation available.

Of course, for these people, 'personal understanding' may take a different form than it does for me: I want answers, and I want them now!\n \n That said, however, I came to realise that the anthropic principle does provide a genuinely rational answer. The part of your quote that I have emphasised is a question followed by its own answer. Of course we exist in a universe which posseses the 'correct' combination of fundamental constants that allow life to come into existence. It could be no other way. I see nothing supernatural in this conclusion whatsoever. On the contrary, I see the anthropic principle as a counter-argument to the theistic argument from design.\n \n In terms of the further implications of the anthropic principle, there is a school of physicists who expect to find that as we understand more and more about the very early universe, we will find that the fundamental constants are interrelated, or depenedent on some other as yet unknown quantity, in such a way as to be 'destined' to be 'set' at the values that they have; that the physical processes of the Big Bang and inflation can only give rise to such a combination; that there is only one way for a universe to be. (I have no idea how much of this is theory and how much is hypothesis).\n \n One example is the strong force which binds protons and neutrons together in atmoic nuclei, and governs the production of new elements through nuclear fusion. If the strong force were the tiniest bit weaker, fusion would not occur and the universe would be nothing but hydrogen. The tiniest bit stronger, and all the hydrogen would have fused into heavier elements before the earth was even formed. In either scenario, life could not exist. \n \n Because our study of the very early universe is still in its infancy, we have absolutely no idea why any of the constants have the values they do; none whatsoever. The key question is, would the universe even exist at all if the constants were any different? We have so little concrete knowledge of the dynamics of the very early universe that we cannot theorise what difference it would make in those crucial first few seconds; it could well be that changing any of the constants precludes certain key events such as inflation or nucleosynthesis from taking place. Nobody knows. Worse still (as far as I know) nobody even knows how to know at the moment!",
