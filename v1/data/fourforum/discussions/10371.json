Yet although these ears may differ in some details, they all share certain features: an eardrumlike membrane to capture sound vibrations and small bones--such as the stapes--to transmit the sounds to the inner ear. Based on the fossil record, the earliest known ears of this type date to 200 million years ago or later.\n",

   "Evolution of copy number of amylase gene in humans due to selection by diets.\n \n \n \nScience 14 September 2007:\n Vol. 317. no. 5844, p. 1483\n DOI: 10.1126/science.317.5844.1483a\n \n Prev | Table of Contents | Next\n News of the Week\n GENOMICS:\n A Little Gene Xeroxing Goes a Long Way\n Jon Cohen\n \n Figure 1 Extra enzymes. Hadza diet drives gene copying.\n \n CREDIT: F. MARLOWE/FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY\n \n Researchers studying the evolution of starch digestion have uncovered evidence of a surprising adaptation: Rather than relying on mutations in a particular gene to help us digest roots and tubers better, the human genome simply made more copies of the gene in question. The finding is one of the strongest examples yet of evolution affecting gene copy number in humans and sheds light on how our diet split us apart from other primates.\n \n An enzyme called salivary amylase--encoded by the AMY1 gene--helps humans digest starchy food. In a typical evolutionary scenario, natural selection would favor random mutations in AMY1 that caused it to churn out more of the enzyme or a more effective version of it in people who ate a high-starch diet.\n \n But a study published online 9 September in Nature Genetics contends that something else happened. Nathaniel Dominy, an evolutionary anthropologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and George Perry at Arizona State University in Tempe analyzed AMY1 in high-starch eaters such as Americans of European descent, Japanese, and Hadza from Tanzania, hunter-gatherers who eat many roots and tubers, as well as groups that eat little starch, such as the Biaka of the Central African Republic and the Mbuti from Congo, both rainforest hunter-gatherers, and Tanzania's Datog and Siberia's Yakut pastoralists. In all, the researchers studied samples from more than 200 people.\n \n The team found that rather than having mutations that boosted AMY1's activity, the high-starch eaters had extra copies of the gene. On average, the high-starch eaters had seven copies of the gene, whereas the low-starch populations had only five. \"If you have a gene that's working well, why not just copy it over and over again?\" asks Dominy. \"Why wait for evolution to just roll the dice?\"\n \n For a broader evolutionary perspective, the researchers looked at 15 chimpanzees, which eat little starch. All had only two copies of AMY1. And an analysis of the gene from bonobos, the chimp's closest relative, found that it had mutations that may prevent AMY1 from functioning altogether. \"I was very excited to see this,\" says Gregory Laden, a biological anthropologist at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, who contends that eating starch-rich roots and tubers played a key role in differentiating humans from other apes.\n \n Ajit Varki, who studies human origins at the University of California, San Diego, says the report also suggests that humans may have had access to starchy foods before the advent of agriculture, as is commonly thought. Even populations with low-starch diets had extra AMY1 copies, he notes: \"This would imply that first there were some rounds of duplication of the gene in preagricultural humans, and then that went further in agricultural humans.\"\n",

Lets vote\" No vitalism is involved no intelligence those with more copies of AMY1 simply survived and reproduced somewhat better than those with fewer copies - in environments were more starch was present in the diets.

The best understood example is the methylation of cytosine bases in DNA, which acts to silence transposable elements and requires the maintenance DNA methyltransferase DNMT1. Bostick et al. (p. 1760, published online 2 August) show that a member of a recently discovered family of methyl DNA binding proteins, UHRF1 (ubiquitin-like, containing PHD and RING finger domains 1) is also critical for the maintenance of CpG DNA methylation in mammals. UHRF1 binds hemimethylated DNA, interacts and colocalizes with DNMT1, and is required for the stable association of DNMT1 with chromatin. These findings suggest that UHRF1 recruits DNMT1 to facilitate efficient maintenance CpG methylation.\n",

   "Here is an interesting bit of news. A possible link between specific variants of glutamate receptors (governed by genes) and suicide when under treatment with certain antidepressants.\n \n \n \n \nSource: NIH, National Institute of Mental Health\n Date: September 27, 2007\n More on: \n Mental Health Research, Genes, Depression, Mental Health, Psychiatry, Diseases and Conditions\n Genes Linked To Suicidal Thinking During Antidepressant Treatment\n \n Science Daily - Specific variations in two genes are linked to suicidal thinking that sometimes occurs in people taking the most commonly prescribed class of antidepressants, according to a large study led by scientists at the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH).\n NaN\n \n Depending on the particular mix inherited, these versions increased the likelihood of such thoughts from 2- to15-fold, the study found. About 1 percent of adult patients were deemed to be at high genetic risk, 41 percent at elevated risk and 58 percent at lower risk.\n \n If confirmed, the findings may hold promise for genetic testing, as more such markers are identified.\n \n Risk increased proportionately if a participant had two, as opposed to just one of the suspect versions. Both genes code for components of the brain's glutamate chemical messenger system, which recent studies suggest is involved in the antidepressant response.\n \n Overall, about 6 percent of 1,915 patients with depression reported that they started to have suicidal thoughts while taking an antidepressant. This rate soared to 36 percent among the few patients with both of the suspect gene versions; 59 percent of the patients who had suicidal thoughts had at least one of the versions.\n \n Francis J. McMahon, M.D., Gonzalo Laje, M.D., NIMH Mood and Anxiety Disorders Program, and colleagues at the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Mount Sinai School of Medicine, and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, report on their findings in the October, 2007 issue of The American Journal of Psychiatry.\n \n \"These data suggest that genetics may soon help us in our quest to individualize treatments for depression,\" said NIMH Director Thomas R. Insel, M.D.\n \n \"In the future, we hope that genetic testing will help doctors identify those few patients who are at high risk for suicidal thinking during antidepressant therapy and need close monitoring or alternative treatments,\" said McMahon. \"This should help allay concerns for the vast majority of patients. The best way to prevent suicide is to treat depression.\"\n \n In the most comprehensive study of its kind to date, McMahon and colleagues screened genetic material from 1,915 adult participants with major depression in level one of the NIMH-funded STAR*D (Sequenced Treatment Alternatives for Depression) trial. Study participants were treated with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram. The researchers looked for associations between self-reports of suicidal thinking and more than 700 sites in 68 suspect genes where letters in the genetic code vary across individuals, creating different versions of the same gene.\n \n The researchers found that certain versions of two genes that code for glutamate receptors -- the receiving stations for the neurotransmitter's chemical messages -- were more prevalent in patients with suicidal thinking. How the newly identified versions affect the workings of glutamate receptors to confer increased risk remains to be discovered. It's also not yet known whether the findings generalize to other antidepressants.\n \n One percent of the study participants had a version of the kainate receptor gene, GRIK2, that increased the odds for suicidal thinking more than 8-fold. Forty-one percent of participants had a version of the AMPA receptor gene, GRIA3, that raised the odds nearly 2-fold. About one-half of 1 percent of participants had both high risk gene versions, boosting the odds 15 fold -- but this was the case for only 11 participants, of whom four developed suicidal thinking.\n \n Neither version was related to self-reported history of suicide attempts. This suggests that the versions are specific to suicidal thoughts that occur during antidepressant treatment, rather than the much more common suicidal thoughts and behavior that occur outside of the treatment setting.\n \n More than 40 percent of those who developed suicidal thoughts lacked either of the two versions, indicating that other genes and environmental factors were also likely involved. But the potential value of predictive testing is increasing as more genes are analyzed. McMahon's group will report at a genetics conference in October on identification of additional versions that emerged from a scan of the whole genome in STAR*D patients. In July, NIMH funded researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital reported an association between variations in the CREB1 gene and treatment-emergent suicidal thinking among men in the STAR*D sample.\n \n Earlier studies had shown that about 4 percent of youth treated with antidepressants experience suicidal thinking compared with about 2 percent of those taking placebos.\n \n The resultant climate of concern culminated in the 2004 Food and Drug Administration decision requiring that antidepressants carry a black box warning about risk of suicidal thinking for children and adolescents -- and later proposing that it be extended to young adults up to age 24. In 2004, the Centers for Disease Control recorded the largest spike in youth suicide rates in 15 years. NIMH-funded researchers recently suggested that this may have been related to a drop in antidepressant prescriptions for youth.\n \n By contrast, they note that suicide rates reached a record low in 2004 for adults over 60, for whom antidepressant prescription rates continued to rise; this inverse relationship held with increasing age. A more definitive analysis must await release of 2005 U.S. suicide rate data later this year, researchers say.\n \n However, evidence suggests that neither suicidal thoughts, nor the high-risk gene versions, are necessarily related to actual suicide attempts, according to McMahon. Other studies have shown that the rate of such attempts is higher before antidepressant treatment begins -- and suicide attempts are not always preceded by suicidal thoughts. For example, in the current study, one of the two participants who actually attempted suicide carried high-risk versions, but denied experiencing suicidal thoughts.\n \n Even if suicidal thinking does not predict suicidal behavior, it is associated with a poorer response to antidepressant medication, the researchers say. Only 25 percent of patients with suicidal thinking fully recovered from their depression during the initial phase of the STAR*D trail, compared with 42 percent of patients not affected by such thoughts.\n \n McMahon and colleagues hope that the newly identified versions may prove useful in identifying patients who need closer monitoring, alternative treatments and/or specialty care -- while reassuring those for whom antidepressants are appropriate.\n \n Also participating in the research were: Drs. Silvia Paddock and Husseini Manji, NIMH; Dr. A.

   "Another interesting development. Hummm PJ Keeling? Peeling??????\n \n \nScience 28 September 2007:\n Vol. 317. no. 5846, pp. 1875 - 1876\n DOI: 10.1126/science.1149593\n \n Prev | Table of Contents | Next\n Perspectives\n GENOMICS:\n Deep Questions in the Tree of Life\n Patrick J. Keeling*\n \n A genome sequence might provide answers to major questions about the biology and evolutionary history of an organism. Alternatively, it might reveal more problems than solutions, and its true value then lies in identifying what questions to ask. Perhaps the most interesting genomes do both: They are a panacea and a Pandora's box. On page 1921 in this issue, Morrison et al. (1) describe such a genome from the diplomonad protist Giardia lamblia, a human intestinal parasite. The compact Giardia genome is replete with information ranging from the simplicity of its molecular systems to how the parasite interacts with its environment. However, the evolutionary history of Giardia is not so clearly written in the genome, reigniting a smoldering debate about the origin of Giardia and its relationship to other eukaryotes.\n \n The evolution of Giardia has commanded a level of attention matched by few other organisms because it differs from the \"textbook\" eukaryote in many ways. Most notably, there are no mitochondria in Giardia or its relatives, in keeping with its tolerance for low levels of oxygen (2). The absence of this organelle took on new significance with the Archezoa hypothesis, which proposed that Giardia (and certain other protists) diverged from other eukaryotes before the endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria, and was therefore ancient and primitively amitochondriate (3). Early molecular phylogenies supported this view, placing Giardia and other Archezoa at the base of eukaryotic evolution (4, 5). The case seemed closed: Giardia arose from the prokaryote-eukaryote transition, one of the greatest transformations in evolution.\n \n Figure 1 Eukaryotic evolution. The hypothetical evoultionary tree consists of five \"supergroups\" based on several kinds of evidence (15). The branching order of supergroups is unresolved, implying that the relationships are unknown rather than a simultaneous radiation. CM indicates the presence of cryptic mitochondria (hydrogenosomes or mitosomes). A question mark indicates that no organelle has yet been found.\n \n The Archezoa hypothesis proved too good to be true. Nuclear genes phylogenetically related to mitochondrial homologs were discovered in Archezoa, including Giardia (4, 5). The protein products of such genes have been localized to double membrane-bounded organelles (hydrogenosomes or mitosomes) in all major Archezoan groups, and similar structures were found in distantly related eukaryotes (see the figure). Some of these organelles and their metabolic activities are well characterized (e.g., Trichomonas hydrogenosomes), but the functions of other cryptic organelles remain elusive (e.g., Entamoeba mitosomes). In Giardia, proteins involved in iron-sulfur cluster assembly and protein folding appear closely related to mitochondrial homologs and localize to a relict mitosome (6, 7). Interestingly, the Giardia genome contains little else of identifiable mitochondrial ancestry: No other functions can be predicted and protein-import complexes are reduced or highly divergent (1, 8).\n \n The other implication of the Archezoa hypothesis--that Giardia is an early branching eukaryote--has attracted even more controversy. The \"deep\" position of some Archezoa has been convincingly undermined by showing that they belong elsewhere in the phylogenetic tree, the clearest case being the relationship between microsporidia and fungi (5). For Giardia, such a specific alternative is not so clear-cut, but the genome may provide clues. Diplomonads may belong to a group of protists known as excavates, specifically related to Parabasalia such as Trichomonas (9, 10). Like Trichomonas, the Giardia genome does not encode myosin (which is rarely absent from eukaryotic genomes) and encodes a bacterial arginine metabolism pathway, supporting a close relationship. This does not preclude an early divergence for both Giardia and parabasalids, for this depends on where the root of the eukaryotic tree lies, which is difficult to resolve. Indeed, there are doubts about how phylogenetic reconstruction methods can determine this root, given the unequal rates of sequence evolution and great genetic distance between eukaryotes and prokaryotes (11). There are also difficulties inherent in reconstructing the history of divergent genes with current phylogenetic methods, and large amounts of data that violate evolutionary models can generate well-supported errors (12). Morrison et al. show high levels of divergence in much of the Giardia genome, so although the genome may contain data to reconstruct Giardia's history, it will be a challenge to use it.\n \n The outcome of this debate affects not only our understanding of early eukaryotic evolution, but also our view of Giardia biology. Simple characteristics could be primitive or derived via reduction, alternatives with very different meanings. The simplicity of Giardia's molecular systems differs from that of known derived parasites (1, 13). However, different lineages can follow different reductive paths (14), so determining Giardia's origins independently of its simplicity is essential. Given the depth of these questions, the new life that Morrison et al. have breathed into the debates is welcome, and will ensure continued attention on both a fascinating cell and the origin of eukaryotes.\n \n References\n \n 1.

This clock comprises a multicellular genetic network of synchronized oscillators, coupled by intercellular Delta-Notch signaling. How this synchrony is established and how its loss determines the position of segmentation defects in Delta and Notch mutants are unknown. We analyzed the clock's synchrony dynamics by varying strength and timing of Notch coupling in zebra-fish embryos with techniques for quantitative perturbation of gene function. We developed a physical theory based on coupled phase oscillators explaining the observed onset and rescue of segmentation defects, the clock's robustness against developmental noise, and a critical point beyond which synchrony decays. We conclude that synchrony among these genetic oscillators can be established by simultaneous initiation and self-organization and that the segmentation defect position is determined by the difference between coupling strength and noise.\n \n Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics (MPI-CBG), Pfotenhauerstrasse 108, 01307 Dresden, Germany.\n \n * Present address: Division of Biology, California Institute of Technology, MC 139-74, Pasadena, CA 91125, USA.

   "Revelant to forces which drive evolutionary speciation.\n \n \n \nAdaptation to environmental conditions is believed to drive population divergence and hence demonstrates the predictability of evolutionary change. By investigating the morphology, genetic divergence, and mate choice of Bahamas mosquitofish, which live in isolated pools, Langerhans et al. demonstrate parallel speciation events among pools, in which the presence or absence of a fish predator appears to be driving speciation. In pools with strong predation, mosquitofish have evolved a morphology conducive to high-speed escape swimming. Haplotype and allozyme analyses show that these morphological changes in response to predation have occurred multiple times. As these fish prefer to mate with similar individuals, the presence or absence of a predator drives speciation through mate selection. Taken all together, this set of results shows a direct link between natural selection and speciation: The traits under divergent selection between environments are the same traits used in mate choice, resulting in reproductive isolation between populations inhabiting different environments. -- LMZ\n \n Evolution 61, 2056 (2007).\n",

   "And one more of interest to many here.\n \n \n \n \nScience 5 October 2007:\n Vol. 318. no. 5847, pp. 54 - 55\n DOI: 10.1126/science.1149597\n \n Prev | Table of Contents | Next\n Perspectives\n EVOLUTION:\n Feathers, Females, and Fathers\n Michael G. Ritchie*\n \n Alfred Wallace, Darwin's contemporary and rival, argued that when species hybridize, natural selection favors individuals who are more fussy about whom they mate with, which therefore increases female discrimination of males from different species (1). Modern evolutionary genetics has questioned the importance of the \"Wallace effect\" (also known as \"reinforcement\") because genetic recombination between female discrimination and male trait genes would scramble combinations of loci that favor speciation. Several solutions to this have been proposed, including close genetic linkage of such loci. A simpler possibility is sexual imprinting, which causes a female to prefer males that resemble her father. A study of flycatchers by S\u00e6ther et al. on page 95 of this issue (2) has taken advantage of natural hybridization that occurs between species of this bird, and demonstrates that female preference for father-like males is due to sex linkage of genes for female preferences rather than to sexual imprinting. The linkage of genes that influence speciation to sex chromosomes may turn out to be a common influence on the origin of species.\n \n The evolutionary biologist J. Felsenstein (3) famously argued that because of genetic recombination, there might be fewer species of animals than we expect. In other words, if sexual species hybridize, recombination jumbles up their genes such that independent sets of loci coding for hybrid unfitness, male sexual traits, and female preferences are unlikely to crystallize out into new species. Exceptions may occur if the genes are all tightly genetically linked on one chromosome. Felsenstein also recognized that a \"single-allele\" solution could facilitate speciation. In this case, allelic replacement at one locus simultaneously causes selective mating between individuals that are genetically related or have similar characteristics (known as assortative mating), but it was difficult to imagine the mechanism for this. Sexual imprinting is one possibility (4, 5); if a gene makes a female prefer males that are like her father, then the same allele could increase assortative mating between populations. It has been proposed that sexual imprinting may be involved in rapid speciation in the face of gene flow in birds (6) and fish, including the dramatic radiations of African cichlids (7).\n \n Unlike most animals, female birds are the heterogametic sex, having the equivalent of a human Y chromosome, called the W chromosome (so females are ZW, males ZZ). Collared and pied flycatchers meet and occasionally hybridize along a contact zone in central and northern Europe. Hybrid females are sterile but hybrid males are fertile, an example of \"Haldane's rule\" in that the heterogametic sex (having two different sex chromosomes) shows greater dysfunction. It also indicates that fertility dysfunction probably involves genes on the sex chromosomes. In these hybrid zones of contact, male sexual plumage differences are accentuated and hybridization levels reduced, providing evidence that the Wallace effect has occurred (8). What accounts for this? Female sexual imprinting on paternal traits such as plumage differences, or genetic linkage between preference and trait loc\ni?",

   "Now here is an interesting adaptation. The male plant is normally home to thrips, when the pollen is \"ripe\" the plant heats up volatilizing a \"perfume\" which REPELS the thrips so that they move to femal plants and pollinate them. Its apparently a very old association as the cyads are an ancient linage.\n \n \nLeading Pollinators by the Nose\n \n By Elizabeth Pennisi\n ScienceNOW Daily News\n 4 October 2007\n Women know that just the right amount of perfume can drive men wild, but too much can drive them away. Ancient plants called cycads take advantage of this age-old principle, too. By changing the amount of an odor they produce, the plants drive tiny pollinators called thrips out of male plants and attract them to the females.\n \n Plants tend to depend either on wind or on bees, birds, or other animals to carry pollen to female flowers, or in the case of pine trees and other gymnosperms, to female cones. Many species have evolved sophisticated chemical cues for attracting just the right pollinator. Botanists had thought that some cycads, which can look a lot like ferns or palms, depended on wind pollination. But behavioral ecologist L. Irene Terry of the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, suspected otherwise, as the cones' scales are too tightly layered to let the pollen blow in. In 1999, she discovered that the Australian cycads she studied were pollinated by thrips, 1- to 2-millimeter-long insects commonly found in flowers.\n \n Terry also noticed that the male cones often exuded a sharp odor reminiscent of turpentine. In 2004, she and her colleagues demonstrated that cones rev up their metabolism and heat up for a few hours midday, reaching 12 degrees Celsius above ambient temperature and, as a result, emitted much higher concentrations of the smelly stuff. The heating and \"take-your-breath-away\" odor coincided with a massive exodus of thrips, which otherwise spend their lives inside the cones of male plants, mating, laying eggs, growing, and feasting on pollen. In seeking out new cones, some thrips visited female plants, pollinating those cones. Terry and her colleagues wondered whether the insects left the male cones because they got hot or because they didn't like the smell.\n \n The incentive to pack up, they learned, is more smell than heat. To show that, the researchers put the bugs in Y-shaped tubes so that they could choose to go toward or away from a particular odor emitted into one arm of the Y. They found that the insects were attracted to low concentrations of the cycad cone odor but repelled by high concentrations, which actually proved toxic to the thrips. Female cones emit these low concentrations. Come afternoon at certain times of the year, thrips flee their usual digs in male cones and are subsequently lured to female cones, at least temporarily, Terry's group reports in the 5 October issue of Science.\n \n What's novel is that the plant repels pollinators to achieve its aims. \"That's not something that's been on the radar before,\" says Olle Pellmyr, an evolutionary ecologist at the University of Idaho in Moscow. Pellmyr says that a close look at other plant-pollinator relationships, such as that between wasps and figs, might reveal similar sorts of complex chemical manipulations.\n",
