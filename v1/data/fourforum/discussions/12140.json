   "-\n \n It is a commonly held belief in many parts of the world that the \n defects in American society stem from the fact that America was \n originally settled by people who were genetically defective. They \n say: look at those who first came: religious lunatics, criminals, \n indentured servants, people so brutal that they found slavery \n acceptable, and in general, large numbers of losers who could not \n make it back home.\n \n There is a certain plausibility in this argument, but I think it \n fails. In the nature-nurture debate, in general, the preponderance of \n evidence is on the side of nurture. After all, the only thing DNA \n codes for is the production of proteins. If a defect cannot be traced \n back to some variation in protein production, it almost certainly is \n not genetic in origin. No, my dear fellow Americans, our faults are \n not in our stars, but in ourselves.\n \n Then there is the cultural determinism argument: America was set on \n its course by the type of societies founded by the first settlers. In \n New England these were theocracies set up by groups of religious \n fanatics whose nearest counterpart in the modern world would be the \n Taliban in Afghanistan. In the South, there was a brutal and indolent \n ruling class of planters who found nothing wrong in human slavery. \n Certainly there was serious damage to the intellect and a coarsening \n of moral fiber among a people who for hundreds of years insisted that \n another group of people who were obviously human beings were not, in \n fact, human beings.\n \n Then there is the argument that civilized Europeans came to America \n to tame the wilderness, and the wilderness turned them into savages. \n There is, I think, some truth in this observation, but not as it is \n usually understood. People who bring up this line of thought will say \n that the British immigrants were under constant danger of Indian \n attack and slave uprisings and that this constant stress goes a long \n way toward explaining the tetchiness and incipient hysteria that has been \n noted for centuries as a strong aspect of the American character. It \n is also asserted that life was hard for the early settlers, and that \n this helps to explain the brutality of the people and the coarseness \n of their culture.\n \n Certainly there were dangers---attacks [usually self-provoked] were, \n from time to time, made upon the settlers by the indians. But these \n attacks, though tragic for individuals, did not, after the first few \n decades of settlement, seriously threaten the safety and integrity of \n the colonies. Furthermore, can one say that intermittent and minor \n attacks by the dispossessed native population were worse than what \n often faced Europeans on their own continent at the same period? \n Certainly living in the path of the invading armies of Louis XIV or \n the Duke of Marlborough was at least as stressful and dangerous as \n anything the American colonists faced!\n \n As for the hardships and privations of life on the new continent--- \n well, it is true that in the first wave of migration, in both New \n England and Virginia, a considerable number of the colonists were \n incompetent bozos who did not know what they were doing, and who \n starved to death in the midst of plenty. However, after a sufficient \n number of minimally sensible people had arrived in the New World, \n life was easier, not harder, than it had been in the old country. \n Large amounts of land were available, the soil was as yet not \n depleted, forests were vast and game abundant. Society was still run \n in a corporative fashion as it had been in Britain, and settlement \n was more orderly and regulated than it was to be after the \n Revolution. It was in those later days that hardship came to the \n frontier as disorderly masses of people rushed out into the newly \n opened lands in a higglety-pigglety fashion with few supplies, little \n money, and a lack of organization.",

   "No, I think that the damaging effects on the American character came, \n and still come, from the abundance of life, not its privations. In a \n state of abundance you do not need to co-operate with other people to \n survive; you can ignore other people's feelings and opinions with \n impunity. Also, vanity and arrogance are encouraged. It is said that \n the problem with the self-made man is that he worships his creator. \n Those who suffer from the illusion that they do not need the help of \n other people in order to survive often become cocky and unbearably \n self-important. The attitude grows: I'm all right, Jack; so screw you.\n In Germany there is a vice which is much commented upon; it is called \n Schadenfreude, and it means taking pleasure in the misfortunes of \n others. It is a passive vice; if someone slips and falls on a patch \n of ice, and you smile with amusement, that is Schadenfreude. It does \n not mean deliberately and actively setting a booby-trap for another \n person. This second, more active, form of unamiability is a prominent \n feature of the American character, and forms a part of that streak of \n sociopathy and incipient hysteria which makes so many Americans so \n unpleasant to be around. This vice has been neatly summed up by the \n percipient Gore Vidal as: \"It is not enough to succeed; others must fail.\"\n \n Two other important factors in the spiritual deformity of Americans \n are the twin vices of hypocrisy and lying. Hypocrisy exists in every \n society, though Americans seem to cultivate it with special fervor. \n But lying is cultivated with fanatical devotion by Americans; it is \n hypertrophied to a spectacular degree in every aspect of American \n life. Americans lie about everything--- all the time. Morning, noon \n and night, day after day, month after month, year after year---lies, \n lies, lies: rivers of lies, Niagaras of lies, oceans of lies--- \n ceaselessly pouring over the eroding psyches of the American people. \n There are official lies, lies for reasons of state, lies to cover up \n government malfeasance, lies for money, lies for power, lies to \n protect those with money and power, lies in the media, lies in \n entertainment, lies in advertising, lies in public relations, lies to \n cover up lies, and lies to cover up those lies.\n \n Falseness is the very foundation of the modern American character.\n Lying is an obsession in these United States of Hysteria; Americans \n cannot stop lying; they can no longer distinguish truth from \n falsehood; and the most dangerous thing of all is that they believe \n their own lies---they all do, from the zombies at the bottom to the \n vampires at the top. Americans can no longer think straight, and their\n emotions are a mess.",

   "This evil has been carefully cultivated by the vampires who rule us, \n but it is not new; its roots are sunk deep in the American character \n and run back far in time. In fact, at intervals of about twenty to \n thirty years, waves of mass hysteria have broken out in American \n history.\n \n There was the hysteria associated with the Alien and Sedition Act at \n the end of the 1790's. There was a revival of hysteria at the time of \n the War of 1812, then a period of quiescence until the election of \n that loathsome monster, Andrew Jackson. He initiated an almost \n uninterrupted period of hysteria for more than a decade: the \n destruction of the Bank of the United States, the ethnic cleansing \n and genocide of the Five Nations, the anti-foreign, anti-Catholic, \n anti-Mason hysteria of the Know-Nothing Party, and of course the \n Manifest Destiny hysteria that led to the Mexican-American War. That \n war, with barely a pause for breath, initiated the ever-growing \n hysteria of the 1850's which brought on the Civil War. That war was \n the most useless and unnecessary war of modern times; more than two \n per-cent of the American population died because of that war---about \n the same number and percentage that America at present is murdering \n in Iraq. If both sides, North and South, had just sat on their hands \n for thirty years, slavery would have ended anyway---serfdom in Russia \n and slavery in Brazil were long gone by 1890, or was the United \n States so much more backward than Russia and Brazil that slavery \n would have hung on until the twentieth century? All that misery and \n death could have been avoided, and all the wounds and bitterness and \n injustice that lasted so long. But Oh no, Americans must have their \n hysterical fits; by the late 1850's each side had so worked itself \n into a passion, so convinced itself that it was agrieved and wronged, \n so filled itself with righteous indignation, self-pity and \n intransigence that a paroxysm of gibbering, murderous rage could not \n be avoided.\n \n Then there was the peace of exhaustion for thirty-odd years until the \n nonsense of Free Silver and \"You shall not crucify Mankind upon a \n cross of gold\" primed the pump for the phony Maine Incident and the \n Spanish-American War. By this time the hysteria was being much more \n consciously directed. Next was the war hysteria of the First World \n War, the Ku Klux Klan hysteria of the early twenties, not forgetting \n the hysteria that led to Prohibition, which made the world safe for \n the Mafia and the FBI. Take another hop and a skip to the Second \n World War, when hysteria made it seem perfectly acceptable to throw \n American citizens into concentration camps, mass-murder civilians in \n bombing raids, and rain atomic destruction down upon a defeated \n Japan. Then a hysteria which I personally remember, the McCarthyite \n communist witch-hunts which fastened the oppressive military- \n industrial complex upon the American people ever after. People should \n have paid attention to Eisenhower's warnings! \n \n Next the little palace coup of the Kennedy Assassination set the stage \n for the prolonged hysteria of the Vietnam War [see the picture above for \n documentary coverage]. Then there was a longer than usual period of \n relative quiet---just constant, low-level hysteria---until Monika \n Lewinski, 2000 election fraud, neo-con staged 9-11 attacks, and the \n Iraq War---in other words our present bout of general mayhem and \n hysteria. We still have the collapse of the dollar to look forward \n to, and the somewhat slower collapse of the American military. \n \n And when the six percent of the world's population which is represented \n by the citizens of the US find it necessary to live on six percent of \n the world's resources rather than the present twenty-five percent ---- \n that should be quite adequate to fuel another round of perfectly \n futile hysteria.\n \n -\n \n Americans are a vast mass of zombies controlled by a few vampires at \n the top. What is frightening is that even the vampires are zombies.\n \n -",

   "-\n \n The Americans are certainly great hero worshippers, and always\n take heroes from the criminal classes.\n ---- Oscar Wilde\n \n As to you [George Washington], sir, treacherous in private friendship \n and a hypocrite in public life, the world will be puzzled to decide \n whether you are an apostate or an imposter---whether you have \n abandoned good principles or whether you ever had any. \n ----Thomas Paine !!!!!! [in a letter to George Washington]\n \n \n In the posting above of A Peculiar People, I outlined the various major \n episodes of hysteria in the national life of the USA; I glaringly \n omitted the convulsion of insanity which initiated the cycles of \n dementia which we call modern American history. I mean, of course, \n the Revolutionary War. It requires special treatment because it is \n the foundation of that uncritical and childish worship of the \n Founding Fathers which is so nauseating to a clear-minded observer of \n the American scene. I insist on kicking out every prop which supports \n the illusions and vanity of the American people. Americans are like \n drug-addicts and alcoholics, but what they are addicted to are \n illusion and lies. Only if they come to realize how vile that \n addiction is, is there any hope that they may rise out of the gutter \n and end their drug dependency.\n \n As I have previously emphasized, Americans suffer from recurrent \n hysteria, suspicion, defensiveness, and an ingrained drive to escape \n from facts and live in a fantasy-world. This pathology requires \n explanation. I suggest that this disease takes its origin from the \n very foundation of the republic, and that it is the accumulated \n effect of a Fundamental Lie which Americans have ever taken pains to \n hide and deny, until it has become a festering infection touching \n every part of the American psyche. This Lie is that the American \n Revolution was a courageous overthrowing of tyranny and oppression, \n which founded a republic based on reason and respect for human \n rights. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, a large \n segment of the population was swindled by a devious, unscrupulous, \n corrupt and traitorous cabal which, for its own selfish ends, acted \n against the best interests of the people and the state.\n \n This conspiracy had two main foci of evil. In the South there was an \n extravagant and nearly bankrupt group of Virginia planters who wanted \n a break with England so that they could escape the legal debts which \n they had incurred in the home country due to their addiction to \n foreign luxuries. They also wanted to escape the restrictions of \n orderly rule, and were determined to gain exclusive control over the \n government of their state and the exploitation of its people and \n resources. The biggest landowner and real estate speculator in \n Virginia was George Washington. Who of you would trust the biggest \n wheeler-dealer in real estate in your state? Amongst his many \n shenanigans was the business coup of inducing the new federal \n government to buy a large chunk of malarial swamp which he owned---as \n a part of the new District of Columbia!\n \n In the North there was a sinister and corrupt group of traitors which \n was most prominently represented by the smuggler-kingpin of Boston, \n John Hancock---the richest man in America at the time. He was a rum- \n runner, slave-dealer and smuggler whose counterpart in modern America \n would be a Mafia don. In grade school I was taught that he wrote his \n signature in an enormous scrawl on the Declaration of Independence \n \"so that the King of England might read it without his eye-glasses.\" \n Well, that is a fable typical of the American \"educational\" system! \n \n In fact, with his wealth he was bankrolling the rebellion, and in his \n vanity felt that he who pays the piper calls the tune! He was deeply \n grieved and offended that George Washington was chosen to lead the \n troops rather than himself! Amongst Hancock's many illegal and \n nefarious activities was the smuggling of tea from Holland into New \n England. The Boston Tea Party Conspiracy arose because the English \n had set the tax on imported tea too low! It was cheaper to buy legal \n tea from the East India Company than to buy Hancock's smuggled tea! \n \n The Mafioso of Boston was not going to stand for that! The rest is \n history---the official history. Objective historians have noted that \n twenty-five percent of the signers of the Declaration of Independence \n were either smugglers themselves or were connected to the smuggling \n racket. The smuggling of luxury items into early America was as much \n of a curse then as illegal-drug smuggling is today.",

   "Of course there were some minor irritations in the relations between \n America and the Mother Country. Were they such that could not be \n worked out between reasonable people? Were they worth creating the \n enormous tragedies of the Rebellion and its aftermath? Just think, we \n could have been as good as Canada---instead of what we are!\n \n Those who actively supported the Rebellion were a small minority of \n the population---mainly the dregs of society. Their savagery and \n brutality were clearly shown by their treatment of the Loyalists and \n those who did not want to be involved on either side of the fracas. \n \n The rebels would stop at nothing. Murder, torture, the burning of \n homes and farms, the slaughter of domestic animals, the incitement of \n Indians against those who resisted their treason---all this was \n commonplace. The terror was particularly bad in the South, where the \n situation was little different from that in Iraq today. The large \n number of refugees who fled America at the time shows how intolerable \n the situation was. And all this horror was because of some small \n taxes on tea and legal documents? Really! You might as well try to \n make me believe that the neo-cons are winning in Iraq!\n \n Well, the criminal conspiracy succeeded---but only because the French \n declared war on England. The wolves were now in charge of the sheep; \n the looting of America began. The first act of pillage was enshrined \n in the Constitution. During the Insurrection, and later during the \n period of the Articles of Confederation, the rebel regime forced \n people to take worthless paper money as payment for their mounting \n debts. People knew that they had been cheated by the rebels and sold \n off the junk money to speculators for pennies on the dollar. \n Surprise! Surprise! The speculators turned out to be the noble and \n wise Founding Fathers and their henchmen, and they carefully wrote into the \n Constitution itself [Article VI, section 1] that the junk money was \n to be redeemed by the new federal government at full face value! What \n a clever scheme of double taxation! That will show those British \n oppressors!\n \n Well, folks, Americans have been saps and suckers and weaklings from \n day one, and they have tied themselves in knots ever since to keep \n themselves from recognizing the unpalatable truth. This culture of \n denial goes a long way to explaining the psychosis of lying, \n tetchiness and hysteria that afflicts so many inhabitants of this \n country. Americans are in a state of denial, and as long as this \n state continues, hornswoggling scoundrels will continue to cheat them \n to their hearts' content.\n \n As a postscript, if you can possibly still be unsure of the truth of \n all this, I strongly urge you to read a book written during the \n period of the formation of the American character which clearly shows \n the forces at work. It is the 1830 collection of observations by \n Frances Trollope (the mother of the famous novelist, Anthony Trollope): \n The Domestic Manners of the Americans. An on-line version may be found at: \n \n The Domestic Manners of the Americans\n \n Besides being of immense value from an historical and psychological \n perspective, it is a good read. It is funny, witty, sharp, with \n incidents which are often surprisingly moving. There is also some of \n the best descriptive writing I have ever read---an art which is \n almost totally extinct in the modern world. If you read it, you will \n learn much, both good and bad, about the beloved country of the Americans. \n It is amazing how little they have changed over the intervening years.\n \n -\n \n If Americans had any brains, they would put their affairs under the direction of the\n British Colonial Office ---- until they are ready for self-government.\n \n -",

[Have my sentences been short enough for you, my former countrymen?] \n \n The inability of most Americans to think coherently for any length of time is a notable characteristic of the set of mental disorders which mark Americans as a Peculiar People in the world.\n \n There is now a psychological study which documents these facts:\n \n Paying Attention to Not Paying Attention\n \n \n...scientists say, mind-wandering is worth studying because it's just too common to ignore.\n \n Michael Kane, a psychologist at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, sampled the thoughts of students at eight random times a day for a week.

Out of the 126 participants, only one denied any mind-wandering at the sampled moments.\n \n Prior work has also turned up average rates of 30 percent to 40 percent in everyday life. \n \n [SNIP]\n \n A more common task that demands concentration is reading.

The writer assumes that the mental defect is a result of hard-wiring in the brain. For the way Americans are is obviously the way everyone else is!

   "-\n \n One reads about 18th century Londoners who gave gin to infants in order to quiet them; and the use of opium to quiet and comfort children has been a feature of many ages and many cultures. We are rightly shocked by these abuses. But oh! how easy it is to see the speck of dust in another's eye, and how difficult to notice the log jammed into one's own eye!\n \n For decades I have been nauseated by the gay abandon with which parents and guardians of children plop their charges in front of televisions for hours at a time. Talk about child abuse! Apart from the appalling content of the programming, there is an almost deliberate effort to damage the childrens' brains----or should one remove the qualifier \"almost\"?\n \n I was not exposed to television until I was ten years old; it was for only one or two hours in the evening, and it was the slow-moving and relatively logically connected programing of the 1950's. As a result, I consider my powers of concentration to be inferior to those of the scholars of the 19th century, but much superior to those of the people around me who have been raised on television from infancy.\n \n On those rare occasions when I am exposed to the poisonous drug called \"television,\" I am made very uncomfortable by the incessant jumping around of images and the breaking of connections between events; the young, I note, are untroubled by all this. I and the young are wired differently; but we are not hard-wired differently. As we pass through infancy and early childhood, our brains undergo profound modifications; our nerve connections and our abilities to process information are shaped by our environment and by what we habitually perceive. Children are trained to be unable to concentrate! Our rulers want slaves; television gives them the means to mold those slaves. Parents are murdering the minds of their children by feeding them the most toxic drug there is: television!\n \n And people wonder why there is an epidemic of Attention Deficit Disorder! That just shows that Americans have lost the ability to add two and two together, or notice that B follows A! No, following the American tradition of never dealing with root causes, but only treating symptoms, we stuff the abused children with powerful pharmaceutical drugs which also alter the wiring of the brain, and in ways which are unknown and unstudied! [For Americans must be as diseased as possible if the pharmaceutical industry is to maintain its profits!] Oh, you more degraded creatures than cattle, wake up!\n \n Television is a drug far worse than heroin, and harder to kick. If you still cannot comprehend the full horror of the situation, or dare think that it is true, make this experiment: For six months, stop watching television and movies, do not listen to radio or pop music. Go cold-turkey. Most of you will not be able to do it. The pains of withdrawal from your drugs will be too great. You will crumble and break and crawl back to your slavery.\n \n How ironic that millions of harmless people have been thrown into prison for the consumption of relatively benign recreational drugs!\n \n The people who should be thrown into prison, and for years and years, are the people of Hollywood and those running the other media empires. They are mass-murderers worse than Hitler, Stalin and Mao. The dictators murdered the bodies of milllions. The Moguls of Media are murdering the minds of billions.\n \n -\n \n The Television Generation has seen everything a thousand times and remembers none of it.\n \n -\n \n [A friend of mine has supplemented my dictum as follows]:\n \n The members of the Television Generation have seen one thing all their lives, and they remember all of it ---- and now they are running the show!\n \n -",

   "-\n \n Zombiedom (or should that be, \"zombie-dumb\"?) arises from the susceptibility of common people to the propaganda ceaselessly pouring out of the boob-tube and other sources of indoctrination. These forms of manipulation are carefully constructed so as to take advantage of the emotional weaknesses of their anthropoid audience. The hominids are normally quite unaware that they are being manipulated emotionally. It is similar to the way religion preys upon the hopes and fears of simple-minded people, but it is far more efficient than religion. That is why the state, after so many centuries of strict control, permits religion to fade away. It is no longer needed to control people.\n \n One can see how easily the zombies on this site are whipped into a frenzy by the few simple remarks that I make, while they are oblivious to war profiteers and other scum of the earth skinning them alive. This is because my remarks run counter to their indoctrination, while they are lulled to sleep by the people who are skinning them alive.\n \n I remember, as a teenager in the 1950's, reading a book by Vance Packard, The Hidden Persuaders, which described how the PR (public relations) types were already, in the 1930's, covertly photographing and studying people who shopped in markets. They noted that, if their subjects' eye-blink rates went below a certain number per minute, they were in a state of semi-hypnosis and were more likely to make impulse-purchases. They discovered that the arrangements of the colours of the boxes on the display shelves could induce this state of semi-hypnosis in many people. Remember that as you walk down the aisles of your local supermarket. \n \n Well, it has been nearly a century since those first, crude efforts at sub-conscious manipulation. Everything is far, far more sophisticated today. When I was a teenager, many people were very concerned about subliminal advertising. Do you hear anything about it today? Yet the techniques are much more advanced. Look at the flashing lights, the endless jumping from image to image, several times per second, to which people subject themselves when they watch TV. There is no need to enslave people's bodies, when you can enslave their minds.\n \n -",

   "-\n \n I remember a story from the late 1950's when Nikita Khrushchev made a trip to the U.S.A. and was f\u00eated by President Eisenhower. Khrushchev was given a whirl-wind tour of the wonders of 1950's America. As the trip progressed, Khrushchev became more taciturn and morose, and finally he could contain himself no longer. \"How do you do it?\" he burst out to Eisenhower. Eisenhower was a bit taken aback, but he gamely replied, \"Well, it is all the result of the free enterprise system, which liberates the forces of productivity and ....\" \"No, no,\" interrupted Khrushchev, \"I mean, how do you achieve such uniformity of thought without the use of terror?\"\n \n My Webster's Third New International Dictionary defines \"totalitarian\" as:\n \n of or relating to a political regime based on subordination of the individual to the state and strict control of all aspects of the life and productive capacity of the nation, especially by coercive measures. \n \n Based on this definition, all modern societies are totalitarian, and they have become more and more totalitarian ever since the end of the Second World War. Of course, to make this definition even more applicable to modern conditions, \"and subliminal psychological pressure\" should be added after \"coercive measures.\" \n \n If the following statement is indeed a quotation of Adolf Hitler, he enunciated a bitter truth:\n \n The great strength of the totalitarian state is that it forces those who fear it to imitate it. \n ---- Adolf Hitler\n \n The word totalitarian derives from the Latin totaliter, \"wholly, completely,\" and it means a society totally controlled, and composed of totally uniform elements. Our societies are totalitarian beyond the wildest fantasies of a Hitler or a Stalin. Most people are carefully guided and brainwashed all through their lives ---- tens of millions all thinking the same thoughts, watching the same entertainment, all parroting the same simple-minded lies and half-truths which they have absorbed from the organs of propaganda (that is, the mass media). To anyone who is even half-awake, these zombies seem like the walking corpses of the Night of the Living Dead. If anyone does awake from Goya's \"Sleep of Reason,\" he finds that our present social system is impervious to change; it is like trying to swim in a sea of molasses: a system \"of the zombies, by the zombies, for the zombies.\" Eventually, the insanity of the system produces catastrophic breakdowns, as we have seen periodically all through the twentieth century. And here we are again, on the brink of another tedious social and economic collapse.\n \n Only a zombie could imagine that the societies in which we live have any real relationship to \"democracy.\"\n \n The zombies pay lip-service to the word \"democracy,\" but deep in their hearts they hate and fear the real thing.\n -\n \n Only an incompetent totalitarianism employs terror; modern, efficient McFascism serves you with a smile and strives to make you love your slavery.\n \n -",

Ah, well!\n \n Tempora mutantur nos et mutamur in illis.\n [The times are changed, and we are changed with them.]\n \n Americans have lost even those few virtues which they formerly possessed. (By the way, have you noticed that whenever the word \"community\" appears in modern American parlance, it means \"isolation,\" \"atomization\" and generally the very opposite of the traditional meaning of \"community?\" Example: \"Internet Community\") [Another triumph of George Orwell's NewSpeak!]\n \n In some ways, the development of America parallels that of Germany. Many years ago, the Germans were noted as being educated and cultured. Then came the Franco-Prussian War and the German Empire. The coarsening of the German character between 1870 and 1914 was quite remarkable. There was a similar development in Britain between the Indian Mutiny and 1914, though the process was somewhat mitigated by Eton and the Universities. (The best were sent out to govern India; the second-best were retained to govern England; the third-rank were sent out to govern the colonies)\n \n Similarly, there has been a definite change in the American character since 1940, and it has not been a change for the better. All of these examples demonstrate the dangers which power and wealth present to people who are not prepared for them.\n \n Anyway, there are some positive features to \"gated communities.\" They are voluntary concentration camps where the rich and the middle classes can be isolated. As an ultimate conclusion, the dreams of Marx and Lenin may finally be realized. Don't murder the rich; just isolate them, give them the toys which they seem to crave, and let them amuse themselves until they die: much cheaper than the fuss and bother of class warfare. The golf courses which surround them will act as a cordon sanitaire protecting the rest of society from being infected by their polluted nature.\n \n Besides, who know? As society breaks down in the coming years, and the gated communities become more and more isolated, the inhabitants may be forced to co-operate with each other in order to survive, and the ghettos of the rich may revert to being real communities. Market gardens could be established in the golf courses, and the cycle of society from peasant to rich, back to peasant, will be complete. The middle classes may yet become human again.\n \n On that hopeful and pious note, I shall end.\n ------------------------------------------------------------\n \n America has not yet suffered; it is an illusion to think that it can possess the virtues of command.\n ---- Ortega y Gasset, The Revolt of the Masses\n \n Civilized Europeans came to America to tame the wilderness, and the wilderness turned them into savages.\n ---- Yours Truly\n \n -",

   "-\n \n When I was young, I went down to Mexico and saw \"gated communities\" for the first time. At the time, I thought they were very un-American. Ah, well!\n \n Tempora mutantur nos et mutamur in illis.\n [The times are changed, and we are changed with them.]\n \n Americans have lost even those few virtues which they formerly possessed. (By the way, have you noticed that whenever the word \"community\" appears in modern American parlance, it means \"isolation,\" \"atomization\" and generally the very opposite of the traditional meaning of \"community?\" Example: \"Internet Community\") [Another triumph of George Orwell's NewSpeak!]\n \n In some ways, the development of America parallels that of Germany. Many years ago, the Germans were noted as being educated and cultured. Then came the Franco-Prussian War and the German Empire. The coarsening of the German character between 1870 and 1914 was quite remarkable. There was a similar development in Britain between the Indian Mutiny and 1914, though the process was somewhat mitigated by Eton and the Universities. (The best were sent out to govern India; the second-best were retained to govern England; the third-rank were sent out to govern the colonies)\n \n Similarly, there has been a definite change in the American character since 1940, and it has not been a change for the better. All of these examples demonstrate the dangers which power and wealth present to people who are not prepared for them.\n \n Anyway, there are some positive features to \"gated communities.\" They are voluntary concentration camps where the rich and the middle classes can be isolated. As an ultimate conclusion, the dreams of Marx and Lenin may finally be realized. Don't murder the rich; just isolate them, give them the toys which they seem to crave, and let them amuse themselves until they die: much cheaper than the fuss and bother of class warfare. The golf courses which surround them will act as a cordon sanitaire protecting the rest of society from being infected by their polluted nature.\n \n Besides, who know? As society breaks down in the coming years, and the gated communities become more and more isolated, the inhabitants may be forced to co-operate with each other in order to survive, and the ghettos of the rich may revert to being real communities. Market gardens could be established in the golf courses, and the cycle of society from peasant to rich, back to peasant, will be complete. The middle classes may yet become human again.\n \n On that hopeful and pious note, I shall end.\n ------------------------------------------------------------\n \n America has not yet suffered; it is an illusion to think that it can possess the virtues of command.\n ---- Ortega y Gasset, The Revolt of the Masses\n \n Civilized Europeans came to America to tame the wilderness, and the wilderness turned them into savages.\n ---- Yours Truly\n \n -\n\n \n Gated streets were common in London in the XIX century.

(American corporate media, by the way, loved it.) \n \n As for the 2004 re-election - when his approval rate was at most 40% - it was a mix of low-tech - absentee ballots that were never mailed, rejected \"provisional ballots\", \"spoiled ballots\" - and high-tech - via scores of dodgy Diebold machines - corruption. \n \n [SNIP]\n \n Baghdadis today compare Bush's oeuvre in honor of democracy and the free market in Iraq to Genghis Khan's in the 14th century. Khan's pyramid of skulls left by the Tigris find echo in Bush's benchmarks: at least 1 million deaths caused directly or indirectly by the war and occupation, more than 4 million internally and externally displaced, mass poverty, 70% unemployment, and the virtual nonexistence of fresh drinking water, sanitation, electricity, medical care, education, and security. \n \n [SNIP]\n \n Under his watch, a mega-bubble economy based on speculative greed and massive fraud went bonkers - disaster capitalism at home. At his final presser Bush had the gall - of course not contested - to say it was not his fault the financial crisis happened during his tenure. Of course, he forgot to say this was a crisis by design - guaranteeing an even greater concentration of financial and economic power, in global terms, for a minimum elite comprising Masters of the Universe JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Citigroup. \n \n [SNIP]\n \n What a record: stolen elections, corporate greed, fraud and corruption, unlimited spending, wealth redistribution (to the top), no checks and balances, rampant militarization, the destruction of Iraq, permanent war, and unquantifiable, unrepayable national debt. Not many world emperors are able to create a vast wasteland, call it a government, and then retire. \n \n \n",
