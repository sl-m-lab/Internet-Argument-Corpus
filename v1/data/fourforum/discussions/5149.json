And no, I wouldn't quit if I had the chance, and I don't know anyone that I work around that whould.\n \n I'll admit, I had to be dragged into that recruiting office by my brother and his friends, but they got a big THANK YOU in the end. \n \n It's not all about the war  either. It's being there to support your country if some idiot attacks. I'd rather be fighting than huddled up in a hole somewhere with people complaining why America doesn't respond faster when something happens. Maybe because most American's are just talk.\n Everyone wants the easy life though, and expects someone else to fight for them.\n THAT'S the problem",
