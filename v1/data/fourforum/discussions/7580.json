Like I said a state can ban marriage all together.\n \n \nWhile the state court is no doubt correct in asserting that marriage is a social relation subject to the State's police power\n\n \n The Loving case was decided based on the equal protection clause which was created to deal with issues of race (thus the rational basis test and strict test). Since this was a race issue the strict test applied and the states failed to provide a good enough reason. The equal protection clause wouldn't work for gay marriage as it didn't work for 8 outta 9 justices in the Lawrence vs Texas case but the one justice that did think equal protection applied to homosexual sodomy even said it wouldn't apply to marriage:\n \n That this law as applied to private, consensual conduct is unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause does not mean that other laws distinguishing between heterosexuals and homosexuals would similarly fail under rational basis review. Texas cannot assert any legitimate state interest here, such as national security or preserving the traditional institution of marriage. Unlike the moral disapproval of same-sex relations-the asserted state interest in this case-other reasons exist to promote the institution of marriage beyond mere moral disapproval of an excluded group.\n\n \n So once again, marriage is not a right granted by the constitution and no court has found it to be so. Your equal protection is not looking good either...I guess you are going to have to try using Due Process like they wrongfully did in the Lawernce case and so many others.

   "Try reading all the way to the end.\n \n What a waste of time.\n\n Ok I believe I have time to address this now:\n \n First: lets seperate this into two areas. 1) The constitution guarntees a right to marriage and 2) Loving v. Virginia was the case the recognized this\n \n I will address 2 first:\n I think that Loving v. Virginia went just far enough to say that marriage is a fundamental right but they didn't go as far as to say the whole institution is protected by the constitution. Two cases after that one, Zablocki v. Wisconsin and Turner v. Safley probably pushed it over the edge into saying it is constitutionaly protected. Oddly enough the Turner opinion was written by O'Connor who said in the Lawrence v. Texas case that gay marriage wasn't protected. Never the less, the whim of the courts will probably decide this soon enough.\n \n Point 1:\n The constitution does not say anything about marriage. I first should note that just because a judge says something does not make it true. Plessy v. Ferguson was upheld numerous times before being overturned for example.\n \n First off I challenge someone to find the word \"privacy\", \"marriage\",\"abortion\", or \"homosexual sodomy\" in the constitution...or even a form of the word. The claim started in Loving and expanded in Turner and Zablocki use the Due Process clause of the 14th amendment:\n \nNo State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law\n Now the question obviously becomes what is \"life\",\"libery\", and \"property\". The courts decided that \"liberty\" will mean what the court wants it to mean and \"due process\" will mean that you have to convince the court it is a good idea. This way of looking at it is known as \"subsantive due process\". A wonderful little phrase that makes one wonder how the court knows what liberties are. Well, they decided that liberty will mean \"deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition\" as liberties are fundamental rights. So lets just except the rather suspect doctrine and explore what it would mean for gay marriage. First off, you must say \"is marriage a fundamental right of our society\". The answer is obviously yes. It is. However, the question isn't whether marriage is a fundamental right but whether gay marriage is a fundamental right. Marriage had a tradiational meaning of a man and a woman... in fact, it still does. Using just \"marriage\" is misleading and misses the point they are trying to make. It would be the same as saying that marriage between two 10yr olds is fundamental. Nevertheless, the whole idea of substantive due process is to find a way to make law and further the idea of the \"living constitution\". I have never heard of a legal document morphing like our constitution must (according to some). I suppose that the Patriot Act could morph one day to mean we can read your thoughts without even having to change the text of the act. A living constitution is not more free flowing to change but rather more rigid by setting in stone morality and laws of this country by 5 people not elected.\n \n All that to say I think the doctrine of subsantive due process is wrong and only helps further the personal will of a few people. I will now address the claim as it should be dealt with. First of all, marriage is not protected by the consttiution because it simply is not there. In fact, it is state institution and only by the grace of the state do you even have such a thing. I argue that a state could simply say \"we don't do marriage anymore\". This wouldn't say that a church couldn't marry two people but rather the state will have nothing to do with marriage much like they don't give any special treatment to owners of 19\" LCD monitors. I find no where in the constitution that says a state must provide marriage licenses and grant benefits to the citizens of the state. This leaves us with the Equal Protection question. It is a very valid point that takes some looking into. The Equal Protection clause has two tests associated with it. A rational test and strict test. The strict test applies to cases of race because the amendment was pretty much a race based amendment. It is pretty hard to pass a strict test but it did happen with the affirmative action case (another wrongly decided case). None the less, this case has nothing to do with race so it should only have to be subject to the rational basis test. This test only says that a State must have a legitiment reason for having a law that on its face discriminates. The State seems to have a good reason...they want to protect the traditional view of marriage. Not allowing 10yr olds to marry or a 50yr old marrying a 12yr old are all examples of laws protecting the traditional view of marriage. Since it passes this test the courts should go no further and declare the law valid. Some argue that this a ban on gay marriage actually discriminates against the \"principal actor\" (meaning a specific person or people). This was used in the Lawerence v. Texas case. O'Connor said \"\"While it is true that the law applies only to conduct, the conduct targeted by this law is conduct that is closely correlated with being homosexual. Under such circumstances, Texas' sodomy law is targeted at more than conduct. It is instead directed toward gay persons as a class.\"\" Scalia correctly points out that \"Of course the same could be said of any law. A law against public nudity targets \"the conduct that is closely correlated with being a nudist,\" and hence \"is targeted at more than conduct\"; it is \"directed toward nudists as a class.\" But be that as it may. Even if the Texas law does deny equal protection to \"homosexuals as a class,\" that denial still does not need to be justified by anything more than a rational basis, which our cases show is satisfied by the enforcement of traditional notions of sexual morality.\" This same argument would probably be waged in the gay marriage battle. It may be a very bad and stupid law...however, stupid laws are not unconstitutional.",

You don't need a constitution to have all the laws in it and if states want to do that then so be it. We do have a process, though, to make laws. The only thing the constitution did was set up a way to make them (in other words set the powers). The bill of rights just set a few extra guidelines and amendments afterwards were to clearify some things. If the constitution just implies everything then why on earth do we need a legislative branch? We could just not pay them and have the courts decide everything. Maybe the constitution implies the proper rates for the income tax in the 16th amendment. The constitution doesn't set out law, it sets up structure. \n \n You claim that the constitution sets up \"general principals\" that the federal and state governments must follow. Well, mainly the federal government and if my general principals you mean general structure such as 3 branches with these set powers then yes...that is what it does. The amendments go on to say you have these powers but there are a certain things we are gonna keep you from doing. I don't know of any \"general principal\" that applies to marriage. Surely you refer to the due process clause...no person shall be denied life, liberty, or property without due process of law. Even assuming marriage would be this \"liberty\" the passing of an amendment to a state constitution would surely be a form of due process. Even so, I don't know how a judge get to define liberty as such. Perhaps the people define liberty and then...if denied without due process you violate the 14th amendment (such as dening someone marriage in a state that allows marriage even though no law restricts them from marrying). \n \n I don't just make this stuff up as you claim. Reading the constitution for what it says as opposed to what you want it to mean was the standard way to be a judge up until (around) the Warren Court--who was a legislature I might add. Now we have to coin a term for the proper and traditional way to be a judge...orginalist.\n \n So I need you to tell me why the constitution should be a \"living constitution\", why the doctrine of substantive due process exists, and how marriage relates to any of that. You never addressed the points or any points in all of my posts. I would gladly do a formal debate on this topic if you so desire.",

Friedman instead charged Burk, who is accused of slapping his live-in girlfriend, with misdemeanor assault that could lead to only six moths in jail. The state's 25-year-old domestic violence law was not previously limited to married people.\n \n In April 2005, Warren County Common Pleas Judge Neal Bronson threw out a felony domestic violence charge against Michael Carswell of South Lebanon, who was accused of assaulting his live-in girlfriend. Bronson reduced Carswell's charge to misdemeanor assault. Bronson said that the anti-marriage law (Issue 1) rendered the domestic violence law unconstitutional because it prohibits legal recognition of any relationship that attempts to \"mimic\" marriage.\n \n On December 12, 2005, the 12th District Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal of the felony domestic violence case. Warren County Prosecutor Rachel Hutzel said that Bronson's opinion jeopardized 50 percent of the domestic violence cases in Warren County. Hutzel proceeded to back up the domestic violence charges with an additional charge of felonious assault. The appeals court said that the Ohio Defense of Marriage Act and the domestic violence law were intended to address different issues and they do not cancel each other out.\n",

   "If heterosexuals right to marry were under attack, do you think conservatives would then say it was? I do. \n That seems rather irrelevant at this juncture. It still isn't there. I think you are probably right though...conservatives as well as liberals will try to twist the constitution to make it mean what they want it to mean....I remember some conservatives claiming flag burning was not protected or that making fun of celebrities was protected (see Larry Flynt v. People). It goes both ways and both sides are wrong...marriage is not in the constitution, flag burning is protected by the 1st amendment, aboriton is not in the constitution...not to difficult unless you are a living constitutionalist...in that case it all depends on what you ate that morning.\n \n \nMy question was, do you think the majority of average American voters know better how to interpret the United States Contitution better than the supreme court justices. If the majority is to rule shouldn't they all be experts on constitutional rights like the judges are?\n I don't think majority should rule..which is exactly why I believe in orginialism. With a living constitution you either have to take the will of the majority or take your own personal views...none of those are acceptable to me. And to answer your question, the majority of Americans have no idea how the constitution works which is why we have so many living constitutionalists.\n \n \nAre you not against gay marriage? If so, then you are part of the majority. And if the majority wants to amend the constituion based on their own \"views\" which in turn are based on the bible my point is that they would rather have America ruled by the bible than the constitution. Lets leave interpreting the constitution up to the experts and not the American people.\n I'm not in the majority when it comes to the constitution (although I used to be prior to the Warren court). In fact, I bet the majority of Americans would say marriage is in the constitution. As for gay marriage, yeah, I am probably against it and probably all other state sponsered marriage.\n \n \nConservatives are much more about legislating there personal views and beliefs than liberals. History shows us this.\n Well in the legislature this is fine. In fact, how else would you do it? My problem is legislating on the bench....this is neither a conservative nor a liberal battle but rather an orginalist v. living constitutionalist battle...it just so happens that conservatives decided to annex the orginalist and so the liberals had to take the living constitution side (probably stemed from abortion).",
