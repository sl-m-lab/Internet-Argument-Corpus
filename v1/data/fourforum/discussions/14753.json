   "PottersvilleUSA, I've never had reason to doubt any USA presidents' patriotism. Unfortunately it's convenient too rationalize policies that are to our own or supporters' best interests are also to that of the nation's best interests. I too often have good reason to doubt their judgment.\n \n I'm confident that the policies Obama supported would have been to our nation's best interests. His lack of commitment to his own opinions does himself, the Democratic Party and our nation a great disservice.\n \n In 2008 I decided to cease voting for those I'm less opposed to. If I have no opportunity to vote in favor of something positive, I will decline to cast any vote.\n \n In 2009 the minimum wage rate was increased but Obama made no serious attempt to either to have it annually cost of living adjusted, (COLA'd) or to use such a proposal as a \"political chip\" to gain a greater 2008 increase of the minimum rate. (I do note that I never found a quote promoting a COLA'd minimum wage rate that was directly attributed to Obama himself; I was so desperate to vote find something worthy of a vote).\n \n He had not yet drawn a firm line and fought for his \"government option\" but I gave him the benefit of the doubt. I again voted for Democratic candidates in 2010. In 2011 Obama acquiesced and surrendered to his opposition. Failure is an acceptable option; little of significant value has ever been achieved without suffering earlier failures. Obama did not \"lose the government option\", he failed to stand and fight for it. (I agree that we cannot completely dismiss his 2,000 page healthcare act of undetermined quality). \n \n The Democratic Party declined to bring income taxes onto the floors of the U.S. Congress prior to the 2010 elections; In 2010 I declined to vote for Democrats. Last year I cast my vote for the Green Party's congressional candidate.\n \n I believe Obama correctly stated we cannot afford to extend the tax reductions for those of our 2% highest taxable incomes but he undermined his own position by not urging congressional Democrats to confront the issue prior to the 2010 elections. Obama has acted contrary to both our nation's short and long term economic interests. Due to his acquiescing and surrendering, USA's federal and individual states' budget deficits will be greater and our economic recovery will be slower.\n \n I will no longer vote for Democrats until they regain and retain some courage and integrity. Obama is the titular leader of the Party. It appears that I will not be voting for Democrats in 2012.\n \n Respectfully, Supposn",
