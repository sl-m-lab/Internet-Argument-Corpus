   "Below are some statistics taken from a web sight called if america knew - http://www.ifamericansknew.org/index.html`.\n \n \n a) 1 Israeli is being held prisoner by Palestinians, while 9,599 Palestinians are currently imprisoned by Israel.\n \n b) 60+ new Jewish-only settlements have been built on confiscated Palestinian land between March 2001 and July 11, 2003. There have been 0 cases of Palestinians confiscating Israeli land and building settlements.\n \n c) 0 Israeli homes have been demolished by Palestinians and 4,170 Palestinian homes have been demolished by Israel since September 29, 2000.\n \n d) Israel has been targeted by at least 65 UN resolutions and the Palestinians have been targeted by none.\n \n e) The U.S. gives $15,139,178 per day to the Israeli government and military and $232,290 per day to Palestinian NGO's.\n \n f) 7,633 Israelis and 30,670 Palestinians have been injured since September 29, 2000.\n \n g) 1,084 Israelis and 4,171 Palestinians have been killed since September 29, 2000.\n \n h) 121 Israeli children have been killed by Palestinians and 779 Palestinian children have been killed by Israelis since September 29, 2000.\n \n Statistics over a period of time are one of the best ways of telling the true story of a situation and not clouded by political, religous or other matters that bog down the overall picture of a conflict. There is no hiding from statistics as the numbers can not lie and do not give personal opinion, but it is interesting to see how different people can interpret the same figures in different ways though. Any disputes with the statistical facts posted please post what you think the rights number are and any additionl statistics on the conflict please post as well. What I want to do is take the first statistic which is the total number of prisoners held by both sides (a).\n \n It shows that the Palestinian are holding one Israeli soldier prisoner and that the Israelis are holding 9,599. Okay that is what the figures say about the total number of prisoners, but lets look deeper into it using the figures as a base. To start with the treatment and condition of the Israeli soldier being held has to be established by the UN or a body dedicated to human rights of prisoners in capitivity to assertain that he is in good health. Also a list of any other Israeli prisoner being held in the past and their treatment as well. With the number of prisoners being held by Israel a more detailed and in depth aproach is required just becase of the larger number of prisoners being held. A time table of when each individual was taken prisoner. The Health and age of the individual at the time of capture. The crime for each individual and length of sentence. Any medical records of each prisoner while being held in captivity. Viisitation rights and frequency of family visits over the whole length of each individual prisoners sentence. Mortality rate of prisoners - i.e. how many have died in captivity and reason for death, age, place of berial and autopsy records. Also interegation notes carried out by any govermental force on any prisoner. the list probably goes on, but what I want is complete transparancy over all prisoners being held on both sides to asertain that no human rights abuses have being carried out by the Palestinian authority or Israeli goverment. The ramervications of this are very big indeed. If one of the sides can be found and proved to have being carried out human rights abuses on an individual or mass scale it could be considered a war crime. Even if you can only establish incompetancy on a govermental scale than it could mean that the power to of that goverment to incarserate prisoners be removed from them and given to an international body. My fear is that human rights abuses have being occuring on both sides, but it is just that on the Israeli side it is done on much larger scale due to the fact that they are holding 9598 more prisoners than the Palestinians are at present.\n \n Look at Quatanomo Bay that the Americans have being using to hold terror suspects and the human rights abuses that have occured there. You can not trust any goverment to be responsible at a time of war with the welfare of its prisoners. Only an outside unbiased body can really put the welfare of prisoners as it top priority. One thing I like about dealing with the Middle East prisoners issue is that it does not matter what the prisoners crime is he or she still deserves a basic standard treatment of human rights. So basically if the Israelis are holding a terorist prisoner for comiting murder then he or she still deserves the basic standard of human rights treatment and any infringement of his or her civil libities whilst in captivity is ilegal and could be considered a war crime. This is the same for the Palestinian authority or the faction holding the Israeli soldier. Goverments have to be completly accountable on this and there is no justification for any reason for the vilation of any prisoner human rights while being held in prison for any lenght of time.\n \n After reading this could I ask you to state whether you thing a complete investigation into the human rights of prisoners being held in Israel and the two refugee camps should occur. How in depth it need to be and what should happen if human rights abuses can be clearly idenfied and proven?",
