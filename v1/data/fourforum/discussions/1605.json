   "Thefirst 5 books of the bible contain two texts in it, the J and E texts which represent two different traditions and legends of two different peoples which ended up becoming combined to form the Jews. However as these are both the word of god they were both included when it was writen down for fearing of modifing the Word of God. Both texts have very different styles and is quite obviuous apparently when reading un translated verions, the J text (from what I remember) is a lot more like traditional religions with fanatastic tales and long descriptions while the E text (assuming I have them right, can't quite remember which what the letters stand for, Jacob and Esau I think) is very brief when it comes to desciptions and is very bear bones in stlye, only statements of what happened.\n Or at least that is as close as I can remeber from philosophy when we did the different stlyes of ancient thinking (Hebrew and Greek, though the J text actually counts as greek style). Can't remember the name of the person who first did it, oh well, did my best.",

   "Don't ask, there are replies but they will seem bizarre if you are not a creationist. \n \n Main ones are go from- given the longer lifespans of thing then, and the fact Iguanas and crocodiles do not stop growing they are just old lizards, to they did exist but now don't, either died in the flood (you can not carbon date them;)) or from other disaster and have not evolved again. There maybe some more but not being a creationist I don't really know. Getting hung up over dinosaurs could be considered the worst position to take as far as evolution vs creationism goes, there are far more fundamental flaws than the absense of dinosaurs.\n \n Don't argue with me about bible inaccuraces, I have absolutley no faith in anything apart fro the histories, but find the process of religion quite interesting in itself so can argue the otherside when it comes to technical matters rather than fatih based ones. \n \n However the two versions do not nessarily mean that much trying to disprove it other than that there must be some inaccuracy in it somewhere (you've played chinese whispers, you arn't going to be popular by declaring that the original person either never said whatever he claims to, nor if you claim that the person who taped the original is wrong) the level of this is up for discussion.",

Did the bible writers know about the existence of dinosaurs? Maybe not.\n\n Actually the 7 days of creatin is a euphemism. There is no logic way the universe was created in 7 days. Simple math Rate=Distance/Time. If you find a far enought star you can get the bare minimum age, the farther the object the older the minimum. Thats why scientist trip out over telescopes.\n \n I don't understand how people can deny things as stable as light speed and algebra, when they use them every day in modern technology. Maybe if we were read more, and everyday items were not so cutting edge, or blackbox like more people would understand. Think of how most of modern science was started in an equalibrium of simple (observable) technology, and lots of book readers.",

   "When you have God, you can trenscend many of the physical laws governing the universe now.\n\n That's simpleton theology. God created the laws of the universe and then broke them just because he can. Creationism explains nothing because it resorts to miracle to explain everything. Thus, it makes it fruitless to even attempt to explain nature in a rational way because at the base of it all is a god who changes the rules as he goes. Whatever we don't understand can be attributed to magic by an unseen being and we don't have to search for explanations any more.\n \nWhat if he created things at different places and decided to give them a constant speed?\n\n Right. The old \"god created light on the way to earth\" argument. One problem with that is that we observe events that occur at great distances from earth. It isn't just light but the whole spectrum of energy. In 1987 a supernova was observed. This supernova is close enough to earth that its distance can be measured by several methods. It is 170,000 light years away. Several predictions have been made about this supernova that have been found to be true. For example, the presence of Co-56 and Co-57 by gamma ray emission and by the light caused in the gases around the supernova by this radiation. The decay curve of these was also predicted and has conformed exactly to what was predicted. Furthermore, it was predicted that the shock wave from the supernova would light up the ring (1.37 light years in diameter) of debris that had been ejected from the star earlier. Since the mid 1990s astronomers have been watching that happen. It is just now reaching the maximum. You can see it the picture linked at the bottom.\n \n What I am saying is that your claim is that your god created history. Your god created evidence of events that never really happened. You are saying that rather than predicting the course of events that are following natural laws that are understood, scientists are predicting the nature of the lies that your god created. Your god lied to us and created a history of events that never happened.\n \nHe did not have to create everything at a central point, as is being inferred.\n\n And he didn't have to make it look as if everything is expanding from a central point. He didn't have to make it look like a star went supernova 170,000 years ago if the universe is only 6000 years old. By the way, SN 1987 A is only one of several examples of your god creating lies.\n \nAlso, reptiles were created during the same day as the rest of land animals. In the book of Job, you see that dinosaurs and humans did live together.\n\n As has been pointed out, dinosaurs were not reptiles. Some of them seem to have been endothermic and one lineage had feathers. But the Bible doesn't mention dinosaurs anywhere, not even in Job. Read some Bible discussion written by someone not as prone to fantasy. It is beyond belief that anyone could read that story and claim that it is historical.

Also my religion does not believe God makes up all these constants just to change them to variables at his whim. It is like the DMV changing the rules of the randomly during the day.
