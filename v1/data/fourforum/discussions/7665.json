   "In 1927, Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. declared it \"better for all the world\" if the \"manifestly unfit\" could be stopped from reproducing. \"Three generations of imbeciles are enough,\" he famously wrote in his ruling in Buck v. Bell, which affirmed the constitutionality of forced sterilization of people deemed genetically inferior. . . . in the mid-1800's . . . the British polymath Sir Francis Galton . . . introduced the idea of intelligence as an inherited trait and . . . developed a science to promote it, which he named eugenics. In America, Galton's ideas were picked up by the biologist Charles Davenport, who in 1904 established Cold Spring Harbor laboratory on Long Island as a national center for eugenics research and policy planning. \n \n . . . Davenport created a Eugenics Records Office and recruited an ambitious young high school teacher named Harry Laughlin to join him in an enormous project that sent fieldworkers across the country to identify the \"germ-plasm\" of unfit family strains so that it could be eradicated. Laughlin became an influential developer of American compulsory sterilization policy, which had officially begun in 1907 when Indiana passed a law allowing scientists to use surgical methods to eradicate the unfit . . . .He helped Congress formulate the 1924 Immigration Act, which kept out \"inferior\" people from Southern and Eastern Europe. Bruinius deftly plays up the contrast between the eugenicists' obsession with cold measurements of human value and their own messy lives, which were marked by disease and behavior that could have qualified them as unfit: Galton suffered from severe depression; Davenport had one child who was sickly and another who was apparently dyslexic; and Laughlin was afflicted with epilepsy. \n \n In America and elsewhere, enthusiasm for eugenics was broadly supported by elites. In Britain, people as varied as Winston Churchill and George Bernard Shaw embraced its goals, and there was lively debate about how much the state itself should control reproduction of individuals. Eugenic science especially appealed to Fabian socialists, who saw it as further justification for abolishing class - after all, once the playing field was level the effect of heredity could finally express itself clearly and be studied. \n \n In this country, eugenic theory and practice engaged the likes of Theodore Roosevelt, the birth control crusader Margaret Sanger and leaders of the Carnegie and Rockefeller foundations. It galvanized temperance advocates, suffragists, and liberal American churches and synagogues. Citizens enthusiastically entered \"Fitter Family\" and \"Better Baby\" contests.\n\n \n From a book review of BETTER FOR ALL THE WORLD: The Secret History of Forced Sterilization and America's Quest for Racial Purity by Harry Bruinius:\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/26/books/review/26satel.html\n \n Hmmm, Teddy Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, the Rockefeller foundations, millions of Americans, the State of Indiana. . . all these embraced the concept of EUGENICS.\n \n Interesting, yes?",

That is the ideology behind the pro-choice stance.\nBoth deny people something. Eugenics denies people the joy of parenthood. Abortion denies life to the growing fetus. There's a point in the development of the fetus that the right of the mother to abort infringes on somebody else's life. I've heard all sorts of ludicrous arguments about the baby not being a person 'til it breathes air and cries, but I've seen sonograms of womb-bound babies with beating hearts, sucking their thumbs and pulling on their own toes repeatedly. There is a point in their development that they become somebody else to deal with. Killing them after that point should only happen when the mother's life is endangered by sustaining the baby. To argue that life begins at conception is not ridiculous. Life actually does begin there. The living thing has no nervous system and can feel no pain at that time but life has begun. I don't know the point at which the baby could survive outside the womb, but it's certainly well before nine months have passed. Many premature babies have survived and become beautiful people.\n \n \n \n\n Agreed, and I have not done enough research on this to take a stance on defining the point during pregnancy at which we should deny abortion.

Would you support laws to prevent late term abortions?\n \n For the record, I've changed a bit on the abortion issues lately. Women should definitely have control of their bodies and should have the choice to terminate or proceed with pregnancies, but should not have the freedom to allow the pregnancy to continue beyond a certain point (TBD) and then abort because they changed their minds about giving birth.\n \n Ironically, I fall in the category of pro-choice/anti-eugenics in contrast to my proposed probabilities statement.

   "Then this is where we differ. I can answer this by repeating what I said in my first post in this thread: The Pro-choice stance is about giving the mother 100% control over her own body, and other moral considerations are not taken into account. At least that's the way I see it, and that's why I support a mother's right to abortion in the early stages.\n \n This is why I don't see a limk between abortion and eugenics; for me, allowing women the right to abortions is not about preventing births, it's about the mother's choice and the issue goes no further in my mind. Simplistic, maybe, but still principled.\n\n If this was a fight over 100% control of one's body, then why don't feminists also include stances supporting the right to take narcotics, sell organs, prostitute themselves and a myriad of other \"individual rights\" to control their own bodies? emoticon_confused \n \n\n As I said, I am undecided on when we should deny a woman an abortion; I think the current limit is 24 weeks? which seems reasonable to me, but I don't have enough scientific knowledge to make an informed decision.\n\n So, you're in favor of killing fetuses as long as the reason for doing so is \"pure\"?

There is a massive difference between killing something before it has developed enough to suffer (either the abortion or its condition) and the genocide of millions of people.\n \n There is also the fact that Hitler's 'racial purity' was complete and utter nonsense, while it is possible to remove disease traits from a family fairly easily - and without resorting to inelegant measures like aborting everything that comes out wrong.\n \n If you were to carry out modern eugenics, rather than the kind that was planned and implemented in the US and mainland europe before we even knew about DNA, abortion wouldn't figure into it at all, nor would genocide or sterilisation. All you need is clinics that can screen sperm and ova, or possibly zygotes for defects before implanting them. Our gene therapy technology would even work at this level without the side effects you get once you extend beyond a few cells.\n \n No need for making anything else illegal, just offer additional child benefits to those who use the clinics to encourage people.

Obviously, I presume there are women out there who do, but I think you know as well as I do that far more women want the right to choose abortion.\n \n Your whole argument stemmed from the fact that you disagreed with me saying that women should have \"100% control over their bodies\", which is interesting, and yet you failed to address the point and dragged the argument further and further off on a tangent.\n \n \nI don't believe in killing fetuses out of convenience for the \"host\". I do believe in abortion to save the life of the mother, however. And, I guess, if you look at abortion as protecting your right to choice and not as your right to commit murder, I can see how you'd have a difficult time deciding that others couldn't have one.\n\n \n Who is comitting the murder? You can say it's the doctor, sure. But the doctor can't just decide to kill someone's unborn baby. The decision is made by the mother, hopefully with the support of the father and her family. Although a potential life is snuffed out, it is not a living person; it is still just part of the mother's body, hence her prerogative. \n I do have a problem with late-term abortions, but I believe the issue of choice is important enough that if the options were \"no abortion for anyone\" or \"abortion for anyone anytime any reason\" I would still go for the latter, although I wouldn't be comfortable with it. \n \n \nPhilosophically, I would agree that the two have differences, but from a historical and practical sense, they are very much intwined. The first pro-abortionists were also eugenicists. The pro-choice movement was created and run by eugenicists. This was no accident.\n \n http://www.scholarscorner.com/ethics/Anti-Semitism.html#1\n\n \n Even if eugenicists(?) were definitely the first people to advocate abortion, this has no relation to the reasons people demand the right to choice of abortion today. \n \n I see giving people the right to choose between birth and abortion as an essentially passive action; you are not forcing them to do anything. Abortions as the result of eugenics policies are forced, and therefore a very active action. Obviously, not all \"passive\" actions are good; far from it, but this is why the two are not linked in terms of morality. To put it more bluntly, making murder legal is not morally equivalent to actually going out and killing people.",

   "But I didn't say that. I said no women that we hear about. I suspect most women who have fallen through society's safety nets to become prostitutes think less about their \"rights to be a hooker\" than the fact that they don't want to be a hooker at all. \n\n They have lots of time to think about \"their rights\" while they're sitting in jails. \n Trust me. \n \n\n You originally said (post #56) that because I believed in women having \"100% control over their bodies\" that I should also consider that they would want to have \"the right to take narcotics, sell organs, prostitute themselves\". \n\n I was attempting to gain a better understanding of just what you meant by \"100% control over their bodies\". I did that by inquiring as to the depth of your conviction about your statement. \n \n\n I pointed out (post #68) that having/aborting a baby was the most significant event for a woman's life compared to your examples.\n \n You responded to this (post #71) by asking if I thought that \"women should only be concerned about \"some\" of their rights to control their own bodies? \". This did not seem to be relevant but I replied anyway.\n\n No, the question was very relevent. You threw out an abstract ideal that women should have 100% control over their own body. 100% includes controll over activities and actions that may or may not be mainstream. You gave a vague response about not knowing any women who want prostitution legalized. Does it matter if there isn't a great outcry if you're concerned with 100% freedom to control your body? Your reply was a pragmatic response to a question about your ideology, not your pragmatism. :xbanghead \n \n\n I said (post #72) that I never mentioned anything about \"should\", and that it's not up to me to decide for women. I then used my comparative example. I will ask the question(s) more clearly this time:\n Is there a large, publicly well-known-of body of women who want the right to choose to have an abortion?\n Is there a large, publicly well-known-of body of women who want the right to be prostitutes?\n Is there a large, publicly well-known-of body of women who want the right to sell their organs?\n Is there a large, publicly well-known-of body of women who want the right to take narcotics?\n\n \n And my reply from a philosophical standpoint is \"Does it matter what the popularity of an issue is when discussing principles? \n \n\n Implying that your comparison to other \"bodily\" rights was unlikely, based on my previous assertion that the choice birth/abortion was more significant to a woman than anything else, and on my observations of the real world.\n \n You countered this (post #74) by asking if I thought that \"No women want the right to be a prostitute?\" as if this had any bearing on my argument. Obviously, I presume there are women out there who do, but I think you know as well as I do that far more women want the right to choose abortion.\n \n Your whole argument stemmed from the fact that you disagreed with me saying that women should have \"100% control over their bodies\", which is interesting, and yet you failed to address the point and dragged the argument further and further off on a tangent.\n\n Quite the contrary, my replies attempted to zero in on just what you meant by 100% control over their own body meant to you. You made a broad \"motherhood statement\" about wnating 100% control but when pressed about just what that entails, you diverted the debate away from answering my inquiry. I'll put them more succinctly for you:\n 1. Does 100% control include the right to take narcotics?\n 2. Does 100% control include the right to sell ones body parts?\n 3. Does 100% control include the right to prostitute oneself?\n 4. Does 100% control include the right to unfettered abortions on demand?\n \n The questions aren't tough, but I fear that your answers will reveal that you \"really\" aren't arguing for 100% control but rather something else. \n \n\n Who is comitting the murder? You can say it's the doctor, sure. But the doctor can't just decide to kill someone's unborn baby. The decision is made by the mother, hopefully with the support of the father and her family. Although a potential life is snuffed out, it is not a living person;\n \n\n In your opinion. Depending on the state, they may or may not be. \n \n\n it is still just part of the mother's body, hence her prerogative. \n \n\n In your opinion.\n \n\n I do have a problem with late-term abortions, but I believe the issue of choice is important enough that if the options were \"no abortion for anyone\" or \"abortion for anyone anytime any reason\" I would still go for the latter, although I wouldn't be comfortable with it. \n\n So, you REALLY aren't arguing for 100% control, but rather somewhat less control. If that's the case, then the argument is over degreee, not absolutes.\n \n\n Even if eugenicists(?) were definitely the first people to advocate abortion, this has no relation to the reasons people demand the right to choice of abortion today. \n\n Even IF? I believe that I've documented that there is no \"if\"; it is fact.:xbanghead \n And, if you'll scroll up to the top of the thread, you'll see that the thread is called \" Eugenics: Who Embraced the Concept?\" Past tense. We have been debating the roots of the abortion movement and how it was pushed by eugenicists. Planned Parenthood can trace its roots directly to the eugenics movement of the early 1900's. \n \n\n I see giving people the right to choose between birth and abortion as an essentially passive action; you are not forcing them to do anything. \n\n There's nothing passive about murder. \n \n\n Abortions as the result of eugenics policies are forced, and therefore a very active action. Obviously, not all \"passive\" actions are good; far from it, but this is why the two are not linked in terms of morality. To put it more bluntly, making murder legal is not morally equivalent to actually going out and killing people.\n\n \n So, passive killing and active killing aren't moral equivalents, in your opinion? For example, it's moral to starve people by not taking an action, but it isn't moral to poison them with tainted food?",

   "Oh my goodness simone, how did you ever guess? I suppose I should just come clean now. I must admit that I am in fact an intrepid time traveler. I have been working closely with Doc Brown to ensure that the flux capacitor of my DeLorian is in proper working condition. Doc has been able to sucessfully maintain the integrity of the capacitor, and it is because of his hard work that I was able to speak with Holmes just yesterday. He told me, \"Cone, I tell you what, the Supreme Court has really blown it on this one. Since the Constitution does not grant the right to abortion, the states may permit it without restriction or prohibit it without exception.\"\n \n Get serious simone. The real reason I said what I did is because it is well known historical fact that Holmes did not adhere to the notion of substantive due process, which is the underlying premise undergirding the judicially constructed constitutional right to abortion.\n\n \n According to Wikipedia the concept of \"substantive due process\" seems a tad vague:\nThe courts have viewed the due process clause, and sometimes other clauses of the Constitution, as embracing those fundamental rights that are \"implicit in ordered liberty.\" Just what these rights are is not always clear, though life, property, and freedom from imprisonment are some of the better established. Some of these rights have long histories or \"are deeply rooted\" in our society. For example, by the way battery has been defined by courts, common law held for centuries that people have the right to refuse medical treatment. Now, even if states changed the definition of battery to exclude unwanted medical procedures, many courts would find that right under the \"liberty\" part of the due process clause.\nAnd, as for Oliver Wendell Holmes and his views on \"substantive due process\":\n \n. . . .Thus, he mostly rejected the doctrine of \"substantive due process\" and the idea that the Constitution imposes certain substantive values on the political process, though he famously made an exception for government action that made him \"puke\" (vomit). This \"puke test\" became the basis for the \"shocks the conscience\" test that Holmes's protege Felix Frankfurter promoted and is currently governing law in certain substantive due process cases. Holmes's judicial philosophy played a major role in shaping American Legal Realism, which emphasized the real-world impact of decisions and de-emphasized legal formalism and theory. . . .\nNow, my question is, do we have witnesses as to the actuality of whether or not Oliver Wendell Holmes puked at all notions of \"substantive due process\"?",
