   "The northeast knows of EZ Pass.\n \n EZ-pass I think is operated by a private company. On the EZ Pass, some states place the time you enter the turnpike and when you exit. \n \n My question to you is, if you enter the turnpike at 4:00 and exit the turnpike at 5:00 and the distance you travelled was 85 miles, clearly, at some point, probably most of the way you were speeding 30 miles over the speed limit. Do you think for those states who \"clock\" you, do they have a reason to send you a ticket in the mail for speeding? Wouldn't you feel violated? Many states still have 55 mph as the speed limit, so if you arrived at your destination 5 minutes earlier, should you too get the ticket. Time is time, speeding is speeding, a ticket is a ticket, all is fair, right? Every speeder should be sent a ticket...right??????\n \n I personally would feel grossly violated, and If I had to take a jab at which state would do it first, the most greedy state I know is NJ!!!",

   "Do states really do that? I live in MD about half an hour out of DC. If you go 55 on those highways, you'll get honked at, passed, and generally be a danger. Most people go at least 70. The other dad I was driving with my dad. He was going 75 and still getting passed.",

   "Do states really do that? .\n\n \n No they don't do it. But there was a \"rumor\" why places like NJ are putting down the times, when you enter a turnpike and when you exit a turnpike.\n \n I personally would not be surprise if the government started to send tickets based on the time slots. NYC with thier cameras at some of the intersections, my god, half the time its dangerous!! If you're approaching the walk crossing and it turns yellow, you have to slam on the breaks and hope no one rear ends you. Even if you just entered into the intersection and the light turns yellow, you're screwed because you're not making it across the intersection before it clicks red, and the camera snaps a photo of your plate and the ticket is in the mail.\n \n I think states are working out the legality of it. Like privacy issue. The targeting of a certain group (EZ-Pass Members), and a few other things I can think of.\n \n This is where I think Government is too much \"big brother\" and watching every move we make. \n \n Think about it though the States are saying, this is proof positive you were speeding, now fork over the dough. What would be your defense in court?\n \n As for the other drivers out there, most are doing well over 70 and 80, and they push you and honk and high beam you because you are doing 70 or 75. I hate those XXXXXX.",
