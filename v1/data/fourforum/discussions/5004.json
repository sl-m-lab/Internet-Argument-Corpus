The post is a parody of Ray Martinez and his vile baseless accustations of racism.\n The bible racially vilifies philistines bush like the bible he is a racist . The Old testament calls Abrahams children the chosen ones. Lots of peopl \n \n \n People like Ray call Duo and I a racist because we don't reject evolution and I beleive Duo is trying to show if Rays Logic is valid then you could use Rays logic to prove all creationists are racists as well as evolutionists so Ray is wrong or his point is irrelevant since we are all racists. \n \n All racism needs is a believe some racial group are clearly superior in non-trivial ways. As soon as some starts believing some people are superior then common sense tells them the children of the superior will be superior. Common sense also tells you something like a little lap dog would not thrive in the wild and become a pest. \n Evolution uses the common sense ideas that the weak do not survive well in the wild and offspring are like their parents. Since people that believe in Eugenics use these common sense ideas they use the word Evolution. This merely shows that common sense ideas can be twisted and people use the \"buzzwords\" of the day.",

There is no such thing as skin \"color\" only varying anounts of melanin.\n Noah's family could have been almost any shade but probably in the olive realm.\n \n The proof of the racism of Darwinism is overwhelming, if you don't believe that you have never read Darwin . Galton or Haeckel . \n \n This is what the evolutionist Steven Gould said:\n \"Haeckel was the chief apostle of evolution in Germany. Nordenskiold (1929) argues that he was even more influential than Darwin in convincing the world of the truth of evolution. ... But, as Gasman argues, Haeckel's greatest influence was, ultimately, in another, tragic direction-national socialism. His evolutionary racism; his call to the German people for racial purity and unflinching devotion to a \"just\" state; his belief that harsh, inexorable laws of evolution ruled human civilization and nature alike, conferring upon favored races the right to dominate others; the irrational mysticism that had always stood in strange communion with his brave words about objective science-all contributed to the rise of Nazism. The Monist League that he had founded and led, though it included a wing of pacifists and leftists, made a comfortable transition to active support for Hitler.\" (Gould, Stephen J. [Professor of Zoology and Geology, Harvard University], \"Ontogeny and Phylogeny,\" Belknap Press: Cambridge MA, 1977, pp.77-78).\n \n Rose M.R. [Professor of Evolutionary Biology, University of California, Irvine said this:\n \n The case for Darwinism cannot be based on any edification that is supposed to come from its truths. Through eugenics, Darwinism was a bad influence on Nazism, one of the greatest killers in world history. Darwinism probably contributed to the upsurge of racism in the latter part of the nineteenth century, and thus it helped foment twentieth-century racism generally. Darwinism was also used to exacerbate the neglect of the poor in the nineteenth century. All things considered, Darwinism has had many regrettable, and sometimes actually vicious, effects on the social climate of the modern world. Modern Darwinism does not offer any guarantee of unending progress. It is understandable that so many hate Darwin and Darwinism. It is often a bitter burden to live with Darwinism and its implications. Unlike so many doctrines, religions, and ideologies, it certainly isn't intellectual opium. No one can make a case for Darwinism based on moral hygiene.\" (Rose M.R. [Professor of Evolutionary Biology, University of California, Irvine], \"Darwin's Spectre: Evolutionary Biology in the Modern World,\" [1998], Princeton University Press: Princeton NJ, 2000, Third printing, p.210).
