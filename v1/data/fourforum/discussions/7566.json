If you are interested...look it up....if not, then don't worry about it.\n\n \n I'm a theoretical physics and maths major, I know pretty well what the theory of relativity is. I also know that, under most conditions, its predictions are accurate (the special in particular is amazingly accurate, and unified with QM; it's the general that causes trouble). I also think that any physics teacher who brushed over relativity as if it may or may not be true is failing in their responsibilities. It may be necessary to restrict the parameters in which relativity is used, as it has been with newtonian mechanics, but it still makes valid predictions, so is a valid theory.

First of all you must put time into perspective. Evolution happens over millions of years, we're not going to see something evolve before our eyes. I have a theory. Balding. Balding is a dominant, muted gene, and in 35 million years we'll all be bald. We'll still be men and women, but hairless men and women, assuming a comet doesn't kill us first. Will we be taller? Depends on the oxygen in the air. The dinosaurs had about 10% oxygen in the air via carbon testing on the sea floor, as if they know, but assuming they did, I read our oxygen is again depleting, so in \"theory\" we should be getting taller, but I swear I think we are shrinking as a species. emoticon_cry",
