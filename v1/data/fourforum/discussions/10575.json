   "Many of our resident deniers have been keen to claim there is no connection between religion and gay-bashing, or homophobia. Well, it just ain't so. The Pew Trust earlier last month came out with another of its surveys on global attitudes:\n \n Pew Global Attitudes Project\n \n It's pretty comprehensive (full PDF file here), and among the attitudes surveyed were those towards religion and homosexuality.\n \n In one table (p33 of the PDF file), they listed the proportion of respondents from each country surveyed who said that belief in god was essential to being a moral person. This can be regarded as a rough measure of religiosity. In another (p35), they listed the proportion who rejected homosexuality. While they didn't cross-correlate these, I did, and the regression analysis was very telling.\n \n Slope = 0.86, r-squared = 0.60 \n \n This is a very strong correlation for social trends, suggesting that intensity of religious belief is strongly associated with homophobia. Whether religion is in part a cause of homophobia, or whether some common factor fuels both, can't be answered by the data, but the correlation deserves an explanation.\n \n Other tidbits in the survey were also very interesting. For example, there is a strong correlation between a nation's wealth and its degree of religiosity. There are several exceptions, the US being one of them, as it is a far more religiose nation than one would expect from its economy. This sets it among third world, Islamic and Asian nations, rather than Western ones, on this score.",

The religions get to \"throw stones\" at a small group who are doing something that they (sometimes) have no desire themselves to do.\n Unlike adultery or divorce or woman's equality or love of money, homosexuality is easy to marginalize because it's not a \"popular\" sin based on the per capita people who have a desire to violate that \"sin\".\n \n Jesus never said a word against homosexuals, but he did make several condemning statements regarding the rich.

   "And note, the correlation I pointed to is between religiosity and homophobia. If religion (or at least some specific form of religion) is a cause of homophobia (it doesn't have to be the sole cause), then one would expect that the greater the intensity of religious belief, the greater the perceived offensiveness of homosexuality. Which is what we observe -- a corresponding, almost 1:1 increase in religiosity and anti-gay bigotry. Now, admittedly there's a fair amount of scatter in the data, and some outliers, but for a social phenomenon, the correlation is uncanny.\n \n Now countries with majority religious beliefs, but less intense ones, are less homophobic, but one can argue they are also less religious. Spain, for example, used to be considered a Catholic country, and indeed the large majority of its population is Catholic, but it has one of the lowest incidences of both religiosity and homophobia, and is high on the Vatican scheiss-list for its legalisation of gay marriage despite strenuous interference from that church.\n \n Are the Spanish still \"real\" Catholics, or have they currently rejected religiosity of the Vatican kind?

Only their own sexual orientation is relevant to them, and that is approved of, in straight cases, by their religion so they have no need to wonder about it. \n \n However, a substantial proportion of religious believers (at least in the US) seem to define themselves these days by their fervent opposition to homosexuality as the source of all evil that isn't caused by Darwinism. They are far more vocal and active than the silent alleged majority that it is said does not share their extremism. Well, we all know what silence connotes when there is an opportunity to speak, and it is not taken.\n \n There are sins of omission as well commission, and religion is perfectly capable of both.

Are people homophobic because they believe religious doctrine, or are people taught both to believe religious doctrine and to be homophobic, and do they then look for justification in religious doctrine for the homophobia they have been taught? \n\n \n There are other possibilities as well. For example, homophobia might result from some innate factor -- for example, it might be a form of xenophobia, or fear of difference and nonconformity -- which is then exacerbated by religion which exploits fear to manipulate a population.\n \n Still, even if homophobia is a manifestation of some innate aversion, it can still be educated away. Homophobes have been known to change their opinions and attitudes, so there has to be some cultural influence at work in the direction xenophobia points towards, but I've never known anyone change their sexual orientation!\n \n \nI think, and this is just speculation here, that the roots of homophobia lie in patriarchy, or in male domination and in the perpetuation of rigid gender roles based on male domination.

Although it scores very low on the Pew's measurement of religiosity (it's a secular nation without much in the way of traditional Western religious practice), it has a much higher index of homophobia than would be expected from the correlation. It's a real outlier, but there's no direct religious cause that's obvious.\n \n However, to speculate a bit further, China is a country with a long traditional respect for authority and ancestry, for the importance of family and especially the role of male family elders. If it is indeed patriarchy and family concerns that fuel negative attitudes towards homosexuality, then religion as such is not a necessary social factor in homophobia (indeed, we agree that not all religious believers or religions are homophobic). However, that wouldn't mean that religion was never a contributory factor, nor even that it was not a common factor, just that it is not sufficient in itself, nor exclusive to other factors.\n \n One could, I suppose, try to highlight those aspects of religion that mitigate homophobia, as some Christian churches do, but that doesn't really absolve religion from involvement in how homophobia is made manifest.",

   "When i suggest there may be an innate factor in homophobia, I do not, of course, mean there is a 'gene for' it, nor that homophobia is inevitably and ineluctably programmed into people. I mean there may be some psychological template, based on some evolutionary or biological need, upon which it is based.\n \n I can think of two possibilities, which may be related. First, growing children are usually very shy of strangers and new situations, at least over a certain range of ages. This may be a built-in aversion designed to keep kids close to parents who are more reliable protectors. Fear of the unknown is no bad survival strategy, in general, though it can also be pathological and debilitating in many cases. Maybe this fear persists into adulthood disproportionately in some cases.\n \n Second, humans and animals in general are very sensitive to conventional behaviour among the animals they associate with routinely. By conventional, I really just mean habitual or usual. Deviations from it, for example in sickness or dementia, are treated with extreme and sometimes violent suspicion. I've observed this aversion and fear behaviour in cats living in a group home when one gets ill or has to visit the vet, and I've noted that many people are perversely averse to dealing with sick and disabled humans, or even noticing they exist. It's just not usual or normal, and they don't know what to expect or what might come of it. Again, this is no bad survival strategy in general, but can be pathological.\n \n It's certainly plausible to me that homophobia might be built on such a biological template, though I wouldn't dispute the key role that culture plays in its manifestation -- culture including religion, which can make things better or worse, usually worse. I have no doubt that homophobes cannot really control any feelings of aversion they may have to gay human beings, any more than inveterate racists can control their feelings of aversion to people of a different skin colour.\n \n That doesn't mean it's acceptable behaviour in a civilised society, nor that cultural (i.e. mostly religious) influences have nothing to do with it. They can and should control how they act on such feelings.",

Ferguson, the state of Louisiana argued that the train segregation law was needed to prevent disorder. Whites also claimed often that African Americans were inherently lustful and would ravage white women and created a mulatto race if the states did not enact laws to separate the races and control African Americans.\n \n The arguments in support of race discrimination were strikingly similar to the arguments that people muster today in support of discrimination against gay people.",

   "When i suggest there may be an innate factor in homophobia, I do not, of course, mean there is a 'gene for' it, nor that homophobia is inevitably and ineluctably programmed into people. I mean there may be some psychological template, based on some evolutionary or biological need, upon which it is based.\n \n I can think of two possibilities, which may be related. First, growing children are usually very shy of strangers and new situations, at least over a certain range of ages. This may be a built-in aversion designed to keep kids close to parents who are more reliable protectors. Fear of the unknown is no bad survival strategy, in general, though it can also be pathological and debilitating in many cases. Maybe this fear persists into adulthood disproportionately in some cases.\n \n Second, humans and animals in general are very sensitive to conventional behaviour among the animals they associate with routinely. By conventional, I really just mean habitual or usual. Deviations from it, for example in sickness or dementia, are treated with extreme and sometimes violent suspicion. I've observed this aversion and fear behaviour in cats living in a group home when one gets ill or has to visit the vet, and I've noted that many people are perversely averse to dealing with sick and disabled humans, or even noticing they exist. It's just not usual or normal, and they don't know what to expect or what might come of it. Again, this is no bad survival strategy in general, but can be pathological.\n \n It's certainly plausible to me that homophobia might be built on such a biological template\n\n \n I missed this post earlier. I've commented on this issue before, and I think I once even started a thread on it. I think the idea that the \"ick-factor\" is built-in is very plausible. Heck, such aversion may even be genetic. Much of human-kind's evolution has been over what it takes to survive, naturally, and there's nothing pertaining to homosexuality that would propagate the human species naturally. As wide-spread as the aversion to same-gender relationships are, it could very well be that it is not solely due to socialistic influences. \n \n The thing is, people who are gay seem to have a sort of 'ick-factor' toward opposite-gender relationships as well, sometimes. At least in terms of the idea of it being a major turn-off. It feels unnatural to a gay person because it IS unnatural. So then why should it not be the same way--the other way around--for the straight person? So I agree with you, there probably is an innate factor for homophobia at least in some cases.

So I agree with you, there probably is an innate factor for homophobia at least in some cases. This is all speculative to some degree, but it makes sense.\n\n \n I think I disagree with you a bit here. As heterosexuals have and \"ick\" factor towards same-sex sexual relations, the same is true for some homosexuals towards having sex with a member of the opposite sex. However, that being said, homosexuals mostly do not place the \"ick\" factor on heterosexual relations because most of us were raised by heterosexual parents. As homosexuality is \"Normal\" for us, so is heterosexuality.\n \n I think we understand heterosexual relationships better than heterosexuals understand our relationships because heterosexual relations were our first lesson in relationships. \n \n Personally, I don't have an \"ick\" factor when I think of hetero's having sex. I just think it's part of life. Just like when I have sex with my husband is a part of life. What I do behind closed doors is only my business, as it should be.\n \n Many heterosexuals are just not accepting of gay relationships on both the sexual and non-sexual level. That is the crux of the problem we have. I have no clue what the solution to that problem is. Because, obviously, neither heterosexuals nor homosexuals are ever going away. We will always be intertwined in this world... in or out of the closet. I guess that's the reason we are on this board!",

Yeah, yeah, I know plausible doesn't equate to certainty--as we've both now said, we're discussing speculatively at this point.\n\n \n Well... there is no question that biology favours sex for propagating genes. And that necessarily means opposite sex, as far as reproduction is concerned. Still, in social groups, there may well be value to having organisms who help the propagators, without propagating themselves. After all, they do share most of their genes. There are theories of kin selection and reciprocal altruism, etc., that might apply to homosexuality. (However, there's no convincing evidence whether they do or don't.) Homosexuality might also be linked to some other reproductive trait, perhaps working through group selection. All this is speculative, however, I just mention it to show that adaptationist theories do not exclude homosexuality.\n \n As for the \"ick-factor\", well, it doesn't apply to most gays -- except, notably, those gays most in thrall to religion. And it doesn't need to apply to straights at all. Straight people aren't going to have gay sex sex so long as they can have straight sex. It's like ships that pass in the night. I don't think one need be repulsed by gay sex if one is attracted to straight sex. In any case, it only takes one straight sex encounter to get a female pregnant. Even if animals were 99% homosexual, that 1% would be enough to keep the population going.\n \n So I'm not particularly convinced that homophobia is in itself adaptive. Over evolutionary history, people breed more than they can comfortably raise, anyway, as do all animals. If 99% of sexual encounters were gay, I doubt it would make much difference to population growth. As it is, most sexual encounters between men and women do not result in pregnancy.\n \n \nI just mean social environment.\n\n \n I think that social environment can either reinforce or mitigate homophobia.

These tests are the means by which the Supreme Court balances the rights being protected by the amendment against the interests of the states.

As former Chief Justice John Marshall said, it is the duty of the Court to say what the law is. \n \n If you are looking to the intent of the framers, you cannot claim that the Supreme Court before the Carolene Products case interpreted the 14th amendment as its framers intended. Indeed, the Court mostly did the opposite, interpreting the amendment to protect not the rights of the freed slaves or of other individuals, but to protect business corporations from government regulation. The Supreme Court also interpreted the 14th amendment to give states latitude to enact segregation laws. \n \n In developing a standard by which to protect real human beings from the denial of rights by the states, the Supreme Court, beginning in 1938 with Footnote 4 in the Carolene Products Case, took a giant step in the direction toward what the framers of the 14th amendment intended, which was to protect individual rights from government abrogation. The Carolene Products case, with its famous Footnote 4, was the turning point for the Supreme Court in the direction of interpreting the 14th amendment to protect individual liberties, which is what the framers of the 14th amendment most certainly intended in crafting it.",

That would enable some religious groups to impose their morals on everyone else. And if we are to interpret the constitution as making a presumption of liberty, then individuals should be free to do that which does not harm other people. A state's secular purpose in enacting a law is surely to protect people from harm and to maintain order and peace for the public good. If there is no clear public good, and instead a law is rooted only in the beliefs or morals of a particular religion, then it should not be permitted to become law. Enacting a particular religion's morals into law would quite clearly violate the establishment clause, by imposing a particular set of religious beliefs on everyone through the state. To the extent that religious morals overlap with a broader secular purpose in enacting a law, that's fine. But there has to be a purpose beyond the beliefs about morality of a particular religion.\n \n These points are made by the Supreme Court in the Lemon test, which is a test adopted by the Court to determine when a state law violates the establishment clause and is unconstitutional.

You didn't realize it came from the 14th amendment.\nYou are grasping at straws. The 14th amendment is part of the constitution. When you amend the constitution, that amendment is now a part of it. To say \"the original understanding of the constitution\" is to say \"the meaning of the document when adopted\". In the case of the 14th amendment it was several years after the constitution was ratified. Furthermore, the first 10 amendments were not part of the \"original constitution\" as you eluded to earlier (the post where you claimed I didn't know what I was talking about). They were not ratified until 3 years (or so) after the constitution was ratified. Original understanding does not equal original document. Surely given the numerous times I have discussed the constitution on these forums (and some with you), you would remember this.\n \n I feel like the mercy rule should apply to you at some point.",

   "It could, IF it weren't a case of one being a granting of freedom, and other a restriction of freedom (at least in terms of the way people want religion out of govt.), and therefore your comparison is apples and oranges.\n\n Where in the 1st amendment does it establish what you describe as a relevant distinction?\n \n It's apples and apples.\n The EXACT SAME PHRASE precedes both portions of the 1st amendment.\n \n The 1st amendment: \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech...\"\n \n Grammatically parsed:\n 1) Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion\n 2) Congress shall make no law prohibiting the free exercise thereof\n 3) Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech\n \n It is logical that if the \"Congress shall make no law\" portion is to be strictly interpreted for one part of the first amendment, it should be strictly interpreted for all.\n I know of no legal precedent which establishes the distinction you wish to imply, nor is that a logical inference from the first amendment wording.\n \n We've got apples and apples, and you want to interject an orange where it doesn't belong.\n \n \n \nSaying the govt. shouldn't restrict the press is different than saying religion shouldn't get into govt.

The point here is that with religion however, we DON'T.\n\n You keep pulling the same lame dodge, and it gets REALLY old.\n Somebody points out a flaw in your thinking.\n You make some feeble dodge (or none at all), and then you insist that your \"point\" has not been acknowledged.\n \n The \"point\" is that there is a FLAW in your thinking.\n If we interpret it STRICTLY to apply only to \"congressional laws\", then it should be done for every part of the first amendment.\n Cause THAT is what is ACTUALLY SAID in the first amendment.\n \n Repeatedly, the anti-gay side of the fence refuses to acknowledge the consequences of their restrictive interpretations of the constitution.\n \n The point is that if we only prohibited \"congressional laws\", then we would open the door to all sorts of abuse that is currently prohibited.\n Suppose the president wanted to restrict free speech. Is that a \"congressional law\"? No? I guess it's okay then.\n \n Our foundi7ng fathers did NOT intend for ONLY congress to be prohibited from restricting free speech in legislative form.\n Our founding fathers did NOT intend for ONLY congressional legislation establishment of \"religion\" as prohibited.\n \n \n \nWhen fanatics act as though it's some violation of the 1st amendment for a judge to put 10 verses of the Bible on the wall that have enormous historical value in terms of law, they going by something the 1st amendment doesn't say, not what it does.\n\n 1) As long as other historical / religious representations are present, I have no problem.\n When the item in question is solitary, with only one religion presented, then it's obviously a lot more than just \"historical value in terms of law\".\n It's often an attempt for Christians to get governmental endorsement / establishment of their religion.\n Trying to dress up the pig and putting lipstick on it doesn't make it any less of a pig.\n \n 2) I know there is at least one biblical representation of law, incorporated into an ACTUAL HISTORICAL REPRESENTATION of law including multiple facets of law history.\n That's fine.\n It's when judges decide to put up stone monuments of the ten commandments with nothing else around that the problem is present.\n \n 3) Considering you are chiming in with people who demand a STRICT interpretation of the Constitution, perhaps you'd be able to supply the constitutional distinction for your \"apples and oranges\" distinction?\n Or is that just something you pulled our your arse?",

I asked you to provide evidence of this and yet none.\n\n Quote me.\n \n \n \nSo \"decide meaning\" now means \"explain or tell meaning\"?\n\n At times, it is downright baffling how little thought goes into your post.\n Pray tell, what significant difference IN FUNCTION do you see between \"decide meaning\" and \"explain or tell meaning\" by which SCOTUS could not \"interpret\" the constitution as I describe???\n \n Let me guess.\n Yet another question avoided?\n \n \n \nTell me, if I decide what shirt to wear tomorrow does that mean I am also explaining what shirt I will wear tomorrow? \n Haha, too easy.\n\n No. Too stupid.\n Do you have even a couple of brain cells to rub together that the AUTHORITY TO DECIDE is the huge significant aspect in all that?\n \n They have the AUTHORITY to DECIDE what shirt will be worn tomorrow.\n And then they \"explain\" to others what shirt will be worn.\n \n Whether or not \"explaining\" is included in \"interpret\" is irrelevant.\n You have already admitted that they have the authority TO DECIDE what shirt should be worn.\n Actually \"explaining\" it is not forbidden, and for you to quibble that \"interpret\" does not include \"explain\" is downright inane!\n \n Does anything forbid them from explaining what they \"decide\"?\n Is it not an obvious consequence of \"deciding\" something that the CONCLUSION plays out to make it so?\n \n In your example, SCOTUS decides on a shirt to be worn tomorrow.\n By your logic, it would be like quibbling over whether or not the person gets to put on that shirt. That \"deciding\" does not include actually putting it on.\n \n My gawd man. Try and THINK before you open your mouth.\n \n \n \nIn any event, the court's job is to tell the meaning of, so I guess I am glad you posted that. When you tell meaning of it generally means that the meaning is already established and there is no need to determine what the meaning should be. \n\n No.\n \"When you tell meaning\" it does not generally mean that \"meaning is already established\".\n If all the ramifications of the meaning were already established, what point would there be in the courts re-stating it???\n \n By your ideals, SCOTUS would get up in the morning, tell the court listeners what they already knew, and that's it.\n How ridiculous!\n \n \n \nI'd hope Congress would know the meaning of what they wrote. The very fact that they decide the language means they decide meaning.\n In any event, this is a moot point.\n\n emoticon_rolleyes \n Pointless quibbling over nothing.\n SCOTUS interprets. Period.\n SCOTUS is the FINAL WORD on interpretation. Period.\n \n Whether or not you can find some mundane way to claim that somebody else can \"interpret\" is irrelevant.\n \n \n \nThe only difference is that the 5th amendment only applies to federal while the 14th only applies to the states (due process clause that is). Huge difference? Well, that depends on what you think is huge.\n\n I swear. It's like you haven't a clue, and you insist on telling the world, except you think you're being profound.\n \n Suppose John and Jim beat up Gary every day.\n A teacher comes along and passes a rule which states that John cannot beat Gary up.\n Jim still can...\n Might be marginally helpful for Gary, but Gary still gets beaten up.\n Now the teacher comes along and passes another rule which states that Gary has the right to not get beaten up.\n Ergo, preventing Jim from beating Gary up.\n \n The second rule prevents Gary from getting beaten up.\n Just like the 14th amendment makes the transition from the states being capable of violating our rights, to NO government being able to violate our rights.\n \n That's pretty damn significant, whether you are capable of realizing it or not.\n Maybe you can't because you want to allow Jim to beat Gary up... emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \n \nWhere you going to tell me the court case you quoted or not?\n\n I will not requote for you.\n You were too damn lazy to read and think the first time.\n Go back and find where I stated it the first time.\n \n Until then, I will continue to point out your foolishness....\n \n And here, ladies and gentlemen, we have a PERFECT example of how Steeeeve just talks out of his arse.\n \n The background is this. Steeeeve is insisting that we have to talk about the \"living Constitution\" issue, because he claims that my argument on the first amendment USES the \"living Constitution\" approach.\n And I asked him quite simply how.\n And here, he demonstrates that he hasn't a clue as to what I ACTUALLY said which supposedly makes my approach to the interpretation a \"living Constitution\" approach. \n \n \n \nThen how is saying \"original understanding of the constitution\" not inclusive of the 14th amendment if the 14th amendment is in the constitution?\n\n Because the 14th amendment did not exist at the time of the \"original understanding of the Constitution\".\n \n By your skewed attempt to rework the English language, to ignore what you ACTUALLY said which was in error, if we adopted another amendment tomorrow, then you would start calling it the \"original understanding of the constitution\"...\n Over 200 years after the constitution was adopted, you would still be saying \"original understanding of the constitution\". emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \n \nI believe I did answer it and you quoted the answer. \n\n Care to explain what your answer actually was?\n \n \n \nNo, what I meant was \"I don't think the 14th amendment Due Process Clause incorporates any amendment to the states\".\n\n You don't think...\n The 14th amendment DOES INCLUDE requirements upon the states' legislation.\n Whether you are prepared to accept that fact is entirely irrelevant.",

I never claimed I was quoting the portion that was necessary there.\n I started at the beginning of the 14th amendment not because that was the applicable section, but because you demonstrated you were so clueless as to the contents of the 14th amendment that I felt you needed to start at the beginning.\nThat's not even the beginning of the amendment! The beginning of the amendment reads \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they resides\" and not \"No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States\".\n \n Please continue the excuses though...they are priceless.\n \n \nOnce again, you insist on avoiding the TOPICAL issues while fixating on something you think you might have a hope at significance on...\nYet you did the same thing regarding something I said.... why the double standard?\n \n Lets put these next two quotes back to back to see irony at its finest\n \nInstead, you're arguing about something COMPLETELY non-topical.\n\n \n \nYou not using the phrase \"original constitution\" does not mean that your flaw is not still present.\n\n \n Now, why is it that I am off topic when showing your true mistake but it is on-topic when we discuss some crazy notion you came up with?\n \n \nSuppose John had a Ford Taurus.\n And then John added a fifth wheel to the Ford Taurus, which added stability.\n And then you came along and stated that you rejected the idea of added stability, because it has no basis in the original understanding of the car.\n \n The flaw in your pretend argument being that the fifth wheel has no basis in the \"original understanding of the car\". It's something John ADDED.\nYour analogy makes no sense. There is no original understanding of a car...\n \n If I said \"you have a wrong understanding of the constitution\" then you would think of the entire constitution including the 14th amendment would you not? The fact that I added \"original\" to qualify the term understanding (since there is understanding beyond original) then this does not negate what I refer to.\n \n \n\n No matter how often you try to re-work what your original English actually meant, it comes down to one fundamental flaw.\n The 14th amendment WAS NOT in the \"original understanding of the constitution\" because the 14th amendment WAS NOT PRESENT in the original understanding of the constitution.\nOk, you apparently just have no idea what original understanding means. I guess I should have known.\n \n The \"original understanding of the constitution\" is not the object in my sentence. I refer to constitution which the 14th amendment is apart of. The 14th amendment does have original understanding.\n \n \n \n \nQuote me.\nWill do\n And to answer your question, it's obviously because some bigots were trying to side-step the constitution.\n\n \nPray tell, what significant difference IN FUNCTION do you see between \"decide meaning\" and \"explain or tell meaning\" by which SCOTUS could not \"interpret\" the constitution as I describe???\nOne is a determination between two or more options while the other is to say a pre-determined meaning.\n \n \n \nWhether or not \"explaining\" is included in \"interpret\" is irrelevant.\n You have already admitted that they have the authority TO DECIDE what shirt should be worn.\nI did? I believe I stated the courts don't get to decide meaning.\n \n \nActually \"explaining\" it is not forbidden, and for you to quibble that \"interpret\" does not include \"explain\" is downright inane!\nActually I said interpret does not include decide.

You seem to think it does.\n \n \n \n \n \nNo.\n \"When you tell meaning\" it does not generally mean that \"meaning is already established\".\n If all the ramifications of the meaning were already established, what point would there be in the courts re-stating it???\nTo apply it to specific scenarios of course. For example a law that says the federal government an levy an income tax would have a certain meaning for income. Now if a case comes up where a person won a lawsuit then an issue could come up about whether or not that meaning applies to the money awarded. Of course some scenarios are easier than others. The other alternative to this would be that the meaning is not known and if this is the case then how would we ever know what the law says unless the court told us and it changes no further afterwards?\n \n \nBy your ideals, SCOTUS would get up in the morning, tell the court listeners what they already knew, and that's it.\n How ridiculous!\nAs opposed to the listeners having no idea what the law says? I'd rather have a system that lets me know what the law means.\n \n \nWhether or not you can find some mundane way to claim that somebody else can \"interpret\" is irrelevant.\nYou just don't know what the word interpret means\n \n \nThe second rule prevents Gary from getting beaten up.\n Just like the 14th amendment makes the transition from the states being capable of violating our rights, to NO government being able to violate our rights.\nThe 14th amendment only added a due process clause to the states. That only protects a right to due process within the states...no more no less.\n \n \nBecause the 14th amendment did not exist at the time of the \"original understanding of the Constitution\".\nWhat? There was no one time of the \"original understanding of the Constitution\". Do you think there was some get-together that decided all at once what the \"original understanding of the constitution\" should be?

This isn't a hard concept but I love how you get mad about things that are off topic....oh wait.\n \n \nCare to explain what your answer actually was?\nSure. You asked what the date was when I referred to \"date adopted\". My answer was that it depends on the provision.

It's like you can't step around here without hitting a mine...\n \n \n \nActually I said interpret does not include decide. Try reading my posts.\n\n And that argument was rejected as obviously false.\n To be able to explain something you have to obviously make a decision as to what that \"something\" is in the first place...\n \n A decision process is obviously made in interpretation.\n A pity you can't come to realize that...\n \n \n [quote=Steeeeve[My example is to only state that \"explain\" does not equal \"decide\".

You only repeat what you think.\n Your position is destroyed by logic, yet you reply with no real logic of your own. You only repeat what you think.\n Your position is destroyed by the dictionary, yet you reply with no dictionary quotes of your own. You only repeat what you think.\n \n My position is that \"interpret\" logically requires decision.\n If I were to interpret art, and figure out whether or not it was good art or bad art, it would require a decision.\n If I were to interpret a foreign language, I would have to decide on the proper context of the words for my explanation.\n \n Interpretation logically requires a decision.\n In your supposed world, \"interpretation\" would just mean that the people involved repeat already known facts.

There was no one time of the \"original understanding of the Constitution\".[/quote]\n And thus you just destroyed the importance of your phrase, making it COMPLETELY MEANINGLESS...\n Bravo Steeeeve.\n The \"phyrric victory\" approach for you then, eh?\n \n \n \nDo you think there was some get-together that decided all at once what the \"original understanding of the constitution\" should be? Original understanding comes at the time of adoption for each provision.\n\n ROFLMAO!!!\n So NOT ONLY do you destroy the relevance of your comment, you THEN give a relevance to the comment you SHOULD HAVE made...\n (But then again, you've already attempted to destroy the possibility for the comment you SHOULD HAVE made, so you're just poking holes in your own sinking ship at this stage...)\n \n Your original statement should have been talking about the \"original understanding of the 14th amendment\". Phyllis even tried to throw you a life vest, but you ignored it.\n \n But Bravo for finally admitting that your statement has no meaning in the context of what you were trying to establish.\n Even if you won't admit that's what you just showed...\n \n \n \nRight, because the original understanding of that provision would be the understanding of that amendment tomorrow.\n\n And interesting how you don't try to repeat your previously demonstrated FLAWED PHRASE in your summation here.\n You don't try to claim \"original interpretation of the constitution\" when you REFERENCE THE NEWLY CREATED PROVISION...\n \n Instead, you just created a DIFFERENT phrase...\n Further demonstrating that not even you really use English the way you want to claim you're abusing it...\n \n \n \nSure. You asked what the date was when I referred to \"date adopted\". My answer was that it depends on the provision. The means for the original constitution it was when ratified but for the amendments it was when each of those were ratified which were all after the fact.\n\n So again, if I were to say \"original interpretation of the constitution\", what date would that be?\n Can't seem to admit how completely meaningless your claim is, can you...\n \n \n \nThe 14th amendment requires the states to recognize citizens (as defined) within their state, requires them not to \"enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States\", and grant due process to any person within its jurisdiction....at least these are the requirements in the first paragraph. No of those require the first 10 amendments to incorporated.\n\n Who the heck said anything about the first 10 amendments requiring to be incorporated?",

   "It was the beginning of the relevant sentence.\n Your question has been asked and answered.\n Considering how often you refuse to answer simple questions about your own OPINION on the issue, I'm not going to entertain this mindless #### of yours to side-track to a non-point anymore...\nI find it very odd that you only quote the privileges and immunities clause as defense for incorporation yet sit here and tell me you really knew it was the due process clause. Too prideful to admit a mistake. A shame.\n \n \nShowing how YOU are NOT an expert is completely topical to that end.\n Showing how YOU do NOT understand even the basics of the constitution demonstrates that we cannot even take you at your own word as a credible witness on constitutional interpretation.\nyet this is what I am doing when you don't even know how the first amendment (and others) was applied to the states. At least what I said was accurate...what you said was completely wrong. \n \n You apply a double standard for getting \"side-tracked\" and yet seem ok with this?\n \n \nUnlike you, others don't even need to take me as an \"expert\". \nNo one will ever claim you are an expert.\n \n \nShowing that you are clueless on constitutional interpretation is entirely topical.\nBut showing your clueless is not topical? Very nice double standard you got there. \n \n \nThe original design, sold new to the customer by the dealer.\n But, if you want to go another step, there is no \"original interpretation of the constitution\" which includes the 14th amendment, since the 14th amendment was not in the original interpretation.\nNothing is in an original interpretation. Like I said, there wasn't a counsel that sat down and decided this. Original interpretation of the constitution refers to the original interpretation of the provision in the constitution. \n \n Since you are not able to grasp this concept I doubt this example will do anything to convince you but here it goes...\n \n An Originalist inquiry into the original meaning of the Constitution\n \n This is a line from the Original meaning article of Wikipedia. I assume the person that wrote that doesn't know what he/she is talking about either. \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_meaning\n \n In fact just type in \"Original interpretation (or meaning) of the constitution\" into google and see how many times it actually comes up.\n \n I'm sorry you don't know what the term means but now you do.\n \n \nEarlier I asked you a question which you predictably dodged...\n WHAT DATE would this \"original interpretation of the constitution\" be????\nI've actually answered it about 3 times now. Not only that, you actually quoted it and responded in your post. So I will address this later on.\n \n \nYes. It does.\n Because the 14th amendment is not in the original understanding of the constitution.\nAre you really that dense? What does original refer to? You seem to think constitution. I say it refers to understanding. Original understanding of what? The constitution. The constitution consists of the 14th amendment. So when one says the \"original understanding of the constitution\" it means the meaning given to each provision at the time ratified. This isn't rocket science, it's just knowing what constitutional theories are out there. The fact that you are even debating this is idiotic.\n \n\n The rabbit hole goes even deeper...\n So the 14th amendment does not have an original understanding, in your opinion...\n Does the 1st amendment have an original understanding?\n Does the 5th amendment have an original understanding?\nLets see what I wrote (from what you quoted): \"The 14th amendment does have original understanding.\"\n \n Now tell me how you got \"14th amendment does not have an original understanding\" out of that?\n \n \nand of course, NONE of that distinction can be found anywhere in the definition.\n Again, you give multiple examples of how you are not to be trusted with interpreting.\n When convenient, you just make junk up that has no basis in the English language. You add things to definitions which are not present.\nIn all fairness, I'm not the one that thinks decide means the same thing as say or tell.\n \n \nToo late.\n The power to interpret gives them that power.\n It's an English reality...\nIts an English reality that interpret means decide? Not even the definitions you provided state this. \n \n \n \nOh wait. You just said there was no original understanding of the 14th amendment...\nI did? Please quote this.\n \n \nWow man. It's like you can't step around here without hitting a mine...\nIt is indeed hard to not step on a mind your disillusion fantasy world.\n \n \nAnd that argument was rejected as obviously false.\n To be able to explain something you have to obviously make a decision as to what that \"something\" is in the first place...\n \n A decision process is obviously made in interpretation.\n A pity you can't come to realize that...\nA decision process is not made in interpreting meaning because the courts aren't there to decide meaning. Decide does not equal interpret in any language. \n \n \nYour position is destroyed by the dictionary, yet you reply with no dictionary quotes of your own. You only repeat what you think.\nI don't even need to reply with dictionary quotes of my own. Your definitions support my position very nicely. \n \n Like you quoted: \"interpret: 1 : to explain or tell the meaning of\"\n Please tell me how \"to explain or tell the meaning of\" includes decide?\n \n \nMy position is that \"interpret\" logically requires decision.\nAnd you are wrong. What is there to decide when interpreting? \n \n \nIf I were to interpret art, and figure out whether or not it was good art or bad art, it would require a decision.\nHaha, are you serious? You can't add on and expect me not to catch it. You have an \"or\" in your sentence. A decision is required for the second statement but not the first. If you interpret art you do not have to make a decision about anything as there are no two options during this exercise. When you add, interpret to find meaning so you can make a decision on good or bad then of course you make a decision but this is not the point. If you were to already say the art is good then when you interpret it for someone else then you are not making a decision. A judge, in no question, has to make a decision on the case but that the decision is not based on what the meaning is but whether or not the meaning applies to the facts of the case. \n \n \nIf I were to interpret a foreign language, I would have to decide on the proper context of the words for my explanation.\nYou don't really decide this, you only figure it out. The difference is that you really don't get to pick as there already is a correct answer to the question. If an interpretor hears in English \"I like cake\" then there is no decision regarding meaning that needs to be made when converting this to Spanish. The meaning is very clear (I like cake). \n \n \nYour pretense of \"interpret\" means a regurgitation of facts which are already known.\nIndeed it does. \n \n \nAnd all you do is repeat your conjured boundaries on \"interpret\" to ignore logic and the dictionary.\nThe dictionary refers to it as \"explaining\". Explaining requires no decision.\n \n \nAgain, meaningless.\n If the law already stated the precise definition of \"income\", with no vagueries, then whether or not a lawsuit winnings constituted \"income\" would not need \"interpretation\".\nMeaningless? How ironic because you pretty much state that when a law is written the words have no meaning. If you have a law that states \"you may levy an income tax\" then does income not have a meaning? Did the writers really have no idea what they were writing? Now if a court has to decide are you really saying that they are the ones who get to determine (temporally) what the meaning of \"income\" is? They get to make this decision? I reject this because it assumes it had no meaning before the court said so and goes against the purpose of congress or and legislative body. This is exactly why they are said to interpret. They figure out meaning by searching in past documents for what Congress meant by income. If they are unable to come up with any original meaning then they have no power to make up one or \"decide\" one.\n \n \nIn your real, \"apply it to specific scenarios\" would just mean the courts go \"Oh. Well let's look at the definition of \"income\". It (does / does not) include court winnings, therefore the ruling is this...\"\nyes, exactly. Of course the use the definition or meaning at the time of adoption as this is what congress or a legislative body adopted. They obviously had a meaning in mind for the term \"income\".\n \n \nThis arbitrary claim of yours is made even more banal when one realizes that such a world WOULD NOT REQUIRE A HIERARCHY of courts.\n Why \"appeal\" the decision when the court case obviously includes a clear-cut explanation with no \"decision\" by the courts???\nmeaning is not always easy to determine. This hardly equates to getting to decide meaning though. In a perfect world or theoretical world you would never need a judge but that is not the case.\n \n I stated this awhile ago in our discussion and it is a good time to repeat it: Now if by \"decide meaning\" you mean look back in history for a meaning you are unsure of and figure it from that past data (such as the federalist papers for some provisions) then I'd be happy to admit I'm wrong.\n \n \n1) What's funny is that you DO NOT EVEN REFUTE my analysis of your stance.\n You do NOT DENY that you are advocating: \"SCOTUS would get up in the morning, tell the court listeners what they already knew, and that's it.\"\nI'm sure in many cases they do already know. Just because meaning is available doesn't mean everyone knows it. This is why we have judges. \n \n \n2) The \"listeners\" can have an idea what the law says.\n They can READ the law, which would lead them to a prefunctory understanding that the 14th amendment was not in the \"original interpretation of the constitution\".\n They can GO TO SCHOOL and STUDY law.\n It's like you're insisting to have as much knowledge as a doctor without even bothering to crack open a book!\nBut see the point is the average person can understand most of the law just like the average person can determine many sicknesses or injuries without a doctor. The purpose of the judge is to explain meaning as it applies to the facts of a case. They specialize in knowing the meaning. \n \n \nand pretend you know better than people who have gone to law school and served decades on the bench.\nI don't even need to do this. Many of the bench agree with me.\n \n \nSo again, if I were to say \"original interpretation of the constitution\", what date would that be?\nIt would be many dates depending on the ratified date.\n \n \nCan't seem to admit how completely meaningless your claim is, can you...\nSo what clause incorporated the 1st amendment to the states again? Ohh, that's right...you were merely just giving me the beginning of the sentence that contained the right clause. Can't me that you just have no idea what you are talking about even when the privileges and immunities clause was the only thing quoted and is the most common mistake when talking about incorporation.

Change is always easier for people if done in little steps. Religion can be used as a weapon against change. However the most anti gay people are some of the most religious. Example Pat Robertson, James Dobson, Mike Huckabe, Rick Santorum, Ralph Reed, Gary Bauer, and Fred Phelps. Another problem is that religion does not change. The bible tells the story of people 2000 to 3000 years ago and is hardly relevent to todays everyday life esp. in the west. Nothing new has been added to the bible since it was codified. Who lives in a tent, herds sheep on foot, women are not property, people don't walk, and we don't have slavery. The day to day life of a person 2500 years ago is not comparable to a persons life today. The concept of two men living and loving together didn't exist then.",

   "So you believe that what rights your god has bestowed, a majority can vote out of existence.\n Under our form of government they can be voted out of acceptance...not out of existence. That is a down side to such a type of government. The alternative is much worse though.\n \n \nI mean, you can scarcely argue that if we have a dispute about a right, we can \"decide\" whether it is \"real\" by voting, if that right has been established or not by your god! Suppose the vote goes against your god???\nGoing against what I believe is a real possibility. I don't argue you shouldn't try to enact what you think is a right, I only argue that the only way for us to have rights in government is to vote on what rights we think exist.\n \n \nThat hardly improves your position, which remains one of populist tyranny.\nYou can call it populist tyranny but I'd find that better than minority tyranny which would be the stance you take (using the extreme use of terms you have used).\n \n \nIf you insist on the right of a populist tyranny to trample the rights of a minority, then that minority has the right to rebel and overthrow the tyranny by any means at its disposal. The only majorities that have the moral authority to govern are those that reasonably address the just concerns of minorities. Votes do not settle core issues; but they can set them on fire when minority rights are ignored.\nFirst off, I don't like the term \"minority rights\". This assumes that only those folks have those rights. Rights are across the board in my opinion. My point is this, seeing that rights have to be a government issue the only way to decide what rights exists, since we all seem to disagree on them, is to vote on which ones we think exist. Is this a perfect system? No. But the alternative is to have either a system where one or a few people make the decision on what rights exist or we have anarchy. I'd prefer the risks of a democracy over those two.\n \n \nThe laws against sodomy, for example, were morally wrong and unjustifiable. They were routinely broken by many, including myself, which engenders disrespect for the validity of law.\n \n If you want to be seen to be governing legitimately, even if you are a majority, then you have to govern with forbearance and not force your morality on those who will not have it at any price. Otherwise, you have no legitimacy as a government, and such an unjust government is fair game for insurrection and subversion.\nWhether you like it or not most laws force a morality on people. Someone will have to loss and that is the way it will be. When you say sodomy laws were wrong then convince the people they are wrong and vote it out. Obviously if most agree with you then it would taken away. If the majority of citizens felt it was wrong and should be outlawed then why would you feel your view is above theirs? Finally, a law being broken often doesn't make it a law not worth having. Speeding laws are always broken for example. \n \n \nNo, because I prefer this distinction to be clearly understood. The constitutional limits to democracy are very important, but you claim there shouldn't be any.\nThe distinction is one we all know. I'm not going to discuss this further and will continue to use democracy. If you prefer to continue with pointless semantics then I'll just ignore that part of the post. Now if you prefer to argue on what limits actually exist then I'd be happy to engage in that. Our constitution doesn't remove anything from process.\n \n \nIt's the agreement of the people that establishes legitimacy. An unjust government forgoes that legitimacy. And yes, the Constitution does place limits on government authority and power. So does the common law development of the Supreme Court.\nCommon law is developed by any court and is irrelevant to the talk of statutory law which the constitution is. Contracts, for example, are common law. \n \n As for legitimacy, the constitution sets up legitimacy in that it allows certain processes for certain issues. For example some powers are only for the federal government while others are to the states. Other times it requires a larger majority to pass a law. It certainly isn't a crazy notion to think the constitution doesn't say you can't have moral laws. We had moral laws back when it was created and to think this was because they didn't understand the constitution they wrote (I realize you didn't say this) would be insane. \n \n The constitution doesn't say \"live and let live\" as you seem to suggest.\n \n \nDoesn't really matter. The authority of Congress is not absolute, and its powers are limited. And rightly so, because pure democracies cannot be trusted.\nThey are limited in what they can enact but this doesn't mean the state also has this same restriction. This was a major point in the constitution. Prior to the expansion of the commerce clause, things like roads and education were solely up to the states. Anything regarding moral laws such as animal cruelty were also up to the states...gambling also comes to mind. So a limit on congress doesn't mean a limit on all government but rather a protection of federalism. There is not one idea that is outside the realm of debate. The constitution has some ideas that require more votes to either pass or get rid of but these are few. Congress limiting speech is a good example of this. \n \n I disagree with the thought that the US constitution removes ideas from the democratic process.",

   "Under our form of government they can be voted out of acceptance...not out of existence. That is a down side to such a type of government. The alternative is much worse though.\n\n That's an opinion based on whether a person prizes protection of equal rights more over a majority's will to ignore equal rights.\n Obviously, our founding fathers felt that protection of equal rights were more important.\n \n \n \nGoing against what I believe is a real possibility. I don't argue you shouldn't try to enact what you think is a right, I only argue that the only way for us to have rights in government is to vote on what rights we think exist.\n\n Thoroughly nonsensical.\n Steeeeve? Do we CURRENTLY \"have rights in government\"?\n Yes. (I'll answer for him cause he won't answer simple questions that prove him wrong...)\n \n Are we currently able to \"vote on what rights we think exist\"?\n No. Not the way you intend.\n \n Ergo, your claim is proven obviously false by a simple reflection on reality.\n \n \n \nYou can call it populist tyranny but I'd find that better than minority tyranny which would be the stance you take (using the extreme use of terms you have used).\n\n AGAIN with this mundane insistence that it is \"tyranny\" for equal rights to be protected when the majority wishes to ignore equal rights.\n \"Equal rights\" is evidently a burden to some people that equates to \"tyranny\".\n \n \n \nFirst off, I don't like the term \"minority rights\". This assumes that only those folks have those rights.\n\n I am positively astounded at the thorough lack of logic employed.\n This is like saying \"If you say *red car*, that assumes that there are only *red cars*.\"\n No. The phrase \"minority rights\" does NOT \"assume\" that only minorities have rights.\n \n \n \nRights are across the board in my opinion.\n\n In everybody's opinion.\n But of course, you love strawman, so misrepresenting other people's statements to imply they said that only the minorities have rights is the best you can do...\n \n \n \nMy point is this, seeing that rights have to be a government issue the only way to decide what rights exists, since we all seem to disagree on them, is to vote on which ones we think exist.\n\n Again, this is obviously false.\n It is not the \"only way to decide what rights exist\", as evidenced by the fact our government works under a slightly different system.\n \n \n \nIs this a perfect system? No. But the alternative is to have either a system where one or a few people make the decision on what rights exist or we have anarchy. I'd prefer the risks of a democracy over those two.\n\n I would love for you to say that while you reside in a Muslim theocracy country.\n You're white, male, and Christian. A trifecta for complaining about violated rights, often when no real violation took place.\n You want the POWER to make decisions which effect whether other people you are prejudiced against have certain rights protected.\n You not having that power is not \"force\" against you.\n \n \n \nWhether you like it or not most laws force a morality on people. Someone will have to loss and that is the way it will be.\n\n Whenever you talk about \"laws\" and \"morality\", can you do us all a favor and just remember the phrase \"compelling state interest\"?\n Cause it addresses a LOT of your strawman arguments.\n \n \n \nWhen you say sodomy laws were wrong then convince the people they are wrong and vote it out.\n\n 1) A majority clearly thought that sodomy laws were wrong, as evidenced by repeated polls.\n 2) Sorry, but no.\n We'll work with the system that we have, which protects rights via existing constitutional amendments / provisions.\n Your response is like telling us that we should use the I-430 to get to work instead of I-760. \n Why? Because you want us to...\n \n \n \nObviously if most agree with you then it would taken away.\n\n Another false statement.\n ALL the polls on the issue of sodomy showed a clear opposition to the laws.\n The power of the conservative Christian religious right is not representative of their numbers.\n \n \n \nThe distinction is one we all know. I'm not going to discuss this further and will continue to use democracy.\n\n This claim (\"one we all know\") is obviously false, as evidenced by Steeeeve's numerous obviously false statements given above...\n And Steeeeve, you'll continue to use the system we got. Not the system you think we should have...",

   "1) So to put the cards on the table, what things do you object to?\n allowing marriage between people of the same sex and probably things concerning adoption although this would depend on several things such as funding of adoption homes etc.\n \n \n2) Whether you like it or not, how \"sodomy laws\" were removed from the books is a function of how our government does business.\n Has done business, with the methodology having constitutional mandate and legal precedent that stretches back for decades / centuries.\nlegal precedent was certainly not a virtue in this case. It pretty much overturned a case decided a little over a decade earlier.\n \n In any event, it was illegitimate in my opinion and that was the only point I wanted to make.\n \n \nMoreover, the \"voting\" method has ridiculous (and unnecessary) pitfalls.\n Like I pointed out, the Christian religious right has power disproportionate to their actual voting numbers.\n If you want to talk about \"voting\", a vast majority approve of having hate crime legislation, protection against sexual orientation discrimination, and a variety of other issues.\n And while I don't exhaustively read your posts, the ones I see make NO NOTE of the majority not getting their way on these issues.\n Somehow, the will of the majority being reflected in legislation appears only a concern of yours when you WANT the legislation.\nThe system is set up for people to vote and if they don't do so then you can run the risk of a seeming majority not getting their way. The vast majority of people are against abortion after the first trimester (if I recall correctly) but then again we don't have a law that way.\n \n I do think voter apathy is a problem.\n \n \nYet I'm sure you and Jyoshu will talk about it ad nausieum, in all its non-topical glory...\nI can't speak for Jyoshu. My point was that you can post whatever you want. I may respond that I don't like your debate tactics from time to time but you are welcome to do this.\n \n \nIn the debates I have been used to, terms are not defined before the debate.\n Their definitions are fair game.\nThen you just get down to semantics in the debate making it worthless.\n \n \nHowever, my key focus would be on \"disallowed\", cause I see no tangible mechanism which \"disallows\" you from voting.\n Some issues may require you to make a constitutional amendment, but there is still nothing to prevent you from doing so.\n Conceivably, we could \"vote\" tomorrow to return blacks to slave status. While I find that morally repugnant, there is nothing \"disallowing\" that from happening.\nThen we don't really disagree.\n \n \nThat's a bit like saying \"I am going to be absolute dictator of anybody who signs a contract acknowledging me as such. It is \"fair\" because anybody is allowed to sign the document.\"\nThat actually would be fair. There was consideration from both parties and a contract was signed. What is unfair about that? If you find a contract to be unfair, naturally, you wouldn't sign it. It is fair between the parties involved who agree on it. That is all I am saying.\n \n Now is it fair that I want to develop my own contract for you to agree with without any input from you? Well that depends on what you find fair but it is irrelevant in that my offer stands as is. You can either agree to look at it or if you feel there is no way you'd agree to our contract then I won't bother writing it. I'm done discussing the issue, either you want the contract or don't...if not then I'll stop talking about it.",

   "No, one that either assumes everything is a liberty or decides for the people is worse. That is the alternative.\n\n \n Nope. You are setting up a false dichotomy between anything goes, and nothing goes unless approved of by the majority. No-one is obliged to accept either of your alternatives, as there are other options, one of which is to recognise the right to freedom to make moral, personal decisions that do not injure anyone. No other society would be worth living in, for men who would call themselves free.\n \n \nOnce again this already sets up a standard by which government can enact or restrict rights.\n\n \n The government can do anything the people allow it to get away with. The Constitution is only worth the willingness of the people to see that it is enforced, and that its promise of equal rights is upheld. \n \n \nYou get back to where we started of why should we go with your view of \"not voting on rights unless the violate another's claimed rights\" instead of another? Furthermore, you are going to have to come up with criteria for this since every right could easily be claimed to restrict another.\n\n \n You want the notion of equal rights to be overturned by the whim of the majority. That is just populist tyranny. \n \n \nWhat if you thought killing a dog was immoral? Why can't I do that in the privacy of my own home?\n\n \n I am not going to invade your home to stop you killing your pets.\n \n \nIn short, all your standard does is really take away the ability to restrict rights you don't want restricted while at the same time allowing the rights you want restricted to be restricted. It is \"against American tradition\", according to your logic as I follow it, that any drug law, prostitution law, bigamy law, animal cruelty law, pollution law, etc etc exist. There is not one of those where I couldn't say \"I have a right to ____\" and you would have to either deny that right and thus nullify your entire point or accept that to be true and we end up with anarchy.\n\n \n I claim a basic right to do anything I damn well please, so long as it doesn't injure another individual or society in general. You would deprive me of that right, by using the government to sanction my moral choice, and compelling me to abide by your religious beliefs, however obnoxious I find them. And trust me, I do find them obnoxious, but I have no intention of forcing you to accept mine instead. As far as I'm concerned, you have every right to live in the moral straitjacket of your own choosing. \n \n So no dice. You are the one advocating tyranny, Steve. You just refuse to admit it.",

   "It is \"against American tradition\", according to your logic as I follow it, that any drug law, prostitution law, bigamy law, animal cruelty law, pollution law, etc etc exist.\n\n \n Steve, you have never yet managed to follow logic, so let's not pretend you do now.\n \n Well, some of those laws would be against American tradition. Anti-drug and prostitution laws are, in my view, problematic, as are anti-bigamy laws (though breach of marital contract would not be). They are all invasions of privacy and individual liberty. As long as bad behaviour is kept off the streets where it affects third parties, who cares what people do to themselves and consenting, adult partners in the privacy of their homes? Anti-pollution laws are permissible because pollution injures other individuals without their consent, and I would allow anti-animal cruelty laws, because cruelty causes needless pain to sentient animals. (BTW, killing your pet isn't necessarily cruelty to animals. If you were taking them off the street and torturing them, however, you're toast so far as I'm concerned. Not at all comparable to gay marriage.)\n \n I have a rational reason for all my opinions. You are welcome to try and persuade me otherwise, but the reasons had better be good.\n \n I've yet to see your rational reason for anti-gay laws, steve, and I suspect i will be a long time waiting.",

   "No, one that either assumes everything is a liberty or decides for the people is worse. That is the alternative.\n\n 1) Nobody is assuming \"everything\" is a liberty. Quit with the strawman arguments already.\n 2) It amazes me how you presume to talk about the \"original interpretation\" and \"founding fathers\", but then you talk in a way so alien and contrary to what they had to say...\n \n From the Declaration of Independence:\n \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. - That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men,...\"\n But in Steeeeve's seeming opinion, the purpose of instituting governments is NOT to \"secure these rights\" which are \"unalienable\" and \"endowed\" by our \"creator\", but rather to help allow the majority to legislate against the minority at the whim of the majority.\n \n And what I really funny to me about this whole situation is that I have argued with a variety of people who quote the above as \"proof\" that this country is \"founded\" on Christianity.\n Part of the irony being that it is painfully obvious that the above is NOT a \"Christian\" ideal because quite frankly, there are WAYYYY too many Christians who believe the anti-thesis of the above...\n \n \n \nI'm in minority on plenty of issues.\n\n Forest for the trees.\n I would love to see your stance if your were A minority.\n Not \"on plenty of issues\", but a minority whose minority status actually put you at risk of losing rights because the majority wanted to discriminate against you.\n \n I'm betting your tune would change REALLY quick.\n \n \n \nOnce again this already sets up a standard by which government can enact or restrict rights. You get back to where we started of why should we go with your view of \"not voting on rights unless the violate another's claimed rights\" instead of another?\n\n The whole \"14th amendment\" thing comes to mind, with \"compelling state interest\"...\n Our founding fathers' philosophy, as evidenced both in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.\n \n \n \nFurthermore, you are going to have to come up with criteria for this since every right could easily be claimed to restrict another. \n\n What a load of junk.\n No. \"every right\" cannot be easily claimed to restrict another. At least not in an rational or intelligent way.\n I have no doubt you would make that claim, but in the real world your claims ring false and uncredible.\n \n Moreover, the \"criteria\" has been repeatedly explained to you.\n \"Legitimate State Interest\". 14th amendment.\n \n \n \nWell it doesn't say that anywhere and for good reason.\n\n \"Legitimate State Interest\". 14th amendment.\n Concepts you repeatedly avoid acknowledging or discussing...\n \n \n \nIn short, all your standard does is really take away the ability to restrict rights you don't want restricted while at the same time allowing the rights you want restricted to be restricted.\n\n More strawman arguments.\n No wonder you refused allowing that contract to restrict other forms logical fallacies.\n No wonder both you and Jyoshu didn't want to take me up on the \"moderated debate\" offer.\n You two are too fond of your own logical fallacies. Calling night as day. Black as white.\n And other people's arguments as something that they are clearly not.\n \n This is about acknowledging the existence of fundamental rights. For everybody.\n I find the actions of some anti-gay Christians as incredibly antagonistic and derisive. But these actions are still covered as rights. And they should not be restricted.\n \n Once again, you are in a position where you are trying to claim that somebody else is doing something analagous to your approach, and it's thoroughly false.\n You could be asked WHAT RIGHT does Lesz want to restrict (as your statement claims), but we both know you couldn't list any cause you're just making up junk at this point.\n \n \n \nIt is \"against American tradition\", according to your logic as I follow it, that any drug law, prostitution law, bigamy law, animal cruelty law, pollution law, etc etc exist.\n\n 1) You shouldn't utter any phrase on \"American tradition\" until you can justify it.\n As I point out above, it is a FOUNDING FATHER IDEAL to protect rights that you insist on the capability to ignore.\n 2) You should make a little sign that says \"compelling state interest\" and attach it to your monitor.\n It addresses so much #### that you say, and then people wouldn't have to keep saying it back to you...\n \n \n \nThere is not one of those where I couldn't say \"I have a right to ____\" and you would have to either deny that right and thus nullify your entire point or accept that to be true and we end up with anarchy.\n\n Again, COMPELLING STATE INTEREST.\n You keep acting like our existing system has no limits to what can be claimed as a right, or what can be protected as a right.\n That's not only a strawman argument when you try to apply that to others, but a gross hyperbole.",
