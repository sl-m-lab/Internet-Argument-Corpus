I've seen a two headed goat, a six legged calf and a six legged bullfrog (deemed illegal in frog jumping contests).\n\n \n Not really my area of expertise, so this is just a guess.\n \n When you first develop, you're a mass of undifferentiated cells. As the cells accumulate, chemical cues start to organize the cells. Up and down, left and right, front and back get assigned. Then other cues start telling cells to become certain things. Organs, limbs, etc. Some region gets told, \"you're going to be the head\", and a head starts growing there, which is to say the cells there, instead of being undifferentiated, start turning into the cells you would expect in a head.\n \n All that I'm sure of, now here comes the guess. If, early in the \"you're going to become a head\" process a cell splits when it wasn't supposed to, then both new cells could get the \"you, you become the head\" cue. And so they both try to become the head. Now, four arms and four legs is probably the result of something a bit more complicated than a simple case of an unexpected cell division, but probably not hugely more. Some cue got doubled up some how and so two sets of limbs grew.",
