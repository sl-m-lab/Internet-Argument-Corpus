   "Outlaw Wanted posters from the US have been updated:\n \n http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-02-02-wanted-posters_x.htm\n \n Original wanted posters, nailed on town walls, telegraph poles, and other places people would see them, are now worth a tidy sum as memorabilia. And they worked as intended.\n \n IMO this is a progressive step for contemporary LE. While some US Post Offices still display the FBI's 10 most wanted criminals, that's not what I'd consider an acceptable wast of paper in a country with a population of 294-million. \n \n If today's media experts who control TV are smart enough to climb on that band wagon with say one 10-second spot during all news reports featuring the current local bad guy/woman, with a substantial reward, which is what made the original concept successful.\n \n My only concern with this revived method of LE is current US federal administration seeing an opportunity to use my money to put mere suspects in those ads through legislation of FTC regulated networks. I don't need or want any more propaganda.",
