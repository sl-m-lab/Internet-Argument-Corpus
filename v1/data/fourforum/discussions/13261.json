   "1. The Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home.Pp. 2-53.\n (a) The Amendment's prefatory clause announces a purpose, but does not limit or expand the scope of the second part, the operative clause. The operative clause's text and history demonstrate that it connotes an individual right to keep and bear arms. Pp. 2-22.\n (b) The prefatory clause comports with the Court's interpretation physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. The Antifederalists\n feared that the Federal Government would disarm the people in order to disable this citizens' militia, enabling a politicized standing army or a select militia to rule. The response was to deny Congress power to abridge the ancient right of individuals to keep and bear arms, so that the ideal of a citizens' militia would be preserved. Pp. 22-28.\n (c)\n The Court's interpretation is confirmed by analogous arms-bearing rights in state constitutions that preceded and immediatelyfollowed the Second Amendment. Pp. 28-30.\n (d)\n The Second Amendment's drafting history, while of dubious interpretive worth, reveals three state Second Amendment proposals that unequivocally referred to an individual right to bear arms. Pp. 30-32.\n (e)\n Interpretation of the Second Amendment by scholars, courts and legislators, from immediately after its ratification through the late 19th century also supports the Court's conclusion. Pp. 32-47.\n (f)\n None of the Court's precedents forecloses the Court's interpretation.\n Neither United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542, 553, nor Presser v. Illinois, 116 U. S. 252, 264-265, refutes the individual-rights interpretation. United States v. Miller, 307 U. S. 174, does not limit the right to keep and bear arms to militia purposes, but rather limits the type of weapon to which the right applies to those used by the militia, i.e., those in common use for lawful purposes. Pp. 47-54.\n 2.\n Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose: For example, concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendment or state analogues. The Court's opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. Miller's holding that the sorts of weapons protected are those \"in common use at the time\" finds support in the historical traditionof prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons. Pp. 54-56.\n 3.\n The handgun ban and the trigger-lock requirement (as applied to self-defense) violate the Second Amendment. The District's total ban on handgun possession in the home amounts to a prohibition on an entire class of \"arms\" that Americans overwhelmingly choose for the lawful purpose of self-defense. Under any of the standards of scrutiny the Court has applied to enumerated constitutional rights, this prohibition-in the place where the importance of the lawful defense of self, family, and property is most acute-would fail constitutional muster. Similarly, the requirement that any lawful firearm in the home be disassembled or bound by a trigger lock makes it impossiblefor citizens to use arms for the core lawful purpose of self-defense and is hence unconstitutional. Because Heller conceded at oral argument that the D. C. licensing law is permissible if it is not enforced arbitrarily\n and capriciously, the Court assumes that a license will satisfy his prayer for relief and does not address the licensing requirement. Assuming he is not disqualified from exercising Second Amendment rights, the District must permit Heller to register his handgun and must issue him a license to carry it in the home. Pp. 56-64.\n \n The question is what is the difference between a trigger lock and a locked container in hindering the use of a firearm for self defense?",

Pp. 56-64.\n \n The question is what is the difference between a trigger lock and a locked container in hindering the use of a firearm for self defense?\n\n \n None really, their both the same far as I'm concerned.\n \n \n \n 10/18/00 3:10 p.m.\n Not-so Safe-Storage Laws\n The only ones \"safe\" are the intruders.\n \n By Dave Kopel, Dr. Paul Gallant & Dr. Joanne Eisen\n of the Independence Institute\n \n \n e're told that \"safe-storage\" laws for guns are all about saving the lives of our children. In fact, these laws lead directly to the deaths of both children and adults. The only people to end up safer are violent home intruders.\n \n In a chapter in a book published last month, The Crime Drop in America (Cambridge Univ. Press), Dr. Garen Wintemute - one of the intellectual stars of the anti-gun movement - commented on \"access to firearms\" in America.\n \n According to a 1996 Department of Justice survey, 35 to 40 percent of American households have firearms in them. (The true figure may be closer to 1 out of 2 households, since some gun owners may be reluctant to disclose private information to pollsters.).... remarkably, one-third of handguns in the United States - perhaps 20 million guns - were stored loaded and not locked away.\" \n \n Loaded guns just lying around the homes of Americans, ready for action. A clear and present danger to the families in those households? Not according to current safety figures.\n \n In 1994, fatal gun accidents reached the lowest annual level since record-keeping began in 1903. They've dropped even lower each year since.\n \n What should have been \"remarkable\" to Wintemute is that there were just 20 fatal gun accidents among children under the age of 5 in 1998. Contrast this with phony claims you hear about \"10 children a day killed by guns.\" The greatest part of that factoid comes from gang-related homicides perpetrated by inner-city, 17-to-19-year-old male criminals.\n \n Also contrast the 20 fatal gun accidents for children 0-to-4 with the near 600 children in that same age group who drowned. In fact, more children under the age of 5 drown in 5-gallon buckets of water than are harmed in a firearm accident.\n \n You'd never know this by reading the current fundraising letter from Handgun Control, Inc. (HCI), which shrieks about parents leaving loaded guns on the dining room table within reach of small children. The letter doesn't point to any actual instances of such dining-room tragedy. Rather it complains that most states don't have a law specifically forbidding it.\n \n In truth, all states have reckless endangerment and negligence laws which apply to guns, drain cleaner, knives, vodka, or anything else that might cause injury in the hands of a small child. Even without an HCI-mandated gun-lock law, parents know plenty of ways to keep items away from children without using mechanical locks.\n \n We are told that \"reasonable\" trigger-lock laws are the cure for firearm accidents and gun thefts. What we are not told is that trigger-locks won't stop 10-year-olds, who can pop them off with screwdrivers, or break them with hammers. Such locks certainly won't stop determined criminals. So just who is the target of these \"reasonable\" gun laws, and what's their real purpose?\n \n Rather than saving lives, could it be that trigger-lock laws are intended to condition Americans into believing that firearms aren't acceptable for self-defense, or worth the bother?\n \n Safe and Sorry\n The most up-to-date research on the effect of gun-storage laws comes from Dr. John Lott and Dr. John Whitley in a study scheduled for publication in the April 2001 issue of the Journal of Law and Economics. In \"Safe Storage Gun Laws: Accidental Deaths, Suicides, and Crime\", Lott and Whitley analyzed the effects of safe storage laws from data spanning nearly 20 years. Their preliminary findings were released on March 29, 2000.\n \n Lott and Whitley found that not only did such laws not save lives, they cost lives by making it more difficult to have a firearm ready for a sudden emergency. During the first 5 years after the passage of \"safe-storage\" laws, the group of 15 states that adopted them saw average annual increases of murders (over 300), rapes (3,860), robberies (24,650), and aggravated assaults (over 25,000).\n \n The significant danger of gun-storage laws was brought home in an August incident in Merced, California, where a pitchfork-wielding man attacked Jessica Carpenter's 7-year-old brother and 9-year-old sister. It's neither a surprise nor a coincidence that the cause of this tragedy went unreported by the national press.\n \n Jessica's father had kept a gun in the home, and his children had learned how to fire it. Jessica, age 14, is a very good shot. But by California law, the gun had to be locked up when the parents weren't home. So, when the murderer attacked, Jessica wasn't able to retrieve the gun to save her siblings. She ran to a neighbor, and begged for help. By the time the police showed up, the 7-year-old boy and the 9-year-old girl had been stabbed to death with the pitchfork.\n \n In the aftermath, the children's great-uncle, Rev. John Hilton, declared that their father was \"more afraid of the law than of somebody coming in for his family. He's scared to death of leaving the gun where kids could get it because he's afraid of the law. He's scared to teach his children to defend themselves.\"\n \n According to Section 12035 of California's Dangerous Weapons Control Law, \"criminal storage of a firearm in the first degree\" is punishable by confinement to state prison for a maximum of 3 years, and/or a fine of up to $10,000.\n \n But it was compliance with California's \"safe-storage\" laws - and the fear of being prosecuted for their violation - that cost the Carpenter family two of their children.\n \n Lobbying with Lives\n When it comes to \"safe-storage,\" the real tragedy is that, despite all the professed concerns about \"the children,\" the anti-self-defense lobby has no qualms in playing politics with the lives of children. Wintemute, who has a much stronger record for intellectual honesty than many other researchers on his side of the gun issue, admits that for \"child-access prevention laws...at this time there is no good evidence that the laws are effective.\"\n \n Indeed, there is direct evidence that these are lethal laws. The tragedy in Merced is just one graphic instance of the thousands of additional murders and violent crimes that have resulted from criminals being emboldened by gun-storage laws that turn a family's home into a safe zone for violent predators.\n \n The hidden agenda behind safe-storage laws has nothing to do with safety. First, the anti-gun lobby believes that armed self-defense, by people who are not government employees, is inherently immoral; so preventing families from protecting themselves is a step forward for civilization. The late David Clarke was the leading anti-gun advocate on the Washington, D.C. City Council. He claimed that his efforts to outlaw gun ownership for self-defense \"are designed to move this government toward civilization...I don't intend to run the government around the moment of survival.\"\n \n Mrs. Sarah Brady, Chair of Handgun Control, Inc., agrees: \"To me, the only reason for guns in civilian hands is for sporting purposes.\" As a direct result of her group's successful lobbying, the California government was emphatically not around at \"the moment of survival\" for the Carpenter children.\n \n In Canada, gun prohibitionists, such as then-Justice Minister Alan Rock, have used storage laws as a justification for imposing universal gun registration, since registration \"will create a sense of accountability on the part of the firearms owner to comply with some of the safe-storage laws that are in effect.\"\n \n As the next step, the anti-gun lobbies in Canada (who work closely with their American cousins) have begun pushing for \"community storage.\" Rather than keeping your guns in a safe in your home, you would have to keep your guns at a police station. When you wanted to use your gun for the day, you could check it out from the police station.\n \n This latest Canadian ploy isn't really new. Long ago, Sir Walter Raleigh wrote that the \"sophisticated and subtle tyrant\" will \"unarm his people, and store up their weapons, under pretence of keeping them safe.\"\n \n In the 1950s, one of the most popular sitcoms was Father Knows Best. Starring Robert Young as head of the Anderson family, it centered on family values and personal responsibility. The show was not entitled Government Knows Best. Half a century later, it's still true that parents, not legislators, know best how to keep their children safe.\n \n Because the vocabulary of the debate has a great influence on the debate's result, people who really care about family safety need to stop using the words \"safe storage\" when discussing lethal laws like government-storage mandates. These laws turn a family's home into a safe zone for criminals. \n \n emoticon_smile",
