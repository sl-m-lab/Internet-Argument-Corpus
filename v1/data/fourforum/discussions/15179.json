   "Brandon Davies BYU Controversy: Zero Tolerance, Zero Sense - TIME\n \n \n\n \n Two good kids. Two broken rules. Two parables of justice, except one offers a bracing lesson in honor and the other just leaves you heartsick at the latest evidence that zero tolerance often makes zero sense.\n \n One kid made headlines: Brandon Davies, star Brigham Young basketball player whose team was heading toward its first Final Four ever &#8212; until it emerged that he had violated the Mormon school's strict honor code, with its injunction to \"live a chaste and virtuous life.\" He had apparently slept with his girlfriend, an act that would barely register on most campuses, where athletes' failing grades, drunken sprees and loutish behavior are ignored as long as the players keep putting points on the board. BYU could have let Davies keep playing while the honor-code office \"investigated,\" but school officials were steadfast. Davies' teammates, whose hopes were also crushed, said they bore him no malice and considered him a brother. The crowd roared in ovation when he returned to the arena, in street clothes, to cheer on his team. \n (Is BYU's premarital-sex controversy good for college sports?)\n \n It would have been so easy to excuse him just this once &#8212; win a championship, reap the glory. But the players did the hard work that true forgiveness requires, offered it even as they lost their next game by 18 points, saw their championship hopes fade, knew potential recruits would surely pause. \"BYU knows all this stuff, and it suspended the kid anyway,\" noted Los Angeles Times sportswriter Bill Plaschke, \"and if you don't believe in its code, you have to love its honor.\"\n \n The other story offers nothing whatever to love, only to mourn. Nick Stuban was a 15-year-old boy scout in Fairfax County, Virginia, doing well, playing football, going to church. He was the only child of parents who had retired from the military. His mother suffered from Lou Gehrig's disease, as torturous an illness as you could ever watch consume someone you love. He helped take care of her, suctioning her tracheal tube in the middle of the night when the alarm went off. One day he bought a single capsule of a synthetic compound that acts like marijuana but is not illegal. Someone told school officials. Like Davies, he confessed, said it was a dumb thing to do. But in November, a school review board suspended him; he was separated from the friends who supported him, from the team, the Scouts, those in driver's ed. He pleaded in vain with officials to be allowed to return. And then, in January, he killed himself. \n (See pictures of extracurricular activities that keep kids' minds sharp.)\n \n Thus has Fairfax County become the latest to reconsider whether the edicts born of fear and Columbine actually make any sense or keep anyone safe. The original rules against drugs and knives soon swelled, with schools that once called parents now calling the police. Suddenly middle schoolers were being suspended for puddle stomping and Alka-Seltzer possession or referred to a drug-awareness program for accepting a breath mint. A 6-year-old in Delaware was suspended and threatened with reform school for taking to school a camping utensil that served as a fork, spoon and knife. A 9-year-old perp was questioned by police about a plan to launch a spitball with a rubber band; he had to undergo psychological counseling before he could go back to class. A 12-year-old New York City girl was led off in handcuffs for scribbling on her desk with an erasable marker. A high school sophomore was suspended for breaking the no-cell-phone rule when he took a call from his father ... who was serving in Iraq. A Florida honor student faced felony charges when a dinner knife &#8212; not a steak knife or a butcher knife &#8212; was found on the floor of her car, which she had parked at school. \"A weapon is a weapon is a weapon,\" the principal said.\n \n Except it's so obviously not. Sometimes a weapon is just a dinner knife. Making distinctions is part of learning. So is making mistakes. When authorities confuse intent and accident, when rules are seen as more sacred than sense, when a contrite first-time offender is treated no differently from a serial classroom menace, we teach children that authority is deaf and dumb, that there is no judgment in justice. It undermines respect for discipline at a stage when we want kids to internalize it.\n \n Which brings us back to Brandon Davies and why his punishment has been applauded rather than condemned. He chose the school, signed the honor code, knew what was expected &#8212; and confessed to falling short. We have watched this spring a pageant of celebrity entitlement: lawmakers who think the laws they make don't apply to them, actors who act as though standards are for suckers. Treating Davies as a man of honor, who accepts responsibility for his actions, protects him from the poison of privilege. No cutting corners, the school said. Your honor is worth more than our glory. Sometimes justice is at its most merciful when it's blind.\n \n \n \n Read more: Brandon Davies BYU Controversy: Zero Tolerance, Zero Sense - TIME\n\n \n I came across this article while reading the latest issue of Time Magazine and found it interesting enough to post on these forums for discussion. It seems that in this day and age, youth are being treated more like second class citizens. Whether they're being scapegoated for everything from bad driving and drug use to having the older generation economically screw them over (IE Bush era tax cuts coupled with wild spending), to full police interrogations for spitball wars or suspensions over receiving a call from family in Iraq, it seems easier and easier to get away with treating teenagers more like cattle and less like people.\n \n First I'll start with bad driving. Teenagers are held to much higher standards than everyone else. One minor screw up and our license is revoked. Yet the woman in the following video was let off for driving the wrong way DOWN A FREEWAY. Police Find Wrong-Way Freeway Driver&#8230;And She&#8217;s 84 | The Blaze\n \n She was simply \"interviewed at her home\". Had a teenager done the same thing, they most likely wouldn't not only had their license revoked, but suffered fines, jail time, and a nasty stain on their permanent record, simply because of their age. It is beyond my why this woman can get away with such a minor punishment while I, a licensed Pilot and an honor student, could be led away in cuffs for a BAC of 0.01 (virtually non impaired) simply because I'm 17.\n \n And then there's the gortesque abuse of the sex offender registry. A minor can become a registered sex offender for distributing lewd material... of themselves. It appears that you do not own your body, the government does. The sex offender registry was designed to protect children from dangerous sexual predators. Now it seems that teens have as much to fear from being swallowed whole by the registry for doing something adults do legally all the time as they do from the real sex offenders. And lets not forget the horrifying prospect of an 18 year old being charged with statutory rape for having sex with his 17 year old girlfriend. What baffles me is that the ones who continue to perpetuate these laws are the Conservative Republicans! The champions of \"small government\". A small government is not one which concerns itself with the actions of two consenting people.\n \n The abusive zero tolerance policies are mostly explained in the article. I challenge someone to provide me with a good reason why a kid should be expelled for \"fighting\" after being pummeled by a bully, or why a boy scout should be arrested for leaving a knife from an earlier camping trip in his backpack when he obviously had no intent to use it as a weapon. If California is so desperate to improve its education, maybe it should start preparing its students for college and not prison life.\n \n It seems that youth have more and more to fear from their government and their schools. With rampant zero intelligence policies to discriminatory driving laws, our society thinks it makes perfect sense for the punishment not to fit the crime, but only when it comes to those under 18. For everyone else (especially politicians and the higher ups, there is very little accountability. We fire the guards who abuse the prisoners and not the wardens who authorized it.) Apparently jail time and blemished records are excellent ways of protecting our youth. Nowhere in the constitution or the Bill of Rights does it say \"Must be 18 or older to apply\".",

Politicians need to do what they can to collect popular support, even if that means ensuring our future is bleak at best with out of control spending and tax cuts or with socially restrictive and borderline unconstitutional laws that look good on paper but are useless in reality.\n \n If every single young person would get out there and vote, most of our problems would be solved.",
