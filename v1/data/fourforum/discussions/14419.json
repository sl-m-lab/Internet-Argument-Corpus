   "The Conversation: High court tilts the scales in favor of guns - Sacramento Opinion - Sacramento Editorial | Sacramento Bee\n \n \nThe past 20 years have seen California's Legislature enact a wish list for gun control advocates, including \"banning\" so-called \"unsafe handguns,\" restricting handgun purchases to one per month and a number of expansions and clarifications of the original \"assault weapon\" legislation.\n \n All were touted as must-have tools for law enforcement's crime-fighting arsenal. Yet the result has been 20 years of unintended consequences, a steady erosion of the rights of gun owners, and no measurable enhancement of public safety.\n \n Initially, it was assumed that other states would follow California's lead and enact similar legislation &#8211; but that didn't happen. The rejection of California-style gun control by other states can be best understood by examining our process for issuing permits to carry concealed weapons.\n \n The key issue in the concealed weapon permit debate is trust. If government trusts you &#8211; you get a permit; if it doesn't, you don't. California gives sheriffs and police chiefs the authority to issue permits \"where good cause\" exists. What constitutes \"good cause\" is left to the subjective inclinations of the issuing authority.\n \n The most recent figures from the California Department of Justice show that, in 2007, San Francisco had six active CCW permits while Kern County had 4,118. As permits are good statewide, all the permitted folks from Kern County can &#8211; undoubtedly much to S.F.'s dismay &#8211; carry firearms for self-defense in San Francisco.\n \n California's newspapers have routinely highlighted questionable practices in issuing concealed weapons permits. Cronyism and hubris are corrosive to the moral authority of a police chief or sheriff and that is, in part, why 40 states (with more likely to follow) have eliminated \"good cause\" and similar vague requirements and instead issue permits to those who meet clear criteria.\n \n Legislation of all kinds is often crafted, not to enhance public policy but rather to influence elections. For years, gun control was a favorite with political consultants.\n \n The objective was to get their opponents' candidate to vote against \"reasonable gun control\" &#8211; such as \"handgun rationing,\" \"Goldilocks\" guns (too big or too small) or guns that could allegedly shoot down airplanes. The advocates would usually note that their efforts were \"for the children.\" The Legislature that brought you \"reasonable gun control\" is the same one that enjoys single-digit public approval, has dragged California to the edge of bankruptcy and diddles with such mindless matters as choosing a state rock and the relative safety of wooden baseball bats. Personal observation suggests that many of the legislators who supported the gun control agenda over the past two decades couldn't distinguish between a shotgun and a '36 Ford truck. Their legislative leadership told them how to vote &#8211; and they complied.\n \n The saga of \"assault weapon\" legislation also provides a sad but instructive window into gun control in the Golden State. Anti-gun groups falsely claim that the guns they call \"assault weapons\" have no sporting use, are designed for spray firing from the hip and are only suited for the military or police. So the Legislature decided to \"ban\" them. But in order to ban something one must first be able to define it. As the term \"assault weapon\" is one of political art &#8211; not mechanical function &#8211; the lawyers at the DOJ have been grappling with the definition for 20 years.\n \n It is also important to define what \"ban\" means in the context of California-style gun control. It doesn't mean \"no\" or \"absolutely prohibited\" &#8211; it means fees and draconian regulation. Thus, when the Roberti-Roos Assault Weapon Control Act became law in 1991, the crime was failure to register and pay a fee for a firearm you already owned. The AWCA authors explained that, with time and restrictions on new sales, attrition would eventually rid the state of such firearms.\n \n The initial wave produced 30,000-plus registrations. Fast-forward to 2006, and the number registered was approaching 170,000.\n \n The Colt AR-15 and the \"Made in China\" AK-47 can no longer be sold &#8211; but thanks to the evolving definition, if you'd like to buy the same rifles, albeit with different names and a DOJ-required part, they're readily available. It is a growing market that the California Legislature helped create.\n \n Sen. Dianne Feinstein's federal ban was even more vacuous (if that's possible) and sunsetted out of existence in 2004. In 2009, 65 Democratic members of the U.S. House of Representatives wrote to Attorney General Eric Holder to advise him that they wouldn't support a new assault weapon bill &#8211; a clear indication that the political winds had shifted.\n \n When the U.S Supreme Court issued its decision in McDonald v. City of Chicago last week &#8211; that the right to keep and bear arms is an individual right that applies to all states &#8211; my thoughts returned to my days at the Capitol. For most of the 1990s, I was the National Rifle Association's lobbyist in California. Before that I had been involved in the formulation of ACWA, as the loyal opposition, while a senior member of the law enforcement staff for former Attorney General John Van de Kamp.\n \n Specifically, while working as a lobbyist, I remember a discussion with a state senator who was both a gun control proponent and a constitutional law professor. He described to me why the Second Amendment was a \"collective\" and not an \"individual\" right. His conclusion was the rationale for compromising my freedoms. In my heart I knew he was wrong. Now the Supreme Court agrees.\n \n From my perspective, it's about freedom. As an honorably retired California cop, having a CCW permit is a retirement \"perk.\" It offends me mightily that my wife and children must ask, or depending on the county, beg, for the legal authority to provide for their own self-defense.\n \n It is also offensive that my \"nanny\" government can decide what handguns are safe enough for me to own and how many I can buy in a month. In a more rational environment, the results of two decades of gun control zealotry would be subjected to critical study and analysis. Given the manner in which California government functions, that is unlikely to happen.\n",

(a) As used in this chapter, the \"firing requirement \n for handguns\" means a test in which the manufacturer \n provides three handguns of the make and model for which \n certification is sought to an independent testing laboratory \n certified by the Attorney General pursuant to Section 12130. \n These handguns may not be refined or modified in any way \n from those that would be made available for retail sale if \n certification is granted. The magazines of a tested pistol \n shall be identical to those that would be provided with the \n pistol to a retail customer. The laboratory shall fire 600 \n rounds from each gun, stopping after each series of 50 \n rounds has been fired for 5 to 10 minutes to allow the \n weapon to cool, stopping after each series of 100 rounds has \n been fired to tighten any loose screws and clean the gun in \n accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, and \n stopping as needed to refill the empty magazine or cylinder \n to capacity before continuing.

A handgun shall pass this test if \n each of the three test guns meets both of the following:\n \n (1) Fires the first 20 rounds without a malfunction that is \n not due to ammunition that fails to detonate.\n \n (2) Fires the full 600 rounds with no more than six \n malfunctions that are not due to ammunition that fails to \n detonate and without any crack or breakage of an operating \n part of the handgun that increases the risk of injury to the \n user.\n \n (b) If a pistol or revolver fails the requirements of either \n paragraph (1) or (2) of subdivision (a) due to ammunition \n that fails to detonate, the pistol or revolver shall be \n retested from the beginning of the \"firing requirement for \n handguns\" test. A new model of the pistol or revolver that \n failed due to ammunition that fails to detonate may be \n submitted for the test to replace the pistol or revolver \n that failed.\n \n (c) As used in this section, \"malfunction\" means a failure \n to properly feed, fire, or eject a round, or failure of a \n pistol to accept or eject the magazine, or failure of a \n pistol's slide to remain open after the magazine has been \n expended.\n \n \n \n 12128. As used in this chapter, the \"drop safety \n requirement for handguns\" means that at the conclusion of \n the firing requirements for handguns described in Section \n 12127, the same certified independent testing laboratory \n shall subject the same three handguns of the make and model \n for which certification is sought, to the following test:\n \n A primed case (no powder or projectile) shall be inserted \n into the chamber. For pistols, the slide shall be released, \n allowing it to move forward under the impetus of the recoil \n spring, and an empty magazine shall be inserted. For both \n pistols and revolvers, the weapon shall be placed in a drop \n fixture capable of dropping the pistol from a drop height of \n 1m + 1cm (39.4 + 0.4 in.) onto the largest side of a slab of \n solid concrete having minimum dimensions of 7.5 X 15 X 15 cm \n (3 X 6 X 6 in.). The drop distance shall be measured from \n the lowermost portion of the weapon to the top surface of \n the slab. The weapon shall be dropped from a fixture and not \n from the hand. The weapon shall be dropped in the condition \n that it would be in if it were dropped from a hand (cocked \n with no manual safety applied). If the design of a pistol \n is such that upon leaving the hand a \"safety\" is \n automatically applied by the pistol, this feature shall not \n be defeated. An approved drop fixture is a short piece of \n string with the weapon attached at one end and the other end \n held in an air vise until the drop is initiated.\n \n The following six drops shall be performed:\n \n (a) Normal firing position with barrel horizontal.\n \n (b) Upside down with barrel horizontal.\n \n (c) On grip with barrel vertical.\n \n (d) On muzzle with barrel vertical.\n \n (e) On either side with barrel horizontal.\n \n (f) If there is an exposed hammer or striker, on the \n rearmost point of that device, otherwise on the rearmost \n point of the weapon.\n \n The primer shall be examined for indentations after each \n drop. If indentations are present, a fresh primed case \n shall be used for the next drop.\n \n The handgun shall pass this test if each of the three test \n guns does not fire the primer.",

   "How likely is that?

Ask around and anybody is bound to have a story about how a $10 magazine failed to feel, or failed to seat properly, or the feed lips were mangled, or came with extra metal burrs, or caused their weapon to jam. Hell some magazines won't even lock a slide back after the last round was fired. And if they can cause all of these errors in a well made pistol, it's not unreasonable to believe that they can fail to engage a magazine disconnect as well.\n \n \nUnless they accidentally shoot someone else.\n\n \n Well then that's a case for the courts. Nobody responsible would intentionally point a gun at somebody and pull the trigger after they just got done shooting it. You don't just assume a gun is empty, you guarantee that it's empty. And even when it is empty you still don't do a stupid thing like pointing it at somebody and pulling the trigger. If you have somebody that's that stupid then they deserve to go to prison on a murder charge.\n \n \nBut you're against those too.\n\n \n Absolutely. However California demanding a magazine disconnect could easily be viewed as an admittance of defeat and they're looking for substitutes to cover their ***es.",
