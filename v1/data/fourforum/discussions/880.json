   "I think both the Christian creationists and the scientists are both pretty convinced that they are correct and both sides believe the other is stubborn and wouldn't accept any view other than their own. So to determine to what extent this is true I as the question how much proof would it take to change your mind on God? If your a believer, would you change your mind on the existance of God if the Bible was proven to be written by a bunch of pranksters? How about if there were only a single proven flaw found in the Bible? What if time travel proved that Jesus was just a normal man? And if your a scientist, what if a cross appeared in the sky and the entire world was able to see it at the same time, would this change your mind on the existance of God? What if major Biblical prophecies such as the Rapture occurred? What if time travel showed that Jesus really was everything the Bible makes him out to be? At what point would either side be willing to scrap all of their current views and be willing to accept the other sides point of view as correct? Lets see how flexible each side really is.",

   "first i want to tell you where i stand with god. s/he's my buddy:)\n anyway, would there ever be proof enough to proove something so great? i dont believe in the bible so thats irrelevant. theres to much i dont agree with, it can be taken a lot of different ways. and it was written by a bunch of men, men make mistakes...\n why wouldn't jesus be normal, the whole virgin mary thing is XXXX, i think.\n the cross in the sky would be an awesome thing to see, but was it god? how would someone proove that? \"i saw god! there he was, woo!\"\n the rapture is a scary thought but i guess if im left behind all my friends will be here too, along with most of the planet, oh well.\n if jesus really is everything then i might have to chage my thought about him, but my thoughts on jesus and god are different.\n how do we know god isnt part of some alein race. maybe we all live in a jar on some kids shelf... we cant see the end of the universe so whos to say whats there. god in his frilly pink dress making tea, i hope he invites me over..(i watch too much sci fi)\n what about you?",

   "what worked for me was a logical deconstruction of the bible. the bible is the single and unquestioned authority for the christian God. it is the very foundation of God's definition, a supposed record of the exploits and interactions of God in times past\n \n the first logical problem is the lack of God's presence in the affairs of modern-day life. how could God part a sea back in the day and nothing even remotely close in our day? \n \n the second problem is the evidence that supports evolution. if evolution is true, it immediately renders genesis, and by extension the entire foundation of the bible and christianity, as false\n \n the third problem is the evidence surrounding the construction of the bible. almost everything in the old testament was necessarily overblown exagerration. the story of creation, cain and abel, the fall, the flood, the tower of babel, and of the other \"how it happened\" stories where all hebrew adaptations of stories that existed in other cultures before them. these events werent eye-witness accounts, but relayed tales with a hebrew flavor and introduced into the culture. today, we kept those tales, added them to our bible, and declare them God-truths, when they are obviously not\n \n the fourth problem is jesus himself. (whether jesus actually existed or is under debate. but thats not the problem.) did jesus know the truth that we know now? or was he also mislead by the borrowed stories in the very bible that made up his culture? the gospels suggest that jesus was a creationist and believed that there was a global flood. yet evidence suggests that these events never took place.\n \n most God-believing christians must necessarily avoid these problems, else they risk losing their religious status and the social position that they have built up. believe or not, many devout christians are hesitant or downright opposed sending their children to college, for fear that they learn \"too much\" and lose their religion\n \n however, if you honestly seek the truth, you will come face to face with these problems eventually",

   "Think a more interesting question would be 'if there was proof of god, would you worship him?' because, whilst with sufficient evidence, I will accept the existance of God, I would not worship and love him without some serious explainations first.\n No one is going to say they would stick to their beleifs regardless of proof, its going to make them look like an idiot.",
