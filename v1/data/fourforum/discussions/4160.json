   "The number 6 represents that which is not complete. This is especially true of the number 666. If \n 3 represents perfection, then the number 666 represents the perfect imperfection. What better\n number could there be to represent the Devil? The descendants of Cain are quoted only until the\n sixth generation. In Genesis 22 the words \"burnt offering\" are mentioning six times, the seventh\n being reserved for the Divinely perfect Substitute (v8). \n \n When the enraged Pharaoh pursued the Israelites, He did so with 600 chariots (Exodus 14:7).\n Three men stand out preeminently in the Scriptures as the enemy of God and his people and each\n of these is branded with the number 6. \"\"And there went out a champion out of the camp of the\n Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height [was] six cubits and a span. And [he had] an\n helmet of brass upon his head, and he [was] armed with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat\n [was] five thousand shekels of brass. And [he had] greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of\n brass between his shoulders. And the staff of his spear [was] like a weaver's beam; and his spear's\n head [weighed] six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield went before him\" (1 Samuel\n 17:4-7). \n \n Another is found in Daniel 3:1. \" NEBUCHADNEZZAR the king made an image of gold, whose\n height [was] threescore cubits, [and] the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of\n Dura, in the province of Babylon.\" And the other one is the antichrist as recorded in Revelation\n 13, which has the infamous number 666. \n \n The Number 7 represents completeness. In the Bible, when a cycle is finished or when something\n is complete, you will find the number 7. In Genesis 12:2-3 we have the blessing of Abraham\n with 7 promises \"And [1] I will make of thee a great nation, and [2] I will bless thee, and [3]\n make thy name great; and [4] thou shalt be a blessing: And [5] I will bless them that bless thee,\n and [6] curse him that curseth thee: and [7] in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.\"\n \n To the Israelite people God likewise gave them 7 promises. In Exodus 6:6-8 \"Wherefore say unto\n the children of Israel, I [am] the LORD, and [1] I will bring you out from under the burdens of\n the Egyptians, and [2] I will rid you out of their bondage, and [3] I will redeem you with a\n stretched out arm, and with great judgments: And [4] I will take you to me for a people, and [5] I\n will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I [am] the LORD your God, which bringeth you out\n from under the burdens of the Egyptians. And [6] I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the\n which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and [7] I will give it you for an\n heritage: I [am] the LORD.\"\n \n There were 7 feasts for Jehovah during 7 days. When Balak the Mohabite king tried to curse\n Israel, he made 7 altars and prepared 7 bullocks and 7 rams for the sacrifices. It was a complete\n and perfect heathen worship. When the people of God destroyed Jericho, 7 priests with 7\n trumpets went around the city 7 times, a complete and perfect victory of the faith. Christ\n explained the way to achieve complete forgiveness. \"Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee,\n Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven\" (Matthew 18:22). \n \n In the temple there were 7 candlesticks. There are 7 letters in the New Testament to 7 churches.\n In the book of Revelation we have 7 more letters to others 7 churches. Further in Revelation we\n read of 7 seals which seal a book closed, and there will be 7 plagues poured out upon the world.\n Jacob worked 2 times seven years to bring a complete testimony of his love for Rachel. During\n the days of Joseph, the Pharaoh had a dream in which he saw 7 fat cows and 7 skinny cows,\n which represented a complete period of famine. The total number of people who belonged to\n Jacob's family when they moved to Egypt was 70.\n \n the day of the sacking of\n Jerusalem by the Romans in 70CE\n \n http://www.bibleman.net/Keys_for_numbers.htm\n \n http://www.vic.australis.com.au/hazz/number006.html",

   "very comprehensive, joe. couldnt have done a better job :)\n \nAnd the other one is the antichrist as recorded in Revelation 13, which has the infamous number 666.\n\n Rvelation 13:\n 11 Then I saw another beast which rose out of the earth; it had two horns like a lamb and it spoke like a dragon. 12 It exercises all the authority of the first beast in its presence, and makes the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose mortal wound was healed. 13 It works great signs, even making fire come down from heaven to earth in the sight of men; 14 and by the signs which it is allowed to work in the presence of the beast, it deceives those who dwell on earth, bidding them make an image for the beast which was wounded by the sword and yet lived; 15 and it was allowed to give breath to the image of the beast so that the image of the beast should even speak, and to cause those who would not worship the image of the beast to be slain. 16 Also it causes all, both small and great, both rich and poor, both free and slave, to be marked on the right hand or the forehead, 17 so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark, that is, the name of the beast or the number of its name. 18 This calls for wisdom: let him who has understanding reckon the number of the beast, for it is a human number, its number is six hundred and sixty-six. \n \n sorry for the lengthy passage, but its just to bring the context of the number 666 with the rest of the passage. 666 is said to be the mark of the anti-christ, a \"beast\" that will rise up and control everyone's freedom and security. people speculate that it will probably be manifested in the \"smart chips\" that might be implanted in the hand and used for identification, credit, and even access to your house, job, car and even weapons. the concept is very ambitious, the technology already exists, and the idea of the convenience is being bought by the public even as we speak.\n \n i'm not sure how the number 666 will be implemented, if at all though...",

   "The number 6 represents that which is not complete. This is especially true of the number 666. If \n 3 represents perfection, then the number 666 represents the perfect imperfection. What better\n number could there be to represent the Devil? The descendants of Cain are quoted only until the\n sixth generation. In Genesis 22 the words \"burnt offering\" are mentioning six times, the seventh\n being reserved for the Divinely perfect Substitute (v8). \n \n When the enraged Pharaoh pursued the Israelites, He did so with 600 chariots (Exodus 14:7).\n Three men stand out preeminently in the Scriptures as the enemy of God and his people and each\n of these is branded with the number 6. \"\"And there went out a champion out of the camp of the\n Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height [was] six cubits and a span. And [he had] an\n helmet of brass upon his head, and he [was] armed with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat\n [was] five thousand shekels of brass. And [he had] greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of\n brass between his shoulders. And the staff of his spear [was] like a weaver's beam; and his spear's\n head [weighed] six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield went before him\" (1 Samuel\n 17:4-7). \n \n Another is found in Daniel 3:1. \" NEBUCHADNEZZAR the king made an image of gold, whose\n height [was] threescore cubits, [and] the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of\n Dura, in the province of Babylon.\" And the other one is the antichrist as recorded in Revelation\n 13, which has the infamous number 666. \n \n The Number 7 represents completeness. In the Bible, when a cycle is finished or when something\n is complete, you will find the number 7. In Genesis 12:2-3 we have the blessing of Abraham\n with 7 promises \"And [1] I will make of thee a great nation, and [2] I will bless thee, and [3]\n make thy name great; and [4] thou shalt be a blessing: And [5] I will bless them that bless thee,\n and [6] curse him that curseth thee: and [7] in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.\"\n \n To the Israelite people God likewise gave them 7 promises. In Exodus 6:6-8 \"Wherefore say unto\n the children of Israel, I [am] the LORD, and [1] I will bring you out from under the burdens of\n the Egyptians, and [2] I will rid you out of their bondage, and [3] I will redeem you with a\n stretched out arm, and with great judgments: And [4] I will take you to me for a people, and [5] I\n will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I [am] the LORD your God, which bringeth you out\n from under the burdens of the Egyptians. And [6] I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the\n which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and [7] I will give it you for an\n heritage: I [am] the LORD.\"\n \n There were 7 feasts for Jehovah during 7 days. When Balak the Mohabite king tried to curse\n Israel, he made 7 altars and prepared 7 bullocks and 7 rams for the sacrifices. It was a complete\n and perfect heathen worship. When the people of God destroyed Jericho, 7 priests with 7\n trumpets went around the city 7 times, a complete and perfect victory of the faith. Christ\n explained the way to achieve complete forgiveness. \"Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee,\n Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven\" (Matthew 18:22). \n \n In the temple there were 7 candlesticks. There are 7 letters in the New Testament to 7 churches.\n In the book of Revelation we have 7 more letters to others 7 churches. Further in Revelation we\n read of 7 seals which seal a book closed, and there will be 7 plagues poured out upon the world.\n Jacob worked 2 times seven years to bring a complete testimony of his love for Rachel. During\n the days of Joseph, the Pharaoh had a dream in which he saw 7 fat cows and 7 skinny cows,\n which represented a complete period of famine. The total number of people who belonged to\n Jacob's family when they moved to Egypt was 70.\n \n the day of the sacking of\n Jerusalem by the Romans in 70CE\n \n (bibleman.net/Keys_for_numbers.htm])\n \n (vic.australis.com.au/hazz/number006.html)\n\n \n I Always knew 7 was an important number but I DIDN'T know much about it. I knew 666 was the mark of the beast but I DIDN'T understand it. Now I got something to think about.\n \n You might want to post it on following website: \n \n (positivethoughts.com/forums/)\n \n Thanks,",
