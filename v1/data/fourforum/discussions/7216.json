   "Here is a scary one. \n \n \n \nDetroit Free Press\n \n Killer of 'devil' sentenced to 25-45 years\n Victim said he didn't believe in God, so his friend shot him\n \n December 29, 2005\n BY JOEL THURTELL\n FREE PRESS STAFF WRITER\n \n It was one of the five \"most heinous\" crimes Wayne County Circuit Judge Gregory Bill has ever seen.\n \n Wayne County Assistant Prosecutor Christina Guirguis called it the \"most gruesome\" crime she's ever prosecuted.\n \n On Dec. 20, Bill sentenced Arthur Eugene Shelton, 51, of Taylor to 25 to 45 years in prison for the Oct. 18, 2004, shotgun and revolver killing of Shelton's friend, Larry Hooper.\n \n \"He blew the guy's head off,\" said Shelton's attorney, Seymour Schwartz.\n \n Following a three-day bench trial, Bill found Shelton guilty Nov. 30 of second-degree murder for killing Hooper in the living room of his Taylor home, where Hooper was staying.\n \n At 12:44 p.m. that October day, Shelton called Taylor police and told a dispatcher that he'd just blasted a man with a revolver and a shotgun because the man said he didn't believe in God.\n \n The dead man was \"the devil himself,\" Shelton told the dispatcher.\n \n How many times did you shoot him? the dispatcher asked Shelton.\n \n \"Hopefully, enough,\" replied Shelton. \"I want to make sure he's gone.\"\n \n Shelton fired four or five revolver bullets and at least three shotgun blasts into 62-year-old Hooper's head, Guirguis said.\n \n \"This is a sort of victory,\" Schwartz said of the sentence. The judge could have sentenced Shelton to life in prison. At 51, Shelton will be 76 when he gets out of prison -- if he's released after 25 years. He could be held for the full 45 years, Schwartz said.\n \n In addition, Bill sentenced Shelton to two years in prison for his conviction on a charge of using a firearm during the commission of a felony. The two-year sentence, minus time served awaiting trial, must be served first.\n \n Before the shooting, Hooper had told Shelton that Shelton couldn't say anything to convince him to believe in God, according to police\n \n Shelton left the room, took off his shirt, shaved his face and tried again to convince Hooper there is a God. But at that point, Shelton had a 12-gauge shotgun.\n \n \"How long would it take you to believe in God?\" Shelton said he asked Hooper.\n \n \"Not until I hear Gabriel blow his horn,\" replied Hooper.\n \n Hooper tipped his hat and Shelton fired the shotgun at Hooper's head.\n \n \"I did it because he is evil; he was not a believer,\" Shelton said.\n \n Later, Shelton told cops he might have second thoughts about the existence of God. \"Maybe there's not\" a God, he said.\n \n But in his house that day, police could not persuade Shelton to come out the front door. He didn't want to pass Hooper's body because Hooper's \"evil soul\" might jump into him, Shelton later said, according to Schwartz.\n \n Bill found him guilty of second-degree murder but mentally ill, Guirguis said.\n \n Schwartz said religion wasn't the motive for the shooting.\n \n \"Shelton was a nut,\" said Schwartz.\n http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051229/CFP03/512290458 \n\n \n Note how after the entire article mentions God and religion in just about every sentence, and the person who did the killing surely seems to have done so because of the lack of religion in the victim, religion's role is downplayed at the very end. emoticon_xdonno\n \n And what the hell kind of sentence is 25 years for blowing someone's head off?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! Oh well, it was \"just an atheist\" who was killed after all. emoticon_mad",

Let's say that a Christian thinks God is directing him or her to blow up an abortion clinic or kill a doctor who performs abortions, and this Christian does in fact commit such a crime. In a September of 1984 edition of The 700 Club, Robertson suggested that special church tribunals could be called upon to discern if a believer had in fact received an authentic word from God which compelled him to break a civil law. According to Robertson, if this church tribunal did determine the believer had in fact received an authentic message from God -- how they could reach this conclusion without issuing God a suboena wasn't made clear -- then, Robertson said, the church tribunal would have the civil authority to provide the believer with immunity from prosecution.\"\n -- Gerard Thomas Straub, speech before the San Fernando Valley Chapter of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, September 11, 1995, quoted from Harry Schwartzbart, \"Pat Robertson Proposes Immunity From Prosecution For Criminals Who Commit Crimes On Instructions From God\"\n http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/quotes/jefframe.htm\n \n",

   "Well, as long as people aren't going to drop Hitler...\n \n \nWhen [Ann] Coulter's controversial remarks were published, American Atheists issued an Action Alert noting: \"It has become fashionable with some religious and political conservatives to blame the ills of modern society on Atheism, Humanism or some other form of nonbelief.\"\n \n The Alert noted that Hitler was born and raised in the Roman Catholic faith, admired Martin Luther (a staunch anti-Semite), and throughout his life time made numerous statements (some of them contradictory) about religion. \"It would be wrong to blame all Christianity or churches simply because of the deeds of one believer (Hitler, Torquemada\") noted the Alert. \"It is also wrong to stigmatize nonbelievers because of the actions of Pol Pot or Stalin. Any debate about the role of religion in our society should be based solidly on historical facts, not falsification and distortion.\"\n \n ...\n \n My personal copy of \"Mein Kampf\" is the complete, unabridged and annotated version published in 1940 by Renal & Hitchcock. It contains 23 references to Catholicism, most of which are in the annotations. There are statements, however, in \"Mein Kampf\" and elsewhere as well as documented events that clearly establish Hitler's attitude toward religion, Jesus Christ and Catholicism. In \"Mein Kampf\", for instance, Hitler wrote:\n \n **********************\n I am convinced that I am acting as the agent of our Creator. By fighting off \n the Jews, I am doing the Lord's work.\n **********************\n \n These same words were incorporated into a 1938 speech before the Riechstag. And in 1941, he told General Gerhard Engel:\n \n **********************\n I am now as before a Catholic and will always remain so.\n **********************\n \n Hitler clearly saw religion as a useful tool in consolidating and advancing power of the German state. He was not opposed to religion per se, only denominations and movements which stood in the way of his authority. In his January 1, 1934 New Year Message, Hitler remarked:\n \n **********************\n While we destroyed the (Catholic) Centre Party, we have not only brought \n thousands of priest back into the Church, but to millions of respectable people we have restored their faith in their religion and in their priests.\n **********************\n \n He spoke frequently for a reconciliation and unification between Protestantism and Rome, and praised the formation of an officially sanctioned Evangelical Church. Hitler also concluded a Concordant with the Vatican, boasting\n \n **********************\n This treaty shows the whole world clearly and unequivocally that the assertion that National Socialism is hostile to religion is a lie.\n **********************\n \n Other statements gleaned from speeches, letters, writings as well as memoirs and other second-hand accounts clearly demonstrate Hitler's disposition in respect to religious belief. ...\n \n ...\n \n Hitler was raised a Roman Catholic, saw the Vatican as a vital partner for his geopolitical schemes, recognized the role that both Catholicism and Protestantism had played in German history, and by his own words and writings saw himself as some kind of agent of Providence. His mission and crusade especially against the Jews was, in effect, \"doing the Lord's work\". His belief in his cosmic destiny became more pronounced with his early spectacular successes in foreign policy and military conquest, and later by events like the failed assassination attempt engineered by Count Claus Schenk von Sauffenberg, when Hitler \"miraculously\" survived a bomb explosion during a military planning session.\n \n Hitler is also a study in contradictions. Despite promoting what he dubbed \"positive Christianity\" - the \"Nazification\" of organized religious groups - Hitler likely did express disapproval of the more popular imagery of Jesus Christ. The Christian messiah was too flaccid, weak and merciful for the more rugged \"Blood and Soil\" battle cry Hitler and his henchmen sounded for the German nation. But he could also declare:\n \n **********************\n My feeling as a Christian points me to my Lord and Savior as a fighter. It \n points me to the man who once in loneliness, surrounded by only a few \n followers, recognized these Jews for what they were and summoned men to \n fight against them who, God's truth! was greatest not as a sufferer but as a \n fighter.\n **********************\n \n ...\n \n Hitler may not have been a paragon of Catholic virtue in all respects, but the Vatican never excommunicated him, and may well have concealed its own role in the extermination of the Jews and the \"war on Godless Bolshevism\". No sooner had the shots rung out in the Fuhrer Bunker under Berlin than the Vatican was busy shuttling Nazi and other Fascist criminals through the notorious \"Rat Line\" and to eventual safety in South America and other remote destinations.\n \n ...\n \n (Conrad Goeringer, Ask the Expert: Hitler, Christianity & Atheism, American Atheist Newsletter, September 2005, p5-8)\n \n",

   "The Alert noted that Hitler was born and raised in the Roman Catholic faith, admired Martin Luther (a staunch anti-Semite),\nSo he had a religious upbringing like basically everyone then, and admired a rabid anti-Semite. If he'd been a Catholic as later claimed Luther's theology would have been more important than his anti-Semitism\n and throughout his life time made numerous statements (some of them contradictory) about religion.\nYes. And the pro-Christian ones were overwhelmingly for public consumption. \n\"It would be wrong to blame all Christianity or churches simply because of the deeds of one believer (Hitler, Torquemada\") noted the Alert.\nTrue, because he wasn't a Christian \n\"It is also wrong to stigmatize nonbelievers because of the actions of Pol Pot or Stalin.\nTrue, because atheism can't be universally tarred with the same brush as Stalin: his problems were mostly political. \nAny debate about the role of religion in our society should be based solidly on historical facts, not falsification and distortion.\"\nThis I agree on. And from my studies of it (only at college level, but with some focus on the Church/State relationship) suggest that Hitler did absolutely nothing to support the Church except where he could benefit. He allied with the Catholic Centre on the promise of retaining Church youth groups and then abolished them. He caved into the Church opposing his eugenics, forced 'euthanasia' and more extreme anti-Semitism in public and continued them where he could in private, or after the Church was further weakened. He banned crucifixes in schools. There is no action I have come across in Hitler's life that supported the Church except for pragmatic reasons. I would also point out that Catholics were on average far more religiously active and involved, identifying themselves by religion, attending more services and having their own youth groups. They were also far less likely to vote for Hitler.",

   "This \"Hitler was a Christian\" is just another one of the anti-Christian bigot's vicious, ignorant, and hateful assaults on Christianity. For the record:\n \n Was Hitler a Christian?\n \n Hitler believed in telling the \"big lie,\" and there are some today who have been duped into continuing to propagate some of his lies. Specifically, I'm talking about Internet atheist types who--incredibly--assert that Adolf Hitler was a Christian. This notion can easily be dispelled by performing a very meager amount of research--which is exactly what I've done.\n \n I recently read the book Hitler's Cross, by Erwin W. Lutzer. The information contained in that book puts Hitler's \"Christianity\" in a very revealing light. I haven't double-checked Lutzer's sources, though the book seems quite trustworthy to me. But just to assure the reliability of my case I'll also quote from William Shirer's classic, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, which the New York Times called \"one of the most important works of history of our time\" and \"a splendid work of scholarship, objective in method, sound in judgment, inescapable in its conclusions.\"\n \n First of all, in order to determine whether Hitler was a Christian, we need to define \"Christian.\" If by Christian we mean someone who believes the words of Jesus and tries to follow them, then Hitler was absolutely, unquestionably not a Christian. But if by \"Christian\" we mean \"a person who claimed to be a Christian but whose real goal was to do away with Christianity and instead have himself revered as the most exalted being ever to walk the earth,\" then, well, Hitler was a Christian. But to define such a person as a Christian would be absurd. We might as well say that because Hitler wanted to conquer and devour Poland and France that he was a Pole or a Frenchman. \n \n The Hitler of Mein Kampf\n What did he believe in?\n \n Now it's true that in his youth Hitler must have had, at least for a time, some kind of Christian belief, since he tells us that as a boy he had a passing interest in becoming a clergyman. But that ended. At some time in his life Hitler apparently turned completely against Christianity. \n \n In Hitler's own words: \n \n \"[Making peace with the church] won't stop me from stamping out Christianity in Germany, root and branch. One is either a Christian or a German. You can't be both.\" (J. S. Conway, The Nazi Persecution of the Churches, quoted in Lutzer, pp. 113-114.) \n \n This is what Hitler was saying in private once he became Chancellor of Germany. So we know that at least by that time he was definitely not a believer in Christ. And yet at the same time Hitler was advocating what he called \"Positive Christianity.\" But what exactly did this \"Christianity\" consist of? Alfred Rosenberg, the man Hitler appointed as the philosophical guiding light in the Nazi party, drew up some plans for the \"National Reich Church.\" Here are some excerpts, from Shirer's Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: \n The National Church is determined to exterminate irrevocably...the strange and foreign Christian faiths imported into Germany in the ill-omened year of 800. \n \n The National Church demands immediate cessation of the publishing and dissemination of the Bible in Germany. \n \n The National Church declares that to it, and therefore to the German nation, it has been decided that the Fuehrer's Mein Kampf is the greatest of all documents. It...not only contains the greatest but it embodies the purest and truest ethics for the present and future life of our nation.\n \n The National Church will clear away from its altars all crucifixes, Bibles and pictures of saints.\n \n On the altars there must be nothing but Mein Kampf (to the German nation and therefore to God the most sacred book) and to the left of the altar a sword.\n \n On the day of its foundation, the Christian Cross must be removed from all churches, cathedrals and chapels...and it must be superseded by the only unconquerable symbol, the swastika. (Shirer, pp. 332-333.)\n \n Anyone who thinks this is Christianity has probably lived in a bunker all his life. \n \n Hitler did succeed in getting a great deal of control over the German Protestant church. The Protestants who embraced Hitler called themselves the \"German Christians.\" At one huge rally of these \"Christians\" a Dr. Krause spoke the following: \n \n ...the liberation from all that is un-German...from the Old Testament with its Jewish recompense ethic, from all these stories about cattle-dealers and pimps...Our provincial church will also have to see to it that all obviously distorted and superstitious reports should be expunged from the New Testament, and that the whole scapegoat and inferiority-type theology of the Rabbi Paul should be renounced in principle, for it has perpetuated a falsification of the gospel.\n \n Interesting understand of Christianity those Nazis had. A \"Christianity\" that rejects the Bible is a travesty, a fake Christianity.\n \n Dr. Hans Kerrl, Hitler's Minister for Church Affairs said this after meeting with a couple of church leaders: \n \n The party stands on the basis of Positive Christianity, and Positive Christianity is National Socialism [Nazism]...God's will reveals itself in German blood...Dr. Zoellner and Count Galen have tried to make clear to me that Christianity consists in faith in Christ as the Son of God. That makes me laugh...No, True Christianity is represented by the party, and the German people are now called by the party and especially by the Fuehrer to a real Christianity...The Fuehrer is the herald of a new revelation.\n \n Shove Christ aside and exalt the Fuehrer as the herald of a \"new revelation.\" \n \n Just another example of a cult using the name of Christianity as a front for their own self-invented belief system. \n \n But although the Nazi leaders talked about Christianity, did they really believe in even their own brand of Christianity without Christ? Well, here's what Shirer has to say: \n \n It would be misleading to give the impression that the persecution of Protestants and Catholics by the Nazi State tore the German people asunder or even greatly aroused the vast majority of them. It did not...Not many Germans lost much sleep over the arrests of a few thousand pastors and priests or over the quarreling of the various Protestant sects. And even fewer paused to reflect that under the leadership of Rosenberg, Bormann and Himmler, who were backed by Hitler, the Nazi regime intended eventually to destroy Christianity in Germany, if it could, and substitute the old paganism of the Nazi extremists. As Bormann, one of the men closest to Hitler, said publicly in 1941, \"National Socialism [Nazism] and Christianity and irreconcilable.\"\n \n Compliments Geocities.com\n \n Hitler a Christian? Oh the lies that the atheist's and anti-Christian bigots will believe.",

   "Adolph Hitler sought to turn the masses against any idealogy that Hitler and his henchmen thought a threat to him, his political office, and his own vision of a more pristine and \"intellectual\" Germany.\n \n Like Hitler, extremist atheists, like some seen around here, seek to build up a hostility and hatred against those groups (i.e. Christianity) that they perceive are a threat to their elitist worldview. While their numbers are small (about 4-5% of the American population or less are atheists), they nevertheless are very vocal in their condemnations. They seldom tell people the truth about the positive influences and actions of Christians and Christianity down through the ages - instead focusing their posts and attention on the negative. Once their hatred against particular religious groups is fanned and inflamed, can violence against these religious groups be far behind?? This is the Hitler mentality. \n \n They seek to turn the United States into a godless quagmire of relativistic morality. Despite the idealistic goals of atheistic liberalism, attempts to build a utopian liberal society in America have only led to heightened outbreaks of AIDS, VD, porno-related crime, social divisions, divorce, abortion, drug addictions, deficit spending, the welfare state, a crushing tax burden, the breakdown of the family unit, moral depravity, and numerous other such scourges which have resulted in enormous societal suffering and discontent. As a result, extremist atheism is strongly associated with left-wing fanaticism, reverse-racism, anti-intellectualism, elitism, nihilism, godlessness, and societal violence.",

Go look at the Christian crosses overlooking Normandy Beach. \n\n \n Okay, it's not like I have said anything that that contradicts.\n \n But note that prior to the WWII, Christianity was largely anti-semetic. And going farther back in time, Christianity gets more and more anti-semetic. \n \n If we stop our backward travel through time at the early American colonies, Christian persecution of Jews left them very little area they were welcomed. It was only in the religious tolerant areas (such as the Quaker-founded Pennsylvania) that Jews were welcome. And even here, guess who gets credit? One of the catalysts of the Enlightenment!\n \n \n\"The government of South Carolina rested on one of the most curious documents of colonial history, the \"Fundamental Constitution of Caroline\", drawn up by one of the proprietors, Lord Ashley-Cooper, with the help of his secretary, John Locke. ... The most enticing provision was a grant of religious toleration, designed to encourage immigration which gave South Carolina a greater degree of indulgence (extending even to Jews and heathens) than either England or any other colony except Rhode Island and, once it was established, Pennsylvania.\"\n (emphais added, America: A Narrative History: Sixth Edition, Vol 1, George Brown Tindall & David E. Shi, W. W. Norton, 2004, p80)\n \n\n \n Any idea why the authors stated that religious toleration extended EVEN TO JEWS? Why is it necessary to specifically single out JEWS (and heathens)? Because as a general rule, Jews were NOT welcome in the largely Christian, American colonies. Any religious toleration that did exist - and there wasn't too much of that either! - was that one Christian sect would tolerate another Christian sect. Jews (and \"heathens\") were outcasts, discriminated against and persecuted ... by the majority of Christians.\n \n \n \n ****************************\n Speaking of American history. How many of us remember this little myth from our high school days. \"The people who settled the American coloines were fleeing from religious persecution in England. And once the colonists reached the shores of North America, they were free to worship as they pleased.\"\n \n That's rubbish. \n \n 1) The FIRST English colonies in American were not populated with people fleeing religious persecution in England. Jamestown, for example, had transplanted the Church of England to the colonies: they RETAINED their established church, and established it here in the Virginia colony. It was the Puritans and Separatists - which, a dozen or more years later, founded Massachusettes Bay and Plymouth, respectively - who fled England religous persecution. \n \n 2) The colonies were very INTOLERANT of other religous sects. Here's one example.\n \n \n\"And while Puritans pleaded for religious freedom in England, in New England they denied any such liberty to those whose faith did not conform to Congregational Puritanism. Writing at the end of the seventeeth century, the Lord Bishop of Salisbury noted the relation between religious freedom and political power. 'Every party cries out for Liberty & toleration,' he said, 'till they get to be uppermost, and then will allow none. Witness those of N[ew] E[ngland] where they have sufficiently proved the Truth of the Doctrine & have showed their tenderness to dissenters in the plainest manner by Acting such Cruelties, which are hardly to be paralleled in Heathen persecutions.'\" (The Founding Fathers and the Place of Religion in America, Frank Lambert, Princeton University Press, 2003, p76) \n",

   "EasyRider: Like Hitler, extremist atheists, like some seen around here, seek to build up a hostility and hatred against those groups (i.e. Christianity) that they perceive are a threat to their elitist worldview. While their numbers are small (about 4-5% of the American population or less are atheists), they nevertheless are very vocal in their condemnations. They seldom tell people the truth about the positive influences and actions of Christians and Christianity down through the ages - instead focusing their posts and attention on the negative. Once their hatred against particular religious groups is fanned and inflamed, can violence against these religious groups be far behind?? This is the Hitler mentality. \n \n They seek to turn the United States into a godless quagmire of relativistic morality. Despite the idealistic goals of atheistic liberalism, attempts to build a utopian liberal society in America have only led to heightened outbreaks of AIDS, VD, porno-related crime, social divisions, divorce, abortion, drug addictions, deficit spending, the welfare state, a crushing tax burden, the breakdown of the family unit, moral depravity, and numerous other such scourges which have resulted in enormous societal suffering and discontent. As a result, extremist atheism is strongly associated with left-wing fanaticism, reverse-racism, anti-intellectualism, elitism, nihilism, godlessness, and societal violence.\n\n \n My my my.

They have no purpose beyond this accidental occurence. A purposeful existence implies something that has the ability to have a purpose. In other words, for humans to have an actual purpose there must be a being that had a purpose in putting humans here. Regardless whether people cosider that to be God, or some other creative purposeful being. Atheism denies the existence of this force. Therefore humans have no more purpose than anything or anyone else. Therefore, why should a human life be valued? The word valued is important. Value is a judgment (by definition mind you). If humans have no value any more than anything else then value is meaningless. \n \n It is like in the movie Rainman, when tom cruise took dustin hoffman to see a doctor in the small town and the dr. called him autistic. The doc then asked hoffman how much a candy bar costs and he replied \"about a hundred dollars\" and how much a car cost \"about a hundred dollars\". He could not understand value. Why? NOt because he didn't understand value but simply because nothing had value. A car equals a candy bar equals toilet paper equals a chalet in the alps. No value.

   "... Therefore humans have no more purpose than anything or anyone else. Therefore, why should a human life be valued?...\n\n \n You error lies between those sentences. The thrust of your 'purpose' argument revolves around humans having a 'purpose' imposed upon them by some other agency - a purpose which that agency devised, and for the fulfillment of which it created humankind. If we deny that such an agency exists, we deny such an externally imposed purpose, certainly; but to segue from that to 'why should a human life be valued?' is a gigantic non sequitur.\n \n Consider the hypothesis that human consciousness evolved as a survival strategem, and did so in small hunter-gatherer bands of closely related people. In that case, human life - your fellow band-members' life - will be enormously valued; firstly because they are your kin, and if their genes persist so do yours; and secondly because you are a beneficiary of their ongoing labours.\n \n You will perhaps argue that this is an argument based on self-interest, and unworthy of humans' higher aspirations. I can only reply that it accurately describes human behaviour throughout history and ethnography: we are innately disposed to divide the world into 'them and us', and we value the lives of 'us' many times more than the lives of 'them'. (If you doubt me, check to see where in your local paper a train crash in India figures. Page 6? A single paragraph AP report? Then ask yourself where it would have figured had it occurred with comparable loss of life in your state.)\n \n A problem faced by those of us who argue in this way is the confusion between is and ought. Evolutionary biologists who try to describe how things are are often accused of having an unstated sub-text 'and therefore that's how things ought to be'. This is unjust. We are as a species heavily pre-disposed toward the us/them dichotomy; our evolution has made us so. If the word ought means anything in this context, it has to be whatever brings the greatest good to the greatest number of people. We live in a globalised world. Attitudes and behaviours which were adaptive to warring hunter-gatherer bands in the Early Palaeolithic are now an obstacle to our collective survival. We need to turn our backs on our us-and-them predisposition; but this will not be made easier by pretending that such a predisposition does not exist.",

But then that would be comparing apples to oranges! The religious convictions I presented (and the many more I haven't) are all recent, showing that the problem is large. Thus anything you are going to offer as comparable must also be recent, to maintain relevance: if your examples are thinly scattered across the past 200 years you are hardly showing antying comparable to what I have shown.\n \n You also don't have any logic to back up your side. School teachers are free to have sex: many religious leaders aren't. So although it makes sense to say Abstinence Makes the Church Grow Fondlers, it doesn't make sense to say that about school teachers.\n \n We also have many examples of 'the church' covering up the acts of sexual misconduct by its priests etc., and also simply transferring the guilty child molesters to other regions where they can start all over again!

For the reason the killing was being done, many of the people were INNOCENT that were killed.\n \n And the bishop or abbot - and the people carrying out his command - KNEW that they would be slaughtering thousands of INNOCENT men, women, and children, in their quest to eliminate the few \"guilty\". But they JUSTIFIED their atrocity - their mass murder of thousands of innocent men, women, and children - based on their Christian beliefs: \"Kill them all, God knows his own\" (or as is more often heard, \"Kill them all and let God sort them out\").

That's bad.\n \n Religion 'steals' money from people's pockets. That's bad.\n \n Religion robs people of their time. That's bad.\n \n Religion attempts to control people's minds. That's bad.\n \n Many religious people lie about evolution, geology, and other science, because of their religious beliefs That's bad.\n \n Many religious people try to force their religious Creation myths into public school science classes, because of their religious beliefs. That's bad.\n \n Many religious people lie about American History, because of their religious beliefs. That's bad.\n \n Many religious people try to stuff their religious lifestyle down the throats of the American people through manipulating politics. That's bad.\n \n And so on.\n \n \n \n Yes, I view religion in general as being bad: very bad. However, I would not want to just abolish it. My views are that:\n \n \n 1) The way things are, many people need the \"psychological crutch\" known as religion. Without it, they'd \"lose it\" during hard times.\n \n IF it were possible to replace the \"crutches\" of religion - to convince everyone that they in fact do NOT need the psychological crutch: that there really is nothing \"out there\" helping them through their tough times: that, in reality, it is actually all their own doing, their own ability to cope - then this \"psychological crutch\" barrier would not be an issue.\n \n \n 2) The way things are, many people need the moral foundations they BELIEVE can only be derived from religion. This is a flawed idea. For example, the Divine Command Theory of ethics is fatally flawed. Besides, as I have shown, many religious people commit grossly immoral acts, so the moral foundations of religion must not be working too good! And of course, there are non-religious people who live moral, upright lives. Also, read through the Old Testament and you'll find tons of religious people committing grossly immoral acts: hell, even GOD does!\n \n IF it were possible to make all people see that the basis for morals does not have to come from religion, but can rather come from their shared humanity, then the \"moral foundations\" barrier would be eliminated.\n \n \n \n Sadly, it simply isn't feasible - especially not with churches indoctrinating little ones \"right out of the crib\"! - to change the minds of America. It isn't feasible to get them all to accept (1) their own ability to cope with life's bad times and (2) the fact that morals can be based on our shared humanity instead of on religion. Thus, BECAUSE THINGS ARE THE WAY THEY ARE, I believe that flat-out abolishing religion would be bad for society. The absence of religion does not HAVE to be bad for society, but the way things are, it would be.\n \n \n \nObvious Child: I would never apply this to all atheists: I'm essentially atheistic myself. Only zealots of any side have that sort of aim. You have all the zeal and fury of the convert: are you a born-again atheist by any chance?\n\n \n Already covered. I'll restate it again though. It's a bit, well, dramatic, but I do hold to the general ideas expressed.\n \n \n \n \n Concerning my bitterness and resentment towards those who formerly enslaved my mind, not to mention my wallet and time...\n \n \n\"Although there are no hard numbers that I have ever seen, it is presumable that most Atheists are not natural Atheists but 'born-again' Atheists - people who have been through the conversion experience and who have 'deconverted' or 'reconverted' back to their original Atheism. However, born-again Atheism must be different from natural Atheism because of the experiences that have transpired in the life of the recovered Atheist. Above all, the recoverted Atheist is a former Theist, so he or she has lived that life, believed those beliefs, been part of that community and that world. I can honestly say that I do not know what that is like. But I know from my friendships with (and in one case, marriage to) former Theists that the experience was not always pleasant and the transition back to Atheism, although not always sudden and traumatic, was often painful and difficult but ultimately liberating. Born-again Atheists possess an intimate knowledge of religion from the inside, but the price of that knowledge is often an anger or bitterness toward those who indoctrinated them and the doctrines they were coerced to conform to. But almost universally, the benefit of deconversion is an experience - sometimes for the first time - of liberation and of the right to claim one's mind for oneself.\n (bold and italics added, Natural Atheism, David Eller, American Atheist Press, 2004, p12) \n\n \n I and other atheists who deconverted from Christianity have reasons to feel bitterness and resentment towards those who formerly enslaved our minds. Christians manipulated us, playing on our emotions and deceiving us, with the fundamentalists being the most guilty. For example, while using their grand stage theatrics, they scared us into 'believing' by preaching of fire and brimstone, and of the horrid misery and eternal torment we'd endure in hell, if we didn't believe. They manipulated us through deceit: they cherry picked only the most righteous passages for their sermons, never mentioning the slaughters of innocent women and children - commanded by God - or the incest, rapes, incestuous rapes, murders, and so on, found in their Holy Bible; they falsely claimed that the Bible is the inerrant Word of the Almighty God, containing not even one contradiction; they spewed out half-truths and/or outright lies about evolution; and so on. \n \n The Christians controlled our minds by manipulating our emotions and deceiving us, all the while demanding our money, and our time. We were \"mentally raped\" and we were robbed: they abused their position of authority. And once freed from the shackles of religious mind control, what were we able to finally see? That we were manipulated, misled and abused for ... a bunch of fairy tales! \n \n It is logical that the greater the degree of manipulation Christians used to exert their mind control over us, the greater the degree of resentment and bitterness we have toward our oppressors once freed. Escapees from a fundamentalist church are the most \"mentally abused\" of them all, and bare the worst scars. \n \n We atheists that deconverted - especially from a fundamentalist church - have good reason to feel bitterness and resentment towards the Christians who controlled us; and, in fact, towards all Christians who wish to control this country - or the world! - by trying to force their God and their Jesus down everyone's throats.\n \n \n \n PS: Obvious Child, if you've made it this far, note that I probably won't respond to anything you say. I start school again tomorrow night so won't have (much) time to be posting on the Internet.",

The thrust of your 'purpose' argument revolves around humans having a 'purpose' imposed upon them by some other agency - a purpose which that agency devised, and for the fulfillment of which it created humankind. If we deny that such an agency exists, we deny such an externally imposed purpose, certainly; but to segue from that to 'why should a human life be valued?' is a gigantic non sequitur.\n \n Consider the hypothesis that human consciousness evolved as a survival strategem, and did so in small hunter-gatherer bands of closely related people. In that case, human life - your fellow band-members' life - will be enormously valued; firstly because they are your kin, and if their genes persist so do yours; and secondly because you are a beneficiary of their ongoing labours.\n \n You will perhaps argue that this is an argument based on self-interest, and unworthy of humans' higher aspirations. I can only reply that it accurately describes human behaviour throughout history and ethnography: we are innately disposed to divide the world into 'them and us', and we value the lives of 'us' many times more than the lives of 'them'. (If you doubt me, check to see where in your local paper a train crash in India figures. Page 6? A single paragraph AP report? Then ask yourself where it would have figured had it occurred with comparable loss of life in your state.)\n \n A problem faced by those of us who argue in this way is the confusion between is and ought. Evolutionary biologists who try to describe how things are are often accused of having an unstated sub-text 'and therefore that's how things ought to be'. This is unjust. We are as a species heavily pre-disposed toward the us/them dichotomy; our evolution has made us so. If the word ought means anything in this context, it has to be whatever brings the greatest good to the greatest number of people. We live in a globalised world. Attitudes and behaviours which were adaptive to warring hunter-gatherer bands in the Early Palaeolithic are now an obstacle to our collective survival. We need to turn our backs on our us-and-them predisposition; but this will not be made easier by pretending that such a predisposition does not exist.\n\n \n I think you are generally correct in much of what you say. However there are problems you did not anticipate in this post. For example, self interest is certainly recognized as a large part of human history, however, it does not allow for the individual who chooses their own anhiliation (sp?) for the good of ONE other, not the greatest good for the most but for ONE. The us and them mentality is not the be all of existence for most humans. Most would not die for their enemy but some have! See the movie \"To End All Wars.\" an excellent film and a true story. One man named \"Dusty\" died in the place of another prisoner who had turned him in and had caused them all to suffer great harm. He was generally hated. Yet he chose to die for him. \n \n Second, to carry the discussion a bit further, if value is strictly individualized, subjective by definition, then this is where Wars actually come from. This is indeed what atheism promotes. By saying that purpose is derived internally as opposed to an external standard one necessarily states the subjectivity of the value of humans. If that is the case then the largest most powerful group gets to decide value which then fluctuates. To declare value from an external source provides value indeed to all equally. The evolutionary atheist would say that people should not be valued equally. \n \n Remember, that my arguement is not that one side is true and the other false, merely that the position of the atheist necessarily leads to a devaluing of humans.\n \n EF",

   "Was Daniel a Prophet?\n \n Many today, including many Jews, say no. What does history have to say, however?\n \n The Rabbis on Daniel\n \n Rabbi Judah, the main compiler of the Talmud said regarding the times referred to in Daniel's (Messianic) prophecy, \"These times were over long ago.\" (Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin.) \n \n \n Rabbi Moses Abraham Levi said, \"I have examined and searched all the Holy Scriptures and have not found the time for the coming of Messiah clearly fixed, except in the words of Gabriel to the prophet Daniel, which are written in the 9th chapter of the prophecy of Daniel.\" \n \n From Maimonede's Sixth Principle of Faith: \n \n \"Third, when a prophet receives prophecy, even though it was only a vision and by means of an angel, he would nevertheless be weakened by it and his body would shudder. He would be stricken with a very great fear almost to the point that his spirit would leave his body, as Daniel said when [the angel] Gavriel (Gabriel) spoke to him, \"No strength remained in me; my robustness changed to pallor, and I could retain no strength... and I was in a deep sleep upon my face, and my face was to the ground\". And as he says later, \"during the vision my joints shuddered and I could retain no strength\". (Daniel 10:8-9, 16). But Moshe, may he rest in peace, was not so, rather, the word came to him and he did not experience trembling and shivering in any way, as it says, \"And HaShem spoke to Moshe face to face, as a man speaks to his friend\" (Shemos [Exodus] 33:11). In other words, just as a man does not experience trembling from the speech of his fellow, Moshe did not tremble from the word even though it was face to face. This was due to his total attachment to the intellect, as we said earlier.\" \n \n The \"Prophet Daniel\" found in the Dead Sea Scrolls:\n \n \"Comment: It is interesting to note that every chapter of Daniel is represented in these manuscripts, except for Dan 12. However, this does not mean that the Book lacked the final chapter at Qumran, since Dan 12:10 is quoted in the Florilegium (4Q174) - (Dead Sea Scrolls), which explicitly tells us that 'it is written in the Book of Daniel the Prophet.' \n \n Jesus confirms Daniel is a Prophet\n \n The Lord Jesus Christ spoke of Daniel \"the prophet\" (Matthew 24:15; Mark 13:14). \n \n Alexander the Great and Daniel\n \n JOSEPHUS [Antiquities, 11.8.5] mentions that Alexander the Great had designed to punish the Jews for their fidelity to Darius, but that Jaddua (332 B.C.), the high priest, met him at the head of a procession and averted his wrath by showing him Daniel's prophecy that a Grecian monarch should overthrow Persia. Certain it is, Alexander favored the Jews, and JOSEPHUS' statement gives an explanation of the fact; at least it shows that the Jews in JOSEPHUS' days believed that Daniel was extant in Alexander's days, long before the Maccabees. \n \n The Talmud refers to Daniel as a Prophet\n \n i.e. \"Hatach.\" Hatach is another name for the prophet Daniel. He was called Hatach (related to the Hebrew word for \"cut\") because he was \"cut down,\" demoted from his position of greatness, which he held at the courts of the previous kings (Megillah 15a). http://www.virtualpurim.org/scripts/tgij/paper/IndexPurim.asp?ArticleID=1436&Cat=Megillah",

Numerous Christians accepted numerous forged and \"heretical\" writings before the New Testament was canonized in the 4th century CE.\n \n Also, Daniel's knowledge of ~200 BCE was much better than his knowledge of ~600 BCE. Here's a bit on this, from an author explaining where \"Mark\" got some of his \"mindset\" from:\n \n \n\"The Book of Daniel presents itself as having been written in the sixth century B.C.E., during the reign of the Babylonian ruler Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar and the Persians Cyrus and Darius. From that point in time it presents itself as predicting events in the ancient Near East during the fifth, fourth, third, and second centuries B.C.E. But strangely, whenever Daniel talks about the sixth century it is vague and inaccurate, and when it talks about the second century it is quite detailed and exact. This gives us a clue as to its actual time of writing. With regard to the sixth century B.C.E., the book opens by declaring:\n \n ********************************\n In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and laid siege to it. The Lord delivered Jehoiakim king of Judah into his power, together with all that was left of the vessels of the house of God; and he carried them off to the land of Shinar.\n (1:1-2)\n ********************************\n \n But in fact Jehoiakim reigned for eleven years; it was only in the first year of his son and successor Jehoiachin that Nebuchadnezzar laid siege to Jerusalem, captured it, and \"carried off all the treasures of the house of the Lord\" (see Kings 28:8-13). The author of Daniel is quite weak on his facts about the sixth century B.C.E., and continues to be so in his account of the fall of Babylon to Persia in the year 539. He writes that \"Belshazzar king of the Chaldaeans was slain, and Darius the Mede took the kingdom\" (Dan. 5:30). But of course it was Cyrus the Persian who conquered Babylon (see Ezra 1:1); there never was a King Darius in Mede. The author of Daniel confusedly imagines him in place of Darius the Persian, who succeeded Cyrus' son Cambyses in 521 B.C.E. The author of Daniel also confusedly imagines that Cyrus succeeded Darius (though Darius in fact succeeded Cyrus' son), and imagines that Belshazzar was the son of Nebuchadnezzar (5:11), though he was in fact the son of Nabonidus (see ABD IV, 973). Nabonidus, in turn, was \"not related to any of his predecessors\" (ABD IV, 973), including Nebuchadnezzar; so the author of the Book of Daniel was ignorant even of the lineage of the ruler, Belshazzar, in whose court Daniel was said to be \"chief among the magicians\" (5:11). Thus it ought not surprise the attentive reader of the Book of Daniel that modern critical scholars of the Bible are unanimous in their conviction that Daniel \"actually comes from the 2nd century B.C.E.\" (ABD II, 33) and that its pretense of coming from the sixth century is a literary fiction intended to impress its readers with the supposed accuracy of its foreknowledge of the next several hundred years.\" \n (Who Wrote The Gospels?, Randel McCraw Helms, 1997, p20-21) \n\n \n Oh, and you can spare me the \"You'll burn in hell for this\" routine emoticon_xangel",

   "More frightening religous statements come straight from the Bible. How about a quick look at Exodus.\n \n 1) Moses was a little baby. Immediately after the baby-in-a-basket story what is the first thing are we are told about Moses? HE KILLS SOMEONE! \n \n \nOne day, when Moses had grown up, he went out to where his own people were and watched them at their hard labor. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his own people. Glancing this way and that and seeing no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.\n (Exodus 2:11-12)\n \n\n \n \n 2) God is the one who makes people blind, deaf, and mute. Don't believe me? Speaking to Moses...\n \n \nThe LORD said to him, \"Who gave man his mouth? Who makes him deaf or mute? Who gives him sight or makes him blind? Is it not I, the LORD?\" \n (Exodus 4:11)\n \n\n \n \n 3) I assume most people are familiar with the Moses/Phraraoh/Set My People Free story. The really short version: God tells Moses to go to Pharaoh and tell him to let the Israelites go, and Moses does. Pharaoh doesn't listen. So God starts telling Moses to do this or that plague so that Pharaoh will listen and let the Israelites go. But Pharaoh pigheadedly refuses. Yep, in general, after each plague is inflicted on Pharoh and his kingdom - be it all the waters turning into blood, swarms of locust, complete darkness during the day, or any of the many other - Pharaoh says he will let the Israelites go, but then once relief is in sight, changes his mind back to NOT letting them go. Finally, because Pharaoh would not listen, God inflicts the final plague: the death of all the first born in Egypt. Nice God, huh. Oh, but God is MUCH worse than that makes it sound. Here's why.\n \n God says BEFORE Moses starts his mission that He will not LET Pharaoh let the Israelites go.\n \n \nThe LORD said to Moses, \"When you return to Egypt, see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders I have given you the power to do. But I will harden his heart so that he will not let the people go. Then say to Pharaoh, 'This is what the LORD says: Israel is my firstborn son, and I told you, \"Let my son go, so he may worship me.\" But you refused to let him go; so I will kill your firstborn son.'\"\n (Exodus 4:21-23)\n \n\n \n Yes, the Bible tells us that God Himself will prevent Pharaoh from letting the Israelites go, then turn right around and punish Pharaoh by killing his firstborn son! \n \n But it's worse, because God does not kill just Pharaoh's firstborn son, but ALL of the Egyptians' firstborns!\n \n Oh, but perhaps the Bible just messed up somehow: maybe it doesn't repeat that God hardened Pharaoh's heart. Nope. The Bible says it MULTIPLE times.\n \n \nThen the LORD said to Moses, \"... But I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and though I multiply my miraculous signs and wonders in Egypt, he will not listen to you.\"\n (excerpts from Exodus 7:1-5) \n \n\n \n We see again that God hardened Pharaoh's heart in Exodus 9:12, and Exodus 10:1-2, and Exodus 10:20, and Exodus 10:27, and back in (a verse not quoted here before) Exodus 4:10!\n \n God FORCED Pharaoh to do something, then turned around and punished him and all of Egypt for it! And God PLANNED this all out ahead of time!\n \n \n Oh, but there's still more. After Pharaoh finally let's the Israelites go, GOD AGAIN HARDENS PHARAOH'S HEART TO FORCE HIM TO PURSUE THE ISRAELITES! This is said twice in Exodus 14:1-9, and again in Exodus 14:15-18. And what is God's purpose for having Pharaoh and his army pursue the Israelites? FOR GOD TO GAIN GLORY THROUGH HIS KILLING THEM ALL! \n \n And then, after God has killed all the Egyptians - which He, the puppet master FORCED to do what they did - all the Israelites start singing about how wonderful God is!!!\n \n \nThen Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the LORD:\n \n \"I will sing to the LORD,\n for he is highly exalted.\n The horse and its riders\n he has hurled into the sea.\n ...\n The LORD is a warrior;\n The LORD is his name.\n Pharaoh's chariots and his army\n he has hurled into the sea.\n The best of Pharaoh's officers\n are drowned in the Red Sea.\n The deep waters have covered them;\n they sank to the depths like a stone.\n \n ...\n You unleashed your burning anger;\n it consumed them like stubble.\n (Exodus 15:1-7)\n \n\n \n Sadistic little so and so's. And there God too!",

   "This \"gay thing\" seems to be a big issue at these boards. Let me throw in my two cents worth.\n \n Several things have recently swayed me towards favoring the gay viewpoint (not the gay lifestyle, mind you!).\n \n 1) First, I have always found gay sex between men disgusting (but like many or most men, I find gay sex between two good looking women to be a strong turn on; to be extremely stimulating and erotic and wonderful and exicting and fascinating and sensual and ... schwing! ... excuse me for a few minutes, I'll be right back ........ ah, now that that's taken care of!). But then I heard a comedian say something that sounded half way reasonable. This is a paraphrase: \"I find sex between an old wrinkly man and an old liver-spotted woman disgusting too, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't be allowed to be married.\" There's a kernel of wisdom in there!\n \n 2) Second, I find the weak, Biblically based arguments and the general bigotry towards the gays seen here to push me away from the 'Christian' side and towards the gay side (again, the gays' position on gay rights, not over to the gay lifestyle).\n \n 3) I recently saw a clip (looked dated, like from the 80s or something) of a TV evangelist who said that gay sex should be a CAPITAL OFFENSE! Gay sex punishable by death!??! Are religious 'leaders' like this dude serious?!?!?! \n \n I am still what one would wrongly label a homophobe (that term is a misnomer, as I do not fear gays: I find gay sex, between men, to be digusting: that's not what the term homophobe implies), yet I feel that if I were to vote on the issue now that I'd cast my vote in favor of gay marriage.",

If you look closely at the Aramaic it does not say Bar Enash but rather K'var Enash ( &#1499;&#1489;&#1512; &#1488;&#1504;&#1513; ) which says \"Like a son of man\" many Christians ignore the Kaf ( &#1499; ) and immediately seize the phrase bar enash to be pointing to jesus. Is that really what the phrase says? The phrase itself is a similie which is a comparison using like or as. This phrase here is comparing something to a \"son of man.\" What this is, is not exactly explained nor is it given but many have said this is talking about the nation of Israel or an angelic figure. Most probably it is comparing the Nation of Israel. Nowhere in the GNT is jesus ever called \"like a son of man.\" To associate the two would be pointless and undoable since it(\"like a son of man\") is never used for jesus.\n \n 2) Now I would like to discuss what Rashi said. Rashi said this was about King Messiah. How would he have arrived to this conclusion. My thought is that he was not looking at the \"like a son of man\" part but rather the rest of the verse and comparing it to the Aramaic Targum Onkelos of Genesis 49:10. Rashi was taking the part of \"14. And there he was given dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him; his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom one that shall not be destroyed. He compared this to this:\n \n Genesis 49:10(Targum Onkelos):\n \n \"The ability to exercise dominion shall not pass away from the house of Judah, nor the sceptor from his children's children for ever, even when the Messiah comes to whom the kingdom belongs, and to him shall be the obedience of the nations (or, whom the peoples shall obey).\n \n The Aramaic text for Genesis 49:10:\n \n Genesis 49:10(Targum Onkelos)\n &#1497;)&#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497; &#1506;&#1489;&#1491; &#1513;&#1500;&#1496;&#1503; &#1502;&#1491;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1492; &#1493;&#1505;&#1508;&#1512;&#1488; &#1502;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497; &#1489;&#1504;&#1493;&#1492;&#1497; &#1506;&#1491; &#1488;&#1500;&#1502;&#1488; &#1491;&#1497;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; &#1502;&#1513;&#1497;&#1495;&#1488; &#1491;&#1491;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492; &#1492;&#1497;&#1488; &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514;&#1488; &#1493;&#1500;&#1492; &#1497;&#1513;&#1514;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1503; &#1506;&#1502;&#1502;&#1497;&#1488;.\n \n Here we can see Rashi was associating the words Dominion (&#1513;&#1500;&#1496;&#1503;) and Kingdom (&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514;&#1488;) and (&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514;&#1492;) and also the word for Nations/Peoples (&#1506;&#1502;&#1502;&#1497;&#1488;) which is used in both Daniel 7:14 and Genesis 49:10(Targum Onkelos). That I believe is the rationale that Rashi was using when he was associating this with the King Messiah.\n \n 3) Many other commentators like to place this verse as to relating to the nation of Israel. For example they place the \"Like a son of man\" as personification of the Nation of Israel just as it has before (Exodus 4:22). In Exodus 4:22 Israel is called \"G-d's first-born son\" and is personified all through the Tanakh as a male child.\n \n \n Me personally I think that the nation of Israel fits in better with \"like a son of man\" since it is a similie comparing it to something that is not a man but rather \"like a man\". I can also see Rashi's point about how this can be about King Messiah once the reason and the association is outlined.\n \n",

You are doing exactly what you (and I) have often accused EZrider of doing. The point of the surrounding scripture is that God is not like man in that God does not lie. There are numerous points of scripture where man is said to be like God and where God and man share attributes. If scripture cannot contradict itself, which is one of the proper hermaneutical rules, then this scripture must mean that God is not talking about Jesus in saying he is not the son of man. Rather, the explanation that what is being spoken of here is the nature of God to not lie .\n \n This is a proper principle to apply to anyone anywhere anytime. You must take it in context of the whole. There are many who have pointed out that the bible actually says \"There is no God.\" The bible does indeed say that. But lets put it in context, \"The fool in his heart says, 'There is no God'.\" Taking something out of context of the normal usage of it at the time and within the chapter, the book, and scripture as a whole, is just poor analysis.\\\n \n EF",

   "Can you find just one or will the doorknob suffocate waiting for you too?\n\n \n I'll highlight the most noteworthy parts, but you might want to read the whole thing.\n \n \nOne very important thing to remember is that there are significant limitations to newspaper stories as a database. Because some events are more newsworthy than others, there is no way to know for sure how representative newspaper reports of molestation are of general child sexual abuse. It is also unknown whether the types of molestations most likely to 'hit' the papers \u00d1 those by persons in authority over children \u00d1 accurately reflect molestation rates by those same authority figures. Does an environment where one regularly works with children encourage more temptation? Is a position of authority \u00d1 with its tendency to be under greater scrutiny \u00d1 associated on average with more responsible or less responsible behavior? Does a position of trust over children allow individuals to slip 'under the radar' more easily and lessen suspicion of them as potential molesters?\n <snip<\n Because newspapers have a bias toward reporting on 'newsworthy' individuals, we can't look only at clergy and make a reasonable conclusion about how often they molest. Again, in terms of the overall molestation picture, the rates for clergy extracted from the database of newspaper stories are likely to be overstated relative to the general public, especially given their position of authority. So we also need a comparison group that is similarly educated and with ready access to children. Here, teachers naturally come to mind. \n <snip<\n The media attention to homosexual rape of children by Roman Catholic Priests probably biased its child molestation stories by elevating the number of stories about molestation by priests. Many of the stories involving priests concerned rapes that took place decades before the newspaper story appeared. While some stories about preachers and teachers who raped children also concerned events that occurred many years ago, the volume of homosexual rapes by priests seems seriously inflated by the media attention to the issue. \n <snip<\n ...The media, however, has made the actions of a few pedophile priests the main problem. Bad as it is, the main problem of errant priestly crimes is not in the area of pedophilia, which is strictly defined as an adult having sexual relations with someone below the age of puberty (12), but rather in the phenomena of priests with homosexual inclinations seeking out vulnerable youth. The secular press refuses to recognize that these priests are actively homosexual, not pedophiles.... Although one priest involved in sexual relations with teenage boys is one priest too many, still it should be stressed that the number of priests who have seduced teenage boys is a very small percentage of the 47,000 odd priests in the U.S.A. One report said that 177 priests throughout the USA have been removed from ministry. This of course is the source of serious scandal, which is made even greater by the anger of Catholic laity, who hold that our bishops have covered up these situations, and have made immense payments to settle law suits made by victims and their families. But one may ask whether our bishops as a body have been judged too harshly by both the media and our Catholic laity. \n <snip<\n As we have seen in recent years, the media strongly favor the homosexual agenda, so it's likely that their figures are skewed even more than this writer suggests. The media are very reluctant these days to run stories that might harm the homosexual PR project.\n\n \n http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/918042/posts",

   "epaphras_faith does have a valid point. Anyplace where there are adults that are in a position of authority over vulnerable populations, you will have such kind of abuses.\n \n Although, I would like to know why a congregation would be considered a 'vulnerable' population (except for the childen as religious school of course).\n\n \n Thank you. \n \n A congregation is not just a gathering of people on sunday. Children are left in the care of adults, many adults receive counseling through the church as do children. That would also point out another vulnerable group. Those that receive counseling from psychologists, psychiatrists and social workers. Also anyone who sees a person alone for intimate issues (a physician, nurse etc.)\n \n as to DoG's comments about what other groups, I refer to my other post which clearly highlights vulnerable populations besides religious environments. Nursing homes workers and teachers show up quite often.\n \n DamEtal: Please answer the question. What is the purpose of your posting?",

   "Volume 34, No. 1 January 2003 \n \n \n \n \n \n Study explores how religion influences people's ability to cope \n Print version: page 16 \n Spouses of lung cancer patients who used moderate levels of religious coping--such as prayer or seeking comfort in faith and from church member--were less depressed than those who used lower or higher levels of religious coping, according to a new study appearing in the November/December issue of Psychosomatics (Vol. 43, No. 6). \n \n Spouses, who are often placed in the caregiver role after a diagnosis of cancer in their partner, can be vulnerable to depression and can find help in religion and spirituality, says Alexis D. Abernethy, PhD, lead author on the study and an associate professor at the Graduate School of Psychology at Fuller Theological Seminary. \n \n In the study, depression was found to be lowest among spouses who used religious coping in moderation. Other types of coping that may be valuable for spouses include comfort from family and friends, support groups or literature. \n \n The research is part of a larger study led by Paul Duberstein, PhD, at University of Rochester Medical Center that looks at the adjustment to lung cancer diagnosis and treatment. \n \n Researchers evaluated 156 spouses for their level of religious coping, symptoms of depression, self-efficacy, level of social support and sense of control over events. The spouses' loved ones had been diagnosed with lung cancer within the previous five years. Seventy-eight percent of the spouses were women. \n \n However, says Abernethy, those who rely on religion in an excessive way might become more vulnerable to higher levels of depression because they might neglect other coping strategies or might already be dealing with depression. \n \n \"As they are faced with a stressful situation, they may then over-rely on religious coping,\" she says. \"Religious coping is helpful but other types of coping are also important in the context of facing such a serious illness in a spouse.\" \n \n While the study did not measure the differences among the specific types of religious coping, Abernethy says preliminary analyses of some of the spouses' responses provided some insight regarding the type of religious coping that could potentially have a negative effect. For instance, spouses whose loved ones were diagnosed with cancer might feel less support from God and others and feel more discontent spiritually. \"The kind of coping that has a more negative or punitive tone could also explain why that type of religious coping is associated with depression,\" she says. \n \n Abernethy, whose research interests lie in the area of spirituality and health, says, \"It is important to understand how religious coping and other dimensions of religiousness may or may not be helpful in disease and health.\" \n \n --M.

   "I doubt you'll find a group more inclined to abuse children than the RC clergy. The very idea that man(woman) can successfully suppress a naturally occurring, hardly resistable urge to have the ultimate physical pleasures of orgasm is the epitome of STUPID.\n \n I think it stems from the arrogance of the early RC clergy in their misguided belief that they are closer to God than the common people. It's all about power.\n\n Actually, the RC clergy is no more inclined to abuse than any other Christian group. I believe there is also evidence that indicates that it is no more inclined to abuse than secular groups such as teachers, etc. See this article (written by a Protestant researcher) concerning pedophilia in the RC clergy:\n \n The Myth of the Pedophile Priest\n http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/religion/re0534.html\n \n As for people resisting the urge of orgasm, it is done by everyone on the planet very often. It is done very often for long periods of time. You are actually probably resisting that urge right now. Spouses who have loved one's injured or sick to the extent that they cannot have sex do it for the remainder of lives in many cases. \n \n Celibacy has little to do with power and much more to do with humility and imitating the life of Jesus.\n \n Also, the cover up by the Church hierarchy that DamEtel mentions should be condemned. The priests involved in crimes of this nature should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, defrocked, and never allowed to work around children again. \n \n But remember a few things to temper your judgment in these cases. There are many emotionally injured and pychologically ill people out there that will harm others' reputations to console their own--sometimes they lash out at clergy. Also, the Church is seen as a cash cow by many while other Christian groups are not. Those groups are not targeted as publicly or litigiously...not to mention a seeming media animosity toward the Church that is interested in bringing it forth to public ridicule at every possible opportunity. \n \n Finally, think about how many sex offenders within the last 2-3 years have been repeat offenders let out of a prison sentence early or not sentenced long enough in the first place. These stories have been ALL OVER the news FREQUENTLY as of late. We know that these people either cannot be rehabilitated, we are not doing it the correct way, or we are not giving it enough time, effort, and attention. So we see that the secular institutions have failed in this as well. This is partly due to the field of pyschology telling us how to treat these people and not realizing the extent or nature of the problem. Pyschologists were involved in handling the priest cases also. So the cover up wasn't always an outright attempt to cover scandal and protect the church. It was sometimes an effort at mercy for the sinning priest, sometimes listening to \"experts\" that thought the priest was rehabilitated, and sometimes simply bad judgment by the bishops.",

What you are doing is not arguing a point but attempting to harm a group of people.

   "I think that the dynamics of adult /child interaction that allow for more opportunities This is why the schools have the same problem, and this is why the boy scouts and girl scouts have taken special precautions to minimize the risk,\n \n The way that a structured heirarchy, (such as the RCC) can protect perps does make that crime more heinious. However, that 'self protection' is not unique to the RCC church. They might have been able to do it on a broader basis than most places, but htat is merely because of the size of the ogranization.\n\n \n You are right. The structured hierarchy also helps to protect teachers and nursing home staff. However, the state licensing requirements for those types of businesses (in the US at least) adds one extra layer of montoring. However, the abuses still happen. I just noted where a teacher was sentenced within the last day or two for this very thing.\n \n I would say that there has been much evil done in the name of God. This saddens me to no end. I believe it also saddens the heart of God as well. \n \n I would also say that much Evil has been done for many other reasons as well. Much good has been done in the name of God and for many other reasons.\n \n Given that, then what is used to determine good and evil? Who gets to say and why?",
