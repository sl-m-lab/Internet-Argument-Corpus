Rush Limbaugh, his man-boobs a-jiggle, bouncing at the CPAC podium to bask in the sickly glow of conservatism&#8217;s orgy of greed, avarice, and arrogance. Here, at last, was the shining image of the 21st century Republican Party: a leeringly rich Baby Boomer squatting at the top of the mountain, reaping his jollies from the suffering of those at the bottom, praying for the failure of hope. If this hypocritical and morally repugnant reformed Oxy junkie wants to discuss &#8220;failure,&#8221; maybe we should talk about his career as an NFL commentator &#8212; or the last time he detoxed off prescription smack.\n\n \n The Raw Story | Rush Limbaugh wins 'unsexiest' man of the year award\n \n What an oink!",

More Obama intelligence?\n\n emoticon_xdonno\n Where the heck do you get this \"He was so sure he could do it and Bush couldn't.\" junk?\n Bush WOULD NOT go after bin Laden cause Bush said, and I quote: \"I truly am not that concerned about him (bin Laden).\"\n \n I'm sorry, but it's hard to do WORSE than not caring about catching bin Laden...\n \n \n \nSo let's see - Obama's vision for America: Kill more innocent unborn babies...\n\n I swear.\n This \"abortion rant\" gets really, really, really old...\n Yeah. We get it. You disagree with Obama on abortion.\n \n At the end of Obama's first four years, do you think any MORE abortions will happen because Obama is president than what happened under Bush's presidency?\n It's not like Bush held back flood-gates to prevent \"innocent unborn babies\" from being killed.\n \n Naw. You can't answer the question truthfully, but in the end what you really want is a president who will agree with you on how awful you think abortion is, even though Bush never really did anything to effectively stop it...\n \n \n \n... run up massive national debt and deficits that would make Bush blush (and we're only 60 days into Obama's socialist reign)...\n\n Economic fire needs to be put out.\n Republicans waste water on the lawn, flowing the excess down the sewer drain.\n Obama has a fire to put out, and all of a sudden they are water conservationists... emoticon_xdonno\n \n \n \n... let more illegal aliens flood across the border...\n\n I seem to remember refuting all this junk already, and then you JUST IGNORED IT.\n Tell you what. I'll just repeat myself when you do nothing more than repeat what I've already refuted... \n \n ROFLMAO!\n Do I really need to remind you that Bush had a Republican dominated congress FOR SIX YEARS???\n And do I need to show you EXACTLY what Bush did during that time???\n \n Here you go...\n Washington Times - Bush revives bid to legalize illegal aliens\n And did the Republicans refuse to go along???\n \n \n \n... crank up new laws restricting American gun ownership at a time when alien criminals and drug gangsters are flooding across the border...\n\n You're attacking him for junk he hasn't even done...\n That's hilarious!\n \n \n \n... pick numerous tax cheats for cabinet positions...\n\n I will give you that he has made some poor picks that he shouldn't have.\n But compare that to \"Meiers\" for SCOTUS or \"Brownie\" for FEMA, and I can't help but think that it's a wash.\n We haven't improved or devolved.\n \n \n \n... put a naive, far-left loon in as Secretary of State; print more money so we can have inflation; raise taxes on corporations so they move off-shore; raise taxes on the rich to stifle investment at a time when we really need it...\n\n You're just rambling at this stage.\n Do you have ANY CLUE as to how many corporations pay NO TAXES WHATSOEVER???\n Most Companies Pay No Federal Income Tax - CBS News\n \n And as for the rich, Obama is just RETURNING THEIR TAX RATE to what it was before Bush and Republicans inappropriately gouged it to a degree that he created a deficit situation.\n RETURNING their tax rate to what they paid in the 90's.\n \n \n \n... propose and enact the illegal seizure of private companies; close Guantanamo so we can bring the terrorists to American and let them loose here to tie up our criminal courts and expose our intelligence capabilities when \"discoveries\" are done ##### around with Iran like a pack of naive school children; \n\n Again, you're attacking him for junk you are SCARED will happen.\n Go hide in your closet. You're boring me.\n \n \n \nchop funds for the F-22 Raptor - the finest fighter in the world, so we can be more vulnerable...\n\n That's the great thing with Republicans.\n A republican hyper-inflates the \"defense\" budget, and then whines like crazy when it gets cut to a more normal stage.\n \n Republicans claimed Clinton devastated the military, but then BUSH WENT TO WAR in Afghanistan with Clinton's military... \n \n \n \n... propose national health care so we can go further into debt, and so the government can tell us which health procedures we can wait 6 months for...\n\n Again, you're scared of what hasn't even happened...\n \n \n \n appear angry about AIG bonuses when your Treasury Secretary and Chris Dodd were the ones who authorized them...\n\n WOAH, WOAH, WOAH There.\n I acknowledge Dodd did something incredibly stupid, but ULTIMATELY the responsibility lies at the feet of AIG ITSELF.\n At best, Dodd left the front door unlocked.\n AIG was the thief who walked in and took what wasn't theirs.\n Dodd never told them to.\n \n \n \n... ignore balancing the budget...\n\n You're repeating yourself.\n Again, it's only when a Democrat is elected that Republicans even think of \"balancing the budget\".\n \n And NOW that we have a Democrat in the White House, NOW Republicans proclaim they want to \"balance the budget\".\n I say you guys should stop shovelling manure.\n \n CLINTON had a balanced budget.\n Reagan? Deficit SKYROCKETED.\n Bush Sr? Deficit UP.\n Bush Jr? Made them all look like amateurs.\n http://i26.photobucket.com/albums/c114/foundit66/120m447.jpg\n \n You think Republicans want to \"balance the budget\"???\n Don't make me puke!\n \n \n \n... and a thousand other really dumb things.\n\n Half of what you complain about is your exaggerated fear.\n Bush INCREASES THE TERRORISM THREAT, and you're scared of what Obama HAS NOT done.\n The other half is your political differences. Calling the other side \"dumb\" because they don't agree with you is pretty lame.\n \n And can I just note, that you are CONSISTENTLY attempting to turn this into an \"Obama\" thread cause you cannot defend Rush or the real reasons Republicans are criticized. emoticon_ic",

   "The Dominican Republic's history is scarred by the legacy of colonial mismanagement, plantation slavery and foreign intervention, a legacy which continues to impede the country's economic growth (see Ferguson, 1992). Over the past two decades, the Dominican Republic has experienced growing debt problems (partly due to the falling price of sugar, the country's main commodity on the world market), unemployment (now estimated at 23%) and high inflation.\n \n .... A UNICEF report on child prostitution in the Dominican Republic published in 1994 concludes that poverty, lack of alternative earning opportunities and the lack of a stable family unit are the factors usually associated with prostitution of young girls (Silvestre et al, 1994). Girl children are denied access to work that boy children often undertake, such as shoeshine, bottle collecting, selling sweets or becoming messengers.\n \n Research with child prostitutes found that 30% of those aged between 12 and 15 years old were illiterate and that girls in particular had not been encouraged to stay on at school.\n \n .... In some areas, up to 60% of the children working as prostitutes had given birth to one or more children by the age of 18, some of whom were fathered by clients. In other words, sexism serves to further restrict the opportunities open to poor girl children.... The incidence of child abuse, incest and rape of girls between the ages of 12 and 15 is very high according to the UNICEF research and it is also the case that girls are often initiated into sexual activities at an early age by someone in their close circle of family or neighbours. The country's poverty, combined with its Catholicism, means that both sex education and access to contraception are very limited, which accounts for the high number of teenage pregnancies. Many girls are sexually exploited by family and 'friends' from the age of 12 onwards, and prostitution becomes a logical extension of this when they need to financially support themselves.*\n\n http://www.childtrafficking.com/Docs/o_connell_1996__child_prost3.pdf\n \n Limbaugh may have a sexual preference for children, but I think his taste may run more to little boys.\n \n We may be very sure that Limbaugh isn't traveling to the Dominican Republic to do good works.

   "Are you kidding me? Just because someone goes to the Dom Rep., they are a child molester? He couldn't have been going for cigars and perhaps to meet a lady friend from here? I'm fairly certain that with his enemies in the govt. there are plenty of people watching his actions and if he starts buggering kids, you'll see pictures of it. \n \n I disagree with plenty of people on the left but I don't assume they are molesters just because they don't think like I do. And I really disagree with religion but I don't assume every Christian (or EVEN priest) is either.\n \n Debating someone's ideas is one thing but calling them a molester because they visit a particular country is insane.\n\n \n Exactly (except for the \"enemies in the government\" part)",

   "Rush Limbaugh is not fond of women. \n \n Failed marriages. Ex-wives paid to keep their mouths shut. Sort of like Rock Hudson's bride of many years ago.\n \n His little sordid adventure in Pittsburgh many years ago.\n \n The language he uses regarding women.\n \n Definitely does not like women.\n\n \n What I can't stand about Limbaugh is he failure to make a point properly. All he does is say \"so and so said this, blah blah\" therefore it must be false \"since he/she's a hippie!\" instead of looking at what they said and attacking it.",
