   "Discussion on the Mary Travers thread got me thinking about harmonica performances (I was reminded of one with John Sebastian). Anyway, I love a good harmonica, and there are so many, so I thought I'd start a thread for sharing harmonica players people have enjoyed. \n \n YouTube - \"This Train Is Bound For Glory\" By Terry Mcmillian (FULL)\n \n Harmonica is a big part of a diverse range of American music. If people have clips of harmonica players from other countries, too, that would be cool.\n \n And, can't talk about harmonica, or American harmonica, without listening to Sonny Boy Williamson II. \n \n YouTube - BYE BYE BIRD, Sonny Boy Williamson II",
