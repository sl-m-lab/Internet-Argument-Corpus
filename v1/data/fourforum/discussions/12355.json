   "Stimulus Bill Broke 7 Obama Promises | Sweetness & Light\n \n Are we getting a clear picture of the real Barack Obama?\n \n ***********************************************************\n \n 7 Broken Promises in Record Time\n \n 1. Make government open and transparent.\n \n 2. Make it \"impossible\" for Congressmen to slip in pork barrel projects.\n \n 3. Meetings where laws are written will be more open to the public. (Even Congressional Republicans shut out.)\n \n 4. No more secrecy.\n \n 5. Public will have 5 days to look at a bill.\n \n 6. You'll know what's in it.\n \n 7. We will put every pork barrel project online.\n \n Funny, but not one of Mr. Obama's promises were met with the most expensive spending bill in our nation's history.\n \n GOP Frozen Out Of Stimulus Conference | Sweetness & Light\n DEMOCRATS' MIDNIGHT \"STIMULUS\" POWER PLAY\n \n February 11th, 2009\n \n So this is \"transparency\" under the Democratic regime. . .\n \n It appears that Speaker Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Reid's staff met all through the night in secret with Democratic conferees' staff to cobble together the \"stimulus\" conference report. Republican conferees were frozen out.\n \n The objective appears to be to produce a final conference report on the trillion-dollar spending bill by this afternoon so that floor action can take place in both chambers by Thursday.\n \n They intend to ram this trillion-dollar spending bill through with as little debate and scrutiny as possible.\n \n The House voted unanimously yesterday in support of a Republican measure stating that the American people should have 48 hours to review the bill prior to passage. Will Democrats follow through? Or will they do the opposite of what they voted to do yesterday?\n \n Yes, this is Mr. Obama's post-partisan politics.\n \n This is the open and honest leadership the Democrats have been promising us.",

   "FDR in 1944 had it right in his SoU speech:\n \n In our day these economic truths have become accepted as self-evident. We have accepted, so to speak, a second Bill of Rights under which a new basis of security and prosperity can be established for all-regardless of station, race, or creed.\n \n Among these are:\n \n The right to a useful and remunerative job in the industries or shops or farms or mines of the nation;\n \n The right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation;\n \n The right of every farmer to raise and sell his products at a return which will give him and his family a decent living;\n \n The right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopolies at home or abroad;\n \n The right of every family to a decent home;\n \n The right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health;\n \n The right to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment;\n \n The right to a good education.\n \n All of these rights spell security. And after this war is won we must be prepared to move forward, in the implementation of these rights, to new goals of human happiness and well-being.\n \n America's own rightful place in the world depends in large part upon how fully these and similar rights have been carried into practice for our citizens.\n \n It's 2009 and we are not there yet.",

And the evidence of that is that no country has ever successfully spent their way out of a recession. It goes against all of the rules of economics. \n \n Just think, we committed the first near trillion dollars under Bush in order to ward off this economic mortgage and banking collapse just a few months ago That also had plenty in it dedicated to the failing auto industry. And in Obama's first month in office, the dems get amnesia and insist on this second trillion to accomplish the same thing. But strangely enough, most of this money is going toward an agenda to entrench liberal and democratic party policies and institutions rather than improve the economy at all. \n \n What you are either too ignorant to grasp, or too brain washed to care about is that when you add up the overall long term cost which his plan represents, if we collected every dollar from every single national economy on Earth for a full year it wouldn't match the debt that we owe.

   "I've lived, gone to school, and worked in \"socialist\" Europe. You don't want to go there. They have slow economic growth, high unemployment, stagnation, and can only compete on the world stage with government subsidies like Airbus. Their students want to come to the US to go to school. They're fighting with the unions to roll back all the entitlements and there are strikes and riots. Efficiency? 15 trips to City Hall to get my resident card for my job. Three years ago they were still using typewriters. Taxes? Two people going for burgers at a Fridays (American chain restaurant) was $75 3 years ago.\n \n As for socialized medicine....On a personal level we really liked our doctor but did you see the movie Schindler's List where the naked women are running in a circle getting chosen for the gas chambers? That's what it feels like to go to a doctor. They don't have to give you a sheet to cover up with when you take your clothes off because they don't think of making you comfortable. It's a different mindset, i.e. not competitive. In England it wasn't cost effective to have doctors in small towns so some people had to drive quite far to go to a doctor. They wouldn't pay for expensive treatments for terminal diseases to keep you alive for what they viewed as short periods of time. The BBC was one of the only English channels we got and there was always a horror story about their medical system on the news. \n \n Did you listen to Obama's speech about cap and trade. His approach is to make \"polluting\" energy (which is carbon energy) more expensive than clean energy. But since most of our energy is carbon and clean is expensive or nonexistent, he'll be raising prices for consumers and businesses during a recession. Does that sound like a good idea? What if you're unemployed and struggling and now your energy bills go up? What if you're a business and your higher energy bills make the difference between laying off workers or keeping them?\n \n As for Obama's education agenda...what countries are more competitive than the United States? Didn't you see foreign students in your classes? Were they complaining about the poor quality of our universities? Do you see American students rushing for the exits other than those that leave because they want to learn a foreign language? How many Nobel prizes does our country have? What countries are more advanced in science, medicine, and technology than our own? If you have to have a complicated and dangerous medical operation would you stay in this country or have it elsewhere if money were no object? So spending on education is going to help the economy in a recession? And there's no need to worry about a multitrillion dollar budget?\n \n If you listened carefully to Obama's speech last night, he talked about the jobs his \"stimulus\" bill has created. Police, teachers, and infrastructure construction...all union, dependent on govt spending, and campaign payback. Not the kind of jobs that would have been created if companies had been encouraged to invest their own money in their businesses. Not the kind that sustain themselves and grow into more jobs as new products and markets develop. Very sad.\n \n My point. I guess some Obama supporters will read this and say...Bush ruined the country for eight years. Hopefully, some will read it and think about more than that.",
