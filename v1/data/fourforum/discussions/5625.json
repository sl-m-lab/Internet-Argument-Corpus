It can be done through any number of ways like conditioning, repetition, problem solving, reading, listening, feeling etc, etc.\n \n Furthermore I have to ask at what age children are considered legal individuals in america. In Sweden, children are not conbsidered legal individuals until the age of 15 and by which time they have basicly finished the mandatory school. In Sweden, it is therfor not children that are forced to school, but rather the parents that are forced to send their children to school. And this does not relate to your idea of learning at all (since parents can certainly force their children who don`t want to learn to attend school, with or without legal backing, and parents can withold shcooling for children who wants to learn).",
