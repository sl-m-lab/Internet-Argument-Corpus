   "I disagree...many say our presence in Vietnam has actually influenced them into more of a democracy (in a long run look). Will Iraq fail? Maybe. It is worth a try in order to have a somewhat stable country in the middle East? That too is up for opinion, I honestly don't know but hind-site is always 20/20 so maybe in 20 years we will know if it was good idea or not.\n\n \n I'm far too selfish to continue spending our treasure and blood on what I consider imposing our ideology on a nation who did us no harm after destroying their country, and using our military force to attempt that change. I'd rather have that money stay in the US and avoid the deaths. \n \n As to Iraq's stability, I think only a dreamer, politician or self-interested party could state Iraq is headed to stability under our tutelage. They're just getting started and already the defense minister resigned with billions of missing dollars. Wait until they really learn our political system.",

   "Rebuilding a nation one has invaded and occupied for no good reason that's still resisting our presence reeks of egotism and self-serving interest. Why not get out now and let the three main Iraqi powers sort themselves out? Turkey and Iran are the big boys who will influence the future of Iraq without US occupation. That's what's eventually going to happen no matter how long we remain occupiers hiding in the shadows.\n\n \n This is the same problem we ran into with Kosovo, Somolia, and pretty much everywhere else we have tried to force peace under crushing military presence.\n \n Forcing people to stop fighting does not solve anything. Removing a tyrant is likwise useless if it is done by an outside force. It has never really worked in the past and frankly I am not seeing any indicators that show it to be working now. It just draws the violence out, sucks more people in, and in the end you spin your wheels for years and nothing gets solved.",
