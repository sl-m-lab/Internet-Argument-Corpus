   "Fort Worth Prosecuting Victims of Rainbow Lounge Gay Bar Raid - Towleroad, More than gay news. More gay men\n \n \n \n Two victims of the Rainbow Lounge raid last June in Fort Worth, Texas who were injured in the raid, are being prosecuted by the city:\n \n \"Chad Gibson suffered a severe brain injury while in police custody that kept him hospitalized for a week. Officers said he fell and hit his head while handcuffed. He said he was injured when officers slammed him against a wall inside the bar. Gibson is being charged with 'public intoxication' and 'assaulting a state agent.' George Armstrong suffered severe bruising and muscle strain while being arrested. He is charged with 'public intoxication.' Adam Seidel, the attorney for both men, said his clients are not willing to accept a plea bargain and asked that a date be set for the trial.\"\n \n Hasn't Fort Worth's image been damaged enough by this raid? Now they're prosecuting the victims? Despicable.",

   "\"Victims of the raid\", thats funny. What your article fails to mention is that this wasn't a raid, it was an inspection, one the owner new of in advance. You don't notify the owner in advance of a \"raid\". TABC did two inspections that night, there were 9 arrests at the first one and 7 at this one. Also, these two bozo's are not \"victims\" they were arrested for public intoxication along with 14 other people that evening. As far as I know the others pled guilty and paid the fine.\n Maybe you should find a more accurate source for your information JJ. Just out of curiosity have you even read the TABC statement concerning the inspections?",

   "Sec. 49.02. PUBLIC INTOXICATION. (a) A person commits an offense if the person appears in a public place while intoxicated to the degree that the person may endanger the person or another.\n \n (a-1) For the purposes of this section, a premises licensed or permitted under the Alcoholic Beverage Code is a public place.\n \n (b) It is a defense to prosecution under this section that the alcohol or other substance was administered for therapeutic purposes and as a part of the person's professional medical treatment by a licensed physician.\n \n (c) Except as provided by Subsection (e), an offense under this section is a Class C misdemeanor.\n \n (d) An offense under this section is not a lesser included offense under Section 49.04.\n \n (e) An offense under this section committed by a person younger than 21 years of age is punishable in the same manner as if the minor committed an offense to which Section 106.071, Alcoholic Beverage Code, applies.\n\n \n Jito, above is the appropriate section from the Texas penal code. Many areas have similar ordinances, it gives the police an avenue to control intoxicated people if they become beligerant, start playing in traffic, hassle people, etc. As you can see its a class c misdemeaner, nothing really. Heck, useing someone elses dumpster is a class b. \n \n This whole thing looks like activist grand standing more than anything else.",

   "On both sides likely. I generally believe that the truth lies in the middle. \n\n \n Between activist I would agree, the truth is usually somewhere in the middle. But in this case the activism seems to be one sided. I tend to lean towards believing the police report over arrested drunk people. Not that police can't be wrong or abusive, It just doesn't seem to fit this case, there were 9 law enforcment officers on site from 2 different agencies and a bar full of patrons, seems like a pretty stupid place to start playing fast and loose with the rules.\n \n \nDo I think it was an actual raid? - No.\n\n \n Agree.\n \n \nDo I think these fellas deserved to be arrested? Possibly.\n\n \n Also, agree.\n \n \nDo I think its possible that juiced up red-neck cops took advantage of the opportunity to hassle some gay men? - You bet.\n\n \n While I'd agree that this does happen, I don't think it did here. They inspected two other bars (I was mistaken earlier when I said one other) and arrested a total of 14 people. If they were out to \"hassle gay men\" why go to the other two bars? Why notify the owner that they were coming? Why only charge them with something so piddly? If they wanted to hassle them they could have easily charged them with something more serious ie. resisting arrest or assaulting a police officer.\n \n \nThere are some good cops out there. And there are plenty who are power hungry thugs who misuse their weapons and authority. \n\n \n Agreed, but, I would quantify it to say the former greatly outnumber the latter.\n \n Btw, I love your quote from Mae West.",

You will have to forgive me. I have dealt with the ugly side of police lately. Quiet, shy 16 year old kid accross the street from me was severly beaten by two Mpls cops while in handcuffs.
