How would it differ, if at all, from the science we employ today?\n\n creation being accepted as true would imply that an intelligent and very powerful god exists and at least genesis is closer to fact than fiction. \n \n the problem is that it opens up an avenue of phenomena that follows no scientific or logical procedure. transforming clay into a living carbon-based fully functional human being is neither scientific nor logical. yet if with god it is possible, then that aspect of principle-based science and logic gets completely tossed out of the window. a god that can move millions of tons earth and rock across thousands of miles to create supercontinents and mountainous terrain in a single day goes against all the principles of geology and geography as we know it. a god that can cause living land creatures to spontanously spawn out of the ground, and living fish and sea creatures out of a vast but empty sea goes against everything we know about biology and chemistry. a god that can cause the sun and stars to exist after the planet earth had already been existing \"since the beginning\" goes against everything our studies of cosmology has taught us.\n \n science dictates that a specific input through a specific process produces a specific outcome. as long as the input variables are known, and the process works reliably, the outcome is totally predictable. this simple premise is what science is based on completely. a marble will roll down a slope till it reaches the bottom. put the marble back up the slope 1 zillion times, and it will roll to the bottom in the same manner 1 zillion times. with the existence of a world-creating god, the possibility exists that the marble may roll up the slope, across the slope, or simply not roll at all. there are no predictable or reliable principles that can be applied to such a god. basically, things occur by his whim, and science is useless",
