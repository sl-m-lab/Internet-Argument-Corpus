   "n the spring of 1993, shortly after her husband and political benefactor Bill Clinton took office as the nation's 42nd president, Hillary Clinton delivered the commencement address at the University of Texas. In her speech, Hillary reiterated the theme that has been at the heart of her political vision from the start:\n \n \"We are at a stage in history in which remolding society is one of the great challenges facing all of us in the West.\"\n \n \"Remolding society.\" This is the terminology of a utopian socialist, one who seeks to remake society according to a narrow and dogmatic ideology that claims to eliminate injustice, poverty, and unhappiness, once and for all. Hillary's ideology is an amalgam of New Left marxism and grievance feminism, the kind of unwholesome stew that is commonplace on elite college campuses.\n \n Significantly, the term \"remolding\" - unlike such terms as \"reform\" or \"renew\" - reflects a sweeping rejection of society as it currently exists: family structure (too patriarchal), economic organization (favors the rich), social practices (discriminate against women and minorities), and so on. In other words, someone who believes that society needs to be \"remolded\" is someone who, at bottom, cannot see any good in the American way of life - and someone who, if she could, would radically change that way of life. Who doubts that this describes Hillary Clinton?\n \n Lest anyone think that a more mature and experienced Hillary Clinton has tempered her political objective, consider her recent speech in Concord, N.H., at an event over Labor Day weekend that her campaign titled \"Change We Need.\" In her speech, Hillary forthrightly declared: \"I will bring my experience to the White House and begin to change our country starting on Day One.\" That's right: Change our country. As her official campaign Web site illustrates, Hillary means what she says.\n\n \n Link to Story\n Damn Socialist XXX emoticon_xclown s",

Well think about it have we not seen remoliding of society in the last few years with regard to family structure, economic organization, and social practices? Did not the Republicans run on the platform of remolding society in THEIR image? Tax cuts for the rich, attacks on the middle class, ignoring scientific resarch in favor of conservative values, turing off stem cell research, ignoring global warming data, switch back to favoring big iron industries like oil instead of continuing to catalyze high tech energy solutions, and of course last and not least starting foreign imperial wars pre-emptetively.
