   "Galileo. You act like this is the NRA's fault. And that we gun owners would sell out the rest of the Constitution if we could keep our 2nd Amendment. However, and what you probably didn't count on. We, in very large numbers condemned this political tactic by the Democrats, to take an end run on our Constitution. Don't believe me? Here are a small number of the articles written condemning this tactic. \n \n  NRA deal on campaign finance throws smaller groups under the bus \n \"House Democrats have offered to exempt the National Rifle Association from a sweeping campaign-finance bill, removing a major obstacle in the push to roll back the Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling,\" a Politico report informs us. \n \n What masterful weasel-wording. We won't actively participate in the mugging, but we'll stand by with our hands in our pockets and watch--and then share in the plunder.\n \n his is no different than Fudd gun owners throwing Evil Black Rifle owners under the bus as long as they get to keep their \"sporting\" arms. It's the conduct of self-serving collaborators, not of champions. \n\n And here are more articles, written by us, condemning this lack of prudent stewardship of our Constitutional principles!\n  Yet Again the NRA Sells Out Freedom to the Democrats \n \n  Republicans, liberal groups oppose proposed campaign-finance exemption for NRA \n \n  RA Cuts Questionable Deal with Democrats \n \n  NRA & Shuler torpedo gun rights organizations \n \n  Political Wisdom: Did the NRA Sell Out? \n \n  NRA Cuts Deal with House Democrats \n \n  National Rifle Association's First Amendment Sellout \n \n  They can pry the NRA's donor list from its cold, dead hands \n \n  Guns and Free Speech -- The NRA sells out to Democrats on the First Amendment \n \n \n  Conservatives take on the NRA over deal on disclosure bill \n Conservative groups are waging an 11th-hour campaign against the DISCLOSE Act, a bill written to amend campaign-finance law in the wake of the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision.\n \n The bill makes the changes that Democrats want, and for that reason it was moribund for weeks. But conservatives blame the National Rifle Association for cutting a deal and crafting language that exempts it from the bill's disclosure requirements.\n \n The most visible critic of the deal is Myron Ebell, director of Freedom Action and a fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, who is encouraging conservatives to slam Congress with calls and e-mails. He is pointedly attacking the NRA for the carve-out.\n \n ....\n The Family Research Council is also hitting the NRA -- one of several pro-life groups accusing the pro-Second Amendment group of selling out. \"In an unfortunate move,\" said FRC vice president of government affairs Tom McCluskey in a statement, \"the NRA decided self-preservation trumped principle and is accepting this affront on the First Amendment as long as they are protected.\"\n\n However we soon learned that the NRA had no negotiations with the Democrats what so ever. They were just informed that the Democrats were just exempting them.\n \n When the bill was floundering, the Democrats tried some last minute tricks to sneak it past the Constitution! \n   CCRKBA's Gottlieb to Democrats on revised Disclose Act exemption: 'Pound sand' \n Before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi pulled the so-called \"Disclose Act\" (H.R. 5175) for consideration, putting off any action until sometime next week, House Democrats trying to salvage what had become a debacle made an amended offer that one gun rights leader quickly refused.\n \n As noted in an update of yesterday's installment here, the bill was floundering......\n \n Late Thursday, in an effort to mollify smaller gun rights and other groups, the exemption threshold was lowered to include organizations with 500,000 members. \n \n Advised of the change, an audibly disgusted Gottlieb reacted via telephone: \"Even though we may now be exempted, we still oppose the bill.\" Desperate Democrats can, in his opinion, \"pound sand.\" Lowering the bar to quell the firestorm, he indicated, was simply insult added to injury.\n\n \n Your anger is just, but misdirected. Look a little closer to home! emoticon_smile",
