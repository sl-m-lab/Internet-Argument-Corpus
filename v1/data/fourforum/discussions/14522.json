   "The following was posted by a gay man on another board I belong to in the wake of the Federal ruling that prop 8 was unconstitutional.It was from the bottom of his heart and wholly unrehearsed and I think one of the most moving things that I have ever read. I'd like to share it;\n \n David A posted;\n \"I saw some incredible things this evening. I heard some speeches, saw lots of hugging, laughing and basic party your butt off. The thing that struck me was that most of the crowd was young. I realized they had no clue how long this had taken and what roads had been traveled to get to this day. They seemed to be under the delusion that this was a new phenomena that had only been in existence for a few years. I had the opportunity to give a little history lesson to a few of these youngsters as we were setting up for the festivities. I was amazed they had such little understanding or knowledge of where we started from or how this came to be.\n \n One of the three had never even heard of Stonewall Union, the other two had. They just couldn't tell me what it was about or what actually happened there. They knew it had something to do with the police, but that was about it. I was dumbfounded. You really need to learn your history. Us old foggies are going to be gone in the not too distant future and someone needs to tell the story. \n \n I told them that I lived through a time when being gay meant you had a mental illness.\n \n I lived through a time when common wisdom said if you were gay you were a pedophile.\n \n I lived through a time when it was unheard of for a gay man or lesbian woman to have a child. Should they actually have a child, the court would step in and remove the child from their home. We were seen as unfit parents and our children would grow up to be gay. \n \n I lived through a time when police officers would raid gay bars and arrest and beat gay men and lesbian women. All for sport. \n \n I lived through a time when leaving a gay establishment meant the police could be waiting to pull you over. They'd break your tail light or head light and then issue you a ticket for that broken light all the while snickering at you and calling you the most vile of names. \n \n I remember those incredibly strong and wonderful drag queens who finally started the gay rights movement by screaming \"ENOUGH\", \"We're not going to take this anymore\" and they literally fought back with the police that had come to beat them yet again. The police were shocked and actually retreated. The police never did go back to Stonewall Union. On that day we learned, we didn't have to be passive and put up with the beatings, the arrests. We did NOT have to be ashamed. All over the country gay men and lesbian women began to fight back. I do find it a bit humorous that it took drag queens to get us to fight back and make us begin to feel proud. For some of us it was the first time in our lives we began to see ourselves differently. We began to want and expect more for not only ourselves but our families. \n \n I told them that I had lived through a time when you could be arrested and jailed for sodomy. But only if you were gay. It was okay for straights, just not gays. The police would break down your door, wake you out of your sleep and arrest you. \n \n I lived through a time when you could not rent or buy a home because you were a gay man or lesbian woman. If you did move into a neighborhood and you were found out, you were forced to move. Either by intimidation, vandalism, or beatings. If that didn't work, they simply burnt your house down. Sometimes you were simply murdered. All in the name of God. God hates Fags dontcha know.\n \n I lived through a time when you could be fired (still can in some states) simply for being gay.\n \n I lived through a time when if you dare stand up and try to march to get your rights, you had rocks, bricks and garbage thrown at you.\n \n I lived through a time when the police didn't care if you had rocks and garbage thrown at you. And if you dared to fight back, you were the one arrested.\n \n I lived through a time when so many of our friends wasted away and died from a horrible disease and the govt mantra was \"It's killing all the right people\"\n \n I was shocked to find out these young folk didn't even know about the AIDS quilt. Have they been living under a rock? Has it been that long since AIDS became mainstream?\n \n I lived through a time when because of AIDS, if you dare tell anyone you were gay, you were immediately fired. Contagion and all. Insurance companies dropped you or refused to insure you. You couldn't find a dentist to treat you if they knew you were gay. In a lot of cases, you lost your family who had literally become terrified of you. People were afraid to touch you and would literally cross the street to get away from you. You didn't have to have AIDS, you simply had to be gay. People you had always considered friends, deserted you, refused to even speak to you. The really sad part? In the very beginning, some of this pain was visited upon us by our own community. \n \n It was hard to find a doctor who would even treat you for a head cold, much less that horrible disease. I remember watching people being treated worse then rats when they would show up at hospitals for medical treatment and usually to die. I remember the face masks, the gloves, the rooms that were quarantined. I remember how you could hardly get a nurse to come into the room, much less a doctor.\n \n I lived through a time when it was common to see two or three of your friends die within the same week. Memorials you didn't get to go to because you had already moved on to the next friend who was about to die and needed support. \n \n I lived through a time when it was difficult to find a funeral home or a cemetery that would take a person who had died of AIDS.\n \n I told them that I (and many others) had lived through all of that and survived. I believe living through all of that made us stronger and more compassionate than we would have been otherwise. \n \n I told them I was proud to have done my part to make things better for them and the generations to come. \n \n I also gave them what I hope is advice they won't forget. You must stay ever vigilant against the do-gooders.\n \n I told them about a conversation I had with a do-gooder the other day. This do-gooder was honestly trying to be supportive and offer what they saw as a solution. The do-gooder said that if we behaved better and didn't cause a fuss, that maybe we might get some rights. We just needed to behave and calm down. Stop all the yelling. I told these guys to NEVER accept or buy into that thinking. Some people will always try and find a way to blame you. The do-gooders won't even realize how wrong they are. Now some of those do-gooders do know exactly what they're doing, but we have other names for them.\n \n The do-gooders will tell you that if you meet their expectations and/or requirements, be good little gay boys, they just might give you a little something for you and your family. NEVER let anyone get away with putting this on you. It is not YOUR fault there is discrimination and it's certainly not your fault you have been discriminated against. \n \n Your rights have nothing to do with your behavior. They have nothing to do with whether you are making a fuss or not. Your rights have everything to do with equality. Nothing else. NEVER let anyone tell you differently. \n \n I also told them to never settle. Marriage or nothing. Separate but equal is not equal. I told them that well meaning folks (the do gooders) actually believe separate can be equal. Separate can never be equal. That's why it's called separate. \n \n I'm not sure these young guys believed the history I told them. By looking at their faces I could see they were doubtful but wouldn't dare call the old fart a liar. \n \n These wonderful young folk thought the whole movement started and was about nothing other than gay marriage. Can you imagine? Bless their hearts. \n \n I can see how that story would seem pretty incredible to someone so young. It's not like there are gay history books or teachers teaching gay history. These guys had no idea what it was like back in the day. They had never experienced most of that. Believe it or not, that sort of made me proud. My generation did such a good job, these young folks had no clue, and had never experienced those things. I still wanted to slap them for not knowing their history. \n \n I explained that there was a lot of history long before gay marriage ever came to the forefront. The first fight was just being able to be. To survive. \n \n Seeing your rights put on the ballot and taken away, was a very small, piece of that history. A horrible, painful piece of history that I believe future generations will look back on with wonderment and shame. \n \n But today. Today. A FEDERAL judge said, you can't do this to these people anymore. It's wrong. I can't even imagine. Look how far we've come from \"It's killing all the right people\". \n \n A federal judge said we exist and are equal. We have been acknowledged. For the first time in the history of this country, a Federal judge said I matter. My heart is full. \n \n This is an absolutely incredible unbelievable day. Look how far we've come. Just look. Please God, let me live to see it finished. \n \n When I look back I can't help but wonder, how did all of this happen in just one life time.\"",
