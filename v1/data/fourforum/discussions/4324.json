Radiocarbon dating has some known limitations. Any measurement that exceeds these limitations will probably be invalid. In particular, radiocarbon dating works to find ages as old as 50,000 years but not much older. Using it to date older items will give bad results. Samples can be contaminated with younger or older carbon, again invalidating the results. Because of excess 12C released into the atmosphere from the Industrial Revolution and excess 14C produced by atmospheric nuclear testing during the 1950s, materials less than 150 years old cannot be dated with radiocarbon (Faure 1998, 294).\n \n In their claims of errors, creationists do not consider misuse of the technique. It is not uncommon for them to misuse radiocarbon dating by attempting to date samples that are millions of years old (for example, Triassic \"wood\") or that have been treated with organic substances. In such cases, the errors belong to the creationists, not the carbon-14 dating method. \n\n \n Classic creationist nonsense easily refuted. \n \n http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CD/CD011.html",

   "To Heavenbound: \n \n I think this passage would be helpful for you, please read it with an open mind. \n \n \nI would now like to turn to a third value that science has. It is a little less direct, but not much. The scientist has a lot of experience with ignorance and doubt and uncertainty, and this experience is of very great importance, I think. When a scientist doesn't know the answer to a problem, he is ignorant. When he has a hunch as to what the result is, he is uncertain. And when he is pretty darn sure of what the result is going to be, he is still in some doubt. We have found it of paramount importance that in order to progress we must recognize our ignorance and leave room for doubt. Scientific knowledge is a body of statements of varying degrees of certainty - some most unsure, some mearly sure, but none absolutely certain.\n Now, we scientists are used to this, and we take it for granted that it is perfectly consistent to be unsure, that it is possible to live and not know. But I don't know whether everyone realizes this is true. Our freedom to doubt was born out of a struggle against authority in the early days of science. It was a very deep and strong struggle: permit us to question - to doubt - to not be sure. I think that it is important that we do not forget this struggle and thus perhaps lose what we have gained. Herein lies a responsibility to society.\n \n skip\n \n What, then, is the meaning of it all? What can we say to dispel the mystery of existence?\n \n If we take everything into account - not only what the ancients knew, but all of what we know today that they didn't know - then I think we must frankly admit that we do not know.\n \n But, in admitting this, we have probably found the open channel.\n \n This is not a new idea; this is the idea of the age of reason. This is the philosophy that guided the men who made the democracy that we live under. The idea that no one really knew how to run a government led to the idea that we should arrange a system by which new ideas could be developed, tried out, and tossed out if necessary, with more new ideas brought in - a trial-and-error system. This method was a result of the fact that science was already showing itself to be a successful venture at the end of the eighteenth century. Even then it was clear to socially minded people that the openness of possibilies was an opportunity, and that doubt and discussion were essential to progress into the unknown. If we want to solve a problem that we have never solved before, we must learn the door to the unknown jar.\n We are at the very beginning of time for the human race. It is not unreasonable that we grapple with problems. But there are tens of thousands of years in the future. Our responsibility is to do what we can, learn what we can, improve the solutions, and pass them on. It is our responsibility to leave the people of the future a free hand. In the impetuous youth of humanity, we can make grave errors that can stunt our growth for a long time. This we will do if we say we have the answers now, so young and ignorant as we are. If we suppress all discussion, all criticism, proclaiming \"This is the answer, my friends; man is saved!\" we will doom humanity for a long time to the chains of authority, confined to the limits of our present imagination. It has been done so many times before.\n \n It is our responsibility as scientists, knowing the great progress which comes from a satisfactory philosophy of ignorance, the great progress which is the fruit of freedom of thought, to proclaim the value of this freedom; to teach how doubt is not to be feared but welcomed and discussed; and to demand this freedom as our duty to all coming generations\n\n \n \n Richard P. Feynman, \"WHAT DO YOU CARE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK?\" Further Adventures of a Curious Character, Bantam Books, 1988\n \n In light of this passage, I think your question to duomaxwell is inappropriate; a scientist can be extremely certain of a theory for which there is an overwhelming body of supporting evidence yet remain open to consideration of additional evidence.\n \n \"Betting one's life on something\" is more characteristic of religion, and does not belong in science.",

   "...I think the question quite appropiate [sic] since he believes carbon dating will always give accurate readings.\n\n Actually, done correctly, carbon dating does give accurate dates within the known margins of error (error bars). We are quite certain of the half-life of C-14. That measurement has been done so many times that the statement of scientific doubt is nothing more than a nod to a philosophical principle. College students studying nuclear physics make such measurements as part of routine lab work, and they do so for a number of radioactive elements. Part of that work is to learn the techniques to reliably determine the proportion of a radioactive element in a given sample and to try and change the half-life by any means. One of my sons did such work while earning his undergraduate degree.\n \n So the principles of radiometric dating are well established and well understood and through experimentation and testing they have found to be quite reliable when done properly. Radiocarbon dating has been calibrated for variations in the amount of C-14 in the air. It was first done through dendrochronology (a process of counting tree rings to determine calendar age and then dating such samples to determine radiocarbon age) to calibrate the scale back to about 11,000 years. Beyond that age the error bars were increasingly large with greater ages because of the assumption that the ratio of C-14 varied in the past as it did in the known 11,000 year range.\n \n Other methods were also used to calibrate radiocarbon dating. For example, C-14 proportions were measured in trapped atmospheric gases in ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica. In 1997, varves in cores from the bottom of a lake in Japan (Lake Suigetsu) were counted and radiocarbon dated. This yielded a calibration scale for radiocarbon dating back to 45000 years, essentially the entire useful age for radiocarbon dating. The first 11,000 years of this calibration was virtually identical to the dendrochronology scale.\n \n The claims about uncertainties and unfounded assumptions come from creationist sources. They have a vested interest in a 6,000 year old earth and thus must reject or distort any method of science that shows a greater age. For example, creationists are perfectly happy to use radiocarbon dating to establish the age of the Dead Sea Scrolls or some archaeological site in Palestine, because these dates support their expectations. But when dates older than 4,500 years come up, they merely make the claim, without any evidence that it is possible, that all radiometric dates older that that are really between 4,500 and 6,000 years and that the radio decay of all radioactive elements were affected by \"the flood.\" Pure nonsense since no natural mechanism is known that could cause such an effect and the creationists are unable to offer any mechanism that would give their claims legitimacy.\n \n There is also the creationist tendency to misreport real science or to simply lie. Examples of the above are the creationist claim that lava of a known age (800 years) was dated to some great age (several great ages, in fact). They even cite the reference to a real scientific paper that was published in real scientific literature. This is one way that creationists give the appearance of doing real \"creation science\" to their ignorant dupes. When one looks at the paper in question it isn't even necessary to read the paper to see what is essentially creationist dishonesty or creationist stupidity. The title of the paper specifically mentions \"mafic inclusions.\" Now the scientifically illiterate creationist dupes don't usually bother to learn what is meant by mafic inclusion. A mafic inclusion would be a dark colored rock that is carried along in the lava - that is, it is NOT melted lava and is thus a rock with an age older than the lava. The purpose of the paper was to show that in dating lava great care must exercised to make sure that the sample does not contain inclusions.\n \n Another creationist claim of error is that material from a living clam had been radiocarbon dated to millions of years. Any fool that has bothered to inform themselves of the facts of radiocarbon dating knows two things. Radiocarbon cannot be used to yield dates in the millions of years, and radiocarbon cannot be used to date animals that get their carbon from sources of old carbon, like the limestone deposits in the sea from which clams are likely to get their carbon. Again, such claims by \"creation scientists\" are either dishonest or stupid, but their purpose is to make \"creation science\" sound scientific.\n \n And then there is the \"creation science\" claim that a circuit board from a TV set had been radiocarbon dated to millions of years. Again, stupid for two reasons. First, the millions of years thing, and second, only material from an organism that has lived in the last 50,000 years or so and derived its carbon from the air can be radiocarbon dated.\n \n There have been several cases of claims by \"creation scientists\" of spurious radiometric dates that have been shown to be sloppy field work by the creationists. In other words, they contaminated their own samples. One notable example was contamination with pollen, the bane of real scientists in radiocarbon dating because pollen is pervasive.\n \n So most usually claims about errors in radiometric dating are from creationists who, because of their scientific illiteracy, have allowed themselves to be duped by dishonest or stupid \"creation scientists.\"\n \nWe normally don't bet on our lives as christians either.\n\n Aside from the fact that I have often seen christians claim that they do that very thing based on their belief in mythology, the idea is actually quite comical.
