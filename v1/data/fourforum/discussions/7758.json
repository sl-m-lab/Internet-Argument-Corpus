Why is it anything that is gay has \"an agenda.\" Maybe this is for children who have gay parents or have friends with gay parents and that story exists in life experience as much as any other story exists. It harms no one to tell them about this aspect of human existence. (I actually have never seen the books, however, so I am not able to give a truly valid estimation of their content. I only speak anout the issue in general) Many other books talk about relationships, and mommies and daddies, and special friends and this is not an agenda. No one considers this being in your face. Heterosexuality is (of course) pervasive. I don't think it is unfair to have the rare book that addresses gay issues, because it is another part of life. It is not vile or despicable or any harm to young minds, and it is nuts for legislators to waste taxpayers money even talking about the issue, let alone endorsing censorship.

Grow up.\n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n Protecting Marriage\n We strongly support President Bush's call for a Constitutional amendment that\n fully protects marriage, and we believe that neither federal nor state judges nor\n bureaucrats should force states to recognize other living arrangements as equivalent to\n marriage. We believe, and the social science confirms, that the well-being of children is\n best accomplished in the environment of the home, nurtured by their mother and father\n anchored by the bonds of marriage. We further believe that legal recognition and the\n accompanying benefits afforded couples should be preserved for that unique and special\n union of one man and one woman which has historically been called marriage.\n After more than two centuries of American jurisprudence, and millennia of human\n experience, a few judges and local authorities are presuming to change the most\n fundamental institution of civilization, the union of a man and a woman in marriage.\n Attempts to redefine marriage in a single state or city could have serious consequences\n throughout the country, and anything less than a Constitutional amendment, passed by the\n Congress and ratified by the states, is vulnerable to being overturned by activist judges.\n On a matter of such importance, the voice of the people must be heard. The\n Constitutional amendment process guarantees that the final decision will rest with the\n American people and their elected representatives. President Bush will also vigorously\n defend the Defense of Marriage Act, which was supported by both parties and passed by\n 85 votes in the Senate. This common sense law reaffirms the right of states not to\n recognize same-sex marriages licensed in other states.\n Page 84\n President Bush said, \"We will not stand for judges who undermine democracy by\n legislating from the bench and try to remake America by court order.\" The Republican\n House of Representatives has responded to this challenge by passing H.R. 3313, a bill to\n withdraw jurisdiction from the federal courts over the Defense of Marriage Act. We urge\n Congress to use its Article III power to enact this into law, so that activist federal judges\n cannot force 49 other states to approve and recognize Massachusetts' attempt to redefine\n marriage.\n \n\n \n unless something has changed since 2004, their official platform is against gay marriage.",

I have even been thinking about loudly protesting marriages at churches that oppose and have fought against gay marriage. If i can't get married then those opposed need to have their day ruined. Yes I know a little vindictive but they are asking me for accepance of something I am morally opposed to while not extending me that same acceptance. How is this equal? That is all I want equality one way or another. Either we can all get married to the person of our choosing or no one should be able to get married.",

   "It is also there to protect the minority from the tyranny of the majority.\n\n \n Yes, we know. That particular side of it is the only side of it that's drilled into the U.S. population ad nauseum by special interest groups all the time, as if we don't already know it. The part that seems to get forgotten is the point of protection from the minority. One would think that after awhile of not convincing America that those special interest groups would get the picture that maybe, just maybe, the majority isn't really out to hurt the minority at all, but rather to simply prevent some grops from getting special rights. \n \n \nYour religion is pathetically poor reason to hurt other people's familes' in a society where there is supposed to be religious freedom. \n\n \n There's that accusation again. That somehow, quantitatively, people's families are really being \"hurt\" by all this. \n \n If the issue here is equality, then fine. I find that argument a lot easier to believe simply because one group is getting benefits and the other isn't. But to say that one group is truly being \"harmed\" or \"hurt\" as a result just doesn't pass muster. It's like saying that because senior citizens are getting social security benefits that people under 62 are being \"hurt\" as a result. (After all, there are probably people under 62 that in some cases need the money more than seniors.) Marriage benefits are not a form of wellfare. They aren't really there for the purpose of helping the poor and destitute. There may be cases where some families have been inconvenienced and struggled more, but when it comes to what is basically a form of govt.-provided social benefits NOT designed as a form of welfare, saying that the absense of them causes real harm is a stretch. Besides, co-habitating singles who would prefer not to enter in to marriage don't get those benefits either.\n \n It's like complaining you're being harmed or hurt as a down-on-your-luck non-handicapped person because the already-well-to-do guy in the wheel chair next door is drawing a disability check.\n \n (I assume that your use of the word \"hurt\" is over married people getting benefits and non-married people-gays in this case- not getting benefits.)",
