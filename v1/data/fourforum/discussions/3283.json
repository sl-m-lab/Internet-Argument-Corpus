We have come to know of the atrocities that were all tied to religion such as the Holocaust, African-American enslavement, and the persecution of Jews. \n \n In his book, \"Holy Horrors: An Illustrated History of Religious Murder and Madness,\" James A. Haught chronicles a thousand years of religious hate ranging from the witch hunts, to the numerous crusades, to the Holy Inquisition, to the religious anti-Semitic influence that later fueled the Holocaust. Haught says, \"Millions of innocent men, women and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have been burned, tortured, fined, and imprisoned, yet we have not advanced one inch towards uniformity. What has been the effect of the coercion? To make one half of the world fools and the other half hypocrites.\" Furthermore, theologian Richard Rubenstein wrote that the Nazis \"did not invent a new villain...they took over the 2,000-year-old Christian tradition of the Jew as a villain. The roots of the death camps must be sought in the mythic structure of Christianity.\" \n \n We have also seen throughout history how numerous religious leaders and common people have pointed to specific passages in the Bible that have been used to validate slavery. One insightful book, \"Noah's Curse: The Biblical Justification of American Slavery,\" by Stephen R. Haynes, further shows how just \"one\" biblical passage fueled anti-African-American sentiment over the course of hundreds of years. The biblical passage, \"A servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren,\" reads Noah's curse on Ham. Ham is later identified as the ancestor of black Africans, and this particular biblical passage is just one that has been used historically to justify African-American slavery. Also many Christian clergymen throughout history were pro-slavery. Historian Larry Hise says in his book, \"Pro Slavery,\" that ministers \"wrote almost half of all defenses of slavery published in America.\" He also lists more than 250 religious men who used the Bible to prove white people were entitled to own black people. \n \n Similarly, Hitler and other anti-Semitic leaders throughout history have used biblical passages to validate the persecution of Jews. Here is just one passage that fueled anti-Semitism: \"You suffered from your own countrymen the same things those churches suffered from the Jews, who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets and also drove us out. They displease God and are hostile to all men in their effort to keep us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved. In this way they always heap up their sins to the limit. The wrath of God has come upon them at last.\" (1 Thessalonians 2:14-16). \n \n In the year 2000, Pope John Paul II issued a historical pardon at St. Peter's Basilica regarding the Catholic Church's prime role in the persecution of Jews for the past 1,000 years. In addition, they also released a document that named (and officially validated) other multiple \"sins\" on their part including the Holocaust, Inquisition, Crusades and other religious acts. \n \n Not surprisingly, comparable negative sentiment that existed hundreds of years ago against African-Americans and Jews, fixated on non-heterosexuals around 50 years ago during its national peak. True, much progress has been made for gay and bisexual rights. But even today, when discussing bisexuality and heterosexuality, some people are quick to (just as in history) point to biblical passages that condemn anyone who is not heterosexual. \n \n Earlier this year we witnessed a progressive change in history as gay and bisexual men and women fought back against hegemonic norms and married in San Francisco. With the right time to pass, it will not be long when equal marriage rights under the law will be given to non-heterosexuals; similar to the way segregation was outlawed and ruled unconstitutional in the 1960s despite such opposition. \n \n Still, some do not consider gay and bisexual rights a \"civil rights\" issue. However, Coretta Scott King, wife of the late Martin Luther King Jr., disagrees with them. In 1998, on the 30th anniversary of her husband's assassination she commented: \"I still hear people say that I should... stick to the issue of racial justice, but I hasten to remind them Martin Luther King Jr. said, 'Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.' \" I appeal to everyone who believes in Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream to make room at the table of brother-and-sisterhood for lesbian and gay (and bisexual) people.\" \n \n Clearly, religion has also been used against women throughout history, which has solidly set the foundation for our dominating patriarchal world. One such biblical passage has been used to prohibit women from being ministers: \"Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak.\" (I Corinthians I 4:34). Many believe this biblical passage and others like it fueled misogynistic beliefs at the time, which viewed women as merely second-class citizens. Not long after, The Women's Suffrage Movement was a prime example of how women fought against the male-dominated world. Finally with the passage of the 19th Amendment, women got their long-deserved right to vote. \n \n \n Yes, it is true more people have died in the name of God throughout our history than any other way. So it behooves us today to not forget our history, for we may be doomed to repeat it. As we have seen through hundreds of years, indeed it has been repeated. I know I will never identify myself as a Catholic or with any other religion that is not in line with my life-changing (progressive) and liberal beliefs. However, I do believe in God very much and always will; there is a higher Creator, and I believe that our higher Creator would want us to most definitely learn from our horrid history, so that we will never repeat it again. The time is now for us to continue to fight for civil rights in all aspects. The work is never done!",

Those that divide people into categories, and those who don't.\n \nLearning from religious fanaticism can prevent future atrocities\n\n So, we can't learn from other kinds of fanaticism? Say, nationalism - taken to a fanatical end?\n \nAs we reflect back upon history, one thing remains clear regardless of one?s religious affiliation or no affiliation: More people have died in the name of God than any other way throughout history.\n\n Really? What are the figures? Do you count those religious people; say Christians killed by secularists in this category?\n \nIndeed, for hundreds of years, religious elites and common people have used their own religious interpretation (and passed down interpretation) to oppress based on gender, sexual orientation, religion and ethnicity. We have come to know of the atrocities that were all tied to religion such as the Holocaust, African-American enslavement, and the persecution of Jews.\n\n So it only goes back hundreds of years?

He also lists more than 250 religious men who used the Bible to prove white people were entitled to own black people. \n\n Pity it fails to mention the Christian arguments that ended slavery. Or, the leading Christians who played a major role in its demise; Wilberforce in the UK, and Garrison in the USA.\n \nSimilarly, Hitler and other anti-Semitic leaders throughout history have used biblical passages to validate the persecution of Jews. Here is just one passage that fueled anti-Semitism: ?You suffered from your own countrymen the same things those churches suffered from the Jews, who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets and also drove us out.

Let's say he was mad. What a mad man says to justify his actions is not the fault of the person he (mis-)quotes.\n See\n http://answers.org/apologetics/hitquote.html\n \n and\n \n http://kevin.davnet.org/essays/hitler.html\n \n \nIn the year 2000, Pope John Paul II issued a historical pardon at St. Peter?s Basilica regarding the Catholic Church?s prime role in the persecution of Jews for the past 1,000 years.

But even today, when discussing bisexuality and heterosexuality, some people are quick to (just as in history) point to biblical passages that condemn anyone who is not heterosexual.\n\n You think it strange that people would point to a book of their beliefs for justification of their beliefs?\n \nEarlier this year we witnessed a progressive change in history as gay and bisexual men and women fought back against hegemonic norms and married in San Francisco. With the right time to pass, it will not be long when equal marriage rights under the law will be given to non-heterosexuals; similar to the way segregation was outlawed and ruled unconstitutional in the 1960s despite such opposition.\n\n You equate 'race' which is not a matter of choice, for 'homosexuality' which is?\n \nStill, some do not consider gay and bisexual rights a ?civil rights? issue.

I appeal to everyone who believes in Martin Luther King Jr.?s dream to make room at the table of brother-and-sisterhood for lesbian and gay (and bisexual) people.? \n\n Funny you'd quote from a woman married to a religious leader (and therefore likely religious herself).

The Nazis were the state.\n \n The Inquisition was held by clergy. The state, secular to various degrees whilst Catholic, was not the clergy. The difference between church and state might seem blurred. But in 1500; all clergy in England were Catholics. Not all English were Catholics. Difference.\n \n Another difference... Nazi ideals stated that you were Jewish regardless of your religion - it was based on race. If you were Catholic, and you had one grand-parent who was a Jew, then you were considered a Jew. The comparison with religion fails, because you can convert in a religious sense, not in a racial sense.

However, on another case \"Did the Jews kill Christ\" post-modern/deconstructiona theory people seem to have lifted this guilt from them as it was the Romans who actually nailed Him to the Cross. I wonder why they are deemed by people 'innocent', and you deem the Catholic church 'guilty'. I will try to look into this - but if you've any opinion on the matter - or if you believe (now) that the Jews killed Christ, let me know (or if you think they're entirely different cases)\n \n I am not aware of any case where the state didn't carry out a sentence of death - but if I can find one, this would undermine your analogy as a 'guilty' verdict would not lead directly to death. I will have a look and see what I can find. However the only thing that comes to mind is that we separate now the spheres of government so that the judge does not pull the switch.
