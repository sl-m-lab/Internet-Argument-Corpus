I have my doubts. \n I ask why would parents bring their child to a place where they don't know what their child does?\n Maybe Mr. Jackson just wants inspiration from children for his music?\n Whatever the reasoning, Michael is not right in the head. \n Overall I think he is innocent but in fairness, Neverland should be closed.\n And his involvement with children terminated.",

   "mmmmmm - I don't know if Michael is guilty or innocent. However, it would have no bearing on his music. His music will be what his music is and will have had the impact that it had, regardless of whether he is guilty or not. Michael Jackson was probably the most powerful influence in pop music in the 80s, but there are musicians that have changed music more. The Beatles, Led Zepplin, Nirvana, Jim Hendrix. I am not a huge fan of any of these bands/people - but I know their impact. As far as the 80s goes, I think Prince influenced music more. I still hear him copied every time I turn on the radio. He is tremendous. He can play dozens of intruments. His first four albums he were one man shows - produced, wrote every song, sang every vocal, played every instrument. And his guitar - oh yum!",

   "Well, it looks like Michael's been indicted. I guess he'll stand trial. I'm guessing he'll be convicted and sent to prison.\n \n I don't care how good his music is, he'll learn how to sing better in prison.\n \n Michael Jackson, America's favorite FREAK!\n \n Where else can a poor black boy grow up to be a rich white woman?",
