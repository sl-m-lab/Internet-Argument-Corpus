   "Question, do you believe gambling is an addiction, and can it be placed in the same category as an addiction to narcotics?\n \n I've posted this after a recent event here in Australia. A televsion program went to air a few days ago, informing the public that a class action was being taken out against pubs and clubs that supply poker machines as part of their entertainment. The class action is for 'addicted' gamblers to reclaim losses sustained. \n \n Personally I believe it is absurd. Gambling, to me, is not an addiction. There is no chemical deposited in a person while they are playing a machine (cigarettes = nicotene etc), so if someone is to play more than they should, it is entirely their fault. I can't believe that someone simply can not stop gambling. I ask a simple question, when are people going to take responsibility for their own actions? No one forces another person to feed money into a machine and to argue otherwise, I believe, is pathetic. Calling gambling an addiction is nothing more than attempt to excuse the poor levels of willpower some hold, in an attempt to dodge responsibility. \n \n Look 3 years down the track if this law suit actually succeeded, we will most likely see customers from department stores suing shops because they are addicted to buying shoes. People already claim that shopping is an addiction, so although this example may sound ridiculous now, it could happen. \n \n Over the past 10 years society has degenerated into a place where it is always somebody elses fault, there is always somebody else to blame as accountability has fallen by the wayside. Suits such as these need to be thrown out of court, with the judge laughing at those who signed on to the class action.\n \n Sorry, ending the ramble now...",

Just because it doesn't deposit chemicals into your body doesn't lessen its powerful influence. In fact, drugs derive their potency from their ability to influence the chemicals already in your body--that is they generally heighten the pleasurable sensations created by dopamine, seratonin, etc. in your brain.\n \n Behaviors can also have this effect on people. Things like gambling, sex, and exercise (i.e. runner's high) release high levels of these chemicals. Some people do get addicted to these pleasurable sensations whether the facilitator is heroin, alcohol, or gambling. (It is my understanding, that unlike drugs, gambling recovery doesn't have a physical withdrawal component).\n \n I agree on the personal responsibility thing though. Nobody is forcing someone to play slots or buy booze. It is a choice that people make for themselves. I think we should be compassionate in that we should have mechanisms in place to help people who choose to do so, overcome their addictions. But in no way, shape, or form should people be punished for offering legal activities that a minority of people will abuse.\n \n That is my take on it.\n \n Whistler",
