   "I've noticed a disturbing trend in the threads. For every spiritual question that arises, there has to be some atheist that steps in and attempts to shoot it down. I don't understand that, what's the point? First of all, this is a religion forum and since you don't have religion then why even bother posting in a forum that's dedicated to something you don't have or understand. Or is it that you really consider atheism to be the new religion of the world, the faith of self? I'm sorry just please explain this. An atheist posting about religion is like a high schooler posting about superstrings and quantum physics.\n \n And what is the point of the incessant ranting about how there is no God and that it's all a lie and anyone who believes in God is a fool? It sounds to me like you're trying to convince yourselves above anyone else that what you're saying is true, like your little daily affirmation. If we choose to believe in God then let it be, and if you choose not to, then by all means, go ahead. But I find it a little hypocritical that you criticize religion for attempting to cram its beliefs down the throats of others when in fact you're doing the same. If God really is just an illusion, made by man to comfort him from the harse reality that we are all alone, so what? Why does that offend you, and make you think you should unite in your own holy crusade of truth? Let a person believe what they want, it has no bearing on what's going to happen to you. \n \n So in closing, I would like to say that I am not posting this to be a jerk or someone trying to get a shot in. I'm just sick and tired of hearing that there is no God, there is no God, there is no God, when this is a RELIGION forum. If you don't believe in a higher power and you're fine with that, then more power to you. But please stop trying to prove everyone else wrong just because God Himself hasn't come down and met with you face to face like you think He rightly should.",

An atheist posting about religion is like a high schooler posting about superstrings and quantum physics.\n\n \n Don't be rediculous. An atheist posting about religion is like a former scientist of superstring theory bashing the superstring theory. An atheist is generally someone who understands religion but rejects it. It isn't like they know nothing about it at all hence the reason they are able to debate you about it. Also they are here debating it with you for the same reason that this scientist would be debating others about the string theory. Just because you don't believe in something doesn't mean you shouldn't try to convince others that you are right. So what is the point of the scientist who doesn't believe in the string theory?\n \n \nAnd what is the point of the incessant ranting about how there is no God and that it's all a lie and anyone who believes in God is a fool? It sounds to me like you're trying to convince yourselves above anyone else that what you're saying is true, like your little daily affirmation.\n\n \n Hey buddy, look in the mirror. Praising God 24/7 makes it sound like you are just trying to convince yourself he exists. Also this post stating how you dislike hearing atheist arguments backs this statement up.\n \n \nIf we choose to believe in God then let it be, and if you choose not to, then by all means, go ahead. But I find it a little hypocritical that you criticize religion for attempting to cram its beliefs down the throats of others when in fact you're doing the same.

Why does that offend you, and make you think you should unite in your own holy crusade of truth? Let a person believe what they want, it has no bearing on what's going to happen to you.\n \n \n Personally I find it offensive that you would state that if God is an illusion so what and still teach this stuff to your children as fact. You clearly don't care if what you are teaching is true or not. That is part of the reason it can be found offensive by those who don't believe it is fact. It is just like many Christians are offended that evolution is taught as fact. You will stand up and try to cram the idea down everyones throat that it is false.\n \n \nSo in closing, I would like to say that I am not posting this to be a jerk or someone trying to get a shot in. I'm just sick and tired of hearing that there is no God, there is no God, there is no God, when this is a RELIGION forum. If you don't believe in a higher power and you're fine with that, then more power to you.\n\n \n Religion has everything to do with whether God exists or not. We are also in a debate forum more than we are in a religion forum. If you want to eliminate the atheist side then go to another site because doing that here would destroy the whole purpose of this religious forum.\n \n \nBut please stop trying to prove everyone else wrong just because God Himself hasn't come down and met with you face to face like you think He rightly should.\n\n \n I'm also surprised how many Christians believe it is their duty to inform others about God yet you stand here today stating that atheists should just stay quiet because they havn't met God yet.",

   "Well as an atheist who has done this enough times, I can't help feeling this is aimed partly at me, so will interject.\n \n Firstly I do very much consider atheism to be a religion, even if not in it's conventional sense. It is a system of faith based belief on the nature of God. It has every right to be discussed on a religious forum. How does an 'atheist posting about religion is like a high schooler posting about superstrings and quantum physics'? \n \n It is a different viewpoint, you can not (read: should not) look down on it like that just because you don't agree with it. I have read the bible and generally know a damn site more about religion than your average Christian drone, so please don't patronise me because of my own beliefs.\n \n When I enter a religious thread I do so to bring my own opinion to the subject being discussed. Now if my opinion happens to run contrary to that of the poster should I stifle myself? Of course not, this intended for intelligent debate not a place where we can all sing 'praise to the LAWD'! \n \n People are entitled to bring whatever opinion they want to these forums, if I started a political thread I could hardly complain if people of a different political alignment posted and disagreed with my stance. I see no difference here. \n \n Biased as I may be, I have never seen an atheist on this forum 'attempting to cram its beliefs down the throats of others', I have seen many Christians. Yes we can be hypocritical over this, but that's human nature. Talk to them, point out their hypocrisy. That is the point of being here.",
