   "One of the things I have come across repeatedly in the last few weeks is the argument by creationists (and in some cases ID'ers) that unless human life was created (or designed) by a God, we are all meaningless. One person on UK Radio 2 last week claimed that faith schools do better because children become despondant when taught about evolution....\n \n The topic I'd like to raise is this: Why do creationists / ID'ers believe this? Surely surveying the expanse of evolutionary history and realising just what we have is a very uplifting feeling? Or is it just me? \n \n I like the idea that of all the flukes that ever happened I was one of them. The fact that this 'random' (Couldn't think of a better word, but I know what Pandion and electrolyte will say :) ) process has lead to a creature able to produce complex culture, languages and art surely shows us just how amazing evolution is.\n \n Anyway, views please!",

   "I was raised as a Roman Catholic and went to a Catholic grade school. In sixth grade, Sister Mary Matthew was teaching us evolution in science class. The conflict with the biblical version of our origins was obvious. I remember asking her about this and I will never forget her response. She asked me to consider the seven days of Genesis. Then she asked me to think about how, out of all of the cosmos, that the earth, and then life and then we came to be, according to scientific theory. She then asked me to decide which I thought was more wonderful. I decided then and there.\n \n Sister Mary Matthew rocked.",

   "So they're saying that if some all-powerful being just created you out of nothing then you're not worthless, yet if your ancestors started out as amoeba and evolved their way up for millions and millions of years then you are worthless?\n \n That make sense...\n \n *edit* Thelmoose, if I asked you to decide which is more wonderful - the scientific explanation for gravity, or the mystic winds of the ancient Persians sending their spirit guardians to us, which would you pick?",

   "\n *edit* Thelmoose, if I asked you to decide which is more wonderful - the scientific explanation for gravity, or the mystic winds of the ancient Persians sending their spirit guardians to us, which would you pick?\n\n \n That's a great question. My first gut reaction was the myth. The mystic winds has a nice flair to it, but the decision here would be between the two, assuming I believed them both equally as fact. \n \n Given that, I would think the theory of gravity would win out. \n \n An interesting thought came to me with this. I was immediately intrigued by the ancient Persian mystic winds. I am not delighted in any way with the story of Genesis. Trying to be honest with myself, I guess I have to say that I have developed such antipathy toward Christianity, thanks to the malevolence of its followers, that I cannot appreciate any beauty there may be in the literature of the Bible. I will have to think about that.\n \n Thank you for the food for thought.",

   "I asked which was more wonderous and to me I think the mystic Persian winds are more wondrous than plain old gravity.\n \n See, when you decided between evolution and creationism, you seemed to do it based on the wonder factor rather than the factual evidence supporting the theory. Hence why you chose creationism\n \n So by the same logic, the Persian winds are more wonderous than gravity so you should pick them too.",

Considering the possibility that we evolved from primordial ooze to Beethoven's 9th Symphony, 3rd movement is a thrilling idea to me. It makes me appreciate how wonderful life is. \n \n [I stated this before in the Religion forum  here .]\n \n The idea of this thread, that the naturalistic explanation is plenty wonderful is something I wholly agree with. I completely fail to see why making these glorious things \"god-given\" makes them any better.",
