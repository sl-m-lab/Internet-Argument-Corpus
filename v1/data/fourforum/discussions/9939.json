They believe the bible is 100% factual and true and every word came straight from Gods hand. Conservative christians do not have open minds. Only liberals have open minds and liberals do not believe in the literal truth of the bible.\n \n \n Then to the op of the thread. You are right we have no more proof the Santa exisits then Jesus. I as a child never bought the Santa arguement it just didn't make sense. The same can be said for the bible it just dosen't make sense. You get so many confusing arguments. If God is love and accepting then why the need for Jesus to die. If God has the power to forgive then why all the mess and pain?",
