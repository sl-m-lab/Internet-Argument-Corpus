   "Thanks for responding Broker.\n \n I disagree with you. When bleeding hearts try to fix things (like welfare for the poor, liberty for another country), things usually get worse for them and us. Personally I believe a lasting liberty should come from within.\n \n I have another question. Saddam was not a good guy. Like many dictators around the world he killed and locked up many opponents. He was one of the few rulers in the Mid East that had Christians in his government and governed the most non-secular state in the region. He locked up many criminals and political opponents; the vast majority were Muslim Extremists. Now our President says the \"prisons are empty in Iraq\", implying that the political prisoners were freed (many now vying for political power). \n \n Now here is my question for you or whoever:\n Will the new government \"IF FREE ELECTIONS ARE HELD\" be more or less non-secular than the one Saddam had?\n \n Here is my viewpoint: We should not be in the UN. We should have never gone along with UN sanctions against Iraq. Our companies should have been able to deal with whomever the wish. Our government should have taken the role as the \"sleeping giant\".",

   "Well Iraq is now not a threat to us and won't be again for a very long time and as a result Saudi Arabia is no longer locked in as our #1 oil provider so they have to fear us and Iran will never again be able to do anything without the thought of the US having armies march through Iraq into their country and the same goes for all muslim nations around Israel. Israel and Palestine have also been getting along rather well now which sets aside another Middle East conflict. What if 10 years from now the Middle East is completely peaceful? What if Iraq and Palestine brought about this peace? Which country is most responsible for this peace then? Bush wanted America to have another source of oil and he wanted to become more popular, but also he did make a good move here IMO.\n \n As far as America becoming a 3rd world country in the future, modern society and government is much different than that of Rome and England. Eventually the US will not be #1 in everything as they are today. China will probably share the spot light with the US in a while and eventually India, the EU, and Russia will join the party. Assuming no nuclear war occurs, it probably is just a matter of time before there is no Superpower country and the term for economic success \"West\" will be changed to \"North\". It would take a major disaster to make the US a 3rd world country and although this disaster can happen and may even be likely to happen, it won't happen in the same way as it did in the past. If nuclear war does break out, a lot of major countries will go 3rd world quickly even if they are not directly involved in the war.",

So I think they're pretty secure.\n\n \n Our birth rates are not exactly that substantial right now even when compared to Europe and Russia. We have a growth rate of under 1% and they have a growth rate of just over break even in many cases. In the industrialized world growth rates are not going to be as large as they are in other societies. Population is always going to be a factor in how powerful a nation is but only if the political and economic sides of the society work as well.\n \n Of course we are strong enough to invade Iran. We did handle Iraq as far as the invasion went and it went better than anyone could have expected. SilentPoet mentioned the nuclear capabilities of the US but I seriously doubt we would need to resort to that to win in Iran. We didn't come close to sending in all our forces in Iraq and we didn't even have a whole lot of support there. I think that if it really came down to it the US could conquer most of the world if we wanted to put everything we had into it. However when dealing with the war in Iraq we didn't come close to putting everything we had into it. We could have bombed the country from a distance and waited for the whole thing to collapse. We could have nuked it sped up that process. We could have used chemical and biological weapons against it and really sped up the process. We could have marched in with our entire force and not taken prisoners, shooting first and asking questions later. But that isn't the way we do war. That is the only thing that prevents us from being far more successful is how civilly we fight wars. We plan our wars around the idea that the country and its people will need to be intact so that we can later rebuild it. If our forces turned Iraq into a police state right now then they could get it under control more quickly but they want them to be democratic and don't want to boss them around like that.\n \n I don't think Iran would be too happy about war with the US and I don't think they would have the illusion that they could win a war like that. So I hope they try to stay away from creating any WMDs.",
