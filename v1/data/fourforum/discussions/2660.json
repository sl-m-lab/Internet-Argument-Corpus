   "I've got some questions about the legal future of gay marriage. Any lawyers out there who can let me know if this is on the right track or not?\n \n First, the current situation. Gay marriage is legal in Mass. A constitutional ammendment is in the works, but can't be in place for two more years. The govenor is asking that a 100 year old law be applied to prevent gay out-of-staters from getting married.\n \n Now, my question. DOMA (Defense of marriage act) says one state doesn't have to recognize another states gay marriage. Alot of individual states have laws saying they won't recognize gay marriage. However, the Constitution is very clear about this. A legal contract in one state must be recognized by all other states. Neither state nor federal law can override this. So, while no state can be reuqired to allow gay marriages to be performed in their state, neither can they refuse to recognize marriages performed in other states.\n \n Any one know if this analysis is correct?",

   "You are correct. There are many gay families who are challenging their state laws based on the US constitution. That is why there are so many people contesting against their states constitution bans on this issue. They can still fight and eventually win, but it takes time. It's a race right now. The sooner the \"ban\" starts making it's way though congress, the better it is for those that oppose legalizing gay marriage in the other 49 states.\n \n One really cool thing that was pointed out to me is that since the state of Mass has legalized gay marriage, thousands of same sex couples have married and once you open that barn door, it's hard to close it again.",

   "No, there is nothing in the US constitution to ban gay marriages.\n \n There are state constitutions though the US that say \"marriages must be between one man and one woman\" (like in Texas). Us gay people feel this is unconstitutional and are appealing to the courts (at both state and federal). Right now, marriage is a states right, not a federal one. The people who don't want gay marriages to become legal are pushing the the federal government to make marriage laws federal (applies to all states) so that gay marriages cannot occur anywhere within the US. The US constitution overrides anything that state constitutions say.",

   "As I said, I am not a lawyer, and would very much like to hear from any actuall lawyers out there. However, I don't think your interpretation is quite correct. The US constitution neither requires nor forbids gay marriage. Anything not spelled out in the constitution or federal law is left to the states. Therefore, its fully legal for the states to write into their constitutions that they won't sanction gay marriage. The only way to change that is to elect enough pro-gay-marriage people to get the laws changed.",
