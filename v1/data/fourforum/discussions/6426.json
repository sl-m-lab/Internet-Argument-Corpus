   "I won't cite the site for this but if persons grouse, I'll find an equally graphic site and post that citation, along with the info:\n \n Dr. Smith's Story \n \n I don't think I ever believed I would become an abortion provider. In the early 1960's I was a Dr. in the last stages of my hospital training when I first encountered the horrible and unspeakable aftermath of illegal abortion. Day in and day out, I saw women in the emergency room of my hospital that had gone to unbelievable lengths to terminate their unintended and unwanted pregnancies. They were the very young, the women nearing menopause, the married, the unmarried, the wealthy, and the poor all unique, all scared & all desperate. \n \n Whatever their reasons, whatever their circumstances, they were determined. The most difficult were the women who did very dangerous things to themselves to terminate a pregnancy. The women who attempted self-abortion were scared, very scared. But they were more afraid of not terminating their pregnancies - whatever ended up happening - and no matter if their actions were illegal. \n \n No doctor of conscience could witness on a daily basis what I did and not conclude that illegal abortion is wrong and immoral. \n \n Many people, my own peers even, have asked me what was the final straw, what pushed me into becoming and abortion provider and taking on all the personal risk and risk to my family. If only they had been there on October 19, 1961. I was 26. It was my first 24-hour day in the emergency room and one I will never forget. \n \n I had been there for about 3 hours when a woman was brought into the ER - it was a very busy day. Everyone running here and there...it was a hot day. I helplessly watched in disbelief. A woman had tried to abort her pregnancy at home. She had gotten some hollow tubing into her cervix and - and she had put turpentine down the tube into her uterus. It - It had literally cooked the lining of her uterus. She was in and out of consciousness, in and out of screaming in horrible pain. Screams I still hear. They took her to surgery right away and they removed her uterus. I had never seen anything like that - had never heard of anything so brutal. \n \n My shift was nearly over and I had convinced myself that I wouldn't see another woman that day suffer from an illegal abortion, but I was sadly mistaken. I was only 10 minutes away from finishing my shift that day, when a doctor visited Dr. Buckley, my supervising doctor. \n \n They talked quickly & called me. We went outside with this other doctor to deal with a trauma case. Nothing I had ever seen, even under the most adverse conditions prepared me for what I was about to see. It was beyond my experience. In this doctor's car was a woman, almost unconscious and bleeding profusely. When Dr. Buckley and I lifted her onto the gurney, her dress pushed up above her hips. I'll never forget what I saw. She had a loop of bowel hanging out of her vagina. It was wrapped in newspaper. \n \n The doctor who had brought her in had perforated her uterus while he was doing the abortion; he had pulled out the bowel with his instrument. She had over 30 inches of bowel hanging out of her vagina. To this day I don't know how I helped Dr. Buckley get her into surgery. Dr. Buckley did a bowel resection; he pulled the dirty bowel out of the uterus and vagina. We worked to save her but our efforts were unsuccessful. I stayed with her body for an hour afterward, unable to comprehend so much tragedy in one night. . . .",

   "Yeah, so what about it?\n\n It's just incredibly bad fact-twisting.\n \n \nBut how often do contraceptives fail?\n \n Planned Parenthood's Alan Guttmacher Institute reported on 10,000 women getting abortions. Of these, 57.5% said they were using a contraceptive the month they became pregnant. In a similar study in 1987 the figure was 51.3%.\n\n Contraceptives (for example a condom/ the pill) aren't going to last a month effectively. Then there's the fact that contraceptives, given the above data, can still be 99% effective, as it doesn't mention how many pregnancies they've prevented.\n \n What does the writer make of this though? \"According to this, condoms have a high failure rate for pregnancy.\"\n \n emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \nActually, they are not very effective at all. Undoubtedly because a condom retains the bulk of the discharge of semen, the rate is cut down. To become infected with any disease, two things are relevant in terms of the offending, invasive agent. One is the presence of some of those viruses, or germs, itself. The other is the quantity of that agent entering the body. If there are only a few bugs, the average human will kill them off. If there's a very heavy dose, the chance for an infection succeeding is greater. Therefore, by cutting down on the volume of semen, a condom certainly reduces the chance for AIDS. But AIDS viruses do get through the condom.\n\n Why is the rate of AIDS so high in Africa then, where donoms are rare, but so low in the Western world, where condoms are the norm.\n \n -Wez",
