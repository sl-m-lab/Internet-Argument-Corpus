   "I've started this because Spartacus and Maximus have been raising discussion on the Papacy\n \n A Catholic claim for Papal power typically states that Peter is the ?rock? on which the church was established. A survey of early church fathers commentaries[i] shows seventeen Fathers thought of the rock as Peter, forty-four thought it referred to Peter?s confession of faith, sixteen thought Christ himself was the rock, while eight thought that the rock meant all of the Apostles. Thus 80% of these Church Fathers did not recognise ?the rock? as meaning Peter alone. Such a claim of Catholic commission therefore is not so clear.\n St. Augustine of Hippo wrote ?See what praises follow this faith. ?Thou\n art Peter, and upon this rock I will build this Church. What meaneth, ?Upon this rock I will build My Church?? Upon this faith; upon this that has been said, ?Thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God. Upon this rock,? saith He, ?I will build My Church? (Homily X on John V. 1-3)[ii]\n St. Cyprian stated ?Faith is the foundation of the Church, for it was not of the person but of the faith of St. Peter that it was said that the gates of hell should not prevail against it; it is the confession of faith that has vanquished hell. Jesus Christ is the Rock. He did not deny the grace of His name when He called him Peter, because he borrowed from the rock the constancy and solidity of his faith. Endeavour then, thyself to be a rock ?thy rock is thy faith, and faith is the foundation of the Church. If thou art a rock, thou shalt be in the Church for the Church is built upon the rock.?\n (De Catholicae Ecclesia Unitate, cap. 4-5) [iii]\n Turning again to St. Augustine ?Therefore Peter is so called from the rock; not the rock from Peter; as Christ is not called Christ from the\n Christian, but the Christian from Christ. Therefore, He saith, ?Thou art Peter; and upon this Rock? which thou hast confessed, upon this Rock which thou hast acknowledged saying, ?Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God, will I build My Church:? that is upon Myself, the Son of the living God, ?will I build My Church.? I will build thee upon Myself, not Myself upon thee. For men who wish to be built upon men, said, ?I am of Paul: and I of Appollos; and I of Cephas,? (1Cor. 1:12) who is Peter, but upon the Rock, said ?But I am of Christ. And when the Apostle Paul ascertained that he was chosen, and Christ despised, he said, ?Is Christ divided?? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?? (1Cor 1:13) And, as not in the name of Paul, so neither in the name of Peter; but in the name of Christ: that Peter might be built upon the Rock, not the Rock upon Peter.? (Sermon XXVI Matt. XIV, 25) [iv]\n Further, the power of binding and loosing is given to all the Apostles (Mat 18:18). Thus to turn to St. Augustine once more.\n ?He had not the primacy over the disciples (in discipulos) but among the disciples (in disipulis). His primacy among the disciples was the same as that of Stephen among the deacons.? (Sermon 10 on Peter and Paul). [v]\n We can see how the Apostles viewed each other in the book of Acts. Acts 15:2 'This brought Paul and Barnabas into sharp dispute and debate with them. So Paul and Barnabas were appointed, along with some other believers, to go up to Jerusalem to see the apostles and elders about this question.' That a) they were in dispute, and b) they sought the elders, not Peter alone. When we look at the first council, that of Jerusalem (Acts 15) it was presided over by James, who also rendered the final judgment, even as Peter was present. ?When they finished, James spoke up:?It is my judgment, therefore, that we should not make it difficult for the Gentiles who are turning to God.?\n Eusebius wrote of this in his church history (note he also quotes Clement ? a supposed Papal prince). ?This James, whom the early Christians surnamed the Righteous because of his outstanding virtue, was the first, as the records tell us, to be elected to the Episcopal throne of the Jerusalem church. Clement, in Outlines Book VI, puts it thus: ?Peter, James, and John, after the Ascension of the Saviour, did not claim pre-eminence because the Saviour had especially honoured them, but chose James the Righteous as Bishop of Jerusalem.? (The History of the Church ? II.I) [vi]\n (see also Appendix B)\n Look at Acts 15:22 ?Then the apostles and elders, with the whole church, decided to choose some of their own men and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They chose Judas (called Barsabbas) and Silas, two men who were leaders among the brothers? That is, the council in session decided, not a pontiff, Peter. Thus, St. Cyprian says ?For neither did Peter, whom first the Lord chose, when Paul disputed with him afterwards about the circumcision, claim anything to himself insolently, nor arrogantly assume anything, so as to say that he held primacy, and that he out to be obeyed to novices and those lately come.? (Epistle LXX concerning the baptism of Heretics). [vii]\n The claim too of Peter?s succession falls down in light of the fact that he founded many churches, not just Rome. My own church is Antiochian, a\n See established by Peter before he went to Rome. Yet this church was lower than Alexandria founded by St. Mark. Why is it that a church founded by the ?primary Apostle? be accorded lower honour than that of St. Mark? Rome became first in honour because it was the political centre of the Roman world. Thus it was because of politics, not spirituality that saw Rome?s place established. Canon 6 of the First Council of Nicea ?Let the ancient customs in Egypt, Libya and Pentapolis prevail, that the Bishop of Alexandria have jurisdiction in all these, since the like is customary for the Bishop of Rome also. Likewise, in Antioch and the other provinces, let the Churches retain their privileges.?[viii] (see Appendix C)\n St. Cyprian said ?In the administration of the Church each bishop has the free discretion of his own will, having to account only to the Lord\n for his actions. None of us may set himself up as bishop of bishops, nor compel his brothers to obey him; every bishop of the Church has full\n liberty and complete power; as he cannot be judged by another, neither can he judge another.? (spoken at the opening address of the Council of Carthage).[ix]\n Ignatius of Antioch thus addresses a letter to the Romans as a church in charge of local affairs. He begins his Epistle ??to the Church that is in\n charge of affairs in Roman quarters.?[x] (Note he doesn?t say ?To the church that is in charge everywhere throughout the Christian world.?)\n Other claims by the Catholic church on the ?exercise? of papal power fail upon closer inspection. Pope St. Victor (189-199) is sometimes claimed by Catholics as the first to demonstrate supreme power over the whole Christian world. \n The Church in Asia Minor celebrated Easter on a different day from the rest of the Christian churches, and although he initiated a synod to investigate, this was done by request, not command. Polycrates, Bishop of Ephesus wrote to St. Victor ?Victor and the Roman Church?, (Eusebius ? v. 24). [xi] Eusebius further says ?There is extant to this day a letter from those who attended a conference in Palestine presided over by Bishop Theophilus of Caesarea and Narcissus of Jerusalem; and from those at Rome a similar one, arising out of the same controversy, which names Victor as bishop. There are others from the Pontic bishops, presided over by Palmas as the senior; from the Gallic province, over which Irenaeus was archbishop, and from the bishops in Osrhoene and the cities of that region. There are personal letters from Bishop Bacchyllus of Corinth and very many more, who voiced the same opinion and judgment and gave the same vote. All these laid down\n one single rule the rule already stated.? (Eusebius ? v. 25).[xii]\n Thus the decree came from the conference, not from the Pope. Polycrates disputed the council, however. Eusebius said\n ?Thereupon Victor, head of the Roman Church attempted at one stroke to cut off from the common unity all the Asian diocese, together with the neighboring churches, on the ground of heterodoxy.? [xiii]\n NOTE: Attempted\n He failed because ??this was not tot the taste of all the bishops: they replied with a request that he would turn his mind to the things that make\n for peace and unity and love towards his neighbours. We still possess the words of these men who very sternly rebuked Victor. Among them was Irenaeus, who wrote on behalf of the Christians for whom he was responsible for in Gaul.?[xiv] This hardly suggest universal over-lordship as understood by the early church. \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------ENDNOTES\n [i] Jean de Launoy Epist.

   "To understand if the church understood the Papacy, as Catholics now claim, we need only look at the Ecumenical Councils... All were called by the Emperor, not the Pope. The Second Ecumenical Council was called without the knowledge of the Pope, and the Fourth and Firth Ecumenical Councils were called against his\n express wishes.\n Catholics make much use of the words of these councils. One of the main Catholic 'evidences' comes from the belief that Cyril, Bishop of Alexandria acted as the Pope's (Celestine) servant, in the Nestorian debates. Pope Pius XI claimed that the 3rd Ecumenical Council established papal supremacy.\n ?But Cyril said... \"Peter and John were both Apostles and saints and adorned with equal honours and powers\" (P G Migne, 76:65).[i] In fact, specifically in this debate, Pope Celestine held a synod in Rome in which he condemned Nestorius. He then wrote to Cyril informing him of this decision. Importantly, Cyril convened a council in Alexandria to discuss the issues raised in the Pope's letter, and they too condemned Nestorius. This is important, because even though the Pope had ruled on this, and had informed Cyril, Cyril did not just 'obey', but instead called a council of those in his own See. This was because as Cyril understood it, he was the boss of his own area. What was ruled in Rome did not affect him.\n Catholics continue to re-write Council teachings\n ?Third Ecumenical Council: Ephesus (431)\n The Council of Ephesus, of more than 200 bishops, presided over by St.\n Cyril of Alexandria representing Pope Celestine I, defined the true\n personal unity of Christ, declared Mary the Mother of God (theotokos)\n against Nestorius, Bishop of Constantinople, and renewed the condemnation\n of Pelagius.?[ii]\n This falsehood stems from Pius XI's declaration (in Lux Veritatis) that Cyril, Patriarch of Alexandria was a papal legate. Pope Celestine never refers to Patriarch Cyril as legate in correspondence to the Council, and only describes Arcadius, Projetus, and Philip as those who \"filled the place of the Apostolic See\". (Mansi - VI, 1337).[iii] \n The fact that the Pope sent these legates at all shows that Cyril did not represent him, or else the Pope would not have sent them as his representatives. Three months before the Council had been called, Pope Celestine had issued an excommunication on Nestorius, Patriarch of Constantinople. The Council, however, ignored this and treated Nestorius as the proper Patriarch of Constantinople. The council then proceeded to examine the evidence and pronounced its own sentence: \"The holy Synod...to Nestorius the new Judas: Know that for thy impious doctrines thou was deposed by the holy Synod agreeably to the laws of the Church.\"\n (Mansi -IV, 1227).[iv]\n That is, they ignored the excommunication of Celestine and judged him for\n themselves. Pope Pius XI tried to put a spin on this saying that they merely ratified Celestine's sentence. This is not so, as shown Nestorius was accepted with honour, until the sentence was passed. The Emperor himself had invited Nestorius \"...In November the emperor, not regarding the papal condemnation as definitive, had already convoked a general council...\" \n (Leo Donald Davis (a Jesuit) \"The First Seven Ecumenical Councils (325-787) Their History and Theology\", Liturgical Press, Minnesota, 1990, p153).[v]\n Further, Roman Catholic historian Bishop Maret says \"The Pope pronounced\n in the affair of Nestorius a canonical judgment clothed with all the authority of his see. He had prescribed its execution. Yet, however, three months after this sentence and before its execution, all the episcopate is invited to examine afresh and to decide freely the question in dispute...\" (Du Concile generale et de la paix religieuse - vol1, page 183, Bishop Henri Maret Paris, 1869). [vi]\n False Catholic claims abound. Some are quite clearly placed as attempts at distorting the truth. \n Endnotes\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n [i] Whelton, p55.\n [ii] http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04423f.htm\n [iii] Whelton, p61\n [iv] Ibid, pp57-8\n [v] Ibid, p59.\n [vi] Ibid, p60",

   "APPENDIX A ? The Keys and the Rock\n The false Catholic claim is worth repeating?\n \"In Matthew 16:19, Jesus gives Peter \"the keys to the kingdom\" and the ower to bind and loose. While the latter is later given to the other apostles (Matt. 18:18), the former is not. In Luke 22:28?32, Jesus assures the apostles that they all have authority, but then he singles out Peter, conferring upon him a special pastoral authority over the other disciples which he is to exercise by strengthening their faith (22:31?32).\"[i]\n This is just simply not true. Looking at the verses just preceding it, \n Luke 22\n 24 Also a dispute arose among them as to which of them was considered to be greatest. \n 25 Jesus said to them, \"The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those who exercise authority over them call themselves Benefactors.\n 26 But you are not to be like that. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who rules like the one who serves.\n 27 For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who is at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.\n 28You are those who have stood by me in my trials.\n 29 And I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred one on me, \n 30 so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.[ii]\n We can see that Jesus had an opportunity to name Peter as the leader, and he does the very opposite. He says that they all should be equal. He speaks to them all when he says that they are to be appointed to the Kingdom. THEN he turns to speak to Simon Peter to tell him that he will betray Him.\n St. Jerome\n What did other people understand the ?rock' to mean? \"Christ is the Rock Who granted to His apostles that they should be called rock. God has founded His Church on this Rock, and it is from this Rock that Peter has been named. (6th Book on Matthew)[iii]\n Origen\n 11. The Promise Given to Peter Not Restricted to Him, But Applicable to All Disciples Like Him. But if you suppose that upon that one Peter only the whole church is built by God, what would you say about John the son of thunder or each one of the Apostles? Shall we otherwise dare to say, that against Peter in particular the gates of Hades shall not prevail, but that they shall prevail against the other Apostles and the perfect? Does not the saying\n previously made, \"The gates of Hades shall not prevail against it,\"71 hold\n in regard to all and in the case of each of them? And also the saying, \"Upon this rock I will build My church\"?72 Are the keys of the kingdom of heaven given by the Lord to Peter only, and will no other of the blessed receive them? But if this promise, \"I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven,\"73 be common to the others, how shall not all the things previously spoken of, and the things which are subjoined as having been addressed to Peter, be common to them? For in this place these words seem to be addressed as to Peter only, \"Whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven,\"74 etc; but in the Gospel of John the Saviour having given the Holy Spirit unto the disciples by breathing upon them said, \"Receive ye the Holy Spirit,\"75 etc. Many then will say to the Saviour, \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God; \"but not all who say this will say it to Him, as not at all having learned it by the revelation of flesh and blood but by the Father in heaven Himself taking away the veil that lay upon their heart, in order that after this \"with unveiled face reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord\"76 they may speak through the Spirit of God saying concerning Him, \"Lord Jesus,\" and to Him, \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.\"77 And if any one says this to Him, not by flesh and blood revealing it unto Him but through the Father in heaven, he will obtain the things that were spoken according to the letter of the Gospel to that Peter, but, as the spirit of the\n Gospel teaches, to every one who becomes such as that Peter was. For all\n bear the surname of \"rock\" who are the imitators of Christ, that is, of the spiritual rock which followed those who are being saved,78 that they may drink from it the spiritual draught. But these bear the surname of the rock just as Christ does. But also as members of Christ deriving their surname from Him they are called Christians, and from the rock, Peters. And taking occasion from these things you will say that the righteous bear the surname of Christ who is Righteousness, and the wise of Christ who is Wisdom.79 And so in regard to all His other names, you will apply them by way of surname to the saints; and to all such the saying of the Saviour might be spoken, \"Thou art Peter,\" etc., down to the words, \"prevail against it.\" But what is the \"it\"? Is it the rock upon which Christ builds the church, or is it the church? For the phrase is ambiguous. Or is it as if the rock and the church were one and the same? This I think to be true; for neither against the rock on which Christ builds the church, nor against the church will the gates of Hades prevail; just as the way of a serpent upon a rock, according to what is written in the Proverbs,80 cannot be found. Now, if the gates of Hades prevail against any one, such an one cannot be a rock upon which Christ builds the church, nor the church built by Jesus upon the rock; for the rock is inaccessible to the serpent, and it is stronger than the gates of Hades which are opposing it, so that because of its strength the gates of Hades do not prevail against it; but the church, as a building of Christ who built His own house wisely upon the rock,81 is incapable of admitting the gates of Hades which prevail against every man who is outside the rock and the church, but have no power against it.\"[iv]\n \n APPENDIX B ? The Council of Jerusalem as shown by Acts of the Apostles\n There are a few important things to note about this council.\n a) James presided, not Peter, because Jerusalem was then the most important Christian centre.\n b) When someone spoke, whomever it was, no one else spoke over them.\n That's called politeness\n Thus...\n \"When they finished, James spoke up:...\"\n That is, James waited his turn.\n Earlier...\n Acts 15:12\n \"The whole assembly became silent as they listened to Barnabas and Paul\n telling about the miraculous signs and wonders God had done among the\n Gentiles through them. \" They too had the floor, and everyone was silent.\n c) MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL James clearly made the decision\n Acts 15:19\n \"It is my judgment, therefore, that we should not make it difficult for\n the Gentiles who are turning to God.\n Note also...\n Acts 15:23\n \"With them they sent the following letter: The apostles and elders, your\n brothers, To the Gentile believers in Antioch, Syria and Cilicia:\n Greetings.\n 24 We have heard that some went out from us without our authorization and\n disturbed you, troubling your minds by what they said.\n 25 So we all agreed to choose some men and send them to you with our dear\n friends Barnabas and Paul-- 26 men who have risked their lives for the\n name of our Lord Jesus Christ That is, 'we' decided this, 'we' voted on this. Not \"Peter\" decided this. Thus \"But observe how Peter does everything with the common consent; nothing imperiously.\" St. John Chrysotomon, Homily III on Acts 1:12[v]\n \n APPENDIX C ? The Councils\n THE FIRST ECUMENICAL COUNCIL (Nicea)\n States in canon 6.\n \"The ancient customs of Egypt, Libya and Pentapolis shall be maintained, according to which the bishop of Alexandria has authority over all these places since a similar custom exists with reference to the bishop of Rome. Similarly in Antioch and the other provinces the prerogatives of the churches are to be preserved. In general the following principle is evident: if anyone is made bishop without the consent of the metropolitan, this great synod determines that such a one shall not be a bishop. If however two or three by reason of personal rivalry dissent from the common vote of all, provided it is reasonable and in accordance with the church's canon, the vote of the majority shall prevail.\"[vi] This can and has been misinterpreted by some Catholics, however the matter is made more clear in the following?\n THE SECOND ECUMENICAL COUNCIL (THE FIRST COUNCIL OF CONSTANTINOPLE) \n CANON II states \n \"THE bishops are not to go beyond their dioceses to churches lying outside of their bounds, nor bring confusion on the churches; but let the Bishop of Alexandria, according to the canons, alone administer the affairs of Egypt; and let the bishops of the East manage the East alone, the privileges of the Church in Antioch, which are mentioned in the canons of Nice, being preserved; and let the bishops of the Asian Diocese administer the Asian affairs only; and the Pontic bishops only Pontic matters; and the Thracian bishops only Thracian affairs. And let not bishops go beyond their dioceses for ordination or any other ecclesiastical ministrations, unless they be invited. And the aforesaid canon concerning dioceses being observed, it is evident that the synod of every province will administer the affairs of that particular province as was decreed at Nice. But the Churches of God in heathen nations must be governed according to the custom which has prevailed from the times of the Fathers.\"[vii]\n APPENDIX D ? Further misrepresentations and mistakes on Catholic\n web-sites.\n A number of Catholic web-sites present numerous quotes supposedly supporting Papal power?\n Here is a typical Catholic misrepresentation\n \"The Authority of the Pope: Part II: Council of Ephesus \"Philip, presbyter and legate of [Pope Celestine I] said: ?We offer our thanks to the holy and venerable synod, that when the writings of our holy and blessed pope had been read to you, the holy members, by our holy voices, you joined yourselves to the holy head also by your holy acclamations. For your blessedness is not ignorant that the head of the whole faith, the head of the apostles, is blessed Peter the apostle. And since now [we], after having been tempest-tossed and much vexed, [have] arrived, we ask that you order that there be laid before us what things were done in this holy synod before our arrival; in order that according to the opinion of our blessed pope and of this present holy assembly, we likewise may ratify their determination'\" (Acts of the Council, session 2 [A.D. 431]).\"[viii]\n Yet look how the proceedings are actually spelled out?\n \"The holy and ecumenical Synod, gathered together in Ephesus by the decree of our most religious Emperors, to the bishops, presbyters, deacons, and all the people in every province and city:\n When we had assembled, according to the religious decree [of the Emperors]?\"[ix] That is, the council was convened at order of the Emperor. It was held in the east, and the Pope didn?t attend. In fact, because he didn?t attend, and courtesy required that he be informed, a letter was sent to him?[x]\n How is it written? It begins \"The Holy Synod which by the grace of God was assembled at Ephesus the Metropolis to the most holy and our fellow-minister Coelestine, health in the Lord.\" That is, it politely accords great respect to a great bishop, but not to a Papal Prince. In fact, even a person who is a heretic, is accorded title \"?The most reverend John bishop of Antioch?\"\n And in dealing with heretics, it calls upon the Pope not to act with princely authority, but to keep them in mind, to pray for them. It also says \"?and in accordance with the orders of the most pious and Christ-loving Emperors, we assembled together?\", confirming that the council was brought about at the behest of the Emperor, not the Pope.\n Ironically, this council's decrees which are supposed to back up Papal claims had issued a decree stating that the Creed of Nicea should never be changed? something Catholics would later do.[xi]\n Note it gives no scope for a Papal decision to change the Creed. It states 'no bishop'. One of the most blatant re-workings of the truth can be found on a Catholic web-site which quotes?\n \"[Pope] Stephen ... boasts of the place of his episcopate, and contends that he holds the succession from Peter, on whom the foundations of the Church were laid [Matt. 16:18]. ... Stephen ... announces that he holds by succession the throne of Peter\" (collected in Cyprian?s Letters 74[75]:17 [A.D. 253]).\"[xii]\n The actual text says? \"17. And in this respect I am justly indignant at this so open and manifest folly of Stephen, that he who so boasts of the place of his episcopate, and contends that he holds the succession from Peter, on whom the foundations of the Church were laid, should introduce many other rocks and establish new buildings of many churches; maintaining that there is baptism in them by his authority. For they who are baptized, doubtless, fill up the number of the Church. But he who approves their baptism maintains, of those baptized, that the Church is also with them. Nor does he understand that the truth of the Christian Rock is overshadowed, and in some measure abolished, by him when he thus betrays and deserts unity.\"[xiii]\n That is, Cyprian is critical of the Bishop of Rome for unilaterally adding to teachings. A most interesting footnote appears to this text?\n \"[This place and succession are conceded in the argument; but Stephen himself does not appear to have claimed to be the Rock or to exercise the authority of Peter. Vol. iii. p. 266 ]\"[xiv]\n Another Catholic claim centres around the Council of Chalcedon\n \"Bishop Paschasinus, guardian of the Apostolic See, stood in the midst [of the Council Fathers] and said, 'We received directions at the hands of the most blessed and apostolic bishop of the Roman city [Pope Leo I], who is the head of all the churches, which directions say that Dioscorus is not to be allowed to sit in the [present] assembly, but that if he should attempt to take his seat, he is to be cast out. This instruction we must carry out\" (Acts of the Council, session 1 [A.D. 451]). [xv]\n How is this possible? Canon XXVIII shows up claims for papal power?\n \"FOLLOWING in all things the decisions of the holy Fathers, and acknowledging the canon, which has been just read, of the One Hundred and Fifty Bishops beloved-of-God (who assembled in the imperial city of Constantinople, which is New Rome, in the time of the Emperor Theodosius of happy memory), we also do enact and decree the same things concerning the privileges of the most holy Church of Constantinople, which is New Rome. For the Fathers rightly granted privileges to the throne of old Rome, because it was the royal city. And the One Hundred and Fifty most religious Bishops, actuated by the same consideration, gave equal privileges (greek... isa presbeia) to the most holy throne of New Rome, justly judging that the city which is honoured with the Sovereignty and the Senate, and enjoys equal privileges with the old imperial Rome, should in ecclesiastical matters also be magnified as she is, and rank next after her; so that, in the Pontic, the Asian, and the Thracian dioceses, the metropolitans only and such bishops also of the Dioceses aforesaid as are among the barbarians, should be ordained by the aforesaid most holy throne of the most holy Church of Constantinople; every metropolitan of the aforesaid dioceses, together with the bishops of his province, ordaining his own provincial bishops, as has been declared by the divine canons; but that, as has been above said, the metropolitans of the aforesaid Dioceses should be ordained by the archbishop of Constantinople, after the proper elections have been held according to custom and have been reported to him.\" [xvi]\n That is, a council decided what honours should be attained by a particular bishopric, and they decided Constantinople, which was then as important a city as Rome, should receive THE SAME HONOURS as Rome.\n The Catholic claim continues?\n \"After the reading of the foregoing epistle [The Tome of Leo], the most reverend bishops cried out: 'This is the faith of the fathers! This is the faith of the apostles! So we all believe! Thus the orthodox believe! Anathema to him who does not thus believe! Peter has spoken thus through Leo!\" (ibid., session 2).[xvii]\n This same Leo, it must be remembered, begged the Emperor to have the council meet in Italy, but the Emperor ignored him?\n \"And because this mystery is now being impiously opposed by a few ignorant persons, all the churches of our parts, and all the priests entreat your clemency, with groans and tears seeing that our delegates faithfully protested, and bishop Flavian gave them an appeal in writing, to order a general synod to be held in Italy, which shall either dismiss or appease all disputes in such a way that there be nothing any longer either doubtful in the Faith or divided in love, and to it, of course, the bishops of the Eastern provinces must come, and if any of them were overcome by threats and injury, and deviated from the path of truth, they may be fully restored by health-giving measures, and they themselves, whose case is harder, if they acquiesce in wiser counsels, may not fall from the unity of the Church.\" Letter XLIV. To Theodosius Augustus.[xviii]\n But what about the actual text as put forward by the Catholics? Well let?s look at the text and how it reads in context ?After reading of the forgoing epistle (Pope Leo's), the most reverend bishops cried out: \"This is the faith of the fathers, this is the faith of the Apostles. So we all believe, thus the orthodox believe. Anathema to him who does not thus believe. Peter has spoken thus through Leo. So taught the Apostles. Piously and truly did Leo teach, so taught Cyril. Everlasting be the memory of Cyril. Leo and Cyril taught the same thing, anathema to him who does not so believe. This is the true faith. Those of us who are orthodox thus believe.\" (quoted in Two Paths, p64).\n That is, they welcome the teachings of Leo, because they are the truth, as are the teachings of Cyril. They are not saying 'these are the teachings of our leader', otherwise they wouldn?t have put Cyril on the same footing as Leo.\n Ironically, in light of the history of Papal parsimony, canon II states? \"IF any Bishop should ordain for money, and put to sale a grace which cannot be sold, and for money ordain a bishop, or chorepiscopus, or presbyters, or deacons, or any other of those who are counted among the clergy; or if through lust of gain he should nominate for money a steward, or advocate, or prosmonarius, or any one whatever who is on the roll of the Church, let him who is convicted of this forfeit his own rank; and let him who is ordained be nothing profited by the purchased ordination or promotion; but let him be removed from the dignity or charge he has obtained for money. And if any one should be found negotiating such shameful and unlawful transactions, let him also, if he is a clergyman, be deposed from his rank, and if he is a layman or monk, let him be anathematized.\"[xix]\n One man who converted from Protestantism to Catholicism claimed that there is ample evidence of the early church fathers supporting Papal supremecy.[xx]\n He states with convictions?\n \"Tertullian, in his Demurrer Against the Heritics, written about the year A.D. 200, and continuing to challenge the heretics who have departed from the doctrine of the Church says, \"Come now,...run through the apostolic Churches in which the very thrones of the Apostles remain still in place...Achaia...Corinth...Philippi...Ephesus. But if you are near to Italy, you have Rome, whence also our authority derives. How happy is that Church, on which the Apostles poured out their whole doctrine along with their blood, where Peter endured a passion like that of the Lord, where Paul was crowned in a death like John's [John the Baptist], where the Apostle John, after being immersed in boiling oil and suffered no hurt, was exiled to an island\"[36,1-3]. (p.122).\"\n Oddly enough he fails to understand that he highlights the part that doesn't support his argument. If you are near to Italy, Rome is your head church? that is to say, only if you are near Italy. But what about ?whence also our authority derives'?\n Let's just take a moment to look at Tertullian, is he a whole-hearted supporter of the Papacy?\n A Catholic web-site[xxi] states?\n \"Tertullian (QUINTUS SEPTIMIUS FLORENS TERTULLIANUS). \n Ecclesiastical writer in the second and third centuries, b. probably about 160 at Carthage, being the son of a centurion in the proconsular service. He was evidently by profession an advocate in the law-courts, and he shows a close acquaintance with the procedure and terms of Roman law, though it is doubtful whether he is to be identified with a jurist Tertullian who is cited in the Pandects. He knew Greek as well as Latin, and wrote works in Greek which have not come down to us. A pagan until middle life, he had shared the pagan prejudices against Christianity, and had indulged like others in shameful pleasures. His conversion was not later than the year 197, and may have been earlier. He embraced the Faith with all the ardour of his impetuous nature. He became a priest, no doubt of the Church of Carthage. Monceaux, followed by d'Ales, considers that his earlier writings were composed while he was yet a layman, and if this be so, then his ordination was about 200. His extant writings range in date from the apologetics of 197 to the attack on a bishop who is probably Pope Callistus (after 218).\"\n Note two things. 1) he is from North Africa; close to Italy ? therefore his church then probably did come under the headship of Rome. 2) He was known to be critical of bishops of Rome.\n This mis-guided writer goes on. Another of his so-called proofs is the opening address of St. Ignatius of Antioch to the Romans, which reads;\n \"Ignatius, who is also Theophorus, unto her that hath found mercy in the bountifulness of the Father Most High and of Jesus Christ His only Son; to the church that is beloved and enlightened through the will of Him who willed all things that are, by faith and love towards Jesus Christ our God; even unto her that hath the presidency in the country of the region of the Romans, being worthy of God, worthy of honour, worthy of felicitation, worthy of praise, worthy of success, worthy in purity, and having the presidency of love, walking in the law of Christ and bearing the Father's name; which church also I salute in the name of Jesus Christ the Son of the Father; unto them that in flesh and spirit are united unto His every commandment, being filled with the grace of God without wavering, and filtered clear from every foreign stain; abundant greeting in Jesus Christ our God in blamelessness.\"[xxii]\n Again note? 'to the presidency in the country of the region of the Romans', that is, to the area around Rome! Note also 'to the church that is beloved?' not 'to the church that is MOST beloved?'\n The quote by Irenaeus of Lyons has this interesting footnote?\n The Latin text of this difficult but important clause is, \"Ad hanc enim ecclesiam propter potiorem principalitatem necesse est omnem convenire ecclesiam.\" Both the text and meaning have here given rise to much discussion. It is impossible to say with certainty of what words in the Greek original \"potiorem principalitatem\" may be the translation. We are far from sure that the rendering given above is correct, but we have been unable to think of anything better. [A most extraordinary confession. It would be hard to find a worse; but take the following from a candid Roman Catholic, which is better and more literal: \"For to this Church, on account of more potent principality, it is necessary that every Church (that is, those who are on every side faithful) resort; in which Church ever, by those who are on every side, has been preserved that tradition which is from the apostles.\" (Berington and Kirk, vol. i. p. 252.) Here it is obvious that the faith was kept at Rome, by those who resort there from all quarters. She was a mirror of the Catholic World, owing here orthodoxy to them; not the Sun, dispensing her own light to others, but the glass bringing their rays into a focus. See note at end of book iii.] A discussion of the subject may be seen in chap. xii. of Dr. Wordsworth's St. Hippolytus and the Church of Rome.[xxiii]\n Lastly, Irenaeus of Lyons says of Rome?\n \"The blessed apostles, then, having founded and built up the Church, committed into the hands of Linus the office of the episcopate\"\n That is, it was founded by Peter and Paul. Further,\n \"4. But Polycarp also was not only instructed by apostles, and conversed with many who had seen Christ, but was also, by apostles in Asia, appointed bishop of the Church in Smyrna, whom I also saw in my early youth, for he tarried [on earth] a very long time, and, when a very old man, gloriously and most nobly suffering martyrdom,7 departed this life, having always taught the things which he had learned from the apostles, and which the Church has handed down, and which alone are true. To these things all the Asiatic Churches testify, as do also those men who have succeeded Polycarp down to the present time,-a man who was of much greater weight, and a more stedfast witness of truth, than Valentinus, and Marcion, and the rest of the heretics. He it was who, coming to Rome in the time of Anicetus caused many to turn away from the aforesaid heretics to the Church of God, proclaiming that he had received this one and sole truth from the apostles,-that, namely, which is handed down by the Church.8 There are also those who heard from him that John, the disciple of the Lord, going to bathe at Ephesus, and perceiving Cerinthus within, rushed out of the bath-house without bathing, exclaiming, \"Let us fly, lest even the bath-house fall down, because Cerinthus, the enemy of the truth, is within.\" And Polycarp himself replied to Marcion, who met him on one occasion, and said, \"Dost thou know me? \"\"I do know thee, the first-born of Satan.\" Such was the horror which the apostles and their disciples had against holding even verbal communication with any corrupters of the truth; as Paul also says, \"A man that is an heretic, after the first and second admonition, reject; knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.\"9 There is also a very powerful10 Epistle of Polycarp written to the Philippians, from which those who choose to do so, and are anxious about their salvation, can learn the character of his faith, and the preaching of the truth. Then, again, the Church in Ephesus, founded by Paul, and having John remaining among them permanently until the times of Trajan, is a true witness of the tradition of the apostles.\"[xxiv]\n That is, Polycarp, of Asia, also holds Apostolic authority, and his church too bears witness to Christianity.\n ENDNOTES\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n [i] http://www.catholic.com/library/eastern_orthodoxy.asp\n [ii] http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&passage=luke+22&version=NIV\n [iii] Whelton, p32.\n [iv] http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-10/anf10-48.htm\n [v] Whelton, p33.\n [vi] http://members.aol.com/DSeraphim/1.html\n [vii] http://www.ccel.org/fathers/NPNF2-14/3Const1/Canon2.htm\n [viii] http://www.catholic.com/library/Authority_of_the_Pope_Part_2.asp\n [ix] http://www.ccel.org/fathers/NPNF2-14/4Ephesus/Canons.htm\n [x] http://www.monachos.net/patristics/christology/ephesus_to_celestine.shtml\n [xi] http://www.monachos.net/patristics/christology/ephesus_on_nicea.shtml\n [xii] http://www.catholic.com/library/Authority_of_the_Pope_Part_1.asp\n [xiii] http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-05/anf05-99.htm#P6387_2042966\n [xiv] http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-05/footnote/fn64.htm#P6438_2069301\n [xv] http://www.catholic.com/library/Authority_of_the_Pope_Part_2.asp\n [xvi] http://www.ccel.org/fathers/NPNF2-14/4chalcedon/canons.htm\n [xvii] http://www.catholic.com/library/Authority_of_the_Pope_Part_2.asp\n [xviii] http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-12/Npnf2-12-49.htm#P1334_326773)\n [xix] http://www.ccel.org/fathers/NPNF2-14/4chalcedon/canons.htm\n [xx] http://www.saveourchurch.org/faithfather.html\n [xxi] http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14520c.htm\n [xxii] http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/ignatius-romans-lightfoot.html\n [xxiii] http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-01/footnote/fn73.htm#P7320_1946616\n [xxiv] http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/irenaeus-book3.html",

   "Thank you, I apologise only for the length of it (and for the ?'s that appear instead of quote marks)\n \n It started as two documents, one a list of points made by reading Whelton, M, (1998), \"Two Paths Papal Monarchy Collegial Tradition\", and the other from a number of Catholic sites that show 'alleged support for the Papacy (referenced to me by well-meaning Catholic friends). I have the 'list' of references if anyone wants to see them posted. I had problems with some of the documents they cite, not least because I couldn't find them referenced to full text sites anywhere on the net. Some I did find, and found that they were taken out of context. Actually forget contacting me, you can find the list at...\n http://www.kensmen.com/catholic/easternfathers.html\n or\n http://www.globalserve.net/~bumblebee/ecclesia/patriarchs.htm\n or\n http://www.catholicapologetics.net/apolo_79.htm\n or\n http://www.christianideas.org/srnewman1.htm\n \n Take for instance their quote\n \"St. Nilus of Constantinople (448) \n A disciple of St. John Chrysostom \n Peter, Head of the choir of Apostles. (Nilus, Lib. ii Epistl.) \n Peter, who was foremost in the choir of Apostles and always ruled amongst them. (Nilus, Tract. ad. Magnam.)\"\n There is nothing in this to say that the successor of St.Peter in Rome should be regarded as the head of the church. St. Peter founded many bishoprics, including Antioch - I am Antiochian Orthodox, and he founded ours FIRST!\n Their quotes can be categorised thus\n a) general comments on the power of St. Peter (which as just noted, does not equate to Roman supremacy)\n b) quotes I can not check from a reliable source\n c) quotes I can check and oft find them taken out of context thus making me exclude quotes in category b) (or at least treat them warily). I don't mean to be unkind, but the re-working of their quotes on several occasions makes me doubt the ones I can't independently verify. As Whelton points out in regards the \"Donation of Constantine\" which was a well-known forgery, if the Papacy's claims to power were so sure, why would they need to make use of such documents?\n I reply to some of these sites...(this is the formation of, or nucleus of the argument given in the first 3 posts and thus might be more digestible).\n I forget which site I replied to on this occasion, but below is a typical exchange... (I include this here also because it deals with some documents not already dealt with)\n \n Sir,\n I am amazed at the lack of critical thinking that was shown in posting these quotes. Many clearly don't support the case of Papal Primacy. For instance...\n Theodoret, Bishop of Cyrus in Syria (450): \n A native of Antioch, Theodoret ruled under the Antiochean Patriarch.\n The great foundation of the Church was shaken, and confirmed by the Divine grace. And the Lord commanded him to apply that same care to the brethren. 'And thou,' He says, 'converted, confirm thy brethren.' (Theodoret, Tom. iv. Haeret. Fab. lib. v.c. 28)\n Is taken so much out of context that it has no mention of St. Peter, or of Rome, or anything, and is thus bereft of meaning for the purposes of your argument.\n Another quote...\n St. Athanasius (362 A.D.): \n Rome is called the Apostolic throne. (Athanasius, Hist. Arian, ad Monach. n. 35).\n This doesn't support your case, because many 'thrones' were Apostolic. Antioch was founded by St. Peter too, and was in fact founded before the Roman See, thus it can claim the same 'Apostolic' status. Where does it say that St. Peter, as the head of the Apostles should be succeeded by a ruler, in only one of the bishoprics that he founded - in particular, Rome? Thus, even when you can show that St. Peter did lead the Apostles, you need to draw a connection between this and the bishops of only one particular see that he founded.\n Likewise, another (mis)quote of yours...\n St. Cyril of Alexandria (c. 424): \n He suffers him no longer to be called Simon, exercising authority and rule over him already having become His own. By a title suitable to the thing, He changed his name into Peter, from the word 'petra' (rock); for on him He was afterwards to found His Church. (Cyril, T. iv. Comm. in Joan., p. 131)\n The very basis for claims of Papal Authority stem from the New Testament passage: \"Thou art Peter; and on this rock I will build My church and I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven.\" (Mat 16:18-19).\n But, how did the early church view this passage? Is the Catholic claim so clear-cut? A survey of early church fathers commentaries 1 shows seventeen Fathers thought of the rock as Peter, forty-four thought it referred to Peter's confession of faith, sixteen thought Christ himself was the rock, while eight thought that the rock meant all of the Apostles. Thus 80% of these Church Fathers did not recognise ?the rock? as meaning Peter alone. Such a claim of Catholic commission therefore is not so clear.\n St. Augustine of Hippo wrote 2 \"See what praises follow this faith. \"Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build this Church\" What meaneth, \"Upon this rock I will build My Church\"\n Upon this faith; upon this that has been said, \"Thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God. Upon this rock,\" saith He, \"I will build My Church.\"\n St. Cyprian stated 3 \"Faith is the foundation of the Church, for it was not of the person but of the faith of St. Peter that it was said that the gates of hell should not prevail against it; it sis the confession of faith that has vanquished hell. Jesus Christ is the Rock. He did not deny the grace of His name when He called him Peter, because he borrowed from the rock the constancy and solidity of his faith. Endeavour then, thyself to be a rock ? thy rock is thy faith, and faith is the foundation of the Church. If thou art a rock, thou shalt be in the Church for the Church is built upon the rock\"?\n Thus, St. Cyprian, the very bloke you quote understands that it is the faith as declared by St. Peter to be the basis for the church. Not the person of St. Peter.\n Turning again to St. Augustine 4 \"Therefore Peter is so called from the rock; not the rock from Peter; as Christ is not called Christ from the Christian, but the Christian from Christ. \" Therefore, \"He saith, \"Thou art Peter; and upon this Rock\" which thou hast confessed, upon this Rock which thou hast acknowledged saying, \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God, will I build My Church:\" that is upon Myself, the Son of the living God, \"will I build My Church.\" I will build thee upon Myself, not Myself upon thee. For men who wish to be built upon men, said, ?I am of Paul: and I of Appollos; and I of Cephas,\" (1 Cor. 1:12) who is Peter, but upon the Rock, said \"But I am of Christ.\n And when the Apostle Paul ascertained that he was chose, and Christ despised, he said, \"Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?\" (1 Cor. 1:13) And, as not in the name of Paul, so neither in the name of Peter; but in the name of Christ: that Peter might be built upon the Rock, not the Rock upon Peter.?\n Your quote...\n Eulogius of Alexandria (581 A.D.):\n Neither to John, nor to any other of the disciples, did our Saviour say, 'I will give to thee the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven,' but only to Peter. (Eulogius, Lib. ii. Cont. Novatian. ap. Photium, Biblioth, cod. 280)\n Doesn't add that further to this, the power of binding and loosing is given to all the Apostles (Mat 18:18). Thus to turn to St. Augustine once more 5 ?He had not the primacy over the disciples (in discipulos) but among the disciples (in disipulis). His primacy among the disciples was the same as that of Stephen among the deacons?\n Other 'sources' you quote, I can't check. I try the meta search-engine Ithaki.net I type \"Sergius, Metropolitain of Cyprus\" in the search-engine only reveals your own web-site (and other sites mirroring the same set of quotes). However, I would be safe to assume that you liberally misquote them as well.\n One of the worst quotes you use is St. Sophronius, Patriarch of Jerusalem (c. 638): \n Teaching us all orthodoxy and destroying all heresy and driving it away from the God-protected halls of our holy Catholic Church. And together with these inspired syllables and characters, I accept all his (the pope's) letters and teachings as proceeding from the mouth of Peter the Coryphaeus, and I kiss them and salute them and embrace them with all my soul ... I recognize the latter as definitions of Peter and the former as those of Mark, and besides, all the heaven-taught teachings of all the chosen mystagogues of our Catholic Church. (Sophronius, Mansi, xi. 461)\n Note that he accepts teachings of St. Peter and St. Mark. He embraces both with 'all his soul', as I do, as we all should - embrace the teachings of all the Apostles. You seem to think that this is proof of only St. Peter's greatness, and I don't see why you would draw such an inference especially when mentioned in context with another Apostle.\n One of the main Catholic 'evidences' comes from the belief that Cyril, Bishop of Alexandria acted as the Pope's (Celestine) servant, in the Nestorian debates. Pope Pius XI claimed that the 3rd Ecumenical Council established papal supremacy.\n But Cyril said...\n \"Peter and John were both Apostles and saints and adorned with equal honours and powers\"6\n The Pretence of Popes goes back a long way, so it is no surprise that it would be based on misquotes and misrepresentations....\n Third Ecumenical Council: Ephesus (431) \n The Council of Ephesus, of more than 200 bishops, presided over by St. Cyril of Alexandria representing Pope Celestine I, defined the true personal unity of Christ, declared Mary the Mother of God (theotokos) against Nestorius, Bishop of Constantinople, and renewed the condemnation of Pelagius.7\n This lie stems from Pius XI's declaration (in Lux Veritatis) that Cyril, Patriarch of Alexandria was a papal legate.\n Pope Celestine never refers to Patriarch Cyril as legate in correspondence to the Council, and only describes Arcadius, Projetus, and Philip as those who \"filled the place of the Apostolic See\"8 The fact that he sent legates at all shows that Cyril did not represent him.\n Three months before the Council had been called, Pope Celestin had issued an excommunication on Nestorius, Patriarch of Constantinople. The Council, however, ignored this and treated Nestorius as the proper Patriarch of Constantinople. The council then proceeded to examine the evidence and pronounced its own sentence: \"The holy Synod...to Nestorius the new Judas: Know that for thy impious doctrines thou was deposed by the holy Synod agreeably to the laws of the Church\"9\n That is, they ignored the excommunication of Celestine and judged him for themselves. Pope Pius XI tried to put a spin on this saying that they merely ratified Celestine's sentence. This is not so, as shown Nestorius was accepted with honour, until the sentence was passed. The Emperor himself had invited Nestorius \"...In November the emperor, not regarding the papal condemnation as definitive, had already convoked a general council...\"10\n Further, Roman Catholic historian Bishop Maret says \"The Pope pronounced in the affair of Nestorius a canonical judgment clothed with all the authority of his see. He had prescribed its execution. Yet, however, three months after this sentence and before its execution, all the episcopate is invited to examine afresh and to decide freely the question in dispute...\"11\n In summary then your bulk of evidences can be whittled away once we remove quotes that don't support your case - through not even mentioning St.Peter or Rome, or to those that simply refer to the status of St. Peter - because there's no link between him being given great honour and those honours being only bestowed upon one particular bishopric that he founded (out of many)... Then there are the quotes you take out of context, specifically those of St. Cyprian, whom I have shown, understood the Bishop of Rome's position differently from what you would have readers believe. Then there are quotes I can't independently check, but going on the record of other quotes, I wouldn't like to bet that they support your case either.\n PS\n Should you ever wish to see how the early church behaved towards St. Peter, start from the Acts of the Apostles... Catholic friends of mine like to point out that when St. Peter spoke, everyone was silent. This is another case of taking things out of context.\n There are a few important things.\n a) James presided, not Peter\n b) When someone spoke, whomever it was, no one else spoke over them. That's called politeness\n Thus...\n \"When they finished, James spoke up:...\"\n That is, James waited his turn.\n Earlier...\n Acts 15:12\n \"The whole assembly became silent as they listened to Barnabas and Paul telling about the miraculous signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them. \"\n They too had the floor, and everyone was silent.\n c) MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL James clearly made the decision\n Acts 15:19\n \"It is my judgment, therefore, that we should not make it difficult for the Gentiles who are turning to God. \n Note also...\n Acts 15:23 \"With them they sent the following letter: The apostles and elders, your brothers, To the Gentile believers in Antioch, Syria and Cilicia: Greetings. \n 24 We have heard that some went out from us without our authorization and disturbed you, troubling your minds by what they said. \n 25 So we all agreed to choose some men and send them to you with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul-- 26 men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ\n That is, 'we' decided this, 'we' voted on this. Not \"Peter\" decided this.\n Thus\n \"But observe how Peter does everything with the common consent; nothing imperiously.\" 12\n \n ENDNOTES\n 1 by Jean de Launoy Epist.

   "OK.... I keep waiting for Maximus to chime in here....\n\n I hold Maximus with the deepest of respect, but I believe he is wrong, on the issue of the Papacy.\n \n It was Leo III who crowned Charlemagne. I have a special interest in Charles the Great as I love the stories/legends surrounding his court - Montalban itself is a name that comes from these fables.\n \n All the first major councils were held in the east, and all were at the behest of the Emperor, not the Pope - one (as stated in my long tract) was called without his notification.\n \n But what gets my goat is the Catholic sites that so blatantly misrepresent early church sources - by misquotes etc. It is the same with the Pope saying that Orthodoxy is the nearest and dearest to Catholics, yet he does so much to undermine us in the former Soviet Union.\n \n It has to be about Papal power for them, because from this all other things come; such as the ruling on the Nicene Creed, un-married priests, the move to make Marya co-redemptress, (or redemptrix). And thus it is not about spritituality, but power. This is why they make exemptions on these 'spiritual' issues, for people who break-away from Orthodoxy and recognise the Pope as leader.\n \n The double standards is evident in the Pope's dealings with all faiths, not just Orthodoxy. Here's another very long article... This is the Pope pretending to like a faith. (also note that this is a Protestant tract, and they go from criticising the Pope's stance on Islam, to pushing sola scriptura junk later on)\n \n The Papacy and Islam\n by Richard Bennett and Robert J. Nicholson\n New Partnership with Muslims\n In his message to the predominately Muslim nation of Kazakhstan twelve days after the horrors of September 11 th , 2001, the Pope declared, \n ??There is one God'. The Apostle proclaims before all else the absolute oneness of God. This is a truth which Christians inherited from the children of Israel and which they share with Muslims: it is faith in the one God, ?Lord of heaven and earth' (Lk.10:21), almighty and merciful. In the name of this one God, I turn to the people of deep and ancient religious traditions, the people of Kazakhstan. ? [1] \n He then gave a false Gospel. Building a ?civilization of love?, he said, is the task of Christians and Muslims . His exact words were, \n ?This ?logic of love' is what he [Jesus] holds out to us, asking us to live it above all through generosity to those in need. It is a logic which can bring together Christians and Muslims, and commit them to work together for the ?civilization of love'. It is a logic which overcomes all the cunning of this world and allows us to make true friends who will welcome us ?into the eternal dwelling-places' (Lk.16:9), into the ?homeland' of heaven.? [2] \n His final prayer was for a partnership between ?Christians and Muslims?. His words were, \n ?And in this celebration we want to pray for Kazakhstan and its inhabitants, so that this vast nation, with all its ethnic, cultural and religious variety, will grow stronger in justice, solidarity and peace. May it progress on the basis in particular of cooperation between Christians and Muslims, committed day by day, side by side, in the effort to fulfil God's will.? [3] \n In spite of the catastrophic events of September 11 th , the Pope has continued faithfully the Roman Catholic Church policy of affirmation and approval of Islam. The Vatican speaks officially of the Roman Catholic Church having the same God and faith of Abraham as the Muslims, \n ? The Church's relationship with the Muslims. ?The plan of salvation also includes those who acknowledge the Creator, in the first place amongst whom are the Muslims; these profess to hold the faith of Abraham, and together with us they adore the one, merciful God, mankind's judge on the last day.'? [4] \n The Roman Catholic Church officially declares that the One God of Holy Scripture is also the God of Islam. It also esteems the moral life of Islam, the affirmation of which follows, \n ?The Church has also a high regard for the Muslims. They worship God, who is one, living and subsistent, merciful and almighty, the Creator of heaven and earth, who has also spoken to men. They strive to submit themselves without reserve to the hidden decrees of God, just as Abraham submitted himself to God's plan, whose faith Muslims eagerly link to their own. Although not acknowledging him as God, they venerate Jesus as a prophet, his virgin Mother they also honor, and even at times devotedly invoke. Further, they await the day of judgment and the reward of God following the resurrection of the dead. For this reason they highly esteem an upright life and worship God, especially by way of prayer, alms-deeds and fasting.? [5] \n It is clear from this official recognition that the Church of Rome's estimation of Islam has experienced a fundamental change. The Biblical commandment not to venerate any strange god has been broken by Rome in order to credit Islam and its adherents with holding to the faith of Abraham. Patently, this novel re-assessment of the Muslim faith represents a major shift in the political policy of the Vatican. These official statements are carefully constructed religious discourse. They are aimed at engendering a new mood of respectful rapprochement and mutual understanding between the Papacy and Islam. As a device of diplomatic exchange, they show clearly that a new interfaith-ecumenicity is being propounded by Rome with the singular objective of embracing Islam and its peoples within a new international community of religious life and faith, a community incidentally, in which Rome enjoys priority as founder and senior partner. \n Islam rejects Trinity, Christ's divinity, His sacrifice \n Christians believe in One God, in which One Godhead there exists Three Persons. Islam rejects this concept as blasphemous. The Qur'an declares, \n ?Certainly they disbelieve who say: Surely Allah is the third (person) of the three; and there is no god but the one God, and if they desist not from what they say, a painful chastisement shall befall those among them who disbelieve?(Surah 5:73) [6] . \n The Bible proclaims Christ' s sacrificial death on the cross in place of the believer, \"In Whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace. ? [7] Islam passionately rejects the crucifixion of Christ Jesus . Thus the Qur'an declares, \n ?And their saying: Surely we have killed the Messiah, Isa son of Marium, the apostle of Allah; and they did not kill him nor did they crucify him, but it appeared to them so (like Isa) and most surely those who differ therein are only in a doubt about it; they have no knowledge respecting it, but only follow a conjecture, and they killed him not for sure? (Surah 4:157). \n The Bible proclaims Christ Jesus as divine, being the brightness of the divine glory, and the express image of God. In the Qur'an Christ Jesus is debased to being solely an apostle of Allah. Thus the Qur'an states, ?O followers of the Book! do not exceed the limits in your religion, and do not speak (lies) against Allah, but (speak) the truth; the Messiah, Isa son of Marium is only an apostle of Allah?? (Surah 4.171) Christ Jesus declared, ?Before Abraham was, I am .? [8] ? I and my Father are one.? [9] ?I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.? [10] A religion that rejects Christ's d ivinity is dead in its sins. It is an absurd blasphemy that the Pope declares that the one, living and subsistent God of the Bible is the same one as the infidel god of Islam.\n The Gospel and the Qur'an's religious philosophy \n In the Bible the Gospel is as the Apostle John declared, ?This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.? [11] ?And this is life eternal, that they might know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent.? [12] The whole purpose of the God of Scripture is clearly seen in the reason why the Gospel of John was written, ? These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.? This is totally different from the god of Islam who orders fighting, war, and punishment, by murder, crucifixion and amputation. The following is just a sample of the primary concept of fighting for Allah that the Qur'an requires: \n \"And kill them wherever you find them, and drive them out from whence they drove you out, and persecution is severer than slaughter, and do not fight with them at the Sacred Mosque until they fight with you in it, but if they do fight you, then slay them; such is the recompense of the unbelievers.? Surah 2.191 \n \"And fight with them until there is no persecution, and religion should be only for Allah, but if they desist, then there should be no hostility except against the oppressors.\" Surah 2.193 \n \"?let those fight in the way of Allah, who sell this world's life for the hereafter; and whoever fights in the way of Allah, then be he slain or be he victorious, We shall grant him a mighty reward.\" Surah 4.74 \n \"The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His apostle and strive to make mischief in the land is only this, that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides or they should be imprisoned; this shall be as a disgrace for them in this world, and in the hereafter they shall have a grievous chastisement,\" Surah 5.33 \n \"Those who believe fight in the way of Allah,?\" Surah 8.39 \n The commandment of the Lord is as different as darkness and light, for He says , \"Love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil. Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.\" [13] While many individual Muslims may deplore atrocities committed in the name of Islam, it cannot be denied that these atrocities are justified and encouraged by Islamic teaching. Even the most moderate form of Islam is incompatible with Biblical truth.\n Roman Catholic dogma on Islam changed \n Nonetheless, after six centuries of condemning of Islam and two centuries of Crusades against the Muslims, modern Roman Catholicism is welcoming and affirming the religion of Mohammed. Rome now accepts Islam as having the same faith of Abraham as herself. How can the Roman Catholic Church espouse a religion that utterly rejects the Trinity, the divinity of the Lord Jesus Christ and His Gospel? Clearly, the Roman Catholic Church still plays the adaptable chameleon 3/4 for since Vatican Council II, she has in Muslim circles embraced Islam to the extent that she calls praiseworthy that which she once had denounced as evil and the object of war. \n In 1095, Pope Urban II called for a \"War of the Cross,\" or a Crusade, to retake the holy lands from the infidel Muslim Turks. Several versions of his speech at the end of a Church Council have survived. Although we cannot be sure of the exact words the Pope used, the substance however is the same. The heart and mind of papal power in twelfth and thirteenth centuries is seen in these sentences, \"All who die by the way, whether by land or by sea, or in battle against the pagans, shall have immediate remission of sins. This I grant them through the power of God with which I am invested.\" [14]\n (please note the Pope was basing this on his own power - not the Bible - Montalban)\n The present Pope and his Church uphold the teaching that the definitions of all Roman Pontiffs pertaining to faith or morals of the Roman Pontiff are ?irreformable by their very nature.? [15] If the present Roman Pontiff, John Paul II, has proclaimed Muslims to be acceptable as believers, then by that same proclamation, Urban II and the whole line of Crusading Popes have been proven to be damnable heretics, since they condemned Muslims and fought against them! \n Emotional unity and its consequences\n The ecumenism of the Papacy with Islam is of grave concern for the true body of Christ to consider. The Sovereign Pontiff John Paul II sees himself as the one capable of bringing in a New World Order, in which Rome will be the Mother and Lawmaker. Through his Vatican II documents the Pope declares, \"The encouragement of unity is in harmony with the deepest nature of the [Roman Catholic] Church's mission?.\" [16] On an highly emotional spiritual level there has been a great common-ground meeting place between Rome and Mecca in the town of Fatima in Portugal. To quote a Catholic news organization, \"Our Lady of Fatima is really Fatima, daughter of the Prophet Mohammed?On October 23, 1995, Iranian television began running stories that the apparitions in Fatima, Portugal in 1917 were religious phenomena of Muslim origin.\" [17] Islam teaches that men can achieve favor with God by what a person does. On the Fatima site in Portugal May 13 th 2000, the Pope proclaimed a message that could be readily accepted by both Muslims and Catholics. \"Pray, pray much and make sacrifices for sinners; many souls go to hell because they have no one to pray and make sacrifices for them' ... .\" [18] Heroic deeds to win the approval of God appeal to the natural man, including the devout Muslim; it is, however, light years away from the Gospel of grace. The Pope's message, and the message and veneration of heroism in Islam are a total negation of the Gospel, \"not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us....\" [19] In practice both systems 3/4 a mammoth one billion adherents each 3/4 are totalitarian, synthesizing spiritual and civil power in their doctrinal presentations and cultic practices. The global hierarchy and infrastructure of the RCC, however, is far more developed than that of Islam. [20] The bringing together of both under the Roman Pontiff, who calls himself the Vicar of Christ, would make for a political powerhouse of vast consequences.\n \n top\n \n Pope's message echoed Muslim Leaders \n \n The drawing of governments and religions even more closely into a global coalition before a politically constructed god has already begun. Rome has many times show n herself as the one to whom all can come for unity within her. Islam as such is still accepted as a valid religion, and the terrorists of September understood to be fallen from their religion, rather than upholding its teachings. The Muslims themselves are giving the same message. For example, the Associated Press reported, \n \n ?An international Muslim religious ruling endorsed the morality of the U.S.-led military effort against terrorists?The ruling?was written by Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi, the widely respected chairman of the Sunna and Sira Council in Qatar, along with three colleagues in Egypt and one in Syria. The new fatwa cited the words of God in the Quran and authoritative Hadith??All Muslims ought to be united against all those who terrorize the innocents, and those who permit the killing of non-combatants without a justifiable reason,' the fatwa said?The five jurists also said Muslims have a duty to speak up about the faith's anti-terrorism stand.? [21] \n \n This spin on Islam is perfectly in line with what Pope and the Vatican declared, ?together with us they adore the one, merciful God, mankind's judge on the last day.? [22] It looks as if the Pope, the politicians, and the Muslims continue to conceal successfully the history of Mohammed and the contents of his Qur'an.\n \n top\n \n A Trumpet Call to the True Church \n \n The Pope's profession of a ?civilization of love' in his rapprochement with Islam represents only another tactical re-appraisal of circumstances and opportunities for Rome. It is merely the old idol of humanistic sentiment religiously recycled and held out to the world as the cohesive force that will unite all sincere religious people in a concordat of international condemnation against the kind of anti-social fanaticism that led to the September 11th horror. The profound danger for Evangelical people is that they, unthinking, might come to embrace Rome's claim to be the true spokesman for Christ on this earth, a lie which is deeply embedded in this new thrust for inter-faith ecumenicity. The Pope is not a first among equals as a bishop. Frankly, he is not even a bishop in the biblical sense of the term. Karol Wojtyla is the head of a totalitarian hierarchy. Its position as the restored Holy Roman Empire is depicted in the Bible. He is an absolute monarch. He has his own secular government of Vatican City and more property worldwide than any other person on the planet. He has territorial dominions, cardinals, ambassadors worldwide, a detective force, legislature, jurisprudence, laws, advocates, taxes, banks, foreign treaties, ambitious plans and policy, more than any other secular Prince. But he differs from other secular leaders: his spiritual commerce goes hand in hand with his civil power, claiming infallibility and international recognition. The Pope in his own laws declares, ?There is neither appeal nor recourse against a decision or decree of the Roman Pontiff.? His arrogance is not just in spiritual matters, but in secular affairs also, for he claims supreme power as much as any totalitarian ruler, \"The First See is judged by no one. [23] \"It is solely the right of the Roman Pontiff himself o judge?those who hold the highest civil office in a state...\" [24] This Pope desires partnership with Islam. His claims echo II Thessalonians 2:4, ?W ho opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God ? and Isaiah 14:14, \"I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like most High. ? Had not Holy Scripture warned us of this we would rightly be afraid. The Sovereign God remains sovereign . His purposes may be the purification of the Bride of Christ Jesus, the remnant pilgrim Church on earth. The Lord Jesus Christ did not elect the Pope as His Vicar on earth; rather He and the Father gave to the Holy Spirit of Truth to that position. \n If contemporary Evangelical leaders and their disciples discount and ignore these utterly basic prophetic and historical facts, they must understand they are placing themselves outside the stream of historic biblical Christianity. They are willingly divorcing themselves from great men of the faith 3/4 Wycliff, Huss, Luther, Tyndale, Calvin, Cranmer, Latimer, Ridley, Bradford, Foxe, Bunyan, Newton, Edwards, Whitefield, Wesley, Spurgeon, Ryle, and Lloyd-Jones to mention just a few. It is impossible to hold to the Gospel of Christ and simultaneously accord any legitimacy to the accommodations of the papal system. The Lord of Glory Himself will not allow such behavior to go unpunished. If Evangelicals to continue to fraternize with Rome, it will mark a major, irrevocable betrayal of the Gospel testimony toward the poor deluded adherents of Romanism and leave them languishing in the claws of the devil. In other words, in simple terms of loyalty to the Lord Jesus Christ, those claiming to be believers must ? Come out of her?that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.? [25] There is no common ground between the religion of apostasy and the Gospel of the Apostles. In spite of papal declarations of a truce and vacuous \"Evangelical\" alliances with the enemies of Christ, \"Enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed,\" Genesis 3:1, is an epitomized history of conflict which, from the moment of the Fall, has been waged between the children of light and of darkness, between those who adhere to the Gospel of grace and God's righteousness, and those who are ranged on the side of the Devil by their love of accommodation and compromise. At this moment of history the Ecumenism of accommodation, with the Pope leading the pack, accepts Islam as a great religion. The true believer must decide where he or she stands.\"And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve.\" [26] \u00a8 \n Permission is given by the authors to copy this article if it is done in its entirety without any changes. \n Permission is given is also give to publish it in its entirety on the Internet \n WebPages of authors: www.bereanbeacon.org \n http://www.users.bigpond.com/farel/index.html \n http://members.optusnet.com.au/~farelpinel/\n \n Endnotes:\n [1] Homily of the Pope, in Astana, Kazakhstan, on Sunday, 23 September 2001.
