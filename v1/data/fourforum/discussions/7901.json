Its a shame the article didn't discuss the structure of the ribs as well.\n \n But then the article talks about the beastie having fins so it must be less derived then Ichthyostega....

Barbara Forrest's testimony, for one, was an excellent counter to that claim.\n \n \n \n PS: While I'm at it, might as well post some quotes I collected about the 'fishapod' here too (I already posted them in the Religion forum in a thread where someon \"refuted\" evolution).\n \n \nScientists have discovered fossils of a 375-million-year-old fish, a large scaly creature not seen before, that they say is a long-sought missing link in the evolution of some fishes from water to a life walking on four limbs on land. \n \n ...\n \n The skeletons have the fins, scales, and other attributes of a giant fish, four to nine feet long. But on closer examination. the scientists found telling anatomical traits of a transitional creature, a fish that is still a fish but has changes that anticipate the emergence of land animals - and is thus a predecessor of amphibians, reptiles and dinosaurs, mammals, and eventually humans.\n \n In the fishes' forward fins, the scientists found evidence of limbs in the making. There are the beginnings of digits, proto-wrists, elbows, and shoulders. The fish also had a flat skull resembling a crocodile's, a neck, ribs, and other parts that were similar to four-legged land animals knows as tetrapods.\n (Fossil Called a Missing Link from Sea to Land Animals, John Noble Wilford, Apr 06 2006, The New York Times)\n \n\n \n \n \n \n[The 'fishapod'] had the scales, teeth, and gills of a fish, but also a big, curved rib cage that suggests the creature had lungs as well. The ribs interlock, moreover, unlike a fish's, implying they were able to bear fishapod's weight - an unnecessary trait in a fish. It had a neck - most unfishlike. And, most surprising of all, its pectoral fins included bones that look like nothing less than a primitive wrist and fingers.\n (A Fish with Fingers?, Michael Lemonick, Time: Science and Health, Apr 05 2006)\n \n\n \n \n \n \nEspecially significant is the anatomy of Tiktaalik's [the 'fishapod'] pectoral fin, which contains the makings of a proper tetrapod arm. Thanks to the spectacular three-dimensional preservation of the bones - many of which were found still articulated - and the discovery of multiple specimens, the researchers were able to estimate the range of motion of the fin bones. \"Most of the major joints of the fin are functional in this fish,\" Shubin notes. \"The shoulder, elbow, and even parts of the wrist are already there and working in ways similar to the earliest land-living animals.\" \n (Newfound Fossil is Transitional between Fish and Landlubbers, Apr 06 2006, Scientific American, www.scientificamerican.com)\n \n\n \n \n \n \nThe newly found animal has a structure on its head that looks like a small gill slit that is on its way to becoming an ear, for example, and a long snout that would have been suited to catching prey on land.\n (The Fish that Crawled out of the Water, Rex Dalton, Nature (published online), Apr 5 2006\n http://www.nature.com/news/2006/060403/full/060403-7.html)\n \n",

The time window for the expected transitional form is about ~20 ma, a narrow window by geological timeframes. Given this the researchers examined the stratigraphic column to select locatities where the rocks were of the corresponding age and selected sites accordingly.\n \n 2. Tiktaalik was expected to live in a certain type of environment, and this expectation was used to further narrow the localities that would be explored as potential deposits for containing the expected \"transitional\" form.\n \n 3. Having selected the locality, expeditions were mounted and successfully recovered remains of the anticipated beastie. Upon analysis it was found to lie in terms of evolutionary development between the most derived/advanced fish and most primitive tetrapods that had been previously known.\n \n Given the huge expanse of the Earth's surface 1 and 2 helped the researchers select comparitively tiny areas to examine and the fact they found what they (roughly) expected to find says their hypothesis (we will find remains of transitional form x at locality y) was borne out. If no remains had been found then further expeditions might have been successful and the hypothesis could of been validiated at a later date. If they had found, lets say a more primitive form than the previously most advanced fish or a more advanced tetrapod than the previously most primitive form then I think that might amount to a falsifiaction.\n \n Having said all that I think that to claim a hypothesis was validated in this instance is slightly confusing as palaeontology is like archeology- you can never be 100% sure everthing has been found and one small discovery can force a rethink of what that had been established up to that point. Also, IIRC, none of the three articles in nature make any reference to a hypothesis being validated ;)\n \n I'd describe it more as being an expectation being fufilled.",

Edwards, 482 U.S. at 591-92; McLean, 529 F. Supp. at 1267. First, defense expert Professor Fuller agreed that ID aspires to \"change the ground rules\" of science and lead defense expert Professor Behe admitted that his broadened definition of science, which encompasses ID, would also embrace astrology. (28:26 (Fuller); 21:37-42 (Behe)). Moreover, defense expert Professor Minnich acknowledged that for ID to be considered science, the ground rules of science have to be broadened to allow consideration of supernatural forces. (38:97 (Minnich)).\n \n Prominent IDM leaders are in agreement with the opinions expressed by defense expert witnesses that the ground rules of science must be changed for ID to take hold and prosper. William Dembski, for instance, an IDM leader, proclaims that science is ruled by methodological naturalism and argues that this rule must be overturned if ID is to prosper. (5:32-37 (Pennock)); P-341 at 224 (\"Indeed, entire fields of inquiry, including especially in the human sciences, will need to be rethought from the ground up in terms of intelligent design.\").\n \n The Discovery Institute, the think tank promoting ID whose CRSC developed the Wedge Document, acknowledges as \"Governing Goals\" to \"defeat scientific materialism and its destructive moral, cultural and political legacies\" and \"replace materialistic explanations with the theistic understanding that nature and human beings are created by God.\" (P-140 at 4). In addition, and as previously noted, the Wedge Document states in its \"Five Year Strategic Plan Summary\" that the IDM's goal is to replace science as currently practiced with \"theistic and Christian science.\" Id. at 6. The IDM accordingly seeks nothing less than a complete scientific revolution in which ID will supplant evolutionary theory.\n",

   "DamEtel: Several people here have explained to you, multiple times, for months now, that evolution is not atheistic.

You do your own leg work.\n \n Here, I've done mine to support my bolded statement above.\n \n The following is an excerpt from the case Tammy Kitzmiller vs. Dover Area School District - case :04-cv-02688-JEJ Document 342, Filed 12/20/2005 - heard in front Judge Jones of the US District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania (http://www.pamd.uscourts.gov/kitzmiller/kitzmiller_342.pdf). \n \n \n PS: Italics in the original were lost during the copy and paste process. \n \n \n\n A significant aspect of the IDM is that despite Defendants' protestations to the contrary, it describes ID as a religious argument. In that vein, the writings of leading ID proponents reveal that the designer postulated by their argument is the God of Christianity. Dr. Barbara Forrest, one of Plaintiffs' expert witnesses, is the author of the book Creationism's Trojan Horse. She has thoroughly and exhaustively chronicled the history of ID in her book and other writings for her testimony in this case. Her testimony, and the exhibits which were admitted with it, provide a wealth of statements by ID leaders that reveal ID's religious, philosophical, and cultural content. The following is a representative grouping of such statements made by prominent ID proponents.\n \n Phillip Johnson, considered to be the father of the IDM, developer of ID's \"Wedge Strategy,\" which will be discussed below, and author of the 1991 book entitled Darwin on Trial, has written that \"theistic realism\" or \"mere creation\" are defining concepts of the IDM. This means \"that God is objectively real as Creator and recorded in the biological evidence . . .\" (Trial Tr. vol. 10, Forrest Test., 80-81, Oct. 5, 2005; P-328). In addition, Phillip Johnson states that the \"Darwinian theory of evolution contradicts not just the Book of Genesis, but every word in the Bible from beginning to end. It contradicts the idea that we are here because a creator brought about our existence for a purpose.\" (11:16-17 (Forrest); P-524 at 1). ID proponents Johnson, William Dembski, and Charles Thaxton, one of the editors of Pandas, situate ID in the Book of John in the New Testament of the Bible, which begins, \"In the Beginning was the Word, and the Word was God.\" (11:18-20, 54-55 (Forrest); P-524; P-355; P-357). Dembski has written that ID is a \"ground clearing operation\" to allow Christianity to receive serious consideration, and \"Christ is never an addendum to a scientific theory but always a completion.\" (11:50-53 (Forrest); P-386; P-390). Moreover, in turning to Defendants' lead expert, Professor Behe, his testimony at trial indicated that ID is only a scientific, as opposed to a religious, project for him; however, considerable evidence was introduced to refute this claim. Consider, to illustrate, that Professor Behe remarkably and unmistakably claims that the plausibility of the argument for ID depends upon the extent to which one believes in the existence of God. (P-718 at 705) (emphasis added). As no evidence in the record indicates that any other scientific proposition's validity rests on belief in God, nor is the Court aware of any such scientific propositions, Professor Behe's assertion constitutes substantial evidence that in his view, as is commensurate with other prominent ID leaders, ID is a religious and not a scientific proposition.\n \n Dramatic evidence of ID's religious nature and aspirations is found in what is referred to as the \"Wedge Document.\" The Wedge Document, developed by the Discovery Institute's Center for Renewal of Science and Culture (hereinafter \"CRSC\"), represents from an institutional standpoint, the IDM's goals and objectives, much as writings from the Institute for Creation Research did for the earlier creation-science movement, as discussed in McLean. (11:26-28 (Forrest)); McLean, 529 F. Supp. at 1255. The Wedge Document states in its \"Five Year Strategic Plan Summary\" that the IDM's goal is to replace science as currently practiced with \"theistic and Christian science.\" (P-140 at 6). As posited in the Wedge Document, the IDM's \"Governing Goals\" are to \"defeat scientific materialism and its destructive moral, cultural, and political legacies\" and \"to replace materialistic explanations with the theistic understanding that nature and human beings are created by God.\" Id. at 4. The CSRC expressly announces, in the Wedge Document, a program of Christian apologetics to promote ID. A careful review of the Wedge Document's goals and language throughout the document reveals cultural and religious goals, as opposed to scientific ones.\n (11:26-48 (Forrest); P-140). ID aspires to change the ground rules of science to make room for religion, specifically, beliefs consonant with a particular version of Christianity.\n \n In addition to the IDM itself describing ID as a religious argument, ID's religious nature is evident because it involves a supernatural designer. The courts in Edwards and McLean expressly found that this characteristic removed creationism from the realm of science and made it a religious proposition. Edwards, 482 U.S. at 591-92; McLean, 529 F. Supp. at 1265-66. Prominent ID proponents have made abundantly clear that the designer is supernatural. \n \n Defendants' expert witness ID proponents confirmed that the existence of a supernatural designer is a hallmark of ID. First, Professor Behe has written that by ID he means \"not designed by the laws of nature,\" and that it is \"implausible that the designer is a natural entity.\" (P-647 at 193; P-718 at 696, 700). Second, Professor Minnich testified that for ID to be considered science, the ground rules of science have to be broadened so that supernatural forces can be considered. (38:97 (Minnich)). Third, Professor Steven William Fuller testified that it is ID's project to change the ground rules of science to include the supernatural. (Trial Tr. vol. 28, Fuller Test., 20-24, Oct. 24, 2005). Turning from defense expert witnesses\n to leading ID proponents, Johnson has concluded that science must be redefined to include the supernatural if religious challenges to evolution are to get a hearing. (11:8-15 (Forrest); P-429). Additionally, Dembski agrees that science is ruled by methodological naturalism and argues that this rule must be overturned if ID is to prosper. (Trial Tr. vol. 5, Pennock Test., 32-34, Sept. 28, 2005).\n \n Further support for the proposition that ID requires supernatural creation is found in the book Pandas, to which students in Dover's ninth grade biology class are directed. Pandas indicates that there are two kinds of causes, natural and intelligent, which demonstrate that intelligent causes are beyond nature. (P-11 at 6). Professor Haught, who as noted was the only theologian to testify in this case, explained that in Western intellectual tradition, non-natural causes occupy a space reserved for ultimate religious explanations. (9:13-14 (Haught)). Robert Pennock, Plaintiffs' expert in the philosophy of science, concurred with Professor Haught and concluded that because its basic proposition is that the features of the natural world are produced by a transcendent, immaterial, non-natural being, ID is a religious proposition regardless of whether that religious proposition is given a recognized religious label. (5:55-56 (Pennock)). It is notable that not one defense expert was able to explain how the supernatural action suggested by ID could be\n anything other than an inherently religious proposition. Accordingly, we find that ID's religious nature would be further evident to our objective observer because it directly involves a supernatural designer.\n \n A \"hypothetical reasonable observer,\" adult or child, who is \"aware of the history and context of the community and forum\" is also presumed to know that ID is a form of creationism. Child Evangelism, 386 F.3d at 531 (citations omitted); Allegheny, 492 U.S. at 624-25. The evidence at trial demonstrates that ID is nothing less than the progeny of creationism. What is likely the strongest evidence supporting the finding of ID's creationist nature is the history and historical pedigree of the book to which students in Dover's ninth grade biology class are referred, Pandas. Pandas is published by an organization called FTE, as noted, whose articles of incorporation and filings with the Internal Revenue Service describe it as a religious, Christian organization. (P-461; P-28; P-566; P-633; Buell Dep. 1:13, July 8, 2005). Pandas was written by Dean Kenyon and Percival Davis, both acknowledged creationists, and Nancy Pearcey, a Young Earth Creationist, contributed to the work. (10:102-08 (Forrest)).\n \n As Plaintiffs meticulously and effectively presented to the Court, Pandas went through many drafts, several of which were completed prior to and some after the Supreme Court's decision in Edwards, which held that the Constitution forbids teaching creationism as science. By comparing the pre and post Edwards drafts of Pandas, three astonishing points emerge: (1) the definition for creation science in early drafts is identical to the definition of ID; (2) cognates of the word creation (creationism and creationist), which appeared approximately 150 times were deliberately and systematically replaced with the phrase ID; and (3) the changes occurred shortly after the Supreme Court held that creation science is religious and cannot be taught in public school science classes in Edwards. This word substitution is telling, significant, and reveals that a purposeful change of words was effected without any corresponding change in content, which directly refutes FTE's argument that by merely disregarding the words \"creation\" and \"creationism,\" FTE expressly rejected creationism in Pandas. In early pre-Edwards drafts of Pandas, the term \"creation\" was defined as \"various forms of life that began abruptly through an intelligent agency with their distinctive features intact - fish with fins and scales, birds with feathers, beaks, and wings, etc,\" the very same way in which ID is defined in the subsequent published versions. (P-560 at 210; P-1 at 2-13; P-562 at 2-14, P-652 at 2-15; P-6 at 99-100; P-11 at 99-100; P-856.2.). This definition was described by many witnesses for both parties, notably including defense experts Minnich and Fuller, as \"special creation\" of kinds of animals, an inherently religious and creationist concept. (28:85-86(Fuller); Minnich Dep. at 34, May 26, 2005; Trial Tr. vol. 1, Miller Test., 141-42, Sept. 26, 2005; 9:10 (Haught); Trial Tr. vol. 33, Bonsell Test., 54-56, Oct. 31, 2005). Professor Behe's assertion that this passage was merely a description of appearances in the fossil record is illogical and defies the weight of the evidence that the passage is a conclusion about how life began based upon an interpretation of the fossil record, which is reinforced by the content of drafts of Pandas.\n \n The weight of the evidence clearly demonstrates, as noted, that the systemic change from \"creation\" to \"intelligent design\" occurred sometime in 1987, after the Supreme Court's important Edwards decision. This compelling evidence strongly supports Plaintiffs' assertion that ID is creationism re-labeled. Importantly, the objective observer, whether adult or child, would conclude from the fact that Pandas posits a master intellect that the intelligent designer is God. \n \n Further evidence in support of the conclusion that a reasonable observer, adult or child, who is \"aware of the history and context of the community and forum\" is presumed to know that ID is a form of creationism concerns the fact that ID uses the same, or exceedingly similar arguments as were posited in support of creationism. One significant difference is that the words \"God,\" \"creationism,\" and \"Genesis\" have been systematically purged from ID explanations, and replaced by an unnamed \"designer.\" Dr. Forrest testified and sponsored exhibits showing six arguments common to creationists. (10:140-48 (Forrest); P-856.5-856.10). Demonstrative charts introduced through Dr. Forrest show parallel arguments relating to the rejection of naturalism, evolution's threat to culture and society, \"abrupt appearance\" implying divine creation, the exploitation of the same alleged gaps in the fossil record, the alleged inability of science to explain complex biological information like DNA, as well as the theme that proponents of each version of creationism merely aim to teach a scientific alternative to evolution to show its \"strengths and weaknesses,\" and to alert students to a supposed \"controversy\" in the scientific community. (10:140-48 (Forrest)). In addition, creationists made the same argument that the complexity of the bacterial flagellum supported creationism as Professors Behe and Minnich now make for ID. (P-853;P-845; 37:155-56 (Minnich)). The IDM openly welcomes adherents to creationism into its \"Big Tent,\" urging them to postpone biblical disputes like the age of the earth. (11:3-15 (Forrest); P-429). Moreover and as previously stated, there is hardly better evidence of ID's relationship with creationism than an explicit statement by defense expert Fuller that ID is a form of creationism. (Fuller Dep. at 67, June 21, 2005) (indicated that ID is a modern view of creationism).\n \n\n \n that much shows that ID is religious, next, to show that it's not science...",

   "and now, legal statements show that ID is not science...\n \n \n4. Whether ID is Science\n After a searching review of the record and applicable caselaw, we find that while ID arguments may be true, a proposition on which the Court takes no position, ID is not science. We find that ID fails on three different levels, any one of which is sufficient to preclude a determination that ID is science. They are: (1) ID violates the centuries-old ground rules of science by invoking and permitting supernatural causation; (2) the argument of irreducible complexity, central to ID, employs the same flawed and illogical contrived dualism that doomed creation science in the 1980's; and (3) ID's negative attacks on evolution have been refuted by the scientific community. As we will discuss in more detail below, it is additionally important to note that ID has failed to gain acceptance in the scientific community, it has not generated peer-reviewed publications, nor has it been the subject of testing and research.\n \n Expert testimony reveals that since the scientific revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries, science has been limited to the search for natural causes to explain natural phenomena. (9:19-22 (Haught); 5:25-29 (Pennock); 1:62 (Miller)). This revolution entailed the rejection of the appeal to authority, and by extension, revelation, in favor of empirical evidence. (5:28 (Pennock)). Since that time period, science has been a discipline in which testability, rather than any ecclesiastical authority or philosophical coherence, has been the measure of a scientific idea's worth. (9:21-22 (Haught); 1:63 (Miller)). In deliberately omitting theological or \"ultimate\" explanations for the existence or characteristics of the natural world, science does not consider issues of \"meaning\" and \"purpose\" in the world. (9:21 (Haught); 1:64, 87 (Miller)). While supernatural explanations may be important and have merit, they are not part of science. (3:103 (Miller); 9:19-20 (Haught)). This self-imposed convention of science, which limits inquiry to testable, natural explanations about the natural world, is referred to by philosophers as \"methodological naturalism\" and is sometimes known as the scientific method. (5:23, 29-30 (Pennock)). Methodological naturalism is a \"ground rule\" of science today which requires scientists to seek explanations in the world around us based upon what we can observe, test, replicate, and verify. (1:59-64, 2:41-43 (Miller); 5:8, 23-30 (Pennock)). \n \n As the National Academy of Sciences (hereinafter \"NAS\") was recognized by experts for both parties as the \"most prestigious\" scientific association in this country, we will accordingly cite to its opinion where appropriate. (1:94, 160-61 (Miller); 14:72 (Alters); 37:31 (Minnich)). NAS is in agreement that science is limited to empirical, observable and ultimately testable data: \"Science is a particular way of knowing about the world. In science, explanations are restricted to those that can be inferred from the confirmable data - the results obtained through observations and experiments that can be substantiated by other scientists. Anything that can be observed or measured is amenable to scientific investigation. Explanations that cannot be based upon empirical evidence are not part of science.\" (P-649 at 27).\n \n This rigorous attachment to \"natural\" explanations is an essential attribute to science by definition and by convention. (1:63 (Miller); 5:29-31 (Pennock)). We are in agreement with Plaintiffs' lead expert Dr. Miller, that from a practical perspective, attributing unsolved problems about nature to causes and forces that lie outside the natural world is a \"science stopper.\" (3:14-15 (Miller)). As Dr. Miller explained, once you attribute a cause to an untestable supernatural force, a proposition that cannot be disproven, there is no reason to continue seeking natural explanations as we have our answer. Id. \n \n ID is predicated on supernatural causation, as we previously explained and as various expert testimony revealed. (17:96 (Padian); 2:35-36 (Miller); 14:62 (Alters)). ID takes a natural phenomenon and, instead of accepting or seeking a natural explanation, argues that the explanation is supernatural. (5:107 (Pennock)). Further support for the conclusion that ID is predicated on supernatural causation is found in the ID reference book to which ninth grade biology students are directed, Pandas. Pandas states, in pertinent part, as follows:\n \n Darwinists object to the view of intelligent design because it does not give a natural cause explanation of how the various forms of life started in the first place. Intelligent design means that various forms of life began abruptly, through an intelligent agency, with their distinctive features already intact - fish with fins and scales, birds with feathers, beaks, and wings, etc.\n \n P-11 at 99-100 (emphasis added). Stated another way, ID posits that animals did not evolve naturally through evolutionary means but were created abruptly by a non-natural, or supernatural, designer. Defendants' own expert witnesses acknowledged this point. (21:96-100 (Behe); P-718 at 696, 700 (\"implausible that the designer is a natural entity\"); 28:21-22 (Fuller) (\". . . ID's rejection of naturalism and commitment to supernaturalism . . .\"); 38:95-96 (Minnich) (ID does not exclude the possibility of a supernatural designer, including deities).\n \n It is notable that defense experts' own mission, which mirrors that of the IDM itself, is to change the ground rules of science to allow supernatural causation of the natural world, which the Supreme Court in Edwards and the court in McLean correctly recognized as an inherently religious concept. Edwards, 482 U.S. at 591-92; McLean, 529 F. Supp. at 1267. First, defense expert Professor Fuller agreed that ID aspires to \"change the ground rules\" of science and lead defense expert Professor Behe admitted that his broadened definition of science, which encompasses ID, would also embrace astrology. (28:26 (Fuller); 21:37-42 (Behe)). Moreover, defense expert Professor Minnich acknowledged that for ID to be considered science, the ground rules of science have to be broadened to allow consideration of supernatural forces. (38:97 (Minnich)).\n \n Prominent IDM leaders are in agreement with the opinions expressed by defense expert witnesses that the ground rules of science must be changed for ID to take hold and prosper. William Dembski, for instance, an IDM leader, proclaims that science is ruled by methodological naturalism and argues that this rule must be overturned if ID is to prosper. (5:32-37 (Pennock)); P-341 at 224 (\"Indeed, entire fields of inquiry, including especially in the human sciences, will need to be rethought from the ground up in terms of intelligent design.\").\n \n The Discovery Institute, the think tank promoting ID whose CRSC developed the Wedge Document, acknowledges as \"Governing Goals\" to \"defeat scientific materialism and its destructive moral, cultural and political legacies\" and \"replace materialistic explanations with the theistic understanding that nature and human beings are created by God.\" (P-140 at 4). In addition, and as previously noted, the Wedge Document states in its \"Five Year Strategic Plan Summary\" that the IDM's goal is to replace science as currently practiced with \"theistic and Christian science.\" Id. at 6. The IDM accordingly seeks nothing less than a complete scientific revolution in which ID will supplant evolutionary theory.\n \n Notably, every major scientific association that has taken a position on the issue of whether ID is science has concluded that ID is not, and cannot be considered as such. (1:98-99 (Miller); 14:75-78 (Alters); 37:25 (Minnich)). Initially, we note that NAS, the \"most prestigious\" scientific association in this country, views ID as follows:\n \n Creationism, intelligent design, and other claims of supernatural intervention in the origin of life or of species are not science because they are not testable by the methods of science. These claims subordinate observed data to statements based on authority, revelation, or religious belief. Documentation offered in support of these claims is typically limited to the special publications of their advocates. These publications do not offer hypotheses subject to change in light of new data, new interpretations, or demonstration of error. This contrasts with science, where any hypothesis or theory always remains subject to the possibility of rejection or modification in the light of new knowledge.\n \n P-192 at 25. Additionally, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (hereinafter \"AAAS\"), the largest organization of scientists in this country, has taken a similar position on ID, namely, that it \"has not proposed a scientific means of testing its claims\" and that \"the lack of scientific warrant for so-called 'intelligent design theory' makes it improper to include as part of science education . . .\" (P-198). Not a single expert witness over the course of the six week trial identified one major scientific association, society or organization that endorsed ID as science. What is more, defense experts concede that ID is not a theory as that term is defined by the NAS and admit that ID is at best \"fringe science\" which has achieved no acceptance in the scientific community. (21:37-38 (Behe); Fuller Dep. at 98-101, June 21, 2005; 28:47 (Fuller); Minnich Dep. at 89, May 26, 2005). \n \n It is therefore readily apparent to the Court that ID fails to meet the essential ground rules that limit science to testable, natural explanations. (3:101-03 (Miller); 14:62 (Alters)). Science cannot be defined differently for Dover students than it is defined in the scientific community as an affirmative action program, as advocated by Professor Fuller, for a view that has been unable to gain a foothold within the scientific establishment. Although ID's failure to meet the ground rules of science is sufficient for the Court to conclude that it is not science, out of an abundance of caution and in the exercise of completeness, we will analyze additional arguments advanced regarding the concepts of ID and science.\n \n ID is at bottom premised upon a false dichotomy, namely, that to the extent evolutionary theory is discredited, ID is confirmed. (5:41 (Pennock)). This argument is not brought to this Court anew, and in fact, the same argument, termed \"contrived dualism\" in McLean, was employed by creationists in the 1980's to support \"creation science.\" The court in McLean noted the \"fallacious pedagogy of the two model approach\" and that \"[i]n efforts to establish 'evidence' in support of creation science, the defendants relied upon the same false premise as the two model approach . . . all evidence which criticized evolutionary theory was proof in support of creation science.\" McLean, 529 F. Supp. at 1267, 1269. We do not find this false dichotomy any more availing to justify ID today than it was to justify creation science two decades ago.\n \n ID proponents primarily argue for design through negative arguments against evolution, as illustrated by Professor Behe's argument that \"irreducibly complex\" systems cannot be produced through Darwinian, or any natural, mechanisms. (5:38-41 (Pennock); 1:39, 2:15, 2:35-37, 3:96 (Miller); 16:72-73 (Padian); 10:148 (Forrest)). However, we believe that arguments against evolution are not arguments for design. Expert testimony revealed that just because scientists cannot explain today how biological systems evolved does not mean that they cannot, and will not, be able to explain them tomorrow. (2:36-37 (Miller)). As Dr. Padian aptly noted, \"absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.\" (17:45 (Padian)). To that end, expert testimony from Drs. Miller and Padian provided multiple examples where Pandas asserted that no natural explanations exist, and in some cases that none could exist, and yet natural explanations have been identified in the intervening years. It also bears mentioning that as Dr. Miller stated, just because scientists cannot explain every evolutionary detail does not undermine its validity as a scientific theory as no theory in science is fully understood. (3:102 (Miller)).\n \n As referenced, the concept of irreducible complexity is ID's alleged scientific centerpiece. Irreducible complexity is a negative argument against evolution, not proof of design, a point conceded by defense expert Professor Minnich. (2:15 (Miller); 38:82 (Minnich) (irreducible complexity \"is not a test of\n intelligent design; it's a test of evolution\"). Irreducible complexity additionally fails to make a positive scientific case for ID, as will be elaborated upon below. \n \n We initially note that irreducible complexity as defined by Professor Behe in his book Darwin's Black Box and subsequently modified in his 2001 article entitled \"Reply to My Critics,\" appears as follows:\n \n By irreducibly complex I mean a single system which is composed of several well-matched, interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning. An irreducibly complex system cannot be produced directly by slight, successive modifications of a precursor system, because any precursor to an irreducibly complex system that is missing a part is by definition nonfunctional . . . Since natural selection can only choose systems that are already working, then if a biological system cannot be produced gradually it would have to arise as an integrated unit, in one fell swoop, for natural selection to have anything to act on.\n \n P-647 at 39; P-718 at 694. Professor Behe admitted in \"Reply to My Critics\" that there was a defect in his view of irreducible complexity because, while it purports to be a challenge to natural selection, it does not actually address \"the task facing natural selection.\" (P-718 at 695). Professor Behe specifically explained that \"[t]he current definition puts the focus on removing a part from an already functioning system,\" but \"[t]he difficult task facing Darwinian evolution, however, would not be to remove parts from sophisticated pre-existing systems; it would be to bring together components to make a new system in the first place.\" Id. In that article, Professor Behe wrote that he hoped to \"repair this defect in future work;\" however, he has failed to do so even four years after elucidating his defect. Id.; 22:61-65 (Behe).\n \n In addition to Professor Behe's admitted failure to properly address the very phenomenon that irreducible complexity purports to place at issue, natural selection, Drs. Miller and Padian testified that Professor Behe's concept of irreducible complexity depends on ignoring ways in which evolution is known to occur. Although Professor Behe is adamant in his definition of irreducible complexity when he says a precursor \"missing a part is by definition nonfunctional,\" what he obviously means is that it will not function in the same way the system functions when all the parts are present. For example in the case of the bacterial flagellum, removal of a part may prevent it from acting as a rotary motor. However, Professor Behe excludes, by definition, the possibility that a precursor to the bacterial flagellum functioned not as a rotary motor, but in some other way, for example as a secretory system. (19:88-95 (Behe)).\n \n As expert testimony revealed, the qualification on what is meant by \"irreducible complexity\" renders it meaningless as a criticism of evolution. (3:40 (Miller)). In fact, the theory of evolution proffers exaptation as a well-recognized, well-documented explanation for how systems with multiple parts could have evolved through natural means. Exaptation means that some precursor of the subject system had a different, selectable function before experiencing the change or addition that resulted in the subject system with its present function (16:146-48 (Padian)). For instance, Dr. Padian identified the evolution of the mammalian middle ear bones from what had been jawbones as an example of this process. (17:6-17 (Padian)). By defining irreducible complexity in the way that he has, Professor Behe attempts to exclude the phenomenon of exaptation by definitional fiat, ignoring as he does so abundant evidence which refutes his argument.\n \n Notably, the NAS has rejected Professor Behe's claim for irreducible complexity by using the following cogent reasoning:\n \n [S]tructures and processes that are claimed to be 'irreducibly' complex typically are not on closer inspection. For example, it is incorrect to assume that a complex structure or biochemical process can function only if all its components are present and functioning as we see them today. Complex biochemical systems can be built up from simpler systems through natural selection. Thus, the 'history' of a protein can be traced through simpler organisms . . . The evolution of complex molecular systems can occur in several ways. Natural selection can bring together parts of a system for one function at one time and then, at a later time, recombine those parts with other systems of components to produce a system that has a different function. Genes can be duplicated, altered, and then amplified through natural selection. The complex biochemical cascade resulting in blood clotting has been explained in this fashion. \n \n P-192 at 22.\n \n As irreducible complexity is only a negative argument against evolution, it is refutable and accordingly testable, unlike ID, by showing that there are intermediate structures with selectable functions that could have evolved into the allegedly irreducibly complex systems. (2:15-16 (Miller)). Importantly, however, the fact that the negative argument of irreducible complexity is testable does not make testable the argument for ID. (2:15 (Miller); 5:39 (Pennock)). Professor Behe has applied the concept of irreducible complexity to only a few select systems: (1) the bacterial flagellum; (2) the blood-clotting cascade; and (3) the immune system. Contrary to Professor Behe's assertions with respect to these few biochemical systems among the myriad existing in nature, however, Dr. Miller presented evidence, based upon peer-reviewed studies, that they are not in fact irreducibly complex.\n \n First, with regard to the bacterial flagellum, Dr. Miller pointed to peer reviewed studies that identified a possible precursor to the bacterial flagellum, a subsystem that was fully functional, namely the Type-III Secretory System. (2:8- 20 (Miller); P-854.23-854.32). Moreover, defense expert Professor Minnich admited that there is serious scientific research on the question of whether the bacterial flagellum evolved into the Type-III Secretary System, the Type-III Secretory System into the bacterial flagellum, or whether they both evolved from a common ancestor. (38:12-16 (Minnich)). None of this research or thinking involves ID. (38:12-16 (Minnich)). In fact, Professor Minnich testified about his research as follows: \"we're looking at the function of these systems and how they could have been derived one from the other. And it's a legitimate scientific inquiry.\" (38:16 (Minnich)).\n \n Second, with regard to the blood-clotting cascade, Dr. Miller demonstrated that the alleged irreducible complexity of the blood-clotting cascade has been disproven by peer-reviewed studies dating back to 1969, which show that dolphins' and whales' blood clots despite missing a part of the cascade, a study that was confirmed by molecular testing in 1998. (1:122-29 (Miller); P-854.17-854.22). Additionally and more recently, scientists published studies showing that in puffer fish, blood clots despite the cascade missing not only one, but three parts. (1:128-29 (Miller)). Accordingly, scientists in peer-reviewed publications have refuted Professor Behe's predication about the alleged irreducible complexity of the blood-clotting cascade. Moreover, cross-examination revealed that Professor Behe's redefinition of the blood-clotting system was likely designed to avoid peerreviewed scientific evidence that falsifies his argument, as it was not a scientifically warranted redefinition. (20:26-28, 22:112-25 (Behe)). \n \n The immune system is the third system to which Professor Behe has applied the definition of irreducible complexity. Although in Darwin's Black Box, Professor Behe wrote that not only were there no natural explanations for the immune system at the time, but that natural explanations were impossible regarding its origin. (P-647 at 139; 2:26-27 (Miller)). However, Dr. Miller presented peer-reviewed studies refuting Professor Behe's claim that the immune system was irreducibly complex. Between 1996 and 2002, various studies confirmed each element of the evolutionary hypothesis explaining the origin of the immune system. (2:31 (Miller)). In fact, on cross-examination, Professor Behe was questioned concerning his 1996 claim that science would never find an evolutionary explanation for the immune system. He was presented with fiftyeight peer-reviewed publications, nine books, and several immunology textbook chapters about the evolution of the immune system; however, he simply insisted that this was still not sufficient evidence of evolution, and that it was not \"good enough.\" (23:19 (Behe)).\n \n We find that such evidence demonstrates that the ID argument is dependent upon setting a scientifically unreasonable burden of proof for the theory of evolution. As a further example, the test for ID proposed by both Professors Behe and Minnich is to grow the bacterial flagellum in the laboratory; however, no-one inside or outside of the IDM, including those who propose the test, has conducted it. (P-718; 18:125-27 (Behe); 22:102-06 (Behe)). Professor Behe conceded that the proposed test could not approximate real world conditions and even if it could, Professor Minnich admitted that it would merely be a test of evolution, not design. (22:107-10 (Behe); 2:15 (Miller); 38:82 (Minnich)).\n \n We therefore find that Professor Behe's claim for irreducible complexity has been refuted in peer-reviewed research papers and has been rejected by the scientific community at large. (17:45-46 (Padian); 3:99 (Miller)). Additionally, even if irreducible complexity had not been rejected, it still does not support ID as it is merely a test for evolution, not design. (2:15, 2:35-40 (Miller); 28:63-66 (Fuller)).\n \n We will now consider the purportedly \"positive argument\" for design encompassed in the phrase used numerous times by Professors Behe and Minnich throughout their expert testimony, which is the \"purposeful arrangement of parts.\" Professor Behe summarized the argument as follows: We infer design when we see parts that appear to be arranged for a purpose. The strength of the inference is quantitative; the more parts that are arranged, the more intricately they interact, the stronger is our confidence in design. The appearance of design in aspects of biology is overwhelming. Since nothing other than an intelligent cause has been demonstrated to be able to yield such a strong appearance of design, Darwinian claims notwithstanding, the conclusion that the design seen in life is real design is rationally justified. (18:90-91, 18:109-10 (Behe); 37:50 (Minnich)). As previously indicated, this argument is merely a restatement of the Reverend William Paley's argument applied at the cell level. Minnich, Behe, and Paley reach the same conclusion, that complex organisms must have been designed using the same reasoning, except that Professors Behe and Minnich refuse to identify the designer, whereas Paley inferred from the presence of design that it was God. (1:6-7 (Miller); 38:44, 57 (Minnich)). Expert testimony revealed that this inductive argument is not scientific and as admitted by Professor Behe, can never be ruled out. (2:40 (Miller); 22:101 (Behe); 3:99 (Miller)).\n \n Indeed, the assertion that design of biological systems can be inferred from the \"purposeful arrangement of parts\" is based upon an analogy to human design. Because we are able to recognize design of artifacts and objects, according to Professor Behe, that same reasoning can be employed to determine biological design. (18:116-17, 23:50 (Behe)). Professor Behe testified that the strength of the analogy depends upon the degree of similarity entailed in the two propositions; however, if this is the test, ID completely fails.\n \n Unlike biological systems, human artifacts do not live and reproduce over time. They are non-replicable, they do not undergo genetic recombination, and they are not driven by natural selection. (1:131-33 (Miller); 23:57-59 (Behe)). For human artifacts, we know the designer's identity, human, and the mechanism of design, as we have experience based upon empirical evidence that humans can make such things, as well as many other attributes including the designer's abilities, needs, and desires. (D-251 at 176; 1:131-33 (Miller); 23:63 (Behe); 5:55-58 (Pennock)). With ID, proponents assert that they refuse to propose hypotheses on the designer's identity, do not propose a mechanism, and the designer, he/she/it/they, has never been seen. In that vein, defense expert Professor Minnich agreed that in the case of human artifacts and objects, we know the identity and capacities of the human designer, but we do not know any of those attributes for the designer of biological life. (38:44-47 (Minnich)). In addition, Professor Behe agreed that for the design of human artifacts, we know the designer and its attributes and we have a baseline for human design that does not exist for design of biological systems. (23:61-73 (Behe)). Professor Behe's only response to these seemingly insurmountable points of disanalogy was that the inference still works in science fiction movies. (23:73 (Behe)).\n \n It is readily apparent to the Court that the only attribute of design that biological systems appear to share with human artifacts is their complex appearance, i.e. if it looks complex or designed, it must have been designed. (23:73 (Behe)). This inference to design based upon the appearance of a \"purposeful arrangement of parts\" is a completely subjective proposition, determined in the eye of each beholder and his/her viewpoint concerning the complexity of a system. Although both Professors Behe and Minnich assert that there is a quantitative aspect to the inference, on cross-examination they admitted that there is no quantitative criteria for determining the degree of complexity or number of parts that bespeak design, rather than a natural process. (23:50 (Behe); 38:59 (Minnich)). As Plaintiffs aptly submit to the Court, throughout the entire trial only one piece of evidence generated by Defendants addressed the strength of the ID inference: the argument is less plausible to those for whom God's existence is in question, and is much less plausible for those who deny God's existence. (P-718 at 705).\n \n Accordingly, the purported positive argument for ID does not satisfy the ground rules of science which require testable hypotheses based upon natural explanations. (3:101-03 (Miller)). ID is reliant upon forces acting outside of the natural world, forces that we cannot see, replicate, control or test, which have produced changes in this world. While we take no position on whether such forces exist, they are simply not testable by scientific means and therefore cannot qualify as part of the scientific process or as a scientific theory. (3:101-02 (Miller)).\n \n It is appropriate at this juncture to address ID's claims against evolution. ID proponents support their assertion that evolutionary theory cannot account for life's complexity by pointing to real gaps in scientific knowledge, which indisputably exist in all scientific theories, but also by misrepresenting well established scientific propositions. (1:112, 1:122, 1:136-37 (Miller); 16:74-79, 17:45-46 (Padian)).\n \n Before discussing Defendants' claims about evolution, we initially note that an overwhelming number of scientists, as reflected by every scientific association that has spoken on the matter, have rejected the ID proponents' challenge to evolution. Moreover, Plaintiffs' expert in biology, Dr. Miller, a widely-recognized biology professor at Brown University who has written university-level and high school biology textbooks used prominently throughout the nation, provided unrebutted testimony that evolution, including common descent and natural selection, is \"overwhelmingly accepted\" by the scientific community and that every major scientific association agrees. (1:94-100 (Miller)). As the court in Selman explained, \"evolution is more than a theory of origin in the context of science. To the contrary, evolution is the dominant scientific theory of origin accepted by the majority of scientists.\" Selman, 390 F. Supp. 2d at 1309 (emphasis in original). Despite the scientific community's overwhelming support for evolution, Defendants and ID proponents insist that evolution is unsupported by empirical evidence. Plaintiffs' science experts, Drs. Miller and Padian, clearly explained how ID proponents generally and Pandas specifically, distort and misrepresent scientific knowledge in making their anti-evolution argument. \n \n In analyzing such distortion, we turn again to Pandas, the book to which students are expressly referred in the disclaimer. Defendants hold out Pandas as representative of ID and Plaintiffs' experts agree in that regard. (16:83 (Padian); 1:107-08 (Miller)). A series of arguments against evolutionary theory found in Pandas involve paleontology, which studies the life of the past and the fossil record. Plaintiffs' expert Professor Padian was the only testifying expert witness with any expertise in paleontology. His testimony therefore remains unrebutted. Dr. Padian's demonstrative slides, prepared on the basis of peer-reviewing scientific literature, illustrate how Pandas systematically distorts and misrepresents established, important evolutionary principles.\n \n We will provide several representative examples of this distortion. First, Pandas misrepresents the \"dominant form of understanding relationships\" between organisms, namely, the tree of life, represented by classification determined via the method of cladistics. (16:87-97 (Padian); P-855.6-855.19). Second, Pandas misrepresents \"homology,\" the \"central concept of comparative biology,\" that allowed scientists to evaluate comparable parts among organisms for classification purposes for hundreds of years. (17:27-40 (Padian); P-855.83-855.102). Third, Pandas fails to address the well-established biological concept of exaptation, which involves a structure changing function, such as fish fins evolving fingers and bones to become legs for weight-bearing land animals. (16:146-48 (Padian)). Dr. Padian testified that ID proponents fail to address exaptation because they deny that organisms change function, which is a view necessary to support abruptappearance. Id. Finally, Dr. Padian's unrebutted testimony demonstrates that Pandas distorts and misrepresents evidence in the fossil record about pre-Cambrian-era fossils, the evolution of fish to amphibians, the evolution of small carnivorous dinosaurs into birds, the evolution of the mammalian middle ear, and the evolution of whales from land animals. (16:107-17, 16:117-31, 16:131-45, 17:6-9, 17:17-27 (Padian); P-855.25-855.33, P-855.34-855.45, P-855.46-855.55, P-855.56-866.63, P-855.64-855.82).\n \n In addition to Dr. Padian, Dr. Miller also testified that Pandas presents discredited science. Dr. Miller testified that Pandas' treatment of biochemical Additionally, testimony provided by Professor Behe revealed an increasing gap between his portrayal of ID theory and how it is presented in Pandas. Although he is a \"critical reviewer\" of the work, he disagrees with language provided in the text, including but not limited to the text's very definition of ID. (P-11 at 99-100). similarities between organisms is \"inaccurate and downright false\" and explained how Pandas misrepresents basic molecular biology concepts to advance design theory through a series of demonstrative slides. (1:112 (Miller)). Consider, for example, that he testified as to how Pandas misinforms readers on the standard evolutionary relationships between different types of animals, a distortion which Professor Behe, a \"critical reviewer\" of Pandas who wrote a section within the book, affirmed. (1:113-17 (Miller); P-854.9-854.16; 23:35-36 (Behe)). In addition, Dr. Miller refuted Pandas' claim that evolution cannot account for new genetic information and pointed to more than three dozen peer-reviewed scientific publications showing the origin of new genetic information by evolutionary processes. (1:133-36 (Miller); P-245). In summary, Dr. Miller testified that Pandas misrepresents molecular biology and genetic principles, as well as the current state of scientific knowledge in those areas in order to teach readers that common descent and natural selection are not scientifically sound. (1:139-42 (Miller)).\n \n Accordingly, the one textbook to which the Dover ID Policy directs students contains outdated concepts and badly flawed science, as recognized by even the defense experts in this case. \n \n A final indicator of how ID has failed to demonstrate scientific warrant is the complete absence of peer-reviewed publications supporting the theory. Expert testimony revealed that the peer review process is \"exquisitely important\" in the scientific process. It is a way for scientists to write up their empirical research and to share the work with fellow experts in the field, opening up the hypotheses to study, testing, and criticism. (1:66-69 (Miller)). In fact, defense expert Professor Behe recognizes the importance of the peer review process and has written that science must \"publish or perish.\" (22:19-25 (Behe)). Peer review helps to ensure that research papers are scientifically accurately, meet the standards of the scientific method, and are relevant to other scientists in the field. (1:39-40 (Miller)). Moreover, peer review involves scientists submitting a manuscript to a scientific journal in the field, journal editors soliciting critical reviews from other experts in the field and deciding whether the scientist has followed proper research\n procedures, employed up-to-date methods, considered and cited relevant literature and generally, whether the researcher has employed sound science.\n \n The evidence presented in this case demonstrates that ID is not supported by any peer-reviewed research, data or publications. Both Drs. Padian and Forrest testified that recent literature reviews of scientific and medical-electronic databases disclosed no studies supporting a biological concept of ID. (17:42-43 (Padian);11:32-33 (Forrest)). On cross-examination, Professor Behe admitted that: \"There are no peer reviewed articles by anyone advocating for intelligent design supported by pertinent experiments or calculations which provide detailed rigorous accounts of how intelligent design of any biological system occurred.\" (22:22-23 (Behe)). Additionally, Professor Behe conceded that there are no peer-reviewed papers supporting his claims that complex molecular systems, like the bacterial flagellum, the blood-clotting cascade, and the immune system, were intelligently designed. (21:61-62 (complex molecular systems), 23:4-5 (immune system), and 22:124-25 (blood-clotting cascade) (Behe)). In that regard, there are no peer-reviewed articles supporting Professor Behe's argument that certain complex molecular structures are \"irreducibly complex.\"17 (21:62, 22:124-25 (Behe)). In addition to failing to produce papers in peer-reviewed journals, ID also features no scientific research or testing. (28:114-15 (Fuller); 18:22-23, 105-06 (Behe)).\n \n After this searching and careful review of ID as espoused by its proponents, as elaborated upon in submissions to the Court, and as scrutinized over a six week trial, we find that ID is not science and cannot be adjudged a valid, accepted scientific theory as it has failed to publish in peer-reviewed journals, engage in research and testing, and gain acceptance in the scientific community. ID, as noted, is grounded in theology, not science. Accepting for the sake of argument its proponents', as well as Defendants' argument that to introduce ID to students will encourage critical thinking, it still has utterly no place in a science curriculum. Moreover, ID's backers have sought to avoid the scientific scrutiny which we have now determined that it cannot withstand by advocating that the controversy, but not ID itself, should be taught in science class. This tactic is at best disingenuous, and at worst a canard. The goal of the IDM is not to encourage critical thought, but to foment a revolution which would supplant evolutionary theory with ID.\n \n To conclude and reiterate, we express no opinion on the ultimate veracity of ID as a supernatural explanation. However, we commend to the attention of those who are inclined to superficially consider ID to be a true \"scientific\" alternative to evolution without a true understanding of the concept the foregoing detailed analysis. It is our view that a reasonable, objective observer would, after reviewing both the voluminous record in this case, and our narrative, reach the inescapable conclusion that ID is an interesting theological argument, but that it is not science.\n \n\n \n So, it's official: Intellgent Design is religious, and, it is not science.",

   "To be honest, I thought it had already been thoroughly answered by other posters. But if you want my twopennorth, here goes. \n\n \n Thoroughly?? It's no wonder you have such an easy time with evolution. When if fits your presuppositions, thoroughly comes easy.\n \n \nThe discovery of Tiktaalik was a \"win\" for science in two senses. First, it added to our knowledge of the processes involved in the emergence of the earliest tetrapods; and second, it was a superb appilcation of deductive reasoning. \n\n \n This one's from the link in the first post;\n \n\"The flexible robust limbs appear to be connected with pushing the head out of the water to breathe the air.\" \n\n \n And this one's from one of your helpers here;\n \n[The 'fishapod'] had the scales, teeth, and gills of a fish, but also a big, curved rib cage that suggests the creature had lungs as well. The ribs interlock, moreover, unlike a fish's, implying they were able to bear fishapod's weight - an unnecessary trait in a fish. It had a neck - most unfishlike. And, most surprising of all, its pectoral fins included bones that look like nothing less than a primitive wrist and fingers.\n (A Fish with Fingers?, Michael Lemonick, Time: Science and Health, Apr 05 2006) \n\n \n \"Appear to be\" - \"suggests\" - \"implying\" - \"look like\" This isn't the same type of scientific decuctive reasoning that goes into non controversial study of the here and now, like life that exists on the planet TODAY, that tells us just about all we need to know about life as it exists today. All these positive assertions about what happened on earth millions of years ago are based on presuppositions.\n \n \n \nThe only person on this board to have taken the view that the discovery 'discredited religion' is yourself. \n\n \n So anyone who doesn't post on this thread DECLARES that they don't agree with me?? You're as good with deductive reasoning as those who discovered the Tiktaalik. \n \n \nThis discovery and religion inhabit separate realms of human thought and endeavour;\n\n \n Is that the reason your immediate reaction to it was to mock and ridicule ID in post #2?? Not that that's anything unusual - your views against ID are very common and mainstream. That's why millions of people who see the results of this \"discovery\" have exactly the same knee-jerk reaction you did, to belittle ID. And it's publicly funded! Establishing atheism a whole bunch more than public displays of the ten commandments.\n \n \n \n \nAre you suggesting that the only scientific research permissible is that which has a clearly defined practical goal? Presumably you would abolish cosmology as well; not to mention pure mathematics. \n\n \n No, I'm suggesting that the only scientific research permissible should be determined by more than just the scientific community and the courts. The legislative process and the people who actually fund it for example.\n \n \n \n \nWhat an extraordinary non sequitur. Nothing in DamEtel's quoted text suggested anything of the sort. I can only assume that you equate 'explaining the natural world by means of natural mechanisms' with 'trying to prove that there is no God'. \n\n \n I equate it that way because of your post #2. \n \n \n Should scientists, then, be forbidden from undertaking such a quest? Are we really back there with Galileo and the Inquisition?\n\n \n With tax money, yes. Our country probably has less money to waste than did Galileo.",

   "I'm never impressed by parrot reversal of statements; the above example is no exception. Also, your view is too limited if you think opposition to Dawkin's outlook on religion is limited to a conern about \"the foundation and heritage of U.S. politics\" (which I would like you to explain in more detail as it is a vague statement.) \n\n \n Biblical guidelines of behavior played a part in how the foundation of the country was formed, and how it was interpreted by the courts up untill about 60 years ago. Since then, as man more and more thinks of himself as the highest form of intelligence, the courts tend to reverse and change what worked. \n \n \n \n \nI very much doubt that to the case...... if you re-read what I said it was in reference to his public reproaches.\n \n \n The creationist objection to evolution etc. is an opposition to humanism and any non-biblical field of intellectual endevour that might comment upon human origins.\n \n \n We'd all get along alot more happily with less monotheism :) \n\n \n Your opinions - it's political.\n \n \n \n \nNo, its to expand the limits of our understanding of the natural world.

It is hardly surprising considering the mockery that some religious people make of science with their fraudulent debunking and intelligence-insulting pseudoscience. As Einstein said, every action has an equal and opposite reaction.\n\n \n I'm afraid it's often mislabeled as fradulent and intelligence insulting, it's often a means of learning that is outside of science.

   "Humanism and atheism are closely related. Richard Dawkins was humanist of the year in 1996 IIRC. Humanism is actually just a term used for word games. It's possible for creationists to seek to utilize all their God given talents. Would that make them \"humanists\"? \n\n \n Humanism is a term frequently used by creationist authors and speakers to articulate what it is they oppose, so hence one of the reasons for my choice of the term here. While I agree with you that they are prone to indulging in word games, their reference to humanism is no accident or attempt to use doublespeak. Perhaps you might consult a reference to familiarise yourself with some of the differences in meaning between atheism and humanism.\n \n \nNot when the advancement is 1+1+1+1 equaling 1000 as I described above. What are the personal goals of those proclaiming the advancement?\n\n \n A picture is far more than a sum of its components..... anyone who has looked at a piece of art can appreciate that point. Likewise, the study of all aspects of natural science has revealed a complex and detailed picture of life on this planet.\n \n As for those who explore I think they are following, more than anything else, an extension of one of our deepest psychological drives- the desire to explain and understand that which we experience.\n \n \nIt's not off the point. What doesn't get as much public funding (or cheering in the news media, or exposure in the classroom, or influence in the courts) is the opposition to a naturalistic, Godless worldview.\n\n \n Okay thats clearer as you did not refer to what it was that didn't get any public funding in your reply before last. Why do you think public money should be made available to reactionary groups who want to nay-say science? Sounds like very poor value for money to me. If they think they are right they can get of their behinds and work hard making their own research proposals and compete for the funding that the scientists all have to work for.\n \n \nShould they not be considered equally valid? Why not? Because you presuppose atheism? Why not give them an equal chance, if they can back up what they say with logic and reason?\n\n \n By what method do they conduct their research? I'd like you to give me an example of on of their papers/articles criticising evolutionary science where they have applied the scientific method vigourously to prove science was in error.\n \n \nI worry about pretend Christians. They can be very effective at promoting atheism.\n\n \n Perhaps its the other way round- it is the dogmatic fundementalists whose blind, literal adherence means they can no longer see just how offensive their views have become to fellow believers, or don't even care anymore.\n \n \nIf it's secular science no, if it's philosophical, atheist science, yes. Open minded people can usually tell them apart.\n\n \n I'd like you to outline just what you mean by:\n \n 1. secular science.\n 2. philosophical, atheist science.\n 3. While you are at it you could tell me about philosophical, secular science too.\n \n I'm open minded see, but you have a habit of, shall we say, flexing the boundaries of meanings so I'd like to hear what you think you are talking about with these terms.",

Huxley said, \"How stupid of me not to have thought of that.\" As pointed out, Alfred Russel Wallace had also developed the theory of natural selection. Even today, we see creationists argue that Darwin stole the idea from someone else, Edward Blyth being the most frequent. Creationists make great noise about the fact that Darwin had indeed read Blyth. What they don't mention is that Darwin read it after the publication of \"Origin.\" Nor do they mention that Darwin had extensive correspondence with Blyth, beginning as early as 1860. Unfortunately, the the correspondence between them has been lost. However, Darwin mentions Blyth frequently in his letters to others and in a letter to Lyell says, \"Blyth says (and he is in many respects a very good judge) that his ideas on species are quite revolutionised...\" by his reading of \"On the Origin of Species.\" Of course, there were the views of Charles Wells and Patrick Matthew.

Both Darwin and Wallace admitted that the economic views of Malthus had given them ideas.\n \n However, is Darwin a prophet? Nonsense. Darwin's works, including \"On the Origin of Species,\" are interesting because of their historical worth, not because of current contribution to evolutionary biology. Are Darwin's works considered scripture? Nonsense. He was shown to be wrong many times. Theory has progressed and Darwin has been corrected and augmented for 150 years. Darwin didn't even know about genetics and never imagined molecular biology, or even population genetics.\n \n Further, Darwin didn't originate the idea of biological evolution.

   "The theory of natural selection has been supported ever since, as have the other 4 theories Darwin developed in \"Origin.\"\n\n \n Okay, let's look at the next \"problem child\" of evolution - \"Natural Selection\" - as a means of generating new species. The assumption of Natural Selection is that since only the strongest and \"most fit\" species survive to father the next generation, the species will gradually improve, even to the point of advancing into other more \"highly\" developed states on the evolutionary scale. Darwin looked upon natural selection as the most important factor in the development of his theory. Another evolutionist by the name of Sir Julian Huxley said, \"So far as we know....natural selection is the only effective agency of evolution\" (Evolution in Action, p. 36). Huxley goes on to state, \"On the basis of our present knowledge natural selection is bound to produce genetic adaptations; and genetic adaptations are thus presumptive evidence for the efficacy of natural selection.\" Did you catch that gem of twisted logic? Huxley's proof for natural selection is genetic adaptations within the species, but these genetic adaptations are at the same time the result of natural selection. So which is it? Does natural selection give rise to genetic adaptation, or does genetic adaptation give rise to natural selection? Huxley contends that both of these things are true at the same time! Surely this is one of the most vacuous examples of circular reasoning to ever be perpetrated in the name of science. Huxley continues with his defense of natural selection by saying, \"....(natural selection) operates with the aid of time to produce improvements in the machinery of life, and in the process generates results of a more than astronomical improbability which could have been achieved in no other way\" (Evolution in Action, p. 54-55). Don't miss the force of that last statement. Huxley states that the odds of natural selection occurring are \"astronomically improbable,\" but because Huxley sees no other way for it to have occurred, he believes in the astronomically improbable! God help us! Huxley even calculated the odds of natural selection occurring in nature as 1 over 10 followed by three million zeros (\"Evolution in Action,\" page 46).  \n \n Now listen to what another evolutionist says regarding natural selection: Dr. Ernst Mayr, considered to be one of the heavyweights in the field of evolution, contends that, \"Natural Selection is no longer regarded as an all-or-none process, but rather as a purely statistical concept\" (Animal Species, p. 7). It is statistical because there is a lack of physical evidence to support it! And G. G. Simpson, another highly regarded interpreter of evolutionary theory, remarks, \"It might be argued that the theory is quite unsubstantiated and has status only as a speculation\" (Major Features, p. 118-119). \n \n \"It goes on, Judah....\" (From Ben Hur).",

Edwards, 482 U.S. at 591-92; McLean, 529 F. Supp. at 1267. First, defense expert Professor Fuller agreed that ID aspires to \"change the ground rules\" of science and lead defense expert Professor Behe admitted that his broadened definition of science, which encompasses ID, would also embrace astrology. (28:26 (Fuller); 21:37-42 (Behe)). Moreover, defense expert Professor Minnich acknowledged that for ID to be considered science, the ground rules of science have to be broadened to allow consideration of supernatural forces. (38:97 (Minnich)).\n \n Prominent IDM leaders are in agreement with the opinions expressed by defense expert witnesses that the ground rules of science must be changed for ID to take hold and prosper. William Dembski, for instance, an IDM leader, proclaims that science is ruled by methodological naturalism and argues that this rule must be overturned if ID is to prosper. (5:32-37 (Pennock)); P-341 at 224 (\"Indeed, entire fields of inquiry, including especially in the human sciences, will need to be rethought from the ground up in terms of intelligent design.\").\n \n The Discovery Institute, the think tank promoting ID whose CRSC developed the Wedge Document, acknowledges as \"Governing Goals\" to \"defeat scientific materialism and its destructive moral, cultural and political legacies\" and \"replace materialistic explanations with the theistic understanding that nature and human beings are created by God.\" (P-140 at 4). In addition, and as previously noted, the Wedge Document states in its \"Five Year Strategic Plan Summary\" that the IDM's goal is to replace science as currently practiced with \"theistic and Christian science.\" Id. at 6.

   "Okay, let's look at the next \"problem child\" of evolution - \"Natural Selection\" - as a means of generating new species.\nGenerating new species is not necessary for either natural selection or evolution. Why change the subject.\n \nThe assumption of Natural Selection is that since only the strongest and \"most fit\" species survive to father the next generation,\nSorry, not an assumption of natural selection.\n \nthe species will gradually improve,\nSorry, not an assumption of natural selection.\n \neven to the point of advancing into other more \"highly\" developed states on the evolutionary scale.\nSorry, not an assumption of natural selection.\n \nDarwin looked upon natural selection as the most important factor in the development of his theory.\nReferences please. The reason I ask is that Darwin developed at least 5 theories in \"On the Origin of Species.\" Natural selection is, as far as I know not a factor of any other theory, but rather a theory in and of itself. Exactly what theory are you talking about when you mention \"his theory?\"\n \nAnother evolutionist by the name of Sir Julian Huxley said, \"So far as we know....natural selection is the only effective agency of evolution\" (Evolution in Action, p. 36).\nBut we have learned more since Huxley wrote that book. There are other agencies of evolution. In fact, Huxley was instrumental in bringing them to light. Huxley was, by the way, a zoologist.\n \nHuxley goes on to state, \"On the basis of our present knowledge natural selection is bound to produce genetic adaptations; and genetic adaptations are thus presumptive evidence for the efficacy of natural selection.\"\nOK. So he is saying that as far as he knew in his day, natural selection will produce genetic adaptations, and we can presume that if we see genetic adaptations in organisms, it is evidence that natural selection has taken place. A bit circular in my view, but we've learned a lot more since Huxley wrote that.\n \nDid you catch that gem of twisted logic? Huxley's proof for natural selection is genetic adaptations within the species, but these genetic adaptations are at the same time the result of natural selection.\nNow you are lying. Huxley said nothing about proof. Why do creationists always have to take quotes out of context to try to make a point. Is that a christian thing?\n \nSo which is it? Does natural selection give rise to genetic adaptation,\nYes.\n \nor does genetic adaptation give rise to natural selection?\nNo. Adaptation is evidence that natural selection has occurred.\n \nHuxley contends that both of these things are true at the same time!\nNo he doesn't. Read it again slowly and try for comprehension this time.\n \nSurely this is one of the most vacuous examples of circular reasoning to ever be perpetrated in the name of science.\nNo. Creationists do it all the time. But we both know that \"creation science\" isn't really science.\n \nHuxley continues with his defense of natural selection by saying, \"....(natural selection) operates with the aid of time to produce improvements in the machinery of life, and in the process generates results of a more than astronomical improbability which could have been achieved in no other way\" (Evolution in Action, p. 54-55).\nAn old fashioned idea that is no longer accepted among evolutionary biologists. There is no necessity that evolution lead to \"improvements.\" I'm not really sure what Huxley was saying (or what you think he was saying) since it is so out of context. That work, like \"Origin\" is of interest more as an historical work than for what it now contributes to evolutionary theory. I would bet that most evolutionary biologists have heard of Huxley, but that few have even read him.\n \nDon't miss the force of that last statement. Huxley states that the odds of natural selection occurring are \"astronomically improbable,\" but because Huxley sees no other way for it to have occurred, he believes in the astronomically improbable!\nYou can't be so simple as to actually believe that your characterization is true! He is not saying that natural selection is impossible. He is saying that natural selection can produce changes that might otherwise be considered improbable.\n \nGod help us!\nAfter your intentional misrepresentation you call on God?\n \nHuxley even calculated the odds of natural selection occurring in nature as 1 over 10 followed by three million zeros (\"Evolution in Action,\" page 46).\nI suspect that your statement is yet another misunderstanding of what Huxley said. Besides, so what? Natural selection has been observed so I guess you and Huxley (if he did say that) are wrong.\n \nNow listen to what another evolutionist says regarding natural selection:\nGreat! Another out of context quote from one of those evil evolutionists.\n \nDr. Ernst Mayr, considered to be one of the heavyweights in the field of evolution, contends that, \"Natural Selection is no longer regarded as an all-or-none process, but rather as a purely statistical concept\" (Animal Species, p. 7).\nIndeed true. Mayr was an ornithologist but he was one of the leading voices of the modern synthesis. Mayr was instrumental in formulating the biological species concept. The idea of natural selection as a statistical process is the current statement of natural selection. Natural selection is the differential reproductive success of organisms with beneficial genetic characteristics over those organisms that have less beneficial characteristics. It is well understood that the former may die before reproduction while the later may live to reproduce.\n \nIt is statistical because there is a lack of physical evidence to support it!\nThat's nonsense. Natural selection is so well accepted that even young earth creationists accept it. They found that it was necessary in order to get millions of species from the few thousand that could have fit on their ark.\n \nAnd G. G. Simpson, another highly regarded interpreter of evolutionary theory, remarks, \"It might be argued that the theory is quite unsubstantiated and has status only as a speculation\" (Major Features, p. 118-119).\nNot familiar with that quote but I suspect that it is out of context and that Simpson went on to point out that such argument would be incorrect. Simpson was a vertebrate paleontologist.\n \n I have several questions.\n \n 1. Why do you think that the work of these men in the formulation of the modern synthesis has overwhelming importance in biology today? They worked when genetics was in its infancy, when there was no such thing as molecular biology or population genetics. Their work laid the foundation. In other words, why do you think that quoting from works that were written before most on this board were even born should carry weight in a very quickly advancing intellectual environment such as evolutionary biology?\n \n 2. Why do you feel that the dishonest technique of taking quotes out of context makes valid points when you can offer no science to support your views?\n \n 3. Why don't you learn to correctly cite what you quote? For example,\n \n Mayr, E. 1963. Animal Species and Evolution. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA. p. 7.\n \n Simpson, G.G 1953. The Major Features of Evolution. Columbia University Press, New York. pp 118-119.\n \n The above two references were taken from a text on evolutionary biology. The book by Huxley isn't even referenced. How much weight do you think it actually has today in evolutionary biology?",

   "Humanism is a term frequently used by creationist authors and speakers to articulate what it is they oppose, so hence one of the reasons for my choice of the term here. While I agree with you that they are prone to indulging in word games, their reference to humanism is no accident or attempt to use doublespeak. \n\n \n You misunderstood, it's not creationists who usually indulge in word games. They use humanism because it can be one of the best, non offensive words to refer to non creationists. If one is referred to as an atheist, the cry is often \"I'm not an atheist, I'm agnostic!\" Or \"I'm not a humanist, I'm a freethinker!\" Or, \"I'm not a Darwinist, I'm an evolutionist!\" It goes on and on. Non creationists don't want to take a firm position the same way non conservatives don't.\n \n \nPerhaps you might consult a reference to familiarise yourself with some of the differences in meaning between atheism and humanism. \n\n \n I have. One disregards God, the other says there is no God. Very little difference.\n \n \n \nA picture is far more than a sum of its components..... anyone who has looked at a piece of art can appreciate that point. Likewise, the study of all aspects of natural science has revealed a complex and detailed picture of life on this planet.\n \n As for those who explore I think they are following, more than anything else, an extension of one of our deepest psychological drives- the desire to explain and understand that which we experience.\n\n \n Or that other deep, psychological drive - to free themselves from moral absolutes and accountability.\n \n \n \nOkay thats clearer as you did not refer to what it was that didn't get any public funding in your reply before last. Why do you think public money should be made available to reactionary groups who want to nay-say science? \n\n \n I never said public money should be \"made available\" to anyone. I object to it's availability to reactionary groups who want to nay-say religion in this country's tradition. \n \n \n Sounds like very poor value for money to me. If they think they are right they can get of their behinds and work hard making their own research proposals and compete for the funding that the scientists all have to work for.\n\n \n That has to come from the education establishment along with the new minds of future generations. It can't happen when certain thought processes are outlawed from schools by the courts.\n \n \n \nBy what method do they conduct their research? I'd like you to give me an example of on of their papers/articles criticising evolutionary science where they have applied the scientific method vigourously to prove science was in error. \n\n \n http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&id=3122\n \n Gather up 10, 20, however many of all your helpers here that you'll need to tee off on this one - I'm as ready as I'll ever be. \n \n \n \n \nPerhaps its the other way round- it is the dogmatic fundementalists whose blind, literal adherence means they can no longer see just how offensive their views have become to fellow believers, or don't even care anymore.\n\n \n Not caring is much more innocent than pretending to be something you're not. \n \n \n \nI'd like you to outline just what you mean by:\n \n 1. secular science. \n\n \n Non controversial study, study of the present, with use of our five senses. The boiling point of water - the melting point of lead, etc. \n \n \n \n2. philosophical, atheist science.\n 3. While you are at it you could tell me about philosophical, secular science too. \n\n \n That would be study which starts with the presupposition that since we live in a realm of rearrangement, that's all there can be, and everything has to be defined by rearrangement. Combining observation and experiment with a naturalistic philosophy. \n \n \n \nI'm open minded see, but you have a habit of, shall we say, flexing the boundaries of meanings so I'd like to hear what you think you are talking about with these terms.\n\n \n You're open minded about WHAT? emoticon_xangel \n \n \n \n \n \nFourth, science knows it has much more political power if man is nothing more than an animal. \n \n \n \n \nThis I find confusing. \n\n \n A lot of political issues in the U.S. - abortion, cloning, medical experimentation, and the ethics involved in all those things. It is said that religion deals in hope and fear. Science (and atheism) can deal with hope and fear as well. You'd understand it better if you lived here. (not intended to be offensive)\n \n \n \nFifth, science can get more funding now for more expeditions. \n\n \n \n \nPersonally I'm interested to see what we might find inbetween Tiktaalik and Acanthostega/Ichtheostega. \n\n \n Some taxpaying Americans are more interested in keeping their money so they can EAT. (that WAS intended to be offensive) :p \n \n \n \nSixth, it's better insurance to keep ID out of schools, to keep students from asking too many questions. \n\n \n \n \nNot really, but if ID did get into schools thats when the students would stop asking the questions. \n\n \n So only one viewpoint inspires more questions than two opposing viewpoints?? If all of us in this thread agreed on atheism, this thread would be longer??\n \n \n \nSeventh, it gets closer to establishing atheism, no matter what the first amendment says. \n \n \n \n \nWhy can atheism not be established in the US? I thought everybody was supposed to be free to follow their own beliefs without interference from the State? \n\n \n That's it exactly! If one belief is established, (atheism is a belief) then other beliefs would be interferred with by the State!\n __________________",

   "This reply is so muddled and evasive I hardly know where to start. Palaeontology has nothing to do with 'human nature and written history', and palaeontologists make no reference to such matters in their findings. And yet somehow, by your reckoning, they are deliberately effecting a confrontation with them. \n\n \n As we see from this link, palaeontology was originated by a Christian, Nicholaus Steno.\n \n http://www.edinburghgeolsoc.org/z_41_02.html\n \n \nThe book's rather obscure title gives no inkling of the wealth of ideas and observations which it contains. Under the general heading of 'solids contained within solids', Steno includes fossils, agates and crystals in rocks and also the strata which form the earth's crust in Tuscany: a typical bed lies between higher and lower beds and so may be regarded as enclosed. No summary of the Prodromus can convey the concentrated brilliance of the work and Steno's style of writing is so precise and economical that it is difficult to summarise without significant loss. There are few superfluous words. Steno never indulged in the unsupported speculation so common amongst his contemporaries but went into the country to study the rocks themselves and deserves to be regarded as the first field geologist. The outline of selected topics which follows is given in an attempt to convey the breadth and importance of this monumental work. \n\n \n Palaeontology started out secular, a study of material in the here and now using five senses in the present. It's 21st century definition shows that it, like much (but not all) of science has evolved into little more than atheist propaganda. \n \n \n \n \nPalaeontology is the empirical study of ancient life forms as revealed by the fossil record - no more, no less. If creationists insist that its findings conflict with their beliefs, that is a battle of their choosing. Yes, in post #2 my first reaction to the Tiktaalik find was a reference to the problems it generated for creationists - but they are the ones who have put themselves in the frame with their insistence, contrary to all the evidence, that transitional fossils do not exist.\n \n Tell me, marc: in your view, should the study of palaeontology be forbidden?\n\n \n It shouldn't be forbidden, but since it's largely a public endeavor, it should be policed by the political process - not by scientists alone, and not by courts alone.",

   "It is second nature to religious believers to invest the highest authority in the sayings of sacred texts or charismatic individuals, whose word they regard as infallbile. This, indeed, is often the only ultimate fall-back position from which a particular religious opinion can be defended, and to believers it is sufficient.\n \n Because their own belief system works in this way, when believers find themselves in debate with non-believers, they naturally tend to project that way of thinking onto their opponents, assuming that their opinions too depend for their validity on the utterances of authority figures. We used to see a lot of nonsense on creationist websites about Darwin being evolution's 'prophet' and Origin of Species its 'holy book', as though if Darwin had never lived, or Origin never been written, the theory would never have come into existence. \n \n \n Scientific authority, of course, derives not from the views of eminent individuals but from the weight of empirical evidence. Marc, however, seems still to take the view that if he can only get in a shot at the Revered Leader (that's irony, marc) the rest of us will be in disarray. \n\n \n Leaders in atheism can be different, at different times for different people. Sometimes an individual like Dawkins, sometimes a group like talkorigins, some would say the leader is Satan himself. The leader is ultimately a worldview - an intense desire for no absolute truth concerning morals or accountablility. \n \n \n \n \nNever mind that marc has taken a quote out of context. What matters is that on this occasion Dawkins was wrong. Evolution most emphatically has been observed - is being observed today - while it is happening. Emergence of new plant species through allopolyploidy is very well documented. Virtually every degree of postzygotic and prezygotic genetic isolation predictable by theory is observable in South American fruit fly populations.\n \n Dawkins is an eminent evolutionary biologist, marc, and he says and writes a lot of insightful things. However, he is not, for all your 'sheep' jibes, regarded by evolutionists or atheists (two distinct sets) as some kind of infallible leader. On this occasion what he said was untrue. It's as simple as that.\n\n \n There can be no doubt that Dawkins would love to agree with you about these \"observations\". It's probably safe to say he's had a lot more experience in debating credentialed ID proponents than you have, and knows he can't get by with it.",

It's human nature to apply the vocation we're most interested in, and practice, to determine our worldview. It's human nature to consider the vocation we're in as the most important one concerning the knowledge we use to run our lives. Doctors and lawyers can also have that problem. It reminds me of a controversy in the news about 20 years ago. DOCTORS recommended that school buses have seat belts on them, because they knew how injuries happened to the human body when it did, or did not have a seat belt on it in a crash. The news media trumped that up greatly, as if doctors opinions were the only ones that mattered in this case. But doctors didn't give much thought to the fact that most school bus deaths happened in the boarding and departing proceedure, when seat belts weren't worn. Doctors didn't give much thought to the fact that passing cars with impatient drivers were the main reasons for the boarding and departing deaths. Impatient drivers that would grow more impatient with the traffic delays that students fumbling with seat belts would cause. Doctors didn't have experience with human behavior, and many other details of a bus ride that figure greatly in which decision was the best one. \n \n Saying doctors should be the ultimate authority on school bus seat belts is like giving scientists the most authority to determine if ID is true or false. Ordained ministers and pastors get a lot more exposure to human nature, human behavior, and they get a good look at how it compares with the law of the Old Testament, and the Gospel of the New Testament. Just because science doesn't examine human behavior (or mathematics, or many other things) to the same extent that other professions do doesn't mean they aren't important in indicating whether we were created or not.

I think that the clergymen that I have known were better Christians than you. Also, more educated in the history and the theology of Christianity than you.\n It has nothing to do with belief in the Bible. It has to do with a failure to educate oneself in the history and the sources of the Bible.\n\n \n If there's ever a prize for word games on these forums, your statement that I highlighted above would have to take it. SO IT'S POSSIBLE TO BELIEVE IN A CREATOR, YET NOT BE A CREATIONIST, ACCORDING TO YOU. \n \n It's no wonder naturalistic evolution is an \"established\" fact. Evolutionists seem to really have a way with words.\n \n If the ordained ministers and pastors that you knew believed in God as creator, (BUT WERE NOT CREATIONISTS, DARN IT) do they believe in naturalistic evolution? Do they believe that life originated from water as evolutionists seem to favor more and more, and also that man was formed from the \"dust of the ground\" as the Bible says?

The latter two are also based on a methodological assumption of naturalism to study and explain the natural world, without assuming the existence or nonexistence of the supernatural. \n\n \n The link in the opening post of this thread does not do that. It assumes the nonexistence of the supernatural. Neutrality concerning the supernatural is almost non-existant in scientific study about the past. The link in this thread is typical of the slant you'll see in most newspapers and other news reports about scientific findings. \n \n \n (finishing that paragraph)\n \n In this view, it is held both religiously and scientifically correct to reinterpret ancient religious texts in line with modern-day scientific findings about evolution. \n\n \n Does \"reinterpret\" mean, throw them out?

It's also important to note that Theistic Evolution adds onto the traditional definition in the following way: Evolution is gradual change, caused/initiated and/or controlled by God.\n \n However, neither of the above two definitions of evolution are necessarily the entire extent.

   "Hello electrolyte - you created yourself an imaginary friend? emoticon_confused \n \n \n \nYes, Marc: Evidence. The argument is over whether or not science has the capacity to measure the supernatural, not whether the supernatural actually exists. \n\n \n I don't think that's what the argument is over at all. The declaration is constantly made on these forums and elsewhere that the supernatural is not science. Science makes no claim that they can measure it - they only seek to measure and study naturalism. When creationists claim that there are too many gaps for naturalistic evolution to be true, \"science\" attempts to fill those gaps to try to prove creationism untrue. That's how this thread was started.\n \n \nGranted, I'm certain there are threads on here that attempt to show how religion in some instances does not work out (ie: the Great Flood), but those are not arguments against theism entirely. This comes down to everyone's personal interpretation of this argument, I suppose, but I haven't seen very much to suggest that the majority of evolutionists on this board believe science is capable of proving nor disproving the possibility of a deity. \n\n \n I have, and I believe this thread is one of many proofs of it.\n \n \n \n \nWhat does the 2LoT have to do with Theistic Evolution? \n\n \n It has to do with change over time, as does the word \"evolution\".\n \n \nAnd, on that note, what exactly is your point? Are you trying to show the foolishness of someone else in using water and ice as an example of entropy, or did you actually forget that ice often times melts? \n\n \n My point is that the definition of evolution is so confusing that it's sometimes not possible to debate a clever atheist about it in a concise, readable way. \n \n \n \nHowever, neither of the above two definitions of evolution are necessarily the entire extent. It depends on how deep into the explanation of evolution you want to go. You could write a 500-page textbook on the definition of the ToE, and perhaps even then it may not be fully adequate. \n\n \n Kind of like the tax code, isn't it? The ToE doesn't really need to be that way, UNLESS you have a scientific interest in politics, and creationism provides roadblocks to political activity. \n \n \n \nOf course its countless. Everyone on Earth has their own specific definition of all sorts of words. You could interview thousands of people, and they'd all have varying opinions over the shade of color that separates \"blue\" from \"indigo,\" despite the clear explanation left in the dictionary. \n\n \n But there's almost no other word that has so much political influence, with such varying definitions, as the word evolution.\n \n \nI also do not understand what you hope to gain by dragging in the title. The title fails to explain exactly what angle of each topic is being debated, which is exactly what you extrapolated upon. \n\n \n The title explains the general nature of the topic - creation vs. non creation, the word evolution in this context, means there is no God. It's not a mistake of this board, its a common headline for the debate.\n \n \nThe angle of Creationism that is being debated is whether literal biblical descriptions of the creation of the earth is scientifically possible, \n\n \n I agree. If the Bible is to be dismantled, it must be done a step at a time. \n \n \n \nwhile the angle of Intelligent Design that is being debated is whether ID constitutes science-not whether ID is possible. \n\n \n That debate is pretty well over - the courts have awarded that one to science. Science still seems very nervous about it however.\n \n \n \n \nOh please. People aren't dancing around you by supplying a different definition of evolution every time-you merely aren't looking for the blatant consistency in everyone's explanation. No, as much as it may surprise you, people don't copy the definition out of the same textbook every time they write what the ToE means to them. \n\n \n No they don't copy it out of the same textbook since one textbook wouldn't hold them all - they plug in whatever definition they need according to the nature of the debate.\n \n \n \n \n\"99% of scientists... are not theistic evolutionists...\"\n \n Wrong. Moving on... \n\n \n I agree that it's wrong. Your alter ego says otherwise;\n \n \nIf anyone with a biology or biology-related degree is credentialed in ID, and 99.9+% of all scientists working in a biology-related field reject ID, then nearly all \"credentialed-in-ID\" scientists reject ID...\n \n It's cool to know that I'm \"credentialed in ID,\" though.\n\n \n \n \n \nYeah, so? The existence of the supernatural is inconsequential to their scientific field. A deity could exist, and evolution would still occur, same as it would without a deity. There's no mention of the possibility or impossibility of a deity mentioned in the scientific reports on the ToE. You make it sound as if scientists summarize their conclusions with a solid, \"therefore, because Specie X has been observed to evolve to Specie Y, a supernatural deity obviously cannot exist.\" That's not the case.\n\n \n That IS the case. \"A supernatural deity cannot exist\" is the theme of most \"scientific\" websites. Talk origins makes it as clear as any of them.\n \n \n \nPandion's already answered your question. A person is not a creationist-in the sense of the traditional term often used in this debate-if they do not accept the literal interpretation of Genesis. \n\n \n That's right - the definition of the word \"creationist\" is being narrowed in the same way that the definition of evolution has been expanded. It's often the only way that atheism can win arguments. I've made my point on Pandion's \"answer\" - anyone who is open minded can see how laughable it is that one can believe in creation, yet not be a creationist.\n \n \n \n \nWould you care to show how it contradicts another definition of Evolution or another definition of the Theory of Evolution, instead of simply being a clarification you may not have taken into account before? \n\n \n When two people are debating \"creation vs. evolution\", and one side claims that evolution has been observed, then they can also make the claim that creation has NOT been observed, therefore evolution is true, and creationism is false. Two distinct definitions of the word evolution, and it's difficult for the one arguing for creation to point it out in a readable, concise way. If a third party is observing, it often has a short attention span. Evolutionists (atheists) are masters at \"changing the audience's sentiments instead of their minds.\"\n \n \n \n \nOkie dokie. The morals taught by Jesus like generosity and honesty all depend on whether God made the earth in six days by \"poofing\" it, or if He utilized scientific processes that took billions of years, instead.

   "If something is modified, does it not become better, or more complex? There's nothing wrong with those terms, unless you're a degreed scientist who is talking down to common peasants. \n \n\n \n No. It becomes different. However, sometimes it makes an organism be able to better survive/reproduce in specific environmental conditions, or perhaps less so. Most of the time, it doesn't matter one way or another. WHen a modification allows an organism to better survive/reproduce in a specific environment, then that 'trait' gets passed on a bit more. When it reduces survivial /reproduction, then that trait is 'selected against'. It does not neccesiarily have to be 'better', or 'more complex'. It can even be simpler. \n \n For example, in deep caves, many species lose their ability to have functioning eyes. In the darkness of the caves, the eyes are not a survival characteristic.. since there is no light to see. However, a fully functional eye\n will take more energy, and therefore when it is disables through mutation, the \n 'blindness' is selected FOR, because it uses less energy for the individual. IN an environment that there is more light, being able to detect light and see is a survivial characteristic that more than makes up for the extra energ it takes to operate. The organism in the cave is 'simpler', but change the enviornment and bring it to a light environment, it can not avoid predators that can see.",

But why change the subject? No one is saying that evolution is guided, just that it isn't random.\n \nThe actual mechanism of natural selection occurs based or random adaptations to random circumstances.\nWhile mutation, gene flow, recombination, and genetic drift may be largely random, sexual selection and natural selection are not. Likewise, climate changes that produce changes in environment, or periods of stasis that maintain environments for long periods of time may be random. However, natural selection, only one of the mechanisms that cause evolution, is not. You seem to have a murkey idea of what natural selection is. It is the differential reproductive success of those organisms that have more adaptive genetic characteristics. As symbiote mentioned, it is statistical. Better adapted organisms produce more offspring and therefore become more common. Not guided in the sense that you mean, but not random either.\n \nAlthough generalisations can be made about the possible product of natural selection, the fossil record shows us that many forms wierd and wonderful will emerge in a way that is not inherently predictable.\nBut being predictable isn't the point. Again, symbiote has already pointed out that certain predictions can be made. But we can't predict in every detail what sort of genetic variability will be present and what effect it will have on adapibility in any given environment. But we can work backwards. Morphology gives indications of physiology, and that tells us a lot about the environment.\n \nI think I know what you mean though, as natural selection will always apply exactly to the environment in which it occurs, and will therefore appear to be (while not directed) linear.\nNo. It will be adaptive. Therefore, natural selection is not random. It appears linear in the same way that a drunken walk in linear.",

   "Hello marc9000, I hope the hiatus in our debate was not to long. To business:\n \n \nYou misunderstood, it's not creationists who usually indulge in word games.\n\n \n Thats not a misunderstanding, but a difference of opinion.\n \n \nThey use humanism because it can be one of the best, non offensive words to refer to non creationists. If one is referred to as an atheist, the cry is often \"I'm not an atheist, I'm agnostic!\" Or \"I'm not a humanist, I'm a freethinker!\" Or, \"I'm not a Darwinist, I'm an evolutionist!\" It goes on and on. Non creationists don't want to take a firm position the same way non conservatives don't.\n\n \n I'd say there are differences between an atheist, agnostic, humanist and a freethinker, and also between a Darwinist and and a [modern] evolutionist. People like to have their outlooks described accurately- much in the same way a member of the Greek Orthodox Church will be unimpressed if you refer to them as a Catholic, and vice-versa.\n \n \nI have. One disregards God, the other says there is no God. Very little difference.\n\n \n Only in your black and white outlook.\n \n \nOr that other deep, psychological drive - to free themselves from moral absolutes and accountability.\n\n \n But no, I think it is the curisoity. After all, it is that same desire to understand that gave us religion- all thats changed is our background understanding of the world we exist in with the contempory scientific view. You might also say its reminded alot of Christians not to read poetic allegory as historical fact ;)\n \n \nI never said public money should be \"made available\" to anyone. I object to it's availability to reactionary groups who want to nay-say religion in this country's tradition. \n\n \n So you are now saying publicly funded scientific research is reactionary and conducted with the purpose of attacking religion? I find that to be an arguement with as much strength as wet tissue paper.\n \n Also, could you explain exactly how you would determine what sciences are \"reactionary groups who want to nay-say religion\"?\n \n \nThat has to come from the education establishment along with the new minds of future generations. It can't happen when certain thought processes are outlawed from schools by the courts.\n\n \n Separation of religion from State? I thought you were all in favour of that! But my point stands- there are plenty of allegedly scientific creationist researchers out there- there are even plenty of actual scientists among them. So why can they not put together a research proposal to challenge the science of evolution from a YEC viewpoint, ID viewpoint etc? I suggest it is because any such work would not be scientific because, at some level, it suspends the need to examine further and instead fillls a gap in understanding with an assumption of faith.\n \n \nGather up 10, 20, however many of all your helpers here that you'll need to tee off on this one - I'm as ready as I'll ever be. \n\n \n That article just demonstrates the authors ignorance of what life is in scientific terms as well as constructing a strawman arguement based around the 2nd law of thermodynamics. Life is reverse entropy- it is the temporary imposition of order onto otherwise chaotic matter.\n \n Also notable is the authors assumption that evolutionary trends should make sense to us. That is an utterly fallicious outlook- the trends of evolution are often strange and defy superficial assumptions people make. Returning to our topic matter of Tiklaaik is an excellent example of this. Digit bearing limbs did not evolve to allow animals to walk on land but were adaptations to a specialised aquatic existance. Subsequently, these structures have been adapted to terrestrial locomotion.\n \n \nNot caring is much more innocent than pretending to be something you're not. \n\n \n I disagree- and I think you would find Christianity takes a pretty dim view of both.\n \n \nNon controversial study, study of the present, with use of our five senses. The boiling point of water - the melting point of lead, etc. \n\n \n Fortunately for all of us science as a whole has not put itself in such a straight jacket of scope. What exactly is \"the present\" anyway?\n \n \nThat would be study which starts with the presupposition that since we live in a realm of rearrangement, that's all there can be, and everything has to be defined by rearrangement. Combining observation and experiment with a naturalistic philosophy. \n\n \n A naturalistic philosophy underpins all modern science, so I guess there is no more medical research funding when you are in control. The presupposition you infer is a conclusion drawn from previous studies and has stood up to repeated challenges from other scientific studies. But like I said above, you can construct a study to test the scientific validity of aspects of evolution etc.\n \n \nYou're open minded about WHAT? emoticon_xangel\n\n \n I am open minded about WHAT? emoticon_xangel \n \n \nA lot of political issues in the U.S. - abortion, cloning, medical experimentation, and the ethics involved in all those things. It is said that religion deals in hope and fear. Science (and atheism) can deal with hope and fear as well. You'd understand it better if you lived here. (not intended to be offensive)\n\n \n Well I appreciate that religion plays a big part in US politics but should atheism, a valid belief hel by some people have no representation at all?\n \n \nSome taxpaying Americans are more interested in keeping their money so they can EAT. (that WAS intended to be offensive) :p \n\n \n Well it didn't work. I'd also suggest that if capital expenditure on research and endevour is your bug-bear you are looking up the wrong tree. I'd start with the sequoia-sized one just behind you with the NASA fruit on it ;)\n \n \nSo only one viewpoint inspires more questions than two opposing viewpoints?? If all of us in this thread agreed on atheism, this thread would be longer??\n\n \n We might actually be debating the finer scientific details of the nature article.......... there is certainly more than one viewpoint to be considered there.\n \n \nThat's it exactly! If one belief is established, (atheism is a belief) then other beliefs would be interferred with by the State!\n __________________\n\n \n Isn't the separation of Church and state supposed to create a non-theistic apparatus of state in which all people can follow their own beliefs (be it Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Sikh, Agnositc, Atheist or Disciple of the Noodly Appendage) without the imposition of other beliefs, however subtle via the State?",

   "\n \nWhat does the 2LoT have to do with Theistic Evolution? \n\n \n It has to do with change over time, as does the word \"evolution\".\n\n \n I'm still lost. It specifically disproves Theistic Evolution how? The same way it 'disproves' the 'normal' ToE?\n \n \n\n \nAnd, on that note, what exactly is your point? Are you trying to show the foolishness of someone else in using water and ice as an example of entropy, or did you actually forget that ice often times melts?\n\n \n My point is that the definition of evolution is so confusing that it's sometimes not possible to debate a clever atheist about it in a concise, readable way.\n\n \n Okay, and when Christians like Kenneth R. Miller present the same amount of 'definitions', it must be completely understandable. Here's what you don't seem to understand: \n \n \"Change of life over time through genetic mutations\" is probably the most watered-down definition of Evolution you can hope to see, but that doesn't change any of the facts about Evolution. When people clarify and say, \"Evolution is a scientific theory,\" they aren't redefining Evolution. Evolution is part of a broader definition called a scientific theory.\n \n \n\n \nNow what are you talking about. Since evolution has been observed, yes, it is a fact. The theory of evolution is the scientific explanation of why it happens. \n\n \n Evolution definition number 389256.\n\n \n Not only is that a true definition that I've come across many times before and written many times myself, but it doesn't change anything in the 'initial' definition of evolution.\n \n You're more than smart enough to sift through any confusion that might arise when multiple people are debating at the same time. Don't, however, pretend anyone's trying to change the subject or move the goal posts on you.\n \n \n \n Kind of like the tax code, isn't it? The ToE doesn't really need to be that way, UNLESS you have a scientific interest in politics, and creationism provides roadblocks to political activity.\n\n \n Evolution is nowhere near the most confusing scientific theory. When you call for responses from people that provide clarifications, it's because you just aren't getting the issue.\n \n \n \n The title explains the general nature of the topic - creation vs. non creation, the word evolution in this context, means there is no God. It's not a mistake of this board, its a common headline for the debate.\n\n \n Again, fine extrapolation on your part. I see now \"non creation\" in the title. I see \"evolution.\" Not that the title, which was made by the administrators, even matters, for the second time.\n \n \n \n I agree. If the Bible is to be dismantled, it must be done a step at a time.\n\n \n Only if the Bible is to be dismantled, but that doesn't happen. Genesis is almost strictly the only section ever attacked by non-YEC's, to show simply the foolishness in taking everything the Bible says literally. On the other hand, to show the Bible is false, one need disprove only one single sentence in the Bible, not the whole thing as you seem to believe people are obsessed with doing.\n \n \n That debate is pretty well over - the courts have awarded that one to science. Science still seems very nervous about it however.\n\n \n This is because, unlike you, most ID'ists don't agree that the debate is over.\n \n \n No they don't copy it out of the same textbook since one textbook wouldn't hold them all - they plug in whatever definition they need according to the nature of the debate.\n\n \n Says you. It's merely due to the ignorance of their opponent, not a different-colored Ace up their sleeve.\n \n \n \n I agree that it's wrong. Your alter ego says otherwise;\n\n \n No idea what you're talking about in respect to my alter ego. At any rate, you're wrong. There are thousands upon thousands of theistic evolutionists all over the world. Also note that your citation of Electrolyte does not prove your point:\n \n  If anyone with a biology or biology-related degree is credentialed in ID, and 99.9+% of all scientists working in a biology-related field reject ID, then nearly all \"credentialed-in-ID\" scientists reject ID...\n \n Why does it fail in proving yoru point? For starters, ID and Theistic Evolution are not the same thing, though you could say they share the same fundamental belief that there is a higher force that created the first life. The most significant difference between the two, however, is that one claims it is science, while the other does not. Kenneth Miller, the theistic evolutionist from Brown University that everyone knows about, is not an ID'ist. He accepts Theistic Evolution, but not Intelligent Design. (However, for the purpose of avoiding any out-of-context quote you might accidentally pull, Miller does not accept the 'theistic' twist of Evolution on any scientific ground. It's his faith that adds on the 'theistic' part.)\n \n \n That IS the case. \"A supernatural deity cannot exist\" is the theme of most \"scientific\" websites. Talk origins makes it as clear as any of them.\n\n \n Re-read what I said, please:\n \n  There's no mention of the possibility or impossibility of a deity mentioned in the scientific reports on the ToE. You make it sound as if scientists summarize their conclusions with a solid, \"therefore, because Specie X has been observed to evolve to Specie Y, a supernatural deity obviously cannot exist.\" That's not the case.\n \n Talkorigins.org, while it is run by professional scientists, and while some of its material is scientifically-published material, is not a scientific report website. I'm talking about peer-reviewed scientific journals, not sites that argue one point or another with whatever evidence they can find. And, to repeat what I said above, you will not find one peer-reviewed scientific journal that says the supernatural has been disproved. All scientists have personal opinions on the existence of a god, from astrophysicists to zoologists, but they don't publish any of those opinions in their professional work.\n \n Think of it this way:\n \n Tax attorneys don't muddle their case files with postulations on the existence of God; astrophysicists who study Gravity don't muddle their scientific reports with postulations on the existence of God; biologists who study Evolution don't muddle their scientific reports with postulations on the existence of God either.\n \n Talkorigins.org is much more like a website that talks about an angle of lawsuits over tax returns than it is a collection of actual lawsuits over tax returns.\n \n Try again, Marc. Talkorigins.org is not a viable example of a scientific report that tries to disprove religion.\n \n \n That's right - the definition of the word \"creationist\" is being narrowed in the same way that the definition of evolution has been expanded. It's often the only way that atheism can win arguments. I've made my point on Pandion's \"answer\" - anyone who is open minded can see how laughable it is that one can believe in creation, yet not be a creationist.\n\n \n Marc, it really doesn't matter what the word definitions come down to, as I've already tried to explain. You're overlooking the point and reading way too deep in-between the lines. People-scientists and others alike-accept both Evolution and the Bible.\n \n \n Would you care to show how it contradicts another definition of Evolution or another definition of the Theory of Evolution, instead of simply being a clarification you may not have taken into account before?\n\n \n When two people are debating \"creation vs. evolution\", and one side claims that evolution has been observed, then they can also make the claim that creation has NOT been observed, therefore evolution is true, and creationism is false.\n\n \n I'm lost. You added on another irrelevant and incorrect clause to what we're talking about. Just because something hasn't been observed, it doesn't mean that it's false. I've never seen my stomach first hand, but it's still there.\n \n \nTwo distinct definitions of the word evolution, and it's difficult for the one arguing for creation to point it out in a readable, concise way. If a third party is observing, it often has a short attention span. Evolutionists (atheists) are masters at \"changing the audience's sentiments instead of their minds.\"\n\n \n No. That is not the case with the \"additional definitions\" you responded to. They were clarifications, and they were obviously not intended to \"change the audience's sentiments.\" I don't even see how a quiet audience's opinion matters in the first place. I'm not here to convince some guest's mind. Maybe you are, but I'm not. They were given because you don't understand what evolution is in the context of a scientific theory. \n \n Also, what are the \"two distinct definitions\" of Evolution you speak of?\n \n \n I say so, because there is a whole lot more to the Bible than generosity and honesty.\n\n \n That's my point. There's a lot more to the Bible than whether we were made in six days or millions of years.\n \n \nUntrue. Scientific websites make no attempt to keep them separate. Read the \"feedback\" section at talkorigins sometime.\n\n \n I didn't say they were trying to keep them separate! I said Science and Religion answer different questions! You can still combine the answers. It's not always enough to know how the suspect committed the crime. In some cases, you need the motive-the why.\n \n \n Is it biology / physics, or philosophical / observable?\n\n \n Biology and physics are observable; philosophy usually isn't. Perhaps you could explain what that has to do with what you quoted from me:\n \n  At any rate, yes, it is related, because you're attacking the scientists who reconcile their faith with biology, but not those who reconcile faith with physics.",

   "\n You claimed it was the most valuable tool \"atheism\" uses in debating. Although you're wrong about it, you think that evolution is all but synonymous with atheism; if I'm arguing for evolution (i.e. \"atheism\" to you) without repeatedly mentioning the word in question, and you're squirming to the point of making false accusations, lying, denying the existence of theistic evolutionists, and misrepresenting websites, the other tactics must be pretty effective. (That, or you're forced to admit that evolution isn't atheistic.) \n\n \n YOU denied the existance of theistic scientists in post #130.\n \n \n \nAs far as I know, talkorigins doesn't have a faith statement. \n\n \n But you can get an idea of what their faith is - this is from one of their administrators, in the feedback section;\n \n \nCreationists lie. They always lie, they lie worse than politicians, they lie worse than used car salesmen, they lie when their argument is weakened by a lie. The entire story you presented was a lie. There was no instance in which a body wearing modern shoes was ever sampled for C14 dating. Are we supposed to be so stupid that we are to believe that after a radiocarbon sample is submitted, the carcass was just suddenly revealed to be wearing shoes? A body is not just \"found\" to be wearing shoes. Is anyone this stupid? I question that this story has any factual basis at all. Is this a teacher? Was there a student? \n\n \n Maybe they should make that their faith statement. (This is from March 06, about halfway down.)\n \n \n \n \nBelfrey mentioned the ASA in post 153, and you claimed that you'd check them out. It is painfully clear now that you didn't check too thoroughly.\n\n \n Post 153, yes, that was the \"until now\" that I was talking about. When they're used as references for evolutionary comments here, I'll check them out as necessary.\n \n \n \nNo, it doesn't support your position at all. \n\n \n It does support my position, because it shows how just about all comments about the site center on the creation controversy. You said in post #160 that it's \"ridiculous to claim evolution is necessarily atheistic\". The fact that TO's feedback focuses almost exclusivly on it, and the rant from the TO administrator that I showed above, shows that it really is necessarily atheistic.\n \n \nThe TO Feedback section includes emails and comments sent in from people ranging from nutjobs and pranksters to the well-educated. Some comments from anti-evolutionists state that evolution is atheistic, but certain responses by talkorigins contributors specifically refute your claim. \n\n \n They didn't refute it at all - they were just further attacks on creationists. \n \n \n \nYour comment shows either that you don't know what you're talking about regarding talkorigins, or that you do know what you're talking about and are being purposely disingenuous and misleading. You can let us know which is the case.\n\n \n Let's look at another part of talkorigins, to prove another point that I've made recently. I've stated that science isn't the only source of knowledge.\n \n \n.....This is inexcusable for a dictionary of science. Not only does this definition exclude prokaryotes, protozoa, and fungi, but it specifically includes a term \"gradual process\" which should not be part of the definition. More importantly the definition seems to refer more to the history of evolution than to evolution itself. Using this definition it is possible to debate whether evolution is still occurring, but the definition provides no easy way of distinguishing evolution from other processes. For example, is the increase in height among Caucasians over the past several hundred years an example of evolution? Are the color changes in the peppered moth population examples of evolution? This is not a scientific definition. \n Standard dictionaries are even worse. \n \n \n \"evolution: ...the doctrine according to which higher forms of life have gradually arisen out of lower..\" - Chambers \n \"evolution: ...the development of a species, organism, or organ from its original or primitive state to its present or specialized state; phylogeny or ontogeny\" - Webster's \n \n \n These definitions are simply wrong. Unfortunately it is common for non-scientists to enter into a discussion about evolution with such a definition in mind. This often leads to fruitless debate since the experts are thinking about evolution from a different perspective. \n\n \n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolution-definition.html\n \n Talkorigins has been around since...1998 (the best I can tell) Merriam-Webster dictionary has been around since 1831. Yet talkorigins proclaims that they know better how to define words. Their reasoning, is that they know how science works, so they should better know how to define the term. The truth is, Webster's knows better how the term is used in society, how it's referred to by EVERYONE for communication purposes, not just scientists. What would prevent talkorigins from attempting to supersede Webster's on the definition of cloning, abortion, organ transplanting, etc. to the extent that they define the ethics and moral decisions that go along with them? They want to redefine \"evolution\" to further their atheist agenda, why not other scientific words? \n \n \"Science\" often has a difficult time restricting itself to actual science (for political purposes), that's the reason it conflicts with religion so much. It's not religion's fault.",

   "Two points:\n \n 1) How evolution is defined by the public, or by religious groups does not really matter. The scientific definition of evolution is well described on that website you posted. When scientists discuss evolution they analyse it from the prespective explained on talkorigins. (My lecturers used similar language, though they didn't quote D. Futuyma)\n \n 2) From the same website\n \n \nRecently I read a statement from a creationist who claimed that scientists are being dishonest when they talk about evolution. This person believed that evolution was being misrepresented to the public. The real problem is that the public, and creationists, do not understand what evolution is all about. This person's definition of evolution was very different from the common scientific definition and as a consequence he was unable to understand what evolutionary biology really meant. This is the same person who claimed that one could not \"believe\" in evolution and still be religious! But once we realize that evolution is simply \"a process that results in heritable changes in a population spread over many generations\" it seems a little silly to pretend that this excludes religion! \n \n Scientists such as myself must share the blame for the lack of public understanding of science. We need to work harder to convey the correct information. Sometimes we don't succeed very well but that does not mean that we are dishonest. On the other hand, the general public, and creationists in particular, need to also work a little harder in order to understand science.

   "Hello marc9000, I hope the hiatus in our debate was not to long. To business:\n\n \n Not a problem, but I'm running out of time tonight. Please don't misinterpret my briefness for defeat. :p (briefness may not even be a word, but I don't really care - I'm sure pandion will let me know)\n \n \n \n \nThats not a misunderstanding, but a difference of opinion. \n\n \n I AGREE WITH THAT! :) \n \n \n \n \nI'd say there are differences between an atheist, agnostic, humanist and a freethinker, and also between a Darwinist and and a [modern] evolutionist. People like to have their outlooks described accurately- much in the same way a member of the Greek Orthodox Church will be unimpressed if you refer to them as a Catholic, and vice-versa. \n\n \n There can be differences, but nothing unites differences better than to have a common opponent. (such as creation)\n \n \n \n \nOnly in your black and white outlook.\n\n \n It really is black and white, if they both disagree almost equally (politically)with believers in God.\n \n \n \n \nBut no, I think it is the curisoity. After all, it is that same desire to understand that gave us religion- all thats changed is our background understanding of the world we exist in with the contempory scientific view. You might also say its reminded alot of Christians not to read poetic allegory as historical fact ;) \n\n \n Is the \"contemporary scientific view\" all we need to know about the world we exist in? There is no other source of knowledge? Are there things that we can clearly see all around us that we know science can never hope to explain? A word called \"love\" for example?\n \n \n \nSo you are now saying publicly funded scientific research is reactionary and conducted with the purpose of attacking religion? I find that to be an arguement with as much strength as wet tissue paper. \n\n \n When money is involved, it certainly can be.\n \n \nAlso, could you explain exactly how you would determine what sciences are \"reactionary groups who want to nay-say religion\"?\n\n \n I would determine it with a political look, how the money flows, where it comes from, and where it goes. (hey that rhymes)\n \n \n \nSeparation of religion from State? I thought you were all in favour of that! But my point stands- there are plenty of allegedly scientific creationist researchers out there- there are even plenty of actual scientists among them. So why can they not put together a research proposal to challenge the science of evolution from a YEC viewpoint, ID viewpoint etc? I suggest it is because any such work would not be scientific because, at some level, it suspends the need to examine further and instead fillls a gap in understanding with an assumption of faith. \n\n \n It's a slow process, but it may be happening, there has got to be a reason there is so much controversy (on these forums for instance) about it. College campuses seem nervous about it too. \n \n http://www.townhall.com/opinion/columns/davidhorowitz/2005/04/25/15221.html\n \n How welcome do you think Phillip Johnson or William Dembski would be at this university?\n \n \n \nThat article just demonstrates the authors ignorance of what life is in scientific terms as well as constructing a strawman arguement based around the 2nd law of thermodynamics. Life is reverse entropy- it is the temporary imposition of order onto otherwise chaotic matter.\n\n \n Later.\n \n \n \nAlso notable is the authors assumption that evolutionary trends should make sense to us. That is an utterly fallicious outlook- the trends of evolution are often strange and defy superficial assumptions people make. Returning to our topic matter of Tiklaaik is an excellent example of this. Digit bearing limbs did not evolve to allow animals to walk on land but were adaptations to a specialised aquatic existance. Subsequently, these structures have been adapted to terrestrial locomotion. \n\n \n The trends of Christianity can be the same way. emoticon_idea \n \n \n \n \nI disagree- and I think you would find Christianity takes a pretty dim view of both.\n \n \n \n Fortunately for all of us science as a whole has not put itself in such a straight jacket of scope. What exactly is \"the present\" anyway? \n\n \n Repeatable - testable - observable, the things science must restrict itself to if it wants to separate itself from religion.\n \n \n \n \nA naturalistic philosophy underpins all modern science, so I guess there is no more medical research funding when you are in control. The presupposition you infer is a conclusion drawn from previous studies and has stood up to repeated challenges from other scientific studies. \n\n \n But it should sometimes stand up to challanges from other sources of knowledge, besides science.\n \n \nBut like I said above, you can construct a study to test the scientific validity of aspects of evolution etc.\n\n \n It depends on what the word \"evolution\" means in this case.\n \n \n \nWell I appreciate that religion plays a big part in US politics but should atheism, a valid belief hel by some people have no representation at all? \n\n \n It should have as much political representation as anything else. The playing field is not level when it has almost all of science politically on it's side. \n \n \n \n \nWell it didn't work. I'd also suggest that if capital expenditure on research and endevour is your bug-bear you are looking up the wrong tree. I'd start with the sequoia-sized one just behind you with the NASA fruit on it ;)\n\n \n I agree with you 100%. I'm no fan of NASA. (N ever A S traitht A nswer)\n \n \n We might actually be debating the finer scientific details of the nature article.......... there is certainly more than one viewpoint to be considered there.\n \n \n \n \nIsn't the separation of Church and state supposed to create a non-theistic apparatus of state in which all people can follow their own beliefs (be it Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Sikh, Agnositc, Atheist or Disciple of the Noodly Appendage) without the imposition of other beliefs, however subtle via the State?\n\n \n I don't know what the separation of church & state is, because it's not in the U.S. Constitution.",

A point that is frequently pointed out to creationists to no avail. There is no implication of \"improvement\" in evolution.

The example given of long necked giraffes is a true one, yet the fact that there is still a reasonable (depending on allele number and distribution) statistical chance of a short necked infant being produced by two long necked parents, seems to suggest to me an element of chance within the mechanism of evolution. However that could be just me.\nWell, that would have more to do with the dominant/recessive nature of the genes involved. For example, take the peppered moth. The chance that two typica morphs (the light ones) will produce a carbonaria morph (the dark ones) is zero. The color is controled by a single gene and the carbonaria is dominant. There would have to be a mutation (again).",

If you don't, there are plenty of other scientists out there who will call you up on your shortfall. The rest of the world frequently looks no further than the information provided by the morning paper, or whichever periodicals they subscribe to. In this sense it has to be said that any person who can train themselves to think logically, and to consider all sources, even those that don't appeal to them for ideological, political and even religious reasons are above the common crowd of people who believe what they are told by someone else...\n \n Having read several of your posts on multiple threads I still don't understand how you think the theory of evolution relates to the government of the USA.

If you want to know what biological evolution is, you ask an expert in biological evolution, not a dictionary.\n \n \nTheir reasoning, is that they know how science works, so they should better know how to define the term.\n\n Because they are talking about what evolution actually is, not how people use the word \"evolution,\" their reasoning is correct.\n \n \nThe truth is, Webster's knows better how the term is used in society, how it's referred to by EVERYONE for communication purposes, not just scientists.\n\n Glad to see you recognize the discrepancy.\n \n \nWhat would prevent talkorigins from attempting to supersede Webster's on the definition of cloning, abortion, organ transplanting, etc. to the extent that they define the ethics and moral decisions that go along with them? They want to redefine \"evolution\" to further their atheist agenda, why not other scientific words?\n\n Slippery slope, anyone?",

   "\n Having read several of your posts on multiple threads I still don't understand how you think the theory of evolution relates to the government of the USA. I would appreciate it if you would specify what you mean.\n\n \n I have mentioned the words \"hope\" and \"fear\" briefly in past posts, this is my chance to explain it more clearly.\n \n It's human nature to have hopes and fears - we all have them. A significant part of religion deals in them, and a significant part of science deals in them. Hopes and fears are involved in the government of the USA (or any government) - you can't keep them out. If science would stick to observable, testable, secular things that we all can see and experience with our five senses, then hope and fear wouldn't be involved. But when science presupposes no creator in it's \"naturalisic\" quest to make all its discoveries, hope and fear are involved, probably to a more intense extent than they are in religion. One example is the topic of this thread - \"Another Gap Filled\". It is an emotional \"hope\" of naturalists, humanists, agnostics, atheists, evolutionists, etc. etc. to see \"evidence\" that there is no God. A \"fear\" is relieved, if something may indicate to them that there is no hell. \n \n Scientific studies of \"global warming\" are also a good example of scientific hope and fear. Science and government, can easily become God. Science can claim that it's studies of global warming are based on repeatable, observable, secular things. But when they're done behind the closed doors of laboratories, (with financing involved) they're not repeatable and observable by enough of the general public in a free society to justify political decisions being made without the public consent.\n \n So if religion can't be involved in government, then so much of science shouldn't be involved in government. If it is, then it's NO DIFFERENT than religon. When political government mandates are issued concerning global warming, science and all of it's naturalistic theories are closely related with government. When public funding is mandated for more \"Tiktaalik\" studies, science and all of it's evolutionary theories are closely related with government. Specific enough? \n \n \n The title of this thread is \"another gap filled\". Was it filled in science, in evolution, or in atheism?

   "Since I'm being specifically asked to answer those points, I'll give it a shot...\n \n \nIt's human nature to have hopes and fears - we all have them. A significant part of religion deals in them, and a significant part of science deals in them. Hopes and fears are involved in the government of the USA (or any government) - you can't keep them out. If science would stick to observable, testable, secular things that we all can see and experience with our five senses, then hope and fear wouldn't be involved.\n\n \n It is true that all people have hopes and fears (even those evil moral vacuums the atheists); however a scientific theory is emotionless. Over enthusiastic scientists attempting to introduce emotion into scientific theories develop a reputation as being a bit odd, and their work is often shot down by other scientists. Scientific theory predicts that the world will one day either be swallowed, or will be scorched into a crisp when the sun expands at towards the end of its 'life'. I presume this isn't what most people hope, and I certainly expect people to fear something like that, but that doesn't matter to the theory that it will happen.\n \n By the way, as germs are not directly observable by our 'five senses' do you not accept that theory either?\n \n \nBut when science presupposes no creator in it's \"naturalisic\" quest to make all its discoveries, hope and fear are involved, probably to a more intense extent than they are in religion. One example is the topic of this thread - \"Another Gap Filled\". It is an emotional \"hope\" of naturalists, humanists, agnostics, atheists, evolutionists, etc. etc. to see \"evidence\" that there is no God. A \"fear\" is relieved, if something may indicate to them that there is no hell.\n\n \n I really don't know where you get this idea from. You seem to be saying that all those who don't believe what you do are 'atheists' and destined for hell. (That does sound about right for some of the more fervent branches of several religions.) Due to this scientists feel the need to reassure themselves that hell does not exist. Have you considered the contradiction you are making here? In one breath you call them atheists, and in the next you say they are frightened of eternal damnation by an entity that (as you claim) they don't believe in... \n \n Also it doesn't seem to make any sense that you accuse science of dealing in hope and fear more than religion.... But that surely is obvious....\n \n As Collin and various others have already posted, science makes no comments about God. I'm not going to restate all their points here. I would agree with someone (I apologise but I couldn't find the line) on here who said that science attempts to explain the natural world, and God is supernatural (If He is there at all), and is therefore outside the boundaries of science.\n \n \nScientific studies of \"global warming\" are also a good example of scientific hope and fear. Science and government can easily become God. Science can claim that it's studies of global warming are based on repeatable, observable, secular things. But when they're done behind the closed doors of laboratories, (with financing involved) they're not repeatable and observable by enough of the general public in a free society to justify political decisions being made without the public consent.\n\n \n Global warming... Oh dear, we've wandered a bit from the ToE, but I'll indulge you. Global warming is a scientific theory that has been seized on by the media and Greenpeace like organisations. It's a classic example of the difference between a scientific theory and the public interpretation of a theory. The theory states that the Earth is warming up, perhaps due to some human influence, but also possibly due to Milancovic (Sp?) cycles or some global temperature cycle (as is readily observable in the fossil record) or some combination of these things. The public view is that oil tycoons and those who don't like wind farms are evil people hell-bent on destroying the planet in order to acquire as much wealth and power as possible. \n \n What relevance does that have to your post? Well it illustrates quite well that the public do not usually bother to inform themselves. I don't have any direct qualifications in global warming, yet I have read on it, and have supported the theory that appears to me to have the most evidence. The general public take whatever is spoon fed to them by those in authority or the media; they do not often exert themselves to find out more. The fact that the data on global warming, and details on the methods used to collect that data, are available in libraries and on the internet, means that people could find out more, and (in some cases) repeat the experiment or reanalyze it to see if their findings agree. This negates your comment about 'closed doors of laboratories'. Ask someone about the Peer review process sometime. The fact that people don't bother is not the fault of the scientific community.\n \n As regards funding and political decision making, I can't speak for the US, but I agree with electrolyte. Governments are meant to inform themselves and make decisions for you. That's why they govern, and that's what you vote for. As I have said, the information is out there, if you have the will to find it.\n \n \nSo if religion can't be involved in government, then so much of science shouldn't be involved in government. If it is, then it's NO DIFFERENT than religon. When political government mandates are issued concerning global warming, science and all of it's naturalistic theories are closely related with government. When public funding is mandated for more \"Tiktaalik\" studies, science and all of it's evolutionary theories are closely related with government. Specific enough? \n\n \n It's specific! And I thank you for clarifying your position. However you seem to have made the classic mistake (deliberate or otherwise) of 'science is a religion'. Science is not a religion. It offers no solace about life. It offers no guidelines on how to behave. It gives no ideas about life after death. Science is merely a collection of theories about how the world works. To some it up simply science is about the 'how' in life. Religion deals with the 'why'.\n \n It comes down to this: If you can accept that science is not a religion, then your arguments crumble by themselves. Science is used by governments as it provides the best data and is the best predictive tool available to us, and it is a simple tool, not a belief. If you refuse to accept that science is not a religion, then there is no way to argue with you. If the facts on here and in many other places don't convince you, then nothing I can say will. \n \n Anyway, that's my stab at that. I apologise if anyone fell asleep before the end...",

   "And you can say it 3,000 times, that doesn't automatically make it true. As Colin suggested, find some scientific papers that say \"Since XYZ, there is obviously no god\" As you keep saying, science is naturalistic. God is supposedly above natural laws (ie. \"supernatural\"), so science has nothing to say for or against the existence of god. God is outside the purview of science.\n \n \n We're the scientific community? Come on Marc...\n\n \n No, we're not the scientific community, we're the general public. Post #'s 2,3,4,6,12, etc. show how the general public can be taken in by scientific implications.\n \n \n \nIt's outside the scope of this thread, but as the quote says \"If atheism is a religion, then bald is a hair colour\" \n\n \n That statement can look good at a quick drive by glance, but a more in depth look exposes it for what it is. Religion is largely hope and fear. If varying hair colors show varying degrees of hope and fear, baldness is also a degree of hope and fear.\n \n \n \nWhy do I get the impression that anyone who doesn't agree with your narrow viewpoint of what a christian should believe is automatically an \"atheist\"? \n\n \n I couldn't begin to imagine how you get your impressions. The atheists that refer to Miller often readily admit that they are devout atheists.\n \n \n \nAs far as I know, atheists don't predict anything, so there goes that option. \n\n \n \"As far as you know\" isn't always very far - possibly not near far enough to justify throwing out options.

   "Since I'm being specifically asked to answer those points, I'll give it a shot...\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is true that all people have hopes and fears (even those evil moral vacuums the atheists); however a scientific theory is emotionless. Over enthusiastic scientists attempting to introduce emotion into scientific theories develop a reputation as being a bit odd, and their work is often shot down by other scientists. \n\n \n Saying that a scientific theory is emotionless is a lot like saying that it is perfect. I don't believe it's possible for a group of imperfect humans to come up with one perfect thing, just like I don't believe it's possible for emotional scientists to come up with an emotionless theory.\n \n I don't see over enthusiastic scientists like Richard Dawkins being labeled as odd, or targeted by other scientists.\n \n \nScientific theory predicts that the world will one day either be swallowed, or will be scorched into a crisp when the sun expands at towards the end of its 'life'. I presume this isn't what most people hope, and I certainly expect people to fear something like that, but that doesn't matter to the theory that it will happen. \n\n \n This theory is a great comfort to atheism, because it would be a picnic compared to what is predicted in the book of Revelation.\n \n \nBy the way, as germs are not directly observable by our 'five senses' do you not accept that theory either? \n\n \n Their effects are directly observable, in a far more secular, non controversial way than life on earth hundreds of millions of years ago.\n \n \n \n \nI really don't know where you get this idea from. You seem to be saying that all those who don't believe what you do are 'atheists' and destined for hell. (That does sound about right for some of the more fervent branches of several religions.) \n\n \n I take no pleasure in it, but it is what the Bible says.\n \n \n \nDue to this scientists feel the need to reassure themselves that hell does not exist. Have you considered the contradiction you are making here? In one breath you call them atheists, and in the next you say they are frightened of eternal damnation by an entity that (as you claim) they don't believe in... \n\n \n I don't think it's a contradiction at all. Atheism can't prove that hell doesn't exist, and the comfort it seeks in naturalism involves hope and fear that is comparable to religion. \n \n \nAlso it doesn't seem to make any sense that you accuse science of dealing in hope and fear more than religion.... But that surely is obvious....\n\n \n Maybe not more, but it is comparable. \n \n \nAs Collin and various others have already posted, science makes no comments about God. I'm not going to restate all their points here. I would agree with someone (I apologise but I couldn't find the line) on here who said that science attempts to explain the natural world, and God is supernatural (If He is there at all), and is therefore outside the boundaries of science. \n\n \n Science doesn't, but naturalism does. Science is a mere tool, naturalism is a belief system - one that elevates science to a higher position than it deserves.\n \n \n \n \nGlobal warming... Oh dear, we've wandered a bit from the ToE, but I'll indulge you. Global warming is a scientific theory that has been seized on by the media and Greenpeace like organisations. It's a classic example of the difference between a scientific theory and the public interpretation of a theory. The theory states that the Earth is warming up, perhaps due to some human influence, but also possibly due to Milancovic (Sp?) cycles or some global temperature cycle (as is readily observable in the fossil record) or some combination of these things. The public view is that oil tycoons and those who don't like wind farms are evil people hell-bent on destroying the planet in order to acquire as much wealth and power as possible. \n\n \n This is an example of the tool of science being given too much political power. Science can only go so far in determining what the cause of global warming is, there is a stopping point. Naturalists assume that man is causing it, then political decisions are made based on the naturalist point of view, with political gains for naturalism.\n \n \nWhat relevance does that have to your post? Well it illustrates quite well that the public do not usually bother to inform themselves. I don't have any direct qualifications in global warming, yet I have read on it, and have supported the theory that appears to me to have the most evidence. The general public take whatever is spoon fed to them by those in authority or the media; they do not often exert themselves to find out more. The fact that the data on global warming, and details on the methods used to collect that data, are available in libraries and on the internet, means that people could find out more, and (in some cases) repeat the experiment or reanalyze it to see if their findings agree. This negates your comment about 'closed doors of laboratories'. Ask someone about the Peer review process sometime. The fact that people don't bother is not the fault of the scientific community.\n\n \n But it doesn't give the scientific community the right to impose themselves on the general public. Political decisions should be made by and for the people, not by and for the scientific community.\n \n \nAs regards funding and political decision making, I can't speak for the US, but I agree with electrolyte. Governments are meant to inform themselves and make decisions for you. That's why they govern, and that's what you vote for. As I have said, the information is out there, if you have the will to find it. \n\n \n The main point of my posts here is the establishment clause of our first amendment. So many seem to think that all forms of religion can be removed from government, and neutrality will prevail. There's no such thing as neutrality in government. When religion is moved out, atheism will move in.\n \n \n \n \nIt's specific! And I thank you for clarifying your position. However you seem to have made the classic mistake (deliberate or otherwise) of 'science is a religion'. Science is not a religion. It offers no solace about life. It offers no guidelines on how to behave. It gives no ideas about life after death. Science is merely a collection of theories about how the world works. To some it up simply science is about the 'how' in life. Religion deals with the 'why'. \n\n \n Do you think ~naturalism~ is a religion? I think it is, and I think it is often hard to distinguish from \"science\".\n \n \nIt comes down to this: If you can accept that science is not a religion, then your arguments crumble by themselves. Science is used by governments as it provides the best data and is the best predictive tool available to us, and it is a simple tool, not a belief. If you refuse to accept that science is not a religion, then there is no way to argue with you. If the facts on here and in many other places don't convince you, then nothing I can say will. \n\n \n Science is not a religion, but ALL scientists, and ALL governments, have a religion. Science is a LIMITED tool.\n \n \nAnyway, that's my stab at that. I apologise if anyone fell asleep before the end...\n\n \n A good post - I appreciate it.",

A theory littered with emotion is more likely to be flawed, however that does not mean that an emotionless theory cannot be flawed. (I can see some sort of point being scored off that comment but there you go). As to the Dawkins thing, I personally don't like the man, from the little I have seen of him, and I would review his work in the same way I would any other scientists. Hero worship is not a part of good science, and Dawkins is not a hero.\n \n \nThis theory is a great comfort to atheism, because it would be a picnic compared to what is predicted in the book of Revelation.\n\n \n You missed the point of that. The point was that science says nothing about hopes and fears. Theories just are. Anyway, Revelations predicts the reign of the Antichrist, the proliferation of false prophets and it all ending with sinners being cast into the fiery pit. When the sun expands the latter is very likely to occur, and the former two are merely a matter of opinion. \n \n \nTheir effects are directly observable, in a far more secular, non controversial way than life on earth hundreds of millions of years ago.\n\n \n True. The effects of life on Earth millions of years ago are directly observable by our 'five senses'. They are called fossils. I'm sure you'll come at me with some flood idea, or that our dating techniques are incorrect, etcetera. But quite frankly that is rubbish. I know quite a bit about fossils, and have followed this debate for years. None of the points raised about the 'fraud' in the fossil record have convinced me.\n \n \nI take no pleasure in it, but it is what the Bible says.\n\n \n Beware what you say. Statements like that lead to very dark and dangerous places. Not too long ago Muslims did some terrible things in many countries, because 'The Koran says it'. The point I was making was that just because other people don't believe what you do, that in know way makes them atheists. Don't forget the pantheon of deities worshiped around the world. Rather than 'atheists' maybe you should say 'heretics'. It applies more closely to what you are saying and also encompasses those who believe slightly different things to you.\n \n \nI don't think it's a contradiction at all. Atheism can't prove that hell doesn't exist, and the comfort it seeks in naturalism involves hope and fear that is comparable to religion. \n\n \n Huh? Atheism doesn't involve the concept of hell, and therefore no proof for or against it is needed. You do seem to believe that all those who accept the theory of evolution believe in naturalism, which is a bit odd. When Collin names supporters of Theistic Evolution, you denounce them as liars who are atheists at heart....\n \n \nMaybe not more, but it is comparable.\n\n \n This could well be the crux of the matter. You seem to be talking about the public perception of science and scientific theories. We are talking about the actuality of scientific theories. As I and others have said, scientists are not responsible for the perversion of theory by the media, or authority figures, or organized religions. The true data is out there, if the public truly wished to know, rather than sitting around moaning about not being told.\n \n \nScience doesn't, but naturalism does. Science is a mere tool, naturalism is a belief system - one that elevates science to a higher position than it deserves.\n\n \n So you are arguing that science has become the weapon of those who believe in naturalism? It makes sense within the context of your argument, but your argument has been shown to be flawed by many. For my two cents; some scientists are naturalists, some atheists, some agnostics, some religious (Insert list of world religions here). The fact is that when conducting scientific investigations, religious persuasion is not involved (Unless your name is Kent Hovind). As I have said science is meant to be pure analysis of testable and repeatable facts. Again you've stuck yourself in a position it's almost impossible to argue with. You believe that scientists are all naturalists, and it's impossible to argue with a belief, however misguided. I will tell you that it's not true. Most scientists I know have an 'I don't know' attitude.\n \n \nThis is an example of the tool of science being given too much political power. Science can only go so far in determining what the cause of global warming is, there is a stopping point. Naturalists assume that man is causing it, then political decisions are made based on the naturalist point of view, with political gains for naturalism.\n\n \n Huh? Are you saying that Global warming is caused by God? Maybe it is... But until He sticks his finger in the oceans and warms them directly, we can't tell that He is involved. As I said, science suggests multiple causes for Global warming, however since we can't move the planet relative to the sun, and since we don't fully understand global temperature cycles, we attempt to crack down on the one thing we can change. Human pollution. Many people do say that man has caused Global Warming, and I argue with them. Yet according to you I'm an atheist and a believer in naturalism, and therefore I believe that all things on this planet are caused by man. But I don't. What gains are naturalists meant to be getting out of this anyway? Cutting carbon emissions doesn't directly benefit anyone, although it does hurt power companies. Maybe naturalists are secret Greenpeace agents, hell-bent on infiltrating the White House...\n \n \nBut it doesn't give the scientific community the right to impose themselves on the general public. Political decisions should be made by and for the people, not by and for the scientific community.\n\n \n The entire point of science is that science says: 'Here is the evidence, this is what we think it means'. There is room in there for disagreement. Religion on the other hand says: 'This is God's will. Do it'. There is no room for disagreement. Which do you think is more imposing? The trouble with leaving government to the people is that the people, by and large, are uninformed, misinformed, or ignorant (wilfully or otherwise). Read Plato's Republic sometime. That gives a very interesting view of a perfect society (and there's not a democracy in sight). If the people informed themselves of the true theory and its basis, then maybe more political decisions would be understood. Government by representative democracy (such as a republic or a parliamentary system) involves decisions made for the public, but not by them. The only decisions the public makes are for grand sweeping party generalizations at each election.\n \n \nThe main point of my posts here is the establishment clause of our first amendment. So many seem to think that all forms of religion can be removed from government, and neutrality will prevail. There's no such thing as neutrality in government. When religion is moved out, atheism will move in.\n\n \n I know little of the First amendment. I've read what has been posted on different threads on here (including a rather technical argument between Freddie von Flash and Pandion), but I make no claims to expertise. As far as I am aware, the first amendment deals with the segregation of the church and state. You seem to have a black and white view, which runs along the lines of 'Where my religion isn't there is only atheism'. Have you considered the fact that there may be nothing there? That possibly there are people out there for whom God is not a major issue? People who neither accept nor deny the existence of God, but concentrate more on their job? Also it does sound a bit like sour grapes. 'My religion isn't allowed in, so if I call science a religion, maybe that won't be let in either'\n \n \nDo you think ~naturalism~ is a religion? I think it is, and I think it is often hard to distinguish from \"science\".\n\n \n Naturalism is a belief. It is the belief that everything on this planet has occurred with no divine influence. Science will often seem similar because as was said before science can only test within the natural environment. However there is an important distinction. Naturalism states: 'There is no God, or if there is, He's got nothing to do with us'. Science states: 'We have no data to determine the existence of God one way or the other, therefore we will make no judgement about his existence.\n \n \nScience is not a religion, but ALL scientists, and ALL governments, have a religion. Science is a LIMITED tool.\n\n \n And that is what I thought you'd say. I hate to break it to you, but not everyone has a religion. Not everyone, searches for meaning in the presence or absence of a deity. As I have said before in this post, some people don't think about it. Some people's lives would not change if religions collectively crumbled tomorrow. Also good scientists don't interpret the data they get according to pre-conceived notions based on faith or prejudice. Science is limited, I agree. It's limited to the natural realm, and to the boundaries of logic. That's why science does not seek to prove, disprove or replace God.\n \n Glad you liked the last post... :)",

I think it's more likely to be a part of the nature of humans who don't worship God. Dawkins is a best selling author - his mindset, (word for word phrases in many cases) are all over internet forums that deal in the creation / evolution controversy. Hero worship seems to be very important in the attempts to downgrade creationism, from Dawkins to Miller. It shows from the link in the first post of this thread, and then throughout this thread.\n \n \n \n \nYou missed the point of that. The point was that science says nothing about hopes and fears. Theories just are. \n\n \n I didn't miss the point - 100% of all theories are arrived at by human scientists with hopes and fears. The only theories that \"just are\" are non controversial and agreed upon by just about everyone.\n \n \nAnyway, Revelations predicts the reign of the Antichrist, the proliferation of false prophets and it all ending with sinners being cast into the fiery pit. When the sun expands the latter is very likely to occur, and the former two are merely a matter of opinion. \n\n \n And I believe that the most effective false prophet today is one who claims to be Christian, and downgrades creationism.\n \n \n \n \nTrue. The effects of life on Earth millions of years ago are directly observable by our 'five senses'. They are called fossils. I'm sure you'll come at me with some flood idea, or that our dating techniques are incorrect, etcetera. But quite frankly that is rubbish. I know quite a bit about fossils, and have followed this debate for years. None of the points raised about the 'fraud' in the fossil record have convinced me.\n\n \n That's a place where we have to agree to disagree, and that's fine. I think the observability by five senses of the here and now on earth, (the effects of germs, for example) are studied in a much more diverse, widespread way than the often isolated study of fossils. This \"widespread\" term that I use indicates a study that involves much more of the public - the best police there is for fraud. Isolated fossil study seldom has that type of peer review.\n \n \n \nBeware what you say. Statements like that lead to very dark and dangerous places. Not too long ago Muslims did some terrible things in many countries, because 'The Koran says it'. The point I was making was that just because other people don't believe what you do, that in know way makes them atheists. Don't forget the pantheon of deities worshiped around the world. Rather than 'atheists' maybe you should say 'heretics'. It applies more closely to what you are saying and also encompasses those who believe slightly different things to you.\n\n \n The subject however, is creationism vs. naturalism. Two distinct positions - one has to be true and the other has to be false. A self described Christian can pretend to be (or truly believe to be) a naturalist, but the more they combine their philosophy with atheist naturalists, the more distanced they will become from ALL teachings of the Bible. My religious view isn't nearly as narrow as many (not necessarily you) on these forums try to make them out to be.\n \n \n \nHuh? Atheism doesn't involve the concept of hell, and therefore no proof for or against it is needed. \n\n \n But all atheists are humans, and the concepts of truthfulness, generosity, love, etc. are human traits. I believe most atheists have a certain degree of uncertaintity about hell, however small, and they seek comfort in science.\n \n \n You do seem to believe that all those who accept the theory of evolution believe in naturalism, which is a bit odd. When Collin names supporters of Theistic Evolution, you denounce them as liars who are atheists at heart....\n\n \n That's because I have a general concept of what the Bible teaches. Again, my view is not narrow, because the 66 books of the King James Bible is widely accepted. If there was no creation very close to what was described in Genesis, then the rest of the Bible has little foundation. \n \n \n \nThis could well be the crux of the matter. You seem to be talking about the public perception of science and scientific theories. We are talking about the actuality of scientific theories. As I and others have said, scientists are not responsible for the perversion of theory by the media, or authority figures, or organized religions. The true data is out there, if the public truly wished to know, rather than sitting around moaning about not being told. \n\n \n That would be true if scientists were perfect, truth seeking robots with no financial interest in the matter. But human scientist philosophies, with all the associated hopes and fears, are almost always in there, to a comparable degree with religion. Both have their non controversial truths, and both have their controversial philosophies. \n \n \n \nSo you are arguing that science has become the weapon of those who believe in naturalism? \n\n \n Exactly! \n \n \n It makes sense within the context of your argument, but your argument has been shown to be flawed by many. \n\n \n Not very thoroughly. Did you see post #6?\n \n \nYeah, this is pretty much a win for science all around. \n\n \n If science is a \"simple tool and not a belief\", how can it achieve a \"win\"? The naturalists who used the tool their way achieved a win. Would science equally achieve a win, if there was widespread publicity about the scientific findings indicating the possible resting place of Noah's arc in Turkey? Is that a different kind of science?\n \n \n \nFor my two cents; some scientists are naturalists, some atheists, some agnostics, some religious (Insert list of world religions here). The fact is that when conducting scientific investigations, religious persuasion is not involved (Unless your name is Kent Hovind). \n\n \n Or unless the scientific investigations concern origins. If they do, then there are only two possibilities, they WERE created, or they WERE NOT created.\n \n \n \nAs I have said science is meant to be pure analysis of testable and repeatable facts. Again you've stuck yourself in a position it's almost impossible to argue with. You believe that scientists are all naturalists, and it's impossible to argue with a belief, however misguided. I will tell you that it's not true. Most scientists I know have an 'I don't know' attitude. \n\n \n If that were true, most U.S. universities wouldn't be so hostile to creationist presentations and speakers, and there wouldn't be such an intense political move in the U.S. to keep I.D. out of schools. Science is largely defined by people who are afraid of complete openness in analysis. Claims that I.D. is all supernatural and not scientific are simply not true. \n \n \nSo contemporary arguments for intelligent design in both biology and the physical sciences are not only testable; they make predictions and are falsifiable in principle. Of course, if the arguments are true, then they are falsifiable only in principle, but not in fact (hardly a weakness in a scientific theory). We have given only two examples here. There are many other design arguments in biology, origin-of-life studies, and paleontology that are also empirically testable and that make predictions. Therefore, honest commentators should stop claiming that ID is empirically untestable, or that it makes no predictions. The claim itself has been tested and falsified. It's time to move on to other and more pertinent aspects of the debate over intelligent design. \n \n \n http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/01...rica.html#more \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nHuh?

What gains are naturalists meant to be getting out of this anyway? \n\n \n Increase in the size and scope of government - a huge political issue in the U.S. \n \n \nCutting carbon emissions doesn't directly benefit anyone, although it does hurt power companies. Maybe naturalists are secret Greenpeace agents, hell-bent on infiltrating the White House...\n\n \n If you ever move to the U.S. there may be a place in the Democratic party for you! :) \n \n \n \n \nThe entire point of science is that science says: 'Here is the evidence, this is what we think it means'. There is room in there for disagreement. Religion on the other hand says: 'This is God's will. Do it'. There is no room for disagreement. Which do you think is more imposing? \n\n \n You've got it 180 degrees backwards. Science says 'here is the theory, here is the natural truth. This political decision must be made, no matter what the uninformed people think. (keeping I.D. out of schools is an example) Religion (in the U.S.) says, 'here is the Bible. Catholics, Protestants, Jews, etc. interpret it differently - there is room for disagreement. No certain, specific denomination should be established in the U.S. because the first amendment says so.' \n \n \nThe trouble with leaving government to the people is that the people, by and large, are uninformed, misinformed, or ignorant (wilfully or otherwise). Read Plato's Republic sometime. That gives a very interesting view of a perfect society (and there's not a democracy in sight). If the people informed themselves of the true theory and its basis, then maybe more political decisions would be understood. Government by representative democracy (such as a republic or a parliamentary system) involves decisions made for the public, but not by them. The only decisions the public makes are for grand sweeping party generalizations at each election. \n\n \n You make my point very well. (the U.S. Constitution leaves more decisions to the poeple than you indicate)\n \n \n \n \nI know little of the First amendment. I've read what has been posted on different threads on here (including a rather technical argument between Freddie von Flash and Pandion), but I make no claims to expertise. As far as I am aware, the first amendment deals with the segregation of the church and state. \n\n \n May I suggest you read what it actually says?\n \n \n Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercies therof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. \n\n \n The words segregation, church, state, not in there.\n \n \n \nYou seem to have a black and white view, which runs along the lines of 'Where my religion isn't there is only atheism'. Have you considered the fact that there may be nothing there? That possibly there are people out there for whom God is not a major issue? People who neither accept nor deny the existence of God, but concentrate more on their job? Also it does sound a bit like sour grapes. 'My religion isn't allowed in, so if I call science a religion, maybe that won't be let in either' \n\n \n I know there are a lot of people out there who neither accept nor deny the existance of God, and concentrate on other things. And every once in a great while, those people are confronted with a decision on this subject that can affect their family, their community, or their country. That decision will benefit politically, or harm politically, one side or the other. I know there are a lot of different beliefs, but when it comes to creationism or naturalism, in politics, there are only two positions. Most conflicts involve TWO positions. \n \n \n \n \nNaturalism is a belief. It is the belief that everything on this planet has occurred with no divine influence. Science will often seem similar because as was said before science can only test within the natural environment. However there is an important distinction. Naturalism states: 'There is no God, or if there is, He's got nothing to do with us'. Science states: 'We have no data to determine the existence of God one way or the other, therefore we will make no judgement about his existence. \n\n \n Can \"a simple tool and not a belief\" state that \"there is no data\", and that there can be no such data?\n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnd that is what I thought you'd say. I hate to break it to you, but not everyone has a religion. Not everyone, searches for meaning in the presence or absence of a deity. As I have said before in this post, some people don't think about it. \n\n \n And as I said before, sometimes they HAVE to think about it. They are easily swayed, and naturalists know it.\n \n \n \nSome people's lives would not change if religions collectively crumbled tomorrow. Also good scientists don't interpret the data they get according to pre-conceived notions based on faith or prejudice. \n\n \n Or on the source of their paychecks. Or on the premise that other forms of knowledge may interpret data in ways that they can't. I wish I had the faith in human nature to believe that an overwhelming number of scientists are \"good\". But my knowledge of the Bible, and history, and activity at today's universities, prevents it.\n \n \nScience is limited, I agree. It's limited to the natural realm, and to the boundaries of logic. That's why science does not seek to prove, disprove or replace God.\n \n Glad you liked the last post... :)\n\n \n Thanks for your time. I hope we can move along - agreeing to disagree on certain points as quickly as possible, and wrap this up before long with no hard feelings. And if one person stumbles accross this who doesn't give any thought to these things.....well just maybe they'll have something to fall back on if (WHEN) they're confronted with it later.",

   "Just a quick note:\n \n \n \n The very fact that you say 'it is often hard to distinguish from science' means that you yourself acknowledge the distinction between them. And as they are distinct, then scientists cannot be blamed for the actions of those following this evil naturalist agenda.....\n\n \n There should be a distinction between them, and it seems to be closing. It is possible for the meanings of words to \"evolve\". The topic of this thread being called a \"win\" for science would indicate that. \n \n Let's look at an example of a word that evolved in a fairly short time. The word \"GAY\". (from dictionary.com)\n \n \n1.Of, relating to, or having a sexual orientation to persons of the same sex. \n 2.Showing or characterized by cheerfulness and lighthearted excitement; merry. \n 3.Bright or lively, especially in color: a gay, sunny room. \n 4.Given to social pleasures. \n 5.Dissolute; licentious. \n\n \n When I was growing up in the 60's, definitions 2 and 3 applied, while definitions 1, 4, and 5 DID NOT. It's changed that quickly. Can the definition of science change that quickly also, so as not to be distinguishable from naturalism? I think it's happening right now. \n \n \n \nUsage Note: The word gay is now standard in its use to refer to homosexuals, in large part because it is the term that most gay people prefer in referring to themselves. Gay is distinguished from homosexual primarily by the emphasis it places on the cultural and social aspects of homosexuality as opposed to sexual practice. \n\n \n Is \"science\" the term that most naturalists prefer in referring to themselves??? Y E S. It seems like militant activists are able to change definitions of words, doesn't it??",

   "I don't see over enthusiastic scientists like Richard Dawkins being labeled as odd, or targeted by other scientists.\nBut then, you don't actually read scientific literature or make any effort to educate yourself, do you? You haven't heard simply because you haven't had the integrity to look. Let me give you a clue - Dawkins isn't the guru that you make him out to be. I know that you don't like what he has to say therefore you assign some sort mystical status to him among evolutionary scientists. I can guarantee the he has no such status.\n \n Anyone who has actually paid attention to evolutionary science in the last couple of decades is quite aware of the running theoretical battles between two camps. While there is no disagreement among biologists as to whether evolution has taken place, there is considerable debate about the processes and mechanisms of evolution. While most scientists limit their views to their published papers, some have written books and thus have brought the debate into public view. How sad that you don't know about it. I only shows your dismal ignorance of the subject and the worth of your objections.\n \n For example, it took little effort to find the following on my bookshelf.\n \n Sterelny, Kim. 2001. Dawkins vs. Gould: Survival of the Fittest. Totem Books. Lanham, MD.\n \n Morris, Richard. 2001. The Evolutionists: The Struggle for Darwin's Soul. W.H. Freeman and Company. New York.\n \n Both books deal with the major debate about the process of evolution among leading evolutionary scientists. One side exemplified by Gould, the other by Dawkins. Gould even discusses the issues in the book that he considered his legacy.\n \n Gould, Stephen Jay. 2002. The Structure of Evolutionary Theory. The Belknap Press of Harvard University. Cambridge, MA.\n \n As explained by Collin, Dawkins doesn't determine evolutionary theory. And along with GazzaElliot, I'm not all that fond of Dawkins. Some of his ideas are interesting, but I'm a hands on field biologist. Genetics is much more interesting and meaningful to me that meme theory.",

   "I don't really think hero worship is good in any subject\n\n \n Even in a religion? I thought hero worship was a big part of it.... (If God isn't a hero to his people, what is He?)\n \n \nI think it's more likely to be a part of the nature of humans who don't worship God\n\n \n Huh? Where do you get that one from? As I say, many people don't have a hole in their life that needs filling with a 'God' figure.\n \n Dawkins is quoted because his language is more directly applicable to the debate in many cases due to his stance on this issue. Scientists shouldn't seek to downgrade creationism. It's not relevant to science, anymore than the belief that the Earth was created by the Song of the Anuir.... However scientists will defend their corner when attacked by the more rabid of the religious out there.\n \n \nI didn't miss the point - 100% of all theories are arrived at by human scientists with hopes and fears. The only theories that \"just are\" are non controversial and agreed upon by just about everyone.\n\n \n See electrolyte's post 212\n \n \nAnd I believe that the most effective false prophet today is one who claims to be Christian, and downgrades creationism.\n\n \n You just agreed with me that the non-fire related parts of the Revelation are subjective and therefore a belief, or unsubstantiated point-of-view, and therefore irrelevant to a scientific discussion\n \n \nThat's a place where we have to agree to disagree, and that's fine. I think the observability by five senses of the here and now on earth, (the effects of germs, for example) are studied in a much more diverse, widespread way than the often isolated study of fossils. This \"widespread\" term that I use indicates a study that involves much more of the public - the best police there is for fraud. Isolated fossil study seldom has that type of peer review.\n\n \n I agree with electrolyte that this is merely shoving the issue out of the way due to it being inconvenient. You evidently know little about palaeontology (I use the UK spelling BTW). Palaeontology is one of the more popular sciences, with there being tens of thousands of amateur palaeontologists in this country alone, in a similar way to amateur astronomy. These people are more than capable of reviewing papers, and in fact the level of knowledge of many amateurs continues to surprise me. It's true that some know little or nothing, but it takes all sorts. These journals that these 'isolated fossil stud[ies]' are reported in are hardly rare or obscure. In fact many of them are available online, and all have a correspondence address for comment or explanation. Anyway, saying that the public are the best police for fraud is a load of rubbish. Adolf Hitler said: 'The great masses of the public will more easily fall victim to a big lie than a small one', and he was correct. The public believe what they want to, not what is true. If that's not the case, why are there so many religions, and why do they they evolve over time?\n \n \nThe subject however, is creationism vs. naturalism. Two distinct positions - one has to be true and the other has to be false. A self described Christian can pretend to be (or truly believe to be) a naturalist, but the more they combine their philosophy with atheist naturalists, the more distanced they will become from ALL teachings of the Bible. My religious view isn't nearly as narrow as many (not necessarily you) on these forums try to make them out to be.\n\n \n See electrolyte's post 212. It is interesting that your religious source is just the Bible, there are no quotes from the Koran or any other creation-story bearing text. Also aren't the merits of Christians supposed to be judged by God and God alone? 'Judge not lest ye be judged' (Mt 7:1?). You do seem to have turned a debate about the political influence of the ToE into a rant against these 'atheist naturalists' (See previous posts)\n \n This may interest you: http://www.thelantern.com/media/storage/paper333/news/2004/10/13/Opinion/Judge.Not.Lest.Ye.Be.Judged-751612.shtml?norewrite200605040524&sourcedomain=www.thelantern.com\n \n \nBut all atheists are humans, and the concepts of truthfulness, generosity, love, etc. are human traits. I believe most atheists have a certain degree of uncertaintity about hell, however small, and they seek comfort in science.\n\n \n I don't know what point you are trying to make with the first sentence and as I said I can't argue with a belief, however misguided. I personally don't fear hell, and seek no reassurance about it.\n \n \nThat's because I have a general concept of what the Bible teaches. Again, my view is not narrow, because the 66 books of the King James Bible is widely accepted. If there was no creation very close to what was described in Genesis, then the rest of the Bible has little foundation. \n\n \n Your wide view returns to accusing those who are not biblical literalists of heresy.... Anyway, the King James Bible was as much made for political reasons as religious ones, and you yourself are worried about the effect of political propaganda for spreading a world view. Many religious people including the Archbishop of Canterbury (Head of the Catholic Church in the UK) do not advocate Creationism, and believe it should not be taught in schools\n \n \nBoth have their non controversial truths, and both have their controversial philosophies. \n\n \n Nothing in science is incontrovertible. Evidence could be just around the corner that the theory of gravity is wrong, and gravity is well established as a theory.\n \n \nOriginally Posted by Kronus\n Yeah, this is pretty much a win for science all around. \n \n If science is a \"simple tool and not a belief\", how can it achieve a \"win\"? The naturalists who used the tool their way achieved a win. Would science equally achieve a win, if there was widespread publicity about the scientific findings indicating the possible resting place of Noah's arc in Turkey? Is that a different kind of science?\n\n \n Kronus shouldn't have used the word 'win'. I think most of us know what he means, but the use of that word was unscientific. (Apologies if that seems harsh Kronus). What he means was 'validation'. Tiktaalik supplied more evidence for the ToE, but didn't provide a victory for science in the sense of a soccer game. I think this has already been covered extensively in this thread. I have heard rumour of the resting place of Noah's ark in Turkey. I'd be interested to hear more and to see the data on which it is based. I would suggest it hasn't been published due to either incomplete processing on unreliability. If you have data on it, start a new thread and I'll happily examine it. I would also suggest saying it is the ark is not a good way to start. Preconceived notions are not well received.\n \n \nOr unless the scientific investigations concern origins. If they do, then there are only two possibilities, they WERE created, or they WERE NOT created.\n\n \n The ToE doesn't deal with origins..... Also there is not necessarily a dichotomy here. It depends on your definition of creation.\n \n \nIf that were true, most U.S. universities wouldn't be so hostile to creationist presentations and speakers, and there wouldn't be such an intense political move in the U.S. to keep I.D. out of schools. Science is largely defined by people who are afraid of complete openness in analysis. Claims that I.D. is all supernatural and not scientific are simply not true.\n\n \n See electrolyte's post 212. There wouldn't be a move to keep it out, if it wasn't so intent on forcing its way in. If it was science, then the natural progression of science would have seen it taught. The very fact that there is a need to force it into schools suggests its non-scientific nature. Accusing science of being narrow minded is to my mind just laughable, particularly coming from a literalist. ID does, by its own definition suggest the supernatural does it not? It also has a very closed-minded attitude, and is not disprovable (how can you disprove the supernatural in scientific theory?) and is therefore a supposition or an assertion not a theory. That website was an ID website and therefore is hardly going to produce an unbiased version of events....\n \n \nIncrease in the size and scope of government - a huge political issue in the U.S. \n\n \n So the naturalists are using the ToE to get governmental powers expanded, and to take power away from the people? Hmmmmmm.... emoticon_confused \n \n \nIf you ever move to the U.S. there may be a place in the Democratic party for you! \n\n \n Although it's got nothing to do with this or you, my political views are slightly right of centre, what we refer to in this country as a Conservative, roughly the equivalent of a mild Republican. However given that the best the Republican Party has to offer is George W and Dick Cheney, paint me blue and call me a donkey....\n \n \nYou've got it 180 degrees backwards. Science says 'here is the theory, here is the natural truth. \n\n \n See electrolyte's post 212\n \n \nThis political decision must be made, no matter what the uninformed people think. (keeping I.D. out of schools is an example) Religion (in the U.S.) says, 'here is the Bible. Catholics, Protestants, Jews, etc. interpret it differently - there is room for disagreement. No certain, specific denomination should be established in the U.S. because the first amendment says so.'\n\n \n But you were just arguing that the government was by and for the people... Does this mean that you now agree with me and pandion? I'm not sure that I see what point you are trying to make...\n \n \nYou make my point very well. (the U.S. Constitution leaves more decisions to the poeple than you indicate)\n\n \n Again, I made my point, a logical follow up to my previous posts. Are you saying that you agree with me?\n \n \nThe words segregation, church, state, not in there.\n\n \n See electrolyte's post 212, and pandion's posts in other threads....\n \n \nwhen it comes to creationism or naturalism, in politics, there are only two positions\n\n \n Fundamentalism anyone?\n \n \nCan \"a simple tool and not a belief\" state that \"there is no data\", and that there can be no such data?\n\n \n See electrolyte's post 212, and yes it can if there is no way of obtaining the data within the realm of that tool.\n \n \nAnd as I said before, sometimes they HAVE to think about it. They are easily swayed, and naturalists know it.\n\n \n From a religious person.....\n \n \nOr on the source of their paychecks. Or on the premise that other forms of knowledge may interpret data in ways that they can't. I wish I had the faith in human nature to believe that an overwhelming number of scientists are \"good\". But my knowledge of the Bible, and history, and activity at today's universities, prevents it.\n\n \n If there are valid, scientific forms of analysis they should be presented. Some scientists do present the data that is required of them, Global Warming is a good example, yet papers like that spark a flurry of controversy and counter-papers. If you believe the world is irredeemably evil, then I feel sorry for you. It is the correct stance for a Christian though.\n \n On the subject of the word 'gay': The word was actually first used in the homosexual context on the Manchester Ship Canal in order to change the view (predominantly Christian) of homosexuals as sodomites and sinners. The hope was that, by referring to themselves as gay, they would change public perception of themselves. The difference between this and science/naturalist is that there is no public pressure to hide naturalism, or to reform it. Modern society is wonderfully liberal in its attitude to religion (at least over here).\n \n I feel that we are almost at an impasse. I'll answer points that you put on here, but I feel that there isn't too much further that it can go....",

   "But then, you don't actually read scientific literature or make any effort to educate yourself, do you? You haven't heard simply because you haven't had the integrity to look. Let me give you a clue - Dawkins isn't the guru that you make him out to be. I know that you don't like what he has to say therefore you assign some sort mystical status to him among evolutionary scientists. I can guarantee the he has no such status. \n\n \n He's not targeted on these forums. He's referred to in more than 116 pages at talkorigins. He was quoted in the opening link of this thread. He has status, all right.\n \n \n \nAnyone who has actually paid attention to evolutionary science in the last couple of decades is quite aware of the running theoretical battles between two camps. While there is no disagreement among biologists as to whether evolution has taken place, there is considerable debate about the processes and mechanisms of evolution. While most scientists limit their views to their published papers, some have written books and thus have brought the debate into public view. How sad that you don't know about it. I only shows your dismal ignorance of the subject and the worth of your objections. \n\n \n It's only your assumption that I don't know about it. Your assumption is about as worthless as your guarantee above. \n \n \nFor example, it took little effort to find the following on my bookshelf.\n \n Sterelny, Kim. 2001. Dawkins vs. Gould: Survival of the Fittest. Totem Books. Lanham, MD.\n \n Morris, Richard. 2001. The Evolutionists: The Struggle for Darwin's Soul. W.H. Freeman and Company. New York.\n \n Both books deal with the major debate about the process of evolution among leading evolutionary scientists. One side exemplified by Gould, the other by Dawkins. Gould even discusses the issues in the book that he considered his legacy. \n\n \n Dawkins vs. Gould, and atheist vs. an agnostic. What complete information. \n \n \n \nAs explained by Collin, Dawkins doesn't determine evolutionary theory. And along with GazzaElliot, I'm not all that fond of Dawkins. Some of his ideas are interesting, but I'm a hands on field biologist. Genetics is much more interesting and meaningful to me that meme theory.\n\n \n As I said, his quote was featured in the opening link of this thread. What major philosophy of his do you disagree with?",

   "Even in a religion? I thought hero worship was a big part of it.... (If God isn't a hero to his people, what is He?) \n\n \n I was talking about imperfect, human ones.\n \n \n \n \nHuh? Where do you get that one from? As I say, many people don't have a hole in their life that needs filling with a 'God' figure.\n\n \n They may claim not to, but many peoples' actions don't convince me that it's true.\n \n \nDawkins is quoted because his language is more directly applicable to the debate in many cases due to his stance on this issue. Scientists shouldn't seek to downgrade creationism. It's not relevant to science, anymore than the belief that the Earth was created by the Song of the Anuir.... However scientists will defend their corner when attacked by the more rabid of the religious out there. \n\n \n I guess the worldview one has is what determines their perception of who is doing the attacking and who is doing the defending. \n \n \n \nIt is interesting that your religious source is just the Bible, there are no quotes from the Koran or any other creation-story bearing text. Also aren't the merits of Christians supposed to be judged by God and God alone? 'Judge not lest ye be judged' (Mt 7:1?). You do seem to have turned a debate about the political influence of the ToE into a rant against these 'atheist naturalists' \n\n \n I'm not judging. I'm just looking at how different worldviews effect politics. \n \n \n \n \nI don't know what point you are trying to make with the first sentence and as I said I can't argue with a belief, however misguided. I personally don't fear hell, and seek no reassurance about it. \n\n \n My point has to do with that thing about science not being the only source of knowledge.\n \n \n \nNothing in science is incontrovertible. Evidence could be just around the corner that the theory of gravity is wrong, and gravity is well established as a theory.\n\n \n Just about ANYTHING in science can be incontrovertible if politics (funding) is involved.\n \n \n \nKronus shouldn't have used the word 'win'. I think most of us know what he means, but the use of that word was unscientific. (Apologies if that seems harsh Kronus). What he means was 'validation'. Tiktaalik supplied more evidence for the ToE, but didn't provide a victory for science in the sense of a soccer game. I think this has already been covered extensively in this thread. I have heard rumour of the resting place of Noah's ark in Turkey. I'd be interested to hear more and to see the data on which it is based. I would suggest it hasn't been published due to either incomplete processing on unreliability. \n\n \n I got a quick, passing glance at it on a DVD. It hasn't been widely published because it's not politically correct. \n \n \n \nIf you have data on it, start a new thread and I'll happily examine it. I would also suggest saying it is the ark is not a good way to start. Preconceived notions are not well received.\n\n \n It seemed to be well done, all the proper chemical elements, the Biblical measurements etc. I'll see if I can find out more about it.\n \n \n There wouldn't be a move to keep it out, if it wasn't so intent on forcing its way in. \n\n \n There is a huge difference between \"forcing it's way in\", and seeking a small fraction of equal time.\n \n \nIf it was science, then the natural progression of science would have seen it taught. The very fact that there is a need to force it into schools suggests its non-scientific nature. \n\n \n Or that it's blocked by political special interests. We have the ACLU here, and it has a huge warchest. It seeks certain immorality, that goes along with naturalism.\n \n \nAccusing science of being narrow minded is to my mind just laughable, particularly coming from a literalist. ID does, by its own definition suggest the supernatural does it not? It also has a very closed-minded attitude, and is not disprovable (how can you disprove the supernatural in scientific theory?) \n\n \n By indoctrinating undecided people with links that were in the opening post of this thread.\n \n \nand is therefore a supposition or an assertion not a theory. That website was an ID website and therefore is hardly going to produce an unbiased version of events....\n\n \n Just the same as naturalist websites. There are no unbiased websites on this subject.\n \n \n \nSo the naturalists are using the ToE to get governmental powers expanded, and to take power away from the people? Hmmmmmm.... emoticon_confused \n\n \n If there is no God, then man was not endowed by his creator with unalienable rights. Prominent men (educated ones) grant rights, and take them away.\n \n \n \n \nAlthough it's got nothing to do with this or you, my political views are slightly right of centre, what we refer to in this country as a Conservative, roughly the equivalent of a mild Republican. \n\n \n Eeeeverybody wants to be a conservative. \n \n \n However given that the best the Republican Party has to offer is George W and Dick Cheney, paint me blue and call me a donkey....\n\n \n This also helps, from one of your previous posts;\n \n \nThe trouble with leaving government to the people is that the people, by and large, are uninformed, misinformed, or ignorant (wilfully or otherwise). Read Plato's Republic sometime. That gives a very interesting view of a perfect society (and there's not a democracy in sight). If the people informed themselves of the true theory and its basis, then maybe more political decisions would be understood. Government by representative democracy (such as a republic or a parliamentary system) involves decisions made for the public, but not by them. The only decisions the public makes are for grand sweeping party generalizations at each election. \n\n \n Consider yourself painted.:) \n \n \n \nSee electrolyte's post 212\n \n I agree with electrolyte \n \n See electrolyte's post 212. \n \n \n See electrolyte's post 212\n \n \n See electrolyte's post 212, and pandion's posts in other threads....\n \n \n \n Fundamentalism anyone?\n \n \n See electrolyte's post 212, \n \n \n From a religious person.....\n \n \n If you believe the world is irredeemably evil, then I feel sorry for you. It is the correct stance for a Christian though.\n \n I feel that we are almost at an impasse. I'll answer points that you put on here, but I feel that there isn't too much further that it can go....\n\n \n You're right about that, thank you. emoticon_wow",

   "Some theories are philosophical, and some are not. It's often hard to distinguish between them, and that's how some scientists like it.\n\n Yet another non-response. (We're not going to have to start counting these, are we?) It fails to address your dilemma of the \"just are\" theories.\n \n \nBy those who are interested in such things, and few have the recources to prove it wrong.\n\n Then how did Piltdown man get exposed as a hoax? You see, we can come up with specific exampes that you ignore in your attempt to cram reality into your paradigm, but those of us who are even remotely familiar with the issue know better than to accept your statements at face value. In your fervor to come up with any response at all, your entire paragraph is largely non-responsive to my point.\n \n \nWhat is a third option for how human life originated, that's not an extension of one of those two things?\n\n How loosely do you get to arbitrarily define \"creationism\"? Even ignoring the eleventy bajillion creation myths, one could pull the \"evolution with assistance\" bit that some ID proponents use. It's certainly not creationism in AiG's or ICR's sense, but it's not \"naturalistic\" either.\n \n \nIt tries so hard to \"prove\" naturalistic origins, to disprove creation. If God didn't create us, he would be far less likely to hold us accountable for our actions.\n\n It doesn't try to \"prove\" naturalistic origins. It is used to try to describe the universe. If there is some issue regarding a deity and that deity's treatment of humans, then that's a problem for your paradigm, not a scientist's understanding of the universe.\n \n \nBy proving to be better than creationist pseudoscience. Creationists say, \"There are no transitional fossils.\" Evolutionary theory predicts, \"We'll find transitional fossils.\" A (yet another) transitional fossil was found.\n Real science: +1. Pseudoscience: -1.\n\n It constantly flips back and fourth in this thread. In some posts, science is innocent - it does not attempt and cannot prove naturalism over creation. Now, it's back to being \"better\" than creationism. It's the process of the word \"science\" harmonizing with naturalism, like the other word I referenced.\n\n You're simply misinterpreting my reply due to poor wording on my part. By \"proving to be better,\" I mean proving to be \"better\" in a productive sense (e.g. more accurate, more explanatory, and more representative of reality), not \"better\" in a snobbery sense. Credit isn't given for turning one's nose up to somebody, but for being correct. Creationist pseudoscience simply isn't, and is in fact disgustingly wrong, hence the loss of credit.\n Perhaps we are not seeing eye to eye because we have not made the distinction between \"creation\" and \"creationism.\" Science has very much falsified most versions of \"creationism,\" but science cannot prove naturalism, just as it cannot \"prove\" anything.\n \n \nSo those educated in science are more qualified to analyze how science and religion are applied politically than anyone else?\n\n And religion? No. Religion shouldn't be applied politically at all.\n \n \nAs interpreted by the ACLU? Sorry, I prefer to go by it's acutal text.\n\n As interpreted by anybody with reasonable comprehension of the English language. You can ask for help if you feel the need.\n Since the actual text of the Constitution also doesn't include phrases like \"separation of powers\" and \"checks and balances,\" I suppose you think those are made-up fantasies too?\n \n \nSo unprovable naturalism can control the definition of a tool, and unprovable creationism has no say in the matter?\n\n The definition of science is what science actually is, not what people choose to call it. If I call you a purple elephant, does that mean you're really a purple elephant? Like I said, when the Dover board tried to change the definition of science, they failed... miserably.\n \n \n \nCould you have done this \"roasting\" by yourself, or did you need your friends help? Were you more interested in roasting, than listening? A two night seminar - how many nights do naturalists get? Is anyone permitted to \"roast\" them?\n\n Oh, I could have given him an awfully hard time all by myself, but some of my friends are better at argumentation rather than just presenting the facts that people try to sweep under the rug. He had actually promised to not present the same old tired arguments that he's been presenting for years, so I went in eager to hear what he had to say; of course, it was the same old XXXX we've roasted before, so he got it again. He was so bad, the small group of his supporters that showed up left early.\n How many nights naturalists get is irrelevant to my rebuttal of your assertion. But just for the record, I don't recall a single special seminar dedicated to the topic of evolution.\n \n \n \nThose aren't in question in U.S. politics, they have far too little support. But you knew that, didn't you?\n\n Damn right I knew, just as you know that there is \"far too little support\" of creationism in the scientific community to justify teaching it in science classes (even without that little First Amendment problem). So you can stop your special pleading now and save being repeatedly called a hypocrite. Or not, it's really your choice.\n \n \n \nChange it? So \"science\" is already \"naturalism\"? It's later than I thought.\n\n Did I give you too much credit regarding reasonable comprehension of the English language?\n \n \n By the way, I'm still waiting for the apology/retraction thing regarding my allegedly using a second screenname.",

What was I saying about hypocrisy?\n \n \nWords are defined by people.\n\n If I choose to define the word Fundamentalist as \"a purple elephant,\" does that mean that all Fundamentalists are purple elephants?\n Science is a methodology that works in a certain way.

(Incidentally, one of them kept in touch with us afterward via email about a special session of Bible study just for him, but he changed his mind after we set a date.) Really, though, does it matter? Whether they left because we were roasting the speaker or whether the speaker was being roasted is neither here nor there; neither the speaker nor his supporters were able to rebut our points.\n Creationists are at a disadvantage simply because they provide falsehoods and fallacies as evidence, not because of any alleged personality differences. After all, when I calmly pointed out that this fellow ignored an important concept that he claimed to understand the previous evening, he got upset and griped at me. When I asked that he justify ignoring the concept in the second instance, he refused and moved on. Notice that I didn't bring up a new topic out of the blue to throw him off; earlier he had brought up the topic himself, and the second time he was simply ignoring it because it was detrimental to his argument.

This thread would have ended up the same way if I hadn't posted here.\n \n \nPrecisely when the other side throws civility and courtesy to the wind is when we need bend over backwards to address any legitimate concerns that our opponents might be raising. (emphasis mine) This keeps us on topic and maintains our composure. This is important because maintaining composure under pressure is especially effective for establishing one's credibility.\" - Bill Dembski\n\n \n It depends on the mindset of whom we're attempting to establish credibility with.

Strangely enough, whether science is the only source of knowledge is not really the issue here.

   "A for or against standpoint may be unscientific, but it's reality in POLITICS. Is it the hallmark of a fundamentalist to be concerned about political changes in their society?\n\n \n It may be that politics in the US is a good deal simpler than over here, hover the entire point of politics is that there are more than two points of view. That's why there is a political spectrum. People don't agree, and even people on the same party don't agree. Politics is in fact the art of compromise. The absence of political process leads to tyranny and despotism, where all bar one view is ignored. And it is the mark of a fundamentalist to oppose changes in society for dogmatic reasons....\n \n \nHow ironic is it really, concerning the reality of the persuasive means by naturalism of converting the masses in the U.S. today, as well as Europe?\n\n \n You missed the point of the irony, and you're complaining that people find scientific theory more persuasive than religion? Again, that's down to the people...\n \n \nGeorge Bush didn't have a thing to do with this thread. To bring him up in a negative way out of the clear blue can easily be an endorsement of his liberal opposition. I know that's my for or against standpoint, but again, it is reality in politics.\n\n \n No he doesn't, but you brought up political allegiance as a way of diminishing my argument (See Post 210)\n \n \nIf you ever move to the U.S. there may be a place in the Democratic Party for you! \n \n \n I therefore defended myself, at which point you got both patronising and insulting. If you start a boulder rolling, take responsibility for where it stops. The world of politics is not black and white....\n \n \nRegarding the general public as uninformed agrees with Bush's liberal opposition. The founders of the U.S. didn't regard the general public as being uninformed. \n\n \n Erm.... Well the impression I got from some of Pandion's threads was that they did. If they didn't regard the public as uninformed, why did were voting rights for Negroes restricted? Why was the constitution not debated amongst more than the founding fathers (who were the gentry as I understand it). Anyway I'll hand you over to the more experienced Pandion for this one. I personally believe that the general public today are uninformed. Try talking to people outside your usual group about something complex. Many won't understand it.....\n \n \nIt's only my reaction, when my points are cast out because I'm labeled a \"fundamentalist\". \n\n \n I didn't call you a fundamentalist, I merely said that your definition of with me or against me was reminiscent of a fundamentalist attitude. You seem to find a lot of insults on here....\n \n \nI appreciate seeing the thoughts of Europeans on the subject, not because I'm somehow downplaying your government, but because you're an outsider looking in, possibly without the bias that a U.S. citizen could have. But you are influenced by international news, and the U.S. is naturally looked at with a critical eye, because of it's stature in the world.\n\n \n One minute you say I'm unbiased, and the next you say I'm biased by world news.... You are however correct about the world media. America is closely examined, however that review is critical (the act of observing closely and commenting on things observed) without necessarily being inherently critical (the act of placing observations in an inherently bad light due to prejudice).\n \n \nAlternatives to their worldviews?\n\n \n Yes. Children will consider what they are told by their biology teacher and by their RS teacher and their parents and their preacher, and decide what they want to believe. That's the process of growing up. It takes considerable effort to maintain an open mind throughout life.\n \n \nI'm not trying to invalidate anything scientific. I'm questioning inflated claims of \"scientists\" who claim to know more than science teaches them.\n\n \n True scientists teach only what they know the data suggests, the ToE is an example of this. If others claim things have scientific basis when there is nothing scientific to back it up, they are not scientists, and scientists are not responsible for their actions...\n \n \nQuote:\n As far as I can tell you are arguing that there is a plot by 'atheist naturalists' \n \n \n U.S. politics is loaded with it, yes.\n\n \n Erm... I'm not sure what you want someone on here to answer. This forum is about ToE/ID/C. Anyway both electrolyte and I have demonstrated the fact that there are those who believe in a deity and evolution.\n \n \nYes I'm happy that you concede that naturalism is a religion. My point is that electrolyte, the ACLU, the American Atheists, talkorigins, and the U.S. Supreme Court, and many others whose political influence directly affects my life, don't agree with you.\n \n \n Well I dispute that naturalism is a religion. It is a belief. Electrolyte has merely stayed more on topic than me, and has been waiting for you to prove that scientist and naturalist are one and the same. You haven't managed that yet.\n \n \nDo you know that the Gospel of Judas is not part of the Bible, and has no relevance? Do you know why?\n\n \n This is a follow up to your claimed 'wide view of religion'. Arguing that you have such a view and then dismissing out of hand a new gospel is a non sequitor. I personally think what I have read in this new gospel is interesting. I imagine you also believe the Apocrypha is also not relevant, despite actually being removed from the Bible by the Catholic Church at its conception. There are many other gospels that have come to light as well. As some-one with a wide view, at least knowledge of their existence would be expected. Why does it have no relevance? Well from your point of view it is a non-dogmatic unauthorized text and is therefore heretical. I've already said why I think it's relevant.\n \n \nAgain, two positions in politics. Disagree with one, and it's impossible to not agree with the other.\n\n \n I've answered this, but I'd ask you to talk (about things other than religion) to some of these people you brand. Find out how accurate you are.\n \n \nAt the moment, yes. You'd hate to see it? Check it out on pages 3 thru 6 of this thread.\n\n \n You've cherry picked on pages 14, 15, and 16.

Are those your words, or do you have a source for them? Do you have a source for any of that?\n \n \nModern interpretation of canonization\n Many modern Protestants point to four \"Criteria for Canonicity\" to justify the books that have been included in the Old and New Testament, which are judged to have satisfied the following:\n \n Apostolic Origin - attributed to and based on the preaching/teaching of the first-generation apostles (or their close companions). \n Universal Acceptance - acknowledged by all major Christian communities in the ancient world (by the end of the fourth century). \n Liturgical Use - read publicly when early Christian communities gathered for the Lord's Supper (their weekly worship services). \n Consistent Message - containing a theological outlook similar or complementary to other accepted Christian writings. \n The basic factor for recognizing a book's canonicity for the New Testament was divine inspiration, and the chief test for this was apostolicity. The term apostolic as used for the test of canonicity does not necessarily mean apostolic authorship or derivation, but rather apostolic authority. Apostolic authority is never detached from the authority of the Lord. See Apostolic succession.\n \n It is sometimes difficult to apply these criteria to all books in the accepted canon, however, and some point to books that Protestants hold as apocryphal which would fulfill these requirements. In practice, Protestants hold to the Jewish canon for the Old Testament and the Catholic canon for the New Testament. \n\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_canon\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBecause you don't like it?\n\n \n No, because it wasn't included in all those processes.",

   "So the only choices are intelligent design or atheism? Say it with me, marc: theistic evolutionists.\n\n \n They really are the only choices, when it comes to politics. Political views quickly branch off from each one of them. \"Theistic evolutionists\" is largely a sub catagory of atheism, when it comes to worldviews. If a theistic evolutionist doesn't believe in creation, then he couldn't believe that man was created with unalienable rights. He couldn't believe that the world has a higher purpose (higher than man can understand) He couldn't believe that man has an eternal soul. The more a theistic evolutionist studied the Bible, the more he would realize that it's largely based on creation. If God didn't create, if Jesus and God weren't one, what authority would Jesus' teachings have? They would be practically the same with a theistic evolutionist, as they would with an atheist. They would both probably have the same eager desire to separate church and state. \n \n \n \nIn other words, you refuse to address my points. You can go ahead and continue pretending that theistic evolutionists don't exist, but with the availability of information, it's just willful ignorance on your part. \n\n \n Where is some detailed information on just what they do, and don't believe about the Bible?\n \n \n \nI'm not talking about Christians necessarily, only theists. You have absolutely no rebuttal for this; your only attempt at a response relies upon your ridiculous \"True Christian\u0099\" plea.\n\n \n Websters defines a Christian as one who believes in Jesus Christ and the Bible. In Matthew 12:30, Jesus says \"he that is not with me is against me\". Maybe those against him would agree on the separation of church & state. \n \n Websters defines a Theist as one who believes in \"a god\". Not necessarily one who has revealed himself to us - one who has a purpose for the world - one who claims that we have an eternal soul. I don't see how a theists worldview would differ from that of an atheist.\n \n \nThe Court cited Jefferson's phrasing in Reynolds v U.S. in 1878.\n\n \n All it did was cite it. It didn't become Constitutional doctrine untill 1947.\n \n \n \nWhat's funny is when the religious nuts rail against the ACLU when the ACLU stands up for their rights, too. \n\n \n The ACLU attempts to appease every once in a great while.

I don't see how Thanksgiving would be a national holiday, with pay for government employees, if that would have been in there.\n \n \n \nYou ought to agree that forcing a religion upon a person is infringement. Yet that's exactly what you're trying to do. If you don't agree, then you're just a hypocrite.

Christians who accept Gravity are not \"deceived\" anymore than Christians who accept Evolution.\n \n \nWhile we are recommending books, you ought to read Darwin's Blackbox by Mike Behe - in it, he agrees with Miller regarding the origins of life.

Common descent (which is what Miller accepts) does not necessarily contradict Intelligent Design, but evolution, as the term is used by the scientific community, certainly does. \n\n \n Alright, several things wrong here. First is that Miller does not agree with Behe on the origins of life. Miller is a theistic evolutionist who believes God plays His part by manipulating the natural laws of the universe. Behe believes God designed at least parts of life; Miller believes God didn't design anything, and just let the events flow from the start, intervening during important Biblical events.\n \n \nEither they are deists, as in they believe in a lifeless \"first cause,\" or they, like Miller, believe in Intelligent Design. As much as Miller would hate to admit it, he and Mike Behe (one of the most prominent ID advocates) agree on most issues of origins - they both accept common descent, and they both think that God was involved in the process that created mankind.\n\n \n That's a fairly vague idea. \"God was involved.\" No kidding? They're both believers-you would think that's a given, and I'm sure Miller's already aware of the similarity of such a religious perspective. However, if you're trying to imply that both Miller and Behe believe God was directly involved (as opposed to indirectly) in the process that created mankind, you would be incorrect. It helps to actually read Miller's book, in which he discusses these things...\n \n To add to the above, I'll say that Miller quite simply does not believe in Intelligent Design. \"God was involved\" does not mean Intelligent Design. For example, if I were to drive several boxes of hot pizza over to the office building of a prominent newspaper and give all the employees free food, I just got myself involved in the process. That is not to say I actually designed any aspect of the paper.\n \n \n They disagree about irreducible complexity, however. The fact of the matter is, Darwinism as it is defined by the scientific community is a form of naturalism - no God involved, just nature.\n\n \n No, that's not what the scientific community defines as \"Darwinism,\" or more aptly, \"the Theory of Evolution.\" Nowhere in the definition of Evolution does it say there was no God involved. Science as a whole just cannot prove if there was a God involved or not.

   "I think we get to the nub of marc's argument here:\n \n \nSee above. In addition to Jesus saying \"he that is not with me is against me\", earlier in Chapter 6, he said \"No man can serve two masters...\".\n\n \n You seem to say that because the Bible says that everything is black and white you don't believe in colour. Fair enough. I can tell you that you are wrong. I can show you a political spectrum that proves you wrong. You could ask any student of politics (either national or international), and they will tell you that you are wrong, but if you won't listen then there is no point.\n \n \nMany don't need to understand something complex. If it doesn't affect them, they usually don't need it forced upon them. \n\n \n That reinforces my point. Scientists inform themselves about many things not directly linked to their fields. The general public do not, preferring instead to moan about not being told. You have made my point about them being uninformed for me.\n \n \nTeachers should teach secular facts, and those facts should have nothing whatsoever to do with a child's worldview. Their role is completely different from that of a parent, or a \"preacher\" designated by a parent. \n\n \n Teachers are some of the most powerful forces in a child's formative years. Teachers have to teach more than just facts for the children to be able to wrap those facts into a context. Also many people (unlike you it seems) like to base their worldview on fact, rather than the tales of a \"preacher\"... (Also, are you saying that \"preachers\" don't use facts? Surely that's a bit of a problem to all those who believe them verbatim)\n \n \nIf data only \"suggests\" something, how scientific is it? If it suggests atheism, why is that okay, and yet when the newly discovered complexity of the simplest forms of life suggest intelligent design, it is not okay?\n\n \n You don't really have a clue about scientific process do you? All scientific data suggests. That is the point of a theory. It is a disprovable idea based on the data provided. It is the best suggestion that we can produce based on the data. The more data you get, the more likely that theory becomes, but it is never proved. It can never be confirmed. Again you're going down the 'all who don't think what I do are atheists line'. We've proved you wrong, again and again, but if you won't listen it's your loss. If the earliest forms of life did suggest a designer than fine, however, given that the earliest forms of life are largely hypothetical, and deduction from their complexity is pointless.\n \n And for my two cents:\n \n Evolution: Descent by genetic modification from a parent species to a new species.\n \n Christianity: A world religion set up around the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth. Largely spread around the old world by the Roman Empire and the Catholic Church. Exported around the world during the Age of Exploration.

   "Rather than stating my own opinion, I am demonstrating that the opinion of the scientific community as a whole is that evolution is an unguided, impersonal process, leaving no room in the process for God.\n\n \n Are you a member of the scientific community? Or are you trying to get your own opinion in under the radar? As has been said dozens of times, science makes no claims about God. We leave comments about God to the priests. Science cannot address the issue of God, and therefore doesn't try to. The more that Creationists and ID'ers push this theory that science is a naturalist plot and that all scientists are atheists hell bent on preventing entry of the divine, the more stupid they will look. Most scientists don't know, and are content. Several are Christian, and make their own peace between their religion and their work. Several come from other religions. I have wondered quite why only the fury of the secular Christian community has been stirred. Where are the other religions?\n \n \nIf evolution is non-theistic, then these believers are simply deceived. What is your point?\n\n \n Oh, so this is a Hovindite 'snare of the devil' then. Evolution is non-theistic. It is possible to believe that God created the world indirectly. He set the laws and then let the whole thing go. He knew what would happen, but it pleased Him to watch (I don't know why). In this version, both the ToE and the creation of the planet and all life sit comfortably together, however not in the literal sense of Genesis. Maybe these 'believers' have moved beyond the narrow literalist view of the Bible.\n \n \nThere's no distinction made in regard to the age of the earth. Why are \"old earth creationists\" not considered creationists? Why does the scientific community seek to divide those who believe in creation? \n\n \n The scientific community doesn't. This divide occurred within the creationist camp all by itself (A sort of ideological speciation event perhaps). Those who believed that science was accurate in the dating of the earth called themselves Old Earth Creationists in order to combat the literalist and frequently ridiculous claim of the Young Earth Creationists. So you can't blame us for that one.\n \n \nSo a theistic evolutionist would believe in natural selection as a method used by God? I wonder if they believe that natural selection caused man to be naturally selected to be in the image of God, or if man is just another form of animal? That's only one of many questions I would have for a theistic evolutionist.\n\n \n You're getting there! Very slowly, but the first steps are always the hardest. Questions are good. I believe they would answer that as God is a perfect being evolution may have a tendency to move towards that. That's not what the ToE says (before I get shot by electrolyte and Pandion amongst others), as the ToE dictates pre-existing adaptations to random events will cause speciation (natural selection), however, if God is setting the broad sweeping laws then He can do what He wants. This however does not support ID. The idea that God set the rules does not imply or mean that He messes around with the components.\n \n \nIt has been implied by many throughout this thread, using the phrase \"theistic evolution\". \n \n It is also highly dishonest for the scientific community to play games with the meaning of the word \"creationism\". \n\n \n Oh dear. Theistic evolution denies the literal account of Genesis. No more...\n \n \nIf they don't believe in creation, I could have a (short) debate with them about their interpretation of the Bible.\n\n \n It would be short.

For example, if I were to drive several boxes of hot pizza over to the office building of a prominent newspaper and give all the employees free food, I just got myself involved in the process. That is not to say I actually designed any aspect of the paper. \n\n \n And you wouldn't have any control of what was in the newspaper. If that was the scenario of how God \"let events flow\", he wouldn't have much control over worldly events, and he certainly wouldn't have the right to judge mankind, as the Bible claims he will. Does Miller address that in his book? I know you'll tell me to read it, but it would be much simpler if you'd just tell me. Why should I go to the trouble to get the book, seeking answers that probably aren't in there?\n \n \n \nNo, that's not what the scientific community defines as \"Darwinism,\" or more aptly, \"the Theory of Evolution.\" Nowhere in the definition of Evolution does it say there was no God involved. Science as a whole just cannot prove if there was a God involved or not. It's nice to see the same silly equivocation from someone else, after we heard Marc going on about it for the past two weeks...\n\n \n There is no comparison to what the scientific community defines, and what it implies. The link in post #1 of this thread makes that clear. That link shows what you call a \"silly equivocation\" to actually be a fact.",

   "I think we get to the nub of marc's argument here:\n \n \n \n You seem to say that because the Bible says that everything is black and white you don't believe in colour. Fair enough. I can tell you that you are wrong. I can show you a political spectrum that proves you wrong. You could ask any student of politics (either national or international), and they will tell you that you are wrong, but if you won't listen then there is no point. \n\n \n There can be plenty of colour in politics and religion, but they almost always have black and white starting points. The details of all the colors usually branch off from the basics of black & white.\n \n \n \n \nThat reinforces my point. Scientists inform themselves about many things not directly linked to their fields. The general public do not, \n\n \n Why would scientists inform themselves in a greater variety of things than the general public? The general public informs themselves about things directly linked to their lives, and the public's life, with all it's various occupations, family obligations, hobbies, etc. would be much more diverse than scientists occupations alone.\n \n \npreferring instead to moan about not being told. \n\n \n I see little evidence of the public \"moaning about not being told\" anything.\n \n \nYou have made my point about them being uninformed for me. \n\n \n A large group of \"uneducated\" people, know more collectively than one \"educated\" person. \n \n \n \n \nTeachers are some of the most powerful forces in a child's formative years. Teachers have to teach more than just facts for the children to be able to wrap those facts into a context. \n\n \n That's right. It's possible to teach them HOW to think, not WHAT to think, without indoctrinating them. \n \n \n \nAlso many people (unlike you it seems) like to base their worldview on fact, rather than the tales of a \"preacher\"... (Also, are you saying that \"preachers\" don't use facts? Surely that's a bit of a problem to all those who believe them verbatim) \n\n \n The \"tales of a preacher\" are no less valid than the philosophical assumptions of atheists. Worldviews aren't based on scientific \"facts\".\n \n \n \nYou don't really have a clue about scientific process do you? All scientific data suggests. That is the point of a theory. It is a disprovable idea based on the data provided. It is the best suggestion that we can produce based on the data. The more data you get, the more likely that theory becomes, but it is never proved. It can never be confirmed. Again you're going down the 'all who don't think what I do are atheists line'. We've proved you wrong, again and again, but if you won't listen it's your loss. If the earliest forms of life did suggest a designer than fine, however, given that the earliest forms of life are largely hypothetical, and deduction from their complexity is pointless.\n\n \n And scientific data is arrived at by imperfect humans. They often ~imply~ as in the first link of this thread. I've referred to it again and again, but if you won't listen it's your loss.\n \n \n \nAnd for my two cents:\n \n Evolution: Descent by genetic modification from a parent species to a new species. \n\n \n With the implication that \"parent species\" started out very simply, with no creation.\n \n \nChristianity: A world religion set up around the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth. Largely spread around the old world by the Roman Empire and the Catholic Church. Exported around the world during the Age of Exploration. Now to be found on every major continent, and (nearly) every country on the planet.\n\n \n Including the creation account in Genesis.",

   "Are you a member of the scientific community? Or are you trying to get your own opinion in under the radar? As has been said dozens of times, science makes no claims about God. We leave comments about God to the priests. Science cannot address the issue of God, and therefore doesn't try to. The more that Creationists and ID'ers push this theory that science is a naturalist plot and that all scientists are atheists hell bent on preventing entry of the divine, the more stupid they will look. \n\n \n Please check the link in this thread's opening post.\n \n \n \nMost scientists don't know, and are content. Several are Christian, and make their own peace between their religion and their work. Several come from other religions. I have wondered quite why only the fury of the secular Christian community has been stirred. Where are the other religions? \n\n \n Other religions aren't being attacked like Christianity is.\n \n \n \nOh, so this is a Hovindite 'snare of the devil' then. Evolution is non-theistic. It is possible to believe that God created the world indirectly. He set the laws and then let the whole thing go. He knew what would happen, but it pleased Him to watch (I don't know why). In this version, both the ToE and the creation of the planet and all life sit comfortably together, however not in the literal sense of Genesis. Maybe these 'believers' have moved beyond the narrow literalist view of the Bible. \n\n \n They don't sit comfortably together in a broad sense of much of the rest of the Bible either.\n \n \n \n \nThe scientific community doesn't. This divide occurred within the creationist camp all by itself (A sort of ideological speciation event perhaps). Those who believed that science was accurate in the dating of the earth called themselves Old Earth Creationists in order to combat the literalist and frequently ridiculous claim of the Young Earth Creationists. So you can't blame us for that one. \n\n \n So the age of the earth is the most important thing to old earth creationists? Far more important than most everything else the Bible teaches? They're content to ally with atheism to distance themselves from crazed YEC's? They don't care about ALL the other ways creation relates to human life? I'm very dubious of your ability to speak for old earth creationists.\n \n \n \n \nYou're getting there! Very slowly, but the first steps are always the hardest. Questions are good. I believe they would answer that as God is a perfect being evolution may have a tendency to move towards that. That's not what the ToE says (before I get shot by electrolyte and Pandion amongst others), as the ToE dictates pre-existing adaptations to random events will cause speciation (natural selection), however, if God is setting the broad sweeping laws then He can do what He wants. This however does not support ID. The idea that God set the rules does not imply or mean that He messes around with the components. \n\n \n Does he mess around with a purpose for the world? Does he mess around with holding us accountable for our actions? Does he mess around with any kind of guidance of the world?\n \n \n \n \nOh dear. Theistic evolution denies the literal account of Genesis. No more...\n\n \n Does it deny that God planned the world - as referred to in Psalms - Job - Isaiah - Acts - Ephesians?\n \n \n \n \nIt would be short. Your lack of comprehension of counter-arguments ensures that.\n\n \n If you can't answer my questions in this post, it will be shorter than I thought.",

   "Having had a break and refreshed myself at the wells of patience I will now respond to marc's challenge.\n \n \nThere can be plenty of colour in politics and religion, but they almost always have black and white starting points. The details of all the colors usually branch off from the basics of black & white.\n\n \n It's an interesting theory, and in some cases it's true. Things such as the death penalty tend to polarise society into for and against. However most issues have a broad spectrum of opinion due to there not being a \"for or against\" stance possible, or because some people say: 'it depends on the circumstances'. Ask different people a (non-loaded) political question and see how many start their response with 'it depends'\n \n \nWhy would scientists inform themselves in a greater variety of things than the general public? The general public informs themselves about things directly linked to their lives, and the public's life, with all it's various occupations, family obligations, hobbies, etc. would be much more diverse than scientists occupations alone.\n\n \n The general public is not a cohesive mass. They aren't all plugged into a computer or some form of organisation where they share all their knowledge. In most (not all) scientists will have a broader range of knowledge than the average individual (which is what you deal with when you talk of the general public). Scientists also are humans and have hobbies, occupations and families.\n \n \nI see little evidence of the public \"moaning about not being told\" anything.\n\n \n Well maybe it's not the problem for the US that it is here in the UK. People here moan about everything. I imagine the moaning is out there, if you listen for it.\n \n \nA large group of \"uneducated\" people, know more collectively than one \"educated\" person. \n\n \n See above. Also that's not always true..... It depends on who you are comparing with whom\n \n \nThat's right. It's possible to teach them HOW to think, not WHAT to think, without indoctrinating them. \n\n \n That's the point I'm making. Teachers teach differing perspectives on the same thing, and the background to them and let the children decide. As often as not children will follow the inclinations of the figures they like and respect (we are peer led animals after all). My teachers taught me both evolution and divine creation (albeit that the divine creation idea was in Religious Studies not Science. \n \n \nThe \"tales of a preacher\" are no less valid than the philosophical assumptions of atheists. Worldviews aren't based on scientific \"facts\".\n\n \n I never said they were any less valid, but there's no point me saying that scientist does not equal atheist. And it depends on whom you ask. Some people base their worldview on what they can see and feel, some on what they want to believe and some on scientific theory...\n \n \nAnd scientific data is arrived at by imperfect humans. They often ~imply~ as in the first link of this thread. I've referred to it again and again, but if you won't listen it's your loss.\n\n \n I never said scientists were perfect. They are not. However they are more informed on their subject area than non-specialists. I have already said that Kronus should not have used the word win. Data itself does not imply. Does the number 453 imply anything? That is a datum (singular of data) (quite for what I don't know). The theories based on that datum and others with it are implication based upon testable fact. However they are tested, and can be falsified/disproved. Creationism cannot be proved (and does not need to be being a belief) and is therefore not a scientific principle and is therefore not threatened by evolution.\n \n \nWith the implication that \"parent species\" started out very simply, with no creation.\n\n \n Huh? Did anyone else see that implication? Anyone? As has been said many, many times before, evolution says nothing about origins.....\n \n \nOther religions aren't being attacked like Christianity is.\n\n \n You perceive an attack. Maybe other religions are a bit less touchy...\n \n \nSo the age of the earth is the most important thing to old earth creationists? Far more important than most everything else the Bible teaches? They're content to ally with atheism to distance themselves from crazed YEC's? They don't care about ALL the other ways creation relates to human life? I'm very dubious of your ability to speak for old earth creationists. \n\n \n Just as I am dubious of your ability to speak for the broader Christian church. OEC's believe in the Christian God and in the general teachings of the Bible. They just don't think that the Bible should be taken absolutely literally\n \n \nDoes he mess around with a purpose for the world? Does he mess around with holding us accountable for our actions? Does he mess around with any kind of guidance of the world? \n\n \n Maybe He does, maybe He doesn't. That's a question for a priest or a believer of the theory I outlined... There is no reason why he couldn't have a purpose for the world (however fathoming the mind of the divine is not something I can do).\n \n \nDoes it deny that God planned the world - as referred to in Psalms - Job - Isaiah - Acts - Ephesians? \n\n \n Well, evidently, if He set the rules, then He can plan exactly what they lead to. There is a certain inevitability about evolution (read Simon Conway Morris) and geological processes, so yes the Earth could be planned out in detail, but have come about by natural processes without direct divine intervention\n \n \nIf you can't answer my questions in this post, it will be shorter than I thought. \n\n \n Does that satisfy you?",

   "Darwinism deals with the issue of origins - an issue with huge philosophical implications, which are not present in Newtonian physics. What you believe about where you came from will have a bigger impact on your life than why you believe an apple will always fall downwards.\n\n \n \n \n Waliking-fish:\n Evolution is consistent with many religious beliefs, as well as with atheism. But that's not relevant to your real objective. You can't handle the fact that religious doctrine must adapt itself to the evidence provided by science, can you? Evolution tears biblical literalism to shreds. Too bad. Your religion must adapt to the facts or else go extinct. Kepler & Copernicus showed that the Earth is not the center of the universe. Newton showed that angels don't have to be employed to make things fall down. Darwin showed that God didn't have to create each separate \"kind\" in mature form in one act of creation. This is the 21st century. Why do you have such a sentimental attraction for the middle ages?",

   "Having had a break and refreshed myself at the wells of patience I will now respond to marc's challenge. \n\n \n \"Refreshed at the wells of patience\" - I like that! I've been refreshing myself at the wells of \"having other things to do\". :) \n \n \n \n \nIt's an interesting theory, and in some cases it's true. Things such as the death penalty tend to polarise society into for and against. However most issues have a broad spectrum of opinion due to there not being a \"for or against\" stance possible, or because some people say: 'it depends on the circumstances'. Ask different people a (non-loaded) political question and see how many start their response with 'it depends' \n\n \n But when it comes time for a decision on who or what to vote for, there are often only two choices. \"It depends\", often means it depends on one's worldview.\n \n \n \n \nThe general public is not a cohesive mass. They aren't all plugged into a computer or some form of organisation where they share all their knowledge. In most (not all) scientists will have a broader range of knowledge than the average individual (which is what you deal with when you talk of the general public). Scientists also are humans and have hobbies, occupations and families.\n\n \n When it comes to how they live their lives, their hobbies, occupations, and families, I don't believe scientists have the slightest bit more knowledge than anyone else. The U.S. founders didn't think so either, or the Constitution would be written differently - the \"educated\" would have more political power.\n \n \n \n \nThat's the point I'm making. Teachers teach differing perspectives on the same thing, and the background to them and let the children decide. As often as not children will follow the inclinations of the figures they like and respect (we are peer led animals after all). My teachers taught me both evolution and divine creation (albeit that the divine creation idea was in Religious Studies not Science. \n\n \n And the point I'm making is that atheism is freely embraced in science, and any kind of I.D. is not - it's often prohibited.\n \n \n \nI never said scientists were perfect. They are not. However they are more informed on their subject area than non-specialists. \n\n \n But their political opinions are usually no more valid than non specialists. If older people, who have lots of experience in living have no more voting power than 21 year olds, scientists should have no more political power than non scientists.\n \n \nI have already said that Kronus should not have used the word win. Data itself does not imply. Does the number 453 imply anything? That is a datum (singular of data) (quite for what I don't know). The theories based on that datum and others with it are implication based upon testable fact. However they are tested, and can be falsified/disproved. Creationism cannot be proved (and does not need to be being a belief) and is therefore not a scientific principle and is therefore not threatened by evolution. \n\n \n The title of this thread is \"another gap filled\" - another attempt to get closer to a \"proof\" of atheism. Most of us here seem to agree that it can't be done, but the implication is there.\n \n \n \n \nHuh? Did anyone else see that implication? Anyone? As has been said many, many times before, evolution says nothing about origins.....\n\n \n YES. Many, many people see that implication, mainly children. Politicians of the future.\n \n \n \n \nYou perceive an attack. Maybe other religions are a bit less touchy...\n\n \n I perceive it because it's written in black & white in many legal cases all across the U.S. in the last 80 years or so.\n \n \n \n \nJust as I am dubious of your ability to speak for the broader Christian church. OEC's believe in the Christian God and in the general teachings of the Bible. They just don't think that the Bible should be taken absolutely literally\n\n \n If something can't be destroyed all at once, the first step is to weaken it. The Claim that God didn't create, gives him less authority to judge, to love, to oversee, to guide, etc.\n \n \n \n \nMaybe He does, maybe He doesn't. That's a question for a priest or a believer of the theory I outlined... There is no reason why he couldn't have a purpose for the world (however fathoming the mind of the divine is not something I can do).\n\n \n God is impossible to completely fathom, but anyone can get closer to understanding what he is and what he wants by Biblical reading and instruction. The book of First John takes about an hour to read.\n \n \n \n \nWell, evidently, if He set the rules, then He can plan exactly what they lead to. There is a certain inevitability about evolution (read Simon Conway Morris) and geological processes, so yes the Earth could be planned out in detail, but have come about by natural processes without direct divine intervention. \n\n \n The inevitability about evolution is that it always seem to lead to atheism. The more implication there is towards \"natural processes without direct divine intervention\", there is less likelihood that planning was involved, with all the subsequent \"rules\". \n \n \n \nDoes that satisfy you?\n\n \n I'm always satisfied. emoticon_xangel",

   "If you look up polling data, you will see that 40% of American scientists believe in God, which is significantly less than the 90% of the general American population, but still far greater than your mis-stated \"1 or 2 percent\" numbers. \n\n \n \n \n \nWalking-fish:\n How do you know the percentage is that low? Even if it were, those religious evolutionists would still outnumber creationist scientists by @ 10 to 1. \n\n \n I was going by post #130 of this thread, with it's link to talkorigins. It seems to conflict with your sources. It's safe to say that most of science has political interests in atheism.\n \n \n \nSince when did Darwin assert that there can be no God to guide things along? He just stated that natural selection is a mechanism in evolution - not that God is nonexistent. And what does Richard Dawkins' outspoken atheism have to do with anything? \n\n \n Darwin didn't assert it, he implied it.

Removing gaps damages the IDists' position; removing gaps does not disprove the existence of a higher power.\n \n \nNot necessarily useless, but it may not be the only information to consider if the viewpoint involves politics.\n\n Glad to see you concede my point: it is preferable to be more informed about an issue when making a decision about said issue.

   "Scientists recently found a fossil of the transitional creature between fish and land land animals. Discovered 600 miles from the north pole, Tiktaalik roseae has limbs that are somewhere between fins and a quadrapeds limbs, and seems to have a neck structure which would allow it to lift its head to gulp air.\n \n http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/story/0,,1747926,00.html?transitionalbaby\n\n \n I would like to thank marc for reminding me of this thread and its claim by Kronus that this fish represents a missing link of sorts. I submit this link in response to the link you posted kronus. Here's an excerpt of the article.\n Tiktaalik roseae: A mosaic life form which is no evidence for evolution\n \n There are three well-preserved fossil specimens of Tiktaalik roseae. Some 3 meters long, the creature exhibits various mosaic characteristics. (Mosaic life forms contain features belonging to different groups of life forms.) As in fish, it has fins and scales. Features such as its flat head, mobile neck and relatively powerful rib structure are found in terrestrial animals. The creature, whose name is derived from the Inuit language Inuktitut and means \"a large, shallow-water fish,\" also has bones in its pectoral fins. Evolutionists distort these mosaic properties according to their own preconceptions and maintain that the animal is a transitional form between fish and terrestrial life forms.\n \n Mosaic life forms, however, are very far from being the intermediate forms required by the theory of evolution. The present-day Platypus that lives in Australia, for instance, is a mosaic creature that possesses mammalian, reptilian and avian features at one and the same time. But nothing about it constitutes any evidence for the theory of evolution. Mosaic life forms are not what evolutionists need to find in order to back up their claims; they need to find \"intermediate forms,\" which would have to be with deficient, only half-formed and not fully functional organs. Yet every one of the organs possessed by mosaic creatures is complete and flawless. They have no semi-developed organs, and there are no fossil series that can be proposed as evidence that they evolved from some other life forms.\n \n The theory of evolution hypothesizes that a process based on random mutations, in other words on chance, took place. According to this claim, the millions of living species on Earth must have evolved from a vast number of intermediate forms, all subjected to chance mutations, and as a result had deformed, abnormal structures, and the fossils of these so-called intermediate forms should have been found. To put it another way, the fossil record should be overflowing with the remains of life forms that can only be described as freaks of nature. However, this is known not to be the case. When species emerge, they do so suddenly, with all their distinguishing features fully developed, and with no series of freaks among them. In his 1999 book Fossils and Evolution, Tom Kemp, curator of Zoological Collections at the Oxford University Museum, describes the position as follows:\n \n In virtually all cases a new taxon appears for the first time in the fossil record with most definitive features already present, and practically no known stem-group forms. (Tom Kemp, Fossils and Evolution, Oxford University, Oxford University Press, 1999, p. 246)\n \n The general picture concealed by evolutionists\n \n Evolutionists attempt to give the impression that fossils actually support the idea of evolution. Yet the \"missing link\" concept is one that has been invented solely in the light of the needs of the theory of evolution and has no counterpart in the fossil record itself. The lack of fossil links alleged to connect species to one another has been known ever since Darwin's time. Excavations by paleontologists since Darwin's day have also failed to resolve this situation, which represents such a grave impasse for the theory of evolution and, on the contrary, have further confirmed the absence of any missing links among living groups.\n \n E. R. Leach, author of the book Rethinking Anthropology, wrote this in his article in Nature:\n \n Missing links in the sequence of fossil evidence were a worry to Darwin. He felt sure they would eventually turn up, but they are still missing and seem likely to remain so. (E. R. Leach; Nature, 293: 19, 1981)\n \n A. S. Romer, one of the most eminent paleontologists of his time, said this on the subject:\n \n \"Links\" are missing just where we most fervently desire them [to point to a transition between species] and it is all too probable that many \"links\" will continue to be missing. (A. S. Romer, in Genetics, Paleontology and Evolution, 1963, p. 114)\n \n David B. Kitts, professor of geology and the history of science at the University of Oklahoma admits the absence of the intermediate forms required by the theory of evolution:\n \n Evolution requires intermediate forms between species and paleontology does not provide them. (David B. Kitts, \"Paleontology and Evolutionary Theory,\" Evolution, Vol. 28, September 1974, p. 467)\n \n The picture that emerges from the fossil record is completely compatible with creation. The record reveals that living things appeared suddenly and lived for long periods of time without undergoing any change at all. These facts can clearly be seen in an evaluation of evolution's fossil impasse by the American paleontologist R. Wesson in his 1991 book Beyond Natural Selection. Stating that the gaps in the record are real, Wesson goes on to say that the absence of a record of any evolutionary branching is quite phenomenal. Species are usually static for long periods. Species and genera never show evolution into new species or genera but are replaced by another, and change is usually abrupt. (R. Wesson, Beyond Natural Selection, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1991, p. 45)\n \n Some 250,000 fossil species have been collected to date, and there is absolutely no trace of intermediate forms in any of them. Evolutionists are behaving irrationally and unscientifically by ignoring this and embarking on campaigns of missing link propaganda.\n http://www.harunyahya.com/new_releases/news/tiktaalik_roseae.php",

Discovered 600 miles from the north pole, Tiktaalik roseae has limbs that are somewhere between fins and a quadrapeds limbs, and seems to have a neck structure which would allow it to lift its head to gulp air.\n Discovered: the missing link that solves a mystery of evolution\n Alok Jha, science correspondent\n The Guardian, Thursday April 6, 2006\n Article history\n Scientists have made one of the most important fossil finds in history: a missing link between fish and land animals, showing how creatures first walked out of the water and on to dry land more than 375m years ago.\n \n Palaeontologists have said that the find, a crocodile-like animal called the Tiktaalik roseae and described today in the journal Nature, could become an icon of evolution in action - like Archaeopteryx, the famous fossil that bridged the gap between reptiles and birds.\n http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/story/0,,1747926,00.html?transitionalbaby\n\n \n \nI would like to thank marc for reminding me of this thread and its claim by Kronus that this fish represents a missing link of sorts. I submit this link in response to the link you posted kronus. Here's an excerpt of the article.\n Tiktaalik roseae: A mosaic life form which is no evidence for evolution\n \n There are three well-preserved fossil specimens of Tiktaalik roseae. Some 3 meters long, the creature exhibits various mosaic characteristics. (Mosaic life forms contain features belonging to different groups of life forms.) As in fish, it has fins and scales. Features such as its flat head, mobile neck and relatively powerful rib structure are found in terrestrial animals. The creature, whose name is derived from the Inuit language Inuktitut and means \"a large, shallow-water fish,\" also has bones in its pectoral fins. Evolutionists distort these mosaic properties according to their own preconceptions and maintain that the animal is a transitional form between fish and terrestrial life forms.\n \n Mosaic life forms, however, are very far from being the intermediate forms required by the theory of evolution. The present-day Platypus that lives in Australia, for instance, is a mosaic creature that possesses mammalian, reptilian and avian features at one and the same time. But nothing about it constitutes any evidence for the theory of evolution. Mosaic life forms are not what evolutionists need to find in order to back up their claims; they need to find \"intermediate forms,\" which would have to be with deficient, only half-formed and not fully functional organs. Yet every one of the organs possessed by mosaic creatures is complete and flawless. They have no semi-developed organs, and there are no fossil series that can be proposed as evidence that they evolved from some other life forms.\n \n The theory of evolution hypothesizes that a process based on random mutations, in other words on chance, took place. According to this claim, the millions of living species on Earth must have evolved from a vast number of intermediate forms, all subjected to chance mutations, and as a result had deformed, abnormal structures, and the fossils of these so-called intermediate forms should have been found. To put it another way, the fossil record should be overflowing with the remains of life forms that can only be described as freaks of nature. However, this is known not to be the case. When species emerge, they do so suddenly, with all their distinguishing features fully developed, and with no series of freaks among them. In his 1999 book Fossils and Evolution, Tom Kemp, curator of Zoological Collections at the Oxford University Museum, describes the position as follows:\n \n In virtually all cases a new taxon appears for the first time in the fossil record with most definitive features already present, and practically no known stem-group forms. (Tom Kemp, Fossils and Evolution, Oxford University, Oxford University Press, 1999, p. 246)\n \n The general picture concealed by evolutionists\n \n Evolutionists attempt to give the impression that fossils actually support the idea of evolution. Yet the \"missing link\" concept is one that has been invented solely in the light of the needs of the theory of evolution and has no counterpart in the fossil record itself. The lack of fossil links alleged to connect species to one another has been known ever since Darwin's time. Excavations by paleontologists since Darwin's day have also failed to resolve this situation, which represents such a grave impasse for the theory of evolution and, on the contrary, have further confirmed the absence of any missing links among living groups.\n \n E. R. Leach, author of the book Rethinking Anthropology, wrote this in his article in Nature:\n \n Missing links in the sequence of fossil evidence were a worry to Darwin. He felt sure they would eventually turn up, but they are still missing and seem likely to remain so. (E. R. Leach; Nature, 293: 19, 1981)\n \n A. S. Romer, one of the most eminent paleontologists of his time, said this on the subject:\n \n \"Links\" are missing just where we most fervently desire them [to point to a transition between species] and it is all too probable that many \"links\" will continue to be missing. (A. S. Romer, in Genetics, Paleontology and Evolution, 1963, p. 114)\n \n David B. Kitts, professor of geology and the history of science at the University of Oklahoma admits the absence of the intermediate forms required by the theory of evolution:\n \n Evolution requires intermediate forms between species and paleontology does not provide them. (David B. Kitts, \"Paleontology and Evolutionary Theory,\" Evolution, Vol. 28, September 1974, p. 467)\n http://www.harunyahya.com/new_releases/news/tiktaalik_roseae.php\n",

   "Really? It was PREDICTED in these ways prior to being found?\n\n Well... yes. Based on the location of fossils already recorded, it was possible to predict when (and thus in which region of strata) the transition to land should have occurred. It was also possible to predict to some extent what kind of features such a transitional creature should have had. And there it was. All in all a pretty good result, given that according to your competing hypothesis we should have no reason whatsoever to expect such a creature to have existed when and where it did.\n \nBut lyte, let's face it, if the Platypus had gone extinct back in the thirties for example, and the remains of one was recently found in the same basic condition as this creature, you would most assuredly be arguing with me now about how it is a 350 million year old intermediary between mammalian, reptilian and avian species,\n\n Erm, no... For a start, you can't turn bone into stone in ninety years, so finding it in the same basic condition as Tiktaalik is an impossibility.\n \nI mean, how do you explain the lungfish? If they were extinct creatures and evos found the remains, you would also be insisting that they were most definitely transitional species between fish and mammals.\n\n Not unless their remains were found in the appropriate strata.\n \nBut what is more strange is that at birth they breathe through gills like normal fish. Talk about instantaneous evolution, huh. In the course of a single lifetime they evolve from gills to lungs.\n\n Oh, AA; you really do yourself no favours you know. I do think electrolyte tends to get a bit hot and bothered but on occasion I really can't blame him. To study a subject for most of your life and then be lectured about how you know nothing by someone who can't be bothered to absorb basic facts like the difference between an species evolving and an organism growing up is pretty hard to swallow.\n \n Take a look at this. It's one of the quotes from your source:\n \nA. S. Romer, one of the most eminent paleontologists of his time, said this on the subject:\n \n \"Links\" are missing just where we most fervently desire them [to point to a transition between species] and it is all too probable that many \"links\" will continue to be missing. (A. S. Romer, in Genetics, Paleontology and Evolution, 1963, p. 114)\n\n Sounds pretty damning, doesn't it? Sounds like this eminent paleontologist is saying we have no species-species transitional fossils, doesn't it? Ok, now let's put that quote back in the context from which it was abstracted:\n \nReasons for the rarity of annectant forms may, as Simpson points out, be readily adduced. The time concerned was short; the size of the population concerned was probably small. The chances of obtaining a complete graded series (if one existed) are hence vastly less than in the case of more normal phyletic. 'Links' are missing just where we most fervently desire them, and it is all too probable that many 'links' will continue to be missing.\n\n Now, I can't force you to think critically about this, but what does it say to you about your source, that they would deliberately and knowingly twist a scientist's words to make it seem they're saying something they're not? Is that the behaviour of someone with a solid and rational opposing view?",

That is what predicted means lyte, so proffer that evidence and I will be impressed.\n\n Wow, that is what it means, and you figured it out all by yourself! Of course, your new problem is that you've promised to be \"impressed\" upon understanding what is said in Brazeau's earlier teaser post discussing Shubin and his team's expeditions. Here's his conclusion:I'm telling this story for a number of reasons. One, is that it's because I found this article some time ago, but that the results of six years of work in the arctic have not yet come to light. The artcile was written seven years ago when this expedition was being planned and the first year of several years work by Shubin and Daeschler. It's now quite dated and written quite some time before the authors ever went up. It provides perfect evidence for a 'case study' of how palaeontologists work. I'm often asked how palaeontologists know where to dig to find fossils, and this article helps give some insight as to how palaeontologists plan their expeditions.\n \n The key is that the object of the Daeschler and Shubin mission is very rare. To pinpoint where one might find such rare fossils, a lot of things have to go right: the age of the rock formation needs to be known (and correct). The type of environment it was deposited in needs to be correct. Marine-type sediments very rarely have tetrapods or their nearest relatives. Thirdly, your prediction based on the evolutionary sequence seen in the rest of the fossil record has to be accurate. In essence, multiple independent lines of historical evidence are being put to the test. Each one converges to pinpoint where the right fossils of the right type and age will be found. [emphasis original]Really, this is what you'll never be able to explain from an anti-evolution perspective.\n \n \nBut lyte, let's face it, if the Platypus had gone extinct back in the thirties for example, and the remains of one was recently found in the same basic condition as this creature, you would most assuredly be arguing with me now about how it is a 350 million year old intermediary between mammalian, reptilian and avian species, and you would be screaming that I am just too ignorant to see the obvious.\n\n I would? Really? Because there's a fossil record of platypus-like species around 350 million years old? And this specimen was found in rock about 350 million years old? If you can explain how this could be true when the organism died in the 30s, I'd like to hear it.\n \n \nIt is you who is making the fossil fit your predetermined outcome.\n\n No, Archie. The gap in the fossil record was already there. We pinpointed a specific spot where science predicted we'd find something that fills that gap. We didn't decide where the gap was after the fact, and we didn't decide what characteristics we'd expect to find after the fact; we did it beforehand. We're not \"making\" anything fit.\n \n \nSure, you say this, you insist it. You opine this with determination and a sincere fervency. But you prove nothing at all as you ignore a solid and rational opposing view of not only what might be, but of what most likely is regarding this creature.\n\n It's not a solid and rational opposing view. Despite being challenged multiple times, you haven't once posted a link to a scientific article that says that evolutionary theory predicts that we find half-formed and not-fully functional features. That's because, and listen very closely, EVOLUTIONARY THEORY MAKES NO SUCH PREDICTIONS.\n \n \nI mean, how do you explain the lungfish? If they were extinct creatures and evos found the remains, you would also be insisting that they were most definitely transitional species between fish and mammals.\n\n And we find fossils of \"lungfish\" in the Devonian. Modern species are descendants of those intermediate species.\n \n \nAfter all, they breathe through lungs and crawl on their fins. But what is more strange is that at birth they breathe through gills like normal fish. Talk about instantaneous evolution, huh. In the course of a single lifetime they evolve from gills to lungs. How do you explain that lyte?\n\n The same way I explain that amphibians start with gills and end up with lungs, and the same way I explain that you start with baby teeth and end with adult teeth: that's not evolution.

Of course, you don't actually know the source. You got that quote from a creationist site and lack the honesty to actually give a source. Are you sure that Gould said that? Here's what Gould said about people like you.\n \nSince we proposed punctuated equilibria to explain trends, it is infuriating to be quoted again and again by creationists--whether through design or stupidity, I do not know--as admitting that the fossil record includes no transitional forms. Transitional forms are generally lacking at the species level, but they are abundant between larger groups.\n\n \n Unlike you, I'll tell you where my quote comes from. It comes from one of Gould's many essays on evolution. Evolution as Fact and Theory first published in Discover Magazine in May of 1981, and republished in a collection of Gould's essays, Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes, 1983, W.W. Norton & Company, New York.\n \n So which are you. One who misrepresents Gould by design or stupidity?\n \nI know that he's tried to walk that back\nWhat does that mean? Please cite the context and the source of the quote so we know that you are not in Gould's second group.\n \n but the mere fact that someone here is trumpeting a single alleged transitional fossil is pretty much proof of his proposition. There should literally be millions of transitional fossils but instead we find \"stasis\".\nActually, we find millions of transitional fossils. Do you even know what stasis means?\n \nOn to my topic; There's a bunch of weird dolmens, menhirs, monuments, natural rock outcroppings, animal and other forms in Brittany, an area of France where evidence of unknown, ancient civilizations abound. The weird rock forms (those that are unnatural) are thought to have been created eiter by the ancient, Pagan Celts--or be even older civilizations thousands of years ago.\nHow many thousands of years ago? Supposedly, Christ lived 2000 years ago, there was a flood 4500 years ago, and the earth was created 6000 years ago. Exactly when did these civilizations abound? Obviously it had to be in the 2500 years between the flood and the birth of Christ.\n \nThey chronicled what they saw, including dinosaurs\nReally? Where can we read these chronicles? How do we know that they were talking about dinosaurs? Yet again you fail to support your assertion with any kind of source.\n \n.....meaning science was of by over 40 million years.\nWhat does \"...science was of by...\" mean? Did that make sense to you when you typed it? Is this an example of Gould's second group?\n \nThe good news is that they were not as far off as they were with Coelacanth which was supposed to be the ancestor of land animals\nWho told you that? Whoever it was lied to you. Why don't you cite your source. I will bet that it wont be a source from scientific literature, but rather a source of either deceit or ignorance, as Gould says.\n \n--but was found still swimming around.\nBut the two species of Coelacanth are only distantly related to fossil species. Every fossil example of a coelacanth ever found was a shallow water species. The two living species are deep water species. You apparently don't understand that the term \"Coelacanth\" is a reference to a relatively high level of taxonomy, an Order. Under Order there is the Family, Genus, and species. To give you an equivalent example, apes, monkeys, gibbons, bush babies, and many other families belong to the primate order, as do Homo sapiens.\n \nStrangely though, no transitional forms were found in Brittany :0)\nI suspect that neither you nor you source would recognize a \"transitional form\" if you saw it. I also suspect that with a little research I could find transitional fossils that were found in Brittany.\n \n Do you know what a transitional fossil is? I suspect not.\n \n\"So God created the Great Dragons\" Genesis 1:21 The Latin Vulgate\nHow is that meaningful? What does the Roman Catholic Church have to do with this discussion?",

   "You see snakespit, the problem with evolution is that it's a predatory science. It will jump on any fossil and attempt to fit it into the puzzle of its preconceived assumptions. Here is an article about the discovery of a creature which was known to live 400 million years ago. The only problem with that is that they have found many alive in the 20th and 21st century that are virtually identical to the known fossils of it which have been dated to the previously mentioned age.\n Darwinism-Watch.com Here's an excerpt, note the bolded:\n An interesting article appeared in the April 2003 edition of Focus magazine. More than its actual content, the interesting thing about this article was its publication in Focus, a magazine known for its devotion to the theory of evolution, yet which still carried a report about the fish known as the coelacanth, \"living proof\" that totally undermines all the claims of the theory of evolution. Even more interesting was the manner the magazine dealt with the subject. Focus had no compunctions about setting out, one by one and in the most open manner, all the blows dealt to the theory of evolution by the coelacanth. The \"astonishment\" awoken in evolutionists by this fish, and the way that it and other \"living fossils\" represent a complete dead-end for evolution were objectively described. This article, which may be regarded as a \"confession\" from the point of view of emphasizing the invalidity of the theory of evolution, genuinely dealt with the subject in a most objective manner. We hope that this attitude will continue, and we repeat the blows dealt to evolution by the coelacanth below.\n \n The coelacanth is a large fish, some 150 cm long, covered in thick scales reminiscent of armor. It belongs to the Osteichthyes class, and the earliest fossils from it are found in strata from the Devonian Period (408-350 million years). Up until 1938, a great many evolutionist zoologists assumed that the coelacanth walked on the sea bed using its two pairs of double fins, and that it represented a transitional form between land and sea creatures. As evidence for this they pointed to the bony structure of the fins in the coelacanth fossils to hand at the time. A development in 1938, however, totally overturned this intermediate species claim. A living coelacanth was caught in the waters off the Republic of South Africa! Furthermore, study of this animal, believed to have disappeared at least 70 million years ago, revealed that coelacanths had undergone absolutely no changes at all for 400 million years.\n \n The astonishment caused by this discovery is expressed in Focus magazine in these terms: \"Even the discovery of a living dinosaur would have been less surprising. Because fossils show that the coelacanth existed 150-200 million years before the appearance of the dinosaurs. The creature put forward by many scientists as the ancestor of land-dwelling vertebrates, believed to have disappeared at least 70 million years ago, had been found!\"\n \n In the years which followed, some 200 living Latimera chalumnae were caught. It was realized that these fish, which had undergone absolutely no changes, lived between 150 and 600 meters down and possessed a perfect bodily design. In 1987, Professor Hans Fricke of the Max Planck Institute descended some 200 meters off the Comores Islands, to the east of Africa, in the mini-sub Geo, and observed these creatures in their natural habitat. He saw that their bony fins had no functional connection to the protrusions which allow tetrapods (four-footed land-dwelling animals) to walk.\n \n This is how Focus magazines reports the results of this research:\n \n \"The flexible fins had no similar functions to those in four-footed land vertebrates. These allowed the creature to swim head-down and in all directions, even backwards.\"\n \n In order to better understand how a living thing which has experienced no changes for a 400 million-year period can make things so difficult for evolutionists it will be useful to have a look at some information from the fossil record. Just about all today's known phyla (the largest category used in the classification of animals) emerged in the Cambrian Period. That refers to the period between 543 and 490 million years ago. The beginning of the Cambrian period shows that the history of complex living things on earth, if we exclude single-celled and elementary multi-celled creatures, goes back some 550 million years. The period during which the coelacanth has remained unchanged therefore represents considerably more than two-thirds of that period. If life on earth emerged by evolution, how is it that this creature was able to come down to the present day, over such a long period of time, without being affected by the mutations and natural selection which are claimed to lead to evolution? Evolutionists have no answer to this. When one also considers the continental shifts that took place during these 400 million years when coelacanths remained totally unchanged, then evolutionists can be seen to be in a completely helpless position. Focus magazine writes:\n \n \"According to the scientific facts, all the continents were joined together some 250 million years ago. This enormous area of land was surrounded by a single giant ocean. Around 125 million years ago, the Indian Ocean opened up as the result of continents changing places. The volcanic caves in the Indian Ocean, which form a large part of the coelacanth's natural habitat, came about under the influence of this movement of continents. An important truth emerges in the light of all these facts. These animals, which have been in existence for some 400 million years, have remained unchanged despite the many changes in their natural environment!\"\n \n The fact that the coelacanth has undergone no evolution during this 400 million-year period openly contradicts the theory that life emerged with evolution and that living things are in a constant state of evolution.\n What is more, the coelacanth also reveals the huge gulf between land and sea creatures, which the theory of evolution links together with an imaginary transition from the one to the other. Focus magazine quotes these lines from Professor Keith S. Thomson's book The Story of the Coelacanth:\n \n \"Similarly, for instance, the oldest known Coelacanth (Diplocercides) possessed a rostral organ (the term used by zoologists to refer to the sac filled with a jelly like substance in the skull and the six tubes attached to it), a special skull articulation, a hollow spinal chord (notochord) and few teeth. In the same way that this shows that the group has remained almost unchanged since the Devonian Period (for 400 million years, it also reveals that there is a huge gap in the fossil record, since we lack the chain of ancestral fossils showing the emergence of all the common features observed in all coelacanths.\" \n Here's a photo of this 400 million year old fish who's earliest fossils of it are found in strata from the Devonian Period (408-350 million years). Now, please explain to me how a creature which has been found in 400 million year old strata could still be found alive unchanged if evolution is an accurate science? And doesn't this info also prove that the assumed ages of strata being hundreds of millions of years old is also a bunch of fiction? \n \n http://www-news.uchicago.edu/releases/07/images/070801.coelacanth2.jpg",

So that's just another proven fairy tale as forwarded by evolutionists made when they thought that they didn't have a living creature to make liars out of them. So you see trebor, evolution makes incredible claims which in most cases can't be disproved since it's only fossils we have to deal with. But when we do find living examples of the evolutionists so called scientifically sound evidence, we find the reality in no way resembles the conclusions represented.\n \n This is what I was arguing above with the Tiktaalik which your side claimed had fingers at the end of its fins. But the photo of the remains don't even show the ends of its appendages as they no linger exist. Yet your side fills in that gap as if it's a factual claim.",

Actually, there are two extant species of Coelacanth, Latimeiria chalumnae and L. menadoensis. The article that you swallow whole states that there have been no changes in the modern Coelacanths, but it doesn't state since when. Actually, there haven't been any changes noted since the modern species were discovered in 1938 and 1999, respectively. However, there are no examples of the modern species in the fossil record. None. So have they changed since other Coelacanths went extinct about 360 million years ago? Most certainly. Add to that the fact that fossil Coelacanths were all shallow water fish, while the two extant species are deep water species.\n \n In other words, there are no examples of fossil Coelacanths that are exactly like the two modern species, although there are 6 genera in the family Latimeriidae that are more similar to the Latimeiria than any other fossil in any of the other 8 families of Coelacanth. But they are not the same.\n \n Further, the fossil record of the Coelacanths is pretty extensive and spans a time between 410 ma and 360 ma with many families, genera and species. How can one possibly claim that any are unchanged?\n \nThe astonishment caused by this discovery is expressed in Focus magazine in these terms: \"Even the discovery of a living dinosaur would have been less surprising.

No one claims the either of the two modern species of Coelacanth are in any way ancestors of land-dwelling vertebrates. Such an assertion is beyond stupid. One would have to be mindless to accept and propagate such a claim. That is not to say that some Coelacanths that lived some 400 million years ago did not have transitional characteristics between fish and early tetrapods. Coelacanths were, after all, shallow water fish.\n \nHere's a photo of this 400 million year old fish who's earliest fossils of it are found in strata from the Devonian Period (408-350 million years).\nThat's just plain nonsense.

All fossils of Coelacanths are different from that fish.\n \nNow, please explain to me how a creature which has been found in 400 million year old strata could still be found alive unchanged if evolution is an accurate science?\nYou don't actually know what you are talking about, do you? I'll go over it again since you seem to be a bit slow. There are no fossils of modern Coelacanths of either species that have ever been found. All fossil Coelacanths are different in several characteristics. Thus, modern species are not \"unchanged\" from species that lived 400 million years ago. They are not the same species. Anyone who invests even a minimal amount of time in the study of Coelacanth fossils will immediately recognize that none of the 400 million year old fossils resemble the two living species.\n \nAnd doesn't this info also prove that the assumed ages of strata being hundreds of millions of years old is also a bunch of fiction?\nSince the info is wrong, no, it doesn't.

Here's the lowdown from yet another source.\n One example that amply demonstrates the accuracy of evolutionary dating and sequencing of fossil fish, or any fossil for that matter, would be the story of the coelacanth. This is a genuine fish story. For many years evolutionists had assured us that the coelacanth, a member of the crossopterygian family and a supposed link to amphibians, had most definitely been extinct for at least sixty million years, at least according to their precise methods of dating and their exact analysis of the indisputable evidence of the fossil record. No doubt about it, the coelacanth died out millennia ago along with the dinosaurs, at least until a living coelacanth was dredged up off the coast of Africa in 1938.\n \n Since then hundreds of live coelacanths have been found. In the June, 1988 National Geographic Magazine they featured numerous pictures of the coelacanth swimming around in the ocean depths, where they differ very little from the ones found entombed in the fossil layers, thus providing no evidence of any kind of evolution occurring for the coelacanth, despite the fact that the evolutionists say these fish have been swimming around for at least four hundred million years.\n \n The ancient coelacanths, from the first time they appeared in the fossil record were virtually identical to the living ones we find at the present day, extending all the way back through the geologic record past the Paleogene age of the mammals (63 million years), before the Cretaceous and Jurassic age of the dinosaurs (100 million through 225 million years ago), before the Triassic age of early mammals (200 million through 250 million years ago), before the Permian age of early reptiles (250 million through 300 million years ago), before the Carboniferous age (300 million through 370 million years ago), all the way back to the Devonian era, 400 million years ago in the fossil record, according to the time scale of the evolutionists.\n \n Initially it couldn't be admitted that a living coelacanth had appeared that was identical to a species that evolutionists had calmly assured us was extinct for so many millions of years.\n \n Thus when a live example of this extinct fish had been found, J.L.B. Smith, a chemist and ichthyologist at Rhodes University in Grahamstown University, South Africa, pronounced it an entirely new genus and species, differentfrom any coelacanth previously recorded as fossils. Smith gave the living coelacanth a very scientific name, Latimeria chalumnae, after Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer who discovered the fish, and the mouth of the Chalumna River where it was captured.\n \n Just how different is this fish from the ancient coelacanth? On pp.832 of the National Geographic article of 1988, there is a study of the comparative anatomy between the living and ancient coelacanth with this caption next to pictures of each one. They state: \"LIKE CARBON COPIES, the tail of a live coelacanth and a 140-million year-old fossil virtually match.\" \n They go on to report: \"Few creatures have endured such an immense span of time with so little change as the coelacanth. The cut-away drawing of a present-day specimen seems almost identical with the 140-million year-old fossil found in a quarry in southern West Germany. It is that extraordinary lack of change that enabled Professor J.L.B. Smith in Grahamstown to identify the coelacanth caught in South Africa in 1938 from a rough sketch, although he had never seen a live specimen.\"(30)The Fossil Record\n \n I repeat for punctuation that before the fix was in, how even the National Geographic told the truth about the fossil and the living example of the fossil. \n Just how different is this fish from the ancient coelacanth?

When males and females share the duty of rearing young, natural selection favours the same attributes in the male as in the female: unobtrusive and camouflaged to protect the chicks. But the game changes when the female rears the chicks on her own: now the male genes that get passed down most often aren't necessarily those that help the bird hide from predators, fly efficiently and live a long, quiet life, but those that get it noticed by the females. I don't know about you, but I get such a kick out of understanding things like that!

   "The fact is that my evidence directly refutes your evidence, from Dawkins to Talk Origins. You said that your link distinguished the size of 15 inches to 4.5 feet, and TO said nothing of the sort.\n\n I apologise for inadvertantly giving that impression. The actual sizes I sourced from a different link:\n \n\"Rhabdoderma, a smallish coelacanth, the size of a large minnow, is quite common in coal deposits of both Europe and North America. In the Late Triassic the extremely abundant genus Diplurus mentioned above was definitely living in freshwater lakes and rivers of North America. Also, up to this time almost all fossil coelacanths had been small fishes of less than eight to ten inches). But one species of Diplurus was much bigger (to fifteen inches).\" ~ Keith Stewart Thompson, \"Living Fossil: The Story of the Coelacanth,\" (London: Hutchinson Radius, 1991), p. 87\n\n The TO page did mention the fossils being smaller, though.\n \nIt just referred to different size. What if the fossil was a juvenile as compared to a mature adult in the living example? So your claim proves nothing by focussing only on size.\n\n It's not 'the fossil', or 'a fossil'. Eighty or so different species of fossil coelacanth have been found, with many examples of each unearthed showing a pattern of development over a large span of time. I recommend reading the 'related articles' on that page. There's no way every single one of those fossils could just happen to be a juvenile (and I think it's possible to tell that sort of thing anyway).\n \nAnd it can't be denied that evos made claims prior to living examples being found that proved evos claims regarding this so called transitional fossil were totally and completely erroneous. \n\n But why do you think the existence of modern coelacanths proves the fossil species aren't transitional? This is what I mean when I say you've got the wrong idea about evolution: you think this presents a problem even though it doesn't.\n \n You're still hung up on the idea that 'transitional' forms are somehow bad. In our discussion I think you argued that 'if evolution were true' we ought to find fossils of incomplete, useless structures - that same mistake is creeping in here: in your eyes the existence of modern coelacanths proves that their 'design' wasn't transitional (read: sub-optimal) but perfectly well adapted. Yet again, your misconceptions about evolution are your downfall. We do find incomplete structures in nature - but only as they atrophy. Ostrich wings. Mole eyes. Your Vitamin C gene. Structures that no longer serve their earlier function and are thus no longer strongly conserved. Yes, fossil coelacanths were prolific and well-adapted millions of years ago. If they hadn't been, there wouldn't have been enough of them around to leave fossils :) The same applies to any other species. I mean, look at a modern coelacanth. It's not exactly the elephant man, is it? It's a perfectly good fish. One doesn't immediately think 'well, there's no way that could have thrived for millions of years in the deep ocean'.\n \n It's like this: first there were just fish. Some shallow-water fish developed adaptations which helped them move around in really shallow waters: ie more robust fins. Some of those success stories went further and their descendants now walk the land. But others of those who experienced the first adaptations to land movement gradually migrated back out to deeper waters. Their minor adaptations didn't hurt their chances, so they thrived - and their descendants are what we find when we net a coelacanth. Yes, it's a story - just like the story that they were magicked into existence just as they are now. But my story actually explains something.\n \nThis is evidence that you guys are real good at taking a fossil, making up a great cover story which places it and categorizes it in the fossil record on the so called evolutionary tree. This fish was referred to as solid evidence of a transitional fish from the devonian period. But that's a fact you all don't want to face.\n\n I'm happy to face that fact because it remains one. Modern coelacanths are similar, but in no sense identical to those fossil remains - in the same way that modern apes are similar, but in no sense identical to fossil simians. Fossil coelacanths were freshwater insectivores, while today's examples are deep-sea carnivores.\n \nYou are expert at ignoring the mistakes, false assertions and dead ends which evolution is rife with. And as is usual, most of you resort to ignorant denials and personal attacks when faced with evidence of evos erroneous assumptions. So, in the final analysis, it remains to be seen which of us is steeped in ignorance for believing in fairy tales, and I submit it is your side which is in for a shock.\n\n AA, not long ago we spent umpteen pages going through a large number of these supposed mistakes, false assertions and dead ends, and not a single one held water. Remember endocasts? Bonobo tails? Ar/Ar dating? You flit from one 'problem' to another, and their demolition troubles you not in the slightest because they are not really what supports or fuels your hatred for the subject. They're just poo to fling at the monkeys who disagree with you. You shouldn't be too surprised when some of them, realising that's all you're doing, start flinging it back :)",

That is the true achilles heel of evolution because you take every fossil you find and put a story to it as if you actually know what you're talking about. I would love to see a list of the categorized fossils, with stories which had to be revamped and redefined, and re-categorized due to their assumption that are made based on nonexistent evidence which they claim is solid and reliable. It proves that evolution science is no more factual in reality than a fairy tale. And by you I'm speaking of evolution scientists. And there is this:\n Speculations About Coelacanths \n Fish that come under the coelacanth family were once accepted as strong evidence for transitional forms. Basing their argument on coelacanth fossils, evolutionary biologists proposed that this fish had a primitive (not completely functioning) lung. Many scientific publications stated the fact, together with drawings showing how coelacanths passed to land from water. All these rested on the assumption that the coelacanth was an extinct species.\n \n When they only had fossils of coelacanths, evolutionary paleontologists put forward a number of Darwinist assumptions regarding them; however, when living examples were found, all these assumptions were shattered.\n Below, examples of living coelacanths. The picture on the right below shows the latest specimen of coelacanth, found in Indonesia in 1998.\n \n However on December 22, 1938, a very interesting discovery was made in the Indian Ocean. A living member of the coelacanth family, previously presented as a transitional form that had become extinct 70 million years ago, was caught! The discovery of a \"living\" prototype of the coelacanth undoubtedly gave evolutionists a severe shock. The evolutionary paleontologist J. L. B. Smith said, \"If I'd meet a dinosaur in the street I wouldn't have been more astonished.\"88 In the years to come, 200 coelacanths were caught many times in different parts of the world.\n \n Living coelacanths revealed how groundless the speculation regarding them was. Contrary to what had been claimed, coelacanths had neither a primitive lung nor a large brain. The organ that evolutionist researchers had proposed as a primitive lung turned out to be nothing but a fat-filled swimbladder.89 Furthermore, the coelacanth, which was introduced as \"a reptile candidate preparing to pass from sea to land,\" was in reality a fish that lived in the depths of the oceans and never approached nearer than 180 meters from the surface.90\n \n The fundamental reason why evolutionists imagine coelacanths and similar fish to be \"the ancestor of land animals\" is that they have bony fins. They imagine that these gradually turned into feet. However, there is a fundamental difference between fish bones and the feet of land animals such as Ichthyostega: As shown in Picture 1, the bones of the coelacanth are not attached to the backbone; however, those of Ichthyostega are, as shown in Picture 2. For this reason, the claim that these fins gradually developed into feet is quite unfounded. Furthermore, the structure of the bones in coelacanth fins is very different from that in the bones in Ichthyostega feet, as seen in Pictures 3 and 4.\n \n Following this, the coelacanth suddenly lost all its popularity in evolutionist publications. Peter Forey, an evolutionary paleontologist, says in an article of his in Nature:\n \n The discovery of Latimeria raised hopes of gathering direct information on the transition of fish to amphibians, for there was then a long-held belief that coelacanths were close to the ancestry of tetrapods. ...But studies of the anatomy and physiology of Latimeria have found this theory of relationship to be wanting and the living coelacanth's reputation as a missing link seems unjustified.91\n \n This meant that the only serious claim of a transitional form between fish and amphibians had been demolished.Darwinism Refuted.com",

   "Why did you not respond to my first paragraph Peeling? That was the most telling point I made which showed what evolutionists claimed prior to knowing a living example of coelacanth existed.\n\n I didn't directly respond to the first paragraph because you reiterated the same points later and I responded to them there.\n \n First paragraph, which I skipped:\n \nYou all refuse to accept the reality of what evolution originally claimed prior to a living fish being found to still exist. And did you notice that not one of your cowardly buddies posted one bit of evidence to refute my evidence, but just personally attacked me? The only thing you guys can do in insult the intelligence of those who don't accept your gospel of evolution and your secular humanist drivel.\n\n Later content, which I responded to:\n \nThis is evidence that you guys are real good at taking a fossil, making up a great cover story which places it and categorizes it in the fossil record on the so called evolutionary tree. This fish was referred to as solid evidence of a transitional fish from the devonian period. But that's a fact you all don't want to face.\n\n \nAnd as is usual, most of you resort to ignorant denials and personal attacks when faced with evidence of evos erroneous assumptions.\n\n So I don't think I missed anything at all.\n \n Meanwhile, you haven't apologised for being wrong here:\n \nBut your link said nothing about the fossil being one size while the living fish is another. I scoured it and it just doesn't say that anywhere.\n\n Anyway, moving on:\n \nThat is the true achilles heel of evolution because you take every fossil you find and put a story to it as if you actually know what you're talking about. I would love to see a list of the categorized fossils, with stories which had to be revamped and redefined, and re-categorized due to their assumption that are made based on nonexistent evidence which they claim is solid and reliable. It proves that evolution science is no more factual in reality than a fairy tale. And by you I'm speaking of evolution scientists.\n\n What's interesting is that you perceive the process of refining theories based on new evidence as a weakness, as if there's some perverse virtue in staying wrong :)\n \n While evidence turns up all the time to help us refine and improve our understanding of the phylogenetic tree of life - and at any given time there may be conflicting theories about the detailed structure of that tree - not one piece of evidence has ever been found to suggest that there is no tree. I don't think you appreciate the significance of that.\n \nFish that come under the coelacanth family were once accepted as strong evidence for transitional forms. Basing their argument on coelacanth fossils, evolutionary biologists proposed that this fish had a primitive (not completely functioning) lung. Many scientific publications stated the fact, together with drawings showing how coelacanths passed to land from water. All these rested on the assumption that the coelacanth was an extinct species.\n\n And the fossil examples are of an extinct species. Modern coelacanths are not the same:\n \nAlthough now represented by only two known living species, as a group the coelacanths were once very successful with many genera and species that left an abundant fossil record from the Devonian to the end of the Cretaceous period, at which point they apparently suffered a nearly complete extinction. It is often claimed that the coelacanth has remained unchanged for millions of years, but, in fact, the living species and even genus are unknown from the fossil record. However, some of the extinct species, particularly those of the last known fossil coelacanth, the Cretaceous genus Macropoma, closely resemble the living species. The most likely reason for the gap is the taxon having become extinct in shallow waters. Deep-water fossils are only rarely lifted to levels where paleontologists can recover them, making most deep-water taxa disappear from the fossil record. This situation is still under investigation by scientists.\n\n Your source continues:\n \nHowever on December 22, 1938, a very interesting discovery was made in the Indian Ocean. A living member of the coelacanth family, previously presented as a transitional form that had become extinct 70 million years ago, was caught! \n\n And so the deception begins. Note he says the coelacanth family. Family is a taxonomic classification above genera, which is above species. Humans and the other great apes are in the same taxonomic family. It's impossible for a family to have ever been presented as a transitional form, so your website is attempting to deceive you. The species presented as a transitional form is not the same as the one hauled out of the Indian ocean.\n \nLiving coelacanths revealed how groundless the speculation regarding them was. Contrary to what had been claimed, coelacanths had neither a primitive lung nor a large brain. The organ that evolutionist researchers had proposed as a primitive lung turned out to be nothing but a fat-filled swimbladder.\n\n And in light of this new information the phylogenetic tree was revised, placing lungfish closer to land vertebrates.\n \n89 Furthermore, the coelacanth, which was introduced as \"a reptile candidate preparing to pass from sea to land,\" was in reality a fish that lived in the depths of the oceans and never approached nearer than 180 meters from the surface.90\n\n Another bald deception. The modern coelacanth is indeed a deep-water dweller. The fossil specimens, which are of a different species, inhabited shallow water environments.\n \nThe fundamental reason why evolutionists imagine coelacanths and similar fish to be \"the ancestor of land animals\" is that they have bony fins. They imagine that these gradually turned into feet.\n\n Well... no, actually they don't. Your source is continuing to present old theories as current. We now have a much better and more fine-grained transitional model incorporating finds like Tiktaalik.\n \nThe discovery of Latimeria raised hopes of gathering direct information on the transition of fish to amphibians, for there was then a long-held belief that coelacanths were close to the ancestry of tetrapods. ...But studies of the anatomy and physiology of Latimeria have found this theory of relationship to be wanting and the living coelacanth's reputation as a missing link seems unjustified.91\n\n All of which is true - because we now have much better evidence of a slightly different evolutionary sequence from the same time period.\n \nThis meant that the only serious claim of a transitional form between fish and amphibians had been demolished.\n\n Oh deary me, no. The evidence is stronger and the gaps smaller than ever. To put things in perspective, if the history of life on earth scientists have put together were represented by a single week in your life, the controversy engendered by modern coelacanths would equate to a slight adjustment of the technique you employed to get out of the bath on Sunday morning. \n \n 3,800,000,000 years of evolution are chiselled into the rocks of this planet, and you're all excited because a small section we made an educated guess about turned out to be slightly wrong when we found the missing piece that confirms common descent even better. Don't forget to raise a glass to Pyrrhus while you're celebrating :)",

   "So I repeat, answer my question without changing the subject if you can.\n\n Quoted for irony.\n \n Several responses to this.\n \n The first is the anthropic principle - that it is pointless to wonder at how unlikely it was that we got here, because ultimately we are here. To explain further: imagine back through your life, your parents lives, their parents lives, etc etc. If you add up all of the tiny choices that you and your ancestors have made, the chances that you will be you, right now as you are, with your personal history, are so vanishingly small as to be negligible (assuming each choice has only 2 outcomes and a very minimal 10 choices per day, and you still quickly run out of numbers). However, it would be silly to conclude that, because of this, you don't exist.\n \n The second response is smileys. The universe is a lot older than you claim. If you feel like proving your claims, feel free, but you haven't yet (and still haven't explained how we can see more than 10,000 light years away).

   "Quoted for irony.\n \n Several responses to this.\n \n The first is the anthropic principle - that it is pointless to wonder at how unlikely it was that we got here, because ultimately we are here. To explain further: imagine back through your life, your parents lives, their parents lives, etc etc. If you add up all of the tiny choices that you and your ancestors have made, the chances that you will be you, right now as you are, with your personal history, are so vanishingly small as to be negligible (assuming each choice has only 2 outcomes and a very minimal 10 choices per day, and you still quickly run out of numbers). However, it would be silly to conclude that, because of this, you don't exist.\n \n The second response is smileys. The universe is a lot older than you claim. If you feel like proving your claims, feel free, but you haven't yet (and still haven't explained how we can see more than 10,000 light years away).

   "That wasn't an answer at all that smiley offered. It proved nothing in reality happened at all. You people are so deluded you will believe anything. And you will have to be more specific regarding your link. Post the relevant part that you are using.\n\n \n Here is the relevant calculation\n \n \nRegarding the probability discussion:\n If something has a 50% chance of happening (say, a fair coin landing heads-up), then the chance of it happening at least once after n trials can be modeled by the formula P = 1 - (1 - .5)^n because each trial would cut in half the chance of the event not occurring.\n \n Therefore, if something has a 1 in 10^125 chance of happening, the probability of it happening at least once after n trials is P = 1 - (1 - 1/10^125)^n. According to my calculations, the probability of this event would reach 50% after about 6.9 x 10^124 trials and would reach 99% after 4.6 x 10^125 trials.\n \n By the way, if you want to check my work, I suggest downloading this or something similar.\n \n Now, let's consider what a \"trial\" would be in context. In order for a protein to have even the slightest chance of forming, a reasonable number of amino acids would have to be in a small area. I'll be nice and limit the number of trials per cubic millimeter at a given point in time to one hundred. I'll also assume that a maximum of one hundred chemical reaction can occur (or not occur) per second.\n \n The earth has a surface area of 510,065,600 square kilometers, 70.8% of which is water. It seems to me a fair assumption that this percentage has not changed much in the Earth's past, as the amount of land area is determined by the amount of rock light enough not to sink into the mantle. I'll make the assumption that only the top 5 kilometers got enough sunlight to sustain chemical reactions.\n \n This gives 1.8 x 10^9 cubic kilometers, or 1.8 x 10^18 cubic millimeters of space for potential trials, ignoring any space around ocean vents. Using the estimate of 100 million years (3.16 x 10^17 hundredths of a second), this gives 5.698 x 10^37 trials for Earth.\n \n The Universe is generally accepted to be 1.37 x 10^10 years old and 92 billion light-years wide. Allowing a gigayear for planets to begin forming and 20 light-years between reasonable planets gives 1.21 x 10^28 planets like earth.\n \n This gives the result of 6.93 x 10^65 trials total. The probability of this occurring is 1 in 6.93 x 10^60 according to Meyer's estimate (and ignoring several things that would make this much more likely).\n \n Using other estimates give different results.\n \n Using the first result on Google (1 in 5 x 10^19) gave me an overflow error on a calculator that is able to handle hundreds of digits. I decreased the estimate to 1 in 5 x 10^55, and it began saying that the probability of proteins having formed was 1. I had to bring the estimate down to 1 in 5 x 10^63 before it began registering anything lower than one, and it still displayed 61 nines after the decimal point.\n \n I didn't bother trying the lower estimates, such as 1 in 10113 and 1 in 1067.\n \n \n Conclusion: unless you are willing to go way overboard with your estimate, probability is not on your side. \n",

That math is only rational if all of the assumptions made for the example are exactly right. But you admittedly don't even know the exact contents of the primordial soup or any of the other conditions which existed in reality. So as interesting as your conclusions might appear to be, they are not based in reality at all. \n \n Also, you realize of course that in the natural primordial soup you're implying this experiment allegedly took place in, and assuming that each attempt actually did happen per second, that each new attempt occurred under new and different circumstances. Then, if one amino acid replicated somehow from non life that it would have to survive long enough for others to replicate, attach to it, survive long enough to grow into a single protein, which would have to grow into a string of proteins which eventually becomes simple life.\n \n Now remember that according to your own science all of this took place in an atmosphere of sulfuric acid, methane, ammonia and a lot of heat, not to mention what we don't know about in the atmosphere. You also admit that this atmosphere existed for at least a billion years as this process continued. So let's assume that 20 amino acids formed to create a living protein under those circumstances, how did it survive to grow and not be immediately zapped out of existence by the existing conditions? Here are the problems with your beliefs.\n The Primordial Soup Theory suggest that life began in a pond or ocean as a result of the combination of chemicals from the atmosphere and some form of energy to make amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, which would then evolve into all the species.\n \n The Primordial Soup Theory states that Life began in a warm pond/ocean from a combination of chemicals that forms amino acids, which then make proteins. This is suppose to happen at least 3.8 billion to 3.55 billion years ago.\n \n The Russian Chemist A.I. Oparin and English Geneticist J.B.S. Haldane first conceived of this idea. Both developed this theory independently in 1920.\n \n In this theory, the basic building blocks of life came from simple molecule which formed in the atmosphere (w/o oxygen). This was then energized by lightning and the rain from the atmosphere created the \"organic soup\". The first organisms would have to be simple heterotrophs in order to survive by consuming other organisms for energy before means of photosynthesis. They would become autotrophs by mutation. Evidence now suggest the first organisms were autotrophs\n \n Chemist Stanley Miller and physicist Harold Urey did a famous experiment in 1950 to test this theory. They mixed gases thought to be present on primitive earth:\n \n \n Methane (CH4)\n \n Ammonia (NH3)\n \n Water (H2O)\n \n Hydrogen (H2)\n \n No Oxygen\n They then electrically sparked the mixture to signify lightning. The results were amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. It was later discovered that other energies also can excite gases and produce all 20 amino acids:\n \n \n Electricity\n \n Ultraviolet light\n \n Heat\n \n Shock\n Problems with theory\n \n 1. Amino acids have to become protein\n \n a. 1 protein = 100amino acids of 20 varieties\n \n b. 10130 combinations of amino acids\n \n c. Hard to hit the right protein by accident\n \n d. Amino acids are building blocks, not the assembled structure\n \n 2. Early atmosphere contain different gases than those used by Miller/Urey\n \n a. No ammonia and methane\n \n b. Not reduced (opposite of oxidized)\n \n c. Experiments with true atmospheric gases did not produce abundant amino acids\n \n 3. 2nd Law of Thermodynamics\n \n a. System becomes less and less organized over time\n \n b. Means amino acids cannot form protein spontaneously (more and more organized)\n \n 4. Primordial soup too dilute to achieve anything\n \n a. Cannot spontaneously generate proteins\n \n b. No mechanism to concentrate and make protein\n \n \n \n This theory emphasize metabolism because of the cooperative group of molecules and how they gain and use energy and molecules.\n \n In an experiment by Sidney Fox, heated amino acids drove\n out water as steam and made peptide chains. They were Proteinoids though, very different from real proteins.\n Primordial Soup Theory\n \n \n this is proper information for the probability for a short protein with only 200 amino acids. It isn't even complex life yet, and the numbers and percentages are accurate. Why are you ignoring them?\n Here are the crucial numbers:\n \n Proteins vary in length from strings of a few hundred to a few thousand amino acids. Consider a relatively short protein, such as 200 amino acids long. Into each of the 200 spaces any one of the 20 amino acids can fall. That means the total number of possible combinations is 20 times 20 times 20 repeated 200 times. The result is a one with 260 zeros after it, or 10 to the power of 260 or a billion billion billion repeated 29 times. From this vast biological grab bag, we are told that nature by random chance mutations has been able to form the fewer than a million proteins that don't kill the organism. This did not, and could not, and will not happen by chance. And every biologist enamored with neo-Darwinian evolution knows it. Their feeble reply is that there must be other factors that limit the types of mutations that can occur. There certainly are&#8230;but not as randomly as the materialist biologist would have it.\n \n The unrealistic possibility that the selection of viable proteins could have occurred by unguided random mutations in the DNA led Simon Conway Morris, professor of evolutionary paleobiology at Cambridge University, Fellow of the Royal Society of England, and possibly the world's leading paleontologist, to write his book, Life's Solutions (Cambridge University Press, 2003). In it we read: \"Life is simply too complex to be assembled by random reactions on any believable time scale. &#8230; evolution [has the] uncanny ability to find the short cuts across the multidimensional hyperspace of biological reality. &#8230;\"\n Tothesource\n \n So basically, this whole debate is moot since the very premise upon which it is based is an absolutely impossible one in which to base a theory. Now go ahead and attack this sites facts.\n \n [This info has been used in another debate currently posted on this site.]\n",

   "Like I said, I'm attempting to reason with philosophical cowards who must attack the source and the poster when they can't refute the evidence. Especially since my link say's this, and I quote: Chemist Stanley Miller and physicist Harold Urey did a famous experiment in 1950 to test this theory. They mixed gases thought to be present on primitive earth:\n  The site admits they used gasses they THOUGHT TO BE PRESENT ON PRIMITIVE EARTH. If anyone has a more recent widely accepted experiment then feel free to post it. But the reality is that my info is based on the Primordial Soup Theory which states that Life began in a warm pond/ocean from a combination of chemicals that forms amino acids, which then make proteins. \n \n This is supposed to have happened at least 3.8 billion to 3.55 billion years ago. We all know that since 1950, the estimated age has moved to around 4.5 billion years ago. We also know the moving of that goal post isn't based on any factual discoveries but solely on the fact that scientists know that 3.5 billion years wasn't enough time for their math to mesh with the perceived problems with their assumptions and claims. And what's wrong with the problems they point out?\n \n Problems with theory\n \n 1. Amino acids have to become protein\n \n a. 1 protein = 100amino acids of 20 varieties\n \n b. 10130 combinations of amino acids\n \n c. Hard to hit the right protein by accident\n \n d. Amino acids are building blocks, not the assembled structure\n \n 2. Early atmosphere contain different gases than those used by Miller/Urey\n \n a. No ammonia and methane\n \n b. Not reduced (opposite of oxidized)\n \n c. Experiments with true atmospheric gases did not produce abundant amino acids\n \n 3. 2nd Law of Thermodynamics\n \n a. System becomes less and less organized over time\n \n b. Means amino acids cannot form protein spontaneously (more and more organized)\n \n 4. Primordial soup too dilute to achieve anything\n \n a. Cannot spontaneously generate proteins\n \n b. No mechanism to concentrate and make protein\n \n This theory emphasize metabolism because of the cooperative group of molecules and how they gain and use energy and molecules.\n \n In an experiment by Sidney Fox, heated amino acids drove\n out water as steam and made peptide chains. They were Proteinoids though, very different from real proteins.\n \n Note the bolded. Why do you people reject any facts that contradict your preconceived notions? Not very scientifically minded of you, you know. emoticon_confused\n\n \n Well, they showed that amino acids can form with gasses and electricity. You seem to think that those experiments was the start all and end all of all experiments. Further experiments show that amino acids (and more varieties) happen with a wide range of different gasses. Furthermore, we had direct data on organic chemicals in the atmosphere of another planet with an atmosphere that was considered similar to the early earth. The atmosphere of titan has a tremendous amount of amino acids and other organic compounds in it. This shows, when conditions are anywhere near right, amino acids and other organic chemicals form, quite naturally and in many diverse environments. Creationists look at the first experiment, and fail to look at the following 50 years where knowledge was confirmed and refined. \n \n Now, having shown your Miller experiment.\n \n Now, let's address your 'probablity' arguement.\n \n First of all, chemistry is not random. It follows some very precise rules. Some very complex organic compounds have been shown to have been formed in outer space. \n \n Next, when it comes to the protein. that is for a specific protien molecule to form by random chance. However, that doesn't take into account the following factors.\n \n The modern protein molecules have been under the selection of random variation followed by the filter of natural selection. The earliest forms of life would have had much simpiler forms of proteins. Complexity increased by RVNS. accumulative chance, and filters were applied. \n \n In a world wide environment full of organic materials, there are many many chances of simple replicating molecules to occur.

Instead, have some up-to-date news (huzzah for my Google News addiction!) \n \n The Miller Experiment Revisited\n \n For more news articles on the same topic, I recommend Google News\n\n \n Interesting links. They clearly show that by posting Millers experiment, I focussed in on the go to experiment of the period for the study for the creation of original life on Earth. And yet I have been excoriated by tq and trebor for even bringing attention to it. But of course they reject anything I post out of hand under the assumption it can't help their cause. \n \n But iangb, your links all say basically the same thing which is: Volcanic eruptions and subsequent release of gases may have produced necessary chemical components that triggered the first spark of life, ... So again, we are left with a hopeful theory which is grasping at straws in the hope of discovering how original life first appeared on Earth. And none of this deals with the massive probabilities against it having happened that way. \n \n The reality is that we have absolutely no idea precisely what chemicals existed on a primordial earth. And the fact is that without that precise information, it is impossible to run experiment that would produce realistic and credible results. And don't forget, the goal is to create complex life forms. Not just proteins and enzymes and amino acids. They must work together to create actual living creatures as we have now in our complex ecosystems of varied and diverse species of life, from insects all the way up to human beings, including all vegetation and the earth which sustains it. And what is most incredible about this world and is most impossible to reproduce in my opinion, is the symbiotic chain of life which is so interdependent upon the creatures below them and beside them for continued survival. \n \n Also, imagine that a microscopic bacterium responding to a local sugar gradient for example, is responding to its environment as much as a lion is responding to its environment when it searches for food in the African savannah. For any given species, behaviors can be co-operative, aggressive, parasitic or symbiotic. Matters become more complex when two or more different species interact in an ecosystem. Studies of this type are the province of ecology. When we take this into account when considering a primordial earth , then just imagine how violent the microbial response would have been towards an invading organism which you allege spontaneously generated, and not only survived but co-operated with what most likely would have been an invading organism to it. \n \n Even if we forget about the radical environmental conditions and all of the deadly chemicals in the atmosphere, it is impossible to calculate the pressures on it and the odds against any single resulting protein to survive long enough to replicate itself enough to not only become simple life, but complex life as we have in the real world today. And nothing anyone has shown here changes the probabilities against spontaneous generation having occurred no matter how many billions of year you allow for.",

'organic chemistry' doesn't have to do with life, but rather it has to do with chemistry with the chemicals.. From wiki\n \n \n\n Organic chemistry\n From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n Jump to: navigation, search\n \n Organic chemistry is a discipline within chemistry which involves the scientific study of the structure, properties, composition, reactions, and preparation (by synthesis or by other means) of chemical compounds consisting primarily of carbon and hydrogen, which may contain any number of other elements, including nitrogen, oxygen, the halogens as well as phosphorus, silicon and sulfur.[1][2] [3]\n \n The original definition of \"organic\" chemistry came from the misconception that organic compounds were always related to life processes. However, organic molecules can be produced by processes not involving life. Life as we know it also depends on inorganic chemistry. For example, many enzymes rely on transition metals such as iron and copper; and materials such as shells, teeth and bones are part organic, part inorganic in composition. Apart from elemental carbon, only certain classes of carbon compounds (such as oxides, carbonates, and carbides) are conventionally considered inorganic. Biochemistry deals mainly with the natural chemistry of biomolecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, and sugars.\n \n Because of their unique properties, multi-carbon compounds exhibit extremely large variety and the range of application of organic compounds is enormous. They form the basis of, or are important constituents of many products (paints, plastics, food, explosives, drugs, petrochemicals, to name but a few) and (apart from a very few exceptions) they form the basis of all earthly life processes.\n \n The different shapes and chemical reactivities of organic molecules provide an astonishing variety of functions, like those of enzyme catalysts in biochemical reactions of live systems.\n \n Current (as of 2008) trends in organic chemistry include chiral synthesis, green chemistry, microwave chemistry, fullerenes and microwave spectroscopy.\n \n\n \n So, you are using the logical fallacy of equivocation there. And, I never said you were stupid.. I was just pointing out where your ignorance lay. On the other hand, if you wish to think you are stupid, you know yourself better than I do.",

In fact, I don't think it'll take me that long.\n \n Firstly, as Jo stated in another thread, there is no law of probability that states that something which is very improbable is actually impossible.\n\n \n This might be true on a purely technical level. But as a rational and a realistic rule, when the total number of possible combinations is 20 times 20 times 20 repeated 200 times. The result is a one with 260 zeros after it, or 10 to the power of 260 or a billion billion billion repeated 29 times. and that's only for a short protein only 200 amino acids long, that mathematical probability factor pretty much means that the chance of complex life coming about by way of random mutation through this process is infinitely improbable. And that my friend, is an undeniable mathematical fact once you extend these probabilities to even the simplest complex organism like a small fish which has a brain the size of a pea. \n \n \nSecondly, all that are needed to be created are the first, simple molecules, more complex proteins can form from these initial few amino acids. Hence the term, 'building blocks of life'.\n\n \n And then, if they do spontaneously generate from non life in this alleged primordial soup, they must not only survive, but replicate over this billion or so years that it's mixing. It then must self replicate and grow into more complex life while cooperating with all of the other predatory organisms which are trying to consume it or will simply treat it as an invading organism and kill it. Again, what are the realistic probabilities of it ever getting a foothold? I mean we have 7 other planets in this solar system but not one of them has sprouted life that is recognizable on any level of the definition. \n \n And I'm not requiring a carbon based life form as we work under here on Earth, it could be a silicone or gaseous or crystalline based life form for all I care. Yet none exists at all in spite that they have also had multiple billions of years to evolve life.\n \n \nThirdly, if we knew exactly how life formed then we wouldn't be having this argument at all - we could just go and tell you to read a textbook. Instead, theories/hypothesis are continually being put forward that, so far, seem plausible. Discounting them entirely on the grounds that 'we can't know if they are exactly correct' is unscientific, and shows your agenda quite badly.\n\n \n OK iangb, let's accept your premise for a second, and one question comes to mind. Let's consider Millers experiment which a second look at has caused so much excitement in the scientific community. And let's assume that the results are exactly as claimed which until they are repeated numerous times for confirmation leaves a huge question mark surrounding their credibility. Because remember, all they have done is taken a second look at his results with more modern, more sophisticated scientific equipment, they haven't replicated his experiments.\n \n But as I said, assuming the results are true and accurate, here's the untenable problem that remains. How do we know that the chemicals he used are in any way similar in volume or percentages or the conditions of what existed during Earths primordial period? And how do we assume that at least all of the elements of the periodic table weren't present in that primordial soup during that period? The Periodic Table of the Elements, Standard Form\n \n In fact iangb, how naive is it to first run an experiment using only 4 of the 118 existing elements we know are found on Earth, in laboratory conditions, and then declare that we have accomplished anything valid or real based on such an outcome. Forget that as an oxygen based world, no oxygen was used in the experiment. It is obvious to me that scientists are attempting to create any experiment what so ever which will produce the desired outcome, and then it will proudly exclaim, we have discovered how life first appeared on Earth from non life. WE HAVE FINALLY BROKEN THE CODE OF LIFE, THEY WILL PROCLAIM. It will make no difference to them that all they have accomplished is a very limited science experiment in a lab that has no basis in reality at all.\n \n \nTo summarise: the numbers I posted before shows that it is massively likely (practically a certainty) for simple amino acids to form, and from these simple organic molecules more complex chains could form, and eventually... life.

You know, by actually producing evidence of something? Or by responding to my rational and reasoned arguments with equally reasoned rebuttals? To start, try responding to this if you can. Or is actually debating the issues beyond you since all you can do is insult me?\n \n \nI have ,more time now... time to cover some points. In fact, I don't think it'll take me that long.\n \n Firstly, as Jo stated in another thread, there is no law of probability that states that something which is very improbable is actually impossible.\n\n \n This might be true on a purely technical level. But as a rational and a realistic rule, when the total number of possible combinations is 20 times 20 times 20 repeated 200 times. The result is a one with 260 zeros after it, or 10 to the power of 260 or a billion billion billion repeated 29 times. and that's only for a short protein only 200 amino acids long, that mathematical probability factor pretty much means that the chance of complex life coming about by way of random mutation through this process is infinitely improbable. And that my friend, is an undeniable mathematical fact once you extend these probabilities to even the simplest complex organism like a small fish which has a brain the size of a pea. \n \n \nSecondly, all that are needed to be created are the first, simple molecules, more complex proteins can form from these initial few amino acids. Hence the term, 'building blocks of life'.\n\n \n And then, if they do spontaneously generate from non life in this alleged primordial soup, they must not only survive, but replicate over this billion or so years that it's mixing. It then must self replicate and grow into more complex life while cooperating with all of the other predatory organisms which are trying to consume it or will simply treat it as an invading organism and kill it. Again, what are the realistic probabilities of it ever getting a foothold? I mean we have 7 other planets in this solar system but not one of them has sprouted life that is recognizable on any level of the definition. \n \n And I'm not requiring a carbon based life form as we work under here on Earth, it could be a silicone or gaseous or crystalline based life form for all I care. Yet none exists at all in spite that they have also had multiple billions of years to evolve life.\n \n \nThirdly, if we knew exactly how life formed then we wouldn't be having this argument at all - we could just go and tell you to read a textbook. Instead, theories/hypothesis are continually being put forward that, so far, seem plausible. Discounting them entirely on the grounds that 'we can't know if they are exactly correct' is unscientific, and shows your agenda quite badly.\n\n \n OK iangb, let's accept your premise for a second, and one question comes to mind. Let's consider Millers experiment which a second look at has caused so much excitement in the scientific community. And let's assume that the results are exactly as claimed which until they are repeated numerous times for confirmation leaves a huge question mark surrounding their credibility. Because remember, all they have done is taken a second look at his results with more modern, more sophisticated scientific equipment, they haven't replicated his experiments.\n \n But as I said, assuming the results are true and accurate, here's the untenable problem that remains. How do we know that the chemicals he used are in any way similar in volume or percentages or the conditions of what existed during Earths primordial period? And how do we assume that at least all of the elements of the periodic table weren't present in that primordial soup during that period? The Periodic Table of the Elements, Standard Form\n \n In fact iangb, how naive is it to first run an experiment using only 4 of the 118 existing elements we know are found on Earth, in laboratory conditions, and then declare that we have accomplished anything valid or real based on such an outcome. Forget that as an oxygen based world, no oxygen was used in the experiment. It is obvious to me that scientists are attempting to create any experiment what so ever which will produce the desired outcome, and then it will proudly exclaim, we have discovered how life first appeared on Earth from non life. WE HAVE FINALLY BROKEN THE CODE OF LIFE, THEY WILL PROCLAIM. It will make no difference to them that all they have accomplished is a very limited science experiment in a lab that has no basis in reality at all.\n \n \nTo summarise: the numbers I posted before shows that it is massively likely (practically a certainty) for simple amino acids to form, and from these simple organic molecules more complex chains could form, and eventually... life. Miller's experiment confirms this by showing empirically that this could have happened. To discard the calculations on the grounds that 'the numbers are not precise enough' is nonsensical - the fact remains that the numbers are roughly correct, and any small factor of error would be swamped by the vastness of the numbers themselves. \n\n \n Note the bolded iangb. do you see what you have done here?

And that my friend, is an undeniable mathematical fact once you extend these probabilities to even the simplest complex organism like a small fish which has a brain the size of a pea.\n\n It's not an undeniable mathematical fact - the undeniable mathematical fact would be that odds of 1 to [a very large number] is still possible - it will happen, on average, once in [a very large number] of times.\n \n However, the later calculations that I linked to showed that the number of times the trial is carried out (will the right chain form) is even vaster. Yes, I know you dispute the figures, but I'll get to that in a minute. First though, an analogy.\n \n Imagine you had a million-sided dice. The chances of throwing a 6 on that dice are tiny - a million to one. However, if you throw that dice a million times, the chance that you will get a 6 one or more times is a massive 63%. That your initial probability is tiny does not matter, as long as you have enough trials.\n \n \nAnd then, if they do spontaneously generate from non life in this alleged primordial soup, they must not only survive, but replicate over this billion or so years that it's mixing. It then must self replicate and grow into more complex life while cooperating with all of the other predatory organisms which are trying to consume it or will simply treat it as an invading organism and kill it.\nYou're missing several key facts here.\n \n Firstly, an amino acid is not 'life'. An amino acid is an organic molecule, a feature it shares with (for example) petrol and plastic. It will mix by convection currents and brownian motion, just like all other liquid particles. For it to become 'life', it will need to get a lot more complex - largely by random collision/interaction with other amino acids, and possibly with the natural aid of a surface that naturally replicates, such as mineral crystals or clay walls.\n \n Once it becomes 'life', it need not fear 'other predatory organisms'. Remember, we're talking here about the first life ever to exist. Any other life forms spontaneously created are unlikely to come into contact with it for many, may millennia - if other forms are even created. Most likely, is that just one life form will start the chain - on earth, this was believed to be 'cyanobacteria', aka 'blue-green algae' - google it if you want. This is unbelievably simple - it wouldn't recognise an 'invading organism' if you dropped it in a puddle of them, it simply hadn't had the time or the necessity to evolve anything.\n \n Again, what are the realistic probabilities of it ever getting a foothold? I mean we have 7 other planets in this solar system but not one of them has sprouted life that is recognizable on any level of the definition.\n \n And I'm not requiring a carbon based life form as we work under here on Earth, it could be a silicone or gaseous or crystalline based life form for all I care. Yet none exists at all in spite that they have also had multiple billions of years to evolve life.\nWe don't know much about most of the planets in our solar system. Even mars, our nearest, may contain some life - we simply don't know yet. However, Earth is the best suited for carbon reactions to take place - and carbon or silicone life-forms are pretty much the only way to go, due to the way the atoms bond together. I'm sure you've heard of the 'goldilocks zone' that earth is in - not to hot, not too cold, stable landmasses, liquid water, and with a handy moon to protect us from large asteroids. No-where else in the Solar System has that - but many other planets out there might. See the calculations, again.\n \n Finally - taking your experience from a mere 8 other planets isn't a very representative sample. If the universe is 1/9 populated, we're in for a surprise.\n \n Oh, and 'gasious, or crystaline life forms' would still be carbon or silicone. And unlikely.\n \n \nHow do we know that the chemicals he used are in any way similar in volume or percentages or the conditions of what existed during Earths primordial period? And how do we assume that at least all of the elements of the periodic table weren't present in that primordial soup during that period? The Periodic Table of the Elements, Standard Form\n \n In fact iangb, how naive is it to first run an experiment using only 4 of the 118 existing elements we know are found on Earth, in laboratory conditions, and then declare that we have accomplished anything valid or real based on such an outcome. Forget that as an oxygen based world, no oxygen was used in the experiment.

WE HAVE FINALLY BROKEN THE CODE OF LIFE, THEY WILL PROCLAIM. It will make no difference to them that all they have accomplished is a very limited science experiment in a lab that has no basis in reality at all.\nFirstly, as I've said before, that we cannot know if Miller used the correct method to create his acids or not is irrelevant. Millers experiment showed that it is possible that amino acids can be spontaneously generated - something which you initially challenged.\n \n There's some major scientific knowledge you seem to be missing again. The 'four elements' that Miller used were (compounds of) nitrogen (ammonia), oxygen (water), hydrogen (everything) and carbon (methane). As a representation of the earth's early atmosphere goes (especially in volcanoes - see that first article I linked to), it's quite good. Other elements would not prevent the amino acids from forming, they would just form secondary bi-products - and a large proportion of the PT is very rare on earth.\n \n In short - the gases used were an adequate model. Perhaps not precise, but this is impossible to attain - and irrelevant, as the right conditions could arise.\n \n \nMy question to your SCIENTIFIC MIND is this, if the numbers upon which the calculations are based are fictional, then of what benefit are the results in reality?\nThe numbers are fictional, but are based in fact. If I multiply 5 billion by 3 million, instead of 5 billion and 1 by 3 million, there will be a difference - but it will be so small as to be irrelevant.\n The poster didn't know the exact figures to use - no-one does. Instead, he used an appropriate approximation, which is all that was needed. The slight errors that he could have included would not have changed the outcome at all.\n \n The scientific way of putting this is 'errors were present in the calculation, but were negligible'\n \nConsidering another angle of rationale, If the experiment is based on around 4 out of all of the elements found on Earth, using electricity rather than true lightning which has also been proven to be unique from electricity in its chemical makeup, then how do we claim any success at all in proving anything real and substantial? The fact remains that nothing attempted was even based on real world conditions that we can affirm in any way.\n\n The experiment used real-world conditions. It used 4 compounds that are predominate in certain parts of the world and a spark - which is completely analagous to lightning ('lightning has a chemical makeup'? That's some major lack of knowledge). It's impossible to be more precise - and it wouldn't affect the outcome if it was.\n \n \nMiller's experiment is just that. AN EXPERIMENT. The question is, is it based on realistic conditions? And the answer to that is absolutely not. As one with a terminally inquisitive mind as you claim to have, I would hope that the ultimate factual truth is your goal. Then why are you compromising those ethics for the sake of such limited science?

But you and I both know that Millers experiment in no way reproduced those conditions in any way, shape or form.\n\n I'm going over old ground here. The only thing I would add is - in what specific ways would you improve the experiment? \n \n The experiment was a valid model of conditions in certain parts of earth. The calculation was a valid model of probability. Neither were absolutely precise, but extra precision would not have affected the outcome.",

   "It's not an undeniable mathematical fact - the undeniable mathematical fact would be that odds of 1 to [a very large number] is still possible - it will happen, on average, once in [a very large number] of times.\n \n However, the later calculations that I linked to showed that the number of times the trial is carried out (will the right chain form) is even vaster. Yes, I know you dispute the figures, but I'll get to that in a minute. First though, an analogy.\n \n Imagine you had a million-sided dice. The chances of throwing a 6 on that dice are tiny - a million to one. However, if you throw that dice a million times, the chance that you will get a 6 one or more times is a massive 63%. That your initial probability is tiny does not matter, as long as you have enough trials.\n\n \n Let's make your analogy a little more realistic shall we? Imagine it has 10^-260 sides to it, now how long will it take to hit 200 6s? Maybe 10 billion years, maybe longer? But wait, in order for one protein 200 amino acids long to lead to life on this planet, it needed to happen in the first billion years. And it is undeniable that the accurate probabilities given put the odds against you being right that it happened at all.\n \n \nFirstly, an amino acid is not 'life'. An amino acid is an organic molecule, a feature it shares with (for example) petrol and plastic. It will mix by convection currents and brownian motion, just like all other liquid particles. For it to become 'life', it will need to get a lot more complex - largely by random collision/interaction with other amino acids, and possibly with the natural aid of a surface that naturally replicates, such as mineral crystals or clay walls.\n \n Once it becomes 'life', it need not fear 'other predatory organisms'. Remember, we're talking here about the first life ever to exist. Any other life forms spontaneously created are unlikely to come into contact with it for many, may millennia - if other forms are even created. Most likely, is that just one life form will start the chain - on earth, this was believed to be 'cyanobacteria', aka 'blue-green algae' - google it if you want. This is unbelievably simple - it wouldn't recognise an 'invading organism' if you dropped it in a puddle of them, it simply hadn't had the time or the necessity to evolve anything.\n\n \n I know that amino acids aren't life. The amino acid composition in these reactions is hetero-chiral. The emergence of homochirality can theoretically become spontaneous in adequate, far-from-equilibrium systems, but only in the presence of energy flows. Whether these &#8220;adequate systems&#8221; were present in prebiotic condition is unknown and experiments are needed to prove it is even possible.\n \n Assuming that enough amino acids were present in the primordial soup, what next? Amino acids polymerize to form polypeptides and proteins with the help of mRNA, tRNA, peptidyl transferases and ribosomes under very specific pH, temperature and osmotically regulated conditions within a cell. Under preobiotic conditions, some sort of catalyst is needed to facilitate peptide-bond formation in water.\n \n Chessari et al. (2006) described an experimental procedure to mimic the formation of 44 peptide long cooligopetide sequences in many identical copies which may have occurred in the prebiotic molecular evolution. However, the synthesis of the peptides fragments used in the experiment where synthesized based on the Merrifield solid-phase synthesis of peptides, hardly prebiotic plausible scenarios.\n \n But let&#8217;s suppose polymerization is not a problem. We find a peptide sequence that is capable of efficiently amplifying homochiral products from a racemic mixture of peptide fragments through a chiroselective autocatalytic cycle. The Ghadiri protein. How was this achieved? A pool of two peptides, one 17 amino acids long and the other is 15 amino acids was added to a controlled mixture\n Sequences:\n arg-met-lys-gln-lys-glu-glu-lys-val-tyr-glu-lys-lys-ser-lys-val-ala\n cys-leu-glu-tyr-glu-val-ala-arg-leu-lys-lys-leu-val-gly-glu\n \n The peptide sequences need to be exact for the experiment to work, otherwise no replication will occur. A constant supply of the two specific peptide sequences was added to the experiment. Every possible strategy of interference was employed by the investigator to promote replication. What are the odds of forming a pool of peptides of this length with those exact sequences in a prebiotic environment, all in a close vicinity to each other and simultaneously considering the following?\n Chemical Stability\n Chemical Reactivity\n Chemical Selectivity\n \n The odds are astronomical as has been pointed out so the protein world has its problems as far as the prebiotic world is concerned. \n Telic Meme: Abiogenesis: The formation of life from non-life\n \n \nWe don't know much about most of the planets in our solar system. Even mars, our nearest, may contain some life - we simply don't know yet. However, Earth is the best suited for carbon reactions to take place - and carbon or silicone life-forms are pretty much the only way to go, due to the way the atoms bond together. I'm sure you've heard of the 'goldilocks zone' that earth is in - not to hot, not too cold, stable landmasses, liquid water, and with a handy moon to protect us from large asteroids. No-where else in the Solar System has that - but many other planets out there might. See the calculations, again.\n \n Finally - taking your experience from a mere 8 other planets isn't a very representative sample. If the universe is 1/9 populated, we're in for a surprise.\n\n \n Do you see what you're doing iangb? You're grasping at straws in the hope that some irrelevant microscopic life will someday be found on another planet as if that would prove something. I'm saying that intelligent life could just look from a couple of light years away or further and see this blue green marble glowing and teeming with life. We've done flyby's of every planet in our solar system and they know their is no obvious life to speak of. And as for mars, the rovers found nothing and they bored down looking for it.\n \n \nOh, and 'gasious, or crystaline life forms' would still be carbon or silicone. And unlikely.\n\n \n Really? Prove it! You have no idea what the basic compounds are that would structure life on alien planets. We know they wouldn't breathe oxygen as we do. If life formed on Titan, it would breathe methane. So what would it lungs and skin look like if it survived on an ice ball like that? The answer is we have no clue yet you speak so matter of factly as if this world is the standard by which other worlds should be judged. For scientific minds, you people don't do well thinking outside the box. \n \n \nFirstly, as I've said before, that we cannot know if Miller used the correct method to create his acids or not is irrelevant. Millers experiment showed that it is possible that amino acids can be spontaneously generated - something which you initially challenged.\n \n There's some major scientific knowledge you seem to be missing again. The 'four elements' that Miller used were (compounds of) nitrogen (ammonia), oxygen (water), hydrogen (everything) and carbon (methane). As a representation of the earth's early atmosphere goes (especially in volcanoes - see that first article I linked to), it's quite good. Other elements would not prevent the amino acids from forming, they would just form secondary bi-products - and a large proportion of the PT is very rare on earth.\n \n In short - the gases used were an adequate model. Perhaps not precise, but this is impossible to attain - and irrelevant, as the right conditions could arise.\n\n \n This whole way of thinking is a conversation ender as far as I'm concerned. You have just admitted that any combination of gasses that gave you the desired results would be accepted as evidence of spontaneous life generating from non life in reality. We don't even know whether these &#8220;adequate systems&#8221; were present in prebiotic conditions, and since it is unknown, experiments are needed to prove it is even possible. But that isn't even an issue for you apparently. Why worry about details, right? Sheesh iangb, you have zero respect for the true intent of the scientific method which explains why you believe this trash.\n \n \nThe numbers are fictional, but are based in fact. If I multiply 5 billion by 3 million, instead of 5 billion and 1 by 3 million, there will be a difference - but it will be so small as to be irrelevant.\n The poster didn't know the exact figures to use - no-one does. Instead, he used an appropriate approximation, which is all that was needed. The slight errors that he could have included would not have changed the outcome at all.\n \n The scientific way of putting this is 'errors were present in the calculation, but were negligible'\n \n The experiment used real-world conditions. It used 4 compounds that are predominate in certain parts of the world and a spark - which is completely analagous to lightning ('lightning has a chemical makeup'? That's some major lack of knowledge). It's impossible to be more precise - and it wouldn't affect the outcome if it was.\n\n \n The numbers are fictional, but based in fact? Do you think about what you write before you write it? Answer me this iangb, what if none of those compounds were present in a prebiotic earth? Prove for me they were present! Can't you see that this whole debate is hypothetical as we don't know anything for certain? Yet your side has been making incredible claims based on lab experiments which wer based on a theory conceived of by a scientist in the 20s. Google primordial soup to check that. \n \n But since that sounded reasonable, scientists picked up the ball and ran with it. and now, to you it's based on fact.\n \n \nI'm going over old ground here. The only thing I would add is - in what specific ways would you improve the experiment?\n \n \n I would build a time machine. Beside that, there is no way of knowing anything that happened this alleged 4+ billion years ago FOR CERTAIN FROM OUR CURRENT PERSPECTIVE. After all, I know that God spoke creation into being, so I would go back just to see what existed then. \n \n \nThe experiment was a valid model of conditions in certain parts of earth. The calculation was a valid model of probability. Neither were absolutely precise, but extra precision would not have affected the outcome.\n\n \n Again, prove it was a valid model of condition in our prebiotic world, and prove that not being precise woudn't have any effect on the outcome? I can't even believe you would dare say such a thing as you claim to respect scientific methodology.",

And it is undeniable that the accurate probabilities given put the odds against you being right that it happened at all.\n\n Not so. If proteins could have occurred in 10 billion years (as you say), then they probably could have occurred in 1 billion - it's only a factor of ten difference between the two time-spans, and your initial probability has 260 factors of ten in it.\n \n I also still question that initial probability. Can you show (my initial challenge, I believe), that the many other combinations of amino acids would not have formed life? More fatally, Sidney Fox's experiments on microspheres shows that peptides ('proteinoids', smaller protein chains) form spontaneously from amino acids - and from these, small proto-cells.\n \n You've been assuming that amino acids just all come together and form a massive chain.

This regulates the process much more severely - your 'grab-bag analogy is not relevant.\n \n \n[long technical stuff]\n\n I don't think this is worth responding to, unless you can show that you actually understand it, rather than just have gone google-trawling, found an article that looks relevant, copy-pasted it here and changed a few words to make it seem more relevant.\n \n \nDo you see what you're doing iangb?

And as for mars, the rovers found nothing and they bored down looking for it.\n\n No, I'm speculating on a problem - it's not a meant to the end of proving you wrong. \n The nearest star to the Sun is the Alpha Centuri system, which is 4 light-years away. If it had planets, we still couldn't see them with our most powerful telescopes.\n Life is not always 'obvious'. A desert looks void of life, until you look at it right.\n \n \nReally? Prove it!

The answer is we have no clue yet you speak so matter of factly as if this world is the standard by which other worlds should be judged. For scientific minds, you people don't do well thinking outside the box.\n\n ...you do know that initially we didn't breathe oxygen? It took photosynthesis to do it - before, we were more like this.\n \n The basic compounds that would structure life would be carbon- or silicone-based, as life is (by necessity) complex, and only those two atoms can bond in a wide enough variety of ways. Probably - other life-forms could exist, but would be fairly exotic.\n \n \nThis whole way of thinking is a conversation ender as far as I'm concerned.

Sheesh iangb, you have zero respect for the true intent of the scientific method which explains why you believe this trash.\n\n You challenged us to show you how life could have formed from non-life. I've done so. Personally, I'd love to know more - but you can no longer simply state that 'there is no way live could have come from non-life', because we have shown you a method by which it could have. That was my purpose, not an accurate historical documentation - because, as I said, we simply don't know yet.\n \n There are still lots of questions, and I look forwards to finding the answers. But the question you asked has been dealt with, and you are now trying to change the nature of that question.\n \n \nThe numbers are fictional, but based in fact? Do you think about what you write before you write it? Answer me this iangb, what if none of those compounds were present in a prebiotic earth? Prove for me they were present!

Science is all 'if it sounds reasonable, take the ball and see how far you can take it'. If something has evidence that it is true, and has not been proven false, then why discard it? Nothing 'scientific' can be know 'for certain' - solipsism proves that one.\n \n By 'numbers are fictional, but based in fact', I mean exactly that. I could say I spent ten pounds when I went shopping, whereas in fact I spent \u00a39.79 - the 'ten pounds' figure is fictional, but based on the truth - and reasonably accurate for the purposes of my statement.\n \n \nI would build a time machine. Beside that, there is no way of knowing anything that happened this alleged 4+ billion years ago. After all, I know that God spoke creation into being, so I would go back just to see what existed then.\n\n In other words, no. Given that you have no viable alternatives, on what basis do you dismiss valid information about possible methods of abiogenesis?\n \n \nAgain, prove it was a valid model of condition in our prebiotic world, and prove that not being precise woudn't have any effect on the outcome? I can't even believe you would dare say such a thing as you claim to respect scientific methodology.\n\n The composition of the early world is fairly predictable - this is why the recent excitement about 'volcano-like' conditions. Simple chemistry proves that it would not have effected the outcome - there is no way another reactant could have disrupted the experiment short of irradiating it or being highly reactive - in which case, the reactant would have been removed in the process and it would have worked the next time around.\n \n \n EDIT: A final death blow to Archie's argument.

   "Sheesh; you leave the room for a few minutes and everything goes to hell...\n \nThis might be true on a purely technical level. But as a rational and a realistic rule, when the total number of possible combinations is 20 times 20 times 20 repeated 200 times. The result is a one with 260 zeros after it, or 10 to the power of 260 or a billion billion billion repeated 29 times. and that's only for a short protein only 200 amino acids long, that mathematical probability factor pretty much means that the chance of complex life coming about by way of random mutation through this process is infinitely improbable. And that my friend, is an undeniable mathematical fact once you extend these probabilities to even the simplest complex organism like a small fish which has a brain the size of a pea.\n\n For a specific 200-acid protein to form, completely by chance, the odds are indeed as you describe. So far, so good. Here's where things get trickier for you: can you show that the emergence of first life is in any way dependent upon that event occurring?\n \n The answer is no. There's no evidence or reason to suppose first life required even one protein 200 amino acids long, let alone one specific such protein or the thousands or millions of interrelated proteins we see around us today. First life was not a fish. Fish didn't arrive on the scene for another 3,300,000,000 years. So the 1 in 10^260 figure, or the larger ones implied by extending the notion of spontaneous emergence to complex forms of life, simply aren't relevant in the context of abiogenesis.\n \n Nor is it relevant in terms of evolution, because asking whether a specific 200-acid protein can evolve is not at all the same as asking whether it can form in one step purely by chance. There may be 10^260 permutations of amino acids in a 200 acid chain, but from any given 200-acid protein there are only around 4000 one-step substitution mutations. So 'finding' that 200 acid protein only required a few thousand mutations to the one that preceded it, which in turn only required a few thousand mutations to find from the one preceding that, and so on. You could rewrite the whole protein that way in just a few thousand generations. So the relevant question is not 'How improbable is it that a specific 200 acid protein occurred by chance?' but 'How improbable is it that a protein with an evolutionary route to that 200-acid protein could occur?'\n \n Dawkins calls this issue 'Climbing Mt Improbable'. It's very easy to jump up and down pointing at its many titanic, sheer faces - such as the one you present here: the spontaneous emergence of a specific 200-acid protein. It's something else entirely to prove that scaling that face is the only available route up :) Take the emergence of multicellular life, for example. It seems an impossible leap from single cell organisms to something as complex as - say - a fish. And of course it is impossible, which is why it didn't happen like that. But does it seem quite such an impossible leap from single cell life to something like a sponge - which is after all nothing more than an undifferentiated aggregate of cells? Not really. Mutations in yeast cells that promote clumping have been observed in the lab (the mutation helped prevent the cells being washed out of the nutrient solution). How about from there to a flatworm-like creature? Flatworms have a slightly more complex structure but they're still more a colony of independent cells than an organism in their own right: the reason they're flat is that each cell needs to absorb its own nutrients and oxygen, so there's only so far those cells can be from the surface of the creature and still survive. Once you actually start looking, Mt Improbable is riddled with passes and gentle slopes, and a great way to find them is to think about the following process:\n \n Individualism -< Cohabitation -< Cooperation -< Differentiation/Specialisation/Co-dependence.\n \n Whether it's proteins, genes, cells or societies of organisms, you can wind back the complexity-clock without falling off a sheer cliff of improbability by working back through that process. What came before highly differentiated, co-dependent clusters of cells like fish? Undifferentiated cooperatives of self-sufficient cells, like flatworms, or sponges. Before organisms existed with such things as hearts, blood was moved around the body by muscles that also served other purposes - and before blood, we're back to flatworms where each cell absorbs its own nutriment. Think about our current society, with all the specialised roles therin - it wasn't always like that. It emerged gradually from cooperatives of self-sufficient individuals, because cooperation is inherently more efficient than individualism, and specialisation inherently more efficient than self-sufficiency.",

Calling someone an &#8220;ignorant twit&#8221; or questioning their honesty is the worst possible way to go about convincing others of your point. The first step to convincing argumentation is to treat you opponent with respect.\n\n \n Hi skeptic, here is just a taste of the types of condescending and sanctimonious posts those who dare oppose these evolutionists must be subjected to on a regular basis here. So to be fair, rather than focus on us as the problem, you might want to advise the evolutionists to show some respect in debating these issues and you would find that I can be a nice guy also. Notice the number of them who will outnumber us 3 or 4 to 1, yet they use that advantage to mock and insult rather than debate facts and discuss the possibilities.I challenge you to go back and read a thread from the beginning and see who starts with the insults as they use that tact to marginalize both the evidence and the opinions of those they oppose. \n \n \nAnd just because you pretend you know what you're talking about doesn't mean you do.\n \n You are the one making a claim. You are the one who has to support it. And saying \"you're wrong\" does not count as supporting your assertion.\n\n \n \nI think you need a whack upside the head, your record appears to be stuck in a groove.\n \n Pandion and Peeling have both pointed out to you that this article is incorrect, and that the claims it is wrong about are common knowledge. Repeating it does not help your case.\n \n Which fossil coelacanth is the modern variety \"unchanged\" from? Here's a couple examples of fossile coelacanths:\n Pharyngula::Coelacanth evolution\n \n Here's a post listing more differences:\n Living fossils\n \n To continue to insist you're right by repeating an article who's errors have already been pointed out to you is...\n Woops, forgot who I was talking to there.\n\n \n \nAll you and your apologist sources prove is that you are very good at back pedaling and changing your stories once you've been caught red handed making huge unsupported assumptions and faulty and imaginary conclusions which fit with your preconceived notions. \n \n What is undeniable is that until a living Coelacanth had been found, you all claimed it was a long extinct transitional fossil between fish and amphibian. Here's the lowdown from yet another source.\n One example that amply demonstrates the accuracy of evolutionary dating and sequencing of fossil fish, or any fossil for that matter, would be the story of the coelacanth. This is a genuine fish story. For many years evolutionists had assured us that the coelacanth, a member of the crossopterygian family and a supposed link to amphibians, had most definitely been extinct for at least sixty million years, at least according to their precise methods of dating and their exact analysis of the indisputable evidence of the fossil record. No doubt about it, the coelacanth died out millennia ago along with the dinosaurs, at least until a living coelacanth was dredged up off the coast of Africa in 1938.\n \n Since then hundreds of live coelacanths have been found. In the June, 1988 National Geographic Magazine they featured numerous pictures of the coelacanth swimming around in the ocean depths, where they differ very little from the ones found entombed in the fossil layers, thus providing no evidence of any kind of evolution occurring for the coelacanth, despite the fact that the evolutionists say these fish have been swimming around for at least four hundred million years.\n \n The ancient coelacanths, from the first time they appeared in the fossil record were virtually identical to the living ones we find at the present day, extending all the way back through the geologic record past the Paleogene age of the mammals (63 million years), before the Cretaceous and Jurassic age of the dinosaurs (100 million through 225 million years ago), before the Triassic age of early mammals (200 million through 250 million years ago), before the Permian age of early reptiles (250 million through 300 million years ago), before the Carboniferous age (300 million through 370 million years ago), all the way back to the Devonian era, 400 million years ago in the fossil record, according to the time scale of the evolutionists.\n \n Initially it couldn't be admitted that a living coelacanth had appeared that was identical to a species that evolutionists had calmly assured us was extinct for so many millions of years.\n \n Thus when a live example of this extinct fish had been found, J.L.B. Smith, a chemist and ichthyologist at Rhodes University in Grahamstown University, South Africa, pronounced it an entirely new genus and species, differentfrom any coelacanth previously recorded as fossils. Smith gave the living coelacanth a very scientific name, Latimeria chalumnae, after Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer who discovered the fish, and the mouth of the Chalumna River where it was captured.\n \n Just how different is this fish from the ancient coelacanth? On pp.832 of the National Geographic article of 1988, there is a study of the comparative anatomy between the living and ancient coelacanth with this caption next to pictures of each one. They state: \"LIKE CARBON COPIES, the tail of a live coelacanth and a 140-million year-old fossil virtually match.\" \n They go on to report: \"Few creatures have endured such an immense span of time with so little change as the coelacanth. The cut-away drawing of a present-day specimen seems almost identical with the 140-million year-old fossil found in a quarry in southern West Germany. It is that extraordinary lack of change that enabled Professor J.L.B. Smith in Grahamstown to identify the coelacanth caught in South Africa in 1938 from a rough sketch, although he had never seen a live specimen.\"(30)The Fossil Record\n \n I repeat for punctuation that before the fix was in, how even the National Geographic told the truth about the fossil and the living example of the fossil. \n Just how different is this fish from the ancient coelacanth? On pp.832 of the National Geographic article of 1988, there is a study of the comparative anatomy between the living and ancient coelacanth with this caption next to pictures of each one. They state: \"LIKE CARBON COPIES, the tail of a live coelacanth and a 140-million year-old fossil virtually match.\" \n They go on to report: \"Few creatures have endured such an immense span of time with so little change as the coelacanth.

Smith in Grahamstown to identify the coelacanth caught in South Africa in 1938 from a rough sketch, although he had never seen a live specimen.\"(30)\n\n \n \nWho the hell's backpedaling? No one. What everyone is doing is pointing out that, once again, you're wrong.\n \n \n Guess what numbskull? The coelacanth is a long extinct fossil. However, we happened to find that one species is still around. \n \n \n Oh can it! The only one being dishonest is you. When are you going to tell me which one of those pics from my last post the modern fish is exactly like?\n \n Once again Archie proves how little he knows, and has to make sure we all see how wrong he can possibly be.\n\n \n \nIs arch actually arguing that the coelacanth in the fossils is the same coelacanth that swims around the ocean today? \n \n Does anyone think he knows that there are two distinct species that different in several anatomical ways from the coelacanth in the fossil?\n\n \n \nYep\n \n \n LMAO\n \n Does Archie ever know what he's talking about?\n\n \n \nOutside of scripture, no. He's currently trying to ignore the economics in a discussion we're having about central planning. GDP does not appear anywhere in his writing.\n\n \n \nYou all refuse to accept the reality of what evolution originally claimed prior to a living fish being found to still exist. And did you notice that not one of your cowardly buddies posted one bit of evidence to refute my evidence, but just personally attacked me? The only thing you guys can do in insult the intelligence of those who don't accept your gospel of evolution and your secular humanist drivel. \n \n The fact is that my evidence directly refutes your evidence, from Dawkins to Talk Origins. You said that your link distinguished the size of 15 inches to 4.5 feet, and TO said nothing of the sort. It just referred to different size. What if the fossil was a juvenile as compared to a mature adult in the living example? So your claim proves nothing by focussing only on size. And it can't be denied that evos made claims prior to living examples being found that proved evos claims regarding this so called transitional fossil were totally and completely erroneous. \n \n This is evidence that you guys are real good at taking a fossil, making up a great cover story which places it and categorizes it in the fossil record on the so called evolutionary tree. This fish was referred to as solid evidence of a transitional fish from the devonian period. But that's a fact you all don't want to face. You are expert at ignoring the mistakes, false assertions and dead ends which evolution is rife with. And as is usual, most of you resort to ignorant denials and personal attacks when faced with evidence of evos erroneous assumptions. So, in the final analysis, it remains to be seen which of us is steeped in ignorance for believing in fairy tales, and I submit it is your side which is in for a shock.\n \n And baconsbud, these are all my words. If you have a problem with me posting supporting links then you need to understand the concept of giving supporting evidence. Something you are obviously unaware of on debate forums to prove a point being made. For example, your post added nothing positive at all to this debate. But welcome to the forum, you'll find plenty of like minded people like yourself who are all clueless to the realities of who we are as human beings and how we got here.\n",
