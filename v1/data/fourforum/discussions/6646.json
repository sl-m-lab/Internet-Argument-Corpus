From here.\n \n\n Domestic violence groups, like the Family Violence Coalition, have collected anecdotal evidence that pregnant women are at twice the risk of battery by their male partners compared to women who are not pregnant. These groups report that 40% of assaults against women by their male partners begin during their first pregnancy. Additionally, diagnostic guidelines on domestic violence released by the American Medical Association in 1992 showed that 23% of the women seeking prenatal care were victims of domestic violence\n\n \n They also instituted what I was suggesting:\nIn 1999, the Connecticut General Assembly passed PA 99-186, which subjects anyone who assaults a pregnant woman to the same enhanced criminal penalty as those who assault people who are age 60 or older, blind, or disabled\n\n \n \n\n I thought bringing the fetus into it only \"muddied\" the picture?\n\n \n If the fetus is considered on its own terms, yes.

   "emoticon_xangel I study fallacies and am not presenting an opinion on the matter but here is a very interesting exapmle presented by Mary Anne Warren, in her analysis of a familiar anti-abortion argument: \n 1) It is wrong to kill innocent human beings \n 2) Fetuses are innocent human beings \n Therefore, it is wrong to kill fetuses. \n Warren argues that, in fact, this argument faces its own dilemma: either it is guilty of equivocation - or it is guilty of question-begging. \n It is easy enough to argue that \"innocent human beings\" means two different things in the premises - and thus the argument equivocates. For example: \n innocent human being in premise 1 = \"conscious of moral choice, but not guilty of committing/choosing an immoral act\" \n innocent human being in premise 2 = \"innocent because the fetus is not capable of moral intentions and choices in the first place\" \n IF two different senses of \"innocent human being\" are thus at work in the argument - then the argument equivocates: while we might agree that it is wrong to kill innocent human beings in the first sense - this is not immediately relevant to fetuses as innocent human beings in the second sense, and so the conclusion does not follow. \n [Alternatively, if we are not equivocating - if we somehow mean \"innocent human beings\" in the exact same sense in both premises - then the argument begs the question. That is, the premises taken together would then mean: \n it is wrong to kill innocent human beings, where \"innocent human beings\" includes fetuses. \n BUT: this is precisely the conclusion we're seeking to establish (or, the question under discussion). Our argument in this version then amounts to \n [P] it is wrong to kill innocent human beings, where \"innocent human beings\" includes fetuses \n [C] therefore it is wrong to kill fetuses [as innocent human beings] \n The argument thus goes in a circle, as the premises already include everything we're attempting to assert in the conclusion - alternatively, the premises offer no additional argument, evidence, or information in support of the conclusion. Rather, the premises merely restate the conclusion, and the conclusion merely restates the premises. Or: the question, \"Is it wrong to kill fetuses?\" is begged as the answer to the question is merely assumed in the premises.",

   "1) It is wrong to kill innocent human beings \n 2) Fetuses are innocent human beings \n Therefore, it is wrong to kill fetuses. \n \nNobody can argue that fetuses purposely do any harm. However, to be guilty or innocent requires, as an absolute minimum, that the entity in question has a mind, in other words, a mental existence. A rock or a house cannot be innocent or guilty, neither can several cells moments after conception, which will eventually become a person but not for many months yet. My contention has always been that a fetus doesn't become a person until it has a rudimentary mind - which is on or after roughly the 30th week of pregnancy. After that, one can refer to it as an \"innocent human being\".",
