Can government regulate ammunition more stringently than they may firearms?\n B. Can government implement taxes on individual items in a set unit of measure for sale?\n C.

   "Are you saying that people have a right to benefit from having a police force, a military, a fire department, a court system, public schools, etc. but pay nothing for it?\n\n Of course not. No one has a right to the cooperation of a single person much less a society.\n \n However by the same principle no one has a right to anyone else's cooperation just because they are trying to do something collectively.\n \n If you want a benefit but cannot engineer it such that only those who support it may receive it then your choice is to do it anyway... or not do it; you do not have the right to force people to support it just because it would help them.\n \n If a musician wants to play in a plaza he cannot demand payment just because everyone there hears his beautiful music, they must agree to pay before he starts playing if he wants that, hence auditoriums.\n \n If a man walks up to your car and starts cleaning it without you asking for it, he does not have a right to the payment he then demands because he never had your agreement on a trade.\n \n If a neighbor decides to clean up the neighborhood he is benefiting everyone in it, yet let him try to take his neighbors to court for not paying him for it when he never acquired their promise to do so.\n \n This principle is called liberty, cooperation occurs when and only when both parties agree to it. We use it with each other and with companies. What perverse excuse could be generated for a government when it is completly obvious that divine right and all such similar appeals to some extra human authority are fallacious? (i.e. that the government may only derive it's rights from the people.)\n \n I acknowledge the possibility of a social function which is weighed down by 'freeloaders' and which is for the most part necessary.\n \n I am willing to pay for it anyway, to pay for the freeloaders because if it is truly necessary than it is a good trade regardless. It may urk your sense of fairness but be objective, the benefit of society is great.\n \n \nWhich brings up the question- How is a police force, a military, a fire department, a court system, public schools, etc. going to be paid for without taxation?\n\n Money from people who have agreed to support them. Those particular examples (besides public schools) are what I would like to point out as completly abstract benefits. i.e. the benefit is not really targeted to any person in particular so freeloaders are unlikely to get specific benefits. For instance I would not want my police force to avoid arresting any criminal just because he lives in a poor neighborhood which isn't paying much, a criminal is a danger to everyone. A military operates on the same premise, they can't just defend freeloaders they defend huge tracts of land and so you can't really point to an instance and say 'this isn't helping those who paid for it'. A fire is a very clear example of a public hazard, I don't care if Bambi started it, put it out please, that's what I would pay them for not specifically saving somebodies house.",
