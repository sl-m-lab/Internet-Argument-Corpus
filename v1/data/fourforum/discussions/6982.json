   "Public health scares themselves are becoming a \"risk factor\" in producing more anxiety - sometimes with physical symptoms both real and imaginary. This phenomenon used to be confined only to those fearful hypochondriacs who read Medical Dictionaries from A to Z for pleasure. No doubt the government will soon be giving advice about the dangers of paying attention to daily reports of new threats to being alive. \n \n Warning fatigue is an adverse side effect of listening to the surfeit of health scares. Eventually, this leads to ignoring messages about genuine health hazards.",

   "I've read some interesting articles about this recently, which suggested that the problem was largely due to the way in which the media reports science, that journalists are rarely scientifically trained and so don't really understand what they're reporting. This is partly how the MMR thing got out of hand.",
