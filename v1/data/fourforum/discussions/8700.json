   "The latest and most bitterly contested battle in the culture war is the controversy over Darwin and Intelligent Design. And yet much of what you've heard on these subjects is wrong.\n \n In The Politically Incorrect Guide to Darwinism and Intelligent Design (which you can get for free), Jonathan Wells, Ph.D., reveals that today's Darwinists are unable to fend off growing challenges from scientists or to compete with rival theories better adapted to the latest evidence. \n \n Darwinism, like Marxism and Freudianism \n before it, is simply unfit to survive.\n \n Dr. Wells, a biologist and senior fellow at the respected Discovery Institute, begins by explaining the basic tenets of Darwinism, and the evidence both for and against it. He reveals, for instance, that the fossil record, which according to Darwin should be teeming with \"transitional\" fossils showing the development of one species to the next, so far hasn't produced a single incontestable example. \n \n On the other hand, certain well-documented aspects of the fossil record -- such as the \"Cambrian Explosion,\" in which innumerable new species suddenly appeared fully formed -- directly contradict Darwin's theory. Wells also shows how most of the other \"evidence\" for evolution -- including textbook \"icons\" such as Peppered Moths, Darwin's Finches, Haeckel's Embryos, and the Tree of Life -- has been exaggerated, distorted . . . or even faked.\n \n Intelligent Design -- it's not what you think\n \n Wells then turns to the theory of Intelligent Design, (ID) the idea that some features of the natural world, such as the internal machinery of cells, are too \"irreducibly complex\" to have resulted from unguided natural processes alone.\n \n In clear-cut layman's language, he reveals the growing evidence in support of ID that is coming out of scientific specialties from microbiology to astrophysics. And he explains why, since ID is not based on the Bible or religious doctrines, and doesn't draw any conclusions about who (or what) is the cause of design in nature, it is not a form of Biblical creationism or natural theology.\n \n But religion does play a role in the debate over Darwin -- though not the way evolutionists claim. Wells (who holds doctorates in biology and theology) shows how Darwin reasoned that evolution is true because divine Creation \"must\" be false -- a theological assumption oddly out of place in a scientific debate. In other words, Darwinists' materialistic, atheistic assumptions rule out any theories but their own, and account for their willingness to explain away the evidence -- or lack of it.\n \n This hostility to religion may also explain the appeal of Darwinism, which from Darwin's day down to our own has been used to justify radical changes in moral norms in areas such as eugenics, abortion, and -- in the case of Nazi Germany -- even racial extermination. \n \n Finally, Wells details how Darwinists have succeeded in imposing a government-supported monopoly on the biological sciences in this country -- and how opponents of Darwinism are being driven from their careers by Darwinist heresy-hunters.\n \n The collapsing case for Darwinism\n and the mounting case for Intelligent Design\n \n How, though Darwin is often credited with citing \"overwhelming evidence\" for his theory of natural selection, all he actually provided was \"one or two imaginary illustrations\" of how the process might work \n \n How, despite centuries of artificial breeding and decades of experiments, no one has ever observed one species turn into another (\"speciation\") \n \n Darwin vs. Darwin: how he conceded that his theory was contradicted by known evidence (or lack thereof), though he hoped later findings would vindicate him -- which still hasn't happened after 150 years \n \n How Darwin's \"strongest single class of facts\" -- the early vertebrate embryos -- shows the opposite of what he thought it showed \n \n The Cambrian Explosion -- a/k/a biology's \"Big Bang\": How it contradicts Darwin's branching \"Tree of Life\" \n \n Word games Darwinists play (example: exploiting the diverse meanings of \"evolution\" to distract critics) \n \n How science textbooks continue to feature \"evidence\" for Darwinism that has long since been proven fraudulent \n \n Why the clinical practice of medicine has no use for Darwinism, despite claims that it is impossible to practice medicine without applying its principles \n \n Says an evolutionary biologist: \"Perhaps it would be easier, and in the long run more productive, to abandon the attempt to force the data . . . into the mold provided by Darwin\" \n \n A modern microbiologist adds: \"Throughout 150 years of the science of bacteriology, there is no evidence that one species of bacteria has changed into another\" \n \n How the most common definition of Intelligent Design in the news media is completely incorrect \n \n How design can be inferred not only from living things but also from various features of the cosmos, such as gravity \n \n How Darwinism is widely used in public education to discredit traditional Christianity and promote atheism \n \n NewsMax.com",

   "Dr. Wells, a biologist and senior fellow at the respected Discovery Institute,\n\n Man, these guys can't even get into the science before they're outright lying...\n \n \nthe fossil record, which according to Darwin should be teeming with \"transitional\" fossils showing the development of one species to the next, so far hasn't produced a single incontestable example.\n\n I can \"contest\" that the earth goes around the sun. The point is that fossils like Archaeopteryx are so clearly intermediate that creationists repeatedly change their minds on whether it's a reptile \"kind\" or a bird \"kind.\"\n I have also not seen a creationist response to Tiktaalik besides the mind-numbingly stupid claims of \"We don't know if it's really an intermediate\" and \"it's not an intermediate, it's just an organism with a mixture of characteristics of species that came before and after it!\" (No, really, I'm not making this up.)\n \n \nOn the other hand, certain well-documented aspects of the fossil record -- such as the \"Cambrian Explosion,\" in which innumerable new species suddenly appeared fully formed -- directly contradict Darwin's theory.\n\n No, they don't.\n \n \nWells also shows how most of the other \"evidence\" for evolution -- including textbook \"icons\" such as Peppered Moths, Darwin's Finches, Haeckel's Embryos, and the Tree of Life -- has been exaggerated, distorted . . . or even faked.\n\n Yes yes, this was all covered in Wells' previous book, Icons of Evolution. It has been refuted numerous times (some even on this forum). See here for a thorough debunking.\n \n \nIntelligent Design -- it's not what you think\n\n It may not be what I think (after all, so-called \"intelligent\" designs really aren't very intelligent), but it's exactly what I think it is: total garbage based upon religion shrouded in wannabe science.\n \n \nWells (who holds doctorates in biology and theology) shows how Darwin reasoned that evolution is true because divine Creation \"must\" be false -- a theological assumption oddly out of place in a scientific debate.\n\n Whether Darwin did or didn't reason this (and he didn't) is irrelevant; the fact remains that the evidence supports evolution.\n \n \nIn other words, Darwinists' materialistic, atheistic assumptions rule out any theories but their own\n\n I love it when the ID proponents think that theistic evolutionists (like Catholics) are atheists. Apparently, one can be both a theist and an atheist.\n \n \nDarwinism, which from Darwin's day down to our own has been used to justify radical changes in moral norms in areas such as eugenics, abortion, and -- in the case of Nazi Germany -- even racial extermination.\n\n If I argue that all babies should be killed, and you don't think all babies should be killed, does that mean that all babies aren't really babies? No, it means that you think my reasoning is unjustified. Think about that for a second, then re-read the claim.\n \n \nFinally, Wells details how Darwinists have succeeded in imposing a government-supported monopoly on the biological sciences in this country -- and how opponents of Darwinism are being driven from their careers by Darwinist heresy-hunters.\n\n So says Wells, who received a Ph.D. in biology despite being a fundy creationist, and is now a fellow at the Disco Institute. Can you believe what this guy is trying to get away with?\n \n \nHow, though Darwin is often credited with citing \"overwhelming evidence\" for his theory of natural selection, all he actually provided was \"one or two imaginary illustrations\" of how the process might work\n\n Pretty good considering Darwin wasn't aware of genetics. Too bad Wells is stuck in 1859. The modern synthesis provides perfectly legitimate mechanisms.\n \n \nHow, despite centuries of artificial breeding and decades of experiments, no one has ever observed one species turn into another (\"speciation\")\n\n Out-and-out lie. There's really no other way to put this.\n \n \nDarwin vs. Darwin: how he conceded that his theory was contradicted by known evidence (or lack thereof), though he hoped later findings would vindicate him -- which still hasn't happened after 150 years\n\n More lies. I mentioned genetics and observed instances of speciation, yes?\n \n \nHow Darwin's \"strongest single class of facts\" -- the early vertebrate embryos -- shows the opposite of what he thought it showed\n\n Even if this vague claim were true, would it weaken evolutionary theory? No.\n \n \nThe Cambrian Explosion -- a/k/a biology's \"Big Bang\": How it contradicts Darwin's branching \"Tree of Life\" \n\n Already covered in Icons of Obfuscation.\n \n \nWord games Darwinists play (example: exploiting the diverse meanings of \"evolution\" to distract critics)\n\n Distract? No. If Wells is accusing equivocation, he'd better be able to back up his claim.\n \n \nHow science textbooks continue to feature \"evidence\" for Darwinism that has long since been proven fraudulent \n\n Another personal favorite of mine... When I showed up to a seminar hosted by a local creationist, I challenged him to produce a textbook with false evidence. He couldn't. When I brought every last biology and biochemistry textbook from my college career to him for him to scour, he didn't even bother to look.\n Translation: this claim is XXXX, and Wells knows it.\n \n \nWhy the clinical practice of medicine has no use for Darwinism, despite claims that it is impossible to practice medicine without applying its principles\n\n Tell that to CDC pathologists. Or just read this post.\n ETA: Alternatively, let's look at the logic in this way: because the field of quantum mechanics is useless for helping me describe classical physical systems, quantum mechanics must be wrong. I think this illustrates the fallacy satisfactorily.\n \n \nSays an evolutionary biologist: \"Perhaps it would be easier, and in the long run more productive, to abandon the attempt to force the data . . . into the mold provided by Darwin\"\n\n Uncited, unreferenced, altered, and out of context quotes are generally ignored.\n \n \nA modern microbiologist adds: \"Throughout 150 years of the science of bacteriology, there is no evidence that one species of bacteria has changed into another\"\n\n What did I just get through saying?\n \n \nHow the most common definition of Intelligent Design in the news media is completely incorrect\n\n It's quite obvious that it's the ID proponents who have issues with definitions, particularly among themselves. Behe has changed his own definition of IC, and Dembski changed Behe's definition of IC. \n \n \nHow design can be inferred not only from living things but also from various features of the cosmos, such as gravity \n\n Show me. I dare you.",
