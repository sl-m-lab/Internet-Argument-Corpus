   "In spite of all assurances of US officials about impossibility of military operation against Iran American strategists are continuing with war preparations.\n Iraq, Afghanistan, Georgia and Turkey - those countries became participants of anti Iran campaign in absentia. And now Americans are embracing East Europe in their war plans. \n It is by US request that Bulgarian nuclear power plant Kozloduy will be closed. No doubts that Pentagon plans to use air bases at Bulgaria territory for military operations against Iran! Washington strategists understand that Bulgaria territory will be object of Islam terrorists attack or target for reciprocal missile Iran attack. That's why Americans lobby our NPP closing for if attacked it can lead to really terrifying catastrophe! So far collaboration with USA have brought only discouraging revelations and has created more challenges to our safety. Do we really need it so much?",
