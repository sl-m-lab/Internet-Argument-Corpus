   "Jews say God does not have a \"Son\" as Christians understand it.\n \n The Text of Scroll 4Q246 - the Son of God Scroll:\n \n \"He shall be called the son of God, and they shall designate [call] him son of the Most High. Like the appearance of comets, so shall be their kingdom. \n For brief years they shall reign over the earth and shall trample on all; \n one people shall trample on another and one province on another until the people of God shall rise and all shall rest from the sword.\"\n \n Compare the words in the scroll 4Q246 text to the inspired words found in Luke 1:32 and 35: \"He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David... And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God\" (Luke 1:32-35).\n \n Anyone comparing these two first century texts will be startled by the amazing similarity of concept and wording describing the Messianic leader. One of the great differences between Christian and Jewish conceptions of the promised Messiah revolves around His relationship to God. While the Jews believe the Messiah will be a great man, such as Moses, with a Divine mission, the Christians believe that the Bible teaches that the Messiah would be uniquely \"the Son of God.\" The Jewish view usually held that the concept of a \"son of God\" violated the primary truth of monotheism found in Deuteronomy 6:4 \"Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord.\" The Christians believed that Jesus' claim to be the Son of God was not a violation of Deuteronomy 6:4. Rather, Christians believe in the Trinity, the doctrine that the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit are revealed in the Bible to be One God, revealed in three personalities. As Christians, we do not believe in three separate gods. Therefore, Christians understand the statements about Jesus as the Son of God to be in complete conformity to the truth of monotheism - there is only one God. It is fascinating in this regard to consider the presence of these statements in this first century Jewish text: \"He shall be called the son of God, and they shall designate [call] him son of the Most High.\" \n \n The presence of these statements in the Dead Sea Scrolls suggests that some of the Essenes either accepted the Messianic claims of Jesus to be the Son of God or anticipated this concept. Either possibility opens up new areas for exploration. Another possibility that must be considered is this: Is it possible that this scroll 4Q246 is a direct quote from the writer hearing the words of the Gospel of Luke that was now widely circulating according to early Christian witnesses? Luke, the physician, claimed that he wrote the Gospel of Luke as an eyewitness of the events he personally observed. In Luke 1:1-3, he says: \"Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us, Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word; It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus.\" \n \n The discovery of the virtually identical wording \"the Son of God\" from Luke 1:32 and 35 with the scroll found buried in a cave in A.D. 68 stands as a tremendous witness to the early existence and transmission of the Gospel records within thirty-five years of Christ. \n \n Grant R.

Misquotes, mistranslations, and lies saying things are about Jesus is amazing.\n \n As for Jeffery Grant's nonsense, here is a different take on it. Remeber, the idiom (son of God) had a different meaning in Jewish culture (King David was called 'son of god' in psalm 2.)\n \n http://otstory.wordpress.com/2008/02/27/4q246-4qaramaic-apocalypse/\n \n \n Col.

The great God will be their help,\n \n 8. He Himself will fight for them, putting peoples into their power, all of them\n \n 9. He will cast them away before him, His dominion will be an everlasting dominion and all the abysses\n \n The main question of 4Q246 (Aramaic Apocalypse) is the personage designated the &#8220;Son of God.&#8221; Who is the &#8220;Son of God&#8221;? Is this a positive figure or a negative figure? J. T. Milik insists that the &#8220;Son of God&#8221; refers to a Seleucid king, referring Antiochus IV Epiphanes (Milik 1992, 383). Florentino Garcia Martinez suggests that it is an angelic savior as Michael, Melchizedek, and the Prince of Light (Martinez 1992, 162-79). Most scholars view the figure as a messianic redeemer who will overthrow God&#8217;s enemies and establish the kingdom of God&#8217;s people (Cross 1996, 1-13). But Joseph A. Fitzmyer argues that the reference of the Son of God is not a messiah, but a coming Jewish ruler, perhaps a member of the Hasmonean dynasty (Fitzmyer 1993, 173-74). According to the scholars, therefore, the title &#8220;Son of God&#8221; would be either a heavenly figue or a human being.\n \n Martin Hengel suggests that the figure is similar to &#8220;the one like a Son of Man&#8221; in Daniel 7:13-14 (Hengel 1976, 45), and argues that the tiles may be interpreted collectively &#8220;of the Jewish people.&#8221; I also argue that the author of 4Q246 was influenced by Daniel 7. The two texts reveal such an extensive degree of verbal, thematic, and structural correspondence. The most striking parallels between the two texts are the two phrases &#1513;&#1500;&#1496;&#1504;&#1492; &#1513;&#1500;&#1496;&#1503; &#1506;&#1500;&#1501; (&#8221;whose dominion is an everlasting dominion&#8221; [Dan 7:14; cf. 4Q246 2:9]) and &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514;&#1492; &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514; &#1506;&#1500;&#1501; (&#8221;his/its kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom&#8221; [Dan 7:27; cf. 4Q246 2:5]). Karl A. Kuhn argues that the verb &#1491;&#1493;&#1513; (crush) supplements these two verbal correspondences (Dan 7:23; 4Q246 2:3) in terms of the thematic parallels (Kuhn 2007, 28). In addition to these parallels, Kuhn suggests that the two texts present a transition of the dominion from the beasts/provinces to an individual figure/the people of God:\n \n 1. Following the prologue, both begin with a description of distress and destruction resolved by God&#8217;s intervention and the coming of God&#8217;s agent: in Daniel, the &#8220;one like a son of man,&#8221; and in 4Q246, the &#8220;Son of God, Son of the Most High&#8221; (Dan 7:4-14; cf. 4Q246 1:4-2:1ab).\n \n 2. The first account is followed by a second, again depicting the dominion of the evil beast(s)/peoples until the people of God arise and gain possession of the kingdom (Dan 7:15-22; cf. 4Q246 2:1c-7a).\n \n 3. Both texts conclude with still another rehearsal of the overthrow of the beast(s)/peoples who oppose God&#8217;s people (Dan 7:23-28; cf. 4Q246 2:7b-9).\n \n ",

Stop lying.\n \n Let's look at Psalm 2 with the commentary of Rambam\n \n \n 1. Why have nations gathered and [why do] kingdoms think vain things? &#1488;.\n Why have nations gathered: Our Sages (Ber. 7b) expounded the passage as referring to the King Messiah, but according to its apparent meaning, it is proper to interpret it as referring to David himself, as the matter is stated (II Sam. 5:17): &#8220;And the Philistines heard that they had anointed David as king over Israel, and all the Philistines went up to seek, etc.,&#8221; and they fell into his hands. Concerning them, he says, &#8220;Why have nations gathered,&#8221; and they all gathered. :\n and kingdoms think: vain things in their heart. :\n and kingdoms: Heb. &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;. Menachem interprets &#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, and &#1490;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; as all closely related. :\n 2. Kings of a land stand up, and nobles take counsel together against the Lord and against His anointed? &#1489;.\n Kings of a land stand up and nobles take counsel, etc.: Heb. &#1512;&#1493;&#1494;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, senors (seigneurs) in Old French, lords. :\n take counsel: Heb. &#1504;&#1493;&#1505;&#1491;&#1493;, an expression of counsel (&#1505;&#1493;&#1491;), furt konsilez in Old French (furent conseilles), they hold counsel (see below 55:15). And what is the counsel?&#8230; :\n 3. \"Let us break their bands and cast off their cords from us.\" &#1490;.\n Let us break their bands: Deronproms lor koyongles in Old French (as in Jer. 27:2). These are the bands with which the yoke is tied. :\n their cords: Heb. &#1506;&#1489;&#1514;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;, lor kordes (leur cordes) in Old French. :\n 4. He Who dwells in Heaven laughs; the Lord mocks them. &#1491;.\n laughs&#8230; mocks&#8230; speaks: They are meant as the present tense. :\n 5. Then He speaks to them in His wrath; and He frightens them with His sore displeasure. &#1492;.\n Then He speaks to them: Heb. &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;, like &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;. And what is the speech?&#8230; :\n 6. \"But I have enthroned My king on Zion, My holy mount.\" &#1493;.\n But I have enthroned My king: Why have you gathered together? I have appointed this one for Me to govern and to reign on Zion, My holy mount. :\n 7. I will tell of the decree; The Lord said to me, \"You are My son; this day have I begotten you. &#1494;.\n I will tell of the decree: Said David, &#8220;This is an established decree, and [one] that I have received to tell this and to make known.&#8221; :\n The Lord said to me: through Nathan, Gad, and Samuel. :\n You are My son: The head over Israel, who are called &#8220;My firstborn son.&#8221; And they will endure through you, as is stated concerning Abner (II Sam. 3:18): &#8220;for God said, etc., &#8216;By the hand of My bondsman David shall I deliver&#8230; Israel.&#8217;&#8221; And for their sake, you are before Me as a son because they are all dependent upon you. :\n this day have I: for I have enthroned you over them. :\n begotten you: to be called My son and to be beloved to Me as a son for their sake, as it is stated (II Sam. 7:14) concerning Solomon: &#8220;I will be to him a father, and he shall be to Me a son.&#8221; We find further concerning David (Ps. 89:27) &#8220;He shall call Me, &#8216;You are my Father, my God, and the Rock of my salvation.&#8217;&#8221; :\n 8. Request of Me, and I will make nations your inheritance, and the ends of the earth your possession. &#1495;.\n Request of Me: Pray to Me whenever you come to battle your enemies. :\n 9. You shall break them with an iron rod; like a potter's vessel you shall shatter them.\" &#1496;.\n You shall break them: Heb. &#1514;&#1512;&#1506;&#1501; [like] &#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1510;&#1510;&#1501;. :\n with an iron rod: That is the sword. :\n you shall shatter them: Heb. &#1514;&#1504;&#1508;&#1510;&#1501;, you shall break them, and that is the expression of &#1504;&#1508;&#1493;&#1509; throughout the Scriptures, a potsherd that is bro ken into fine pieces. :\n 10. And now, [you] kings, be wise; be admonished, [you] judges of the earth. &#1497;.\n And now, [you] kings, be wise: The Jewish prophets are merciful people. They reprove the heathens to turn away from their evil, for the Holy One, blessed be He, extends His hand to the wicked and to the righteous. :\n 11. Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with quaking. &#1497;&#1488;.\n and rejoice with quaking: When the quaking, about which it is written (Isa. 33:14): &#8220;Trembling seized the flatterers,&#8221; comes, you will rejoice and be happy if you have served the Lord. :\n 12. Arm yourselves with purity lest He become angry and you perish in the way, for in a moment His wrath will be kindled; the praises of all who take refuge in Him. &#1497;&#1489;.\n Arm yourselves with purity: Arm yourselves with purity of the heart. Some explain &#1504;&#1513;&#1511;&#1493; as garnimont in Old French, equipping. (This is from the verb, garnir. Garnimont means to provide, as in Gen. 41: 40). Menachem (p. 179) interprets it as an expression of desire, as (in Gen. 3:16): &#8220;Your longing (&#1514;&#1513;&#1493;&#1511;&#1514;&#1498;) shall be for your husband.&#8221; :\n lest He become angry: Heb. &#1497;&#1488;&#1504;&#1507;, lest He become angry. :\n and you perish in the way: Like the matter that is stated (above 1: 16): &#8220;but the way of the wicked shall perish.&#8221; :\n for in a moment His wrath will be kindled: For in a short moment His wrath will suddenly be kindled against them, and at that time, the praises of all those who take refuge in Him will be discerned, the praises of all who take refuge in Him.\n ",

   "In support of Easyrider:There are some Jewish people who call themselves Messianic Jews and believe in Yeshua, but seem to like the English transliteration of the Greek transliteration of Yeshua's name which is Jesus. They don't live like Jewish people. They celebrate Easter and Christmas, but forget about Passover. They ignore Shabbat and love their shrimp and barbeque ribs! We encourage Torah observance, including keeping Shabbat, eating Biblically kosher, and celebrating the Jewish holidays, as we simultaneously acknowledge Yeshua as the Jewish Messiah. We are called Messianic Jews by some people. Many people fail to admit that all of Yeshua's first followers were Jewish and that the New Testament was written by Jews who followed the customs and traditions of the Jewish people. If they were on earth today, they too, would be called Messianic Jews. We believe that if someone has been raised in a Jewish home and refers to himself as being Jewish, he should be aware that Yeshua is the Jewish Messiah. One reason that the Jewish mainline establishment discourages the reading of the New Testament is because they want to avoid questions being raised about Yeshua and his first followers that either they cannot or do not want to answer. We are not associated with Jews for Jesus nor are we associated with \"Friends of Israel,\" but we are friends of Israel! We also have no association with \"Chosen People Ministry\" but baruch hashem, we are part of the chosen people. We believe that Jewish people should live a lifestyle that is reflected by the belief system of the members of the UMJC (United Messianic Jewish Congregations) or MJAA (Messianic Jewish Congregations of America) organizations. Each Jewish home should be a beth shalom, a house of peace. If you were brought up in a Jewish home and have not yet asked the G-d of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob if Yeshua is the Messiah of Israel, we would love to venture out of our beth shalom to meet you for a cup of coffee and a bagel to answer your questions about why we believe he is our promised Messiah. \n \n \n Bottom Line\n \n The bottom line is, we want to bring you the light of Messiah, Yeshua. Light of Messiah? Yes, if you invite him into your life you will agree; light of Messiah! Perhaps you think Messianic Jews are not Jewish. Well, we wonder if you can really be Jewish and not believe in the Jewish Messiah! The Brit Chadasha (New Testament) was written mostly by Jewish men. All of Yeshua's the twelve disciples were Jewish. He is alive and will change your life and get rid of the darkness supernaturally. Want to know more? What if he really is the Jewish Messiah? Is there darkness in your life? You need the light of Messiah Yeshua! Maybe you have questions? So did every Jewish person who came to know the Jewish Messiah, Yeshua. Want to see some questions and answers? We have some online answers! Perhaps you have never read the Brit Chadasha New Testament and would like to read it. We recommend the \"Complete Jewish Bible\" by David Stern. A Jewish scholar living in Jerusalem. You don't have to be Messianic Jew to love a good Jewish book! Are you too skeptical to read the Brit Chadasha (New Testament)? Pray to the G-d of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Ask him to show you absolute truth. Open your Jewish Publication Society Bible or Art Scroll or any other Bible you that you have from your synagogue or bought from a Judaica store to Isaiah chapter 53. Then, read Proverbs Chapter 30 verse 4. Nu?Yeshua Connection is a Messianic Jewish portal. The Jewish choice for better understanding the Jewish Messiah Yeshua.",

It is because Jesus is the fulfillment of all of the OT prophecies regarding Gods final solution for redeeming humanity.\n Jesus said:Mat 5:17 \"Do not think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish but to fulfill.\n Mat 5:18 \"For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass from the Law until all is accomplished.\n So although Jesus fulfills the OT promises, not every prophecy concerning the completion of Gods plan has been accomplished yet. That is why the culmination of world history for this Age is defined by the second coming of Jesus Christ which will represent the completion of Gods plan and the onset of the next Age which is yet to come. \n \n \n Ding Ding Ding Why thats right Bob way back when in order to be a Christian all you had to do was be a follower of Christ. Well wouldn't that make MJ's just another branch of Christianity, well technically Archangel was right Jesus and the Apostles were all Jewish so it might be more accurate to say a part of MJ split off and became all the different Christians we have today.\n \n Just a different way of looking at the same thing\n\n \n Your point is actually interchangeable. Sure, you can say that Messianic Jews are just another branch or denomination of Christians, or one could say that all of Christianity is another branch of the original God intended version of Judaism which Jesus came and fulfilled with His life and subsequent death on the Cross. \n \n Only critical and cynical people get hung up on such trivial semantics though. God judges the heart and motivation of each person and knows who has truly accepted Him through the sacrifice Jesus made on the Cross for us. You see, the crimson chord which ties all believers to our Father in Heaven is His Holy Spirit which indwells everyone who accepts Jesus Christ as our personal Lord and Savior. In the end, that is all that counts to God, and that we honestly and sincerely represent His principles and serve Him with our lives.",

   "\"Crimson chord\"? Obviously a symbol stolen from the Invisible Pink Unicorn.\n\n \n Here's another one you can sweep under your rug:\n \n The Scarlet Cloth / Thread \n \n Quoted from JCNT:84, re: Mt 27.51: \n \n \"The parokhet in the Temple. Exodus 26:31-35 describes this curtain as it existed in the desert Tabernacle. It separated the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies. Only the cohen hagadol was allowed to pass through it into the Holy of Holies; and that he could do only once a year, on Yom-Kippur, to make an atonement sacrifice for his sins and for the sins of the Jewish people. When it was ripped in two from top to bottom it symbolized the fact that God was giving everyone access to the most holy place of all in heaven, as taught explicitly at MJ 9:3-9, 10:19-22 [that's \"Hebrews\" for goyim]. \n \n The Talmud bears an amazing witness to the work of Yeshua in altering the system of atonement. The background is that on Yom-Kippur, when the cohen hagadol sacrificed a bull (Leviticus 16), a piece of scarlet cloth was tied between its horns. If it later turned white, it meant that God had forgiven Israel's sin in accordance with Isaiah 1:18, \"Though your sins be as scarlet, they will be white as snow.\"\n \n \"Our Rabbis taught that throughout the forty years that Shim'on the Tzaddik served,... the scarlet cloth would become white. From then on it would sometimes become white and sometimes not.... Throughout the last forty years before the Temple was destroyed... the scarlet cloth never turned white.\" (Yoma 39a-39b) \n \n Thus in the days of Shim'on Tzaddik the sacrificial system established by God in the Tanakh was observed, and it was effective. But afterwards Israel's spirituality declined, so that the sacrificial system was effective only sometimes. Finally, after Yeshua's death, forty years before the destruction of the Temple, it was never effective. The Talmud does not say it, but what had become effective for forgiving Israel's sin was the sacrificial death of Yeshua the Messiah.\" \n \n http://www.christian-thinktank.com/dveil.html\n \n Jesus is Lord!",

   "Why Didn't The Red Ribbon on the Head of the Scapegoat Turn White in 30 C.E.?\n Question:\n \n I was wondering about a story that a \"Hebrew-Christian\" told me recently. He said that there was a scarlet cloth which would turn white every year when the high priest atoned for the sins of the people. When Jesus died, around 30 A.D., the cloth would no longer turn white when the priest atoned for sins because Jesus was the final atonement. I've read this story in other sources, and I wondered what you have to say about it.\n \n Answer:\n \n This assertion with which you were confronted has, in the last decade, attracted wide interest in the evangelical world. In fact, I am somewhat surprised that it has taken this long for one of our website visitors to write in with this question. \n \n In spite of the popularity this issue has gained in the Christian world in recent years, this contention stands out as one of the most bizarre arguments used by those who seek to convert the Jewish people to Christianity. What makes this line of reasoning so odd is that it seeks to use the Talmud to prove that Jesus is the messiah. While many readers of our website would simply be surprised to learn that missionaries would point to the Talmud to prove the validity of the Christian religion, in reality, this misuse of rabbinic literature is widespread. \n \n Those who have navigated through the plethora of Hebrew-Christian websites are well aware of how widespread this abuse of Jewish literature has become in recent years. Moreover, by probing this surprising missionary approach, we can gain enormous insight into the schizophrenic technique that Christendom so often takes in its cherished work of Jewish evangelism. \n \n Bear in mind, missionaries rarely shy away from an opportunity to condemn the Oral Law as the nimble work of men rather than the oral transmission handed down to us by Moses, our teacher. In fact, there are few issues that seem to produce the visceral passions of the Hebrew-Christian world as does the mere mention of the Talmud. These evangelicals fervently insist that the written Bible alone is reliable and divinely inspired and often scornfully mock traditional Jews as practicing a \"rabbinic Judaism.\" Needless to say, Christians rarely use this acrid label in a manor that is meant to be flattering. \n \n Paradoxically, whenever missionaries feel the urge to advance their position by quoting from the Talmud, they undergo a spontaneous conversion as they happily and unhesitatingly point to the works of the Talmud with a newfound regard for its truthfulness and inspiration. Yet the very same Talmud, which evangelicals gleefully use to advance their tenuous positions, also unambiguously states that Jesus of Nazareth was neither virtuous nor the messiah. This pick-and-choose approach that missionaries unflinchingly embrace doesn't appear to bother those dedicated to Jewish evangelism. \n \n Nevertheless, it is essential that we examine this well-worn argument with which you were confronted. In Tractate Yoma 39b, the Talmud quotes a Baraisa1 that discusses numerous remarkable phenomena that occurred in the Temple during the Yom Kippur service. More specifically, the Talmud states that there was a strip of scarlet-dyed wool tied to the head of the scapegoat2 which would turn white in the presence of the large crowd gathered at the Temple on the Day of Atonement. The Jewish people perceived this miraculous transformation as a heavenly sign that their sins were forgiven. The Talmud relates, however, that 40 years before the destruction of the second Temple the scarlet colored strip of wool did not turn white. The text of the Talmud which missionaries quote states,\n \n The Rabbis taught that forty years prior to the destruction of the Temple the lot did not come up in the [high priest's] right hand nor did the tongue of scarlet wool become white . . . .\n \n Citing the above statement, missionaries contend that the year the scarlet ribbon ceased to turn white coincides with the time that Jesus was crucified. They go on to insist that 40 years prior to the destruction of the second Temple corresponds to the year 30 C.E.,3 which is approximately the time of Jesus' crucifixion. They conclude, therefore, that the cessation of the whitening of the scarlet ribbon clearly indicates that God was no longer accepting animal sacrifices, and the Jewish people, therefore, needed to turn to Jesus as their only avenue for atonement. Ultimately, this argument asserts that reason the scarlet strip of wool did not turn white in the year 30 C.E. was due to the fact that the sins of the Jews were not forgiven because they did not accept Jesus as their messiah.\n \n As unimaginable as it would seem, particularly for those readers who are familiar with this well-known section of the Talmud, this argument has gained widespread attention over the last few years. In fact, the first time I heard this polemic used I watched in disbelief as a spellbound church audience turned pale when their pastor excitedly expounded on this quote from the Talmud in his sermon. It was a particularly disheartening spectacle to observe. Had any one of the parishioners in the audience gone to the local library and examined this entire section of the Talmud, they would have quickly realized that this quote had been misapplied and misused.\n \n Before we examine this statement in the Talmud, there are two issues which need to be raised here. The first point is that it is my hope that our website readers have noticed what those who advance this argument have done: They have attached an exegesis to the text of the Talmud that reflects a self-serving theology. In essence, missionaries are claiming that the reason why the strip of scarlet wool did not turn white must be attributed to the fact that the Jews rejected Jesus. This is a preposterous notion. In fact, if evangelicals wish to engage in this sophomoric approach, a far more congruous argument could be made here using their same line of reasoning. We can, utilizing the same course of logic, conclude that the reason the scarlet strip of wool did not turn white was due to the fact that masses of wayward Jews had followed the false messiah, Jesus of Nazareth. In other words, rather than attributing the reason for the scarlet strip of wool not turning white to the rejection of Jesus, it can be more steadily asserted that the reason this transformation didn't occur was due to the fact that many Jewish people had shamefully embraced Christianity. In fact, such an interpretation would be far more consistent with the whole of the Talmud.\n \n Bear in mind, I am not suggesting that this is the correct understanding of this text. It is not. We shall soon see that this section of the Talmud is unrelated to either of these explanations. I have made this point, however, to illustrate the self-serving nature of this circular missionary argument. \n \n The second point, however, presents a far more serious problem for Christian apologists. If in fact, as the \"Hebrew-Christian\" insisted, the reason that the scarlet wool strip did not turn white was \"because Jesus was the final atonement,\" and there was thus no longer any need for animal sacrifices, why then are the same animal sacrifices coming back? Christians have very little room to maneuver on this matter because the Bible is quite clear that the animal sacrificial system will be restored in the messianic age. In fact, in the last nine chapters of the Book of Ezekiel, the prophet describes in vivid detail the elaborate rituals and lofty ceremonies which will occur in the third and final messianic Temple. In chapters 43-44, Ezekiel clearly states that the animal sacrifices will be reinstated in their full glory. This simple fact should at least give Hebrew-Christians pause before they boldly proclaim that the transformation of the scarlet strip of wool had ceased due to the fact that God had done away with animal sacrifices. Clearly, God has not done away with them as evidenced by the fact that these elaborate Temple rituals will be restored with the advent of the messiah. \n \n Let us now examine the Talmudic discussion from which this quote was derived. As you will discover, this text was carefully quoted out of its original context. Once this crucial background is restored and understood, it will become clear that this quote does nothing to advance any Christian theology. \n \n Tractate Yoma4 is wholly given over to laws pertaining to Yom Kippur. Although missionaries cite the above statement which appears on page 39b, the discussion leading up to this quote begins on the previous page, 39a. Quoting from a Baraisa, the Talmud begins with a discussion of the deteriorating spiritual condition of the Jewish people during the second Temple period. Throughout this fascinating discourse, the miraculous events that transpired during the Temple ceremonies are the barometer by which the Baraisa measures the religious decline of the nation of Israel during this difficult epoch in Jewish history. The period of time examined in this assessment begins with the era during which Shimon HaTzaddik5 officiated as the high priest until the time that the Romans destroyed the second Temple in the year 70 C.E. More specifically, the Talmud breaks this period down into three successive stages, with the first stage being the most meritorious, the second marking a gradual spiritual decline, and the third the most deleterious.\n \n The Baraisa begins by recounting the miraculous events that repeatedly occurred during the forty years when Shimon HaTzaddik officiated as high priest. The Baraisa then continues to relate how the appearance of these miracles progressively diminished in the years that followed his death. These events are as follows:\n \n 1) The lot inscribed \"LaHashem,\" would always appear in the right hand of the high priest6 during the Yom Kippur service.\n \n 2) The strip of scarlet-dyed wool which was tied to the head of the scapegoat always turned white during the Yom Kippur service.\n \n 3) The western-most lamp of the Temple menorah remained lit until the priest would use its fire to kindle the next day's lamps.\n \n 4) The pyre on the altar did not require any additional wood to sustain a strong fire. \n \n 5) There was a blessing upon the first fruits of the Omer, the two loaves offered on Shevuoth, and on the loaves of the showbread so that each priest was satisfied with a portion no larger than the size of an olive.\n \n The faithfulness and goodwill that Shimon HaTzaddik embodied during his public tenure as high priest profoundly inspired the nation. His most famous maxim was, \"The world exists on three things: the Torah, divine worship, and acts of kindness.\" (Pirkay Avot 1:2) He is described as a person who took great thought and consideration regarding his fellow man.7 His extraordinary character affected the people deeply, and this manifested itself with a host of miraculous phenomena in the Temple, the House of Shimon's dedication. \n \n Following his death, however, the Jewish people were unable to sustain the spiritual heights which they had achieved during Shimon HaTzaddik's lifetime. As a result, they digressed into a downward spiritual spiral from which they never recovered. This decline continued and worsened as the second Temple era continued to unfold. The Baraisa therefore relates that after the death of Shimon HaTzaddik the occurrence of these miracles became sporadic; there were some years when these miraculous signs occurred, and there were other years when they did not. This spiritual decay plunged to its lowest point during the last 40 years of the second Temple period. The Baraisa records that none of the above miracles occurred during these last four decades of the second Temple. \n \n The question that immediately comes to mind is: In what dreadful sins did the children of Israel indulge during these last ill-famed 40 years of the second Temple that proved so devastating to their spiritual subsistence? What brought about the end of the miraculous events that were commonplace in the years that Shimon HaTzaddik served as high priest and periodically in the years that followed his death? \n \n With virtually no knowledge of the works of the Talmud, missionaries boldly insist that the scarlet ribbon not whitening relates to the crucifixion of Jesus. As you probably suspect by now, this contention is wholly without merit. Moreover, this Christian assertion entails a misuse of Jewish literature in order to advance a theology that is unknown to the Talmud. The Talmud, in fact, clearly and painfully records the sins that brought about the deplorable spiritual condition of the Jewish people during this last turbulent four decades of the second commonwealth. When quoting this Talmudic text, however, missionaries are careful to sidestep the crucial backdrop of this quote in the Talmud. By so doing, they deprive the uninitiated listener of indispensable knowledge and the vital tools to effectively respond to this argument.\n \n What makes the Christian use of this Talmudic quote so preposterous is the fact that the miracles in the Temple did not suddenly end in the year 30 C.E. as missionaries would have you think. On the contrary, the disappearance of miraculous phenomena began immediately following the death of Shimon HaTzaddik, which occurred many centuries before the destruction of the second Temple. In essence, there was not a sudden watershed event that caused supernatural events to end. The cessation of miraculous phenomena in the Temple was brought about by a slow spiritual decay among the Jewish people that lasted for many hundreds of years. \n \n Although there were a number of sins that were rampant among the nation of Israel throughout this spiritual decline, there was no iniquity that was as self-destructive as the interpersonal baseless hatred that was pervasive among the Jewish people during this difficult time. This dreadful self-inflicted wound had infected the Jewish people and ultimately brought about the destruction of the second Temple.8 The Talmud bears record to this spiritual decay, and declares that this national tragedy reached its height exactly 40 years prior to the destruction of the second Temple. It was during this turbulent time that murders became so widespread that the Sanhedrin9 ceased to judge capital crimes such as homicide.10\n \n Under normal conditions, the Sanhedrin rarely carried out capital punishment. In fact, the Talmud proclaims that a Sanhedrin which put more than one person to death in 70 years was unflatteringly regarded as a \"Killer Bais Din.\"11 The Jewish judicial system was not set up for a lawless society where murder among the nation of Israel was widespread. It is for this reason, and under these deplorable conditions, that the glory of the Temple was dimmed, the miracles in the sanctuary ceased, and the Sanhedrin withdrew itself from adjudicating capital punishment. \n \n Although the termination of miraculous events in the Temple was unrelated to Christian theology, it bore testimony to a time in history when Jewish people in great numbers turned against each other.\n \n I will add one final note in order to bring all of the above parts together. To illustrate this final point, however, I will raise a number of basic questions. Bear in mind, missionaries insist that God had discontinued the animal sacrificial system and replaced it with Jesus' sacrificial death on the cross. How can we know that the ending of the miraculous transformation of the scarlet ribbon was not connected to the ending of the animal sacrificial system, as missionaries contend? How can we be certain that the cessation of the whitening of the scarlet ribbon was entirely unrelated to the blood sacrificial system? Moreover, how can we be sure that the reason this miracle ended 40 years before the destruction of the second Temple was due to the deplorable lack of social justice and brotherly kindness among the Jewish people?\n \n Finally, what is the meaning behind this mysterious ritual of tying a scarlet ribbon to the head of the scapegoat with the hopeful anticipation that it would miraculously turn white? Why was the wool of the ribbon dyed scarlet? Why didn't they color it blue or green? Why would it turn white? Moreover, how could the nation know that the marvelous transformation from scarlet to white was a clear indication that their sins had been forgiven? In essence, how do the colors scarlet and white relate to social justice and brotherly kindliness? What is the connection?\n \n The answer to all these questions is found in the Bible. In the first chapter of the Book of Isaiah, the prophet severely castigates the Jewish people for their sins. However, Isaiah does not condemn his people for violating the Sabbath or not eating kosher. This was not the spiritual crisis which the nation was facing; rather, the prophet cries out that it was their lack of social justice and brotherly kindness that robbed the people of their spiritual sustenance. They had abandoned and turned on each other, especially the most vulnerable members of society -- the fatherless and the poor. With a visceral condemnation of his people that is virtually unparalleled in the Jewish scriptures, Isaiah berates the nation with the biting words. He compares his people to Sodom and Gomorrah and declares that if this is the manner with which you treat your fellow man, then God doesn't desire your Sabbaths and your New Moons are unwanted. \"When you beseech Me with your many prayers, I will not hear them for your hands are stained with blood.\"12 There was a time, Isaiah laments, that the city was filled with righteousness, but now it has become a harlot, filled with murderers!13\n \n It is painfully difficult to read this chapter. As we listen to the pounding words of the prophet, there is a mortifying and numbing sense that all hope is lost. Reconciliation is impossible; God will never take us back. It is, though, precisely at this most desperate juncture that Isaiah proclaims the unimaginable: Hope is not lost and God's tender mercy is within your grasp. What, though, should we do to possess this undeserved mercy? How can these seemingly unforgivable sins be forgiven? Does the prophet then announce that we must believe in a crucified messiah to gain our atonement? Is a blood sacrifice recommended as the answer to our desperate sinful predicament? Missionaries would have us think so, but Isaiah disagrees. The prophet, therefore, instructs,\n \n \"Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean; remove the evil of your doings from before my eyes; cease to do evil, learn to do good; seek justice, correct oppression; defend the fatherless, plead for the widow. Come now, let us reason together,\" says the Lord, \"though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool. If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land.\"14\n \n With the prophet's reassuring words before us, we can now understand why the miracle surrounding the transformation of the scarlet ribbon was uniquely connected to the atonement achieved through social justice and brotherly kindness rather than blood atonement. If your sins that are as the scarlet-colored ribbon are to be forgiven and become white, indulge in acts of kindness and put an end to murder and baseless hatred. These precious words fell on deaf ears during the last 40 years of the second Temple.\n \n Throughout the first chapter of Isaiah, blood sacrifices are regarded as trivial and insignificant, and the prophet encourages the nation not to depend on them. Thus, the moving portrait of the scarlet transforming to white stands as a living monument to the prophet's inspiring message on bloodless atonement. This profound teaching deals a devastating blow to the core teachings of Christianity. Missionaries attempt to counter this point by claiming that Isaiah was simply condemning insincere sacrifices; but this assertion is incorrect. Isaiah loudly declares that charity and acts of kindness alone atone for man's most grievous sins, as he repeatedly and resoundingly trivializes the blood sacrificial system as an efficacious means for atonement. \n \n While Shimon HaTzaddik officiated for 40 years as high priest, the nation was inspired by his good will and they emulated him. As a result, the atonement outlined in Isaiah was efficacious and the scarlet ribbon always turned white. The people knew that God had forgiven them.\n \n In the years that followed the death of Shimon HaTzaddik, the people's dedication to his golden rule slacked off, and consequently, there were some years when the ribbon turned white and others when it did not. \n \n Sadly, we can now also understand why 40 years prior to the destruction of the second Temple this auspicious miracle ended. It was during these calamitous four decades when Isaiah's words of condemnation were personified.\n \n Even as I write this letter, in the shadow of Yitzhak Rabin's assassination, it is still difficult to imagine a time when baseless hatred could have become so widespread that murders had became commonplace among my people. I vividly recall the traumatic days that followed the death of Rabin. It seemed as though humanity was almost overcome by a sense of stunned bewilderment. Men and women wondered aloud how something like this could have happened. I remember how people were appalled, not just by the fact that the leader of the Jewish State was assassinated, but almost equally as shocking, that it was a Jew who had committed this unimaginable crime. This sort of hate should never have occurred among Jews, people thought. Yet it did. \n \n As we consider a desperate time in our first century history, let us free ourselves of this spiritual affliction and turn toward each other with godly affection. May this repentance bring about the coming of the true messiah, quickly in our time.\n \n Sincerely yours,\n \n Rabbi Tovia Singer\n \n \n Footnotes:\n \n Click on the footnote to return to the article\n \n 1A Baraisa is a statement made by a Tanna which was not included by Rabbi Yehudah Ha'nasi (approximately 200 C.E.) in the Mishnah.\n \n 2See Leviticus 16:7-10.\n \n 3The second Temple was destroyed by the Romans in approximately the year 70 C.E.\n \n 4The Aramaic word Yoma means \"The Day,\" and it refers to Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement.\n \n 5Shimon HaTzaddik (Simon the Just) succeeded Ezra during the early part of the second Temple period and officiated as high priest for forty years.
