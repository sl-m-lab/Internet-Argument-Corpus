What do you mean by destroyed? \n \n Why does that genetic disadvantage (or any) still linger today if evolution were to have reached the point of stopping? \n \n Evolution has NOT stopped, but since we now control much more of our environment than our primitive ancestors we're subjected to different selection pressures than our ancestors. As to why genetic disadvantages still linger, I think you have the wrong idea about evolution. Evolution is about differential reproductive success, not about eliminating genetic disadvantages. IN this case, if a primitive human had poor eye site, he was more likely to die from natural causes before he had any children to pass his genes to, and if he did manage to survive and have children that had poor eye site, they would be less likely to survive to pass their genes on. This would go on until the genes for poor eyesight were eliminated from the population. This doesn't apply in modern society. Those with poor eyesight aren't at a greater risk than those without. They are just as likely to live long enough to pass on their genes to their children. There is no selective pressure for keen eyesight. \n \n Not just in humans, but in any living being? \n \n Same rules apply for all life.\n \n Why does a bird still get eaten by a cat? \n \n Once again, you don't seem to grasp the theory of evolution. Sometimes the bird gets eaten, sometimes the bird gets away. Even though birds do get eaten by cats, more birds survive to have offspring than get eaten.

I'm not absolutely sure about this but I think that the average height is going way up (just look at the NBA, 6 feet is considered short). When more tall people breed with tall people, they are more likely to produce a tall person. We really have no evolution because they need a charactaristic to survive, because we have essentially gotten rid of that. If someone is really slow and can't get away from a predator, that's ok because we put them in a big house and have police with guns to stop any non-human from attacking someone.\n \n But how about this from evolution? Why do you think antibiotics are losing their effectiveness? The stuff causing the disease dies off if they can't fight off the antibiotic, they reproduce (even if they reproduce asexually, they make copies of themselves) and create more creatures that are immune to that antibiotic, so after a generation every organism that causes the disease is now immune to the antibiotic. That is evolution.\n \n You have to realize that evolution doesn't even try to address how life started. Evolution simply states the obvious, that things change, and that if a charactaristic is important to life, then either the species will die out, or after generations that characteristic will occur in almost all instances of that species.

It's not because the antibiotic changed.\n \n Here is link to paper about medicine and evolution (written by scientists - of medicine, biology and evolution). Below is the relevant passage.\n \n http://www.direct-ms.org/articles/Evolution-OriginsOfDisease.pdf\n \n Humanity won huge battles in the war against pathogens with the development of antibiotics and vaccines. Our victories were so rapid and seemingly complete that in 1969 U.S. Surgeon General William H. Stewart said that it was \"time to close the book on infectious disease.\" But the enemy,\n and the power of natural selection, had been underestimated. The sober reality is that pathogens apparently can adapt to every chemical researchers develop. (\"The war has been won,\" onescientist more recently quipped. \"By the other side.\")\n \n Antibiotic resistance is a classic demonstration of natural selection. Bacteria that happen to have genes that allow them to prosper despite the presence of an antibiotic reproduce faster than others, and so the genes that confer resistance spread quickly. As shown by Nobel laureate Joshua Lederberg of the Rockefeller University, they can even jump to different species of bacteria, borne on bits of infectious DNA. Today some strains of tuberculosis in New York City are resistant to all three main antibiotic treatments; patients with those strains have no better chance of surviving than did TB patients a century ago. Stephen S. Morse of Columbia University notes that the multidrug-resistant strain that has spread throughout the East Coast may have originated in a homeless shelter across the street from Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center. Such a phenomenon would indeed be predicted in an environment where fierce selection pressure quickly weeds out less hardy strains. The surviving bacilli have been bred for resistance.",

The fact you believe that bacteria don't become resistant to certain antibiotics (something nearly every qualified doctor in the Western World will tell you). Have you been taught it in school yet? In England, you learn about it between 14 and 16, so maybe you've not had anyone explain it to you yet? You're 14, so maybe it hasn't come up yet? It's not meant to be patronising, but there's little point arguing with someone who has absolutely no knowledge of the matter. Denying evolution occurs will get you ridiculed. Denying that bacteria become resistant to antibiotics, is the equivalent of denying gravity exists.\n \n What's a mutation? What's an allele? What's a virus? What's a bacterium? What's mitosis? What's a dominant/recessive allele? Before discussing whether evolution occurs, you have to know these things. Clearly you don't.\n \n http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/biology/variationandinheritance/index.shtml\n \n That is designed to teach people about genetics (and evolution) for English gcse's, taken by pupils aged 15-16. It's not rocket science. It's not hard. 30-60mins of your time is needed and you might understand what evolution is and how it occurs. Then you can start to debate whether it is \"true\" or not.\n \n -Wez",

Evolution isn't evolving us into something \"better\". That's not what evolution is or how it works. Evolution is about differential reproductive success. Why is cancer spreading throughout the world? Because once you have children, your genes are passed on and if you get cancer after that, it doesn't matter, you've already passed your genes on, natural selection hasn't come into play and those cancer producing genes haven't been selected against. So evolution isn't about becoming something better, it's about having more offspring and spreading your genes.\n \n \nthen what else is evolving? a camel into a giraffe? i dont see anything else that is evolving!\n \n \n What else is evolving? Virtually all life is evolving, just because you can't see it doesn't mean it isn't happening.

But evolution is only about speciation, and we have seen speciation events, and yes, this is macroevolution, so we have observed macroevolution, it is a fact.\n But if you want to see an unambiguous example of evolution in action, look at the duckbill platypus, it is transitional between reptiles and mammals and the only valid explaination for it it evolution.\n \n \nyou know what the problem is. you guys will take anything that changes within ten years and somehow connect it to evolution. thentruth is our technology is very slow to advance. were discovering new things and calling them changes. like if we discover a new disease theyll say its a different disease just \"evolved\"\n \n \n No, we can look at the genetic material of organisms now and actually see when new mutations occurred, when a new species arises.

   "Demon38,\n \n I have one minor quibble about something that you posted. You said that evolution is about differential reproductive success. That is a description of natural selection rather than evolution. Granted that natural selection is a major mechanism in evolution, but there are at least 5 other commonly recognized mechanisms of evolution. Possibly you are correct since I have never considered the others in that light. However, I suspect that you are equating evolution with natural selection. It may be due to the understanding of the topic evidenced by creationists. Maybe you are trying to keep it simple for them.\n \n So here are the mechanisms of evolution that I learned some years ago. I have seen some others claimed, that apparently didn't impress me all that much or that I didn't understand, and that I therefore don't remember. Quite possibly you may know of these.\n \n 1. Natural selection: differential reproductive success. Advantageous characters lend a statistical reproductive advantage to organisms. A recently discussed example is antibiotic resistance in bacteria. Another is the ability to take advantage of a previously unavailable food source - this may be for a variety of hereditary causes.\n \n 2. Sexual selection: Peacocks have such large tails because peahens seem to prefer them. The tail itself doesn't lend a reproductive advantage. In fact, males without that beautiful tail tend to survive longer. However, they also tend to produce fewer offspring. I guess this mechanism also offers differential reproductive success.\n \n 3. Genetic drift: Insignificant in large populations but quite meaningful in small populations. The well known evolutionary principle of the founder effect is primarily due to the genetic drift. In small populations the number of random matings is limited and as a result alleles may be eliminated from a population by chance. I think that this is not differential reproductive success.\n \n All of the above are mechanisms that tend to reduce genetic diversity. Natural selection tends to favor advantageous characters over those that are less advantageous - it is a statistical advantage. Sexual selection tends to favor characters that are pleasing to members of the opposite sex. A peacock that sports a large, beautiful tail must be a more desirable mate since he has managed to survive in spite of the disadvantage of that tail.\n \n The following are mechanisms that increase the genetic diversity in populations.\n \n 4. Mutation: The other side of the coin of natural selection. Mutations are the major mechanism of new genetic information in a population. Granted that many mutations are detrimental. Many more have no immediate effect. But some are viable, and they, with the neutral mutations, supply the genetic diversity that fuels evolution.\n \n 5. Recombination: A process of sexual reproduction. It is a process by which a pair of alleles for separate genes that were previously associated on a single chromosome are separated and transferred to another chromosome. The primary mechanism is crossover.\n \n 6. Gene flow: The introduction of novel alleles into a population from random mating with closely related immigrant or emigrant populations.\n \n So what do you think?",

As you know, that's not what evolution is about. Maybe I should have said evolution is driven by differential reproductive success, genetic changes, when selected for by the environment, will give some members of a population\n an advantage in passing on their genes. I was trying to make the point that better in evolutionary terms is simply being able to have more surviving offspring to further pass on those genes, so \"better\" is a relative term. \n I must admit though that I liked your summation of evolution, you covered all the important points.

   "BushAllTheWay\"\n \n I'll try and dumb it down for you a bit.\n \n Basically what happens with evolution is this: When things reproduce, their offspring are slightly genetically different. \n \n Example - If a pair of mice mate and produce thirty offspring, there might be 20 white ones, five black ones, and five grey ones.\n \n As those offspring mature into adults and produce their own offspring, some will be more succesful than others.\n \n Example - All of the white mice are eaten by cats because they are easier to hunt. Two of the black mice are also eaten, since it is easier to hunt black mice than grey mice.\n \n These succesful offspring mate, and the traits which made them more succesful are passed on.\n \n Example - We are left with five grey mice, and three black mice. They each produce 30 offspring (with random unrelated mice). But since all the white mice have been eaten, the gene for white mice is no longer in this breeding population. So instead we have 150 grey mice, and 90 black mice.\n \n Following this process, the most succesful mutations and traits become the dominant ones. This is the process of evolution. \n \n NB - the above examples make a few assumptions about dominant/recessive genes for colours in mice, and is only intended as a very broad example to illustrate the methods by which creatures evolve.",

This process occurred in nature but was experimentally reproduced. Galeopsis pubescens and G. speciosa were crossed to produce F1 hybrids, most of which were sterile. Nevertheless, both F2 and F3 generations were produced. The F3 generation included a polyploid plant with 2n = 32 that self-fertilized to yield fertile F4 offspring that could not mate with either of the parental species. These allopolyploid plants had the same appearance and chromosome number as the naturally occurring G. tetrahit. When the experimentally produced plants were crossed with the naturally occurring G. tetrahit, a fertile F1 generation was formed. Thus, the experiment duplicated the speciation process that occurred in nature.\" (Biology: Fifth Edition, Eldra Pearl Solomon, Linda R. Berg, and Diana W.

   "[BushAllTheWay,] Why do you deny that bacteria evolve?\n \n I'll give you an example of evolution, see if you can take it apart:\n \n 1) 1 Bacteria put in a petri dish\n 2) Bacteria clones itself\n 3) Antibiotic added\n 4) All bar one bacteria die\n 5) That one bacteria reproduces\n 6) The bacteria now in the petri dish is a different bacteria to the one originally added.\n \n How is that not an example of evolution?\n \n -Wez\n\n \n To add to that quite valid logic, here are couple actual examples of bacteria evolving in a lab. \n \n \n\"4.) Adaptation to a Low Phosphate Chemostat Environment by a Clonal Line of Yeast \n \n P.E. Hansche and J.C. Francis set up chemosats to allow evolution of a single clonal line of beer yeast in a phosphate limited (due to high pH) environment. (A chemostat is a device that allows the propagation of microorganisms in an extremely constant environment.) The yeast clones grew slowly for about the first 180 generations when there was an abrupt increase in population density. This was later shown to be due to better assimilation of the phosphate, presumably due to an improvement in the permease molecule. (Permease is an enzyme that controls what is allowed to come into the cell through the yeast's cell membrane.) After about 400 generations, a second improvement in cell growth rates occurred because of a mutation to the yeast's phosphatase (an enzyme that improves the cells ability to use phosphate). The phosphatase became more active overall, and its optimal pH (the pH where it is most active) was raised. Finally, a third mutant appeared after 800 generations that caused the yeast cells to clump. This raised the population density in the chemostat because individual cells were no longer being washed out of chemostat (which is one of the methods that the chemostat uses to maintain very uniform conditions) as quickly as they had prior to the mutation. (This is just speculation on my part, but I wonder if it wasn't under some similar conditions that multi-cellularity became favored over unicellularity - perhaps on a sea bed or river bottom.) \n \n This experiment was repeated, and the same mutations occurred, but in different orders. Also, in one replication, the processing of phosphate was improved by a duplication of the gene that produces phosphatase. This is experimental evidence of an extremely important mechanism in evolutionary history! It is also a particularly elegant experiment because not only was all of this adaptation shown to occur in clonal lines (descended from a single individual), but the authors also determined the exact mutations that caused the improved adaptations by sequencing the genes and proteins involved.\" (http://www.gate.net/~rwms/EvoMutations.html) \n\n \n \n \n \n\"Evolution of New Metabolic Pathways \n \n ...\n \n Xylitol is also not normally metabolized, but Mortlock and his colleagues were able to develop strains (generally through spontaneous mutations, but sometimes with u.v. ray or chemical induced mutations) that could use it because ribitol dehydrogenase (which is usually present in the cells to convert ribitol to D-ribulose) was able to slightly speed up the conversion of xylitol to D-xylulose, for which metabolic pathways already exist. The ability of the strains to utilize xylitol was increased as much as 20 fold when first production of ribitol dehydrogenase was deregulated (the enzyme was produced all the time, not just when ribitol was present), then duplication of the ribitol dehydrogenase genes occurred, then the structure of the enzyme was changed such that its efficiency at working with xylitol was improved, and finally, in at least one case, a line regained control of the modified ribitol dehydrogenase gene so that the enzyme was only produced in the presence of xylitol. Here we have a complete example of a new metabolic pathway being developed through duplication and modification of an existing pathway. \" (http://www.gate.net/~rwms/EvoMutations.html) \n\n \n \n Here's a breakdown.\n \n 1) ribitol deyhydrogenase, an enzyme whose primary substrate is ribitol, can slightly accelerate the rate of conversion of non-usable xylitol into a usable sugar, D-xylulose. \n \n Note that one enzyme being able to catalyze several related reactions is not unusual (despite what some anti-evolutionsts would have us believe).\n \n \n 2) then one or more mutations in the gene(s) that control the expression of ribitol dehydrogenase cause it to begin being expressed continuously (not just in response to the presence of ribitol). This increased the cells' ability to utilize xylitol 20 fold\n \n 3) then a mutation caused the genes coding for the enzyme ribitol dehydrogenase to be duplicated\n \n A common mechanism evolution employs is duplicate-and-diverge. After a gene duplication, having two copies of the gene allows one of them to accept mutations without harming fitness (the other one remains the same and continues to carry out its function). This way, the gene/protein can search through similar sequences and possibly find a new function, or, in this case, improve an existing function.\n \n \n 4) then one or more mutations in the genes coding for ribitol dehydrogenase increased it's ability to catalyze the xylitol-to-D-xylulose conversion \n \n 5) then one or more mutations linked expression of one of the ribitol dehydrogenase genes to the presence of xylitol\n \n \n Thus, a new, regulated metabolic pathway arising via a chain of beneficial mutations.",
