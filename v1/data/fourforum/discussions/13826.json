   "Interesting analysis... \n \n Geoffrey R. Stone: The Conservative Case for Gay Marriage: Let Me Get This Straight \nIn the cover story of the most recent issue of Newsweek, Ted Olson, who along with David Boies is litigating a potentially landmark challenge to the constitutionality of California's Proposition 8, makes what he describes as \"The Conservative Case for Gay Marriage.\" Olson makes an eloquent and compelling case against the constitutionality of state prohibitions of same-sex marriage. \n \n Olson notes that his involvement in the litigation \"has generated a certain degree of consternation among conservatives.\" He finds this puzzling. Indeed, he insists that the conservative opposition to same-sex marriage \"does not make sense, because same-sex unions promote the values conservatives prize.\" Indeed, given their most fundamental values, he explains, conservatives should \"celebrate\" the desire of two individuals to form \"a union based on shared aspirations.\" Moreover, legalizing same-sex marriage would further \"basic American principles\" and \"represent the culmination of our nation's commitment to equal rights.\" Our historic dedication to the \"principle of equality,\" he asserts, is central not only to Democrats and liberals, but also to Republicans and conservatives.\n \n Olson is a brilliant lawyer. He offers a logically unimpeachable case for his position. But what he makes is the liberal case for gay marriage, or perhaps (as he suggests) the American case for gay marriage, but not -- unfortunately -- the conservative case for gay marriage. The plain and simple fact is that conservatives do not believe in what Olson identifies as our \"bedrock\" American values. And therein lies his problem.\n \n To begin with, it's important to note the sharpness of the divide between conservatives and liberals on this issue. According to recent polls, only 14% of conservatives support same-sex marriage, compared to 72% of liberals. Why is this so? Basically, liberals already understand and accept the three central points of Olson's argument: (1) equality is a fundamental constitutional right; (2) a person's sexual orientation is determined at birth, and it is especially unfair to treat people unequally because of factors over which they have no control; (3) there is no good reason to deny gays and lesbians the right to marry, and religion, in particular, is not a constitutionally legitimate basis for treating people unequally. Liberals generally embrace each of these points, but conservatives do not. \n \n (1) Almost all people say they believe in equality, but the real truth is that throughout American history it has traditionally been liberals rather than conservatives who have fought for equal rights for African-Americans, women, religious minorities, and political dissenters. In most of these battles, conservatives either sat on the sidelines or actively defended the status quo.\n \n (2) Like Olson, almost 60% of liberals believe that sexual orientation is determined at birth, but only 21% of conservatives accept this. Most conservatives apparently cling to the discredited belief that sexual orientation is merely a choice of \"lifestyle.\" \n \n (3) Although Olson effectively demonstrates that there is no reasonable justification for prohibiting same-sex marriage, only 14% of conservatives agree. What's going on here? The answer, as Olson intimates, is religion. Almost one-half of all conservatives believe that the Bible rather than the will of the People should determine public policy in the United States. Those who attend church services weekly supported Proposition 8 by a vote of 84% to 16%, whereas those who do not attend church regularly opposed Proposition 8 by a vote of 83% to 17%. Olson rejects \"religious teachings that denounce homosexuality as morally wrong\" and believes that the Constitution \"prohibits us from forcing our religious beliefs on others.\" But most conservatives don't agree with him.\n \n Olson's problem, then, is that although he has made out a powerful and persuasive case for holding laws banning same-sex marriage unconstitutional, he has not made \"The Conservative Case for Gay Marriage.\" It's time Ted Olson sucked it up and recognized that, at least on this issue, he is a liberal. And he's right to be one.\n",

   "Interesting analysis... \n \n Geoffrey R. Stone: The Conservative Case for Gay Marriage: Let Me Get This Straight\n\n \n The fact is that much of what this author states to be is absolutely false and perfectly represents the distortions of the liberal left. And that is precisely why its type of rationalization never entered the thinking of the voters who voted against gay marriage in California.\n \n \n \n(1) Almost all people say they believe in equality, but the real truth is that throughout American history it has traditionally been liberals rather than conservatives who have fought for equal rights for African-Americans, women, religious minorities, and political dissenters. In most of these battles, conservatives either sat on the sidelines or actively defended the status quo.\n\n \n Here is the first LIE and rewriting of history by a proponent of gay marriage. If anyone actually studies the civil rights movement they will plainly see that it was the southern democrats who plunged us first into the civil war under Lincoln's administration by attempting succession rather than freeing the slaves, and it was the DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS who fought civil rights legislation right up to the 60s before finally passing a weaker bill than was submitted by a Republican at the time. Al Gore Senior was one of the loudest opposers of civil rights. And was George Wallace and Governor Patterson, Governors who refused to honor or enforce equal rights after passage, Republicans or a Democrats? For you children from Rio Linda, they were Democrats. They fought desegregation at every level of the process.\n \n \n(2) Like Olson, almost 60% of liberals believe that sexual orientation is determined at birth, but only 21% of conservatives accept this. Most conservatives apparently cling to the discredited belief that sexual orientation is merely a choice of \"lifestyle.\"\n\n \n Of course throughout the whole Genome Project, although they have searched high and low for the gay gene, and they know where to look, they can't seem to find it. But I wouldn't deny that some chemical screw up in the fetal stage of development might not impact the sexual proclivities in some human beings. But so what if that is true? \n \n According to the bible, the sin nature affects all aspects of our lives from diseases to the aging process to unnatural proclivities to sins such as rape, murder, adultery, homosexuality, incest, susceptibility to sex, alcohol and drug addiction, and innumerable other activities of the flesh which declare that we are seriously flawed due to our fall from grace which was brought about by our original sin of rebellion against God by disobeying Him via Adam and Eve. So there exists no consensus at all which declares that the liberal/secular humanist interpretation of reality is in any way correct. But that doesn't stop your side from claiming victory as the correct interpreters of the non-evidence.\n \n \n (3) Although Olson effectively demonstrates that there is no reasonable justification for prohibiting same-sex marriage, only 14% of conservatives agree. What's going on here? The answer, as Olson intimates, is religion. Almost one-half of all conservatives believe that the Bible rather than the will of the People should determine public policy in the United States. Those who attend church services weekly supported Proposition 8 by a vote of 84% to 16%, whereas those who do not attend church regularly opposed Proposition 8 by a vote of 83% to 17%. Olson rejects \"religious teachings that denounce homosexuality as morally wrong\" and believes that the Constitution \"prohibits us from forcing our religious beliefs on others.\" But most conservatives don't agree with him.\n\n \n Count me as one of those 14% since he hasn't demonstrated anything of the sort. And it isn't imposing our religion on anyone at all just because we rely on scriptural values in determining what is right and wrong in life. This is the greatest corruption of common sense that can be revealed regarding how the humanist thinks. \n \n What better way to erase scriptural based morality from the public debate than to assert that just by holding to a biblical value system in life is to impose ones religion on the atheist? This is the goal and defines the agenda of the atheist as it proves that at every level of public discourse it is their goal to claim that any spiritually based value system which opposes secular humanism, opposes the Constitution which couldn't be further from the original intent of the Constitution if it tried. The constitution was neither anti-bible or anti-christian. Nor was it anti-spiritual interpretation or application of the laws of the land which is evident by those very laws which exist and compliment spiritual values of christian americans throughout our history.\n \n So your not very interesting opinion piece by these so called intellectuals fail on all counts as they must pervert and corrupt what has always been accepted values in this Country in order to reinterpret history if they hope to succeed in this application.",

   "A conservative Christian woman weighs in on the subject at A Conservative Christian Case for Civil Same-Sex Marriage\n \n Excerpt:\nFor obvious reasons we Christians have always been adamant supporters of civil liberties when it comes to freedom of religion. We have even managed to be consistent in this principle by not opposing the rights of Buddhists, New Agers, or even Satanists to meet, because we realize that to do so would equally undercut our own right to assemble. Perhaps the thought of undermining religious freedom sends through our minds flashes of those days when the Emperor Nero used to ignite Christians as human torches to light the streets of Rome at night. The persecutions against the early church have ingrained into our Christian consciousness the incredible value of living under a government that protects the interests of religion.\n \n But in the case of civil same-sex marriage, instead of recognizing the civil rights issue at stake here, we oppose the idea, quoting Bible verses and appealing to morals, nature, tradition, history, and the fear that Western civilization as we know it will come crashing to the ground. All of these arguments are related, of course. They are an appeal to that part of American society in which Judeo-Christian values are still deeply rooted. For even in America at the dawning of the 21st century, many people's understanding of morality and nature still reflect the vestiges of the Western Christendom of our heritage, as do their ideas of tradition, history and an ideal society.\n \n We do not, however, argue against civil same-sex marriage in the spirit of calm persuasion. There is desperation in our tone. There is also a great deal of fear and mean-spiritedness in our rhetoric, to the point where we even accuse homosexuals (without much proof, I might add) of being child molesters and sexual predators, and of seeking to corrupt our youth by recruiting them into their \"lifestyle.\"\n \n There are probably many people who think they are justified in having such fears, but it seems to me it is more than just paranoia that feeds our frenzy. We feel deeply threatened, for we sense that we are losing the battle. Not simply the battle against homosexuals, but the battle to hang on to what we still think of as \"Christian America.\"\n \n At one time in this country we could count on quoting a verse from Genesis or Leviticus before Congress or the Supreme Court and that would be the end of the debate. No more. The consensus of common biblical values on which we had once depended is giving way to the pluralism of a postmodern society. And seeing the disastrous handwriting on the wall, we have become politically desperate, and so we lunge at the enemies of Christendom with a ferocity that rivals that of even the most radical gay activists.\nThe other articles on her website are also well worth reading: Musings on Christianity, Homosexuality & the Bible",

They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.\"\n \n Romans 1:26-27 - \"Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.\"\n \n 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 - \"Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.\"\n \n 1 Timothy 1:8-10 - \"But we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully, knowing this: that the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine...\"\n \n Jude 7 - \"In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire.\" \n \n There's no gay marriages in the Old Testament; No gay marriages in the New Testament; no gay sex approved anywhere in the Bible. Just the opposite - gay sex is condemned in both testaments. God is consistent on that.\n \n And to close:\n \n \"Whosoever shall be guilty of Rape, Polygamy, or Sodomy with man or woman shall be punished, if a man, by castration, if a woman, by cutting thro' the cartilage of her nose a hole of one half inch diameter at the least.\" - Thomas Jefferson\n \n Amendment VIII: Thomas Jefferson, A Bill for Proportioning Crimes and Punishments",

What type of results, if any, would be acceptable? I didn't say the government is always right or the intended goals are always achieved. That is our fault for putting people in government with the intelligence of carpet and then allowing them to stay.\n \n \nI pointed out the author's bias by assuming it was geneticwithout any demonstrable proof. It may or may not be genetic, but I am not going to make a definitive statement one way or the other without proof. The good law professor had no problem making that leap.\n\n \n Now read it again and don't make a conclusion before you finish this time. He states genetics as a cause twice both times he is quoting a source. The first is the subject of the article the second is a poll. As part of the poll he states conservatives don't accept the liberal opinion for genetics but believe the choice theory which has been discredited. Scientist may not know without a doubt what causes someone to be gay, but they know without a doubt it is not a choice.\n By all means, don't try to redefine marriage and the problem is solved.\n \n \nFor years I've tried to get one of our resident gay members to debate me on that fact. To date, no takers. Want to step up?\n\n On what that drugs and alchohol are not moral equivelants to being gay?\n \n \nI was just following your logic to its ultimate logical conclusion. Liberals don't give a damn about individual freedom; they want governmental control over all aspects of your life. They want gov't control of healthcare because they think we're too dumb to fend for ourselves. They want to indoctrinate our kids in school because they don't trust parents to be parents. The list of liberal intrusisms into our lives is endless. \n\n \n That is just conservative bias. Conservatives are just as guilty of the same things as liberals and then each has their own ideological idiocy that is unique to each group. Conservatives like classes and don't like change. A pure conservative society would fail just as quickly as a pure liberal one. The last 10 - 20 years as we have become more us vs. them the overall prosperity and well being of the country has declined. With both sides taking the country to extremes. Conservatives eased restrictions and corporations run wild. Those laws are in place for a reason. Liberals overreact and put a choke hold on growth. There was a reason for less restrictive laws, but now they can't do anything meaningful.\n \n \nAnd I have no problem with gays, just their attempts to redefine marriage.\n\n \n I agree that if performing a gay marriage is causing religion to be unable to worship as it sees fit that they should not be compelled to do so, but that is where it ends. God and the church recognize the spiritual aspect of marriage not the state. The state recognizes the legal aspect of marriage not religion. Religion is crossing the line by trying to prohibit civil unions legally equal to marriage. You say gays have no right to tell religion what it can and can not do and religion has no right to tell people what they can and can not do",

Good luck finding a news article that is completly objective and balanced. \n\n Nice succinct summary on the state of affair with liberal journalism today. \n \n\n Come on JP really. So what happens when opportunity is not equal? What is the point of doing anything to solve a problem if there is a disregard for achieving measurable results. The whole point of creating an equal opportunity is to correct an imbalance. What type of results, if any, would be acceptable? I didn't say the government is always right or the intended goals are always achieved. That is our fault for putting people in government with the intelligence of carpet and then allowing them to stay.\n \n\n It's not my responsibility to ease job requirements so that an underachiever can reap the same rewards as an achiever. That's not my idea of equality.\n \n\n Now read it again and don't make a conclusion before you finish this time. He states genetics as a cause twice both times he is quoting a source. The first is the subject of the article the second is a poll. As part of the poll he states conservatives don't accept the liberal opinion for genetics but believe the choice theory which has been discredited. Scientist may not know without a doubt what causes someone to be gay, but they know without a doubt it is not a choice.\n\n If there's no proof that it's genetic, then how can one say, with any degree of certainty, that it isn't a matter of choice? The professor attempts to discredit choice by stating there's no proof it is and promote genetics even without any scientific basis to do so. His selective use of \"lack of proof\" as his main criteria is dubious as a result. \n Some make the claim that nobody would \"choose\" to be gay because of all of the psychological baggage that comes with it. The teasing from straights, the parental pressure, etc., but we know that rebellious teens will do a lot of anti-social things by choice, so that argument doesn't fly.\n \n\n By all means, don't try to redefine marriage and the problem is solved.\n \n\n Exactly.\n \n\n On what that drugs and alchohol are not moral equivelants to being gay?\n \n\n No, the fact that HIV/AIDS would not have achieved critical mass in the US if it wasn't for the gay community. Want to take that one on?\n \n\n That is just conservative bias. Conservatives are just as guilty of the same things as liberals and then each has their own ideological idiocy that is unique to each group. Conservatives like classes and don't like change. A pure conservative society would fail just as quickly as a pure liberal one. The last 10 - 20 years as we have become more us vs. them the overall prosperity and well being of the country has declined. With both sides taking the country to extremes. Conservatives eased restrictions and corporations run wild. Those laws are in place for a reason. Liberals overreact and put a choke hold on growth. There was a reason for less restrictive laws, but now they can't do anything meaningful.\n\n \n Your knowledge of history is frightening. We saw how well Sarbane-Oxley, the most far-reaching intrusion into corporate America since FDR, prevented our recent crash. A crash that was precipitated by Clinton's edict to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to loosen up the purse strings so deadbeats could get mortgages. \n \n\n I agree that if performing a gay marriage is causing religion to be unable to worship as it sees fit that they should not be compelled to do so, but that is where it ends. God and the church recognize the spiritual aspect of marriage not the state. The state recognizes the legal aspect of marriage not religion. Religion is crossing the line by trying to prohibit civil unions legally equal to marriage. You say gays have no right to tell religion what it can and can not do and religion has no right to tell people what they can and can not do\n\n \n You mistakenly state that it's religion telling people what to do, it isn't. It's the voters deciding what they will and won't financially support.",

   "More lies as usual as you must distort reality to justify your world view and ignore the meat of my argument. Because I don't condemn any group of people here, I condemn their lifestyle, i.e. their actions, but not them. Unlike many christians I proclaim Gods love for them and their ability to be saved also if only they will sincerely repent as every person must repent and turn away from their sins when they receive Jesus as their personal savior. \n\n \n Its not a lie. You can't hide behind semantics with me. You aren't condemning lifestyles when you tell someone they have no morals (well in reality they simply have moral that don't match your's), that they are going to hell, when you use your political activity to infringe on their family make-up and their ability to work and live free of discrimination. It isn't lifestyles that are getting hurt, its people.\n \n \nBut nice job completely ignoring the FACT that it is your leftist and liberal world view which is founded in the precise philosophies of politically progressive, areligious atheists of the German enlightenment of the early 20th century. The fact is that most modern progressives are so ignorant, they don't even know what admitting to be one entails, ala Hillary Clinton during her Presidential run. \n\n \n I am not a label. My world view is founded in my upbringing and life experiences. So is your's.\n I have no intentions in answering for whatever it is Hillary did that has your panties in a knot. I'm not her. \n \n \nI can't be warned for telling the truth Jito, and everything I've said to you is spot on accurate. So as long as you come here with your condescending arrogance, I will call you what you are. If you don't like it, go back to the morgue @ TCC where anyone who doesn't agree with your views gets banned. emoticon_xgood\n\n \n Your insults and point of view are \"THE TRUTH\" and I am the one who is arrogant? Please.\n \n If thats the way it works, here is MY TRUTH about you. You are a delusional religious wing-nut who thinks that any abuse is acceptable as long as you back it with the Bible. Just like the inquisitors and witch-burners of the past you are nothing more than a self-righteous, narrow-minded bigot. You wield your faith like a club, using it only to hurt others and feed your own ego.",

   "To all of this above, I can respond with the same answer. Balderdash on all counts. \n\n \n Surprise.....\n \n \nYou interpret my correction of your perversion of Gods word as an act of hatred rather than seeing it as a loving and compassionate attempt to lead you to a true salvation experience.\n\n \n Don't sugar coat XXXXXXXX Archie. You can't stand the fact that I'm Christian and gay, and furthermore you call my belief a PERVERSION.\n \n \n \n You then attack me as a hater and a bigot as if my rejection of your lifestyle is a rejection of you personally.\n\n \n It's not a lifestyle. It cannot be changed, and many have until they killed themselves. You seem to grasp at the stigma rather than reality. And YES it is a rejection of ME personally because I am gay!\n \n \n If I was in fact a hater of homosexuals as you imply, I would never even reach out to you with the spiritual truth, I would just place you all on ignore and pray that God condemns you to hell. \n\n \n And yet you condemn my faith in Christ and ridicule me. That is a form of bitter content toward MY faith.\n \n \n \n \nWhat you do is prove that you have no sense of truth or justice within you jason, and just by my pointing that out to you will once again be interpreted by a hateful act on my part. \n\n \n Justice? Justice? How can you even throw that word into any equation especially concerning the fact that many of my basic human rights are denied! Where is the justice for the slain gay man on the street? Or the teenager who committed suicide because they loathe themselves for being gay?\n \n Where is the justice for August Provost and his family? Where is the justice for Matthew Sheppard or Harvey Bernard Milk? Do not dare speak of justice until you realize the weight that word carries.\n \n \nYou can't have even one discussion or debate without playing the victim and making me the hater when all I have ever tried to do is point out the folly of your spiritual blindness.\n\n \n Folly and spiritual blindness. Once again you belittle MY faith. You always complain and bitch about people harping on your beliefs what about mine? Pot paging kettle Archie....\n \n \n \n \n \nHere we go again. I would love for you to quote any posts of mine where I have even discussed not forgiving you for something. \n\n \n Forgiveness is not the word Archie contempt is the word....\n \n \n \nAnd when has the subject of love ever come up between us when we don't even know each other personally?\n\n \n I don't know Archie try reading Christ's word on forgiveness and unconditional love to your brother.... I didn't see any red letters saying anything about it in person....\n \n \n I have no personal investment in you Jason, that would rise to the place of love other than my reason for sharing the TRUTH of true salvation with you which is an act of spiritual love.\n \n But go ahead and post me ever refusing to forgive you for the personal attacks you have levied against me, even once! \n\n \n Personal attacks? You belittle my religion call my partner a whore and suddenly say your a victim!!!\n \n \n \nYou come up with this dung which again attempts to make you appear to be some victim and me to be some spiritual bully just because I refuse to compromise the true gospel message of salvation in favor of your corrupted interpretation of it. And your interpretation is corrupted Jason, of that there is no doubt. \n\n \n Yes my faith is corrupted.... Where is this freedom of religion you shout for Archie? Because my brand of Christianity does not align with your you personally hold me in contempt as some heathen..... Your words show your true intention.\n \n \nHere is what the Lord is saying to you and Matthew, Jason. And He has also said it to me, a straight man, so I pass it on to you in love, not to condemn you, but to warn you that these words are true and apply to each and every human being who has ever lived so I don't say them to condemn, but to save.\n\n \n I read the word of God Archie. And through faith I know Christ loves me for who I am....",

   "Quote:  JJ's (Jazy Jason) gay, get over it!!! \n \n When I (the Lord) say to the wicked, 'O wicked man, you will surely die,' and you do not speak out to dissuade him from his (sinful gay sex) ways, that wicked man will die for his sin, and I will hold you accountable for his blood. 9 But if you do warn the wicked man to turn from his ways and he does not do so, he will die for his sin, but you will have saved yourself. - Ezekiel 33\n \n emoticon_xgood\n\n \n I always knew your activity was completely slef-serving.\n \n The Bible also tells you that if you have done this and they have demonstrated their disinterest that you should leave them alone. Point being - no worries, your good. If this heathen can figure out that you have this covered, I am sure your good and mighty lord has it figured out.",
