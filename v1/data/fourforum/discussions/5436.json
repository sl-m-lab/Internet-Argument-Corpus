   "One of my favorite commentators. We have exchanged several e-mails and sometimes she disagrees with me. But not this time. She also is (or was) affiliated with USA Today. She tells it like it is. Those who support \"hate crime\" laws are the brown shirts of today. Europe (or should I say Eurabia?) is evidently well on its way once again.\n ===============================\n The fallacy of the Fallaci 'fatwa'\n Kathleen Parker \n \n May 27, 2005\n \n So goes my prayerful response to news that Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci will be prosecuted on charges of \"outrage to religion.\" Apparently, the outspoken Fallaci, now in her 70s, has offended some disciples of Islam with her book, \"The Force of Reason,\" and, by Allah, they intend to see she pays for it.\n \n At least they didn't shoot her.\n \n Yet.\n \n You'll recall that last year in Holland, filmmaker Theo van Gogh was fatally shot and stabbed for work deemed unflattering to Islam. A fellow named Mohammed B. confessed to the murder. Recently, two more suspects, both Chechen citizens believed to be linked to a group of Islamic fundamentalists, were arrested in connection with the crime.\n \n Both of these incidents followed another high-profile episode of perceived offense to Islam. In 2002, French author Michel Houellebecq faced trial for calling Islam \"the dumbest religion,\" and for saying the Koran was so badly written it made him \"fall to the ground in despair.\"\n \n The courts acquitted him, but the trend is clear. Criticize Islam and face jail or justice at the hands of a true believer. Is it possible that radical Islam really does hate freedom?\n \n Now, to Durham, N.C., where Wednesday night three crosses were burned in different places around town - in front of an Episcopal church, at a downtown intersection and on a dirt pile near a construction site.\n \n Americans know what burning crosses represent beyond desecration of a religious symbol, and most are disgusted by the act. Most also figure the perps are the sort of folks who, if they bathed, would need a toilet brush and a silo of Lysol.\n \n We might wish the world were rid of these creeps, but alas, life is imperfect and God apparently is still shuffling the deck of human DNA. I say \"cut and deal,\" but then I'm a mere mortal.\n \n Meanwhile, let's be abundantly clear: You can still burn a cross in this country (qualifiers to follow), or flush a Bible down the toilet, or insult Isaiah's writing, or burn a burqa in your front yard and live to see the morrow.\n \n So far.\n \n It is, in fact, illegal to burn a cross on someone else's private property without the owner's permission. (It's a misdemeanor in North Carolina.) But otherwise you can burn to your heart's content as long as you're making a general statement and not trying to intimidate anyone specifically, according to a 2003 Supreme Court decision.\n \n We call that freedom of speech in America, though that freedom is under assault here, too, every time someone demands compensation for hurt feelings, or takes too literally an \"offensive\" cartoon and tries to get the artist fired, or resents criticism of some pet policy and insists on stifling the insult.\n \n Our own laws against hate speech, though perhaps inspired by virtue, are nevertheless first steps toward the sort of tyranny that now threatens to bring down Fallaci.\n \n And for what? Because some thin-skinned fanatics find her words too painful - or too truthful - to bear?\n \n Fallaci fans know her to be a take-no-prisoners journalist who says what people are thinking but dare not utter aloud. I haven't read the book in question, but I have a copy of her previous book, \"The Rage and the Pride,\" on my desk and it is no valentine to Islam.\n \n Nor to others Fallaci finds ethically weak, in her words: \"insects who, disguised as ideologists, journalists, writers, actors, commentators, psycho-analysts, priests, warbling crickets, putains a la page, (that is, polished sluts), only say what they are asked to say.\" Just to give you a taste.\n \n She is equally blunt in her warnings that to the world's jihadists, \"...the West is a world to conquer and subjugate to Islam.\"\n \n You may agree or disagree. You may criticize her writing style or impugn a rhetorical approach that may result in few converts. But there's no defensible reason why she shouldn't be permitted her say.\n \n The freedom to express oneself shouldn't need defending in this country, where we permit anti-abortionists to hoist bloody photos of dismembered fetuses and allow skinheads to proclaim, \"God hates XXXXXXX.\" And, yes, troglodytes to burn crosses in the public square.\n \n We don't have to like them, but to silence them is to invite silence to our own hearths. Better to see and hear hatred in the daylight than to let it fester in the dark. Thus, \"outrage to religion\" isn't a crime, but is a testament to our faith in freedom.\n \n Let's keep it that way, and long live Oriana Fallaci.\n \n http://www.townhall.com/columnists/kathleenparker/printkp20050527.shtml",

Everything else is of no consequence to the usual neo-conservative crowd (who tend to like our anti-semitism laws... emoticon_rolleyes )\n \n \n Europe is going down the same road that it traveled during Hitler's heyday. \n\n \n What road is that?

Neo-nazis also kill more critics than islamo-fascists (recently had a group trying to kill one of our local politicians in Malm\u00f6 for being immigrant and a political strongman)... the threat isn`t muslim extremist, but right wing extremist...\n \n \nAs to whether or not we on the right spoke up when Muslims were allegedly mistreated, the answer is that we probably never heard of the incidents.

Let the courts decide or abolish the law.\n \n I'm happy that you have dated Muslims and found them to be happy. Perhaps it is because you aren't a Muslim and these poor women didn't have to subjected to wearing burqas and the like. They are probably happy to be normal and treated as an equal human being. So I'm happy that you're (or they are) happy.\n \n Now as to this assertion that I want to ALLOW other people to express hatred: I have no choice in the matter. If I believe in the First Amendment allowing free speech I have to. They can, for that matter, get in the middle of town square do this. Even the few Nazis we have in the U.S. have the right to demonstrate and shout their stupid and racist slogans. I don't like it. I don't agree with any of it. I think these people are stupid; almost psychologically damaged to hold such beliefs, but I can't stop them, nor should I. It is protected by law and by the courts here in America. \n \n But there are certain exceptions. It has often been said that free speech doesn't extend to shouting \"fire\" in a crowded theater. Nor incitement to riot. But for Fallaci to be condemned and sued for speaking what she believes to be the truth is unacceptable in a free society. This is the path I believe that Europe has chosen. It is the path of totalitarianism. Check the histories of Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union or any of a number of other rogue regimes of the past. It's all the same. First it is political correctness. Discourage and defame people who speak out. Then pass some laws to explicitly make it illegal. Then when the government falls to a dictator, round up the dissidents and put a bullet in the back of their heads. And for good measure send the bill to their relatives to rub it in. That's Europe in a few years unless they start addressing issues and speaking the truth even when it hurts or is \"politically incorrect.\"",
