   "I think we should all get acquinted with a variety of terms.\n \n The Institute of Nanotechnology offers a great definition of this relatively new field of engineering and science. Nanotechnology is a interdisciplinary field dedicated to work where atoms, molecules, circuitry, and mechanican devices are manipulated in ranges where the order of magnitude is very small. There are a number of applications for this technology including biotechnology, electronics, communications, and weapons systems. This field is raising serious ethical questions that have implications for the future of humanity.\n \n Source: Institute of Nanotechnology\n \n Fuzzy logic has to do with inductive reasoning. In formal logic we say that a statement is either true or false, 1 or 0. Computers use boolean logic to operate. Inductive logic relates more to how humans think. If 0 means false, and 1 means true, we are intersted in statements that fall within this range. These statements have to do with a degree of certainty falling within the ranges of 0.0000001 to 09999999. Many statements are colloquial. We say things like that is hot, without giving the precise temperature rating. Although fuzzy logic dates back to Greek philosophy, it is a new idea in the field of computers. Here we are concerned with how to get computers to understand vague relations and how do we get them to \"think\" inductively, rather than deductively. Dr. Lofti A. Zadeh was the first to articulate this idea in his 1965 paper on fuzzy sets. Since that time, it has taken off as its own discipline. Know one really knows where this idea will take us in the future.\n \n sources: Dr. Zadeh's homepage\n Tutorial by James F. Brule' (excellent description for the layman)\n \n Perhaps Dr. Zadeh's dream can be better accomplished through quantum computing. Here is a nice description of the field.\n \n Source: An introduction courtesy of Jacob West out of Caltech.",

   "It appears that the University of California at San Diego has uncovered genetic evidence linking the Hox gene to limb supression. This could very well be a reasonable explantion for early evolution, and most surely provides an explanation for changes in type. For instance, this discovery gives us an idea how crustaceans could have evolved to form early insects hundreds of million years ago. Credit for this discovery goes to Matthew Ronshaugen.

Currently, it takes 5 days to detect pathogens like Cryptosporidium or Clostridium botulinum. With this new DNA fingerprinting method the time will be cut down to 15 minutes!
