What a terrific Senator he has been, championing equal rights for gay people, for women, for African Americans, for the poor, for the disabled. I hope he can hang on a little longer, to enjoy a Democratic victory in November. I am holding him in the light, as the Quakers do. He has certainly been a supporter of gay people, as few others in the Senate have been.",
