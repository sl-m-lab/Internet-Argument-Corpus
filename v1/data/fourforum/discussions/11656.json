   "Hitler and Christianity\n \n Hi all. I'm just passing through. I got bored with the GC forum and decided to take a walk through some of the threads here. In doing so I noticed more than one reference implying that Hitler was a Christian. He was in fact not a Christian. He rejected Christianity's tenets early and often. Here is just one example of his feelings towards Christianity, expressed while sharing a private meal with others of a similar mind:\n \n \"The war will be over one day. I shall then consider that my life's final task will be to solve the religious problem. Only then will the life of the German native be guaranteed once and for all. \n \n I don't interfere in matters of belief. Therefore, I can't allow churchmen to interfere in temporal affairs. The organized lie must be smashed. The State must remain the absolute master. \n \n When I was younger, I thought it was necessary to set about matters with dynamite. I've since realized that there's room for a little subtlety. The rotten branch falls of itself. The final state must be: in St. Peter's Chair, a senile officiant; facing him, a few sinister old women, as gaga and as poor in spirit as anyone could wish. The young and healthy are on our side. Against a church that identifies itself with the State, as in England, I have nothing to say. But, even so, it's impossible eternally to hold humanity in bondage with lies. After all, it was only between the sixth and eighth centuries that Christianity was imposed upon our peoples by princes who had an alliance or interest with the shavelings. Our peoples had previously succeeded in living all right without this religion. I have six divisions of SS composed of men absolutely indifferent in matters of religion. It doesn't prevent them from going to their deaths with serenity in their souls. \n \n Christ was an Aryan, and St. Paul used his doctrine to mobilize the criminal underworld and thus organize a proto-Bolshevism. This intrusion upon the world marks the end of a long reign, that of the clear Graeco-Latin genius.\n \n What is this God who takes pleasure only in seeing men grovel before Him? Try to picture to yourselves the following, quite simple story. God creates the conditions for sin. Later on He succeeds, with the help of the Devil, in causing man to sin. Then He employs a virgin to bring into the world a son who, by His death, will redeem humanity!\n \n I can imagine people being enthusiastic about the paradise of Mahomet, but as for the insipid paradise of the Christians! In your lifetime, you used to hear the music of Richard Wagner. After your death, it will be nothing but hallelujahs, the waiving of palms, children of an age for the feeding-bottle, and hoary old men. The man of the isles pays homage to the forces of nature. But Christianity is an invention of sick brains: one could imagine nothing more senseless, nor any more indecent way of turning the idea of the Godhead into a mockery. A negro with his taboos is crushingly superior to the human being who seriously believes in Transubstantiation. \n \n I begin to lose all respect for humanity when I think that some people on our side, Ministers or generals, are capable of believing that we cannot triumph without the blessing of the Church. Such a notion is excusable in little children who have learnt nothing else.\n \n For thirty years the Germans tore each other to pieces simply in order to know whether they should take Communion in both kinds. There's nothing lower than religious notions like that. From that point of view, one can envy the Japanese. They have a religion which is very simple and brings them into contact with nature. They've succeeded even in taking Christianity and turning it into a religion that's less shocking to the intellect.\n \n By what would you have me replace the Christian's picture of the Beyond? What comes naturally to mankind is the sense of eternity and that sense is at the bottom of every man. The soul and the mind migrate, just as the body returns to nature. Thus life is eternally reborn from life. As for the \"Why?\" of all that, I feel no need to rack my brains on the subject. The soul is unplumbable.\n \n If there is a God, at the same time a He gives man life He gives him intelligence. By regulating my life according to the understanding that is granted me, I may be mistaken, but I act in good faith. The concrete image of the Beyond that religion forces on me does not stand up to examination. Think of those who look down from on high upon what happens on earth: what a martyrdom for them, to see human beings indefatigably repeating the same gestures, and inevitably the same errors!\n \n In my view, H. S. Chamberlain was mistaken in regarding Christianity as a religion upon the spiritual level.\n \n Man judges everything in relation to himself. What is bigger than himself is big, what is smaller is small. Only one thing is certain, that one is part of the spectacle. Everyone finds his own role. Joy exists for everybody, I dream of a state of affairs in which every man would know that he lives and dies for the preservation of the species. It's our duty to encourage that idea: let the man who distinguishes himself in service to the species be thought worthy of the highest honors.\n \n What a happy inspiration, to have kept the clergy out of the Party! On the 21st March 1933, at Potsdam, the question was raised: with the Church, or without the Church? I conquered the State despite the malediction pronounced on us by both creeds. On that day, we went directly to the tomb of the kings whilst the others were visiting religious services. Supposing that at that period I'd made a pact with the Churches, I'd today be sharing the lot of the Duce. By nature the Duce is a free-thinker, but he decided to choose the path of concessions. For my part, in his place I'd have taken the path of revolution. I'd have entered the Vatican and thrown everybody out-reserving the right to apologize later: \"Excuse me, it was a mistake.\" But the result would have been, they'd have been outside!\n When all is said, we have no reason to wish that the Italians and Spaniards should free themselves from the drug of Christianity. Let's be the only people who are immunized against the disease.\"\n \n Adolph Hitler, Hitler's Table Talk, 1941-1944, His Private Conversations, 3nd.

   "This is not the first time I have heard the claim that Borman or some other high party official is the source for Hitler's private anti-Christian expressions. While the \"Borman conspiracy\" is interesting theory it is devoid of proof. There is in fact direct proof that neither Borman nor Rosenberg altered the text of Hitler's table ramblings. \n \n But before I get to that let me ask a question: What was it about Hitler that attracted so many men who were anti-Christian like Borman?\n \n Now for the proof. \n \n The \"Borman conspiracy\" theory rests upon these facts: \n \n When Hess fled to Germany, Borman succeeded him as Secretary to the Fuhrer. Hitler was known to wax eloquent to his yes men when dining, and what we now call \"Hitler's Table Talk\" began as Borman's project to record this private \"wisdom\" of Hitler. His expressions were recorded by what we would call a \"secretary\" and the project began on July 5, 1941. The notes taken were provided to Borman who approved them and then forwarded them to his wife. His wife then made two copies. One was placed in the official party archives, and Borman kept a private copy for himself. The archive copy was destroyed by fire near the end of the war, but the private \"Frau Borman\" copy remained intact. That copy was later given by Frau Borman to another party official, who ultimately sold it after the war to a Swiss citizen, a Mr. Francois Genoud. This is the source of the \"Borman conspiracy,\" which suggests that Borman and/or others added the anti-Christian thoughts to the surviving copy. \n \n This theory is all based upon supposition, however, and it neglects one serious flaw. Hitler approved this project, and was aware the record would be kept in the Party archives. What would have happened it Hitler had simply said something like: \"hey, remember when I was talking to Himmler about the Pope last December? Go pull that out and let me see it again\"? What evidence is there to suggest Borman or anyone else was willing to risk Hitler's wrath should he suddenly discover they were putting words in his mouth he neither knew or approved of? The only other explanation would have us believe, without any proof, that a clean copy was placed in the archives while an anti-Christian \"Bormanized\" copy was kept by the Frau. \n \n But the conclusive proof of the authenticity of the words attributed to Hitler comes from how they were recorded and how they survived the war.\n \n The original \"secretary\" was a lawyer named Heinrich Heim. He recorded the expressions from inception of the project in July 5, 1941 until mid march, 1942, at which time he was tasked with other duties, and the duty for the recordings was passed to Dr. Henry Picker. Dr. Picker continued to take the notes and pass them to Borman (Heim ultimately returned to resume the \"secretary\" duties on August 1, 1942). The preface to the 3rd. edition of the English copy of the talks addresses these men thus: \n \n \"Both Heim and Picker were sound Party members, personally known to Hitler and trusted by him, and there can be no doubt that the record was conscientiously made.\" Adolph Hitler, Hitler's Table Talk, 1941-1944, His Private Conversations, Preface to the 3rd Edition, p.vii.\n \n However, and fatally for the \"Borman conspiracy,\" Dr. Picker-secretly and without authorization from Borman or anyone else-decided to keep a duplicate copy of his original notes for himself. Like Heim, Dr. Picker was charged with writing down as accurately as possible what the master said. Borman got what he thought was the only copy of this written recording from Picker, but Picker kept a secret copy for himself. Neither Borman, nor Rosenberg, nor anyone else ever knew this. Additionally, and with equal secrecy, Dr. Picker gained access to several original notes taken by Heim, and he furtively copied these as well. No one had an opportunity to insert anti-Christian thoughts into these copies, for only Dr. Picker knew they existed. \n \n Dr. Picker and his copies survived the war. He published his original copies and those he copied from Heim in German in 1951. Mr. Genoud-who thought he had purchased a sole copyright by buying what he presumed was the only surviving copy of these notes-sued him for copyright infringement and lost. Genoud then published his entire copy (the private \"Frau Borman\" copy) in French-whereupon Dr. Picker sued him for copyright infringement for publishing the portions he had already published. Dr. Picker lost his suit as well. The point, however, is that the text from each of the copies were in agreement. Dr. Picker's secret original copies were the same as the alleged \"Bormanized\" copies. \n \n The evidence which exists on this subject proves that Neither Borman nor Rosenberg nor any other Party official altered the recordings of Hitler's meal-time ramblings. \n \n Here, then, is another of Hitler's expressions on Christianity, and the Bible in particular, as recorded by Dr. Picker, and for which both mutually exclusive sources agree:\n \n 5th June 1942, midday \n \n \"It is deplorable that the Bible should have been translated into German, and that the whole of the German people should have thus become exposed to the whole of this Jewish mumbo-jumbo. So long as the wisdom, particularly of the Old Testament, remained exclusively in the Latin of the Church, there was little danger that sensible people would become the victims of illusions as the result of studying the Bible. But since the Bible has become common property, a whole heap of people have found opened to them line of religious thought which-particularly in conjunction with the German characteristic of persistent and somewhat melancholy meditation-as often as not turned them into religious maniacs. When one recollects further that the Catholic Church has elevated to the status of Saints a whole number of madmen, one realizes why movements such as that of the Flagellants came inevitably into existence in the Middle Ages in Germany.\n \n As a sane German, one is flabbergasted to think that German human beings could have let themselves be brought to such a pass by Jewish filth and priestly twaddle, that they were little different from the howling dervish of the Turks and the negroes, at whom we laugh so scornfully. It angers one to think that, while in other parts of the globe religious teaching like that of Confucius, Buddha and Mohammed offers an undeniably broad basis for the religious-minded, Germans should have been duped by a theological exposition devoid of all honest depth.\"\n \n Adolph Hitler, Hitler's Table Talk, 1941-1944, His Private Conversations, 3nd.

   "I strongly disagree with the methods hitler employed. He was an extremist and maniac in himself, and is a good example of how dangerous extremism can become, whether the motivation is religious or secular. \n \n Sadly many christians and religious people in general equate atheism to anti-christianity. As an atheist I see no benefits in giving people the delusion of religious hope, religious esteem above the non-relgious, nor religious ownership of what people ought to think and do. I recognize that religion gives an emotional safe-haven to millions of people around the world who are otherwise projected upon by feelings of vulnerability and insecurity, mostly caused by the very religions they are running to. In fact, I strongly believe that the world would be a much better and safer place if religion was completely eradicated. But I also know enough to recognize that violence, genocide, wars and other forms of force do nothing to get rid of religion, but instead only give the religious more reasons to hold steadfastly to their beliefs, and the end result is usually more fervent religious growth, and more reactive religious extremism. \n \n I would comment on something in hitler's speech, particularly where he notes that the world cannot be bound by lies eternally. In general we don't have eternity to figure out the major deceptions that the world is under, and for most people they seem to either not be aware of the lies that affect everything they do, they are unaware how to change the way it affects them, or they simply don't care to change despite of being aware. \n \n Whether the words were really those of hitler or not doesn't really matter. Whether he was a christian or not doesn't matter either. Anyone who takes an extremist approach about anything they believe in is likely to become infamously dangerous to others.",

Many within the senior leadership in particular did not consider themselves so. Still, the point is well taken about his \"followers.\" Although \"following\" is a vague term, and as used here it could encompass a broad range from the die hard devotee-to those going with the flow while struggling to reconcile what they were doing with their conscience-to those who were blissfully ignorant of the atrocities being committed. I still like the thrust of this post, though. I think it forces us to consider the issue of those who knowingly went along with the program. \n \n In the end it matters not whether the issuance of our condemnation of Hitler and his actions flows from a religious or some other moral high seat. I trust that those of us here who consider themselves apostate regarding organized religion would still condemn Hitler.\n \n But we must all recognize that our virtue in this matter comes easily enough, for it has cost us nothing. Now let me ask the question the above post begs: \n \n Regardless of whether your belief in the \"wrongness\" of Nazism comes from religious or other grounds, if you were a German citizen living under Hitler, how vocal would you have been in your opposition to him and his methods? Or to put it another way, how willing would you have been to step up and become a martyr? \n \n Let's all be honest with ourselves now, for the question has moved beyond considering the strength of religion to the strength of human moral character in general. \n \n ---\n \n \"It was necessary for the Jew to appear on the scene and introduce the mad conception of a life that continues into an alleged beyond! It enables one to regard life as a thing that is negligible here below-since it will flourish later, when it no longer exists. Under cover of a religion, the Jew has introduced intolerance in a sphere in which tolerance formerly prevailed. Amongst the Romans, the cult of the sovereign intelligence was associated with the modesty of a humanity that knew its limits, to the point of consecrating altars to the unknown god.\n The Jew who fraudulently introduced Christianity in the ancient world-in order to ruin it-re-opened the same breach in modern times, this time taking as his pretext the social question. It's the same sleight of hand as before. Just as Saul was changed into St. Paul, Mardochai became Karl Marx.\"\n Adolph Hitler, Hitler's Table Talk, 1941-1944, His Private Conversations, 3nd.

   "I don't think the question of Hitler being Christianity is anywhere near as interesting as the fact that the German Christians FOLLOWED Hitler.\n\n \n Certainly not all of them. That's why there was a Christian resistance.\n \n I also think it's important to keep in mind that most of the populace was unaware of the genocide and atrocities going on. That's why they were shocked when the allies found what they did in the camps. What you're describing boils down to simply a tendency of people to trust their leaders. We do it here in America too and it's absolutely not limited to Christians, as it wasn't then either. It's sort of the same concept as when most Americans went along with the government putting Asian Americans in camps during WWII. No, it wasn't right, but pointing to just Christianity over this sort of thing is like picking one tree out of a whole forest. Hitler used numerous tactics to get people to go along with his nationalistic message (that most people DIDN'T know was genocidal). Yes, he deceived people.",

   "Just some more thoughts from the man-in this case emphasizing one of his grievances against the organized church stemmed from his belief that it was a rival for power: \n \n \"The great ambition of the parson clique is, and always has been, to undermine the power of the State. And for as long as we suffer these parsons in our midst, it serves us right! Every country gets the type of parson it deserves, at the moment I can do nothing about it, and so I continue to keep them happy. But one of these days I shall bring this conflict, as old as German history itself, to an abrupt and decisive conclusion. I'll make these damned parsons feel the power of the State in a way they would never have dreamed possible! For the moment I am just keeping my eye on them. If I ever have the slightest suspicion that they are getting dangerous, I will shoot the lot of them. This filthy reptile raises its head whenever there is a sign of weakness in the State, and therefore it must be stamped on whenever it does so. We have no sort of use for a fairy story invented by the Jews. The fate of a few filthy, lousy Jews and epileptics is not worth bothering about. The foulest of the carrion are those who come clothed in the cloak of humility, and the foulest of the foul is Count Preysing! What a beast! The Popish inquisitor is a humane being in comparison. Vileness and hypocrisy walk arm in arm; both must be extirpated. The uselessness of a parson is nowhere better illustrated than here at the front. Here we have enemies who are dying by the million-and without a single one of them liars.

   "You seem fond of using Table Talk, which was rejected as being accurate by the stenographers who were there.\n \n I wonder why that is?\n\n \n To answer your question:\n \n The \"Borman conspiracy\" claim suggests either of two possibilities: 1. The original notes included several discussions in which Hitler talked about Christianity in positive tones, which Borman fraudulently changed into anti-Christian viewpoints; or 2. Several talks occurred where the subject of Christianity never came up and Borman decided to create and include fraudulent anti-Christian thoughts. \n \n Both stenographers survived the war and have discussed the authenticity of the works. I have read what they have said about the accuracy of the recordings. During the back and forth of copyright lawsuits Picker complained that his publication (at least during the 4+ months he made the recordings) is more accurate. He produced testimonials from men who were present for the talks who swore the notes he took were accurate. As part of his copyright claim he complained that \"no faith\" can be placed in Borman's editing \"unauthorized by me\" of his original notes (found in the \"Frau Borman\" copy). These are the quotes of the stenographers most often relied upon by the \"Borman conspiracy\" partisans. Significantly, however, Picker's own publication of his copy of his notes (for which Borman had no ability to adulterate) contains the anti-Christian thoughts of Hitler, and Picker has never suggested Borman inserted anti-Christian themes in the competitor \"Frau Borman\" copy. \n \n Heinrich Heim has endorsed the \"Frau Borman\" copy as his. He has never suggested Borman or anyone else added anti-Christian thoughts to his notes. Heim has also seen Picker's publication, which included purloined copies of some of his original notes (Picker ultimately published some 36 entries for which he was not the stenographer but he obtained from copying Heim's notes). Heim's complaint against the Picker copies of his notes was not that he added to or took away anything from them, but that in some instances Picker edited them to read from 1st to 3rd person. \n \n Returning to the back and forth of copyright lawsuits for a moment....As a result of the competing claims raised in these lawsuits Picker in particular possessed a strong motive to produce any and all evidence that the \"Frau Borman\" notes were not genuine or had been altered in such a way as to show he had the only true originals of Hitler's private expressions (at least of his tenure). If Borman had added to or changed Hitler's expressions on Christianity, then Picker had every reason to use such an example to ague his competitor's copy was fraudulent. He made complaints about other issues, but he never did so regarding the content of the recorded anti-Christian thoughts. \n \n In sum, each of the two men responsible for taking down Hitler's expressions as accurately as possible has had more than one opportunity to review the published products. Neither man has ever suggested that Borman or anyone else inserted anti-Christian thoughts into their recordings of what Hitler said.\n \n Why is it so difficult to accept the reality that a ruthless politician would be two faced-that a man who surrounded himself with men who were hostile to organized religion would smile and say one thing in public to please the masses while privately holding a contrary view? \n \n I don't want people reading that I have said one thing and assume from it that I must be implying three or four other things as well. My agenda here is not to say \"Hitler is an atheist and you are just like him if you're an atheist too.\" I want to set up the fact that a man who disagreed with Christianity nevertheless recognized its symbolic value and used it as a tool to help rally a people behind him. Then I want to ask why was he so successfull at doing so. \n \n ---\n \n \"It's only in the realm of music that I can find no satisfaction. The same thing is happening to music as is happening to beauty in a world dominated by the shavelings-the Christian religion is an enemy to beauty. The Jew has brought off the same trick upon music. He has created a new inversion of values and replaced the loveliness of music by noises. Surely the Athenian, when he entered the Parthenon to contemplate the image of Zeus, must have had another impression that the Christian who must resign himself to contemplating the grimacing face of a man crucified.\n Since my fourteenth year I have felt liberated from the superstition that the priests used to teach. Apart from a few Holy Joes, I can say that none of my comrades went on believing in the miracle of the Eucharist.\n The only difference between then and now is that in those days I was convinced one must blow up the whole show with dynamite.\" \n Night conversation of 20-12 February, 1942. \n \n \"Once the war is over we will put a swift end to the Concordat. It will give me the greatest personal pleasure to point out to the Church all those occasions on which it has broken the terms of it. One need only recall the close co-operation between the church and the murderers of Heydrich. Catholic priests not only allowed them to hide in a church on the outskirts of Prague, but even allowed them to entrench themselves in the sanctuary of the altar.\"\n Dinner conversation of July 4, 1942.",

   "You know, I don't even have a problem with you saying he claimed to be a Christian. Hitler was also very patriotic; he used patriotism in his speeches a lot too to appeal to people. He surely used lots of things to appeal to people. What I want to know is, to what end are you saying that? Are you saying that Christianity is CAUSE for what he did? Because that's the real issue. What's your point here, other than just saying he had \"involvement with Christianity\" (which by itself really doesn't mean much)?\n\n \n I've been following this conversation. To me, it is utterly irrelevant whether Hitler was, himself, a Christian, an atheist (really unlikely) or some sort of Pagan. Who really cares what he was in his dark little heart? In his every public utterance; in everything he ever said or did; he claimed to be a Christian. He used Christianity, he used patriotism, to gain ultimate power. And he could use Christianity, because for centuries, as someone else has noted, Catholic and Lutheran Churches had inculcated in their Christian followers a vicious hatred of Jews and \"others,\" like Gypsies. Google up Hitler and Oberammergau. Google up Luther and Jews. \n \n Better yet, google up Jebwabne, Poland. It wasn't Hitler that rounded up those 11 million people - 6 million of them Jews - and shoved them into the boxcars. It was the good \"Christian\" people of Germany, of Poland, of Russia, of France. Please read the story of Jebwabne, especially. It tells a terrible story of human weakness. \n \n But this is not an indictment of Christianity in particular, or religion in general. It is a statement about human weakness. Read also the story of Denmark: \n \n \"It's one of the great untold stories of World War II: In 1943, in German-occupied Denmark, the Danish people found out that all 7,500 Danish Jews were about to be rounded up and deported to German concentration camps. Danish citizens spontaneously make their own decision: it's not going to happen. And it didn't. Risking their own lives, the Danes quickly rallied round to save their fellow citizens, and almost all of the country's Jews were able to escape the clutches of the Nazis and find refuge in neutral Sweden.\"\n \n I don't think that religion makes us better; I don't think that religion makes us worse.

Being 'rich' is a relative concept. What is 'rich' in one part of the world may not be rich in another. For instance, you yourself might basically be a rich man in a number of African 3rd world countries; but you prepared to give up that 'being rich' because you believe Christ wants you to? There are some who would be 'rich' in any culture, but why should we assume that's the only type of 'being rich' Jesus was referring to?\n \n Opposing greed and corruption in the world is a worthwhile thing to do, but if we're not careful we can find ourselves becoming far more condemning than Jesus ever was by basically purporting a view of Rich=Evil, which Jesus didn't espouse.

Studies of so called monogamous species have found that both sexes will cheat with an attractive mate if given the opportunity. \n\n \n I have read that. There are some interesting studies, especially re birds, of species previously thought to be monogamous sexually, who actually fool around quite a bit - although they do form monogamous bonds to raise young. But the forming of those bonds is likely genetically driven. Some species form monogamous pair bonds; some don't. \n \n \n \n As for religion, it is a cultural thing, passed on because of fear of the unknown.

Of course, we may have a definitional problem here; morality often gets all balled up with religious belief in supernatural nonsense. Belief in invisible beings and miracles would be less likely to have a genetic basis; there are oriental religions that don't do gods. Have you read any of the recent sociobiology stuff on the subject? Jonathan Haidt is really good on it. Here's a good, long, recent article by him:\n \n http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/haidt07/haidt07_index.html\n \n Some snippets:\n \n [I]n the 1990s two books were published that I believe triggered an explosion of cross-disciplinary scientific interest in morality, out of which has come a new synthesis-very much along the lines that E. O. Wilson predicted in 1975. \n \n The first was Antonio Damasio's Descartes' Error, in 1994, which showed a very broad audience that morality could be studied using the then new technology of fMRI, and also that morality, and rationality itself, were crucially dependent on the proper functioning of emotional circuits in the prefrontal cortex. The second was Frans de Waal's Good Natured, published just two years later, which showed an equally broad audience that the building blocks of human morality are found in other apes and are products of natural selection in the highly social primate lineage. These two books came out just as John Bargh was showing social psychologists that automatic and unconscious processes can and probably do cause the majority of our behaviors, even morally loaded actions (like rudeness or altruism) that we thought we were controlling consciously. \n \n Furthermore, Damasio and Bargh both found, as Michael Gazzaniga had years before, that people couldn't stop themselves from making up post-hoc explanations for whatever it was they had just done for unconscious reasons. Combine these developments and suddenly Kohlbergian moral psychology seemed to be studying the wagging tail, rather than the dog. If the building blocks of morality were shaped by natural selection long before language arose, and if those evolved structures work largely by giving us feelings that shape our behavior automatically, then why should we be focusing on the verbal reasons that people give to explain their judgments in hypothetical moral dilemmas?",

Let's take a look at a a few other things shall we? Keep in mind the commentaries at the bottom.\n \n 19:23-30 Though Christ spoke so strongly, few that have riches do not trust in them. How few that are poor are not tempted to envy! But men's earnestness in this matter is like their toiling to build a high wall to shut themselves and their children out of heaven. It should be satisfaction to those who are in a low condition, that they are not exposed to the temptations of a high and prosperous condition. If they live more hardly in this world than the rich, yet, if they get more easily to a better world, they have no reason to complain. Christ's words show that it is hard for a rich man to be a good Christian, and to be saved. The way to heaven is a narrow way to all, and the gate that leads into it, a strait gate; particularly so to rich people. More duties are expected from them than from others, and more sins easily beset them. It is hard not to be charmed with a smiling world. Rich people have a great account to make up for their opportunities above others. It is utterly impossible for a man that sets his heart upon his riches, to get to heaven. Christ used an expression, denoting a difficulty altogether unconquerable by the power of man. Nothing less than the almighty grace of God will enable a rich man to get over this difficulty. Who then can be saved? If riches hinder rich people, are not pride and sinful lusts found in those not rich, and as dangerous to them? Who can be saved? say the disciples. None, saith Christ, by any created power. The beginning, progress, and perfecting the work of salvation, depend wholly on the almighty power of God, to which all things are possible. Not that rich people can be saved in their worldliness, but that they should be saved from it. Peter said, We have forsaken all. Alas! it was but a poor all, only a few boats and nets; yet observe how Peter speaks, as if it had been some mighty thing. We are too apt to make the most of our services and sufferings, our expenses and losses, for Christ. However, Christ does not upbraid them; though it was but little that they had forsaken, yet it was their all, and as dear to them as if it had been more. Christ took it kindly that they left it to follow him; he accepts according to what a man hath. Our Lord's promise to the apostles is, that when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory, he will make all things new, and they shall sit with him in judgement on those who will be judged according to their doctrine. This sets forth the honour, dignity, and authority of their office and ministry. Our Lord added, that every one who had forsaken possessions or comforts, for his sake and the gospel, would be recompensed at last. May God give us faith to rest our hope on this his promise; then we shall be ready for every service or sacrifice. Our Saviour, in the last verse, does away a mistake of some. The heavenly inheritance is not given as earthly ones are, but according to God's pleasure. Let us not trust in promising appearances or outward profession. Others may, for aught we know, become eminent in faith and holiness.\n \n \n Isn't it also written that \n \n I'm also wondering why the left-wing atheists condemn CEOs out of jealousy, but attack Jesus for essentially agreeing with them. Not to say that Jesus believed this, just pointing out your lack of logic.\n \n \nThe only problem is that it is YOU who is trying to change words in the ACTUAL translation, just cause you find it convenient. emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n Once again, you're gawking at the bueaty of the tip of the iceberg. You don't see anything beneath the surface (or more accurately, you don't want to because it doens't support you.).\n \n I explained that the King Jimmy is wrong. But you omitted it because youhad no argument for it. I know you'll pull that trick again, but I'll repeat it below anyhow. \n \n List of things Foundit omitted:\n \n \n \n Exodus 26:14 - And thou shalt make a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering above of badgers' skins.\n \n As you can see, the King Jimmy's innaccuracy is the bread and butter of the bible-contradictions screamers.

Because I can safely assume that you're a rich man compared to many of the poor in the world. And are you seriously prepared to say that people shouldn't save up anything for retirement at all? More importantly, are you seriously ready to tell the poor to not save any money if they get a chance, knowing it would help them? Jesus was talking about doing things that are heavenly as opposed to worldly priorities. That's why the next statement was 'but lay for yourselves treasures in HEAVEN.' It was a teaching about peoples' priorities being wrong. Anyone with the least bit reasonable approach is going to get what Jesus is getting at here. The irony here is that by taking Jesus' statements as law-like commands the way you're doing it, you're taking the same sort of approach as the very pharisees that Jesus often took a stand against. Jesus was trying to teach compassion and having compassionate priorities rather than self-centered ones when it came to money.\n \n \nWhat I find astonishing is that some Christians have managed to convince themselves that it is right and proper to take a hyper-literal interpretation of any passage that can be construed to be about sexuality\n\n \n Yes, SOME Christians do that. The thing is, you're doing here what THEY'RE doing. So now I know you understand the concept I'm talking about. You're doing the same thing with this issue we're discussing that some Christians do with the issue of sexuality.",

In order to support capitalism you have to not only interpret Christ's words you have to completely disregard them. You can split hairs all you want about what defines rich and poor (I'm aware I have a better standard of living than most people in the world but I don't have any disposable income to speak of because the cost of living here is so high, and I don't have savings either), but that doesn't actually address the issue of whether it's ok to be rich.",

Capitalism is a complicated thing. There are degrees of it, and there are aspects of it that can be good or bad, just like many things, and there is the whole issue of regulated capitalism. The problem is that suppressing capitalism altogether takes away peoples' freedom. Selling something to try and make any profit at all to feed one's family is a form of capitalism. We quite simply don't live in a utopian society where governments can be trusted for everything. I think it's a wrong approach to just make a blanket sweeping statement that capitalism = bad. It's just like many other things: it has the potential to be a good thing and it has the potential to be a bad thing. You seem to have the idea that Jesus is basically against the idea of any market. That's what being against capitalism in any way means. That you're against selling something for a profit, even if making a profit from it is necessary for one's well-being. Because suppressing capitalism takes away peoples' individual freedoms, it becomes ANTI-Christian to do that. \n \n Capitalism is basically a default state of human behavior in any culture that doesn't suppress people trying to better themselves in any way or rely on a government for all their well-being. It's not an issue of needing to support it from Jesus' statements; it doesn't need to be argued FOR--commerce is a standard benign element of humans working with ea. other and interacting, after all. The issue is that people such as yourself feel that it shouldn't exist because of Jesus' statements; IOW, you're arguing against capitalism altogether. To me, that is taking Jesus' teaching to a rather legalistic level that. If you were arguing only against BAD forms of capitalism, I could more easily agree with you, but you haven't placed that limit on your arguments thus far.",

What I find astonishing is that some Christians have managed to convince themselves that it is right and proper to take a hyper-literal interpretation of any passage that can be construed to be about sexuality, then when it come to practical, day to day issues of how people live, how they relate to other people both economically and socially, they're all about nuance and the words behind the words and specious \"context\", all the while claiming to still be \"sola scriptura\".

The crusaders outsourced their penance by paying lots of money to the monastaries to do it for them( they were all Catholics in those days) If you think that will work, good luck to you !\n There are many cases in history where rich men gave away thier wealth to God, including some of the disciples, why should a rich man today keep his!\n i dont know the answer but the problem is quite clear!",

   "4It's funny to watch these debates about what a true christian should believe about money and the rich. None of you have expressed the view of the largest (i.e., most attended) church in the U.S., Lakewood Church in Houston Texas. Attendance averages above 30,000 every Sunday, and that doesn't count the television audience or those who enrich the pastor by buying his books. Of course, they conduct services in the arena formerly known as the Summit, and then the Compaq Center, where the Houston Rockets, Houston Comets, and Houston Aeros used to play. When the sports teams moved to the new, downtown facility, the Toyota Center, the Summit/Compaq Center was sold to the Lakewood Church.\n \n When you visit the Lakewood Church, the first thing you will notice is that the concession area around the arena that used to be devoted to the sale of hot dogs, nachos, popcorn, soft drinks and pizza, and team souvenirs is now dedicated to the sale of religious paraphernalia, most especially, books by the pastor, Joel Osteen.\n \n Lakewood Church was founded by John Osteen, an ordained Southern Baptist minister who became charismatic in the late 1950's. When he died of a heart attack in 1999, John's son Joel, who had been the producer of the church's television ministry, became pastor. Joel had a single year of college and has no divinity degree of any kind. And yet, he is the pastor of the largest christian church in the world, some 5 times larger than the church founded by his father.\n \n His message is that his god rewards the saved. That is why Joel Osteen is a multiple millionaire. Osteen's god shows his favor with wealth.\n \n The American people are such dumb fracks!

How few that are poor are not tempted to envy! But men's earnestness in this matter is like their toiling to build a high wall to shut themselves and their children out of heaven. It should be satisfaction to those who are in a low condition, that they are not exposed to the temptations of a high and prosperous condition. If they live more hardly in this world than the rich, yet, if they get more easily to a better world, they have no reason to complain. Christ's words show that it is hard for a rich man to be a good Christian, and to be saved. The way to heaven is a narrow way to all, and the gate that leads into it, a strait gate; particularly so to rich people. More duties are expected from them than from others, and more sins easily beset them. It is hard not to be charmed with a smiling world. Rich people have a great account to make up for their opportunities above others. It is utterly impossible for a man that sets his heart upon his riches, to get to heaven. Christ used an expression, denoting a difficulty altogether unconquerable by the power of man. Nothing less than the almighty grace of God will enable a rich man to get over this difficulty. Who then can be saved? If riches hinder rich people, are not pride and sinful lusts found in those not rich, and as dangerous to them? Who can be saved? say the disciples. None, saith Christ, by any created power. The beginning, progress, and perfecting the work of salvation, depend wholly on the almighty power of God, to which all things are possible. Not that rich people can be saved in their worldliness, but that they should be saved from it. Peter said, We have forsaken all. Alas! it was but a poor all, only a few boats and nets; yet observe how Peter speaks, as if it had been some mighty thing. We are too apt to make the most of our services and sufferings, our expenses and losses, for Christ. However, Christ does not upbraid them; though it was but little that they had forsaken, yet it was their all, and as dear to them as if it had been more. Christ took it kindly that they left it to follow him; he accepts according to what a man hath. Our Lord's promise to the apostles is, that when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory, he will make all things new, and they shall sit with him in judgement on those who will be judged according to their doctrine. This sets forth the honour, dignity, and authority of their office and ministry. Our Lord added, that every one who had forsaken possessions or comforts, for his sake and the gospel, would be recompensed at last. May God give us faith to rest our hope on this his promise; then we shall be ready for every service or sacrifice. Our Saviour, in the last verse, does away a mistake of some. The heavenly inheritance is not given as earthly ones are, but according to God's pleasure. Let us not trust in promising appearances or outward profession. Others may, for aught we know, become eminent in faith and holiness.\n\n \n Man. You quote a LOT without even bothering to THINK about what it says.\n I highlighted the portions you need to REALLY look at.\n You're trying to bury the facts in a snow storm of pointless blah, blah, blah...\n \n Jesus TELLS PEOPLE HOW TO ACT.\n Quite frankly, if YOU thought about how Jesus tells people to act, you should realize that a man who hordes money doesn't care what Jesus says.\n \n A rich man who lives high on the hog, while allowing his fellow man to suffer in poverty or hunger or sickness, IS NOT CHRISTIAN.\n I realize you probably haven't a clue, but have you ever heard the Bible passages about God picking people out on the last day, and telling one group that they \"saw him\" when he was sick and helped him?\n There is so much in your bible that you close your eyes to cause you only want to use it for your purposes.\n NOT your biblical god's...\n \n \n \nI'm also wondering why the left-wing atheists condemn CEOs out of jealousy, but attack Jesus for essentially agreeing with them. Not to say that Jesus believed this, just pointing out your lack of logic.\n\n Where did I \"attack Jesus for essentially agreeing with\" me????\n I didn't.\n Another dumb strawman argument of yours.\n Why can't you be troubled to tell the truth???\n \n \n \nI explained that the King Jimmy is wrong.\n\n I can give you ten other bible translations all saying the same thing.\n But at this stage, that's not even important cause you just keep parrotting \"King Jimmy is wrong\" ad nausieum without a clue as to what you're trying to apply it to.\n \n \n \nList of things Foundit omitted:\n\n All of them, non-topical.\n Point me to the post of yours I didn't address IN THE ORIGINAL THREAD and I'll bring it up there.\n The fact that you CONTINUE to refuse to do that points to only one thing.\n You WANT TO SIDE-TRACK THIS THREAD...",
