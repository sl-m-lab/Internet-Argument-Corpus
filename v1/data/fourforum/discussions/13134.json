I wouldn't want to buy a phone that is limited to one service provider and is still working on implementing simple functions, like copy and paste and picture texting.\n\n \n I don't know what you're talking about regarding price. I paid only 199.00 for the 16 gig 3G S. And as for being tied to one service provider, it seems that all of the carriers make exclusive deals now with the newest phones. The Palm Pre being just one example. And what do you mean they are still working on implementing copy and paste and picture texting? Those functions work just fine on my phone. Watch the video I posted and you'll see how it's done. It's a tutorial on all of its functions.\n \n \nWhen you buy a Mac, you pay for the name. Maybe that's cool for impressionable art students and graphic designers, but I have no issues with the photo / video editing and music recording capabilities of my PC.\n\n \n What I find most convenient is the simplicity with which it syncs to my macbook. And since I understand the one, the features of the other are a piece of cake to implement. And I didn't buy it for the name at all but for the function of it. Just as my macbook has never needed any anti-virus software in order to keep it safe from hackers, this phone has features no other phone can duplicate with such ease and simplicity. \n \n \nThe IPhone is not a great phone, but what makes it a great device over all other mobiles is the App Store. \n \n Arch, have you bought any apps yet?\n\n \n Here's what I mean about the ease and simplicity which the apps contribute to the practicality and convenience of the phone. One app I got is the google voice search, which allows you to speak the search term rather than type it using the miniature keyboard. Even though the keyboard expands, it's easier than typing it in.\n \n I also got the Pandora app which takes one song you choose and directs you to a complete library of similar songs. So you can have different categories within it of different genres of music all in the same place, for free and anywhere you are inclined to listen.\n \n My next favorite app is the iheartradio which allows me to choose my favorites so I can always listen to my favorite talk radio venues as clearly as if its satellite radio.\n \n And speaking of satellite radio, I also downloaded the sirius xm app but I haven't seen the need to use it yet. Also, the flashlight app is just really neat in that it acts as a night light when you go to the bathroom @ 3AM. No lights needed anymore emoticon_smile \n \n It also has stupid apps like the Zippo lighter which has a flickering flame when you blow on it. It's a great illusion. For games I have downloaded Deerhunter which is a lot of fun with incredible graphics, and Chess which I can play with friends. There are more and thousands more to choose from. There's pretty much an app for anything you could want. The flexibility and versatility that affords the user adds a lot of value to the iphone over the more conventional smart phones. I never got the practical usage from my Blackberry that I am getting from this phone.\n \n And I haven't even talked about the high speed internet access via the 3G network. And the new S version has speed capabilities which AT&Ts 3G service can't keep up with. So as someone who isn't a high tech geek by any means, this is a most impressive little tool. What I like most about it is that with new apps, it never gets boring or out dated. And with 16 gigs of memory it will be hard to fill up.\n \n I have downloaded 150 photos, my complete I tunes library, videos of TV shows, movies and most of the bible in sermon by Chuck Smith teaching almost the whole bible chapter by chapter. Each chapter being approximately a 1 hour sermon. With all of that, I still have 10 gigs left. And of course when I decide I no longer want the videos I currently have on it, I will just de-sync them back to my itunes library and download new ones.",

For the sake of this thread though, the key element the Cowen lacks is a CELL PHONE. And its 8 gig player costs as much as my 16 gig phone which also does video and MP3. So I just don't see the value you see in it. Especially since the geek who tested it disagrees with you regarding its sound quality and feature benefits. Here are some highlights from the review @ PC Magazine.\n There is little sense in arguing which is the better player, the iPod touch or Cowon's latest offering, the S9 (8GB, $199.99 list; 16GB, $239.99). Simply put, the S9 lacks the basic grace of the touch, as well as some other enticing features, Wi-Fi for one. This player might appeal to those who aren't crazy about Apple or willing to shell out the extra cash for a touch. But is the slim, touch screen&#8211;based S9&#8212;iPhone-esque accelerometer and all&#8212;worth its price tag? It certainly has its strengths, like excellent file support and recording for FM, voice, and line-in audio. Still, operation can be a bear, and there's no Web access.\n \n My main issue with the default UI is its unnecessary complexity. Getting to a song list or even deciphering each screen's symbols takes a little practice. Many of the features, such as rating a song or accessing the EQ controls, would be more easily accessible as text in simple pull-down menus instead of as vague images. Even worse, the most frustrating aspect of menu navigation is the touch screen's sensitivity; some of the icons are very small and require several taps to respond.\n \n The audio quality (once you replace those earbuds, of course) isn't bad. There are four different user-customizable EQs in addition to the standard settings, like Pop and Dance. The EQs are rather intense, with five adjustable bands; you can change the frequency, bandwidth, and level for each band. Of course, there's always the option to leave it all off and listen to things flat&#8212;the setting I prefer.\n \n Adjusting the EQ while listening to music presents a problem that occurs occasionally in other menus, too: The Volume controls at the top of the player become Plus and Minus buttons for parameters other than volume. In other words, if you're playing with the EQ and decide the music you're listening to is too loud, you have to navigate out of that screen to adjust the volume. Similarly, the Play/Pause button doesn't work when you're not on the Now Playing screen&#8212;even though it's a physical button that serves no other purpose. Design issues like these add extra steps to basic navigation, which isn't a good thing.\n \n At first glance, the S9 looks like a winner, but I was turned off by hardware buttons that don't always work when they should and a touch screen that isn't quite sensitive enough. These aren't bugs or malfunctions, they're simply confusing design choices. Even if the S9 didn't have these shortcomings, however, it lacks Web connectivity. That maybe okay for now, but very soon, consumers will start expecting Wi-Fi on devices with large touch screens like this. Sony's upcoming Walkman will feature wireless capabilities&#8212;and at this point, the iPod touch isn't exactly new. If Cowon wants to compete with these players, it needs to add Wi-Fi support&#8212;and create a user interface that behaves as nicely as it looks.How to Buy an MP3 Player - Cowon S9 - Full Review - Reviews by PC Magazine\n \n This link offers a comparison between your player and the ipod touch, and the ipod is the editors choice in this review.\n \n Compare MP3 Players at PC Magazine\n \n Do we have any reason to believe that PC Magazine is unfairly prejudiced against Cowen?

   "You needn't prefer their version of a cell phone, but I'm just surprised that you see it as some type of poser or interloper when it is the fastest selling phone on the market. And apple also garners the most interest and excitement in the hi tech market place also.\n \n\n \n The thing that gets me is of course the marketing of Apple. Instead of it being open source apps or free apps in most of their features it require you to pay for these features. I'm not saying that creators of the apps shouldn't get paid but it just seems like another big black hole off Apples that you can throw your money into.\n \n And as far as garnering interest I disagree. Typical people who have no clear knowledge of the workings behind the technology they use maybe. But to the tech savvy person, or ones who actually understand the workings behind such devices, it is much more diverse.\n \n I say this because Apple is definably not the standard in audio quality of PMP devices by any means. The lack of true lossless format support with a medicore software that you MUST use along with a MUST use audio format, just constricts what potential the device ever had and turns it into a vaccumn for profit. \n \n An example of audio quality is this. When an original track is mixed in a studio, it is saved in a format known as .WAV. .WaV is the biggest file size with no audio compression. However, for most PMP devices or even cd's each track could easily exceed 100 megabytes, thus it is not viable. \n \n However, another type of file format is FLAC. Now FLAC is a compressed format of .WAV. The only major difference is that within the compression format, you lose NO quality. None whatsoever. A typical song runs about 25 megabytes to 30 depending on length. A Huge improvement on file size while keeping the original unspoiled quality of a song intact.\n \n The next formats of course are other compressions such as WMA MP3 OGG and the imfamous AAC format that Itunes converts your tracks into so an Ipod can read them.\n \n Now just think in terms of quality. A FLAC file retaining every single bit of information of an original track is 30 megabytes. An AAC file compresses that and loses a majority of that file to a very small 3 megabytes. That means that the track you are listening to is 10 times less in quality than a FLAC file at a compression level of 5 out of 10.\n \n This is why I cannot stand the Ipods audio \"quality\". It takes an original track that has been professionally mixed and balanced and strips it of all but its very basic sound bytes and EQ's, thus destroying any quality. People ask me well can you hear the difference?\n \n The answer is yes!! Out of all the PMP devices on the market the only two manufacturers that support FLAC let alone WAV support playback on their devices is Cowon and Iriver. A perfect example of this is I was in Best Buy about 3 weeks ago with my friend browsing.\n \n One of the managers in the PMP department came by and was speaking to my friend and telling him about some new releases of upcoming devices etc. Well needless to say I let her listen to my Cowon s9 with my tracks in full FLAC format with my Sony MDR XB500 headphones (which they do sell at best buy) and was blown away. \n \n So to say that Apple garners the most interest and excitement among high tech savvy users is not true in the least. For the definitive tech buyer they will look for innovation. Not an application on a screen that makes a flame pop up or a flashlight.",

   "Good luck with that choice. For the sake of this thread though, the key element the Cowen lacks is a CELL PHONE. And its 8 gig player costs as much as my 16 gig phone which also does video and MP3. So I just don't see the value you see in it. Especially since the geek who tested it disagrees with you regarding its sound quality and feature benefits. Here are some highlights from the review.\n \n Do we have any reason to believe that PC Magazine is unfairly prejudiced against Cowen? I think not.\n\n \n \n I agree. I have talked with other Cowon owners and we would love to see the same quality made into a phone. But Cowon's speciality is PMP audio devices Archie. As far as the review by the editor of PC magazine, I disagree fully. The UI issues with the player were adressed fully with the newest firmware release. If you want another review Here is another I will post a link to. And as far as seeing the quality, sorry i've compared the Ipod the TOuch and just about every other player in quality to this one and make no mistake, it blows them all out of the water.\n \n And unlike other people I am willing to pay for that quality. \n \n Watch this video on an unbiased review fully.

Now instead of these games just sitting on my hard drive I can try and release them on the iPhone.\n \n \nAlthough it's hard getting an app accepted due to stringent requirements, once you do, it's said to be very profitable.
