He is what they believe it to be. He is what they hope it will be. And he is what they hope it will always be. Maureen O'hara\n\n John Wayne was not very much the brave soldier. Of course, he pretended to be the brave soldier in a number of war films -- and that all that BKS01 needs for his little fantasy world about right wingers:\n \nWayne did not serve during World War II, unlike many of his peers including William Holden, James Stewart, Clark Gable, Tyrone Power, and Henry Fonda. This has long been controversial, especially in light of his right-wing political views and his unwavering support for the Vietnam War, and has led to accusations that he was a draft dodger. \n \n Wayne was throughout his career a very vocal supporter of the military, anti-Communism and the Republican Party. During the Vietnam War he criticized young men who went to Canada and Europe to dodge the draft, calling them cowards, and strongly criticized Jane Fonda and Donald Sutherland for their anti-war activism. \n \n Wayne was 34 years old when the United States entered World War II, and requested a deferment as a married father of four children. It is notable that numerous other married celebrities with children, like the 37-year-old activist liberal Democrat Henry Fonda, did serve with distinction throughout the conflict. According to a recent biography of director John Ford, Wayne was worried that his serving in the military would endanger his career in Hollywood. Ford would frequently attack him for his failure to enlist, calling him a coward and comparing him unfavorably with actors who did not disobey the draft, such as Stewart. \n \n On one occasion while visiting US combat troops, Wayne was rumored to have been booed off the stage. Author Gore Vidal recalled many of his comrades would laugh at Wayne's pro-war movies like Back to Bataan (1945) and They Were Expendable (1945) (though how troops during the war could have seen the latter, which was not released until sometime after the war, Vidal does not explain). In one of his books, he nicknamed Wayne \"The Great Draft Dodger\". \n \n Many believe Wayne's embarrassment over this issue caused him to assume the position of a super-hawk in later life. He directed and starred in The Green Berets (1968), the only movie ever made to blatantly support the Vietnam War. He later financed a documentary using his own money, No Substitute for Victory (1970), which alleged the United States was losing the Cold War due to a lack of willingness to fight.\n\n John Wayne (I) - Biography\n \n Truth is always very interesting.",

They weren't exactly rich, but they got richer. They also got more stupid. When William Beveridge laid out his blueprint for the modern British welfare state in 1942, his goal was the \"abolition of want.\" Sir William and his colleagues on both sides of the Atlantic succeeded beyond their wildest dreams: to be \"poor\" in the 21st-century West is not to be hungry and emaciated but to be obese, with your kids suffering from childhood diabetes. When Michelle Obama turned up to serve food at a soup kitchen, its poverty-stricken clientele snapped pictures of her with their cellphones. In one-sixth of British households, not a single family member works. They are not so much without employment as without need of it. At a certain level, your hard-working bourgeois understands that the bulk of his contribution to the treasury is entirely wasted. It's one of the basic rules of life: if you reward bad behaviour, you get more of it. But, in good and good-ish times, who cares?'\n \n What he doesnt say is that many middle class 'professionals' make a living by perpetuating this situation..but hell he probably didnt have the room.\n Anyway, within a year these 'non jobs' will be fighting with the poles to get a wage that they actually earn...I can only hopeemoticon_xbouncer",

I didn't think he was going to be a great President, but of the choices offered I thought he would be better. Running on smaller government, less taxes and less restrictive policies so did many other Americans. Boy did we get suckered. \n \n For all his faults Clinton left the nation in a much better condition than when he came in. As a matter of fact over the last 30 years it has been the right who are responsible for massive budget deficits and unprecedented growth of government, in terms of budget, power and overall size. Clinton cheated on his wife, lied about it, fired travel agents and made some money on some land he should not have. He also kept the country safe, prosperous and positive about the future. Reagan, Bush and Bush never cheated on their wives, but are mixed on the rest. Selling weapons to Iran in sideways deals and then lying about it, running up the largest budget deficits in the shortest amount of time since FDR and crushing the spirit of the country lead me to believe they should have cheated on their wives.\n \n Poor BP. Yes it's where they had to drill is the reason all that oil is washing up on shore. If that is the case maybe they should not have been drilling. Maybe they should not have said they could when they couldn't, maybe they should have spent the 500k from their 63 million a day revenue for the better equipment. Sorry I don't have sympathy for BP. They screwed themselves all by themselves.\n \n So what has the Left done to be thought of as stupid compared to the Right other than being Left. The author seems content to blame Obama for not being able to snap his fingers and turn around the economic nightmare Bush handed him, placing responsibility on the Left and making it representative of all people on the Left. \n \n You seem content to play the part of a good sheeple trolling for arguments without merit or substance. If you and shooter can't play nice then don't play in the same sandbox. If you would let go of the bitterness you carry around maybe you could not spend a page worth of posts crying about how you got ganged up on elsewhere. Attacking an ideology with this pathetic nonsense will not help your self esteem any. The Left has a number of problems that make it far from perfect.
