   "1. Please tell us more about your notion of \"full sovereignty\" for Iraq. Will this be like our returning Okinawan \"sovereignty\" to Japan in 1972, when we retained exclusive control over the 38 military bases on the island and the deployment and behavior of American forces on them?\n \n 2. Please tell us: If we plan to return Iraq to the Iraqis, why is the U.S. currently building fourteen permanent bases there?\n \n 3. Presumably the American troops to be stationed on these bases will remain under the control of the Pentagon and beyond the legal reach of any \"sovereign\" Iraqi state. Such arrangements are usually covered by a \"Status of Forces Agreement\" (SOFA) that we normally impose on the government in whose territory our bases are placed. Who will sign the SOFA on the Iraqi side? What are its terms? Will it be binding on the new government you hope the Iraqis will elect early next year?\n \n 4. The sovereignty discussion has been focused mainly on the question of who will control the actions of what troops -- Iraqi or American -- in the coming months. But American advisers will be stationed in every Iraqi \"ministry\"; the new government will evidently be capable neither of passing nor abrogating laws or regulations laid down by the occupying power (America); and the economy, except for oil, will remain open to all foreign corporate investors. Please tell us if this really strikes you as \"full sovereignty\"?\n \n 5. You say that we will tear down Abu Ghraib prison if the Iraqis so wish. What if they wish to preserve it as a monument to our cruelty as well as Saddam Hussein's?\n \n 6. Your administration has recently confirmed that while captured Taliban and al-Qaeda fighters were not, in your eyes, covered by the Geneva Conventions, Iraqi prisoners and detainees were. The acts in Abu Ghraib prison contravened those conventions. We now know that teams of interrogation experts were sent by Maj. Gen. Geoffrey D. Miller, commandant of our Guantanamo prison from Cuba to Abu Ghraib to teach Americans working there \"better\" interrogation techniques. If these contravened the Geneva Conventions, should General Miller be brought to trial for this? If General Miller acted at Guantanamo and elsewhere on the basis of guidelines and urgings from his superiors in the Pentagon and the military chain of command, should they face the same? Your views on this would be appreciated.\n \n 7. If it turns out to be true that some of the acts of torture in Abu Ghraib prison were, in fact, committed by members of the Israeli intelligence services, who were placed in the prison via our independent contractors, does this not further confuse American policy in the Middle East with that of Ariel Sharon's Israel? Is this really a good idea?\n \n 8. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the war and occupation in Iraq by 130,000 U.S. troops now costs close to $5 billion per month, or $60 billion a year. So far the war has cost American taxpayers $186 billion in direct military expenses. You've asked for another $425 billion in defense appropriations for the 2005 Pentagon budget, plus another $75 billion for Iraq, $25 billion for the development of new generations of nuclear weapons, and untold billion for such things as military pensions and veterans' health care. Not included in these figures are the multibillions in secret amounts spent on the CIA and other intelligence activities, not to speak of other Department of Defense \"black budget\" activities kept out of the appropriations process. Where is all this money going to come from? Why is our government putting all this money on the tab for future generations to deal with?\n \n 9. Speaking of military pensions and health care, would you please address the fact that something like 30% of the troops who participated in the first Gulf War are now seeking disability payments for illnesses contracted there -- chiefly as a result of our use of depleted uranium shells. Would you please discuss some of these long-term dangers of modern warfare (even when our initial short-term casualties seem relatively modest)? How will our military hospitals be able to care for all the soldiers who are likely to develop cancer or give birth to children with birth defects as a result of the current war?\n \n 10. On June 1, 2002, in your West Point speech enunciating your new doctrine of preventive war, you said there were 60 countries that were potential targets for regime change. Would you please list those 60 countries for us, and are you still determined in a second term to proceed down this list?\n \n 11. If you are determined to start new wars, or if the Iraq war drags on and not enough soldiers re-enlist, will you reinstate the draft?\n \n 12. Why do you usually give your speeches to the American people before audiences of servicemen and women at military academies, on bases, and the like, where they have been ordered by their superiors to attend and to applaud? Why not give one of your speeches -- especially if you're going to propose reinstating the draft -- at a large state college?\n \n \n Source:\n \n http://www.rense.com/general53/twel.htm",

   "IMO, answers to those 12 questions aren't available simply because the current administration considers 90 days long range planning. \n \n America, not just our leaders, is in the grip of megalomania driven by Christian righteousness and special interests, rationalized by waving our flag over anything deemed to be in the way of converting the world to our way of thinking. The end justifies the means has been the root philosophy of every political ideology using intimidation and force to achieve their goals since the beginning of time. \n \n As to Bush announcing the draft on a major college campus, since over 50% of the students there are on the federal loan tit I don't think it would cause much excitement. He'd probably preface such an announcement with federal forgiveness of student loans for any draftee. Kent State and past examples of student individuality are history. Most Americans have evolved to a point where they expect the federal government to take care of them and do their thinking for them. A little flag waving seems to make them eager to die for their government regardless of the senselessness of any cause. Lemmings come to mind.",

   "A typical liberal slant on things.\n \n I'm not speaking for Dubya, and I can't answer all of the questions. I question some of the statistics and claims contained in the questions, but...\n \n 1. The Iraqis may (and probably do) want us to stay there for a while.\n \n 2. The bases will likely be turned over to the Iraqis. (The Germans built bases in Poland with no intent of turning them over to the Pols, but now the Pols own them. Nothing lasts forever.)\n \n 5,6,7. Just can't get away from the Abu Ghraib scandal, can you? That wasn't torture we did. I've heard of lots worse things being done at fraternity hazings. Torture is what Saddam Hussein did...cutting off body parts, raping women, killing people. Liberals seem to redefine terms to suit their arguments. Why don't you mention the decapitation of the American captive? Why don't you mention the mass graves? Why don't you mention the tortured Iraqis who met with Bush recently? Why don't you mention the good things that have been said by Iraqis about the results of the war?\n \n Oh, I know. The media hasn't mentioned it to you. Those aren't good liberal talking points.\n \n 8. The economy is improving, just like it did when Reagan took over from that idiot, Jimmy Carter. We're in the greatest economic growth period in nearly 20 years. I don't agree with all of GWB's spending habits, but we certainly don't need the Democrats to come along and raise taxes (their \"solution\" to increase government revenue) and screw the economy again. Are you aware that under the Reagan tax cuts the government revenue increased dramatically? Are you aware that the total net worth of the US more than doubled in just 8 years under Reaganomics?\n \n 9. More money should be spent on military veterans.\n \n 10. Just to say that a regime change is needed doesn't mean we're going to instigate one. I think Castro should have been deposed a long time ago, but there's no need to invade the country. Sanctions appear to be quite effective. He will eventually fall like the rest of communism.\n \n 11,12. We're lucky to live in a country where military service is by choice. The next best way to satisfy the need for personnel is a lottery draft. Mandatory service for all able bodied people would be worse than a draft. This is the way some countries do it now....EVERYBODY SERVES.\n \n If not enough people volunteer, there will be a draft. Get used to it. I suppose the population of Canada will increase when the draft comes. This is not all bad...at least we'll be getting rid of some chickens who would depend on others to defend their freedom.",

Historically high valuations for most companies on the stock market, historically high values for houses compared to the incomes of homeowners. The loss of industrial leadership for the US economy.\n \n The Chineses and Saudis have keep the low interest rate party going on for the last few years. If they ever should decided to stop buying federal bonds the party will end and the US economy will have a very tough time.\n \n When a country goes from being the worlds biggest lender to be being the worlds biggest debtor nation in a period of 30 years something bad is going on. To much of the US economy is based on \" churning money around\". Buying and selling of nonproductive services (lawyers, investment banking) is making the economy look healthy while reducing the US competitiveness in manufacturing.
