   "I just read this article by Joe Scarborough. http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9665505/#060130a\n \n \nIt's only one poll, but what a warning shot for Republicans running Congress.\n \n An ABC/Washington Post poll just released shows that Americans prefer the direction a Democratic Congress would take the country by 20% over the Republican path. \n\n \n \n Needless to say, the article ended with his usual apologetic spin favoring the Republican Party but the fact that he even acknowleges their current flaws at the beginning of the article threw me for a loop. He's almost as rightwing twisted as O'Reilly. This HAD to hurt!",
