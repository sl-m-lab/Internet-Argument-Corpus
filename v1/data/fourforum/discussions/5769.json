Plus alcohol has many bodily harms as well. Such as the liver for one example but it effects more more body parts then pot does.\n \n The 20,000 joints theory is true. What the site did was take the average amount of THC in a joint then the amount needed to OD on THC and divided it. It came out to around 20,000 average joints. In other words no one has ever died from ODing on weed.\n \n As with Holland I have actually heard differently from many sources that crime is down and that the use of the drugs has gone down.

No, and the same is true for people who smoke pot. Oh, sure they may also do other things once and a while, but it wasn't simply because they tried that first joint. It's just a personality trait and a common one. If pot didn't exist, these people would be doing something else. The same with alcohol and cigarettes. If they didn't exist, people would find some other type of vice.\n \n \nYou would be a fool to think marijuana isn't harmful. You would be a fool to think alcohol isn't either. Although 1 beer a day is much better then a joint.\n\n Hell, one joint a day isn't going to kill anyone.\n But who drinks one beer a day? No one drinks beer like that, or not many people at all, anyway. People who drink beer (like me and you) will drink a few one day, and for a few reasons. I like good beers, like microbrews and we have a few good ones here, so I like beer for its flavor. I also like the fact that if I drink 24-48 oz. of the stuff I catch a nice buzz. \n \n I also like to buy good pot. It smells great, tastes great and gives you a nice mellow buzz.\n \n But alot of people will come home from work and drink 3-4 beers every single day. This has to add up to bad health. \n \n A glass of red wine though is supposed to be good for you. (That must be why I drink it so often. ;))\n \n Anyway, you're going way overboard with what marijuana does to people.\n It's truly less harmful than alcohol, it can only interfere with your life if you let it. The person who would do this would do it with anything. If pot didn't exist or alcohol didn;t exist, they;d find some way to screw up their lives. This doesn't mean that there aren't millions of responsible casual pot smokers who lead normal productive lives. You probably come into contact with tons of closet smokers and don't even realize it.",

However I doubt most people who use pot, use anywhere near that amount a day. Considering the % of the population that's tried pot, and the % that has tried heroin, pot use seems to rarely lead ot heroin addiction.

You have a guy drink a beer a day and a guy smoke up a day and see the difference in 50yrs...you will know which one is the weed addict.\n\n Rationalizing?\n I guess so, since I'm trying to explain why it's silly for it to be illegal.\n But, guess what, you are rationalizing why beer is legal.\n And you're SO WRONG about drinking beer for 50 years. \n Drink enough beer to get a buzz and smoke enough pot to get a buzz every day and the beer drinker will be worse off.\n But you and I both know that all this depends on the person.\n \n If you want to limit it to a beer a day then I can limit it to one toke a day.\n There you go...\n If weed is good enough, one or two tokes is all you need.\n You probably got WAY less tar than a cigarette and you didn't tax your liver with alcohol. (You also didn't tax your kidneys and GI tract with caffiene.)\n \n [quote]I've lost 2 friends to weed and my gf has actually had a friend get his head blown off so you probably won't convince me it is a good drug....[/quote}\n Good lord, let's all go watch Reefer Madness everyone.\n \n Please, explain how you \"lost\" these friends \"to weed.\"\n If your friend of a friend got his head blown off, that had everything to do with it being ILLEGAL...\n \n But really dude, you're making this up anyway and it's silly.\n \n \nhowever, like alcohol, it is impossible to convince someone addicted about how their addiction hurts them.\n\n No s-\n Any addiction is detrimental.\n Like I said, I was totally addicted to a legal drug (coffee) and I realized how it was hurting me, I'm not exaggerating. \n That legal drug was hurting me way worse than weed ever could.\n How's that for rationalizing?",

These effects can last up to 24 hours after smoking marijuana. Marijuana use can make it difficult to judge distances and react to signals and sounds on the road.\n\n \n http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=38100\n \n \n\n What are some of the immediate effects of smoking marijuana?\n Some immediate physical effects of marijuana include a faster heartbeat and pulse rate, bloodshot eyes, and a dry mouth and throat. No scientific evidence indicates that marijuana improves hearing, eyesight, and skin sensitivity. Studies of marijuana's mental effects show that the drug can impair or reduce short-term memory, alter sense of time, and reduce ability to do things which require concentration, swift reactions, and coordination, such as driving a car or operating machinery.\n\n \n http://www.well.com/user/woa/fspot.htm\n \n \n\n Marijuana, even in low to moderate doses, negatively affects driving performance in real situations. While previous research on alcohol effects alone show that alcohol at BACs around .10 is far more impairing than low or moderate THC doses alone, marijuana does impair driving performance. Drivers would be less than normally able to avoid collisions if confronted with the sudden need for evasive action. The effect of combining moderate doses of alcohol and moderate doses of marijuana resulted in a dramatic performance decrement and levels of impairment, as great as observed when at 0.14 BAC alone.\n\n \n http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/outreach/traftech/pub/tt201.html\n \n Can we please stop with the non-sense now?",

Some violence occurs to fill a street void, but not often as territories were well established long ago (the drug 'wars' of the 1980s and early 1990s) due to the immense profitability factor. \n \n Users, consumers in possession, are the most common LE arrest and (meth excepted) considered non-violent. They're generally given a free LE ride if they identify their source of supply, the street dealer. Due to the immensity of the US drug trade, the street dealer seldom testifies against his/her supplier who controls the territory, valuing his/her life and that of family members and friends. Mercy and understanding are not in drug trade P&Ps. \n \n So our LE devoted to drug enforcement grows faster than a hutch of rabbits, our judicial system is hopelessly clogged, jails and prisons are full with early release due to overcrowding being a daily occurrence and it's 'business as usual' in the stabilized, tax-free drug trade with few interruptions.\nBut, street dealers often carry handguns and drug deals can turn to murder. Could there be no correlation between the arrest of street level dealers and the decrease in murder rates?",

   "But, street dealers often carry handguns and drug deals can turn to murder. Could there be no correlation between the arrest of street level dealers and the decrease in murder rates?\n\n \n Look at it this way; street level dealers with or without guns are replaced within hours of not servicing their client\u00e8le. In most cases the weapons are for rip-off protection, not territory rights. Actual product delivery people in most inner-cities are 10-12-year old kids who carry the drugs because they take juvenile falls, not criminal code arrests. There's no jostling for territory, that's well established. Major killings (numbers) from the early, organizational period were over territory and supply rights. Those after power in the form of establishing territorial rights didn't kill another dealer, they decimated entire organizations. Colombians were known for taking out all members of associated families. \n \n Illegal or not, the drug trade is a well-organized and very profitable business. Like any other business, risk factors are evaluated and adjusted to accomplish product distribution with minimal disruption. Increased LE arrests from traffic stops, burglar apprehension and other non-drug crimes to turn and identify street level dealers are just reactive LE making their numbers, in no way contributing to the decease in drug-related murders.",

   "I support legalization of every drug. I'm sure most of you are young and have been fed XXXX like \"Marijuana will kill you.\" Actually it does less damage to the brain then alcohol and it cannot kill you. It is impossible. It takes 20,000 joints in one sitting to overdose on marijuana. Alcohol however kills thousands of americans each year from alcohol poisoning. You know that idiot pothead. He didn't get dumb from pot, he got dumb from birth. Marijuana does not have long term effects on IQ. The only side effect is the lazy side effect. The day after a person tends to be more lazy however it is like a hang over..... it only lasts for a day. There is no reason why it should remain illegal.\n I also support all drugs being legalized because the drug war has failed. We spend billions each year on the drug war and I can call someone right now and pick up some crack. It is a failure. What we should do is make it government controlled and then spend the money to fight drugs on drug education. Flood the schools with ACTUAL info about how herion kills and how it breaks a person down. Tell the kids how you can die from one use of coke. Tell them the short term and long term effects of each drug. If we can educate our kids and even adults through an ad campaign about what drugs do to you then we could save far more people. Also allowing drugs to be regulated will lower the prices and effectively kill drug dealers and gangs off the streets. There are so many benefits to legalizing drugs. Anyone want to fight it? I have proof to back up what I say and also have the effects of each drug.\n\n \n I too support decriminalizing Marijuana.\n Because I know alot of pot heads and they don't hurt anyone.\n You don't see people robbing banks or killing or raping on a joint.\n You are right you can not overdose on marijuana.\n However to say it does not kill you is wrong.\n Anything that effects the mind like that does kill you it just takes time.\n Pop kills,tobacco kills,driving a car kills and water kills (usually too much at one time but however it might have some additives in it that someone might be allergic to).\n You are also correct that the war on drugs is not working it is a miserable failure.\n However we can not decriminalize hard drugs like Crack and Heroine and most of all Meth.\n Any money seized in these wars should go for education.\n But how can children respect the teachings of why they will harm you and destroy your life if they can easily get it?\n I know a meth user (I hate this guy but he uses).\n If I was a kid being taught how it kills and I know he uses and I can legally get it why would I believe you that it kills?\n But some parents would have a problem with real education on how drugs kill.\n Let the kids see a crack head in the hospital who was rushed there for an overdose.\n I have seen it.\n Not pretty.\n But the hard things are worth watching.",

   "The amount of Bs I've heard in this thread so far has been amazing. First off it is safer for your body to smoke a joint then to drink one beer just look at the facts. I'm tired of people making this drug to be worse then it is, it is ranked as the least habit forming and least addicting Intoxicant available. It doesn't cause any type of brain damage, it doesn't kill brain cells, and the \"laziness\" associated with this drug is known most often to occur in minors. If you want to know more about Weed myths visit this site here it is completely backed up with studies and other data to support its conclusions: http://paranoia.lycaeum.org/marijuana/facts/. If anyone can prove anything contained in this site wrong I would gladly hear him or her out.\n Now the debate of legalization of drugs is a debate that shouldn't exist in the first place if people would just remember what happened during prohibition of Alcohol.\n There are many claims about how crime will go down or how violent crime has gone up blah blah blah.... None of this really matters if you look at the big picture. Think about it, when you buy drugs whom do you think produces sells and profits from these drugs? Whose profits and financial support would disappear if drugs were to be legalized? That's right, gangsters and terrorists that's who and no amount of law enforcement will ever be able to fully stop them, its just not working its as simple as that. Many people say that if drugs became legal that usage would rise. Well this is logical and I agree it would rise, but not by much and not enough to justify the wasted money, lives and the power prohibition grants organized crime and terrorists as well as the rampant corruption of public figures. Many people talk about legalization as if it will bring all sorts of problems associated with drug use. Let me clue you in: the problems already exist and drugs currently are illegal so, explain to me again how all these problems would magically arise if drugs were legal, but for some reason don't exist now? Now I agree that the problems would rise, but again not enough to justify the wasted money, lives and the power prohibition grants organized crime and terrorists as well as the rampant corruption of public figures. Many people say that of course crime would go down it would be the same if you legalized murder. This simply is not true there is a large amount of crime associated with drug use as well as selling drugs so, crime would go down but, in many different areas that hurt our society much more then drug use. Claims that drug use will sky rocket are simply false this has been proven true with prohibition. Also minors will have restricted from drugs due to age limits. It was much harder for me to get dope then it was for me to get a beer. To get beer I had to know somebody that was 21 and that was willing to buy me beer but, to get drugs I just had to know a dealer and many weren't much older then me when I was 16. Comon people the drug war is a lost cause that is hurting our county so, give it up already!",
