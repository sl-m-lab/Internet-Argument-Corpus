   "The US isn't as imperialistic as it could be. I hope you will at least grant us that. In our past we have tried to expand our area of control as much as possible while other powerful countries were grasping at areas of land around the world. Most of this expansion has ended and now it would seem that economics are where the US influence is spreading. Even our culture has begun to spread across the world as has our language and people. We are buying control and using our economic power to attain more economic power. We have used our technology as well to gain power. One shocking example of this is that much of Europe is dependent on our GPS system in ways pertaining to their military and we could theoretically block GPS signals to them at any time.\n \n So I'll go as far as to say that the US is always going to look to expand it's influence on the rest of the world, but we could go much further than this. Our military strength is a bargaining tool and our political connections would allow us to forum quite a powerful army if indeed we wished to do so. I don't doubt that the US with the support of Russia or China or NATO or the UN could take control of much of the world through force. I don't doubt that had Germany/Japan or Russia/China become the superpowers that the threat of force could have been the most dominant way of expanding areas of control. Although I doubt that every country is happy to see the US gaining more influence and control in the world through the use of politics, technology, and economy, I don't think they would be any happier with many of the other superpowers that could have taken the US's place.",

It's about money. The accumulation of monay by a small portion of people. Take people's land by force, make them work for you, make them destroy their land to hand you what you find valuable, so you can get richer. If they refuse, kill them. That is imperialism. \n \n The nature of the market system is that you can only make a super-profit by extreme exploitation.

The previous superpowers of the world tried to expand their influence just as the current ones do and the future ones will too. That is what you get for being a world leader.\n\n \n You assume that what has been the case only for the last five hundred years of the hundreds of thousands of years of human history is a permanent institution. Short-sighted predictions of the future are frequently inaccurate. The only constant is change. Imperalism is a fart in the wind as far as humanity is concerned.\n \n If what you mean when you say \"world leader\" is \"imperialist mass-murdering greedy thief\", then yes, I suppose that is what you get.\n \n \"We have 50 percent of the world's wealth, but only 6.3 percent of its population. . . In this situation we cannot fail to be the object of envy and resentment. Our real task in the coming period is to devise a pattern of relationships which will allow us to maintain this position of disparity. We should cease to talk about the raising of the living standards, human rights, and democratization. The day is not far off when we are going to have to deal in straight power concepts. The less we are then hampered by idealistic slogans, the better.\" \n \n -- George Kennan, Director of Policy Planning of the U.S. Dept. of State, 1948 \n \n \n \"War is just a racket. A racket is best described, I believe, as something that is not what it seems to the majority of people. Only a small inside group knows what it is about. It is conducted for the benefit of the very few at the expense of the masses. \n I believe in adequate defense at the coastline and nothing else. If a nation comes over here to fight, then we'll fight. The trouble with America is that when the dollar only earns 6 percent over here, then it gets restless and goes overseas to get 100 percent. Then the flag follows the dollar and the soldiers follow the flag. \n \n I wouldn't go to war again as I have done to protect some lousy investment of the bankers. There are only two things we should fight for. One is the defense of our homes and the other is the Bill of Rights. War for any other reason is simply a racket. \n \n There isn't a trick in the racketeering bag that the military gang is blind to. It has its \"finger men\" to point out enemies, its \"muscle men\" to destroy enemies, its \"brain men\" to plan war preparations, and a \"Big Boss\" Super-Nationalistic-Capitalism. \n \n It may seem odd for me, a military man to adopt such a comparison. Truthfulness compels me to. I spent thirty-three years and four months in active military service as a member of this country's most agile military force, the Marine Corps. I served in all commissioned ranks from Second Lieutenant to Major-General. And during that period, I spent most of my time being a high class muscle-man for Big Business, for Wall Street and for the Bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism. \n \n I suspected I was just part of a racket at the time. Now I am sure of it. Like all the members of the military profession, I never had a thought of my own until I left the service. My mental faculties remained in suspended animation while I obeyed the orders of higher-ups. This is typical with everyone in the military service. \n \n I helped make Mexico, especially Tampico, safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefits of Wall Street. The record of racketeering is long. I helped purify Nicaragua for the international banking house of Brown Brothers in 1909-1912 (where have I heard that name before?). I brought light to the Dominican Republic for American sugar interests in 1916. In China I helped to see to it that Standard Oil went its way unmolested. \n \n During those years, I had, as the boys in the back room would say, a swell racket. Looking back on it, I feel that I could have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents.\" \n \n -- Excerpt from a speech delivered in 1933 by Major General Smedley Butler, USMC",

Before you trash the USA don't forget that these men and FDR: http://home.st.net.au/~dunn/usarmy/usarmy.htm saved your hinnie in the early 20th century.\n \n I hear Japanese soldiers had a fondness for Aussie women.\n\n \n So did some Americans...\n http://home.st.net.au/~dunn/ozatwar/eddieleonski.htm\n \n And\n http://home.st.net.au/~dunn/ozatwar/bob.htm\n \n So, you're not arguing against the facts as presented by Mizmaxx, and expanded (in a small way) by myself.\n \n It is in fact an imperialist myth, thank you very much, to say that you saved us. American involvement in WWII did not begin in 1939, when we went to war. It didn't despite your commitment to aid China (attacked since 1933). You intervened in your own national interest. IF you saved us, it was in your national interest - in an effort to have a strong supply base to strike back at Japan.\n \n Let's settle the record.\n \n When Japan entered the war, most of our forces were overseas fighting against the Germans and Italians in North Africa. Our Prime Minister, John Curtin wanted to withdraw out troops to defend our own country. This became more critical when the Japanese had very early successes in Singapore and the Philippines.\n \n \"Winston Churchill wanted these troops to be diverted to Burma to stop the Japanese from invading India \"Backed unanimously by War Cabinet and caucus, Curtin followed the formal advice. He had no doubts and days and nights of bitter cable exchanges with Churchill followed.  President Roosevelt was also bringing pressure to bear.  Parliament met twice in secret session. The last straw was Churchill ordering the 7th Division to turn north for Burma, but he had to give way after no fewer than four staunch Australian protests. Curtin played a pivotal role in changing Australia from a nation with an inward perspective, regarding itself as a colonial satellite of Great Britain which sided automatically with the Mother country, to a nation with a more international outlook capable and prepared to make its own decisions. By standing up to Churchill, he ensured that Australia's interests were not overridden by Britain's.\"\n http://john.curtin.edu.au/resources/biography/details.html\n \n Roosevelt wanted Australia's troops, not to defend our own country, but to defend India (which both he and Churchill believed was more important than Australia). \"One could conclude that Curtin's place in Australian history is on a spur to the main path of advance.  He stood up to Roosevelt and Churchill and saved Australian troops of the 7th Division from joining the 8th in Japanese prisoner of war camps, their almost certain fate if committed to Burma without air support or sea control, and under British command. He put Australia on a total war footing. He became the central figure in one of our most affecting stories. But he did not fight the Battle of Australia because it never took place, he did not \"save\" Australia from a Japanese attack which was always unlikely and soon impossible, and he did not take part in the key strategic decisions of the Pacific war. As a war lord Curtin was not in the class of Churchill or Roosevelt.\"\n http://john.curtin.edu.au/events/speeches/edwardsj.html\n \n Our war effort was not as mighty as the USA's, however in your national interest, you at first wanted to abandon Australia! Then when Curtin stood up to you you made plans on how to then best carry out the war, from Australia. However, even then, excepting for your navy, your army still had to be raised - and many of the soldiers were ear-marked not for the Pacific, but for Britain.\n \n \"During 1942, US forces in Australia steadily increased in number, but did not exceed Australian forces until 1943. Until then, the country?s defence relied mainly on Australian efforts, reinforced by the occasional intervention of US naval forces from Hawaii.\"\n http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/meetpm.asp?pmId=14&pageName=inoffice\n \n \"With their naval forces effectively defeated, the Japanese called off their planned capture of Port Moresby by sea. Instead they launched a land attack, across the Owen Stanley mountains. Establishing bases on the north coast of New Guinea, the Japanese forces began the assault on Port Moresby. MacArthur was slow to respond to this challenge, not believing a successful attack across the forbidding terrain was likely. But the Japanese soldiers captured Kokoda, and pushed on towards Port Moresby. At MacArthur?s urging, Curtin ordered the Australian army commander, General Thomas Blamey, to go to Port Moresby to take personal charge of its defence. Blamey arrived at Port Moresby in late September, in the middle of an eight-week Australian offensive on the Kokoda Trail. But the Japanese defeat at Milne Bay made their advance impossible, and the victory at Kokoda on 2 November 1942 marked the turning point in the southward sweep of the Japanese offensive. The Japanese commanders turned their attention to the Solomon Islands base of Guadalcanal.\"\n (Ibid)\n \n So, even when we were allies, you were quite prepared to abandon us, because in the global scheme of things, 7million Australians were not as important as the wealth of supplies from India!\n \n Thank you America for saving us!\n \n \n I suggest in future you do a more thorough research because history is my favourite subject... and I'll ping you every time.",

Your dogged determination not to face up to facts leaves me amazed.\n \n So indeed, \n \n \nGive credit where it is due? I can say the same to you.\n You can say the same for me, but as you're the only one in denial about all those other millions of people involved in the war against Japan and Germany, you saying it is totally meaningless.\n \n Can I also remind you that you really need to do some reading on a matter you wish to debate, in order to avoid making such a screamer as this... \nI am sure the Aussies in 1940 had enough aircraft carriers to prevent a homeland invasion.\n which is such a vapid statement, that it's injection here into the debate makes no sense..\n \n In 1940\n a) we didn't face invasion\n b) the war was on, yes, but the US actually didn't become involved until 7th December 1941 or are you unaware of this.\n \n This is what annoys a lot of your allies; an Australia is one of your most consistent! Even your friends you treat with such contempt and disdain. When we fought the Japanese in New Guinea in 1942, MacArthur did this. He had reported all the victories back in the US press. When you guys won a battle it was \"An American Victory\", however, when we won a victory it was \"American and her allies victory,\" even when you didn't participate, such as when we drove the Japanese back from Port Moresby, and when we defeated them at Suva Bay.\n \n Your fellow Imperialist, Great Britain did the same. Pick up most text books that deal with the victory over the Germans and Italians at Tobruk (1941)* it will usually state \"British victory\" or \"British and Commonwealth forces victory\", despite the fact that the commander was Australian, the bulk of the troops were Australian; the 9th Division. You are simply following that arrogant pattern.\n \n Your version of history rests on popular mythologies rather than facts.\n \n *don't get it confused with the battle in 1942 when our troops had been pulled out of that theatre of war to defend our homeland - the same land you guys thought was less important than Burma!\n \n Why don't you actually deal with something I say, rather then just have recourse to vomiting out jingoisms?",

   "As it stands now I don't think that the US government will fall because of internal influences. As long as we maintain our standing as an economic power there is no real threat that can be posed to our government.\n \n The British empire collapsed because they were spread way too thin and couldn't really defend all their territories. The US is well covered as far as it's own population goes. There really is no rising threat in the internal population that is threatening the government.\n \n I just don't find it too realistic that the US will collapse from the inside out instead of the other way around. External forces are previlant in our globalized system especially in the case of economics. If another country becomes an economic power, such as China and India probably will, then they will pose an external threat to the US way of life. This may lead to a chain reaction that eventually collapses the US. Still I think it will take some major external pressure like this before the internal forces can even become important enough to threaten the US empire. However, because of globalization it is likely that the US and the next superpower(s) will be economically linked and will keep each other afloat as long as war doesn't break out. This attribute of globalization has been keeping stability in the worlds economic powers for years now and I wouldn't suspect that this will change in the future either.\n \n The US form of imperialism has been one that has both strengthend ourselves and has brought stability to the worlds strongest countries as well as increased stability in the third world countries. With the way that this system works it will either take a major world war or a major economic collapse before the US or any other major superpower could fall in my opinion.

As far as big mouth...you are absolutely correct, old Kimmy needs a muzzle and a haircut. As far as small, not quite. N. Korea has one of the largest armies in the world, and they could threaten many of our allies in a number of ways, like S. Korea, or Japan. Remember, we fought them once, yet the threat remains. Are we likely to lose today, probably not, but engaging in war with N. Korea is a huge risk to the US.\n\n \n North Korea will probably continue to be a thorn in our side and as long as that is true they will face great external instability. They are risking everything by threatening us and should they follow through we will be hurt but they will be dead.\n \n They are small in land size and that means a single nuke will destroy a greater percentage of their land than a single nuke will do to the US. This becomes a big deal in nuclear battles as does population and world connections. The US would have support in a nuclear conflict if attacked. North Korea is likely to be the one attacking so they would have little in the way of world connections. This also hurts them because they are too small to completely supply themselves and this can be shown based on their starving populations even while they recieve aid packages from the US and China. Small matters especially in nuclear conflict.\n \n As for their army they are a threat but they are not as threatening as their numbers would bear out. The country would be in so much chaos after a few nuclear strikes that I wouldn't expect them to be able to stand up to a US led attack and it could even be Iraq all over again. The chain of command would fail as poor communications and lack of supply + food + oil becomes and issue. A broken North Korea would crumble especially in the face of a very angry US led attack. Their military wouldn't be able to protect anything and would be best served to begin a gurilla war because they would fail in straight conflict.\n \n You prove my point when you bring up the Korean war. The North Koreans controlled almost the whole of Korea and we took almost EVERYTHING back. They had nothing except a sure defeat until the Chinese got involved. This is the world connection that the North Koreans lack. Sure China will support North Korea as long as they are being good. If you see the North march on Seoul or nuke Japan or, God forbid, Los Angeles, I would wager a guess that China will march on North Korea in response. China surely wouldn't support the North Koreans for being the aggressor nor did they do so in the Korean war.\n \n \n In short, North Korea faces external stability issues just as the US does. The problem for North Korea is that they cannot deal with the consequences of extreme instability while the US can. A few chemical and nuclear strikes on the US will hurt us. That is what the US faces in an extreme case. The force of a US led war against North Korea is what the North Koreans face in an extreme case. They would either be destroyed or lose control over their country.\n \n \n Having said all this I would like to ask this question of you again. Does the US really have a great problem with external instability than the North Koreans do at this time?",

Korea will not come to harm unless they push the issue and make the world attack them. They control this destiny, and therefore the threat can be mitigated by themselves. The US, regardless of what we do, who we try to make friends with, or what foreign policy we change will continue to be a target for extremist regimes throughout the world. We do not control who attacks us, the terrorist regimes are not going to wait for us to do anything to them before they attack...as seen on 9/11, they will just attack us. It is not a numbers game to me as far as who will lose more people, or how much will be destroyed. When I consider threats, I consider who is more likely to be attacked, and my answer remains the US.",

When I consider threats, I consider who is more likely to be attacked, and my answer remains the US.\n\n \n North Korea even faces the threat of attack without having to push the issue. See Iraq for more info.\n \n North Korea doesn't control their own destiny. If the US wants a war all they have to do is cut aid to North Korea and sanction them up the ***. The North will have no choice but to go to war and the US will be ready. The North has backed themselves into a corner where the US has control of their future in more ways than one. The one thing they have going for them is the fact that the US doesn't want a nuclear conflict. But should the US decide to go forward with this anyways they are the ones in control of how far this conflict will escalate. North Korea is in the hands of the US before and after war begins, that is not control. No one can put the US in this situation. The terrorists and terrorist supporters can only force the US to attack them, their homes, and way of life and await defeat. A nuclear attack against us will probably cause the fall of several countries while a nuclear attack against North Korea would cause the fall of their country.\n \n Also your note of no matter who the US makes friends with we will still have enemies can apply to every country. At least the US is in a great position to defend themselves after an attack like this. Countries in the EU face terrorism just as the Middle East does and most of the rest of the worlds countries. External instability like this will exist forever unless you want to turn this into 1984 in which case the terrorists win.\n \n Why do you even bring up 9/11 and mention that we have no control over attacks against us? Guess what, we have proven that we have some control over how often we get attacked. We responded to 9/11 in a way that collapsed two governments and put us partial control of two different nations. We also increased our own internal security to protect ourselves from the outside. After that we had zero terrorist attacks against us. Our response was powerful and our safeguards were well placed and as a result we are now in more control over attacks against us, wouldn't you agree?\n \n Who is more likely to be attacked is probably the US but that doesn't mean we face the greater external instability threat. For instance, the 6'6 linebacker vs the insane person. No one wants to hurt he insane person here yet he has his life at risk. Everyone wants to attack the linebacker yet he is in a position to defend himself and will not lose if attacked. So who has more at risk? The linebacker who will get attacked and win or the insane person who will probably do something stupid and die?\n \n I don't know what the odds are of North Korea doing something stupid but the situation doesn't look all that great for them. First off China is the real player here, not the US. China can dictate what North Korea does or doesn't do. If China puts heat on North Korea they will give in. The US can only use force to make North Korea give in. So how might China turn against North Korea? Surely North Korea won't make a first strike as that is suicide. They are already completely contained because they depend too much on Chinese support to risk it all. There is no risk-reward ratio for this situation, it is all risk. I think the US will take advantage of this situation by helping (secretly ie Israel) Japan or South Korea to get their own nuclear weapons program going. This will freak the Chinese out instantly and they will demand that the US help end this. The Japanise or South Korean government will claim they are looking to defend themselves from the North Korean threat. The Chinese will have only two choices of either dealing with North Korea and ending the threat or face the threat of Japan and South Korea building a legitimate nuclear defense. China will do what is in their interest which is drop the support of North Korea. At that point North Korea will have everything to lose and nothing to gain. They will have the option of either ending their program, keeping their program and being cut off from the world, or attacking and going out in a blaze of horrifying glory. This is a chess game that the US can control through China or China can simply take control and bring it to an end right now.\n \n \n My opinion remains that the US is not as threatened by external instability as North Korea is. I believe the US can even guide the destruction of North Korea if we wish to and make it look legitimate to the world. The US has such great power, strength, and size that we can overcome a lot of obsticles while North Korea cannot overcome the simplest of them. The war on terrorism is as threatening to the US as WWII and yet we are being as successful in this war as we were in WWII. North Korea is now facing the threat of WWIII coming to them as well as the threat of humiliation if forced to drop their nuclear weapons program and the risk of isolating themselves from the world if they don't drop their program. The US faces only 1 of these threats and we of course are able to maintain a 'legitimate' nuclear weapons program all the while.\n \n North Korea is going to inevitably be hurt by external forces because of their external instability very badly just as the US will be. It is just a matter of who can shake it off and dish some out and who cannot.",

Had they bombed the Pentagon, that would have been another story entirely- that would have clearly been a defensive rebuttal.
