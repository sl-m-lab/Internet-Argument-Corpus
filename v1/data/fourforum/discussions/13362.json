Your initial post refuses to appreciate that.\n \n \n 4) Considering your sole point in your opening post was to whine about hypocrisy, can I take it that your previous complaints that you don't see a significance in hypocrisy have now been changed?\n Nah.

   "President Bush has said repeatedly that he would not insert himself into the presidential race, but that stance changed dramatically today during his trip to Israel.

We have heard this foolish delusion before,\" Bush said in remarks to the Israeli Knesset. \"As Nazi tanks crossed into Poland in 1939, an American Senator declared: 'Lord, if only I could have talked to Hitler, all of this might have been avoided.'
