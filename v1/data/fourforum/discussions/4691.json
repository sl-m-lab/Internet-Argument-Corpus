   "for Daewoo\n \nJourney of an Islamist Party: U.S. Enemy to Partner in Iraq\n New Prime Minister Embraces Western-Style Democracy; Cleared in Deadly Bombing\n 'All Movements Are Watching'\n By YAROSLAV TROFIMOV \n Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\n April 28, 2005; Page A1\n \n BAGHDAD, Iraq -- At a neighborhood club of Daawa -- the political party of Iraq's new prime minister -- a banner celebrates \"the blood of our martyrs,\" and stern ayatollahs stare from posters on the walls. But inside, a new library is packed with unexpected literature: books donated by American forces. A volume called \"Essentials of American Government\" lies atop one box.\n \n Born in Iraq a half-century ago, Daawa is one of the oldest Islamist movements in the world. Fiercely anti-American until recently, it spawned terrorist groups like the Lebanese Hezbollah, and itself was implicated in bombing an American embassy. The U.S., in turn, considered the group anathema.\n \n But since the first formal contact between Daawa's leaders and Washington 21/2 years ago, a history of mutual hostility started melting away -- replaced by a deepening alliance that's underpinned by the common goal of stabilizing Iraq.\n \n \n Now, Daawa chief Ibrahim al Jaafari -- who says he had never even talked to an American until 2002 and who now lives surrounded by U.S. Navy bodyguards -- is taking over as Iraq's first democratically elected head of government. Yesterday, Mr. Jaafari drew up the country's new cabinet, which is expected to be endorsed by Parliament as soon as today. \"We have a very strong, warm and close relationship\" with the U.S., he says in an interview. \"It's not a sign of weakness to change our worldview.\"\n \n The tale of this unusual rapprochement encapsulates the paradox of postwar Iraq and could resonate across the Muslim world. Two years after the U.S. invasion, the costly American effort has brought an Islamist to the helm of a major Arab nation for the first time in the region's history. But it also marked the first time that a large Islamist movement is breaking with an anti-American tradition that had defined its ideology.\n \n With Mr. Jaafari as prime minister and a broader Islamist Shiite coalition holding a majority in the nation's new Parliament, this experiment will be tested by the hard task of rebuilding Iraq and shaping its future constitution. If successful, it could offer hope that the global conflict between America and political Islam can be defused -- and that other radical groups can be moderated one day by the transforming force of democracy.\n \n \"Who brought us to government? The democratic process,\" says Mr. Jaafari, a 58-year-old physician who returned here in 2003 after more than two decades in exile. \"If we stay on this path, views about America will be changed, in Iraq and outside it. It will send a historic message....All the Islamic movements are watching what's happening here.\"\n \n In the galaxy of political Islam, an ideology that sees the Muslim faith playing a crucial role in government affairs, Daawa boasts a special pedigree. The movement was founded in 1957 by Mohammed Baqr al Sadr, a Shiite scholar from Najaf who reached across sectarian lines and whose writings on politics and economy, widely read in the Arab world, also helped inspire Iran's Islamic revolution.\n \n From its very beginning, Daawa was built as a conspiratorial network that -- until recently -- could be joined only by invitation, after a careful and discreet screening of the potential recruit's morals and politics. In 1980, as Saddam Hussein, a Sunni, unleashed the war on Shiite Iran, he made membership in Daawa punishable by death and ordered the execution of Mr. Sadr. Mass graves across Iraq filled with corpses of suspected Daawa members; party officials estimate the toll of \"martyrs\" in the 1980s and 1990s in the hundreds of thousands.\n \n \n Daawa, backed by Iran, responded to Mr. Hussein's brutality with a terror campaign of its own, attacking Iraqi government buildings and assassinating Baath Party mandarins. Pioneering the tactic of suicide bombings in the Middle East, Daawa blew up the Iraqi embassy in Beirut in 1981. Two years later, Shiite militants set off a synchronized series of bombs in Kuwait, targeting the embassies of the U.S. and France, the two countries then helping Mr. Hussein's regime.\n \n The degree of Daawa's involvement in the Kuwait attack, which killed five, remains unclear to this day. \"At the time it would have benefited us to claim responsibility, we would have had little to lose,\" says Haydar Abbadi, one of the 11 members of the party's collective leadership. \"But Daawa has always said that we didn't do it.\"\n \n Still, Daawa remained firmly off-limits to U.S. outreach when Washington started dealing with Shiite and Kurdish opponents of Mr. Hussein following the 1991 Gulf War.\n \n Then came the Sept. 11 attacks. Long focused on halting the Shiite radicalism exported from Iran, the U.S. saw a new, more urgent threat coming from Osama bin Laden's brand of Sunni extremism. Washington and Tehran soon found themselves on the same side helping topple Afghanistan's Taliban regime.\n \n In late 2002, as Washington was seeking allies for its planned war on Iraq, all the pieces fell in place for a policy breakthrough. An investigation carried out by the U.S. government found that Daawa's new London-based leadership, headed by Mr. Jaafari, wasn't personally implicated in the Kuwait embassy blast, the State Department says. Other excesses committed in the 1980s were framed in a new light. \"To the extent that Daawa was involved in terrorism, it was 90% against Saddam....It was not poised against the U.S.,\" says Wayne White, who headed the Iraq team at the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research until last month. He is now an adjunct scholar at the Middle East Institute in Washington.\n \n Eager to secure Shiite cooperation for the war, the U.S. solicited a meeting with Daawa leaders -- and, in the fall of 2002, a senior State Department delegation gathered with Mr. Jaafari, Mr. Abbadi and other Shiite activists at the movement's office in a London suburb. Over Iraqi kebab and grilled chicken, the Americans outlined plans for deposing Mr. Hussein's regime. Almost as an afterthought, they asked the Daawa officials whether the movement had anything to do with the 1983 embassy blast, participants say. Daawa leaders reiterated their denial. Since then, they say, the issue hasn't come up again.\n \n Despite this d\u00e9tente, Daawa refused to back U.S. war efforts and watched the invasion from the sidelines. This neutrality turned to hostility in April 2003, when the U.S. occupation began. The U.S. chief administrator in Iraq, Jay Garner, called a gathering of Iraqi political groups in the city of Nassiriya, hoping to use the meeting to form an embryonic Iraqi government. By refusing to attend the Nassiriya conference and launching the first anti-American street protests, Daawa and other Islamist groups helped torpedo the plan.\n \n But as Iraq, devastated by postwar looting, started reeling under a predominantly Sunni insurgency, Daawa and another Islamist group made a conscious decision to join the new order. They calculated that the Americans' stated goal, democracy, would eventually lead them to power in a country where Shiites make up a majority of the population and religious feelings run strong.\n \n So, in July 2003, Mr. Jaafari accepted a U.S. invitation to join the Interim Governing Council, the first postwar Iraqi administration created by Mr. Garner's replacement, Coalition Provisional Authority chief Paul Bremer.\n \n In the new regime, every Iraqi minister was flanked by an American \"senior adviser\" who controlled the purse-strings. At the health ministry, Khudair Abbas, a surgeon prominent in Daawa's London faction, was paired with Jim Haveman, the former director of Michigan's Department of Community Health.\n \n Mr. Haveman says that he had heard plenty about Daawa's murky past before first meeting Mr. Abbas and Mr. Jaafari. But he found his new partners to be worlds away from the image of fire-breathing radicals. \"If anything, they were long-suffering, patient, tolerant and accepting,\" says Mr. Haveman.\n \n While disagreeing at times on sensitive issues -- such as the takeover of Iraqi hospitals by American forces during anti-insurgency operations -- Mr. Haveman and Mr. Abbas say that they could always reach a civilized compromise. The two men met almost every day in the sprawling ministry building -- and managed to restore basic services so quickly that the health ministry became the first part of the government to be returned to Iraqi sovereignty in 2004.\n \n For Mr. Abbas, too, this experience proved an eye-opener. \"With all the propaganda from before, everyone had preconceived ideas in their minds. I thought Americans are arrogant, not respectful of others, feeling that they're superior,\" he says, \"Then I realized that this is not the case: They were ordinary human beings and very easy to work with.\"\n \n Yet, as trust was building between midlevel officials like Mr. Haveman and Mr. Abbas, suspicion about Daawa's intentions still lingered in Washington. Fearful that Islamists would win, the U.S. shelved talk of democratic elections. Instead, Mr. Bremer's transition plan called for a complicated system of caucuses that would select screened representatives to form a new national assembly.\n \n But Islamists had no intention of being shunted aside. On the call of the Shiite spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali al Sistani, supporters of Daawa and other Shiite movements flooded Iraqi cities in January 2004 to demand elections and a cancellation of the caucuses plan. Then, Shiite parts of Iraq were swept by an uprising led by Muqtada al Sadr, a nephew of Daawa's founder and a young firebrand cleric whose anti-American zeal harked back to the party's earlier era.\n \n In these bloody days, Mr. Jaafari's party stuck by its American allies. Despite Mr. Sadr's veiled accusations that the party was betraying the cause of Islam, Daawa didn't leave U.S.-sponsored institutions and helped negotiate a cease-fire.\n \n The uprising proved a turning point in U.S. attitudes. American officials soon scaled back their ambitious plans to remodel Iraqi society. The new, more realistic goal was to maintain a semblance of stability with the help of palatable allies in order to start pulling out the 140,000 American troops here. That spring, the U.S. agreed to disband the CPA and aborted the plan for caucuses. An interim secular government of Prime Minister Ayad Allawi took over in June, with Mr. Jaafari becoming vice president.\n \n In the run-up to Jan. 30 elections, concerned that Washington may be tempted by old anti-Islamist reflexes to help Mr. Allawi's secular slate, Daawa worked hard to allay concerns that it has plans to enforce religious observance in the country. Leaders also distanced themselves from Iran, saying they strongly oppose their onetime patron's system of clerical rule.\n \n \"We don't think that the religious establishment has enough credentials to lead the state,\" Mr. Abbadi says. \"They have not been trained for that. Once the mullahs rule the state, they become corrupt.\"\n \n Indeed, Mr. Jaafari holds up the West as a model. \"The West has a big respect of human rights....I wish we can achieve the same level in Iraq,\" he says, promising that Daawa won't force women to wear veils or impose Iranian-style Islamic law.\n \n The elections gave the Shiite alliance the majority of seats in the new Parliament and control over provincial governments from Baghdad to Basra. Mr. Jaafari, eager for the broadest possible consensus, has made sure that his government includes women and representatives of Sunni Arabs who had boycotted the elections. He also tried to woo Mr. Allawi's secularist faction.\n \n With new parliamentary elections looming as soon as December, the movement now seeks to broaden its appeal well beyond old, tested cadres, casting itself as a party of competent technocrats that could be a home to Shiites and Sunnis alike.\n \n At one of Daawa's myriad social clubs, a walled compound shaded by palm trees in Baghdad's Karrada neighborhood, Mr. Jaafari's new role, and Daawa's new friendship with the U.S., have left people somewhat dizzy. \"Nobody expected all this to happen,\" said club manager Hassoun Kadhem, a political prisoner under Mr. Hussein. \"Everyone thought the Americans would interfere in the elections to help Allawi. But they didn't, and this really improved our opinion of them.\"\n \n As other activists nodded in agreement, only one Daawa militant voiced dissent. A teacher of Islam, Umm Mohammed, scoffed that the recent rapprochement was just a temporary blip. \"America has not changed: It's still in love with Israel, and it still fears Islam and the Shiites,\" she said from behind a black veil.\n \n Interrupting impatiently, the club's women's programs director, Umm Hussam, rolled her eyes. \"No, of course America has changed,\" she snapped back. \"The Americans used to think that we are terrorists. Now they see how peaceful we are.\"\n",

Now based in Tehran, the group supports the establishment of an Islamic state in Iraq.  \n \n Leadership \n Led by Abu-Bilal al-Adib, Abd al-Razzaq al-Kadhami, and Dr. Haydar al-Abadi. \n \n Funding \n Funded by Iran. \n \n History \n Islamic Dawa Party was established in 1958, based on Association of Najaf Ulama, a political-religious organization that had been established in late 1957 to combat communism. Has coordinated closely with Sunni Islamic organizations. The group was blamed by the Iraqi leaders for actions that necessitated the attack on Iran in 1980. Dawa members mostly either joined the Iranian military units or refrained from political activity altogether. Islamic Dawa Party members staged a major assassination attempt on Saddam Husayn in July of 1982, bombed the Ministry of Planning in August of 1982, and attacked Saddam Hussein's motorcade in April of 1987. Member of Coalition of Iraqi National Forces. \n \n \n That is their official platform. There is a link to their web page at that site if you want to read it on the official Daawa party web page. Once again, we are sleeping with the enemy. The Bush administration has lined up ont he side of the Daawa party because to oppose them would be suicide to our mission in Iraq. Besides an almost certian backlash from the shia community that such opposition would bring, it would certainly make us look like a bunch of jackasses on the international scene to oppose the democratically elected governemtn that we installed, even if their official platform is to form a fundamentlaist state.\n \n Your concession is accepted. As pennance, think for yourself for a day instead of blindly believing whatever garbage the neocons feel compelled to dribble into your head (and yes, I have been saving that link).\n \n \n \nbtw:\n \n i don't consider targetting any military or government installation or personel as terrorism, whether it be against Saddam or the US, pentagon included.\n\n \n Hezbollah is an offshoot of the daawa party.",

A member of its political bureau recently told Al-Hayat that his organization \"does not see any interest in a US withdrawal from Iraq at this moment.\"[10] Nasiri has openly criticized those who have attempted to impose strict Islamic dress codes in Shiite areas.[11] There are also some indications that the party may be cooperating with the United States in rooting out armed resistance. A recent statement by an anti-American Iraqi nationalist group accused al-Daawa of treason for \"informing the occupation forces about the resistance forces.\"[12]\n\n and from July 2003 \n \nAl-Hilli defended Al-Daawa's decision to participate in the council by saying that the caveats referred to the elected government presumably would follow the council. He insisted the council will be dissolved in favor of elections in a \"few months,\" and that elections will be conducted to chose a new parliament and president after voting the constitution. He downplayed the probability of withdrawing his party from the council. \n \n Despite Al-Hilli's assertions, the party has already split as a result of its participation in the council, into Al-Daawa and the Iraqi Al-Daawa Party. \n Al-Hilli denied the significance of the split saying that they are few individuals. But Abdul Kareem Al-Enizi, the official spokesman of the Islamic Al-Daawa Party, simply said the council was illegitimate, adding that Al-Daawa did not attend the London conference in the first place. \n\n elsewhere from the leftward leaning Kos are these links about Al Daawa \n \nIt is useful to contrast Al-Daawa with SCIRI. SCIRI formed as a break-away faction from Al-Daawa in the early 1980s, though the two organizations are still closely allied. While both organizations support the establishment of Islamic law, SCIRI is much friendlier to the idea of clerical control of the government. While both organizations get financial and military support from Iran, Al-Daawa maintained it independence. Both organizations have a military wing but while SCIRI is a conventional militia, Al-Daawa's is a clandestine force.\n\n with this link about the SCIRI \n \nSCIRI is one of the largest and best organized Shia religious parties. It is currently led by Abdel Aziz the brother of its long time leader Ayatollah Muhammad Baqr al-Hakim who was killed in a car bombing in August 2003. Al-Hakim formed SCIRI from members of the pro-Khomeini faction of al-Daawa (another Shia religious party with a very long history). The initial break was in 1980 and after a couple name changes it became SCIRI in 1982. While SCIRI did break away from Al-Daawa it appears to have been a fairly amicable break-up and the groups tend to get a long.\n \n SCIRI is the group most strongly tied to Iran. It military wing, the Badr Brigade trained with Iran's Republican Guard and was under the same command structure prior to the US invasion of Iraq. SCIRI military units fought along side the Iranians against the Iraqis in the Iran-Iraq war. The ties between Iran and SCIRI go both ways. One former senior SCIRI member, Mahmoud Shahrudi has become head of the judicial branch of Iran.\n\n these tidbits suggest that al daawa, while maintaining links to Iran, is not as pro-iran as some of its original members were.\n \n i don't get my info from one source so you can attack these sources as well. and while certainly Jafaari can still act to impose a sharia islamic state, that remains to be seen and the global analysis suggest this is unlikely. \n i'm done with this topic for now.\n rant as much as you want.",

But he did get more honest about us needing a proverty program for the poor when they retire and an investment plan for the rich, which they could do without the government. \n \n ANd Bush has been quite friendly with China and he has certianly help us with that whole NK situation.

   "No offense sir, but most of that is simply spin and not accurate, or at least not totally acurate.\n \n No one has really talkked about giving you more control of SS. Bush is really about eventually elimnating SS. In the interm he has said he will invest it for you, or at least the government will. That isn't the same as you investing it. But he did get more honest about us needing a proverty program for the poor when they retire and an investment plan for the rich, which they could do without the government. \n\n I've been traveling and with intermittant internet capability to boot. emoticon_mad \n Now, to address your first point. Right now, you have ZERO control of your SS investment, so any step towards personal ownership is a plus IMO. Unfortunately, you are correct that Uncle Sam will set up and pick the funds. While that's NOT the way I would have done it, I do understand the reasoning behind it. ie, with the US so used to a Nanny Gov't, we would expect Uncle Sam to bail us out if we picked losing investments and went belly up. With Uncle WSam picking the investments, they're safeguarding themselves from future huge liabilities.\n Personally, I'd let people invest as they saw fit and let the losers starve, but that's not \"the American way\". \n \n\n ANd Bush has been quite friendly with China and he has certianly help us with that whole NK situation. ANd nothing helps China more than rising our national debt.\n\n It was Clinton/Gore who gave China \"most favored nation\" trading status, so don't blame GW2 for it.\n \n\n And Gore was pro choice. That is different than pro abortion.\n\n Pro-choice = pro-abortion. You're just being cute by trying to make a distinction without a difference. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n\n And I point out that a republican congress, with a republican president have virtually made no moves to lessen abortion. In fact, they seemed to deliberately sabatoge efforts to limit them. Kerry was 100% correct that the late term abortion bill needed to have clearier lanuage protecting the saftey of the mother or it would not survive legal challenge. He was right and Bush and his platitudes were wrong.\n\n Democrats wanted an exception that was large enough to drive a truck through. The \"health of the mother\" means nothing to a bunch of Philly lawyers. They could argue that the mother's \"mental health\" was at risk in every instance and they'd win with such nebulous language.\n \n\n Add everything up, and Bush has been so wrong, so often that it is clear these two and anyone else you would like to name would have likely been better.\n\n Gore would have sold us out to the UN via the Kyota Accord, lost us 1Million automotive jobs with his new CAFE requirements, increased the debt (just as GW2 did), neutered the military just as his boss had done, etc.,\n \n\n And we haven't even started on the diaster that is Iraq. :xcensored\n\n Kerry was in favor of the War in Iraq..before he was against it, that is. :) \n \n IMO, GW2 has done plenty wrong. He got in bed with Ted Kennedy on NCLB and started spending like a Damn Democrat, but at least he did so without ceding our sovreignty to a bunch of European socialists in the UN.",

Yes Clinton RENEWED favored nation trading status, and Bush has not recinded it. Neither has held China accountable. And they are very thankful.\n \n Bush himself admits privization will not save SS. And to my knowledge, you have always been free to invest your money. But you might check around an see how well retirees did when the market droped a while back. Sure, young folks can ride it out, but what about when you're retired? But the point is we will, no matter what happens have old folks who simply will not have enough. Are you or are you not willing to help take care of them. That is what we are talking about by the way.\n \n Now, what else? \n \n Nom pro-abortion implies you favor abortion. Many people don't have abortions, don't advise loved ones to have them, really don't care for them, but recognize that there are some doubts here, some problems here and that it is more difficult than some make it out to be. So, they support choice. That means they support letting individuals choose and decide. And frankly, if done early enough, I see the morning after pills as a good compromise, there probably isn't any reason to say it is taking a life any more than any number of failed and unproductive releases produce. \n \n And Gore would have been correct if doing what is best for the planet long term. And since we have to live on this planet, this seems like a reasonable thought.\n \n Now, what Kerry said:\n \n Let me be clear, the vote I will give to the President is for one reason and one reason only: To disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, if we cannot accomplish that objective through new, tough weapons inspections in joint concert with our allies. (remember that inspectors were on the ground)\n \n In giving the President this authority, I expect him to fulfill the commitments he has made to the American people in recent days--to work with the United Nations Security Council to adopt a new resolution setting out tough and immediate inspection requirements, and to act with our allies at our side if we have to disarm Saddam Hussein by force. If he fails to do so, I will be among the first to speak out.\n \n If we do wind up going to war with Iraq, it is imperative that we do so with others in the international community, unless there is a showing of a grave, imminent--and I emphasize \"imminent\"--threat to this country which requires the President to respond in a way that protects our immediate national security needs.\n \n (snip)\n \n Let there be no doubt or confusion about where we stand on this. I will support a multilateral effort to disarm him by force, if we ever exhaust those other options, as the President has promised, but I will not support a unilateral U.S. war against Iraq unless that threat is imminent and the multilateral effort has not proven possible under any circumstances.\n \n In voting to grant the President the authority, I am not giving him carte blanche to run roughshod over every country that poses or may pose some kind of potential threat to the United States. Every nation has the right to act preemptively, if it faces an imminent and grave threat, for its self-defense under the standards of law. The threat we face today with Iraq does not meet that test yet. I emphasize \"yet.\" Yes, it is grave because of the deadliness of Saddam Hussein's arsenal and the very high probability that he might use these weapons one day if not disarmed. But it is not imminent, and no one in the CIA, no intelligence briefing we have had suggests it is imminent. None of our intelligence reports suggest that he is about to launch an attack.\n \n The argument for going to war against Iraq is rooted in enforcement of the international community's demand that he disarm. It is not rooted in the doctrine of preemption. Nor is the grant of authority in this resolution an acknowledgment that Congress accepts or agrees with the President's new strategic doctrine of preemption. Just the opposite. This resolution clearly limits the authority given to the President to use force in Iraq, and Iraq only, and for the specific purpose of defending the United States against the threat posed by Iraq and enforcing relevant Security Council resolutions. \n \n http://www.independentsforkerry.org/uploads/media/kerry-iraq.html",

   "So, as I said, that is the choice. What will we do with elderly who don't make it. We can as a society decide to help out, or we can leave them to the kindness of strangers. Or somewhere in between. It's called problem solving. There will be a problem; how will you solve it?\n\n The first thing we need to do is realize that the elderly are the wealthiest age segment in our country and the \"poor elderly\" that everyone imagines aren't that many. There are many Xs more poor children and young adults than old folks.\n Second, we need to understand why those poor elderly are poor. Are they poor through no fault of their own or are they poor because they squandered their chance to gain financial independence when they were younger? For the former group, there are charities. For the latter group, there's no sympathy from me. It's the ant and the grasshopper fable in real life.\n \n\n That is simply dishonest. Many things are left to individuals to decide. Even with abortion we have limits because there are lines we all agree on. But some areas aren't as clear, so instead of believing the government is best qualified to make the difficut personal decisions, people like me believe there is a palce where it is up to each individual to decide. You use sematics to cloud the issue. I suppose it is used by politicians because they know it is easier than actually winning with logic. But the truth is, whether you like it or not, most are prochoice and not pro abortion. And you shouldn't follow the lead of dishonest politicians.\n\n It's intellectually dishonest to claim that you \"personally\" find abortion morally unacceptable but it's OK for others to engage in. emoticon_confused \n \n\n Seems rather directed towards lowering emissions to me:\n .......\n \n Not to say the wealthy would be obligated to help the poor, but lowering emission is part of the call.\n\n Call it what you like, it wasn't in the US' best interests to sign anything that gave control of our energy policy to the UN.\n \n\n As always in such debates I am presented with cuts without the entire clip. This was effectively done during the campgain and those who never heard the word context bought into into it.

And this one comes from a newspaper that leans generally in favor of Democrats. The editorial appeared Feb. 15:\n \n Washington Post editorial: The most important confusion surrounds Mr. Kerry's position on Iraq. In 1991 he voted against the first Persian Gulf War, saying more support was needed from Americans for a war that he believed would prove costly. In 1998, when President Clinton was considering military steps against Iraq, he strenuously argued for action, with or without allies. Four years later he voted for a resolution authorizing invasion but criticized Mr. Bush for not recruiting allies. Last fall he voted against funding for Iraqi reconstruction, but argued that the United States must support the establishment of a democratic government.\n \n Mr. Kerry's attempts to weave a thread connecting and justifying all these positions are unconvincing. He would do better to offer a more honest accounting.\n",

The military was still segregated with blacks playing a minor, generally support role and bodies were required to help man the factories.\n \n After the Atlanta riots of 1906, the South settled into solid Jim Crow mentality, and that lasted until the early 1950s. The combination of post-WW2 prosperity, that due to FDRs legislation blacks had been integrated into the workplace outside the south and the civil rights movement spearheaded from within black leadership ranks supported by Eastern establishment money (the radicals), their physical presence and media coverage finally gathered enough inertia to break the archaic Dixiecrat grip on discrimination. \n \n Let's not forget the all-important politics. Take a look at Republican control of congress (or lack of) during the 1950's and 1960s. LBJ was majority leader from 1955 until he was elected VP, then moved on to become president upon JFK's death and history will give him credit for the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

BS.\n \nIRAQ: PRIME MINISTER'S MEETING, 23 JULY\n \n Copy addressees and you met the Prime Minister on 23 July to discuss Iraq.\n \n This record is extremely sensitive. No further copies should be made. It should be shown only to those with a genuine need to know its contents.\n \n John Scarlett summarised the intelligence and latest JIC assessment. Saddam's regime was tough and based on extreme fear. The only way to overthrow it was likely to be by massive military action. Saddam was worried and expected an attack, probably by air and land, but he was not convinced that it would be immediate or overwhelming. His regime expected their neighbours to line up with the US. Saddam knew that regular army morale was poor. Real support for Saddam among the public was probably narrowly based.\n \n C reported on his recent talks in Washington. There was a perceptible shift in attitude. Military action was now seen as inevitable. Bush wanted to remove Saddam, through military action, justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD. But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy. The NSC had no patience with the UN route, and no enthusiasm for publishing material on the Iraqi regime's record. There was little discussion in Washington of the aftermath after military action.\n \n ...\n \n The Foreign Secretary said he would discuss this with Colin Powell this week. It seemed clear that Bush had made up his mind to take military action, even if the timing was not yet decided. But the case was thin. Saddam was not threatening his neighbours, and his WMD capability was less than that of Libya, North Korea or Iran. We should work up a plan for an ultimatum to Saddam to allow back in the UN weapons inspectors. This would also help with the legal justification for the use of force.\n \n ...\n \n The Prime Minister said that it would make a big difference politically and legally if Saddam refused to allow in the UN inspectors. Regime change and WMD were linked in the sense that it was the regime that was producing the WMD. There were different strategies for dealing with Libya and Iran. If the political context were right, people would support regime change. The two key issues were whether the military plan worked and whether we had the political strategy to give the military plan the space to work.\n \n\n full report \n \n 1. if Bush was to fix the report to show wmd exist when they did not, the report would have said\n \"Bush wanted to remove Saddam, through military action, justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD. And the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy.\" certainly the brits would be expected to use english properly.\n 2. the remainder of the report suggest a unanymity of agreement regarding iraq possessing wmd.\n 3. post war intelligence reviews in the US, UK, and Aus all showed there were no falsification of the intelligence. that they were just plain wrong. now if you think all three reports were \"fix\" in collusion with each other, i would suggest that its more likely the Nazi pope fixed them in preparation for his ascention as the pope anti-christ. emoticon_rolleyes\n 4. it is better to link to the actual report rather than someone's edited version.",
