   "Indeed. A quick study of history will reveal that there was no youth crime before video games were invented.\n \n emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n \n exactly. Do you think that before GTA came out that no kids ever went drag-racing? Do you think there was no violence back in the good ol' days before video games? I don't own any of the above-mentioned games but I have played GTA and Halo at friends' houses and they haven't driven me to want to kill someone. The original question was \"why make them?\" The answer is that people like to play the games and the sellers want to make money selling the game. I do own a couple other shooting games (none are rated M though) and I don't suddenly want to kill someone. These games are fantasy, they are just a game. Until a direct corelation can be shown between video games and violence (and they have to make sure the corelation isn't just because violent kids like violent video games, that wouldn't prove that the viedeo games were the cause of the violence), they should be sold to anyone who wants to buy them. \n \n I still say the movie rating system is pretty bad. Why was Star Wars III rated PG-13? I've seen R rated movies that have less violence than some PG-13 movies. And I heard the other day that the rule was for it to be PG-13 and not R you couldn't say the f word more than once and it couldn't be used as a verb. So kids 13-18 can hear the word once, but after that it's bad or something??? I still say keep the ratings system in place to inform parents but allow anyone willing to buy a ticket to buy one for any movie no matter what the rating, and the same with video games (although I think that's how it is in the US with video games).",

   "Oh I expect AI and other areas will advance apace as well.\n \n \n The next big thing in Computer Games is Hardware Accelerated Physics, this means that you will have a card that sits in your Computer and will do all Physics calculations for your games. \n This means that some of load will be taken off the CPU, so like what happened with 3D Graphics where the load was taken off the CPU and put onto a GPU, this allowed the programmer to use more of the CPU for things such as AI. Which led to more complex games.\n \n One of the big problems with game AI is that your are effectively faking Intelligence, I will give you an example from one of the projects I worked on at University.\n \n I was working on a car driving game, so we wanted to have cars in the game that acted like traffic. It was up to me to code the AI for those traffic cars, the way I went about the it was to create a system of waypoints around the city where a traffic car would follow. Now this might sound very simple but it was actually relatively complicated. What I first had to do was create a way that the AI could hold the list of waypoints, I decided on a queue structure. This meant that the next waypoint the AI was to go to was at the top of the queue structure, and when the AI reached that waypoint the top element would be removed from the queue and the next one would be the target waypoint.\n Then I had to think of a way to make the AI car steer towards the waypoint, what I had to do was create a vector between the car's current position and the waypoint position which represented the path the car should be on. Then I had to use the cars current direction vector and the path vector to calculate the angle for the car to steer.\n So really that car was not intelligent in any way it only held the next waypoints position, the car position and the car direction. It did not know the position of the player, or any other obstacles on the map.\n \n That is the thing the game programmers will go with the simple thing that gives the illusion of intelligence.\n \n \n\n And on the same note.. wouldn't it be better to, instead of letting the user's character to right away, make the character actually stay in the jail? They would see how boring it is, and thus lowering their will to do any real crimes.\n \n \n Games are an entertainment product, a game that actually sent the player's character to jail would make a very boring game. If it was a boring game then no one would buy it. So the moral message you would try to impart would not reach anyone.\n \n Anyway games are not there to teach the difference between right and wrong that is what parents are for, a game is just a diversion from reality allowing people to get away from things and escape into a fantasy world where anything goes. \n \n In game design, you always need to strike a balance between realism and fun. It always depends on what type of game you are going to produce. For example if you are creating a Flight Simulator you would make it as realistic as possible because that is what your target audience wants, but even then you do not have the game totally realistic as that would spoil the fun factor. Imagine if you flew 15 missions are you died when you crashed into a building the Flight Sim allows you to load an old saved game. If it was totally realistic you would have to start a new game.",

   "The criminal element always try to justify their actions. Blame their parents (\"I wasn't hugged enough\"), blame society (\"If you'd just give me a high-paying job for my lack of education I would not have to steal\"), or blame some media element (\"Violent games/movies/music caused me to do this\").\n \n Nope, not buying it. Don't remember too many 16-ton anvils being dropped on people after Looney Tunes was on. \n \n I've played Halo, and the uber-bouncy DOAx fighting game. Didn't make me want to jack a Humvee and go careening through the downtown.\n \n And these games have ratings on them. For the responsible parents that want to limit mature games being played the solution is simple. Do not allow your kid to play them!! Be a parent, not some lame, aged buddy.",

   "How about I use the example of infantry bayonet training, it uses a very simple simulation (dummies, bags of straw, targets etc) to harden people to sticking a knife into something, so that they won't think twice about it in a combat situation. If you play GTA or something similar, you could be said to be playing a simulation of actual theft murder et al, and hence, when presented with a particular situation, are likely to have fewer qualms about committing the immoral act. However, I'm just playing devil's advocate here, the difference in intent is crucial, infantrymen are AIMING to be able to kill someone with a bayonet, players of video games are not aiming to practise for acting out those event in real life, or if they are they have bigger problems than video games.\n\n \n Someone who can't tell the difference between a video game (using thumb to push buttons to control a vehicle on screen) and real life (having hands on a stearing wheel, foot on gas, feeling the change) has more problems than the games themselves. And even in the military, I've heard stories about how the soldiers were almost throwing up as they had to kill other people, and were inches from being killed themselves. Real life is different from video games and the dummy would not be a substitute either. The dummy is more realistic than a video game but still is no substitute for a real live person. I've played racing car games, and games where the object is to run from the cops and stuff. I got my permit 3 months ago and will get my driver's liscence soon. As of now I have yet to feel pressured to go in excess of the speed limit around cars on the median or travel the wrong way on a road to get somewhere faster. This also goes back to the parent, if a parent knows their kid can't tell the difference between a video game and life, they need to do something about it. But I would hope most people would be able to tell a difference between real life and a video game.",
