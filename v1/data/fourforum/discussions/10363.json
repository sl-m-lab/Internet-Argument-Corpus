Their sole purpose is to get through each day with enough to eat. Yes slowly but surely their children are being educated and becoming more aware. However, the whole process will take decades rather than getting an instant fix.\n \n Hopefully their path will be shorter than ours given the right help. That doesn't mean pouring in thousands/millions of pounds/dollars/euros which get diverted into various coffers. What is does mean is making life easier for people that is taking the pressure off them so they do have enough water food medical help and education.
