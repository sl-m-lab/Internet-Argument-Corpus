   "Are you talking processed or genetically modified? Or am I just being incredibly stupid and they are the same things?\n\n No, you're not being incredibly stupid. Don't worry about that.\n I mean processed food, like meats and cheeses. They have the word processed somewhere on the package. Or at least the should...\n (foods like the single slices of cheese, processed chicken and turkey slices, among other meats. - Lunchables as far as I know are made from all processed foods.. at least the ones I've seen. Just things like that)\n I'm also talking about refined products too, I guess. Like refined flours and sugars. Because of their added neutrients they're not completely bad, but they still cause problems. \n Most processed foods have high contents of saturated fats. \n Sources of 'Bad' fats: \n Butter\n Cheese\n Chips and crackers\n Cream \n Deep fried foods\n Fast-foods \n Fatty meats and sausages\n Full cream milk\n Many packaged and processed foods\n \n and this is why our parents tell us (hopefully) that whole grain bread is better than white...\n -------------------------------------------------------\n There are several problems with refined carbs. One is that Americans are eating too many of them and in portions that are too big. Marion Nestle, a professor who chairs the Department of Nutrition and Food Studies at New York University, says that foods made of processed grains and those with added sugars are key players in the super-sizing phenomenon.\n \n \"Just think about bagels, muffins, the size of potato chips packages, the size of snack food packages, the size of French fry portions in fast-food restaurants and (the size of) soft drinks in movie theaters,\" she says. \"One bagel is a quarter of the (recommended) caloric intake for one day for most people.\"\n \n Another problem is that it's easy to over-indulge in these foods because of what's inside them -- or not inside them. Ornish notes that that \"you can consume large amounts without getting full, since the fiber and bran (that make us feel full) were removed or were not present.\"\n ~http://www.brainerddispatch.com/stories/112203/hea_1122030030.shtml\n \n I'll add more later.",
