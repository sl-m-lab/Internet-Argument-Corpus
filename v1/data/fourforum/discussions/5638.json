All participants must be willing to be polite - you don't have to respect the other participants but you must register that disagreement politely. \n\n \n I try to do that, but if someone gets rude, I tend to get equally rude back. Do you think these forums would be better if, rather than responding to rudeness, one should abandon the thread as soon as his opponent gets rude? \n \n \n2. All participants must be willing and able to represent each other's positions fairly, to the satisfaction of whoever originally presented that particular position. \n\n \n Sometimes the original presentor is hard to satisfy.

   "I try to do that, but if someone gets rude, I tend to get equally rude back. Do you think these forums would be better if, rather than responding to rudeness, one should abandon the thread as soon as his opponent gets rude?\n No, I think that these forums would be better if people responded to rudeness with politeness. After all, why lower yourself to their level? Better to give people the benefit of the doubt rather than kill a thread with a flame-war.\n \nSometimes the original presentor is hard to satisfy. If person #2 can't represent person #1's position to his/her satisfaction, person #2 shouldn't automatically be presumed guilty.\n Since all participants must be fair and honest about each other's posts, I have difficulty seeing how one participant cannot represent another's position to that other's satisfaction. Once thing I've noticed is that people are lazy, after all this is entertainment, and aren't willing to do the work necessary to establish consensus and common ground. If both people are willing to help each other understand, and do the work that's involved, then satisfaction may be eventually achieved. \n \n I think that's one of the reasons that we see so many repetitive threads, because people aren't willing to go through a complete process of analysis - to keep going back looking for further articulation and explanation of an idea.\n \n \nAgreed, but who decides what is logical and what is emotional?\n The participants reach an agreement on it. It should be easy to agree on because logic is about how information relates to other information and emotion is how you feel about information. Logical key-words include \"or\", \"not\", \"and\", \"if/then\", \"if and only if\", \"therefore\", etc. \n \n \n An example:\n \n Logical: If I have a apple, and apples are fruit, then I have a fruit.\n \n Emotional: Apples make me happy.",
