   "Gibson says what all of us who were clear headed about the French knew all along. They were bought and paid for. This explains as best anything why Powell was so exorcized at the U.N. He was pulling that knife out of his back. \n \n The French are also at least indirectly responsible for the Iraq War. \n =================================\n \n The French Were on the Take\n \n Thursday, May 12, 2005\n \n By John Gibson\n \n Thursday, the French Senate - the one in France, which is that uppity country in Europe - was interrupted by a man who came to debate with no clothes on.\n \n \"Naked Man in French Senate,\" that was the slug. Tends to catch your eye.\n \n \"Man, I thought, that's perfect.\" The naked man was trying to protest the vote on the E.U. Constitution, which we don't really care about. But I'd like to declare this naked man a protest of something else.\n \n Here's what it is and I quote from a note FOX News' Eric Shawn sent to all of us Thursday on one of these fascinating new developments:\n \n \"The House Energy and Commerce Committee will reveal that the Iraqi intelligence service tried to target French politicians, including the possibility of supporting a French presidential candidate so they would support Saddam (search) and end sanctions.\n \n Memos show the Iraqis were promised by the spokesman for Chirac's campaign that France would veto any American decision regarding an attack on Iraq.\"\n \n In English, the French were on the take, they were being bribed by Saddam and they were willing to sell their U.N. Security Council veto to Saddam.\n \n That is why the French were threatening a veto before the Iraq war. Proof, documentation, memos - it wasn't possible to convince the French the war was right because the French were on the take.\n \n Well, gee, that puts a different light on it, doesn't it?\n \n Remember how a few of us were saying the U.N. debate on Iraq smelled distinctly like the fix was in?\n \n Remember during the early Oil-for-Food (search) days when a few of us were saying never mind Saddam stealing oil billions? It's the bribery, stupid, especially when it's bribing France to veto war against Iraq?\n \n Well, there it is: France was bribed. It was going to veto not because France hates war but because Saddam bought off a whole country.\n \n And you know what? It doesn't bother anybody over at the U.N. because that's how things are done...\n \n (Snip)\n \n http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,156406,00.html",

   "My son always blames his sister when he gets in trouble. I don't accept such whinning from him either.\n \n Here's the deal. You can't change that we didn't have a rationale or any acceptable evidence. So until our ducks are lined up, blaming the French our anyone else is whinning.\n \n Second, let's not forget that we knew about the smuggling, where most the money for Saddam came from in the 90's.\n \n \n\"The major source of external financial resources to the Iraqi regime,\" he reported, \"resulted from sanctions violations outside the [oil-for-food] programme's framework.\" These violations consisted of \"illicit sales\" of oil by the Iraqi regime to Turkey and Jordan. The members of the UN security council, including the United States, knew about them but did nothing. \"United States law requires that assistance programmes to countries in violation of UN sanctions be ended unless continuation is determined to be in the national interest. Such determinations were provided by successive United States administrations.\"\n \n The government of the US, in other words, though it had been informed about a smuggling operation which brought Saddam Hussein's regime some $4.6bn, decided to let it continue. It did so because it deemed the smuggling to be in its national interest, as it helped friendly countries (Turkey and Jordan) evade the sanctions on Iraq. The biggest source of illegal funds to Saddam Hussein was approved not by officials of the UN but by officials in the US. Strange to relate, neither Mr Hyde nor Mr Coleman have yet been bellyaching about it. But this isn't the half of it.\n \n It is true that the UN's auditing should have been better. Some of the oil-for-food money found its way into Saddam Hussein's hands. One of its officials, with the help of a British diplomat, helped to ensure that a contract went to a British firm, rather than a French one. The most serious case involves an official called Benon Sevan, who is alleged to have channelled Iraqi oil into a company he favoured, and who might have received $160,000 in return. Kofi Annan, the UN secretary general, has taken disciplinary action against both men, and promised to strip them of diplomatic immunity if they are charged. There could scarcely be a starker contrast to the way the US has handled the far graver allegations against its own officials.\n \n Four days before Volcker reported his findings about Saddam Hussein, the US inspector general for Iraq reconstruction published a report about the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) - the US agency which governed Iraq between April 2003 and June 2004. The inspector general's job is to make sure that the money the authority spent was properly accounted for. It wasn't. In just 14 months, $8.8bn went absent without leave. This is more than Mobutu Sese Seko managed to steal in 32 years of looting Zaire. It is 55,000 times as much as Mr Sevan is alleged to have been paid.\n \n The authority, the inspector general found, was \"burdened by severe inefficiencies and poor management\". This is kind. Other investigations suggest that it was also burdened by false accounting, fraud and corruption.\n \n Last week a British adviser to the Iraqi Governing Council told the BBC's File on Four programme that officials in the CPA were demanding bribes of up to $300,000 in return for awarding contracts. Iraqi money seized by US forces simply disappeared. Some $800m was handed out to US commanders without being counted or even weighed. A further $1.4bn was flown from Baghdad to the Kurdish regional government in the town of Irbil, and has not been seen since.\n \n Contracts to US companies were awarded by the CPA without any financial safeguards. They were issued without competition, in the form of \"cost-plus\" deals. This means that the companies were paid for the expenses they incurred, plus a percentage of those expenses in the form of profit. They had a powerful incentive, in other words, to spend as much money as possible. As a result, the authority appears to have obtained appalling value for money. Auditors at the Pentagon, for example, allege that, in the course of just one contract, a subsidiary of Halliburton overcharged it for imported fuel by $61m. This appears to have been officially sanctioned. In November, the New York Times obtained a letter from an officer in the US Army Corps of Engineers insisting that she would not \"succumb to the political pressures from the ... US embassy to go against my integrity and pay a higher price for fuel than necessary\". She was overruled by her superiors, who issued a memo insisting that the prices the company was charging were \"fair and reasonable\", and that it wouldn't be asked to provide the figures required to justify them.\n \n Other companies appear to have charged the authority for work they never did, or to have paid subcontractors to do it for them for a fraction of what they were paid by the CPA. Yet, even when confronted by cast-iron evidence of malfeasance, the authority kept employing them. When the inspector general recommended that the US army withhold payments from companies which appear to have overcharged it, it ignored him. No one has been charged or punished. The US department of justice refuses to assist the whistle-blowers who are taking these companies to court.\n \n http://www.guardian.co.uk/Columnists/Column/0,5673,1408187,00.html\n\n \n \n \n SO, some good old fashion self responsibility would go a long way.",
