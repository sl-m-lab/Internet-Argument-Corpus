   "Well, I'm surprised at the sheer lack of hubbub surrounding voting irregularities. Well, maybe they shouldn't be called irregularities because this sort of thing isn't that irregular. So anyway, here are the few stories related to voting counts and how they got screwed up.\n \n http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/1106-30.htm\n \nSo far, the only national \"mainstream\" media to come close to this story was Keith Olbermann on his show Friday night, November 5th, when he noted that it was curious that all the voting machine irregularities so far uncovered seem to favor Bush. In the meantime, the Washington Post and other media are now going through single-bullet-theory-like contortions to explain how the exit polls had failed.\n\n \n http://apnews.myway.com/article/20041105/D865R1DO0.html\n \nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - An error with an electronic voting system gave President Bush 3,893 extra votes in suburban Columbus, elections officials said.\n \n Franklin County's unofficial results had Bush receiving 4,258 votes to Democrat John Kerry's 260 votes in a precinct in Gahanna. Records show only 638 voters cast ballots in that precinct.\n\n \n http://www.guardian.co.uk/worldlatest/story/0,1280,-4598911,00.html\n \n``We had an election on Nov. 2 that fell outside the zone of litigation,'' said Patrick Merloe, an attorney and human rights activist who has observed elections in 27 countries. ``That does not mean we had an election that met acceptable standards.''\n\n \n http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/content/shared/news/politics/stories/11/05flavote.html\n \nIt turns out the software used in Broward County can handle only 32,000 votes per precinct. After that, the system starts counting backward. Why a voting system would ever be designed to vote backward was a mystery to Broward County Mayor Ilene Lieberman. It had her on the phone late Wednesday with Omaha-based Elections Systems and Software.\n\n \n http://www.wsoctv.com/news/3892151/detail.html\n \nJacksonville, N.C. -- More than 4,500 Carteret County votes have been lost because officials believed a computer that stored ballots electronically could hold more data than it did.\n \n Scattered other problems may change results in local races around the state.\n \n Carteret officials said UniLect Corp., the maker of the county's electronic voting system, said each storage unit could handle 10,500 votes, but the limit was actually 3,005 votes. When they tried to store more than 7,500 early votes in the unit, some 4,530 were lost. Jack Gerbel, president and owner of Dublin-Calif.-based UniLect, told The Associated Press on Thursday that the county's elections board was given incorrect information. There is no way to retrieve the missing data, he said. \"That is the situation and it's definitely terrible,\" he said. In a letter to county officials, he blamed the mistake on confusion over which model of the voting machines were in use in Carteret County. But he also noted that the machines flash a warning message when there is no more room for storing ballots. \"Evidently, this message was either ignored or overlooked,\" he wrote.\n\n \n http://www.wired.com/news/evote/0,2645,65623,00.html\n \nThe congressmen, Democratic members of the House of Representatives from Florida, New York and Michigan, cited a number of incidents that came to light in the days after the election. One was a glitch in Ohio that caused a memory card reader made by Danaher Controls to give George W. Bush 3,893 more votes than he should have received.\n \n Reports from voters in Florida and Ohio also indicated that some of them had problems voting for the candidate of their choice. When they tried to vote for John Kerry, they said, the machine either wouldn't register the vote at all or would indicate on the review page that the vote was cast for Bush instead.\n\n And these are just the problems that people caught. What about all the other problems that weren't?\n \n Then go to:\n http://www.votergate.tv/\n http://www.blackboxvoting.org/\n http://www.blackboxvoting.com/\n \n \n Ok, let's just forget who won and who lost for a minute and step back from this. This is just pathetic. I can hear old Ross Perot now. \"That's just sad, see.\" \n \n If we are supposed to be the harbingers of democracy, spreading it throughout the world on the depleted uranium tips of armor-piercing ammunition, then why the hell can't we get it right?",

Maybe we should look to other countries that have a more open system, and one that can actually count votes, and try to emulate them, and learn from them.

This leaves a discrepancy of 88,408 votes cast for the presidential candidates.\n \n Vote discrepancies were also found in Gahanna, Ohio which gave an extra 4,000 votes to President Bush. The error was explained away by Franklin County administrators as a \"glitch\" in the electronic voting system.\n\n \n http://www.wowt.com/news/headlines/1161971.html\n \nElection officials say they don't believe the glitch will impact who won and who lost any of the races. They figure that when votes were doubled in a particular race, the totals were doubled for both candidates. Vote totals would be skewed but percentages would not change.\n\n \n http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&address=104x2598159\n \"More votes than voters: Now THAT'S a mandate!\"\n \n http://www.washingtondispatch.com/article_10500.shtml\n \nIn one voting precinct in Gahanna, Ohio, 4,258 voters supposedly cast an electronic ballot for George Bush while only 260 voted for John Kerry. While it is vaguely possible that over 94% of voters in the precinct supported George W. Bush, it is a hard number to believe considering that only 638 voters were counted at the polling center. \n \n In Florida, exit polling data showed the opposite of the final results provided through the state. Even more surprising are the changes in votes per party that occurred on November 2nd. Counties using e-touch voting machines in Florida showed an average vote gain of 29% for Republicans and a 23.8% increase for Democrats. However the counties that used optical scan vote machines showed drastic differences. Republicans gained by 128.45% in counties using optical scan voting machines while Democrats had a -21% loss (yes, that is negative 21%). Some districts in Florida showed gains of over 400% while one, Liberty County, gained over 700% for Republicans.\n\n \n http://www.tompaine.com/articles/kerry_won.php\n \nKerry won. Here's the facts.\n \n I know you don't want to hear it. You can't face one more hung chad. But I don't have a choice. As a journalist examining that messy sausage called American democracy, it's my job to tell you who got the most votes in the deciding states. Tuesday, in Ohio and New Mexico, it was John Kerry.\n \n Most voters in Ohio thought they were voting for Kerry. CNN's exit poll showed Kerry beating Bush among Ohio women by 53 percent to 47 percent. Kerry also defeated Bush among Ohio's male voters 51 percent to 49 percent. Unless a third gender voted in Ohio, Kerry took the state.\n \n So what's going on here? Answer: the exit polls are accurate. Pollsters ask, \"Who did you vote for?\" Unfortunately, they don't ask the crucial, question, \"Was your vote counted?\" The voters don't know.\n \n Here's why. Although the exit polls show that most voters in Ohio punched cards for Kerry-Edwards, thousands of these votes were simply not recorded. This was predictable and it was predicted. [See TomPaine.com, \"An Election Spoiled Rotten,\" November 1.]\n \n Once again, at the heart of the Ohio uncounted vote game are, I'm sorry to report, hanging chads and pregnant chads, plus some other ballot tricks old and new.\n\n \n Here is a page full of links to other articles:\n http://pages.ivillage.com/americans4america/id11.html\n \n like: http://newsobserver.com/news/nc/ncwire_news/story/1799589p-8100001c.html\n \nMore than 3,200 votes were removed from results released Tuesday after Republicans pointed out a discrepancy in early voting totals: more ballots than voters.

   "http://www.commondreams.org/views04/1118-22.htm\n \n \n \nPublished on Thursday, November 18, 2004 by CommonDreams.org\n 'Stinking Evidence' of Possible Election Fraud Found in Florida\n by Thom Hartmann\n \n \n There was something odd about the poll tapes.\n \n A \"poll tape\" is the phrase used to describe a printout from an optical scan voting machine made the evening of an election, after the machine has read all the ballots and crunched the numbers on its internal computer. It shows the total results of the election in that location. The printout is signed by the polling officials present in that precinct/location, and then submitted to the county elections office as the official record of how the people in that particular precinct had voted. (Usually each location has only one single optical scanner/reader, and thus produces only one poll tape.)\n \n Bev Harris of www.blackboxvoting.org, the erstwhile investigator of electronic voting machines, along with people from Florida Fair Elections, showed up at Florida's Volusia County Elections Office on the afternoon of Tuesday, November 16, 2004, and asked to see, under a public records request, each of the poll tapes for the 100+ optical scanners in the precincts in that county. The elections workers - having been notified in advance of her request - handed her a set of printouts, oddly dated November 15 and lacking signatures.\n \n Bev pointed out that the printouts given her were not the original poll tapes and had no signatures, and thus were not what she'd requested. Obligingly, they told her that the originals were held in another location, the Elections Office's Warehouse, and that since it was the end of the day they should meet Bev the following morning to show them to her.\n \n Bev showed up bright and early the morning of Wednesday the 17th - well before the scheduled meeting - and discovered three of the elections officials in the Elections Warehouse standing over a table covered with what looked like poll tapes. When they saw Bev and her friends, Bev told me in a telephone interview less than an hour later, \"They immediately shoved us out and slammed the door.\"\n \n In a way, that was a blessing, because it led to the stinking evidence.\n \n \"On the porch was a garbage bag,\" Bev said, \"and so I looked in it and, and lo and behold, there were public record tapes.\"\n \n Thrown away. Discarded. Waiting to be hauled off.\n \n \"It was technically stinking, in fact,\" Bev added, \"because what they had done was to have thrown some of their polling tapes, which are the official records of the election, into the garbage. These were the ones signed by the poll workers. These are something we had done an official public records request for.\"\n \n When the elections officials inside realized that the people outside were going through the trash, they called the police and one came out to challenge Bev.\n \n Kathleen Wynne, a www.blackboxvoting.org investigator, was there.\n \n \"We caught the whole thing on videotape,\" she said. \"I don't think you'll ever see anything like this - Bev Harris having a tug of war with an election worker over a bag of garbage, and he held onto it and she pulled on it, and it split right open, spilling out those poll tapes. They were throwing away our democracy, and Bev wasn't going to let them do it.\"\n \n As I was interviewing Bev just moments after the tussle, she had to get off the phone, because, \"Two police cars just showed up.\"\n \n She told me later in the day, in an on-air interview, that when the police arrived, \"We all had a vigorous debate on the merits of my public records request.\"\n \n The outcome of that debate was that they all went from the Elections Warehouse back to the Elections Office, to compare the original, November 2 dated and signed poll tapes with the November 15 printouts the Elections Office had submitted to the Secretary of State. A camera crew from www.votergate.tv met them there, as well.\n \n And then things got even odder.\n \n \"We were sitting there comparing the real [signed, original] tapes with the [later printout] ones that were given us,\" Bev said, \"and finding things missing and finding things not matching, when one of the elections employees took a bin full of things that looked like garbage - that looked like polling tapes, actually - and passed by and disappeared out the back of the building.\"\n \n This provoked investigator Ellen Brodsky to walk outside and check the garbage of the Elections Office itself. Sure enough - more original, signed poll tapes, freshly trashed.\n \n \"And I must tell you,\" Bev said, \"that whatever they had taken out [the back door] just came right back in the front door and we said, 'What are these polling place tapes doing in your dumpster?'\"\n \n A November 18 call to the Volusia County Elections Office found that Elections Supervisor Deanie Lowe was unavailable and nobody was willing to speak on the record with an out-of-state reporter. However, The Daytona Beach News (in Volusia County), in a November 17th article by staff writer Christine Girardin, noted, \"Harris went to the Department of Elections' warehouse on State Road 44 in DeLand on Tuesday to inspect original Nov. 2 polling place tapes, after being given a set of reprints dated Nov. 15. While there, Harris saw Nov. 2 polling place tapes in a garbage bag, heightening her concern about the integrity of voting records.\"\n \n The Daytona Beach News further noted that, \"[Elections Supervisor] Lowe confirmed Wednesday some backup copies of tapes from the Nov. 2 election were destined for the shredder,\" but pointed out that, according to Lowe, that was simply because there were two sets of tapes produced on election night, each signed. \"One tape is delivered in one car along with the ballots and a memory card,\" the News reported. \"The backup tape is delivered to the elections office in a second car.\"\n \n Suggesting that duplicates don't need to be kept, Lowe claims that Harris didn't want to hear an explanation of why some signed poll tapes would be in the garbage. \"She's not wanting to listen to an explanation,\" Lowe told the News of Harris. \"She has her own ideas.\"\n \n But the Ollie North action in two locations on two days was only half of the surprise that awaited Bev and her associates. When they compared the discarded, signed, original tapes with the recent printouts submitted to the state and used to tabulate the Florida election winners, Harris says a disturbing pattern emerged.\n \n \"The difference was hundreds of votes in each of the different places we examined,\" said Bev, \"and most of those were in minority areas.\"\n \n When I asked Bev if the errors they were finding in precinct after precinct were random, as one would expect from technical, clerical, or computer errors, she became uncomfortable.\n \n \"You have to understand that we are non-partisan,\" she said. \"We're not trying to change the outcome of an election, just to find out if there was any voting fraud.\"\n \n That said, Bev added: \"The pattern was very clear. The anomalies favored George W. Bush. Every single time.\"\n \n Of course finding possible voting \"anomalies\" in one Florida county doesn't mean they'll show up in all counties. It's even conceivable there are innocent explanations for both the mismatched counts and trashed original records; this story undoubtedly will continue to play out. And, unless further investigation demonstrates a pervasive and statewide trend toward \"anomalous\" election results in many of Florida's counties, odds are none of this will change the outcome of the election (which exit polls showed John Kerry winning in Florida).\n \n Nonetheless, Bev and her merry band are off to hit another county.\n \n As she told me on her cell phone while driving toward their next destination, \"We just put Volusia County and their lawyers on notice that they need to continue to keep a number of documents under seal, including all of the memory cards to the ballot boxes, and all of the signed poll tapes.\"\n \n Why?\n \n \"Simple,\" she said. \"Because we found anomalies indicative of fraud.\" \n",

   "http://www.truthout.org/docs_04/121604Z.shtml\n \nMr. Chairman, though our time is limited, I must bring to the committee's attention the most recent and perhaps most troubling incident that was related to my campaign on Sunday, December 12, about a shocking event that occurred last Friday, December 10.\n \n A representative from Triad Systems came into a county board of elections office un-announced. He said he was just stopping by to see if they had any questions about the up-coming recount. He then headed into the back room where the Triad supplied Tabulator (a card reader and older PC with custom software) is kept. He told them there was a problem and the system had a bad battery and had \"lost all of its data\". He then took the computer apart and started swapping parts in and out of it and another \"spare\" tower type PC also in the room. He may have had spare parts in his coat as one of the BOE people moved it and remarked as to how very heavy it was. He finally re-assembled everything and said it was working but to not turn it off.\n \n He then asked which precinct would be counted for the 3% recount test, and the one which had been selected as it had the right number of votes, was relayed to him. He then went back and did something else to the tabulator computer.\n \n The Triad Systems representative suggested that since the hand count had to match the machine count exactly, and since it would be hard to memorize the several numbers which would be needed to get the count to come out exactly right, that they should post this series of numbers on the wall where they would not be noticed by observers. He suggested making them look like employee information or something similar. The people doing the hand count could then just report these numbers no matter what the actual count of the ballots revealed. This would then \"match\" the tabulator report for this precinct exactly. The numbers were apparently the final certified counts for the selected precinct.\n \n Triad is contracted to do much of the elections work in this county and elsewhere in Ohio. This included programming the candidates into the tabulator, and coming up with the rotation of candidates in the various precincts (that is, the order of which candidate is first changes between precincts). They also have a technician in the office on election night to actually run the tabulator itself.\n \n Triad also supplies the network computers on which all of the voter registration information and processing is kept for the county.\n \n It was unusual for the computers to be taken apart. At least one member of the Board of Elections was told the tabulator was in pieces when he called to check on the office.\n \n The source of this report believes that the Triad representative was \"making the rounds\" of visiting other counties also before the recount. This person also stated they would not pass on the suggestion of the \"posted\" hidden totals, and would refuse to go along with it if it were suggested by the others in the office at the time.\n \n The source of this information believes they could lose their job if they come forward. \n\n \n http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0451/perlstein.php\n \nThe national elections may-we can't prove it yet, but there's every indication -be completely crooked,\" says Wayne Tack, an activist in Chicago. \"And the consequence of that is, in the next election cycle, the Republicans have a filibuster-proof majority. The election cycle after that, a two-thirds majority in both houses, and the possibility of a two-thirds majority in two-thirds of the states. Then you can amend the Constitution every week.\" He adds, \"Based on the lockdown thing, I would leave the country right now.\"\n \n By \"lockdown thing,\" he's referring to one of the vote fraud community's b\u00eates noires, and a useful index of its culture. On December 10, two California volunteers took upon themselves independent investigation of suspiciously low voter turnout in three precincts abutting a black college in rural Greene County, Ohio. When they asked to copy those precincts' signature books-ordinarily public records open to anyone who asks-the clerk called the Secretary of State's office. She was told that these records, for the time being, were \"locked down.\" \n\n \n http://www.ilcaonline.org/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=1326&mode=thread&order=0&thold=0\n \nFor that matter, how many Americans are aware that there is a recount underway in Ohio? That some counties are complying with the requirements of the recount while others are not? That Ohio's electors have cast their votes for Bush regardless of the fact that the votes are still being counted? That the U.S. Congress is expected to take up the matter of the 2004 election on January 6th, and that numerous House Members and probably some Senators will challenge the results?\n \n \"The corporate media would like us to concentrate on our holiday shopping,\" Fishgold said. \"The labor media has a responsibility to make information known that is critical to the health of our democracy. The ILCA is using its website at ILCAonline.org to help, and the ILCA supports the January 3rd and 6th rallies.\"\n\n \n http://www.gp.org/press/pr_2004_12_20.html\n \nThe recount of Ohio's presidential vote is being conducted in violation of the spirit and letter of Ohio law, according to numerous reports filed by official observers for the Green Party's presidential campaign, which initiated the recount and is monitoring its process.\n\n \n http://www.wired.com/news/evote/0,2645,66072,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_3\n \nAs a statewide election recount got underway in Ohio last week, a Democratic congressman called on the FBI to impound vote-tabulating computers in at least one county and investigate suspicions of election tampering in the state.\n\n \n http://www.elitestv.com/pub/2004/Dec/EEN41c754d14d6d9.html\n \nIf Ohio Secretary of State Blackwell's office is under the impression that the local county election boards are going to back up Blackwell's assertion that everything went well with Ohio's Presidential election, they are mistaken.\n\n \n http://www.elitestv.com/pub/2004/Dec/EEN41c7071285fd1.html\n \n'Recount? What recount? Are you talking about the new election in the Ukraine?' If you ask the average person on Main Street, USA about 'The Recount', that is the answer you are likely to get, if the person is even aware of the Ukraine election turmoil. If you then follow-up with asking them if they know about the Ohio recount, they will probably ask you what is being recounted. Such is the situation with the press' reporting of this important concluding event in the US Presidential election. \n\n \n http://www.freep.com/news/nw/ohio16e_20041216.htm\n \nA Detroit congressman asked the FBI on Wednesday to investigate an Ohio election worker's concern that presidential election results could have been altered when a software company employee worked on machines before a ballot recount.\n \n The company, TRIAD Governmental Systems Inc., provides vote-counting software used in 41 of Ohio's 88 counties.\n \n Rep. John Conyers, the senior Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, sent a letter to the FBI office in Cincinnati and Hocking County Prosecutor Larry Beal asking them to immediately confiscate election machinery in the southwest Ohio county.\n \n Conyers wants an FBI investigation because election tampering is a federal crime.\n",
