   "Well, saying you are proud to be American is neither supporting nor disagreeing with the president. To say, in a foreign country, to foreign nationals, that they are ashamed of the president (or that he comes from their state) is certainly one way to gain popularity in said country.\n \n\n But also, Toby Keith was talking about how proud he was to be an American to gain popularity as well. It also wouldn't gain popularity to go against the opinion of most Americans. I believe this was honest opinion. I believe this too. Bush is a discrace to our country in foreign affairs. He goes to the UN asking for help but also says he's just going to attack anyway. This puts out a horrible image and they were saying that that's not really what America or even Texas is really like.\n \n \n\n Of course I support the right of the Dixie Chicks to spew whatever garbage they want to. I feel (note, this is my opinion and I have no proof) that they were doing so in order to sell a few more records to some people who don't give a **** about their politics, anyway! I will say that they are sellouts and if they are ashamed of the President, they are welcome to say so, just don't get upset when your REAL fan base- the ones from your own  country- are turned off by your statements. that's what happened to them. By the way, their song \"Travelling Soldier\" was awesome. I still say that they are great musicians- they sing and play and, from what I've heard, entertain very well. But they made their political bed and really have no one to blame for their misfortune than themselves. Most country music fans are quite patriotic, I guess.\n \n\n Yes, I agree. There was talk of boycotting their concert but I guess people liked their music too much to not see the concert. There wasn't an empty seat. Of course it's your right to boycott them and think that they're a bunch of sellouts.\n \n \n\n As far as Double Standards:\n \n How is it a double standard? Does being patriotic make me a Republican? At no time does toby Kieth say in any of his songs, \"We'll put a boot in your A$$, 'cause we support the president heart and soul.\" And suporting the troops doesn't mean you support everything the president does. Don't you supprt our troops? I do. I don't necessarily agree 100% with Pres Bush, though.\n \n\n Patriotic has nothing to do with Republican. But Toby Keith is making a statement about th US. We'll put a boot in your @$$ it's the American way. It's not the American way. Politics isn't just about the president. This is stating his opinion. The point is he's allowed to state his opinion (we'll put a boot in your @$$, freedom don't come free, support our troops) but the Dixie Chicks aren't allowed to state theirs. That's called a double standard.",

I simply said they are a bunch of liberal wenches, that talked trash about our president during a time of war. Toby never did that. He never said he supported or opposed the president. And YES It IS  the American way to take care of business! The terrorists attacked us and only an appeasement preacher like carter, or clinton would NOT have done what our cowboy (I'll admit he is somewhat of a maverick) president did. And I hope that if there is ever another attack of that magnitude that whomever is the president at the time has the cojones to do what Bush did.",

It sounds like Whoopi to me, but I suppose it could apply to Linda Rondstadt as well. Just a point about both of these women: yes they have free speech rights but they have no right to expect approval for their views. In the case of Whoopi I think a little perspective is in order here. If Slimfast is concerned that her behavior makes her a business risk, what do you expect them to do? They didn't make her a spokesperson out of some charitible impulse. They believed she could sell their product. Apparently they are not of that opinion any longer. What can I say?",
