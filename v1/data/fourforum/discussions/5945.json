How can you justify that in reality? \n \n You claim to have no problem with homosexuals that don't have sex. \n \n How is that different than me saying I have no problem with blacks - until they listen to rap music, speak in ebonics, and kick my butt at basketball, then I can't tolerate them, it's a moral issue. \n \n Is that a moral issue I have with blacks? If not, why? The Bible? I'm sure I could find more than a few verses that could be \"interpreted\" to support my assertion.\n \n Is that position superior to saying that I don't like blacks regardless of their actions simply because they're black? According to your line of reasoning re homosexuality, it is. IMHO, that's an absurd assertion.\n \n You stated that predjudice is about \"the person and qualities about that person that aren't liked (skin color for instance)\". How is that any different than the quality of being attracted to the same sex or having limp wrists? IF homosexuality has a genetic component (I believe it does, I know you don't, but let's not get into that debate here), then how is it any different than skin colour.
