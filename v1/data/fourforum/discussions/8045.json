   "ok, well the reason I asked this was basically my English teacher doesn't seem to know what she's doing. Like seriously she seems like she makes half the stuff on the spot.

She told me \"no, they have to look the same\". Now I knew that was complete BS. I didn't know if she was right or not about it being incorrect, but I know of no gramatical rule that has anything to do with \"looking\" the same.

   "\"He likes to swim, skateboard, and go swimming.\"\n \n One problem may be a missing \"to\" before skateboard and \"go swimming\".\n \n The comma before \"and\" is required by Warriner's English Grammar from the 1980s, but when I was in grade school during the 1970s this comma was not needed and I used Warriner's only in the 7th grade (1981-1982). A comma before the \"and\" that connects a last item to a series may be more a matter of style than grammar. I don't use it because I was not taught to use it. \n \n The sentence is also badly written. \"To swim\" and \"go swimming\" are redundant. But, when you want to use multiple verbs it's best to keep them in the same form: \"He likes swimming, skateboarding and swimming.\" The original version mixes verb infinitives and participles, so it sounds awkward; use all infinitives or all participles.",
