   "The US has sacrified much in its largely one-sided support for Israel - mainly in its standing in the Middle East in how it is viewed in Arab society. The animosity felt against the US with its support of Israel fuels a large part of the Arab anger that leads to terrorism. It is only fair, then, to ask - what does the US gain from this alliance? Is there anything that Israel has done for us? This is an important question. I can predict a flood of responses saying that Israeli supporters in the US fund political campaigns and that any politician that doesn't show full support for Israel gets attacked by the Anti-Defamation league and organized against politically. All that is understood. However, is that really all there is? I have also heard comments that a Democratically stable Israel in the Middle East helps stabilize the region. This argument also never quite made sense. How, SPECIFICALLY, does that happen? The only reason I can think of is that corrupt leaders in many Middle Eastern countries can divert Arab anger from their own internal problems to the Arab-Israeli conflict. Either way, my main question is: What important and positive benefit does the US gain from its alliance with Israel?",

   "Well, having a firm ally right in striking range of the oil fields seems like a good idea. Especially since it's the exception in having a far more western style of culture than the other neighbours.\n\n I can see how, in a worst case scenario, that could be a possibility - i.e. either using Israeli bases to launch US combat flights or having the Israelis as allies in a fight against a particular Middle Eastern country. However, using such an option in a non-worst-case situation could create more problems than it solves since it links the US even more with the hated Israel and could turn a simmering hatred of the US into war-like antagonism by bistanding Middle Eastern countries. Indeed, our somewhat one-sided alliance with Israel might make it more likely for a worst-case scenario to crop up than if we were not allied. \n \n All that being said, I do believe that Israel has the right to exist and would support helping out Israel militarily if that survival was actually threatened. However, I find it quite frustrating that we continue to give aid to Israel seemingly unconditionally. I think our aid should be contingent on them making real strides in the Middle East peace process and, at the minimum, stop new settlements being built in the West Bank and start to dismantle the old ones.",

   "Support for Israel harms the image, economy and security of the United States.\n 1) Israel has a very aggressive foreign policy. U.S. supporting Israel, it supports a policy of aggression. When American politicians say that they want peace and security in the world, people all over the world see the U.S. supports the Israeli aggression and realize that American politicians lie to them. When American politicians say they want to protect the human rights of people around the world see how Israel is violating human rights in the Middle East and that the U.S. supports Israel, and understand that the American politicians lie. America, no one will believe, until it supports Israel. The entire world understands that Israel is using force on the U.S. for its inhuman actions. For all that makes Israel, the U.S. bears responsibility.\n 2) Israel feed from the U.S., like mosquito extract of the U.S. economy money.\n 3) Israel, his anti-Islamic policies worsen the already difficult relations between the U.S. and Muslim countries. These countries are very promising in the development, as have the vast natural resources, high fertility rates in the future will give them an enormous human potential. After 50 years of the Islamic world will have enormous power - more than China and India. Incur hatred of the Islamic world - suicide.",

   "These stereotypes.\n Consider, for example, Russia and the Muslims living in it. What do you know about them? Perhaps you know the only Chechnya and the military conflict there. But Chechnya - this is only 800 thousand people, and in Russia 20 million indigenous Muslims. What do you know about the other 19,200 thousand people? Probably nothing.\n Because of the news does not show a peaceful life, work and study. It is trite and not interested. Show violence, murder, weapons, disaster - is interested, it is frightening, it is remembered. So make up the stereotypes.\n \n However, the issue is not about that. The relationship between Israel and the United States. I am interested to know your opinion. As for the United States cheaper - to have good relations with 7 million citizens of Israel or the 1400 million Muslims?

   "Dude, re-read the OP.\n \n The issue we're discussing is the MIDDLE EAST.\n A region of tribal warfare and countries created by post-war victors with the INTENTIONS of destabalizing the region.\n \n Israel assists in that agenda.\n \n You tossing in 'Muslims' into a discussion on Middle east politics is asinine and idiotic. \n Yet, I rose to your bait and simply pointed out that those you mentioned also assist in local destabilisation.\n It's a cynical and machivallian attitude. It's much easier to keep your potential emenies DOWN than it is to elevate yourself.\n \n The US supports Israel because it becomes the focus point for 'most' of the middle east rage.\n That's why we got all upset and prissy when OBL circumnavigated them and directly attacked the US on 9/11.\n \n What I want to know is why Muslims in the area can't simply settle down, IGNORE Israel and get on with trying to live peacefully and using their energy to prosper...OH, that's right. Because this also works in reverse. The ruling parties, rather than work to elevate their people and improve their own countries would rather oppress their people and then blame it all on the evil zionists. Not your fault for anything if you have a handy scapegoat there to pin all the blame on.\n \n It's sooo funny watching people get in a tiff over a small sliver of land (Israel) with just a few people on it (7 million). If 1400 million Muslims are idiotic enough to get upset over a gnat...and can't do anything about it...I wonder how upset they'd be with something more 'annoying'.\n \n \n Personally, I think US policy should be to drain off every last resource of the region and then wipe all the people out...ALL. \n 'Jusice for Just Us'...or rather 'Just U.S.'\n \n \n But, if you did real bean counting, you'd realise it IS cheaper to support the Israeli's than to do what you and other liberals think.\n Which is why we do it.",

Currently one would NOT be beneficial. Maybe if they embraced moderation and dropped their evangelical nature one would probably kick arse.\n I just don't see how such an alliance would work in the long term when they produce radicals who think it's okay to strap bombs to themselves when ever they get irrate and tend to have a penchant for shoving their nonsensical beliefs down other peopls thoats.\n That's something those Jews don't tend to do.\n \n Nope, I think the western world tends to see them as useful tools once in a blue moon and a dangerous, back-stabbing enemy the rest of the time. \n See, supporting the Jews is a good idea. Yeah they take a lot of money from us but don't really reproduce like rabbits.\n \n That...and the Jews tend to have already spent a billion years slowly working to control the world and secretly dictating what happens.\n Yeah...them pesky Jews.
