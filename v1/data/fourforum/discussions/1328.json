   "I don't think that asking whether homosexuality is bad is the right question. Female/female intimacy I really think is a totally different phenomenon than male/male intimacy. I have no problem with the former, and as for the latter, it disgusts me not because it involves homosexuality, but because (as typically defined when using the term homosexual) it involves sodomy, by which I mean behavior that introduces semen into the digestive system. \n \n I'd say that the average person is rather disgusted by sodomy. Male homosexuals want to make their behavior seem primarily a gender-preference issue as opposed to a question of whether people should have the right to sodomize. Sodomy is not a pretty picture to most people. \n \n In the nineteenth-century, standard opinion was that sodomy was an immoral addiction. Thus, the anti-sodomy laws that existed in all the states. Here is the opinion of Charles MacKay, in his Extraordinary Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, on how sodomy helped James I to be screwed-up:\n \n \"Robert Kerr, a Scottish youth, was early taken notice of by James I., and loaded with honours, for no other reason that the world could ever discover than the beauty of his person. James, even in his own day, was suspected of being addicted to the most abominable of all offences; and the more we examine the history now, the stronger the suspicion becomes. However that may be, the handsome Kerr, lending his smooth cheek even in public to the disgusting kisses of his royal master, rose rapidly in favour. In the year 1613, he was made Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, and created an English peer by the style and title of Viscount Rochester. Still further honours were in store of him.\"\n \n This view of James I's homosexuality having been standard perhaps also explains why many of the anti-sodomy laws in England (can't remember where I read this) date from the Cromwellian period of English history. Indeed, the sentiment that led to the English Civil War started as a reaction to the decadence of James I (the father of the similar Charles I, whom the Roundheads beheaded).\n \n Just a few of the reasons it seems reasonable to me to view sodomy as a likely enslaving addiction:\n \n 1. Semen contains chemicals that could well be addictive. For instance, human seminal vesicles produce more E- and F- type prostaglandins than the rest of the body combined. Many of these are known to be important neuromodulators, affecting mood. Moreover, there has been some evidence that increased PGE levels in particular are associated with the narcosis of alcohol addiction. (A study was done by Gregory I. Elmer and Frank R. George showing that drunk supine rats who were given PGE inhibitors were able to right themselves quicker than other drunk rats, and it is also well known that alcohol temporarily increases PGE levels in the brain.) Apparently, accordingly to Dr. Lani Burkman, semen (like chocolate) also contains anandamide, the neurotransmitter whose receptors marijuana affects to produce its high. It is true that the chemistry of addiction is very poorly understood (in fact, alcohol addiction is not even understood well), but given that sodomy happens, that semen contains chemicals which have (poorly understood) effects on the brain suggestive of addiction, and that males have quite an evolutionary advantage in addicting females into wanting to have sex with them, it would I think to anyone stepping back and looking dispassionately at the situation in fact be surprising if sodomy were not chemically addictive.\n \n 2. Semen contains chemicals that could increase the terror with which concomitant physical abuse is viewed, thereby increasing the power of the abuser to gain domination over his victim. Indeed, aspirin and similar analgesics work to block sensitivity to pain by blocking prostaglandin E2, which exists copiously in semen. Since men are often physically abusive in relationships, it is reasonable to suppose that semen contains these pain-sensitizing algesics because these abusive men have an evolutionary advantage to their abuse being especially terrifyingly controlling. Algesics such as PGE2 in semen supports the notion that sodomy is about enslavement.\n \n 3. The recognized female erogenous zones, namely the clitoris and the G-spot, are located anteriorly in the female sexual apparatus. Presumably, males who hate sodomy do from fear of putting a square peg into a round hole so to speak, tend to be anterior when having sex, trying to make sex as far away from sodomy as possible. If sodomy is addictive, it is clear that females would evolve to be sexually aroused by sex that in its particulars suggests it was desired by her own nature as opposed to just adventitiously as a result of having been sodomized, so sodomy being addictive furnishes an explanation for the locations of the female erogenous zones.\n \n 4 A distinguishing characteristic of mammals (with very few exceptions) is that they have separate openings for the terminus of the digestive system and the reproductive system. An obvious explanation for why this characteristic (otherwise rather disadvantageous as requiring the products of the kidneys to be dissolved in water, which is not always easy to come by) evolved is that in cloacal animals (such as reptiles) sex itself is substantially addictive much as sodomy is addictive in mammals, and clearly sexual selection is harmed by sex being addictive. This would help explain why, on the whole, mammals have done as well as they have.\n \n 5. Paleontology suggests that in human evolution, upright stance evolved prior to increased brain size. This was surprising to scientists, who thought upright stance became useful only after man became smart enough to make and use tools, thereby requiring him to have freer use of the hands. A simple explanation given by the addictiveness of sodomy is that hominid females are more protected from sodomy if they have sex from the front as opposed to the back, and upright stance encourages sex from the front. Protection from sodomy leads to meaningful sexual selection, which leads to increased selection for intellectual qualities.\n \n 6. Biology suggests that sodomy would be more addictive than sex. Histology tells us that the rectum, unlike the vagina, is lined by simple epithelial tissue, the sort of tissue commonly associated with absorbing chemicals well. Also, much of the venous system from the rectum (unlike the venous system from most of the rest of the digestive system) bypasses the liver, allowing chemicals to go directly into the main bloodstream without having to suffer what pharmacologists call the first-pass effect, i.e., the tendency of drugs to be decomposed by the liver into inactive byproducts before they can reach the target organ (that is mainly why some drugs are given rectally as opposed to orally).\n \n 7. It is known that prostaglandins are decomposed by the lungs (and to a lesser degree, by the liver). This would explain the tendency of sex to suggest heavy breathing in the popular imagination. It would also explain why deep breathing has religious significance to the Hindus. Moreover, it is well known that a popular practice in sexual deviant circles is to try to increase sexual desire by restricting breathing during sex. In fact, there was an infamous mass murderer in the Midwest (don't remember his name) who killed not because he wanted to kill his victims per se but because he so much liked to hold his male sodomy partners underwater while he was sodomizing them that large numbers of his partners drowned to death. And it is well known that murderous child molesters and your other sexual-deviant-type killers disproportionately kill by strangulation (I heard this from an FBI or ex-FBI agent on one of those crime shows, probably Investigative Reports on A&E).\n \n 8. Scientists have never really investigated whether sodomy be addictive (periodically I go to search engines and search these studies, and I never find anything) in the chemical sense that ordinary people tend to use when they use the word addictive in a useful sense (i.e., not as a synonym for pleasant). On the other hand, many scientists have tried to show that desiring sodomy (or male homosexuality, at any rate) is genetic, and they have failed. For instance, the much heralded gene study turned out to be not reproducible by other scientists Doubt Cast on Gay Gene . And the reports of brain structure being different in gays shows nothing inasmuch as it is known that alcoholics also have brain structure different from that of non-alcoholics. Of course, not that the tendency to sodomize or to not have strong defenses against being addicted to sodomy is not largely genetic even if the tendency to want to be sodomized is addictive. People can have a genetic predisposition to become alcoholics, yet clearly alcoholism is not genetic. No one who never ingested alcohol ever became an alcoholic.\n \n Female/female intimacy I think is actually tied up mainly with bisexual feelings. Sperm that goes back-and-forth between females selects for sperm able to survive such travel, and only sperm that has had studly ancestral sperm well-loved by females is likely to have evolved the ability to survive such back-and-forth sex. Thus, female bisexuality tends to select for children with characteristics especially well-loved by females, which are thus likely to be extra desirable. It is a totally different phenomenon from male homosexuality. I'll post about it if people are interested and I don't get banned first for having spoken hatefully of male homosexuals. (From experience I know that this post or similar posts would be deleted or occasion my being banned in most of the forums purporting to offer intelligent discussion of homosexuality.)",

It would be better for moral people if immoral people (as well as moral people) are not screwed-up. Morality is not some black-and-white phenomenon that you've either got or you don't. It comes in degrees. Bad people sometimes have something to offer good people in sexual relationships, at the very least they sometimes have something to offer less bad people.

It's absurd, for several reasons, not the least of which being that many het couples regularly engage in anal intercourse, as well as oral intercourse involving a penis, which he seems to find equally \"immoral\". \n \n He also argues the illogical point that if anal intercourse is \"addictive\" (read enjoyable, because he does not follow standard definitions of addiction), then it makes sense that coersion must be involved. Think about this for a minute- he's arguing that if semen through the digestive tract is \"addictive\", this makes it more likely that people would have to use force to get others to receive semen through the digestive system. Wouldn't the exact opposite be the case?\n \n Of course, he's basing his entire definition of the relative morality of a sexual act on whether or not it is biologically \"addictive\", and where this logic comes from I can't think of, except perhaps that he's got some phychological issues related to enjoying being sodomized more than he feels he should.\n \n It also begs the question of why is it then that women allow men to get them pregnant at all, why do they not instead predatorially fellate as many men as they can? Speaking as a person that has received my share of semen in various ways, the idea that everyone else is into the stuff like it's crack is beyond laughable.\n \n All in all it sounds to me like step314 is either as deluded and nutty as rapture, or they are the same person.",

I am talking about consenting adults engaging in harmless sexual activity that a MAJORITY of adults engage in.

Thus, in 1994, a major study of sexual behavior in the United States found that the 76.6 percent of adult males had performed oral sex, while 78.7 percent had received oral sex.[55] The corresponding figures for adult females were 67.7 percent and 73.1 percent.[56] And, although less information is available on the incidence of anal intercourse between men and women, research indicates that significant numbers of heterosexuals engage in that activity as well.[57] \n \n \n http://www.sodomylaws.org/research.htm \n \n If one is unsure of whether or not their partner is abusive, perhaps you should not be engaging in sexual relations in the first place. And how do you force semen down someones throat? Could they not just spit it out? You make it sound as if harm comes to people who swallow semen? What is the worst thing in your mind that will happen to them? Actually, many sources on this subject state that semen has many beneficial qualities.

   "Three more reasons to believe sodomy a vile addiction:\n \n \n 9. On the face of it, it seems strange that in mammals the y-chromosome would have split off to itself, making crossover in most of the chromosome impossible, thereby bringing a grinding halt to the continued evolution of the genetic material on it, and in fact tending to cause its decay. A simple explanation is that there is a genetic advantage to a species in not ennabling fast evolution of sexual traits exclusive to males, because there is some evil sexual trait exclusive to males which it is very advantageous for a species to stop the continued evolution of. Sodomy being evil explains why it was advantageous for the y-chromosome (which largely regulates testis development) to have stopped evolving-presumably much of the addictiveness of semen stopped evolving at the same time, at least until genes on the other chromosomes took over.\n \n 10. It is surprising that females don't have conscious control over whether a copulation will lead to fertilization. Couldn't such control be easily had? And wouldn't it be a very useful defense against rape? The simple explanation is that pregnancy always being a possibility guards against females experimenting with sex, which would excessively put them at risk of being sodomized. Dogs, I understand, have done one better. If a female dog has sex but does not become pregnant, the dog likely will undergo painful pseudopregnancy. This suggests a female dog has control over whether she can become pregnant (a useful anti-rape defense), but that she still will be discouraged from (imprudently) trying superfluous sex.\n \n 11. Male gonads are exposed in most mammals. Presumably, algesic chemicals produced in the gonads have pain-sensitizing effects. Thus, male gonads being vulnerable tends to make sodomizers cowardly, as is useful to the species. It is relevant that (according to the McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia) the placental terrestrial mammals who lack seminal vesicles (so all the addictive prostaglandins presumably have to be produced by the testes) are those which are in the family carnivora. Obviously cowardice is more harmful when you're a carnivore. The reason the panda is so cute is probably that it is apparently the only non-carnivorous terrestrial placental mammal who (because it is in the family carnivora) lacks seminal vesicles.",

Since anal sex does not carry the risk of pregnancy, being fertile all the time would not discourage it. In fact, just the opposite might be true. I have no sources, but wouldn't a sexual act that cannot end in pregnancy be preferable if one is fertile all the time?",

I have no sources, but wouldn't a sexual act that cannot end in pregnancy be preferable if one is fertile all the time?\n\n \n \n I guess what you are saying is that women having no conscious control over fertilization might encourage them to try sodomy as a form of birth control? No, because to a clean woman, in a half-way reasonable society, sodomy is extremely likely to be repulsive. It may well even be that the more a pure woman is pleased by a man, the more she would fear any particular chance of being sodomized by him. Indeed, if a woman is sodomized by someone she dislikes, she probably will have enough will power to just forget him; however, if she is sodomized by someone she likes somewhat, then it might well be difficult for her to sort out her true feelings from her fake addiction-induced ones. Perhaps in a totally screwed-up society your assertion might hold, but then such societies historically have tended to be doomed to a quick death anyway-just a matter of time before some disciplined tribe of barbarians forcibly destroys the society or its decadent delusions (unfortunately, the whole world now seems to have these delusions to a high perhaps unprecedented degree). \n \n Of course, it is very unfortunate if a pure female allows herself to be sodomized because she is so full of moral idiocy as to think sodomy is like sex, as happens with those pure females who would try sodomy as birth control. But such females will have a much stronger tendency toward moral idiocy than those females who experiment with real sex a little too much. If anything, in comparison with men, empiricism sits pretty well on females in most matters (probably because a fair number of wives excessively stay home all day from fear of giving their mate occasion to feel jealousy, and such women are very lame). Thus, it seems to me, females who get sodomized on account of being a little too imprudent about experimenting with sex are much less likely to be naturally moral-XXXXXX than females who opt to try sodomy as birth control, and so clean females are more deserving of being protected from being too imprudently curious in trying sex than of being protected from being disgusting from stupidity, and so humanity has prospered by the fertile-age female's continual fertility.\n \n There is another consideration, too. Young females I think naturally are more physically pleased by morality in males than are older females. Thus, a female would be more likely to want to postpone procreation and opt for birth control if the male is bad. Hence, better females would not have much of a tendency to want to postpone procreation anyway, and so would not have much need of birth control or tendency to try it. My ideas concerning how age relateds to sex are very complicated, though, and involve sex of course, and this forum purposefully doesn't have a sex subforum, so you'll have to go to my webpage for my theories along these lines.\n \n You can look at it empircally, also. The introduction of the pill seems to have been associated with a new laxity of sexual morals as regards cleanliness.\n \n If for some strange reason a female does feel like experimenting with male sexual ejaculation in a kind of masturbation that could not cause pregnancy, she could always let her partner mastubate in her navel. To me, that would seem more \"sex like\" than rectal sodomy or oral sodomy, anyway.\n \n Your objection is an interesting and plausible one. Still, yours gives no explanation for why human females can't consciously control whether an act of sex is likely to cause fertilization. Probably, a good many mammals have such control. For instance, in some mammals (e.g., the cat, rabbit, and ferret), copulation is necessary for ovulation, which definitely suggests that females of these mammals might have conscious control. It wouldn't seem to be hard for such control to arise, and so given the evil of rape, Why wouldn't it arise unless forcible sodomy be more evil than rape? Why haven't rabbits evolved to be more wise than us? An explantion that explains something is better than an explanation that doesn't, all things else equal.",

I got that. Then you pointed out that some mammals have conscious control (control over their fertility? No, just control over which male they mate to, like humans. They ovulate after they copulate, but they don't control *if* they ovulate after they copulate. It's induced by the mechanical stimulation of the vagina), and from there I lost you.

   "But if it was more addictive then it would be the common form and having more sex is generally evolutionary more favourable. From an evolutionary viewpoint rape isn't bad, it is infact an advantage if it is linked to a gene in someway (don't think it is though, too complex a behaviour for an obvious link, there was something about it in Orangutangs though I can't remember if they thought there might be a genetic link or not) \n \n As for the concious control of fertilisation, I would like to see some evidence for this, I doubt what you are saying here is true at all, as far asI know only Kangaroos have anything even remotely like this and it is neither this or concious (under large amounts of stress preganancy can be paused and put in stasis if in an early enough period)\n \n \"Young females I think naturally are more physically pleased by morality in males than are older females.\" hehe, you really should meet some of my friends",

   " Why wouldn't conscous control arise? But I thought you said it didn't ???\n\n \n I am saying that in many animals the female probably has conscious control over whether fertilization occurs. In a species in which females can't consciously control whether a copulation is likely to lead to pregnancy, rape is an evil thing. Such rape effectively destroys the signficance of sexual selection. Were it not for the tendency of sex for experimentation to put a female at risk for being sodomized, a species would be expected to do much better if in fact unwanted rape could not cause pregnancy. Conscious control over whether pregnancy occurs is a way of ennabling that. \n \n Probably the reason so many species have females in heat for only a short period of time is that this is an advantage if the female has so-called cryptic choice, i.e., an ability to select or encourage the sperm of a particular mate that copulates with her. Indeed, if a male can dominate a female to reduce her choice in mates, and if she is fertile throughout the year, then if she has a copulation with a male besides him, then he can adopt the strategy that he will punish her (by homicide for instance), if she has the nerve to get pregnant soon after her copulation with this other male. On the other hand, if she is just going to be fertile once a year, then he would be more likely to accept her pregnancy and offspring. Even weak females wouldn't be likely to stand for having to wait a whole year after having been \"raped\" to become pregnant, the way they might be likely to agree to waiting a month or a few weeks, say. Because continual fertility is the exception, I am inclined to think that an appreciable degree of cryptic choice is the rule rather than the exception. Kind of hard to prove, though, since it's hard to figure out which male a female prefers.\n \n \nIt's induced by the mechanical stimulation of the vagina\n\n \n Do you have evidence for this? i.e., that mechanical stimulation always induces ovulation? In the rabbitt, according to my bookshelf's mammal textbook, the follicle doesn't even develop until after copulation.\n \n \nFrom an evolutionary viewpoint rape isn't bad, it is infact an advantage if it is linked to a gene in someway (don't think it is though, too complex a behaviour for an obvious link, there was something about it in Orangutangs though I can't remember if they thought there might be a genetic link or not) \n \n \n Hmm, that doesn't sound right at all. Perhaps you could explain more? I would say that in a species like humans that lacks cryptic female choice, rape is very bad. Of course, if in a species a female can consciously decide whether a fertilization is successful, and if the female is fertile infrequently, a female being controlled by a male she doesn't like might appreciate being \"raped\" by another male, this merely increasing her freedom to choose the paternity she wants for her offspring. But perhaps one could argue this should not be called \"rape\" because she really wants it (even if she wouldn't let the male controlling her realize this).",

   "Mentioned evolutionary speaking, if a gene or combination of genes leads to the organism more likely to 'rape' another, then those genes are more likely to get passed on than those which don't, hence in the next generation there will be an increased number of 'rapists'- hence this behaviour if genetic increases the fitness of the organism. It is not in the interest of a female to chose not to let them fertilise the egg as the result would be an increased number of offspring who will be more likely to breed (even if she mates with the best, only one male will be top so only one offspring will breed and it isn;t certain it will be one of hers if the top orang mates with several females, however several 'rapist' offspring will breed and therefore her genes are more likely to be passed on this way and it is regardless of heirachy)\n ('rape' is in inverted commas as it isn't really the best word to use, meaning more mate outside the 'officical' social hierachy)\n \n I still doubt the female choice bit, not sure if this is really accurate. Sure the females choose mates but I think this is purely limited to whether the female physically lets mating occur (by fighting the male if nessesary) rather than a physiological process of undevolping a fertilised egg.",
