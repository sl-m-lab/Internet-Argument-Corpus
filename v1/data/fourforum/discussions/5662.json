   "In another thread Lord T brought up an interesting subject, interest rate inversion. Yesterday I walked into a Wal-Mart with the usual S&L placed just\n inside the front entrance and a chalkboard stated '3.8% six-month CD'. With the latest 10-year treasury issue auction 3.99% yield and 2-year at 3.15%, very close to flat, that caught my eye. I came home and looked at futures, 3.7% on 2-year by 2/06, so given a required buffer, 3.8-9 would seem reasonable. I'd think Gamehuis is looking at that to judge equity market earnings as corporate bonds and commercial paper yields will also show increases. \n \n Has Greenspan stepped on his you know what? His pattern has been .25% increases in the fed rate every three months, now at 3.01, ostentatiously to control inflation, excluding food and energy. Long term treasury offerings have been under-subscribed by the usual players, especially Japan, since the 10/04 election. Europe isn't offering much better due their economic slowdown, which means major players such as China and Japan are mixing their portfolios, hence the reduced demand for long-term US issues. \n \n Flat and inverted rates have historically signaled an imminent economic recession. Combined with polls indicating substantial public dissatisfaction with US leadership, ultimately reflected in declining consumer confidence in an internal transaction driven economy, I'm concerned that the administration will eventually expand their war to again drive GDP in an attempt to stimulate public and individual spending. Any thoughts?",

By the time your average american figures out what the hell happened, it will be over. \n \n If that means expanding the current war to Iran, they will do it. The american public has proven to be exceptionally gullible about such things. All they (the bushies) need to so is continue their \"iranian nuclear weapons are a threat to the entire planet\" rhetoric and they can certainly pull it off, with public approval.

   "The consumer spending part is the part I would expect, and as I believe consumer spending is about 60-65% of the US economy, that should help a little. \n\n \n I persoanlyl find it doubtful that consumer spending will be significantly effected until interest rates hit above 8%. Already average interest rate for credit cards in the US is 16%. These do not generally fluctuate in response to the base rate, and until individuals see their credit card rates going up significantly they will continue charging their way to a better tomorrow.\n \n Production costs are essentially fixed if you are fighting inflation at the consumer end instead of the production end. As long as production costs increase, there is little that can be done as far as inflationary control. Very few manufacturers have excess profit margins big enough to cut prices substantially enough to drop prices in relation to a lower consumer demand due to inflation. The end effect of all this is likely to be reduced production, leading to unemployment. \n \n \nIf and when China and the other Asian economies decide to stop propping up the dollar no amount of interest rate hikes will stop the dollar decline.

   "http://atimes.com/atimes/Global_Economy/GF16Dj01.html\n \n \nThis was precisely what Greenspan did in the 1990s in the name of preemptive measures against inflation. Dollar hegemony enabled the US to print money to fight inflation, causing a debt bubble of asset appreciation. These data substantiated the view of the US as Rome in a New Roman Empire with an unending stream of imports as the free tribute from conquered lands. This was what Greenspan meant by US \"financial hegemony\". \n \n The Fed Funds Rate (FFR)target has been lifted eight times in steps of 25 basis points from 1% in mid-2004 to 3% on May 3, 2005. If the same pattern of \"measured pace\" continues, the FFR target would be at 4.25% by the end of 2005. Despite Fed rhetoric, the lifting of dollar interest rates has more to do with preventing foreign central banks from selling dollar-denominated assets, such as US Treasuries, than with fighting inflation. In a debt-driven economy, high interest rates are themselves inflationary. Raising interest rates to fight inflation could become the monetary dog chasing its own interest-rate tail, with rising rates adding to rising inflation, which then requires more interest-rate hikes. Still, interest-rate policy is a double edged sword: it keeps funds from leaving the debt bubble, but it can also puncture the debt bubble by making the servicing of debt prohibitively expensive.\n This is part of the balancing act that Greenspan has to maintain\n \n\n To prevent this last adverse effect, the Fed adds to the money supply, creating an unnatural condition of abundant liquidity with rising short-term interest rates, resulting in a narrowing of interest spread between short-term and long-term debts, a leading indication for inevitable recession down the road. The problem of adding to the money supply is what John Maynard Keynes called the liquidity trap, that is, an absolute preference for liquidity even at near-zero interest-rate levels. Keynes argued that either a liquidity trap or interest-insensitive investment draft could render monetary expansion ineffective in a recession. It is what is popularly called pushing on a credit string, where ample money cannot find creditworthy willing borrowers. Much of the new low-cost money tends to go to refinancing existing debt taken out at previously higher interest rates. Rising short-term interest rates, particularly at a measured pace, would not remove the liquidity trap while long-term rates stay flat because of excess liquidity. \n \n The debt bubble in the US is clearly having problems, as evident in the bond market. With just 14 deals worth $2.9 billion, May 2005 was the slowest month for high-yield bond issuance since October 2002. The late-April downgrades of the debt of General Motors and Ford Motor to junk status roiled the bond markets. The number of high-yield, or junk-bond, deals fell 55% in the March-to-May 2005 period compared with the same three months in 2004. They were also down 45% from the December-through-February period. In dollar value, junk-bond deals totaled $17.6 billion in the March-to-May 2005 period, compared with $39.5 billion during the same three months in 2004 and $36 billion from December 2004 through February 2005. There were 407 deals of investment-grade bond underwriting during the March-to-May 2005 period, compared with 522 in the same period 2004 - a decline of 22%. In dollar volume, some $153.9 billion of high-grade bonds were underwritten from March to May 2005, compared with $165.5 billion in the same period in 2004 - a 7% decline. \n",

   "As of yesterday, inversion is a fact. Government and tame economists including the US Federal Reserve are crediting it to 'a buildup of world savings finding their way into the US Treasury Bond market'. \n \n Other than nations facilitating US debt to protect their export markets, who's buying US debt with a forecast indicating US national debt will soon equal annual GDP?",

Overall it back up my feeling that the US ( by default Canada) will be in a recession ( official ) by the end of 2006. The initial effects of course will be felt before hand.",

Overall it back up my feeling that the US ( by default Canada) will be in a recession ( official ) by the end of 2006. The initial effects of course will be felt before hand.\n\n \n Our (US) strongest industry is mass residential housing, which is already displaying initial signs of unraveling from higher interest rates. That'll take several months for the spending reductions to filter down through through associated entities, producing credit card delinquencies and eventually mortgage defaults. I look at early-middle summer for full impact on retailers, including the US vehicle industry. As 32% of US lumber, a even larger amount of synthetic building products and a large portion of our energy requirements are now imported from Canada, our situation will impact Canada on the export side. You payment balance will absorb a great deal of that, but it will cost jobs until those products can be redirected to other consumers.\n \n The big issue in my mind is potential US recovery from a recession. We no longer have an industrial base capable of attracting capital to generate new wealth and administration has based all domestic and foreign policy on a very expensive, condemned war of aggression during times of declining tax base and abnormal deficit spending. Any thoughts on recovery?",

Any thoughts on recovery?\n\n \n Recovery will be long and hard. The fed has in my opinion exhausted its room to move, which will provide very little ability to provide economic stimulus. The governemnt is already in deficit spending mode, while likely entering a recession. At about 4% of GDP currently ( second highest in OECD(sp) after Japan) the US gov cant go much higher for very long.\n \n Before the end of the recession I will expect a major revaluation on China's currency ( thier choice ) that will better reflect GDP PPP of China's economy. Of course not before China uses it's massive USD foreign currency reserves to fix some it's own bad debt problems. Overall a large devaluation of the USD has to occur for any long term recovery to take place.",

I dislike using GDP ratios unless deficit and supplementry spending is subtracted. We've painted ourselves into a very tight corner in a short period of time.",
