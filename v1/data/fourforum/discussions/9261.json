   "ISM amnufacturing index was released a few minutes ago. The expectation was a gain in manufacturing activity, a fall in the price index, a gain in employment, and a SIGNIFICANT increase in new orders (due to Xmas season).\n \n From my news ticker:\n \n \nNovember's ISM manufacturing index has eased to 49.5 from 51.2 in October which shows a weakening tendency in the manufacturing sector which will very likely go on in December due to the decline on new orders.\n \n The prices index went up to 53.5 from 47.0 in Oct, employment decreased to 49.2 from 50.8 and new orders decreased to 48.7 from 52.1 in October\n\n \n This is borderline disasterous. In addition, October manufacturing spending came in today with a 1% fall, the largest fall in 5 years (.4% decline expected). Composition on that is especially problematic. Both residential and non residential construction spending fell significantly, with government construction spending showing a major increase. Without the government construciton spending, the decline would have been 1.4%. \n \n The dollar is going to take a SERIOUS beating on this data. \n \n ISM activity index being under 50 is a serious event. Serious enough that the fed has NEVER raised interest rates while it was under 50. Even when Volker was running things, we did not see interest rate increases when the ISM activity index was under 50.",

Prices paid, however, climbed to 53.5 in November, from 47 in October, pointing to continued inflationary pressures even as growth slows. \n \n The ISM said that manufacturing activity appeared to have peaked and November's overall index was likely to be the first of several months under 50.\n\n \n I bet Bernanke is crapping his pants tonight and the spin doctors are working really hard to figure out what line of BS they are going to sell the gullible in coming months. \n \n Coupled with the recent decline of the dollar, we are staring some pretty ugly stagflation in the face.",

Euro, yuan, pound, yen, etc. I'm sure the peso too. The strengthening dollar will not help as much in the exports to solve the national debt as much as the growth we should experience due to its strengthening.\n \n EDIT: The market is slowing, not declining. The S&P 500 is up almost 15% this year and after today should be even closer if not passed. A strengthening dollar could be indications of a pickup in economic activity and more growth but there are several market factors that could negate this effect as well. Overall, I'm optimistic.",

   "Aerospace and defense are based on US government deficit spending and debt.\n \n \n That is not entirely true. Boeing is the US's largest exporter. The defense part, yes, a large part of that is due to government spending, but the moneymaker for Boeing is the aerospace, where most of the money comes from private organizations or foreign governments, not the US government.\n \n \nWhat US industries are expanding with production of value added goods that will bring new wealth into the US and provide true economic growth?

But with the DJIA and S&P 500 up as much as they are this year (between 13 and 15 percent), there is no way all that gain is because of 401k contributions and inflation. Normal 401k contributions are usually around 3-6% per employee (and sometimes companies match up to 3%). This money is then invested in equities or bonds (mutual funds can own both stocks and bonds and whatever else they feel is valuable). This number is also not a 100% participation. Not everyone who invests does it through a 401k (obviously). So 401k contributions do carry weight but not enough to discredit the numbers. Inflation is a bigger beast but it is not out of control either. The FED has kept inflation manageable. But inflation is nowhere near 13-15 percent. I have to believe that the Dow Jones Industrial Average shows pretty close the real average of how the industries are doing. With the amount of volume that passes through it every day, there is no way of discounting or manipulating that.\n \n EDIT: 401k is not a negative to the system. It is new capital contributions to the system that provides capital to companies for expansion. That is the system working. You cannot count IRA, 401k, and pension plan contributions as stagnant money. \n Inflation has been 2-3% annually.",

You cannot count IRA, 401k, and pension plan contributions as stagnant money. \n Inflation has been 2-3% annually.\n\n \n Public companies receive no direct benefit from retirement fund contributions other than driving their stock. 401k contributions are used to purchase their stock. While some company benefit may be derived by increased stock value expanding credit facilities due to a balance sheet equity increase (and increasing senior management bonuses), there are no direct infusions of capital from 401k programs to anyone other than the investment firms and that's in the form of fee revenue. That's what tanked .com 401k contributors and then Enron 401k holders as the bulk had to be put into company stock. Most successful public US companies have been awash in cash due to lack of expansion. There hasn't been any US demand for expansion capital for years. We have capital flight. \n \n As anyone other than MM who contributes to this topic can tell you, 2-3% inflation is far from being a realistic inflation number. There's no energy, food or monetary inflation in that number. In a circumstance I'm currently involved in, we're looking at 8% as a minimum inflation factor and we won't use US equity stocks as a hedge due to their sensitivity to current inflation and future baby boomer demands. Once baby boomers stop contributions and begin serious draw downs on their 401k accounts, equity markets are going to get interesting. \n \n I like S&P reports for large cap reports, but medium and small public companies (and some large ones) have gone from fiddling with revenue to fiddling with cash flow to enhance their paper appearances. I do not consider any equity market stock price as anything other than people buying or selling that particular issue, nor do I consider market trends to have anything to do with anything but earnings reports. Anyone can fiddle with earnings or cash flow and look great for a certain period of time, especially at calender year-end when senior bonuses are often calculated with company equity positions as a bonus component.",
