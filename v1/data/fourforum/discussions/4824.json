They also printed a \"fallen hero\" section in the weekly newspaper with (largely fictional) accounts of the exploits of recently deceased italian soldiers. \n \n Supremacy of the military, not only budgetary, but also excessive glamorization of soldiers and military service, is one of the defining traits of a fascist society.",
