   "I sat thru the entire sham. Absolutely discusting. The movie advocates jurys awarding money to victims because they \"could use it\", not because the they were directly victimized. \n \n A gun company is no more responsible for the use of their product than Louisville slugger. If a bar fight breaks out and someone is killed with the remainance of a beer bottle would we hold Budweiser responsible?",

Terrible movie, total waste of time. \n \n Good book, though.\n \n the book was about tobacco companies, which DID do some pretty nasty, underhanded things during their run through the legal wringer, and they were eventually exposed for it.\n \n As far as I know, the gun industry played above the board. They had nothing to worry about and they knew it, as did the attorneys on the opposite side of the table.",

I hate it when writers and directors give up artistry in their writing for the chance to get on a political soapbox, and then market the movie as if it was just good entertainment. It made this one even worse because it was just inaccurate. Gun manufacturers have done nothing wrong, and they also provide firearms for law enforcement agencies all over the country, as well as the military. They have a positive impact on our society as well as provide for shooting as a hobby.\n \n For what its worth, I think Clinton and the forces against tobacco companies went too far as well in the 90s. It's not that the tobacco companies were not wrong in the way they advertized, it's just that there are a lot of worse things in our society that Clinton could have taken up as a crusade--it's always been odd to me that he chose tobacco as his mission.",

You have a witch hunt, you WILL find a witch.\n \n Of course if the tobacco companies had played above board, it wouldn't have been so bad for them. Instead they tried to coverup and bribe witnesses. Once you get into behavior like that and it is discovered, it becomes pretty tough to convince people you are innocent.",
