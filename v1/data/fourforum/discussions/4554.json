Such armies were seen as dangerous to liberty. The authors of the constitution envisioned a national defense similar to that of switzerland. Following WWII is really hte first time we ever had a substantial standing army, primarily due to our troops being deployed to help supervise the rebuilding of the axis powers. It soon became apparent that a large, well provisioned army was an excellent way to push your corporate interests, so instead of going back to a pre WW level of defense, we kept our large military as an offensive force and used it to push our corporate interests all over the world.\n \n The second amendment was primarily for the defense of the people of the united states, against their own government if need be. I beleive it was Thomas Jefferson who noted that the beauty of the second amendment was that it would not be needed until they tried to take it away. \n \n As for why the \"defend against the government\" argument is not used in court.....That would be rather foolish, wouldn't it? To get up in front of a civil servant (the judge) who has the power to toss you in jail, and argue that you need your firearm so you can shoot civil servants. \n \n I don't see that as a winning case.",

By this time the town of Boston had become a hotbed of dissent against English rule, and England had responded by increasing the number of soldiers posted to the town. This larger troop presence was intended to awe the populace into submission. The town instead reacted to this increased troop presence by calling upon the inhabitants of Boston to arm themselves for their self defense.

   "The 1689 English Bill of Rights states, \"That the subjects which are Protestants may have arms for their defence suitable to their conditions and as allowed by law;\"\n It doesn't seem very broad to me. This right is still part of the English Bill of Rights and it didn't stop England from confiscating handguns in 1997. Is that the right we've inherited?\n\n \n In my opinion, yes, this was the core of the individual right we inherited. The real point of my post was to show that an individual RKBA already existed, and we inherited it as an individual right. I do not believe that this is the right we have today however, as I'll now attempt to explain. But before I begin, I agree it's worth a look at the relevant portions of the 1689 Bill of Rights. \n \n The complaints in the English Bill of Rights that are relevant to the RKBA were these:\n \n \"By raising and keeping a standing army within this kingdom in time of peace, without consent of parliament, and quartering soldiers contrary to law.\n By causing several good subjects, being protestants, to be disarmed, at the same time when papists were both armed and employed contrary to law.\"\n \n The Bill of Rights resolved the following that was relevant to the RKBA:\n \n \"That the raising or keeping of standing armies in the kingdom in time of peace, unless it be with the consent of parliament, is against law.\n That the subjects which are protestants may have arms for their defense suitable to their conditions, and as allowed by law\"\n \n Again, we see the RKBA mentioned alongside the fear of a standing army. (note also how the complaint about quartering troops echoes our own founders complaints of the same practice being forced upon them, which we redressed in our own 3rd. Amendment)\n \n This is what the English Bill of Rights actually says. But we must understand that the interpretation of the right was much broader at the time we inherited it. Blackstone was THE authority of common law at the time of the revolution, and his interpretation was universally accepted: \"the right of having and using arms for self preservation and defense.\" It was this very broad interpretation which legitimized calls by our founders for the citizens to arm themselves against tyranny, so it is easy to see why our founders would prefer Blackstone's view of the right. \n \n Now as I said, I do not believe that this is the right we have today. England's government has a lengthy history of abandoning the broad interpretation Blackstone put on the RKBA in favor of constantly narrowing it. The real question is what did we do with it?\n \n Just because our founders inherited this right did not mean they were prohibited from attempting to improve or strengthen it. Our founders had every opportunity to say \"hey, there is no need to re-invent the wheel here, so lets just cut and paste what the English BoR said about the RKBA.\" Yet our founders chose to reject language like \"suitable to their conditions, and as allowed by law.\" (which really sounds a lot like \"you can have them as long as we don't pass a law requiring you to give them up.\" A position England aparently adopted with the 1997 handgun ban) Instead, Madison chose to state the right in much stronger and unequivocal terms: \"The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\"  Additionally, in my opinion his inclusion of the militia preamble was never intended to limit the RKBA, but was instead yet another reiteration of the natural belief that a \"well-regulated militia, composed of the yeomanry of the country, have ever been considered as the bulwark of a free people. Tyrants have never placed any confidence on a militia composed of freemen.\" This, in my opinion, is why the preamble says \"a FREE state.\"\n \n Therefore, I believe we did inherit an individual RKBA from our English ancestors. I believe that our founders accepted a broad view of the right as justifying their cause and the claimed necessity of taking up arms. I believe that once freedom was won they had the chance to phrase the right in terms similar to the English Bill of Rights, and they rejected it as too narrow a wording of the right they wanted to protect. Has the individual RKBA been effectively abolished in England? Some say yes, some say no. In any event, more restrictive laws are permitted in England because they were content (foolish, in my opinion) to leave the right restricted by language \"suitable to their conditions, and as allowed by law.\" I for one feel fortunate that our founders did not deem it wise to grant our government the authority to choose whether to \"allow\" me to have an individual RKBA.\n \n ------------\n \n \"The right of self-defense is the first law of nature; in most governments it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest possible limits...and [when] the right of the people to keep and bear arms is, under any color or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of destruction.\" Sir George Tucker, Judge of the Virginia Supreme Court and U.S. District Court of Virginia, in I Blackstone COMMENTARIES, Sir George Tucker Ed., 1803, pg. 300. [Tucker was one of many authors to serve as editor of an edition of Blackstone's work. I believe his comment is completely in accord with Blackstone's Commentaries, and I believe it again illustrates not only how the \"individual right\" view of the RKBA survived the crossing of the Atlantic to America, but also the view of its importance as a broad right to defendant against Tyranny].\n \n \"Perhaps, at some future date, this Court will have the opportunity to determine whether Justice Story was correct when he wrote that the right to bear arms \"has justly been considered, as the palladium of the liberties of a republic.\"  3 J. Story, Commentaries \u00ba 1890, p. 746 (1833).\" PRINTZ v. UNITED STATES, 521 U.S. 898, 937-939 (1997) [Justice Thomas, concurring] (a 10th amendment case, not a second amendment case)",

It seems questionable and contradictory to me. Do I have a right to buy a gun and start shooting politicians? If so, is it fair that I can be arrested for exercising my rights?\n\n \n I think that laws, like history, are written by the victors. Victory has historically justified many crimes comitted by those who win the power to absolve themselve of the inhumanity they exhibited in their struggle for power. \n \n The Second Amendment does not negate laws prohibiting homicides. If David Koresh had possessed the courage to survive his encounter at Waco, then he would have been perfectly free to appear before the tribunal of his victorious adversary and defend himself in court on the grounds that his actions were protected by the Second Amendment and/or a right of self defense. I sincerely doubt, however, that you could ever find 12 people who would accept his defense. My vote would certainly go against him.\n \n Where I am from, we still refer to the Civil War as the \"War of Northern Aggression.\" But my state entered that contest with the immoral goal of preserving slavery, and I will not attempt to justify her actions through the citizen's RKBA. She fought a long and glorious struggle which I believe is forever tainted by its immoral purpose.

   "\n Where I am from, we still refer to the Civil War as the \"War of Northern Aggression.\" But my state entered that contest with the immoral goal of preserving slavery, and I will not attempt to justify her actions through the citizen's RKBA. She fought a long and glorious struggle which I believe is forever tainted by its immoral purpose. She was vanquished, and no one who answered her call to arms was ever permitted to use the Second Amendment as a shield from the wrath of the victor.\n\n \n As one born and initially raised in a Southern state, also living as an adult in the South and experiencing extensive personal and business travel in all Southern states from 1966 through 1989 with equal national and international exposure, I can testify that Southern Pride nationally distinguishes itself in an enduring, yet questionable manner based on tradition. A prime example of fighting city hall generally being on a par with tilting windmills. The US is now experiencing those same growing pains as we face assimilation into a developing global society, with internal social confusion and conceit guiding our path. We have yet to be vanquished as a nation, but as our national civil rights are dismissed in the quest for conformity under the guise of safety, I find it doubtful that our sovereign aggression will be considered as anything but failed rebellion in international reasoning for forgiveness.",

   "In my opinion, yes, this was the core of the individual right we inherited. The real point of my post was to show that an individual RKBA already existed, and we inherited it as an individual right. I do not believe that this is the right we have today however, as I'll now attempt to explain. But before I begin, I agree it's worth a look at the relevant portions of the 1689 Bill of Rights. \n \n The complaints in the English Bill of Rights that are relevant to the RKBA were these:\n \n \"By raising and keeping a standing army within this kingdom in time of peace, without consent of parliament, and quartering soldiers contrary to law.\n By causing several good subjects, being protestants, to be disarmed, at the same time when papists were both armed and employed contrary to law.\"\n \n The Bill of Rights resolved the following that was relevant to the RKBA:\n \n \"That the raising or keeping of standing armies in the kingdom in time of peace, unless it be with the consent of parliament, is against law.\n That the subjects which are protestants may have arms for their defense suitable to their conditions, and as allowed by law\"\n \n Again, we see the RKBA mentioned alongside the fear of a standing army. (note also how the complaint about quartering troops echoes our own founders complaints of the same practice being forced upon them, which we redressed in our own 3rd. Amendment)\n \n This is what the English Bill of Rights actually says. But we must understand that the interpretation of the right was much broader at the time we inherited it. Blackstone was THE authority of common law at the time of the revolution, and his interpretation was universally accepted: \"the right of having and using arms for self preservation and defense.\" It was this very broad interpretation which legitimized calls by our founders for the citizens to arm themselves against tyranny, so it is easy to see why our founders would prefer Blackstone's view of the right. \n \n Now as I said, I do not believe that this is the right we have today. England's government has a lengthy history of abandoning the broad interpretation Blackstone put on the RKBA in favor of constantly narrowing it. The real question is what did we do with it?\n \n Just because our founders inherited this right did not mean they were prohibited from attempting to improve or strengthen it. Our founders had every opportunity to say \"hey, there is no need to re-invent the wheel here, so lets just cut and paste what the English BoR said about the RKBA.\" Yet our founders chose to reject language like \"suitable to their conditions, and as allowed by law.\" (which really sounds a lot like \"you can have them as long as we don't pass a law requiring you to give them up.\" A position England aparently adopted with the 1997 handgun ban) Instead, Madison chose to state the right in much stronger and unequivocal terms: \"The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\"  Additionally, in my opinion his inclusion of the militia preamble was never intended to limit the RKBA, but was instead yet another reiteration of the natural belief that a \"well-regulated militia, composed of the yeomanry of the country, have ever been considered as the bulwark of a free people. Tyrants have never placed any confidence on a militia composed of freemen.\" This, in my opinion, is why the preamble says \"a FREE state.\"\n \n Therefore, I believe we did inherit an individual RKBA from our English ancestors. I believe that our founders accepted a broad view of the right as justifying their cause and the claimed necessity of taking up arms. I believe that once freedom was won they had the chance to phrase the right in terms similar to the English Bill of Rights, and they rejected it as too narrow a wording of the right they wanted to protect. Has the individual RKBA been effectively abolished in England? Some say yes, some say no. In any event, more restrictive laws are permitted in England because they were content (foolish, in my opinion) to leave the right restricted by language \"suitable to their conditions, and as allowed by law.\" I for one feel fortunate that our founders did not deem it wise to grant our government the authority to choose whether to \"allow\" me to have an individual RKBA.\n \n\n Consider the thoughts of a law professor on Blackstone and the English Right to Arms. Some quotations from Steven J. Heyman's article \"Natural Rights and the Second Amendment\"\n \n \n\n In exploring this passage, let us begin with Kates's assertion that \"Blackstone placed the right to arms among \"the absolute rights of individuals at common law.'\"[92] I think it is fair to say that no one who reads Blackstone carefully could come to such a conclusion. It is true that Blackstone discusses the right to arms in a chapter entitled \"Of The Absolute Rights of Individuals.\"[93] As Blackstone makes perfectly clear, however, these consist of the following three articles:[94] (1) the right to personal security, which \"consists in a person's legal and uninterrupted enjoyment of his life, his limbs, his body, his [Page 254] health, and his reputation\";[95] (2) the right to personal liberty or freedom of movement;[96] and (3) the right to private property.[97] In other words, Blackstone's \"absolute rights\" correspond to the classic natural rights of life, liberty, and property. The right to arms, on the other hand, is not an \"absolute right\" but is one of the \"auxiliary subordinate rights of the subject\"[98] - a concept to which we shall return shortly.\n \n It is also important to observe that, in Blackstone's usage, \"absolute rights\" means something quite different than what the term would mean to us.[99] For Blackstone, absolute rights are those that pertain to the individual as such; they are rights that persons would enjoy even in a state of nature, before the formation of society.[100] Such rights are contrasted with relative rights, which are those that arise from various social relationships.[101] In designating certain rights as \"absolute,\" however, Blackstone does not mean to suggest that they can never properly be restricted. On the contrary, he makes clear that these rights are subject to regulation to protect others and promote the common good.[102] Consistent with this principle, Blackstone notes that the right to arms is limited to \"such as are allowed by law.\"[103]\n \n\n \n \n\n In short, Blackstone's doctrine is not one of private resistance by individuals but of \"national resistance by the people.\"[139] And this in turn provides the key to understanding his view of the right to arms. As we have seen, Blackstone describes this right as simply \"a public allowance\" of the right to resist oppression.[140] If the right to resistance is one that essentially belongs to the people as a whole, then the same is true of the right to arms. To be sure, Blackstone does not discuss how such arms are to be held: whether by individuals or by the community (for example, in public stores belonging to the militia). But this would appear to be essentially a practical question. As a matter of principle, Blackstone's position is clear: the right to arms recognized by the English Bill of Rights is not intended to allow individuals to possess weapons for their own purposes, but rather to ensure that the people as a whole have the means to resist tyranny. This is a collective right and is subject to collective control. For this reason, there is no conflict between this right and the qualification, recognized by the Bill of Rights as well as by Blackstone, that the right may be regulated by law.[141] Because the right is one that belongs to the people as such, they have the authority to regulate and control that right through their representatives in Parliament.\n \n In conclusion, a close reading of Blackstone's Commentaries reveals that his view is similar to Locke's.[142] Blackstone does not [Page 260] recognize an inalienable right to have arms for private self-defense, and he understands the right to resistance in collective rather than individual terms. If, as Malcolm argues,[143] Blackstone had a profound influence on the American conception of the right to arms, then this provides powerful evidence against rather than for the individual right interpretation of the Second Amendment.\n\n http://www.saf.org/LawReviews/HeymanChicago.htm",

You cannot shell your cities, use cruise missiles,. bomb within urban areas, or use heavy weapons to their greatest advantage, because if you kill innocents, you loose any support base you might have previously enjoyed. In addition, it is demoralising to your troops, and often they refuse to fire upon theri fellow countrymen. In a popular rebellion, your troops are almost certainly going to be HEAVILY outnumbered as well.\n \n Take the united states for example. Our military only has about 500,000 combat troops. The rest are all support trooops (paper pushers). Our population on any given day is around 300,000,000. Roughly 100,000,000 of those own firearms (including the criminals).\n \n We know that in the event of a civil war, one of the biggest problems that your military forces is wide spread dessertion. Figure we loose half of our troops to desertion. That means you have a military force of 250,000 men to work with. Assuming a popular uprising, that is 250,000 against AT LEAST 150 million. 1/3 of that 150 million is likely either too old or too young to fight (revolutionaries always seem to fall in a certain age range). That makes it 250,000 against 100,000,000. \n \n Just by force of numbers, you will almost certainly win. HAving access to firearms and modern military equipment, as American citizens should, just makes it easier.",

Perhaps that is because \"The purpose of the Second Amendment is to restrain the federal government from regulating the possession of arms where such regulation would interfere with the preservation or efficiency of the militia.\" (U.S. v. Hale)\n \n If there is a right to rebel then I think it is a collective rather than an individual right.

   "Consider the thoughts of a law professor on Blackstone and the English Right to Arms. Some quotations from Steven J. Heyman's article \"Natural Rights and the Second Amendment\"\n \n \n \n \n http://www.saf.org/LawReviews/HeymanChicago.htm\n\n \n \n Sorry it took so long to respond, but work issues demanded my full attention last week. I read the entire article this weekend. It's a very interesting article. I think the article does a fair job of discussing natural rights, and I agree that the RKBA is not an unlimited natural right, but an auxiliary right which can be subject to certain limitations. The problem I find with the analysis in the article is this: I think it confuses the individual RKBA with its actual use in support of the natural right of self defense against tyranny. \n \n Let me start with natural rights. I will agree that natural rights are absolute rights which exist in nature. These rights exist in and of themselves and need no government document to ratify their existence. Natural law is a body of law that is higher than any constitution or government, and it was this very \"Law of Nature and Nature's God\" which our founders used to justify rebellion in the Declaration of Independence. These natural rights were expressed in that document as life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n \n There is a difference which I believe Blackstone makes between natural and auxiliary rights (and I think the article agrees with this). The auxiliary right is a subordinate right, typically codified within a constitution, which serves as a buttress to the natural right. (For example, I believe that all of our rights in the Bill of Rights serve to protect our natural rights of life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness.) For example, watch how Blackstone starts talking about natural rights, and then talks about the auxiliary rights contained within the English Bill of Rights which act to \"preserve these [natural rights] from violation\": \n \n \"And we have seen that these rights. . .consist, primarily, in the free enjoyment of personal security, of personal liberty, and of private property. So long as these remain inviolate, the subject is perfectly free; for every species of compulsive tyranny and oppression must act in opposition to one or other of these rights. [now the switch from lofty natural rights to concrete, auxiliary rights which protect the natural rights-Bryan] To preserve these from violation, it is necessary that the constitution of parliaments be supported in it[s] full vigor. . . .And lastly, to vindicate these rights, when actually violated or attacked, the subjects of England are entitled, in the first place, to the regular administration and free course of justice in the courts of law; next to the right of petitioning the king and parliament for redress of grievances; and lastly, to the right of having and using arms for self preservation and defense.\" Sir William Blackstone, 1 Commentaries on the Laws of England, p. 140 (1st. ed. 1765, reprinted 1979).\n \n In my opinion, the RKBA is an individual auxiliary right which buttresses the natural right of self defense. I say this because I think it beyond question that one of our essential natural rights is the individual right of self defense. This right has always been recognized as twofold. First, there is a natural right of private self-defense against armed enemies or groups. Secondly, in the case of government oppression, the right is also expressed as a natural right of resistance against tyranny. As our founders put it in the Declaration of Independence: \"That to secure these [natural] rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed; that whenever any form of government becomes destructive to these ends, it is the right of the people to alter and abolish it....\" (These guys sure seemed to like that darned \"right of the people\" phrase) I believe that this dual nature of the right of self defense is key to understanding the individual nature of the RKBA. I'll return to that in a moment.... \n \n In any event, let me first deal with Blackstone, for there is no dispute that he considered the right of self-defense to be an important natural right. Indeed, I think that if the article's author had used the edition of Blackstone's Commentaries that would have been found in our early law schools and founder's libraries, he would have noticed that the editor of the American edition of the work interpreted Blackstone's view of the right of self defense as follows:\n \n \"The right of self-defense is the first law of nature; in most governments it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest possible limits...and [when] the right of the people to keep and bear arms is, under any color or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of destruction.\" Sir George Tucker, Judge of the Virginia Supreme Court and U.S. District Court of Virginia, in I Blackstone COMMENTARIES, Sir George Tucker Ed., (cited from the 1803 edition, pg. 300)\n \n Now here is a key flaw in the article: in discussing the RKBA and how it impacts the ability of the English subject to exercise his natural right of self defense against tyranny, the article tries to interpret Blackstone to support a collective right, but it also concedes that Blackstone does not discuss whether the arms protected by the English BoR are to be held individually or collectively (in government controlled armed storage depots, for example). This is in itself an admission that Blackstone cannot be read to support the collective right theory, and I think that the article makes a curious and unsupported stretch in interpreting the following language to nevertheless imply a collective right:\n \n \"The fifth and last auxiliary right of the subject, that I shall present mention, is that of having arms for their defense, suitable to their condition and degree and such as are allowed by law. Which is also declared by the same statute W & M st. 2.c.2. [ie. The Bill of Rights] and it is indeed a public allowance under due restrictions, of the natural right of resistance and self-preservation, when the sanctions of society and laws are found insufficient to restrain the violence of oppression. In these several articles consist the rights, or as they are frequently termed, the liberties of Englishmen. . .  .\" Sir William Blackstone, 1 Commentaries on the Laws of England, p. 136 (1st. ed. 1765, reprinted 1979). \n \n The article suggests that the phrase \"public allowance\" implies that the RKBA is collective. I do not believe that this is the case, and I again believe that the article confuses the individual RKBA with the collective use of that right by several individuals who band together in common defense against tyranny. \"Public allowance\" means that the individual subject is \"allowed by the public\" to keep and bear arms for \"resistance and self-preservation.\" When Blackstone says \"self-preservation,\" who can the \"self\" be other than the individual English subject who is allowed this right? It is undisputed that at English Common Law the individual subject was permitted to use arms in private self-defense. I further believe that when Blackstone speaks of the right of resistance and self-preservation in the case of domestic tyranny, he speaks of the ability which the individual RKBA gives the English subject to band together with others to exercise the natural right of \"national resistance\" against tyranny.\n \n But the larger problem I have with the article is this: It suggests that because the author would read Blackstone as recognizing only a collective right then the colonists must have read it that way as well. This assertion is made in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. For example, it ignores how the colonists in Boston laid claim to an individual right by quoting Blackstone as justification for arming themselves (from the very same passage the article says should be read only as a collective interpretation!):\n \n \"Instances of the licentious and outrageous behavior of the military conservators of the peace still multiply upon us, some of which are of such a nature, and have been carried to so great lengths, as must serve fully to evince that a late vote of this town, calling upon the inhabitants to provide themselves with arms for their defense, was a measure as prudent as it was legal. . . .It is a natural right which the people have reserved to themselves, confirmed by the Bill of Rights, to keep arms for their defense; and as Mr. Blackstone observes, it is to be made use of when the sanctions of society and law are found insufficient to restrain the violence of oppression....\n It is certainly beyond human art and sophistry, to prove that the British subjects, to whom the privilege of possessing arms is expressly recognized by the Bill of Rights,. . .are guilty of an illegal act, in calling upon one another to be provided with them, as the law directs.\" O. Dickerson ed., Boston Under Military Rule, p. 61,79 (1936) [quoting from what was at the time the most widely circulated periodical in the colonies, A Journal of the Times].\n \n These are individual and privately held arms our forefathers are using Blackstone to justify possessing. Additionally, it was General Gage's later trickery and confiscation of these very same private arms, through a false registration and secured storage scheme, which stirred up the Continental Congress to make it a specific and very vitriolic complaint against the actions of their government: \n \n \"The inhabitants of Boston being confined within that town by the general their governor, and having, in order to procure their dismission, entered into a treaty with him, it was stipulated that the said inhabitants having deposited their arms with their own magistrates, should have liberty to depart, taking with them their own effects. They accordingly delivered up their arms, but in open violation of honor, in defiance of the obligation of treaties, which even savage nations esteemed sacred, the governor ordered the arms deposited as aforesaid, that they might be preserved for their owners, to be seized by a body of soldiers; detained the greatest part of the inhabitants in the town, and compelled the few who were permitted to retire, to leave their most valuable effects behind.\" From the Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms, taken from Sources Of Our Liberties, American Bar Foundation, Richard L. Perry, editor, revised edition (William S. Hein & Co. 1990). \n \n Finally, even if (as the article would have us assume) the founders would have read Blackstone to encourage collective storage of arms, then I believe it is safe to assert our founders ignored that advice. They chose to instead rely upon militias formed by men who kept and bore their own private arms:\n \n \"The signification attributed to the term Militia appears from the debates in the Convention, the history and legislation of the Colonies and the States, and the writings of approved commentators. These show plainly enough that the militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. \"A body of citizens enrolled for military discipline.\" And further, that ordinarily when called for service these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of a kind in common use at the time.\" U.S. v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174, 179 (1939).\n \n This leads me back to the dual nature of the right of self defense and how the individual RKBA protects both facets of that natural right. I think the article misuses Locke on the right of self defense. To begin with, the article ignores Locke's comment that disarming the public while arming the few who rule them would invariably result in tyranny: \n \n \"Whereas, by supposing they have given up themselves to the absolute power and will of the legislator, they have disarmed themselves, and armed him, to make prey of them when he pleases. . . .For then mankind will be in a far worse condition than in the state of nature, if they shall have armed one, or a few men, with the joint power of a multitude to force them to obey at pleasure the exorbitant and unlimited decrees of their sudden thoughts, or unrestrained, and, til that moment, unknown wills, without having any measures set down which may guide an justify their actions.\" John Locke, Second Treatise of Civil Government, pp. 114-15 (Chicago, 1955)\n \n Additionally, while I agree that Locke was certainly one of the writers our founders would have been exposed to, he is not, as the article incorrectly suggests, the natural starting point our founders would have used to view the right of self defense. Our founders were raised in an educational system akin to the classical European tradition, where they would have been exposed to great thinkers and writers like Aristotle and Cicero in addition to Locke. Indeed, Thomas Jefferson referred to their works as comprising the \"elementary books of public right.\" Jefferson, Living Thoughts, p42. (J. Dewey edition, 1963). See what our founders would have found reading Aristotle:\n \n \"Winning the battle of Pallenis, he seized the government and disarmed the people; and now he held the tyranny firmly, and he took Naxos and appointed Lygdamis ruler. The way in which he disarmed the people was this: he held an armed muster at the Temple of Theseus, and began to hold an Assembly, but he lowered his voice a little, and when they said they could not hear him, he told them to come up to the forecourt of the Acropolis, in order that his voice might carry better; and while he used up time making a speech, the men told off for this purpose gathered up the arms, locked them up in the neighboring buildings of the Temple of Theseus, and came and informed Peisistratus.\" Aristotle, Athenian Constitution. (Emphasis added).\n \n \"For those who can possess and wield arms are in a position to decide whether the constitution is to continue or not.\"  Aristotle, Politics, T. Sinclair Trans. 1962, p. 274.\n \n Additionally, one of the founders the article specifically focuses on was John Adams. If you want to understand how John Adams viewed the right of self defense, you need to look past Locke alone to see Cicero, whom John Adams openly admired as the \"\"greatest orator, statesman, and philosopher of Rome.\" 1 John Adams, WORKS p. 26. (C. Adams edition, 1970). In particular, see Cicero's discussion of the individual RKBA and its use in exercising the natural law right of self defense (which he explained while defending his friend, Titus Annius Milo, who was on trial for a politically motivated murder charge when in reality he acted in self-defense): \n \n \"And indeed, gentlemen, there exists a law, not written down anywhere but written in our hearts; a law which comes to us not by training or custom or reading but by derivation and absorption and adoption from nature itself; a law which has come to us not by theory but from practice, not by instruction but by natural intuition. I refer to the law which lays it down that, if our lives are endangered by plots or violence or armed robbers or enemies, any and every method of protecting ourselves is morally right. When weapons reduce them to silence, the laws no longer expect one to await their pronouncements. For people who decide to wait for these will have to wait for justice, too--and meanwhile they must suffer injustice first. Indeed, even the wisdom of the law itself, by a sort of tacit implication, permits self- defense, because it does not actually forbid men to kill; what it does, instead, is to forbid the bearing of a weapon with the intention to kill. When, therefore, an inquiry passes beyond the mere question of the weapon and starts to consider the motive, a man who has used arms in self-defense is not regarded as having carried them with homicidal aim.\" Cicero, Selected Political Speeches, p. 222 (M. Grant, trans. 1975)\n \n (And if you want to see who really influenced Blackstone, then I suggest that if you look beyond the article's focus on Locke you will see the article unknowingly quotes Blackstone mirroring Cicero's line of thought: \"[112] Individuals do retain a right to defend themselves against imminent violence, for \"[s]elf-defence . . . is justly called the primary law of nature,\" and \"is not, neither can it be, in fact, taken away by the law of society.\"[113] But this right is limited to \"sudden and violent cases; when certain and immediate suffering would be the consequence of waiting for the assistance of the law.\"[114]\" [from the article itself, including its footnote citations] You can easily see how he mirrors Cicero in this passage)\n \n And there is far more than this which the article ignores. For example, one major writer our founders were exposed to was Montesquieu. The doctrine of separation of powers was lifted from his writings, and from 1760 to 1805 no European political theorist was quoted more often than Montesquieu by major political writers in America. Donald Lutz, The Relative Influence of European Writers on Late Eighteenth-Century American Political Thought, 78 Am. Pol. Sci. Rev., at page 194, table 3 (March 1984). What would our founders have read form him concerning self-defense and the RKBA:\n \n \"If a slave, says Plato, defends himself, and kills a freeman, he ought to be treated as a parricide. This is a civil law which punishes self-defense, though dictated by nature. . . .\n It is unreasonable. . .to oblige a man not to attempt the defense of his own life. . . .\n Who does not see that self-defense is a duty superior to every precept. . . .\n [T]he laws of an Italian republic [Venice], where bearing fire-arms is punished as a capital crime and where it is not more fatal to make an ill use of them than to carry them, is not agreeable to the nature of things....\"  Montesquieu, The Spirit of Laws, pp. 59, 60, 64, and 79-80 (trans. T. Nugent, 1899). \n \n Furthermore, when the article cites Massachusetts history, it also chose to ignore influential Massachusetts citizens like Samuel Adams who spoke out in favor of the individual RKBA: \n \n \"And that the said Constitution be never construed to authorize Congress to infringe the just liberty of the Press, or the rights of Conscience; or to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms. . .\" Samuel Adams, Debates & Proceedings in the Convention of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 86-87 (February 6, 1788).\n \n Now we come back to the article's admitted problem of being forced to acknowledge that Blackstone cannot be read to require collective storage of the arms to be used in \"national resistance.\" This is where I see the understanding of the dual nature of the natural right of self defense assert itself. To me, our founders understood, like Blackstone, that the individual RKBA would protect both facets of the right of self defense. Like England, our laws have always permitted the use of individual arms in private self defense. Second, these individual arms were also intended to be used collectively in militias to lessen the call for a professional army. Finally, if a professional army were raised and used as an instrument of oppression, the individual RKBA could be used collectively in national resistance. In the end, although the article focuses selectively on John Adams, I think it ignores the following quote which helps illustrate his understanding of the dual nature of the right of self defense which the individual RKBA helps protect: \n \n \"To suppose arms in the hands of citizens, to be used at individual discretion, except in private self-defense, or by partial orders of towns, counties or districts of a state, is to demolish every constitution, and lay the laws prostrate, so that liberty can be enjoyed by no man; it is a dissolution of the government. The fundamental law of the militia is, that it be created, directed and commanded by the laws, and ever for the support of the laws.\" John Adams, A Defense of the Constitutions of the United States, 1787-1788\n \n Now here is one final question: While this quote clearly illustrates John Adams' view that privately held arms may be used in individual self defense, doesn't it also suggest that to avoid anarchy the right to exercise your individual RKBA in a collective militia should be regulated and controlled by the states? That's a question for another day....",
