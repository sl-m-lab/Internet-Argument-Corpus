   "a lot has been said about abortions here.\n I would like to post a couple questions.\n Philosophically, an entity can either exist, or not exist. There are no grades of existence. This is true to humans. A living human either exists, or it does not. There is no progression in its existence. The pro-abortionists argue that there is a time when fetus is NOT a human, based on physiology. But my question is, who decides when a fetus IS or IS NOT a human. Is this the age? Or the number of cells? Or development of the brain? Who has authority to draw these lines? Politicians? Or doctors? Or mothers? Or professors?\n I argue that there can not be an objective way to judge when 2 multiplying cells actually become a human being other then in the moment when they appear from the egg and sperm. Because I don't see an authority who has a moral right or even ability to tell where this line can be drawn. We have observed during some time how these boundaries kept moving. And as long as there is no unity in this issue, there is also no objectivity in this issue. And obviously there is no unity. Therefore there is no other way to say that the human being begins existing after a certain point other then the moment of male and female cells coming together. And there is no authority to draw any other lines.",

I don't see consistency in your reasoning. Because this IS my question - WHO's in the position to say that doing abortion is better then making a woman carry the baby?

Making someone go through surgery is morally wrong, making someone donate an organ is morally wrong, making someone go through a pregnancy is morally wrong. No one has the moral authority to require this. It is tantamount to slavery. Killing my slaver would not be morally wrong when he enslaves me, for example. I would be morally in the right.\n \n Babies are a gift of God. It is destroying it as a gift if you REQUIRE someone to continue a pregnancy against their will. If it is required, it is an obligation. An obligation destroys the concept of generosity and self-sacrifice. A woman must be willing to continue the pregnancy for the baby to be truly a gift. Otherwise it is merely an obligation, a perversion of the way things should be.\n \n What consistency is there in your reasoning? How do you choose the baby over the mother?

Duty and obligation should not be the only reason one continues a pregnancy. A woman should never be forcibly obligated to share her body or donate the use of her organs, and neither you or anyone has any moral authority to force her to use her body in that way. Whatever moral obligation there would be, whatever duty she feels, it is a personal journey and is for her to decide what obligation or duty she feels (whether or not she's right).\n \n Also, while selfishness is not a virtue it is also not for you to enforce self-lessness. It is not really self-less to be forced to be self-less. It has to come from within and some women cannot face this for reasons of their own. This is why God gave us free will, and this decision has to be between her and God. You and I lead by example, we can't and shouldn't command this.

The baby is no longer drawing blood and everything from the mother and it no longer lives inside her body.

Since the baby is undeniably using her body, she has the moral authority to stop that, just as she would have the moral authority to refuse to donate an organ.\n \n I didn't forget it is a baby and I didn't forget that abortion kills it while it's in the womb. I am saying HER sin or her decision (if it is not a sin) doesn't justify YOUR morally wrong decision.

   "Another opinion", 
   "The term \"morality\" has been used by the religious right so often in specifying a particularly strict religious moral code, that we sometimes forget its more general meaning. Namely, people of different religions and cultures, both in recent years and in pre-history, have come up with codes of behavior based on an inherent sense of what is right and wrong - namely, a sense of morality. There is no absolute moral code that all people follow but there are general trends that one can observe - against murder, against theft, etc. - that seem to be part of human nature itself. Our country (U.S.A.) was founded on the idea that no one religion can force itself and its moral code on the general populace (as the Church of England was doing at the time in the country of origin of most of the founders). Laws were to be determined by rational concensus. This did not mean that people could not be inspired in their leadership by religion, just that they could not base their decisions on religious arguements - a big difference. Similarly, the arguements for or against abortion rights have to be based on rational, not religious, reasoning. If you are inspired by your religion to have certain beliefs about abortion, you have to present rational, not religious arguements to win the case.\n \n In my own analysis of the abortion issue, I approached it by asking myself why I personally believe that murder of post-birth people is wrong and then applied that reasoning to the fetus. For me, the basic idea is that I believe that killing a born person is wrong because I can empathize with their situation - the fear, the suffering, the sense of loss. Even if a person is killed without suffering (in their sleep, or while unconscious), then there is still the sense of loss - they existed, had a life, emotions, aspirations, etc. which are being snuffed out. How does this apply to the fetus? I can empathize with a late term fetus for similar reasons - they exist mentally, have some rudimentary emotions and feelings. If I can empathize with a suffering animal then I can certainly empathize with a late term fetus as well. However, in early pregnancy, an embryo and fetus has no mental existence (none is developed yet) so there is no-one there to empathize with yet. There is only a growing body that will someday have a rudimentary mind (emotions, feelings, etc.) but not yet. So my sense of morality against murder does not apply in that situation. \n \n All in all then, as I have said in other posts, I would allow abortion at the early stages of pregnancy where there is no mental existence yet (only a body) and would strictly limit it in late stages when the fetus already has a mental existence.",

Therefore when sex took place the choice took place.\n \n The problem is that people want a good time with no responsibility. The time to choose is not after you've consented sex with someone and have become pregnant. That is not the time to say... \"I don't want this child.\"\n \n Alot of abortions are taking place outside of marriage which only means sex is happening outside of marriage. This correlation should set off an alarm. Sex outside of marriage is causing an enormous amount of unwanted pregnancies because women do not want to raise a child by themselves and are scared because no one is committed to them (among many other reasons).\n \n Contraceptives are not the answer. If they were... we'd see the number of abortions go down. That just isn't the case folks. The number per year has remained fairly steady or if anything has grown.\n \n I'm not advocating taking away contraceptives. I'm advocating people choosing to have sex within the context of marriage where a couple is committed to each other.\n \n Lastly. I don't remember eggs and sperm choosing each other from my classes in biology. I think it is the first two to meet is how that happens.\n \n So... I the choice takes place when sex takes place or does not take place. \n \n People simply want to shirk their responsiblity and say it is their right to not have a child if they so choose. Which I agree but not after the fact!\n \n -theo\n \n If you legalize the opportunity to sin... people will choose it that much more easily.",

   "I don't believe a woman is forced to have children, the case of rape being the exception. Therefore when sex took place the choice took place.\nMost of the time, whether in marriage or outside of marriage, people don't have sex in order to have children. They have sex in order to enjoy the emotional and physical intimacy and often just for the pleasure of it. Only in the minority of sexual situations are they actually choosing to have children. The accidental pregnancies are a result of nature interfering with their plans. \n \n Though I may not hold your moral views against sex outside of marriage, I do share a concern that far too many sexual situations happen with no sense of responsibility for the consequences of sex - namely, pregnancy. Be it out of shear stupidity, indifference, or bad luck (many contraceptives being ~99% effective - not 100%), so many acts of sex do result in unwanted pregnancies. So, the question is what to do next. \n \n I would also look down upon those couples who simply acted irresponsibly, but does that mean that we should force them to carry the pregnancy to term? That decision is far too important to base on any feelings of disgust at their irresponsible and/or immoral actions. The decision has to be based on the situation at hand and the inherent rights of the mother and fetus. Mostly it is the parents that can best judge the situation at hand and whether or not they can support a baby. Since it is the mother that is pregnant and carries far more sacrifice, it is ultimately up to her, though I would strongly hope she would consult with her partner (unless he is a dead-beat).\n \n As for the inherent rights of the mother and fetus, this is where it gets tricky since our nation has never decided when a fetus is developed enough to have the rights of a full person. That constitutes so much of the pro-life vs pro-choice debate. I find myself between the two since I don't place that point at either extreme but in between the two - at around 30 weeks, when the fetus can first start having a mind, not just a body.",

In much the same way someone walking down the street realises there is a chance they will be mugged. In neither case does the victim (the people having sex, or the people walking down the street) choose to be mugged, or pregnant. In fact, using contraceptives can reduce the chance of pregnancy to one in ten thousand.\n \n 2 - Clearly, the issue to you is choice, and not the babies life.

Thank you.\n \n In response to Wez's comment:\n \nWhat's the difference between sex with a condom and rape? In neither case, the woman chose to have a child. Yes she took a chance with the condom failing, but she also took a chance by allowing herself to get into the position to be raped.\n \n Wez, I read this and re-read this to make sure I read you right. You know, I think I'd retract that statement if I were you. You're basically assuming that every woman who gets raped is at fault for it happening. I'll agree and say that there must be some percentage of rapes to which this might be true but not generally. Also, I really cannot compare using a condom and rape. I think I would have a majority of support on that. Lastly, you make some statements about the number of pro-lifers and pro-choicers. That's nice but it doesn't mean that pro-choicers are right. Also, how about providing some statistics or numbers to support your claim.\n \n In response to Simone:\n \nIt's a ridiculous question, theo, because I wouldn't be here at all if it hadn't happened by BOTH MY FATHER AND MY MOTHER WANTED ME TO BE.\n \n Simone, you are right in saying it is a ridiculous question. The point of asking it is to show how ridiculous it is to not want your children.\n \n In response to Adept's last comments:\n \n Nonsense? It is a fact that you might get pregnant but it isn't nonsense. It is reality. The chance of becoming pregnant was not argued from the standpoint of not having sexual intercourse but rather responsible sexual intercourse in the context of marriage. Contraceptives can work if used, I agree. If used. The 1% chance still does not resolve the issue of having children outside of marriage. Secondly, I didn't state that aborting children from rapes was ok. I just made the point that in any other context a woman consents to have sex. In either case consentual or non-consentual I believe a woman should have the child. For me, it is not the issue of choice as much as it is the life of the child. I hope that much is clear.\n \n In response to Sigma:\n \n To answer your question I am glad that my mother wanted me and chose to have me. Even if she did not want me and I was born I can honestly say that I'm glad to be alive and could not use this arguement to support aborting me if she didn't want me. Lastly, you didn't answer my question again. I didn't ask \"Are you glad your mom wanted you?\" I asked, \"Would you have rather been aborted or born?\" It is as simple as saying, \"I'm glad I was not aborted\". But your answer will suffice since it implies this appreciation of your own life and having not been aborted.\n \n In response to Another Opinion:\n \nThe decision has to be based on the situation at hand and the inherent rights of the mother and fetus.\n\n Apart from the law giving the mother the right to abort her child, how can you say that a woman has such a right? As for determining when a child exists. I think the moment sperm and egg meet, life has begun forming. I can't see any reason to look at it any other way. A woman should not have the right by law to abort her child because she simply cannot afford it or doesn't want it. These and so many other reasons used to support a womans right to choose to kill her child are so minor when compared with the chance for life. Is life with less clothing and money worth less than one with much? Is this really a valid reason for ending life?

Why is that so ridiculous?\n\n \n Simone, your comments are so conflicting and confusing. Please try to communicate your ideas better.\n \n I was saying that the purpose of my question is not supposed to be a question you could ask if you were actually never born... which is why the answer is obviously \"LIFE\". That is the point of the question. Your parents didn't abort you... you are alive... and I am pointing out that you should choose to not abort your children because you were not aborted... and unless you are, for some reason, unhappy about the fact that you are alive... why would you want to abort your own children. What good reason do you have that will justify taking an unborn child's life?\n \n To abort the child just because you are not ready to welcome him into the world is not justifiable. There are plenty of women who cannot have children, couples who want to adopt, and even if the child never has parents... it still is not a justifiable reason to abort.\n \n My wife and I are thinking about having a child soon. We have some good size credit card debt. I make enough to support the both of us but I'm not so sure about how it'll work out if and when we decide to have a child. My wife and I do not use contraceptives. We are going by a method called natural family planning. I'm sure you can find info on the web about it if you feel compelled to look. We are planning but even so... I don't think we'll be ready when we actually have a child. Regardless, I'm sure our lives will change for the better and our budget will change and we'll enter a new stage of life together.\n \n There are choices to make. Aborting is not a justifiable one... and definitely should not be legal. Please understand that my motives are for good.\n \n -theo",

   "Jitobear, are you kidding me? Is there some kind of justifiable war against unborn children? Is an unborn child trying to kill you so that you should take actions of self defense against that unborn child? War, self-defense, and abortion are very very different circumstances. You cannot equate these.\n\n \n That was not why I was saying. I was saying that if killing is sometimes justifiable that it can also sometimes be justifiable in the case of pregnancy. \n \n \nMay I ask why that child deserves to die just because a woman was raped? \n\n \n May I ask you why you think aborting to due to rape has anything to do with the fetus at all? It's not about revenge you know. When you actually figure that out, you will be a little closer to convincing me that you actually view women as people.\n \n \nI don't pretend to know the horrible experience of rape... \n\n \n And I don't have to.\n \n \nI am simply proposing an alternative to killing that child because a woman was raped.\n\n \n Propose away. However, forcing a rape victim to remain pregnant against her will makes you a rapist in my book.\n \n \nWhy not give the child for adoption? \n\n \n Maybe I will lose my job, or my scholorship, or maybe, you know, I just don't want to be pregnant. My body is not up for hi-jacking. I did not consent to the sex or the pregnancy and I am not a brood mare. I won't give up one thin dime or one more second of my life to a rape. I won't. Mark my words.\n \n \nIt does not have to have such a huge impact on your livlihood.\n\n \n Please. Stop now. I have been pregnant.\n \n \nWell, if I didn't care for my own wife it would definitely say alot about my care for other women. So, since I do love my wife I feel it is evidence that I do care for women in general since she is a woman.\n\n \n My son is Mexican. I love him more than anything on the planet. His father is Mexican. I hate him more than anyone on the planet.\n \n Tell me, how do I feel about Mexicans?\n \n \nI didn't argue that my love for women or lack thereof gives me any rights to make decisions that would impact you. I am a citizen of the United States and therefore have the right to vote and use my voice to affect the laws of our country. This gives me the right to make decisions that would impact us all.\n\n \n My pregnancies don't impact you.\n \n \nI was simply showing that your assumptions about my being a woman demonizer were wrong and that I do truly care for women which is why I stand on the side of life with regards to the issue of abortion.\n\n \n No. \n \n If you treat stats as the truth of the lives of women. If you think pregnancy really doesn't impact a woman's finances, let alone life. If you pressure for laws that will completely disregard women. If you can't understand why a rape victim should not be forced to be responsible for the child of a rapist. If you feel you know what is better in every woman's life than she knows herself. You barely notice women exist, let alone love them.\n \n \nI make no apologies for the truth. Those stats are not just numbers Jitobear, those are real people... real children who have been killed. Honestly... the infanticide revealed there makes me very angry and ill.\n\n \n The fact that you can't see past them to the women involved makes me angry and ill.\n \n \nThey are not my laws alone. They will be the result of the people... the democracy we live in... whether the law supports or goes agains abortion. Everyone must act responsibly and I hope that the abortion laws get severely reversed to eliminate the majority of abortions.\n\n \n And then you and your cronies can back each other on the back and sleep well at night. Blind then, as you are now, to the damage you do.",

   "Apart from the law giving the mother the right to abort her child, how can you say that a woman has such a right? As for determining when a child exists. I think the moment sperm and egg meet, life has begun forming. I can't see any reason to look at it any other way. A woman should not have the right by law to abort her child because she simply cannot afford it or doesn't want it. These and so many other reasons used to support a womans right to choose to kill her child are so minor when compared with the chance for life. Is life with less clothing and money worth less than one with much? Is this really a valid reason for ending life? Please go look at the statistics on the reasons for abortions by clicking the link I have provided above.\nThere are two rights at stake not just one. You seem to be disregarding the right of a woman over her own body - a very significant right. Yes, people certainly have the right to life and, so far, this right has been applied only to born people. I would think that even most pro-choice advocates would admit that there isn't much inherent difference between a fetus one day before birth and a baby one day after birth. However, most pro-life proponents would probably have to admit that they do notice a difference between a newly fertilized egg and a newly born baby.\n \n You seem to place the rights of a newly fertilized egg (that has no mind, no sense of pain, emotions, thought, etc.) above the rights of the mother. What motivates this? Is it merely the fact that it has human DNA and will someday become a born baby - i.e. its genes and its potential - or is there something more? If that is it then that is not nearly enough for the majority of people to take away such a fundamental right as the right over one's own body. Speaking for myself, my main moral judgement is based on empathy. I advocate strictly limiting very late term abortions since there is a mental being there that I can empathize with. That is not the case for a newly fertilized egg.",

Maybe I am not led to adopt at this point in my life and possibly never but that doesn't mean I'm not doing anything.

I don't think I'm perfect. I know I'm not. I don't expect abortion to disappear but I do hope to rationalize this subject to people to help them consider the consequences of aborting their child.

It is easier in a sense to say I just don't want this child than it is to care for it. All you are advocating to me is the right to say that statement and do away with a life just because it will inconvienence you.\n\n \n What's wrong with erring on the side of the woman's judgement? She obviously knows what's best for her. It's easier to just let her make her own decisions.\n I must protest with your usage of the word \"inconvenience\". \n \n \n \nBell, you've got that remark under your statements about Bush having the ring. You know what... the number of innocent american lives lost to the war in iraq whether you think the war was just or not... will never compare to the number of innocent american lives lost to abortion. There is no reason for this... in the majority of cases... \"I just don't want this child.\" is the reason! I just wonder who really has this ring on?...\n\n \n This is irrelevant and off topic. I will say that if Bush had soldiers gestating inside his body he could do as he pleases. :)\n \n \nEveryone needs to know this. I don't think I'm perfect. I know I'm not. I don't expect abortion to disappear but I do hope to rationalize this subject to people to help them consider the consequences of aborting their child. I make mistakes but I'd be a fool to not listen to someone's correction/advice and not repeat the same thing again and again. I'd like to spare someone the trauma of abortion and giving up their child because they think they can't support it or that it isn't the right time or whatever... You've got to see that it isn't right. You have to...\n\n \n So if I came to you, and you didn't know me, what would advice would you tell me if i said I was pregnant and wanted an abortion? What if I said I used birth control, and it failed? What if I said I was sick 24/7, couldn't work, couldn't eat, wasn't married, had a mountain of debt, zero support, parents are dead, trying to make it in school, have a family history of mental disorder? I really would like to know, and I'm not being sarcastic or anything. PM me if you like. \n \n Cheers.",

Self defense because someone is trying to take your life....can the fetus kill you in self defense (if they could)?\n\n \n We're not trying to find analogies to abortion, simply examples where society kills. Self-defense in on an individual basis, not societal. Society would kill in examples such as the death penalty and war. Both of these things are justifiable killings (in terms of being legal, not moral), and every society has justifiable killings. Justifiable killing on an individual level depends on the circumstances. Self-defense, defense of another, killing a trespasser, killing a burglar, abortion, or killing someone who is committing a felony are examples of justifiable killing (the extent depends on State law). In fact, Florida recently passed a law allowing citizens to respond with deadly force any time they feel threatened.\n \n In answer to your question, it depends on State law. The law could not in anyway prevent women from acquiring abortion in the first trimester, but if it does not infringe upon that then yes.\n \n \n\n And another person shouldn't have been forced to have to live off of you for survivial but it appears the choice has already been made.

If both will die if they are left connected, the one least likely to survive may be allowed to die to save the other.\n \n However, the body does not 'belong' to one or the other. They were both born with that body, and they both would have the right to its resources. There is no comparison in this way to the fetus, because the woman was born with that body and it belongs to her alone.\n \n \n\n If you kill the fetus it is done without consent and you don't even know what the fetus's will is!

If you force someone into your house can you kill them because they aren't there with your consent?\n\n \n Even if a person comes into your home with your consent, you can forcibly evict them if they refuse to leave. If there were no other way to get them out of your house killing may indeed be justified. This isn't the case, however, as you can forcibly evict them without killing them so killing is not justified.\n \n \n\n If you force someone in a plane, fly to 20,000ft and then decide this person can't be in your plane can you just throw them out?

Reasonable in this case would require you to land before booting him out as you do not suffer any significant detriment allowing him to stay on board for that time.

Everyone approaches this issue of abortion as if there is no other options in life to the issue. What about women long ago when there were no abortions? ..or rather crude ones.

   "Correct me if I am wrong, but isn't the violinist case where you get kidnapped and taken to the violinist's house? (referring to the one by Thomson)\n\n \n The violinist did not kidnap you and had no part in attaching himself to you, which is the thrust of the argument. The violinist himself was forced to be attached to you. The argument never states where you were taken or where the violinist was taken though neither are relevant.\n \n Excerpt from Judith Jarvis Thompson's \"Violinist\" argument:\n \n \nYou wake up in the morning and find yourself back to back in bed with an unconscious violinist. A famous unconscious violinist. He has been found to have a fatal kidney ailment, and the Society of Music Lovers has canvassed all the available medical records and found that you alone have the right blood type to help. They have therefore kidnapped you, and last night the violinist's circulatory system was plugged into yours, so that your kidneys can be used to extract poisons from his blood as well as your own. The director of the hospital now tells you, \"Look, we're sorry the Society of Music Lovers did this to you-we would never have permitted it if we had known. But still, they did it, and the violinist now is plugged into you. To unplug you would be to kill him. But never mind, it's only for nine months. By then he will have recovered from his ailment, and can safely be unplugged from you.\n\n \n You being kidnapped is technically part of the argument, but has no relevance and certainly is not the basis as you claimed. Though I was incorrect in stating the violinist was kidnapped (we don't know, but it isn't relevant anyway), the moral equivalence stays the same whether you were kidnapped or woke up in your own bed. Part of the basis is that both you and the violinist were forced into this position, which gives it the moral similarity to abortion, and you do not want to be attached anymore.",

Having that law is no more dictatorial than any other law protecting others lives.\n\n \n You are playing God by trying to take on God's role of judging moral matters. You wish to decide who lives and who dies, exactly what you accuse pro-choicers of. Pro-choice people would leave it between the woman and God, while you want to take God out of it entirely.\n \n Making a Federal ban on abortion is absolutely dictatorial and is a step toward fascism. Any other law protecting lives does not do it at the direct expense of other's rights. \n \n \n \n Lastly, I'm not saying pregnancy is an inconvienence. You and others are. That's why you'd prefer to abort than keep the child.\n\n \n No, I have never said I'd prefer anyone to abort rather than keep the child. I am saying pregnancy is a big deal and not all woman wish to go through it. Stating that banning abortion just saves lives ignores that pregnancy is a big deal and that forcing a woman to continue something that is a big deal, even to save a life, is never simple and certainly is immoral in this case.\n \n \n \n I will say it again... you (choicers) are acting like there is no other alternative... and that they are all alone in this predicament... and that if they want to abort... they should be allowed. Think outside of yourself for a moment... realize that there are tons of people and organizations doing everything they can to help mothers decide to keep their children.\n\n \n Good! I'm ecstatic that there are organizations that help mothers keep their pregnancies if the women wish to keep their pregnancies. I really truly am. Sometimes, for whatever reason, keeping their pregnancy is not something they wish to do or can do, and they should have an option open to them besides keeping their pregnancy, because pregnancy is a very big deal.",

   "My question is worded very specifically. \"Gestation\" only refers to pregnant females. That is part of the reason I used the exact wording.

I know that your position is that a government should impose a nine month forced gestation period and make the labor and birthing process mandatory. I wanted to see if Theo's position is the same.\n \n The pro-life position is often very clear: The fertilized ovum is a human being and therefore, abortion is murder and the government needs to stop the murder. The pro-choice position is a more complex one. It not only disagrees with the statement that the fertilized ovum is a human being because then they would have to agree that the government has to stop it.

I thought you were using the term &#8220;human&#8221; differently. I understand from this that your position is that a fertilized ovum is a human being. I disagree, but you have every right to believe that.\n \n \nI stated:\n You assume that the fertilized ovum is a human being. That is not accurate. There is a difference between an ovum (egg) and a being.\n \n Just because you say so doesn't make it true. I remember you saying this to Cone a few posts back. \"Being\" is really just existence. And a fertilized egg is a human of existence. I don't just make this stuff up you know. But why should this matter anyway? Just say you support killing some human beings, it doesn't seem like you would change your mind over what kind of creature the fetus or egg is.\nI don&#8217;t believe that an egg is a human being. You are entitled to your belief. The rest of your paragraph does not merit response.\n \n \nYou are going to have to define for us \"indentured servitude\" because as I understand the term, pregnancy would not fall into that category.\nI never said that pregnancy was indentured servitude, that is a misrepresentation of my position. Perhaps you had forgotten that you were responding to my statement about a government forcing a woman to continue a nine month long gestation period and a mandatory labor and birthing process. It is not the fact of being pregnant that is a form of indentured servitude; it is the imposition by force of might by a government that would create that situation. &#8220;Indentured servitude&#8221; is basically the situation someone is put in where they have to do as a master says until they complete certain labor obligations at which time they may be set free &#8211; with the OK of the master.\n \n \n Also, if I understand the term correctly, a person convicted of a crime and sent to prison might have had the government impose a form of indentured servitude on [the prisoner] for what they chose to do with part of their body.\nThat has actually been discussed in Penal Law, and you are right, it is a thin line. There is a case to be made that at times prisoners have been treated like indentured servants.",

Perhaps you had forgotten that you were responding to my statement about a government forcing a woman to continue a nine month long gestation period and a mandatory labor and birthing process. It is not the fact of being pregnant that is a form of indentured servitude; it is the imposition by force of might by a government that would create that situation. \"Indentured servitude\" is basically the situation someone is put in where they have to do as a master says until they complete certain labor obligations at which time they may be set free - with the OK of the master.\n If by forcing someone not to kill someone else you mean indentured servitude then I guess that is what it is.\n \n\n That has actually been discussed in Penal Law, and you are right, it is a thin line.

That is grammar 101.\n \n \nConsidering we are talking about an object I suggest you use the noun 'human'.\nThen how do I differentiate the ovum in a woman's ovaries from the ovum in a monkey's ovaries? I can't say human ovum? Can I say monkey ovum?\n \n \nWho is taking charge of what?

The difference is I do not want to force the women in your life to live by my beliefs like you want to force the women in my life to live by yours.\n \n I trust my wife and my daughters and the gifts God has given them more than I trust a government. That is really the crux of the difference between you and I. I do not want to give a government to have power over my loved ones bodies. I believe that the creator endowed them with the ovum and that is how I think it should remain. I don't trust Bill Clinton or George Bush or John Roberts or Ruth Bader Ginsberg with decisions that I believe are between a woman, her husband, their family, their minister, and God. You do.

   "Howard Beale and Sigma - thank you for your comments. I have tried to figure out for myself where I stand on the abortion issue by trying to thoroughly analyze my own emotional reactions and views to try to come up with some self-consistent stand. It is so very easy to get caught up with the emotion of heated discussion (on any issue for that matter) that it is always useful to step back and re-analyze all of the emotional and logical steps which lead us to a particular point of view. These views on fetal development and abortion are the result of my self-analysis of my own views (which themselves are still a work in progress). Each person may have different results, but, for everyone, I believe that systematic self-analysis can be a useful process. Along those lines, I would love to hear more from people about the emotional underpinnings which lie below their moral or ethical beliefs.\nAssuming we did not have the technology to know when one may suffer, would your opinion change because you do not know?\nThen, I would probably be torn. If we really had no idea, then I personally would probably err on the side of caution and be personally against abortion. However, laws have to be based on a higher degree of certainty, so I would still think that laws against abortion of early embryos would not be able to be formed until it was more certain that such early embryos can suffer. Meanwhile, if I thought that there was a chance of early embryos experiencing pain, then I would advocate for at least having the embryo get anesthetized before the abortion procedure - just in case.\n \n Luckily for women needing time to choose to have an abortion, that is not the case. Science tells us that such early embryos cannot suffer.",

   "It seems to me that the word \"human\" in \"human being\" is also an adjective decribing what kind of being one is referring to.\n\n \n I agree. Human is used as an adjective and being is used as a noun.\n \n \nLikewise, when one uses the word \"person,\" as I think rather obvious, it is necessary to define what a person is. Otherwise, we debate an ambiguity. \nI agree again.\n \n \nFor instance, what is it about the nature of \"personhood\" or \"humanhood\" that includes born humans but not unborn humans? According to what standards are we to draw that line?\nThat is part of the discussion we were having when it got sidetracked with semantics. We could not reach a meeting of the minds on that question. I don't think everyone will ever be able to. \n \n I believe - as is told in the book of Genesis - Gen 2:7: And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. - that God formed the vessel of the soul first (in Genesis from the dirt) and after that \"breathed\" a soul into it and only then did man become a living soul.\n \n When that happens in the woman's womb, I have no idea and I don't think anyone else knows either. I do know that Genesis makes a point of differentiating between the \"formed man\" and the \"living soul\", that Genesis makes a point of showing the process in phases or steps (first, form; second, breath; finally, and only then, life) and I know that the creator placed this process and all its phases in the woman in a way that the \"formed man of the dust\" was more than close to the woman, but was in her. Using her blood, using her nutrients in a way no one except one who has been pregnant can comprehend. I believe it is a major arrogance to think that a government can know more than the woman or can make a better decision than the woman with regard to that \"formed man of the dust\". I believe it is such a mystical God experience and responsibility that we should help and pray and support and nurture, and not hand it over to a government.\n \n I have to tell you, if push came to shove and one of my daughters were pregnant and she said to me, \"Dad, there is something wrong\" and her doctors (I would encourage her to go for two or three opinions) told her, \"Yes, there is something abnormal, but we don't know what it is\" and after she had prayed on it she came to me and said, \"Dad, God told me I need to abort this pregnancy\", I would trust her more than Bill Clinton or George Bush or the Congress or the Supreme Court. I would help her carry out what she believed was God's will. I would use everything in my power to help her. A pregnant woman's connection to the realities are greater than a government's and as Jesus taught, there are higher laws than a government could ever establish. That may be why Jesus never told his followers to lobby the government to make his teachings into law.",

This possibility had actually been discussed in one thread here - \"A hypothetical question - artificial wombs\" - where Tastyfish had brought up the good point that the costs of running and maintaining such an artificial womb would probably be very high. If that would indeed be the case, and the government or sufficient number of potential adopters would not be willing to pay for it, then most women would still be left with two choices - abortion or forced continued pregnancy, so this might be a point of contention in any such compromise.\n \n From curiosity, I had originally assumed that such an artificial womb is farther off in the future (say 30 years).

If we use it in the adjective then we could just apply it as describing the kind of species the noun would go with (if that makes sense). For example human toe would mean the toe is of a human. So saying human adult, human child, human fetus, human embryo really doesn't say too much other then that the embryo is human. However, embryo qualifies for the noun sense of the word or \"a human\" as you call it. The adult also qualifies for the very same reasons. The embryo then qualifies for \"human being\" as this is just like \"human adult\" only 'being' is being used to enclose all children, adults, newborn and unborns. Person is just another word for human although this word has been changed since the abortion debate. This is why we get people claiming a difference in person and human. Although what they don't realize is you don't need to find differences in words to make your case.

The football team still is what it is, the unborn is exactly as he/she was even if person and human mean the same thing or not.

   "Some do percieve them differently. From what I've gathered, Howard can view 'human' as a human body without a brain, but it would never be a person.\nThis is such a difficult question because everyone seems to have a political agenda about it, so words get parsed and twisted, trick questions are asked. Verbal traps are set. It becomes demeaning. -- And, sad to say, I have been guilty of some of that behavior myself. It is too serious an issue to treat the way we all do.\n \n The real issue that underlies the perverse way we discuss this is whether or not a government should be given power in this area. If that were not the case, then extreme pro-lifers would be able to say, \"If I get pregnant I will carry to term no matter what - even if it threatens my life - it is my choice. And if my underage daughter gets pregnant, I will tell the doctors that they must save the fetus at all costs - no matter what my underage daughter wants.\" And extreme pro-choicers would be able to say, \"I keep the option open and whether you think the fetus is a person at six seconds, six minutes, six days, six weeks, or six months, as long as it is part of my body I don't care what you think, if I want to terminate my pregnancy, I will. And if my underage daughter gets pregnant, I will make sure she has an abortion no matter what she thinks.\"\n \n Just to clarify my thoughts, I have said that when the fetus is in the womb, the woman is the one with the greatest knowledge of that fetus. I have said that in my experience, the woman has an intuitive sense of the fetus. A woman can sense that there is something wrong before a doctor on many occasions. Also, the person is not a body. That is clear because at death the person is gone but the body is still there. There is that of us that is not the body, we have a body. If we were the body, then as long as the body existed we would exist. The body exists after we have left it, so we cannot be the body. As far as when the fertilized ovum becomes a person... I am not sure that anyone truly knows. So my position is to trust the mother. The reasoning around that position is not scientific or legalistic. Since I acknowledge that I so not know. My tendency is to trust the creator and the creation. The woman has the ovum as part of her and I have no understanding as to why. That is simply my belief, no more and no less.",
