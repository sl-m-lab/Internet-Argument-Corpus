For an act to be immoral it needs to have bad consequences, and the person performing the act must mean to do it and be capable of choosing to not do it. Causing an accident isn't immoral, nor is causing harm if you are incapable of not casuing harm. If, for example, your brain is broken in such a way that you can't prevent yourself from hitting people than you aren't immoral, you're just sick.\n \n Now, since being gay doesn't hurt anyone, the moral debate ought to end there. However, not everyone is convinced of this. Therefore some people try the other approach and say that even if you think being gay is harmful it's still not immoral because you have no choice in the matter, you're born gay. You might as well say it's immoral to have red hair. Of course, if the consequences part doesn't convince someone I find it unlikely that the motivation part will either.",

This erroneous conclusion was reached by folks with too much time on their hands and not enough knowledge to understand the natural world. Sadly, it stuck.\n \n With clear evidence that homosexuality exists in other species and in the face of growing evidence that it has a strong genetic/biological component in humans, MOST of Christianity is trying to come to terms with the loss of the \"natural\" argument. Much of mainstream Protestantism is carving out a place for us. Catholicism, being the origin of the \"unnatural\" argument, is struggling and is in deep denial about the conflict between what it \"knows\" and what it knows (largely because so much other theology rests on the same shoulders that came up with the argument).

   "this goes to show how well statistics tell us the the relationship of 2 events. lets design this experiment. we have a well respected christian pastor, or better yet a team of praying christians. we give them a list of say 200 names of pregnant women and a gender next to each name that the mother would like him to pray for. they go through the list and pray for god to make each mother give birth to the gender they want. then we have another list of another 200 pregnant women. each of them also indicates the gender they hope for next to their names. but these requests are not prayed for\n \n when all these mothers deliver, it is found that 45% of the mothers that were prayed for got the baby gender they wanted, and 30% of the mothers that were not prayed for got the gender they wanted. would you conclude from this that pray affects the gender of a baby of a pregnant woman?\n\n \n The problem with your example is that we both know it wouldn't work that way in real life. Gender is random, so 50% of the women should get the gender they hope for, we know this. Your numbers are saying that those who pray get the random result and those who don't pray get a bizarre result. Am I supposed to ignore reality when answering your question, and pretend that this is the only data I have?\n \n \n \n\n every once in a while we hear about scientific discoveries that a few months later are found to be false. i cant think of any off hand. i vaguely remember at one time there was the claim that aspirin was dangerous to take. this was great news for competing headache medicines. now, it seems, aspirin actually has the most health benefits, again, according to scientists, and the aspirin market is gradually recovering.\n\n Like I said, the more studies you have, the greater confidence you have in the results. Some initial conclusions will turn out to not be correct, but the only way to find that out is to publish and have others try to confirm your results.\n \n \n \n\n i have never seen a single study on what causes gayness that has ever taken into consideration the possibility that individual choice may be a factor. maybe i've missed them, or they dont get published because the results arent interesting\n\n You didn't quite answer my question.

   "I'll try to address each of those points.\n \n 1) Wild animals. If you read about chimpanzees in the wild, you'd discover that male-male homosexuality and lesbianism are manifested. Some female chimps have sex for pleasure with their own gender, and only with a male to mate (understandably). I did a simple google search and it turned up a few examples (bison, gazelle) which have sex with their own until they're ready to breed. Have you even tried to look for a study on wild animals or were you happy to believe it only involved captive animals?\n \n 2) Behavior. Every behavior can be said to be \"linked\" to the environment. This doesn't prove or disprove a genetic basis and is a waste of bytes. For instance, everyone I've met with a missing finger had some kind of accident. That doesn't mean genetics do not determine the number of fingers.\n If you're serious about learning the genetic basis of some behavior, here is a suggested search: \"violence adoption criminal parents.\" It should lead you to explore other studies as well. Also, intelligence is highly correlated to one's genetic makeup. Compiled tests on twins, separated twins, siblings, adopted children in the same home, etc, the results to see how intelligence is correlated looks like this (where 100 is perfect identity and 0 is random difference):\n Same person tested twice 87, Twins reared apart 76, Siblings 47, Adopted children living together 0. This is from Matt Ridley's Genome, and it cites studies if you're interested.\n There were others I've mentioned, but lack of fear is my favorite. Suggested reading: \"psychopaths.\"\n There are even genes linked to risk-taking. Read about this, it's quite interesting.\n \n 3) Youth. For this I'd like to talk about a story I saw on 20/20 (I believe). I hate the fact that I don't remember when I saw it and can't cite it. I know you will not look for any references that can contradict your opinion; so hopefully I can find it. Anyway, a 14 year old son of a very religious father committed suicide because he knew it was a sin to be gay. This doesn't prove the biological explanation, but it does cast doubt on the belief that I'm straight solely because \"you were instilled with values, habits, knowledge of actions and consequences, expectations and behavioral patterns.\" The 14 year old had even stronger reinforcement of these beliefs, yet we should believe the complex explanation that he \"chose\" to be gay and committed suicide because of this, rather than asserting it was something he did not choose. One explanation is simpler than the other.\n \n I usually don't leave links in discussions like these because I believe the other debater hasn't done their homework and seriously looked at both sides. C'mon, you're telling me you didn't know chimps practiced homosexuality?\n \n Moreover, onto your twin rebuttal: it's over half! When you compare that to the general population as a whole, why would twin sexuality correlate that highly as compared to the general population? Why would the twins' sexuality correlate higher than biological siblings raised in the same environment? Why would it correlate more than even fraternal twins? Behavior is more malleable than eye color, so we would expect twins to differ in that respect. I'm afraid you're denying the gene due to its manifestation. To assume that no behavior has a genetic basis when there are 20-25 thousand genes in our bodies seems foolhardy.",

If it's beneficial to being replicated, then the fact that it produces homosexuality in men is a by-product of the gene's selfish motives. People are assuming this gene \"wants\" males to be gay.

(You may misunderstand the term, familial. It means family/environmental influence that may or may not be genetic). What you fail to glean from the twin studies is the difference between identical and fraternal twins and other siblings. This \"controls\" for familial influences. Twin studies are a time-honored methodology for considering genetic influences. You seem to have misunderstood the crucial element of this kind of study.\n \n \n \n actually, this is apparently not the case [that sexual orientation is not changeable]. i assume youve never visited this site. this can be viewed as evidence that contradicts the assertion you just made\n\n \n No, I never visited that site prior to your suggestion. Even though it is a \"pro-gay\" site, I would not use such a subjective source for medical/biological (ie, scientific) information. You can find any information to back any point you want if you limit yourself to websites like that. Try some thing like the  American Psychological Associaton site. This information is there:\n \n \"Is Sexual Orientation a Choice? \n \n No, human beings can not choose to be either gay or straight. Sexual orientation emerges for most people in early adolescence without any prior sexual experience. Although we can choose whether to act on our feelings, psychologists do not consider sexual orientation to be a conscious choice that can be voluntarily changed. \n \n \n Can Therapy Change Sexual Orientation? \n \n No. Even though most homosexuals live successful, happy lives, some homosexual or bisexual people may seek to change their sexual orientation through therapy, sometimes pressured by the influence of family members or religious groups to try and do so. The reality is that homosexuality is not an illness. It does not require treatment and is not changeable.\"\n \n I apologize for not quoting the original sources supporting this position. A search of the MedLine or PsychInfo databases would do that.\n \n Addend. Attached is a nice review of reparative therapy from a peer reviewed journal.",

   "the twin study has been brought up numerous times. identical twins have identical genetic structuring. you could not look at the genes of 2 identical twins and tell them apart. the fact that almost half of the sets of identical twins did NOT have identical sexual orientations is very strong evidence that genetics do not cause or even influence sexual orientation. how do we account for the 48% occurencr of differing sexualities between the sets of identical twins?\n \n\n \n Actually, it's very strong evidence that there is an influence. Normally there a 5-10 % chance of someone being gay. But if your twin is gay then there's a 50% chance that you'll be gay. That's a very strong correlation.\n \n What you don't seem to understand is that when it comes to behavior genes aren't an on-off switch. It's not the case that if you have a certain gene then you'll act like X, and without it you'll act like Y. They just increase or decrease the likelyhood of certain behaviors. For example, there is an alchoholism gene, this has been proven. If you have it, it doesn't mean that you will definately become an alchoholic. It just makes it much more likely. If there is a gay gene than having it wouldn't necessarily guarantee that you'll be gay, it could just greatly increase the chances. The twins study seems to support that idea.",

   "I'll try to address each of those points.\n \n 1) Wild animals. If you read about chimpanzees in the wild, you'd discover that male-male homosexuality and lesbianism are manifested. Some female chimps have sex for pleasure with their own gender, and only with a male to mate (understandably). I did a simple google search and it turned up a few examples (bison, gazelle) which have sex with their own until they're ready to breed. Have you even tried to look for a study on wild animals or were you happy to believe it only involved captive animals?\n\n like i said, all the articles i've ever encountered that talked about observing homosexual behavior among animals referred to their subjects as animals in captivity. i havent seen any articles that showed any animals behave ths way in the wild. ill do a search about the chimapnzees, as this may be something recently published\n \n \n2) Behavior. Every behavior can be said to be \"linked\" to the environment. This doesn't prove or disprove a genetic basis and is a waste of bytes. For instance, everyone I've met with a missing finger had some kind of accident. That doesn't mean genetics do not determine the number of fingers.\n If you're serious about learning the genetic basis of some behavior, here is a suggested search: \"violence adoption criminal parents.\" It should lead you to explore other studies as well. Also, intelligence is highly correlated to one's genetic makeup. Compiled tests on twins, separated twins, siblings, adopted children in the same home, etc, the results to see how intelligence is correlated looks like this (where 100 is perfect identity and 0 is random difference):\n Same person tested twice 87, Twins reared apart 76, Siblings 47, Adopted children living together 0. This is from Matt Ridley's Genome, and it cites studies if you're interested.\n There were others I've mentioned, but lack of fear is my favorite. Suggested reading: \"psychopaths.\"\n There are even genes linked to risk-taking. Read about this, it's quite interesting.\n\n intelligence is neither a behavior nor a preference. i am aware that genetics control physical and chemical capabilities, such as athletic ability, metabolism, nervous suppression, memory, sexual libido, etc. these are functional traits, and may influence one's identity. but we are talking about prefernce and habits, and i have never seen a study that shows people are born with a prefernce or habit that is permanent or not learned\n \n \n3) Youth. For this I'd like to talk about a story I saw on 20/20 (I believe). I hate the fact that I don't remember when I saw it and can't cite it. I know you will not look for any references that can contradict your opinion; so hopefully I can find it. Anyway, a 14 year old son of a very religious father committed suicide because he knew it was a sin to be gay. This doesn't prove the biological explanation, but it does cast doubt on the belief that I'm straight solely because \"you were instilled with values, habits, knowledge of actions and consequences, expectations and behavioral patterns.\" The 14 year old had even stronger reinforcement of these beliefs, yet we should believe the complex explanation that he \"chose\" to be gay and committed suicide because of this, rather than asserting it was something he did not choose. One explanation is simpler than the other.\n\n there is actually nothing unusual about this kind of situation. i've heard of it before. this boy apparently believed that his religious image meant more than his freedom to live the way he wanted to. this is how instilled values affect us. he also apparently believed that his homosexuality was permanent and there was nothing that could be done about it.trapped in this kind of mental catch-22, there was no way out.\n \n it doesnt mean that homosexuality is inate, and it doesnt mean that it was chosen either. the question is, how did he become gay. all i can conclude is that this boy believed he was gay, and he believe that he would be gay all his life, and that he could not face life being such a disappointment to his family and community\n \n \nI usually don't leave links in discussions like these because I believe the other debater hasn't done their homework and seriously looked at both sides. C'mon, you're telling me you didn't know chimps practiced homosexuality?\n\n again, like i said, homosexuality among chimp, and lots of other animals, have been reported lots of times. i've read lots of articles. the point i'm making, is that every article that ever made such a report has only observed this behavir among animals in captivity. do you see the difference?\n \n \nMoreover, onto your twin rebuttal: it's over half! When you compare that to the general population as a whole, why would twin sexuality correlate that highly as compared to the general population? Why would the twins' sexuality correlate higher than biological siblings raised in the same environment? Why would it correlate more than even fraternal twins? Behavior is more malleable than eye color, so we would expect twins to differ in that respect. I'm afraid you're denying the gene due to its manifestation. To assume that no behavior has a genetic basis when there are 20-25 thousand genes in our bodies seems foolhardy.\n\n yes, slightly over half. quite a large number of identical twins are also raised identically, or as close as possible. they are made to wear the same outfits, eat the same foods, play the same sports, and pretty much live the same way. of course as they grow older they differentiate, but the fact that they are drilled to adapt the same habits at an early stage in life cannot be ignored.\n \n you need to explain why there isnt a 100% correlation between the sexual orientation of identical twins",

   "Even though the site can be said to be biased, I guess it has some points. However, no scientist asserted there was a \"gay gene.\" This was done by the media as homosexuality is still a hot topic for some reason. The gene was found on the X chromosome. It is highly possible that this gene does not \"care\" about its effects on the male body, it could promote something within the female body. If it's beneficial to being replicated, then the fact that it produces homosexuality in men is a by-product of the gene's selfish motives. People are assuming this gene \"wants\" males to be gay. People are still under the belief that genes somehow are there for our benefit, when it is really the opposite.\n\n gays claim that science has evidence that homosexuality is (or may be) genetic. evidence of a possibilty of something is evidence of a non-possibilty as well. there is also evidence that homosexuality may be based on choice. there is also evidence that homosexuality may be caused by environment. however, we dont like to discuss the evidence that supports the other possibilities because they go against our already decided conclusions",

   "I have already conceded that there may be some familial influences. (You may misunderstand the term, familial. It means family/environmental influence that may or may not be genetic). What you fail to glean from the twin studies is the difference between identical and fraternal twins and other siblings. This \"controls\" for familial influences. Twin studies are a time-honored methodology for considering genetic influences. You seem to have misunderstood the crucial element of this kind of study.\n\n the difference between the incidence of correlating gay identical twins and non-identical twins may be based on the psychological presure identical twins are under to be identical. like i said above, most parent raise their identical twins to be identical in every aspect, including mentally and behaviorally. if a twin achieves something, the other is immediately excpeted, even if only preceived, to acheive the same to maintain being equal. think about it. can this be ruled out?\n \n \nNo, I never visited that site prior to your suggestion. Even though it is a \"pro-gay\" site, I would not use such a subjective source for medical/biological (ie, scientific) information. You can find any information to back any point you want if you limit yourself to websites like that. \n Try some thing like the  American Psychological Associaton site. This information is there:\n \n \"Is Sexual Orientation a Choice? \n \n No, human beings can not choose to be either gay or straight. Sexual orientation emerges for most people in early adolescence without any prior sexual experience. Although we can choose whether to act on our feelings, psychologists do not consider sexual orientation to be a conscious choice that can be voluntarily changed. \n\n the sources of \"evidence\" concerning whether homosexuality can be chosen is based on subjective opinions. \"scientists\" provide gays with a survey, on which is the question \"did you choose to be gay?\" if the unanimous answer is \"no\", then this is considered evidence that gays dont chose to be gay. the problem, obviously, is that the method by which they found this \"evidence\" is subjective. i would like to see an objective method for determining if homosexuality is a choice or not\n \n \nCan Therapy Change Sexual Orientation? \n \n No. Even though most homosexuals live successful, happy lives, some homosexual or bisexual people may seek to change their sexual orientation through therapy, sometimes pressured by the influence of family members or religious groups to try and do so. The reality is that homosexuality is not an illness. It does not require treatment and is not changeable.\"\n \n I apologize for not quoting the original sources supporting this position. A search of the MedLine or PsychInfo databases would do that.\n \n Addend. Attached is a nice review of reparative therapy from a peer reviewed journal.\n\n the site says that sexual orientation is not changeable. this is subjective, unless shown otherwise. the site i linked says that sexual orientation is not only changable, but is based on choice. is there a reason why one subjective opinion should get more merit than another?",

Changing the concentration of a chemical, or adding or deleting something from the mix, could have anywhere from a profound to an extremely subtle effect on your behavior. Human sexual preference is clearly a complex system, with many different things influencing it. If there is a gay gene it would just be one more bit of input pushing your desires in a particular direction.

   "genes, from what we know about them, are on/off switches. they dictate the physical features and structure of the body. a person born with the genes that causes green eyes will inevitably have green eyes.\n \n according to what your are saying, we are expected to assume that some genes are on/off switches, and some genes arent. besides the fact that we have already isolated and identified gene sections that control eye-color, for example, we have never identified genes that control or \"influence\" behavior. \n \n now, bear in mind, im aware of studies in which genetic alterations have made animals behave in different ways. for example, mice have been bred with a gene section disabled that caused them to act aggressive and even violently. also, genes have been shown to control metabolism, sex drive, appetite, visual perception, and a lot of other functions. however, in every situation, the affected gene always acted as an on/off switch. the gene effect always affected 100% of the altered subjects, unless some other genetic switch was also affecting what was done.\n \n this provides further clues as to how genes work. if behaviors are tentaively or unreliably affected by genes, then this would seem to contradict nearly everything genetic research has taught us thus far\n\n \n To Unkerpaulie:\n \n Genetics isn't really that simple. Gene expression is often positively or negatively regulated by repressors, activators, enhancers, etc. Some genes may be expressed constitutively at low levels, and induced occasionally. You have to take into account codominance, pseudodominance, and incomplete dominance. Leaky mutations can cause proteins with a low residual function to be produced.\n \n Regarding your example of eye colour, this would be an example of discontinuous variation, where a character in a population has two or more distinct and separate phenotypes. This type of variation has been heavily researched because it is simpler and easier to analyze than continuous variation, but I think something like sexual orientation would probably be more complicated. \n \n Continuous variation is more common. There is not a one to one correspondence of genotype and phenotype, and both the genotype and the environment contribute to the genotype. This is hard to research, so we don't know a lot about these genes yet.\n \n I think you would be interested in \"penetrance\" and \"expressivity\". Penetrance is the percentage of individuals with an allele that actually have the associated phenotype.

I also personally feel the radical left's pro-gay agenda is coercive and / or harmful to society for the following reasons:\n\n I consider the imposition of religion into the laws I and every other gay person has to live under harmfull to society. Just because you consider something sinful is irelevant and not important in a secular society. See you want me to be forced to live by your rules because of your personal beliefs.Whereas no one is forcing you to be gay, have gay sex ,or live a gay lifestlye. This is not the case with your Christian cohorts tring to ruin peoples lives by trying to turn them into heterosexuals.\n \n \n \n\n First, \"gay pride\" (two sins). They flaunt it in our faces and try to legitimize it. You don't hear of \"adultery pride\" parades or \"necrophilia pride\" parades do you? But even if there were we'd take an equally stellar stance against those. We don't want to hear about it.\nI see to see Irish pride, I see other ethnic prides, and I see christians flaunting their religion, all the time and also this is irrelevant in a secular society. I am as free to flaunt my gay pride in your face as you are to flaunt your religion in my face. I will make a deal with you. You stop flaunting and practicing your religion and I will give up my gay pride. Deal?\n \n \n \n \n\n Second, most homosexuals who claim to be Christian try to persuade others it's not a sin, leading many into perdition. We don't want to see even one soul lost. \n\n Also none of your business that is between the gay christian and God. To many Gay christians God has spoken to them and blesses them every day. Have you ever met a gay christian or even attended a gay church? I bet the answer is no.\n \n \n\n Third, most homosexuals distort the scriptures in some fashion or another in order to try to justify their sin. The distort who Jesus is (saying he's not God so he never spoke out against gay sex sin); they make lengthly arguments against Leviticus, Romans 1:26-27, I Corinthians 6:9-10, etc. Generally, they attack the Word of God and thus attack God himself. \n\n When you follow all, and I mean all, down to the dietary laws of leviticus so will I.

Read Deuteronomy chapter 28 to see the curses of disobedience.\n\n Once again Irrelevant in a secular society. Besides I said this once I call upon your God to smite me. Better to burn in hell for an eternity then to spend one nanosecond in heaven with hatefilled selfrightious christians.\n \n \n \n\n Fifth, they attack the Sons and Daughters of God when we stand up for the truth of God's Word. They call us bigots, homophobes, and all manner of names because we disagree with their stance.\n\n The truth hurts doesn't it? It is after all our lives, our families, and our civil rights you are fighting against. Besides bigot and homophobe are tame compaired to the ugly names your cohorts have called us.\n \n \n \n\n Sixth, they push their illicit agenda into every corner of America.

We don't need to know which way people perform sex acts. \n\n So it is allright for them to hear about heterosexuality? But according to you I should have heterosexality and the heterosexual agenda pushed in my face. It works both ways if I have to view heterosexuals and thier agenda then heterosexuals have to view the gay agenda. I doubt seriously that any one is telling a 9 year old about adult sex. I do expect children to be taught that there are different families in the world and some of those familes have a mommy and a daddy, 2 daddies, 2 mommies, or just a mommie or just a daddy. You can not expect to hide real families from them forever. You might as well stand on the beach and try and stop the tide from wipping out your heterosexually privleged world. The boy scouts are free to exclude whom ever they want. Just don't expect me as a gay tax payer to have to fund their hatred and excultion of me and my people. \n \n \n \n\n Seventh: (need I go on?) They (and heterosexual sinners) cost taxpayers untold billions in unnecessary health care costs to treat AIDS and other diseases that they give to each other. It costs us all money out of our pockets.\n\n Do you have any proof of this statement? Better to spend money to treat and fight HIV then to give it to some Christian organization to prop up their evil preachers and to fund their evil war against gay people.\n \n \n \n\n And eighth: They usually bring their \"children\" up with a distorted view of sin and God, which can lead new generations of people into perdition and the loss of eternal life. \n\n \n Once again irrelevant in a secular society.

You care so much about gays that you will continue to make them feel like outcasts, and continue to save them from corrupting others into a road to hell. You don't want to see one soul lost yet you have no problem hating and discriminating against people based on their sexuality. Like a true Christian (true fundamentalist Christian that is, sorry to you real Christians out there).\n \n \n \n \n\n Fifth, they attack the Sons and Daughters of God when we stand up for the truth of God's Word.

We don't need to know which way people perform sex acts. \n \n\n The straight agenda is pushed into every corner of America. Elementary and all other schools are shown movies, read books, and told stories about men and women living together. Nine year old children shouldn't have to hear that their daddy is actually doing their mom, or that it's ok to do it. Straights push their agenda in everyones' faces until gays are quite sick of it. Imagine every single love story having 2 men or 2 women rather than a man and a woman, and the moral of many stories being that it's important to have a life-long partner to rely on, the partner being of the same sex. Then you'll have a dose of what gays have to deal with.\n \n \n\n Seventh: (need I go on?) They (and heterosexual sinners) cost taxpayers untold billions in unnecessary health care costs to treat AIDS and other diseases that they give to each other.

Can you imagine a gay group that wouldn't allow straight members then asking for federal money?\n\n \n They don't need your federal money anymore. \n \n \nSo you aren't proud to be an American, proud of your standing in life, proud of your faith, etc.?\n\n \n Absolutely.\n \n \nGays get diseases, and straights get diseases.

But the Word of God has already provided it. \n \n \nSome of us prefer to live life today and don't believe in eternal salvation. It would be nice if you don't legislate the way other people have sex and raise a family and you will see a decrease in the terms homophobe and Christianazi. Gays will have sex no matter what. They will live together and raise children. What harm does it do to recognize their partnership as marriage? Is the actual calling it marriage a sin?\n\n \n We'll offer up any legislation we think is right according to the Word of God. And you can do the same according to your viewpoints.

   "A great many of us Christians will continue to oppose, via legitimate legislative and judicial means, any laws which seek to normalize gay marriage, which we consider a sinful institution. I also personally feel the radical left's pro-gay agenda is coercive and / or harmful to society for the following reasons:\n \n First, \"gay pride\" (two sins). They flaunt it in our faces and try to legitimize it. You don't hear of \"adultery pride\" parades or \"necrophilia pride\" parades do you? But even if there were we'd take an equally stellar stance against those. We don't want to hear about it.\n \n Second, most homosexuals who claim to be Christian try to persuade others it's not a sin, leading many into perdition. We don't want to see even one soul lost. \n \n Third, most homosexuals distort the scriptures in some fashion or another in order to try to justify their sin. The distort who Jesus is (saying he's not God so he never spoke out against gay sex sin); they make lengthly arguments against Leviticus, Romans 1:26-27, I Corinthians 6:9-10, etc. Generally, they attack the Word of God and thus attack God himself. \n \n Fourth: Sin is a reproach to individuals and nations and brings God's disfavor on men and nations. Read Deuteronomy chapter 28 to see the curses of disobedience.\n \n Fifth, they attack the Sons and Daughters of God when we stand up for the truth of God's Word. They call us bigots, homophobes, and all manner of names because we disagree with their stance.\n \n Sixth, they push their illicit agenda into every corner of America. Suing the Boy Scouts and anyone else who disagrees with them. They try and sometimes succeed in pushing their gay agenda in elementary schools and elsewhere where it doesn't belong. Nine year old children shouldn't have to hear that Billy's daddy is doing another guy, or that it's ok to do it. They push their agenda in our faces until we're quite sick of it. We don't need to know which way people perform sex acts. \n \n Seventh: (need I go on?) They (and heterosexual sinners) cost taxpayers untold billions in unnecessary health care costs to treat AIDS and other diseases that they give to each other. It costs us all money out of our pockets.\n \n And eighth: They usually bring their \"children\" up with a distorted view of sin and God, which can lead new generations of people into perdition and the loss of eternal life. \n \n And there's more but that's for starters.\n\n \n \n Easy - if I ever come face to face with your stupid God and he asks me why I hate him so, I promise to mention YOU.\n \n Take your ugly religion and stick it where the sun don't shine. You have no business demanding the entire of society live by its rules. NONE. Neither law nor your stupid Bible condone or expect forced adhearence. All you want is your personal, selfish unsupportable hate justified. \n \n You crossed the line here - one of those \"children\" is MINE. And if that is how any Christian talks about any child - you, and they, and your stupid God can all go to HELL.",

Just as any private organization, they have the right to exclude whoever they want.\n \n \n \n \n\n Pride in ungodly things is the qualifier. \n \n\n So it wasn't the pride that's a sin, it was the bad thing. Obviously if something is bad, pride in it would naturally be bad, but that's just in your eyes.\n \n \n\n Tell me how, unless they got it from someone or something foreign to their marriage.\n \n\n hmm, how did AIDS start? Why not just only have sex with virgins or people who have made sure that their partners were virgins or had only had sex with virgins, etc. back down the line. Would that work?\n \n \n\n Freedom of religion is in the Constitution. Gay marriage isn't.\n \n\n So is free speech, yet we have free speech zones and you need a permit to protest sometimes. So is the right to bear arms, yet we have laws that require permits and ban some weapons. We could say we're not banning religion, we're banning churches. It is also illegal for the federal government to ban gay marriage, barring a Constitutional amendment. But I'm not even talking about legality, you have ducked the issue. I'm talking about bashing in general. If people tried to ban churches, legal or not, you would consider it bashing religion, even though they aren't necessary to religion (as gay marriage isn't necessary to gayness).\n \n \n\n Gays and fornicators can control their sexual behaviors by abstaining in order to honor God's Word. People can't control their skin color, and skin color isn't a sin like gay sex is. There's no comparison. I also think many blacks would be offended by that comparison.\n\n \n Again twisting my words. I was comparing the movements, not the religious aspect. I said that at one time blacks and slaves were in the minority, so slavery was the law of the land. Right now gay marriage is illegal almost everywhere. Gays are in the minority, but there's no reason they can't gain enough support just as slaves did.",

   "A great many of us Christians will continue to oppose, via legitimate legislative and judicial means, any laws which seek to normalize gay marriage, which we consider a sinful institution. I also personally feel the radical left's pro-gay agenda is coercive and / or harmful to society for the following reasons:\n\n \n 1) I feel your response is part of the problem. You confuse the CAPABILITY of gays to have all the rights that straights have with \"normalizing\" it.\n Gay marriage is legal in Massachusetts.\n Do you think it is \"normal\" there now?\n \n Just because something is legal doesn't make it \"normal\". Nor does it mean that it's societally accepted.\n \n 2) \"coercive and / or harmful to society\"\n We'll go through your reasons individually, but you should know that the research doesn't support your claims.\n And looking through your response, I can't help but notice that you have focused a lot of your efforts into quoting the bible. And that is, quite frankly, and unconstitutional justification for violating rights...\n \n \n \nFirst, \"gay pride\" (two sins). They flaunt it in our faces and try to legitimize it. You don't hear of \"adultery pride\" parades or \"necrophilia pride\" parades do you? But even if there were we'd take an equally stellar stance against those. We don't want to hear about it.\n\n That's funny.\n I don't want to hear about your Christianity either.\n I don't want it \"flaunted\" in my face either...\n \n Can we come to a truce?\n \n Or are we just going to pick and choose what YOU don't want to hear about...\n \n In this country, we have freedom of speech. If you don't want to see a gay pride parade, then don't attend. It's just that simple.\n How many gay pride parades have you been forced to attend?\n How many gay pride parades have you actually attended...\n \n \n \nSecond, most homosexuals who claim to be Christian try to persuade others it's not a sin, leading many into perdition. We don't want to see even one soul lost. \n\n Irrelevant.\n That's within your own religion, and you're more than justified in having whatever arbitrary guidelines and rules within your own religion that you choose.\n \n I'm talking specifically about governmental issues...\n \n \n \nThird, most homosexuals distort the scriptures ...\n\n Again, don't care.\n This may be a justification for your RELIGIOUS standards, but it's meaningless as to why the GOVERNMENT should or should not recognize gay marriage...\n \n I'm skipping the rest of your religious statements, for that reason...\n If you feel they are still relevant to governmental law, then please explain why and I'll proceed...\n \n You're obviously free to have your religious beliefs, based on whatever arbitrary reason that you please.\n The government is held to higher standards...\n \n \"\"Our prior cases make two propositions abundantly clear. First, the fact that the governing majority in a State has traditionally viewed a particular practice as immoral is not a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting the practice; neither history nor tradition could save a law prohibiting miscegenation from constitutional attack.\"\n Lawrence v Texas\n \n Your morality, religious or otherwise, is not a sufficient reason to constitutionally restrict my rights...\n \n \n \nFifth, they attack the Sons and Daughters of God when we stand up for the truth of God's Word. They call us bigots, homophobes, and all manner of names because we disagree with their stance.\n\n You know, I couldn't pass this one by, specifically because it's particularly laughable...\n \n You are complaining to me because you don't like being called names?\n Do you know how many names I have been called because I am gay?\n \n I just felt that the other side of the issue should be pointed out regarding your statement...\n \n \n \nSixth, they push their illicit agenda into every corner of America. Suing the Boy Scouts and anyone else who disagrees with them. They try and sometimes succeed in pushing their gay agenda in elementary schools and elsewhere where it doesn't belong. Nine year old children shouldn't have to hear that Billy's daddy is doing another guy, or that it's ok to do it. They push their agenda in our faces until we're quite sick of it. We don't need to know which way people perform sex acts.\n\n Your statements demonstrate your OWN FIXATION instead of an actual reason...\n \n I don't see anybody saying that they want to explain to nine-year olds the intracies of gay sexual love. Please don't distort the issue with lies and hyperboles...\n \n Regardless, it's funny how you phrase this issue. They aren't suing \"anyone who disagrees with them\". That's another hyperbole on your part.\n They sue people who DISCRIMINATE against them. Like the boy scouts discriminating against homosexuals by excluding them.\n \n And I personally believe that the courts made the right decision in the boy scout case. For a PRIVATE organization, they should be able to make up their own minds about who they discriminate against. But the keywork is PRIVATE, and the organization that discriminates should be prepared to ensure that their organization is prepared to STAY PRIVATE in order to enjoy that freedom...\n \n \n \nSeventh: (need I go on?) They (and heterosexual sinners) cost taxpayers untold billions in unnecessary health care costs to treat AIDS and other diseases that they give to each other. It costs us all money out of our pockets.\n\n Gee. Do you know how much in taxes I am paying for heterosexuals having kids and the like?\n And I'ld be curious if you can substantiate your claim of \"billions\"...\n \n Moreover, the vast majority of homosexuals are HIV free. In fact, the actual percentage of homosexuals with HIV is about 1.2%. Meaning that 98.8% of homosexuals are HIV free.\n \n Do you regularly condemn an entire group based on what only 1.2% of the group is \"guilty\" of?\n \n \n \nAnd eighth: They usually bring their \"children\" up with a distorted view of sin and God, which can lead new generations of people into perdition and the loss of eternal life. \n\n OMG!\n You mean they ACTUALLY RAISE their kids with beliefs that differ from YOUR beliefs???\n How evil can these homosexuals be!!!\n (In case it needs to be explicitly stated, that was sarcasm.)\n \n Other people raising kids with beliefs that conflict with yours IS NOT a real complaint. It just isn't.\n It's a fact of life.\n Jews raise their kids with the belief that Christ wasn't God.\n Hindus raise their kids typically without any Judeo-Christian beliefs....\n \n Are they bad because of that?",

He's also the one who inspires all scriptures, which includes Romans 1:26-27 and I Corinthians 6:9-10.\n\n \n Did you even read my post? How do you reconcile Jesus's direct command in Mark 12:31 with the full scale religious rights war against gay families? Is the way anti gay christian groups treat gay people the way you want gay people to treat anti gay people?\n \n Do I have the right to lobby for the restriction of religion?",

   "Your are right to a point. It should not effect our lives and we should not let it but it is extrememly hard to ignor the person bashing you over the head with a bible. Wouldn't just be simpler if we could just wipe religion off the face of the earth.\n\n the bible is equally against common-law relationships. they often walk around preaching against people who \"shack up\" without getting married. but, its very obvious that the couples that arent married dont let the bashing affect them. you dont see scientific studies showing evidence that being a single parent or teenage promiscuity is genetic or biological, even though we have longer family histories of single mothers than gays. and you dont see the \"common-law\" community parading for their rights to live in common law relationships or trying to reinterpret the scripture for the church to try and accept them. \n \n the same is true for gamblers, prostitutes, alcoholics, wiccans, partiers and unscrupulous business people. and yet they dont take the bashing in a way that they feel the need to center their lives around it, as the gay community does. and dont say that the gays get bashed more than any other group. the only difference is that gays make a spectacle out of the fact that the religious right opposes them. the religious right opposes all of these other types of anti-biblical lifestyles, and in most churches they are all addressed equally in the average sermon. so to assume that gays are the only \"sinners\" being targetted by the church is totally wrong\n \n as for which is \"simpler\", religion isnt going anywhere anytime soon. what is actually simpler is for gays to recognize that being gay is just as \"natural\" as driving a saab, eating bean soup or getting a ph.d. just because the majority of people doesnt do something, that by no means makes it \"unnatural\". as gays you dont have to justify your lifestyle or motives to anybody, especially the religious right. you dont have to make excuses or beg for acceptance. if such a thing as \"gay pride\" exists, then why are gays covering behind all these fabrications and smoke screens? just life the way you want to live and to heck with who has an opinion about it\n \n as for \"oppression\", which is another popular gay buzzword, gays are not anymore oppressed than any other group. from a legal point of view, marriage was always about a man and a woman. there was never any law that defined marriage any other way. what gays are doing is trying to redefine the legal definition of marriage. focusing on the religious sector will not by any means help this cause. this is no different from petitioning that seat-belts be optional. the people who dont want to wear seat belts will claim that seat belt laws oppress them, but the fact is thats what the laws are. ALL laws inconvenience people, without exception. it doesnt mean that the laws are oppressive to that group. most of the gays that want the laws to change jump on the ignorant band-wagon of opposing the church or creating fake scientific cases. neither of these methods will do anything to affect the laws. the process to legally redifine marriage entails studying the history and details of the law, and lobbying to have it redefined by addressing the law makers DIRECTLY. everything else is just gays wasting time and being their own biggest obstacle",

   "gay sex is not illegal.\n\n NOW it isn't.\n A few years ago, it was illegal in a variety of states.\n My point, which you are trying to ignore, is that the \"discrimination\" against gays which you blindly try to ignore is, and was, very real.\n \n \nthey cant marry members of the same sex. thats not discrimination. its a law\n\n Do you actually need an education in the fact that laws CAN BE discriminatory?\n Here's a pop quiz for you. There used to be laws against interracial marriage.\n Using your logic, were they discriminatory?\n \n \nthe law simply doesnt recognize gay marriage as legal, because legally marriage is defined as a civil union between a man and a woman. it doesnt mean its right or wrong, its just what the law says. if you want to change the law, then you have to address the legal arena directly\n\n Would you like to start a legal discussion on why laws preventing gay marriage are unconstitutional?\n I'm ready...\n \n \nthat religious right also claimed that mardi gras revelers were responsible for hurricane katrina, and hinduism was responsible for the tsunami. are you seeing a pattern here?\n\n Can you show me examples of things they blamed on \"wiccans\" and similar nonsense, where gays weren't included?\n \n \nas for the republicans winning the election, wouldnt that work against what gays wanted? what would they have said if the democrats won? you gay supporters are giving the religious rught way too much power over how you go about your daily lives\n\n What \"power\" do they have over our daily lives????\n And HOW did we supposedly give them that \"power\"????\n If you think that gay rights issues have gotten worse because gays started fighting for equality, then you're delusional!\n I welcome you to substantiate that position, if you hold it...\n \n \ngays are only in \"focus\" because gays make themselves the center of attention.\n\n Chicken or the egg time, and you're missing the HUGE chicken standing in the room which has been sitting there for CENTURIES...\n Gays were discriminated against LONG BEFORE gays started fighting back against the discrimination.\n To pretend that our fighting against the discrimination is creating the attention is obtuse!\n \n \ngays want to marry, but rather than address the judicial dept, the only place where a difference can be made, you guys make it a religion vs gays issue.\n\n Wow. You are just really trying to be the cart pushing the horse, aren't you...\n RELIGION is at the forefront of the reasons for why gays are discriminated against. Multiple polls CLEARLY demonstrate the fact that those with anti-gay biases are more likely to be Christian than not.\n And yet you pretend that GAYS are the ones who have created the religious fervor?\n You're unbelievable! (And not in a good way...)\n religion opposes lots of things, like calling christmas x-mas, and giving out condoms in schools. the law opposes many things, like public nudity and smoking weed. there are hundreds of groups out there that have there pick of things they could feel oppressed about. if i want to claim something is oppressing me, its not hard to find\n \n \n \ngays and gay supporters are the main group that is making this percieved oppression (oppression that really doesnt exist, or can easily be fixed by simply focusing on the laws themselves and organizing a proper proposal) into such a spectacle. the mere fact that you guys allow the opinion of the religious right control you in such an impactful way says a lot about what you really are trying to accomplished. if you wanted the laws to change, then the opinions of the church is irrelevant \n\n If the \"opinion of the church\" were truly irrelevant in affairs of the government, this would NOT be an issue at all.\n Remember a little while back where there was a HUGE stink about how the Catholic church had areas where they were talking about withholding sacrament from members who voted in a way that the church didn't condone?\n When we talk about \"religion\", we're talking about that the INDIVIDUALS, who are pushed by their religion, to be against homosexuality...\n And we're also pointing out that if the ONLY REASON WHY those individuals are against homsoexuality is based on \"religion\", then it is an insufficient rationale for being against gay rights...\n \n I would really love to hear an explanation as to how gays supposedly give \"religion power\". It just makes no sense. Please be explicit in showing how the actions of gay people somehow give religion the power to limit the lives of gay people.\n \n \nlike i said, the size of the spectacle gives you a distorted view about the size of the issue. this is identical to what happened with saddam. saddam is not the most evil, saddistic or genocidal dictator in the world. but everybody believes he is, because the media made such a spectacle out of the things he did, and no mention of the other dictators who are even more murderous and tyranical. this is exactly whats happening here. of course the majority of the public will believe that gays are the worlds greatest victims, and only because gays put the spotlight on themselves\n\n You're hyperbolizing again. We're not claiming that we're the \"greatest victims\"...\n But despite your denial, we HAVE BEEN victims, and in some ways, we CONTINUE TO BE victims.\n Military discrimination. Adoption discrimination. Marriage discrimination.\n \n \ndude, interracial relations were just as opposed at one time. people label all kind of people mentally ill. this is an opinion. \n\n It's patently hilarious how you go from trying to claim that homosexuals aren't victims, to then pointing out how OTHER PEOPLE, like blacks, have been victims as well.\n Do you get whiplash when you do that?\n And I'm not talking about just \"people\" labelling gays as mentally ill. I'm talking about the PSYCHIATRIC EXPERTS labelling gays as mentally ill based on NO real reason whatsoever.\n \n \n \nthe law prohibits any unmarried couples from adopting children, not just gays, in most states. so you cant make it a case of gays being victimized\n\n Can you prove how laws \"in most states\" prohibit unmarried couples from adopting children?\n I really wish you would quit talking out your arse and pretending you have knowledge you clearly don't have...\n It's border-line lying...\n \n \ndont people have a right to be nude?\n\n Show me any court case which states that people have that right. Any governmental document.\n Can't do it? Then quit making **it up!\n Marriage IS a governmentally recognized right. Review Loving v Virginia if you need proof.\n \n \nwhat scientific study has provided evidence that being gay is genetic? there are lots of studies that demonstrate that being gay MAY BE genetic, and i have no argument with that. after all, i have provided evidence that santa claus MAY exist, that is yet to be disputed.\n\n I am coming more and more to the conclusion that you're just a bald-faced liar...\n There is no scientific study which shows that there is a Santa Claus.\n There are scientific studies which show that homosexuality has a genetic component.\n \n \ndo you have any clue about any of that? i can guarantee you that miscegenation wasnt overturned because interacial couples went around parading and waving flags and making out in public. they address the laws directly. learn from history\n\n 1) Parading: Martin Luther King Jr anyone? Do I need to continue a list?\n 2) \"making out in public\": I'm a gay man who has a variety of gay friends that I hang out with. Beyond a gay bar, I have NEVER seen any gay couple make out in public. You're demonstrating your fears rather than a real complaint.\n 3) What makes you think we aren't addressing the laws directly. Do you need me to point you to the legal cases challenging gay adoption laws? Gay exclusion from the military? Gay marriage laws?\n Your analogy is stupid. The blacks also had marching in the street for their rights. These battles are waged on multiple fronts, and the black civil rights movement never decided to forego the public march so they could solely go for court battles. They did both.\n Just like the gay rights movement is doing...\n Each has their own separate purpose...",

If it's not actually \"recognized\" as a right (as you put it), then it's apples and oranges..\n 2) As a right, the 14th amendment applies protecting the rights of the citizens.\n 3) This protection is not absolute. Discrimination can still occur against people's rights as long as the government has a \"legitimate state interest\" for doing so. (A \"constitutional\" legal term...)\n 4) Preventing gay marriage has no legitimate state interest.\n 4a) Morality cannot be used as a legitimate state interest. I've proven that via court statements.\n 4b) Historicity makes an incredibly crappy attempted legitimate state interest. Just think. Segregation can continue to occur because it's been around that way long enough.\n 4c) So the challenge is open for people to actually give what they think is a legitimate state interest... Because if one doesn't exist, it's a constitutional mandate that the government must recognize gay marriage.",

   "You're obfuscating again, which is what I've come to expect from you.\n The issue isn't behavior which is \"legal\". The issue, in context of the situation I was discussing, was whether or not something was a right.\n \n I'm talking about whether nudity is a RIGHT, like marriage is a right.\n\n \n If it's not expressly prohibited by law, it's a right. You can do it. Public nudity IS expressly prohibited by law, in most places. I can't help it if you're using a bad analogy.\n \n \nA right doesn't have to be recognized to be a right?\n\n \n That's correct. We live in a free country, and we can do what we want unless it contradicts the law which tells us what we CAN'T do, not what we CAN.\n \n \nSounds like a great losing court argument...\n Can you imagine it?\n \"Well, your honor, you don't have to recognize that nudity is a right in order to rule that nudity is a right...\"\n\n \n I think you are getting confused.\n \n \n1) The federal government has EXPLICITLY acknowledged that marriage is a right.

As a gay man you can marry a woman anytime you want.\n \n \n4c) So the challenge is open for people to actually give what they think is a legitimate state interest... Because if one doesn't exist, it's a constitutional mandate that the government must recognize gay marriage.\n\n \n The problem with your thinking is that your understanding of marriage and the law is incorrect here. There is marriage, and then there is the govt.'s recognition of marriage. What you are really fighting for isn't marriage, but the govt. to give benefits for your marriages. You already have the right to get married anytime you want, to another gay person. No police are going to block the door to the chapel. You can do that anytime you want. What isn't going to happen however, is the govt. viewing your union as a marriage, because marriage is understood in our culture as being an opposite-sex institution. The challenge is for you to convince society to change that. That's the only way it's going to ultimately come about.",

   "If it's not expressly prohibited by law, it's a right. You can do it. Public nudity IS expressly prohibited by law, in most places. I can't help it if you're using a bad analogy.\n\n Jyoshu, wake up. Review the context of the statements. Review the history of the thread.\n I am NOT the one who brought up public nudity as an analogy. Re-read that sentence if you need to.\n I also think it's a crappy analogy. I was destroying it before you jumped in, took my statements out of context, and totally mucked up what was ACTUALLY being said.\n \n And your pseudo-definition of \"right\" above is ridiculous. It may be your PERSONAL definition of what is a \"right\", but it isn't the definition of what the GOVERNMENT uses. And THAT is the definition I am going to use. A LEGAL definition in a LEGAL context for LEGAL arguments.\n Don't try to side-track me by insisting I use your definition, because it just ain't gonna happen.\n \n Next time, UNDERSTAND what is going on before you jump in and reveal you're clueless...\n \n \n \nThat's correct. We live in a free country, and we can do what we want unless it contradicts the law which tells us what we CAN'T do, not what we CAN.\n\n Do you even know what I'm referring to when I talk about a \"right\" in the first place?\n \n civil rights\n n. those rights guaranteed by the Bill of Rights, the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution, including the right to due process, equal treatment under the law of all people regarding enjoyment of life, liberty, property, and protection. Positive civil rights include the right to vote, the opportunity to enjoy the benefits of a democratic society, such as equal access to public schools, recreation, transportation, public facilities, and housing, and equal and fair treatment by law enforcement and the courts.\n http://dictionary.law.com/default2.asp?selected=204&bold=||||\n \n Again, you're jumping into the middle of a conversation oblivious to what I'm actually talking about.\n If you're making up your own personal definition of \"right\", then so be it. You're free to do so, but I'm not interested.\n I'm talking about rights PROTECTED by the constitution. And if we legalized public nudity tomorrow on a whim, it would not make it a \"right\" which is \"protected\" by the constitution.\n If you're trying to supply a legal definition of the term to actually refute something I'm saying, then give some sort of legal context, because your statements are just nonsensical.\n \n Not even Merriam-Webster dictionary has such a ridiculously liberal interpretation of the word:\n right:\n 2 : something to which one has a just claim: as a : the power or privilege to which one is justly entitled b (1) : the interest that one has in a piece of property -- often used in plural <mineral rights< (2) plural : the property interest possessed under law or custom and agreement in an intangible thing especially of a literary and artistic nature <film rights of the novel<\n 3 : something that one may properly claim as due\n \n \n \nI think you are getting confused.\n\n No. I think it is you who is hopelessly confused.\n I am talking about \"rights\" in a specific context. The legal arena.\n You are interjecting your personal definition of the term, and pretending that it's a debate...\n \n I don't know where you are coming up with this \"A right doesn't have to be recognized to be a right.\" XXXX. If you can give me a source beyond your own opinion, that would be helpful.\n If the government doesn't recognize something as a right, then how the heck can anybody consider it as a real \"right\" in a legal sense?\n \n \n \nMarriage in the opposite-sex sense, yes. And you have that right already. As a gay man you can marry a woman anytime you want.\n\n Loving v Virginia established that being ABLE to marry is not the only right at hand. After all, couldn't ALL races marry under miscegenation laws?\n WHO a person can marry is also a right governed by the 14th amendment. The RESTRICTIONS on marriage also need to be justified according to the 14th amendment.\n \n After all, didn't blacks and whites all have an \"equal right\" to marry somebody of the same race under miscegenation laws?\n \n Your reply is nothing better than a circular argument, trying to both define away opposition and justify its definition in the definition.\n Saying we can marry somebody of the opposite sex IS NOT enough.\n According to the 14th amendment, you have to justify WHY that restriction is in place in the first place....\n \n You can't just say \"Rosa Parks has a right to ride the bus, but it's a right to ride at the back of the bus...\"\n \n \n \nThe problem with your thinking is that your understanding of marriage and the law is incorrect here. There is marriage, and then there is the govt.'s recognition of marriage. What you are really fighting for isn't marriage, but the govt. to give benefits for your marriages. You already have the right to get married anytime you want, to another gay person. No police are going to block the door to the chapel. You can do that anytime you want. What isn't going to happen however, is the govt. viewing your union as a marriage, because marriage is understood in our culture as being an opposite-sex institution.\n\n You were doing fine until that last sentence, although I don't think you really realized that I already was on that page years ago...\n Don't bore me with semantics. I'm arguing for governmental recognition. When I say that the government doesn't \"allow\" gay marriage, or similar statements, I'm talking about allowing marriages to occur at the court-house or similar governmental recognition with a legal document. Don't split meaningless hairs. It doesn't change any of my arguments...\n Just because the government \"allows\" gay marriage to occur without governmental recognition does not mean that the constitutional requirements are satisfied. There is a list of over 1,000 rights associated with marriage. Rights which the government protects when people get married. Inheritance rights. Divorce protection rights. Visitation rights. etc...\n \n And more to the point, society and our \"culture\" doesn't NEED to view marriage as more than just an \"opposite-sex institution\" in order for the government to recognize gay marriages.\n \n Society and governmental recognition are two entirely separate things, and the government recognizes equal rights even when the majority doesn't.\n \n \n \nThe challenge is for you to convince society to change that. That's the only way it's going to ultimately come about.\n\n I again refer you to Loving v Virginia.\n I think I have proven, on some of these threads, that when miscegenation laws were overturned society WAS NOT convinced that they needed to change the laws on interracial marriage. In fact, a LARGER percentage was opposed to interracial marriage in 1968 (70%) than exists today opposing same sex marriage.\n \n So you see, the government DOES NOT need to wait for society to approve of gay marriage before it recognizes gay marriage. Our court system doesn't take an opinion poll, and rule off of the opinion of the majority. They rule on the CONSTITUTION and the LAW.\n \n You don't seem to grasp that while it would be nice if society was all supportive of equal rights, they don't need to be for the government to recognize equal rights.",

   "Do you actually need an education in the fact that laws CAN BE discriminatory?\n Here's a pop quiz for you. There used to be laws against interracial marriage.\n Using your logic, were they discriminatory?\n\n and there are laws against drug use, tax evasion, undocumented employment, child pornography and stealing. using your logic, are these discriminatory?\n \n \nWould you like to start a legal discussion on why laws preventing gay marriage are unconstitutional?\n I'm ready...\n\n sure. what in the constitution is violated by not legally recognizing a marriage that is not between an adult man and woman?\n \n \nCan you show me examples of things they blamed on \"wiccans\" and similar nonsense, where gays weren't included?\n\n ummm.. didnt you read what i just wrote? are mardi gras revelers a gay group? are hindus in indonesia a gay group?\n \n \nWhat \"power\" do they have over our daily lives????\n And HOW did we supposedly give them that \"power\"????\n If you think that gay rights issues have gotten worse because gays started fighting for equality, then you're delusional!\n I welcome you to substantiate that position, if you hold it...\n\n dont you (as well as the gay community in general) realize that you are harping on this gay vs church issue on matters that dont even belong there?\n 1. \"homosexuality is a sin\" is based on a book written by deluded people thousands of years ago. the fact that christians take this book seriously shouldnt mean that gays should as well\n 2. gay marriage is a legal issue. and, like any legal issue, any members of the public have a right to support or oppose the matter depending on their beliefs. this is a democratic system\n based on what i wrote above, targetting christianity is a diversion that is causing gays to waste their time and resources on efforts that will get them no closer to acheiving their goals. you cant intimidate people out of opposing a proposed legal amendment. you present your case more strongly than the defending party. as for grappling over whether homosexuality is a sin, its a sin, and that should settle it. your duty is to not care about what a book says about your lifestyle, or what a group of people believs about your lifestyle based on said book.\n \n \nChicken or the egg time, and you're missing the HUGE chicken standing in the room which has been sitting there for CENTURIES...\n Gays were discriminated against LONG BEFORE gays started fighting back against the discrimination.\n To pretend that our fighting against the discrimination is creating the attention is obtuse!\n\n the discrimination you are talking about mostly, from what ive seen, is nothing more than gays taking something somebody said, very often completely out of context, and turning it into a \"you offended me, boo hoo your homophobic\" type of issue. review the american idol example\n \n \nWow. You are just really trying to be the cart pushing the horse, aren't you...\n RELIGION is at the forefront of the reasons for why gays are discriminated against. Multiple polls CLEARLY demonstrate the fact that those with anti-gay biases are more likely to be Christian than not.\n And yet you pretend that GAYS are the ones who have created the religious fervor?\n You're unbelievable! (And not in a good way...)\n \n If the \"opinion of the church\" were truly irrelevant in affairs of the government, this would NOT be an issue at all.\n Remember a little while back where there was a HUGE stink about how the Catholic church had areas where they were talking about withholding sacrament from members who voted in a way that the church didn't condone?\n When we talk about \"religion\", we're talking about that the INDIVIDUALS, who are pushed by their religion, to be against homosexuality...\n And we're also pointing out that if the ONLY REASON WHY those individuals are against homsoexuality is based on \"religion\", then it is an insufficient rationale for being against gay rights... \n \n I would really love to hear an explanation as to how gays supposedly give \"religion power\". It just makes no sense. Please be explicit in showing how the actions of gay people somehow give religion the power to limit the lives of gay people.\n\n oh, so youre upset because you didnt get any sacrament? well boo hoo. this is exactly what im talking about<b></b>: letting your lives be centered around religious opinion. what is up with this pathetic begging for religious acceptance? i cant figure this out for the life of me\n \n \nYou're hyperbolizing again. We're not claiming that we're the \"greatest victims\"...\n But despite your denial, we HAVE BEEN victims, and in some ways, we CONTINUE TO BE victims.\n Military discrimination. Adoption discrimination. Marriage discrimination.\n\n i never denied that gays were victims, i said that gays take everyday out-of-context situations and turn them into victimization cases so more people will think that gays are the most victimized group on the planet. and it works.\n \n adoption and marrige laws are no more discriminatory than laws against weed smokers and nudists. as for military and employment and things like that, yes those were discriminatory, and they have been since been recognized as such and removed\n \n \nIt's patently hilarious how you go from trying to claim that homosexuals aren't victims, to then pointing out how OTHER PEOPLE, like blacks, have been victims as well.\n Do you get whiplash when you do that?\n And I'm not talking about just \"people\" labelling gays as mentally ill. I'm talking about the PSYCHIATRIC EXPERTS labelling gays as mentally ill based on NO real reason whatsoever.\n\n well, it should tell you a bit about the people the scientific community calls psychiatric experts huh? these \"scientists\" very often have agendas that make them come up with conclusions like that based on half-baked \"studies\" that really have no real scientific methodoly or structure. one day youll understand this, i hope\n \n \nCan you prove how laws \"in most states\" prohibit unmarried couples from adopting children?\n I really wish you would quit talking out your arse and pretending you have knowledge you clearly don't have...\n It's border-line lying...\n\n ok, i might be wrong about \"most states\", but according to here about half the states do not permit joint adoption by an unmarried couple. in many of these states where the law doesnt generally allow it, it can still be allowed on a case by case basis. in most cases a single person can adopt a child, but if that person has an unmarried artner, that partner is not allowed to become a second adopting parent in about half of the states\n \n \nShow me any court case which states that people have that right. Any governmental document.\n Can't do it? Then quit making **it up!\n Marriage IS a governmentally recognized right. Review Loving v Virginia if you need proof.\n\n show me a document that states that there are no restrictions whatsoever as to what types of parties constitute a marriage.\n \n \nI am coming more and more to the conclusion that you're just a bald-faced liar...\n There is no scientific study which shows that there is a Santa Claus.\n There are scientific studies which show that homosexuality has a genetic component.\n\n try reading with your eyes open next time. i said there is scientific evidence that there MAY BE a santa claus. there is also scientific evidence that homosexuality MAY BE genetic or part genetic\n \n \n1) Parading: Martin Luther King Jr anyone? Do I need to continue a list?\n 2) \"making out in public\": I'm a gay man who has a variety of gay friends that I hang out with. Beyond a gay bar, I have NEVER seen any gay couple make out in public. You're demonstrating your fears rather than a real complaint.\n 3) What makes you think we aren't addressing the laws directly. Do you need me to point you to the legal cases challenging gay adoption laws? Gay exclusion from the military? Gay marriage laws?\n Your analogy is stupid. The blacks also had marching in the street for their rights. These battles are waged on multiple fronts, and the black civil rights movement never decided to forego the public march so they could solely go for court battles. They did both.\n Just like the gay rights movement is doing...\n Each has their own separate purpose...\n\n yes, im aware of the legal work that attorneys are doing for gay rights. but its glaringly obvious that on the grassroots level the majority of the gay comunity is doing nothing more than attacking the religious position. \n \n demonstrations for rights and public support by marching and rallying makes a difference. demanding that christians stop preaching the way they do does not.",

   "and there are laws against drug use, tax evasion, undocumented \n employment, child pornography and stealing. using your logic, are these discriminatory?\n\n Actually yes.\n But you see, the constitution doesn't prevent ANY form of discrimination from occurring. It prevents UNJUST forms of discrimination from occurring, to differing degrees. If an issue involves a governmentally recognized right, then the level of scrutiny of that \"rationale\" behind the discrimination is higher.\n The laws you mentioned have obvious justification, which I can spell out for you if necessary. \n \n \n \nsure. what in the constitution is violated by not legally recognizing a marriage that is not between an adult man and woman?\n\n The 14th amendment.\n In Loving v Virginia, it was firmly established that the CAPACITY to marry was not the ONLY right present in marriage rights, but WHO a person marries is also a right.\n As such, the 14th amendment demands that any restrictions placed upon that right be justified.\n Are you with me so far?\n \n \n \nummm.. didnt you read what i just wrote? are mardi gras revelers a gay group? are hindus in indonesia a gay group?\n\n You're missing the point of contention.\n I will admit that Christian groups show some focus on other \"sinner\" groups as they show focus on gays. The point of disagreement is your contention that the intensity of the spotlight is equal across the spectrum. It's not. There is a SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER religious/political focus on gays than on the other groups.\n \n \n \ndont you (as well as the gay community in general) realize that you are harping on this gay vs church issue on matters that dont even belong there?\n\n Again, I think you are completely missing the point as to what is the CAUSE and what is the EFFECT here...\n Christian organizations are attempting to limit the rights of gays. They are doing so for religious reasons.\n Gays point out that the first amendment prohibits a religious basis for law. They also point out that the religious arguments against homosexuality have flaws.\n \n Our arguments are a RESPONSE. Not an initiator...\n \n And I fail to see why we shouldn't give that response. I fail to see how giving that response gives the Christians \"power\" over our lives. We are utilizing our first amendment right to speak out against those who would oppress us. I see that as having power.\n Being quiet and allowing Christians in their oppositions to gays to go unchallenged would be a move that gives power to the Christian anti-gay movement...\n \n And on a separate note, do you realize that it is YOU, and not me, that keeps bringing up religion as an issue?\n My argument is more with your claim that gays *empower* Christians, which I disagree with. I have not been trying to persuade people that the Bible supports homosexuality. I have typically ignored biblical arguments.\n Do you realize that?\n \n \n \n1. \"homosexuality is a sin\" is based on a book written by deluded people thousands of years ago. the fact that christians take this book seriously shouldnt mean that gays should as well 2. gay marriage is a legal issue. and, like any legal issue, any members of the public have a right to support or oppose the matter depending on their beliefs.\n\n 1) I don't take the book seriously. In fact, I typically debate these issues on a purely legal issue. I occasionally comment on people trying to exclaim that their religious beliefs are just so unbelievably obvious that they should be treated as fact, but typically if some religious argument is made for a position, I ignore it. I could care less if they believed gays are wrong. Just as long as they understand why that religious belief cannot be made into a law.\n 2) I'm sorry, but I don't think anybody here is demanding that the Christians not have a right to support or oppose matters based on their beliefs.\n What we ARE doing is saying that despite that religious support, it CANNOT be made into law because it's RELIGION.\n What we ARE doing is \"opposing the matter\" based on our beliefs, which we have a right to do.\n \n \n \nbased on what i wrote above, targetting christianity is a diversion that is causing gays to waste their time and resources on efforts that will get them no closer to acheiving their goals.\n\n If you have a gay rights legal aid group that is going to churches and protesting them, I would agree. They should concentrate in the legal arena.\n Do you see any gay legal groups acting as such?\n \n If you are talking about gays in general, who speak out when Christians speak out, then your complaint is pointless. It is just as \"wasteful\" of the time and resources for the Christian who initiated the conversation in the first place, isn't it?\n \n \n \nyou cant intimidate people out of opposing a proposed legal amendment.\n\n You frequently use terms that I just don't understand why you used it.\n Like your claim of \"intimidation\". What \"intimidation\" do you speak of?\n Please. Give an example.\n \n \n \nyou present your case more strongly than the defending party. as for grappling over whether homosexuality is a sin, its a sin, and that should settle it.\n\n Opinions on sin are irrelevant as a justification for law.\n Anything but heterosexual vaginal intercourse used to be considered as a \"sin\". In fact, of the 13 states that had laws preventing sodomy before they were overruled, 9 of them had laws against heterosexual sodomy. In EIGHT of those states, a wife couldn't give her husband a blow-job because it was illegal.\n Do you think that pointing out that classifications of \"sin\" are irrelevant to justifications for law is a means of empowering Christians to have power over my life?\n \n \n \nthe discrimination you are talking about mostly, from what ive seen, is nothing more than gays taking something somebody said, very often completely out of context, and turning it into a \"you offended me, boo hoo your homophobic\" type of issue. review the american idol example\n\n Stop right there sunshine.\n Don't lump me in with anything else. I have never brought up \"American Idol\".\n When I talk of discrimination, I am quite explicit, and I give concrete examples.\n 1) Gays are excluded from military service.\n 2) Gays (and gay couples) are excluded from adopting.\n 3) Gay marriages are not recognized by the government.\n \n Past examples include:\n 4) Sodomy laws.\n 5) Colorado's Amendment #2\n 6) The Psychiatric community's listing of homosexuality as a \"mental illness\".\n \n Another example of discrimination is the Boy Scouts issue, but I actually support the right of the Boy Scouts to exclude gays, as the Boy Scouts are a PRIVATE group. They could exclude people who have an \"E\" in their name if they wanted. That's the type of America I love and live in!\n \n I don't bring up namby-pamby XXXX like \"American Idol\". It's just not even on my radar, and I have no idea what you're even talking about. Go complain about that focus to somebody who is actually talking about it...\n \n In the big scheme of things, I don't think most of the REAL gay rights movement is really caught up in what you're complaining that we're caught up in. Individual gay people might be, and they might be many in numbers, but as far as actual political and legal efforts, they aren't in that category.\n \n \n \noh, so youre upset because you didnt get any sacrament? well boo hoo.\n\n Do me a favor.\n Actually READ what I'm saying. UNDERSTAND the context of my statements.\n \n I am not upset that I didn't get any sacrament. Your reply is an example of how you fail to accurately recognize reality. I'm not Christian.\n \n The point is in pointing out the RELIGIOUS INVOLVEMENT in the political issues.\n And back to a previously attempted point of yours, do you know which two issues the Catholic church were going to withhold sacrament over?\n (Give you a hint: Wiccans and Hindus WEREN'T involved...)\n \n \n \noh, so youre upset because you didnt get any sacrament? well boo hoo. this is exactly what im talking about...\n\n Yes. This IS exactly what you're talking about...\n This is a perfect example.\n \n You have taken something and COMPLETELY misinterpreted it.\n I'm not upset over not getting sacrament.\n You have completely failed to accurately interpret what I was saying, and you have completely failed to understand the situation.\n \n I feel that is indicative of a lot of your perceptions on the gay rights movement as a whole...\n \n \n \ni never denied that gays were victims, i said that gays take everyday out-of-context situations and turn them into victimization cases so more people will think that gays are the most victimized group on the planet. and it works.\n\n Yeah. But did you know that EVERY GROUP has examples of that?\n There was a Christian \"convention\" recently where a bunch of Christians got together and discussed how they were the next big minority group in America, and how there was a \"War\" on Christianity.\n \n I hate it when gays turn a non-existent mole-hill into a mountain. I hate it when other groups do that too. Cynthia McKinney would be another excellent example.\n \n But, and I don't know how many times I'll have to say this, I AM NOT INCLUDING those types of issues as a part of the gay rights movement. If I see somebody trying to include them, I'll address them when I see them.\n Can you point me to anybody on this message board (and a post for an example) where they improperly claimed \"victimization\"? \n If so, and I agree with your assessment, I'll be happy to comment on it.\n \n But until then, you are complaining about something you haven't really shown...\n And you'll have to note that you are complaining about something that I AM NOT DOING.\n \n \n \nadoption and marrige laws are no more discriminatory than laws \n against weed smokers and nudists.\n\n Yeah. And laws against blacks riding in the front of the bus are no more discriminatory than laws against weed smokers and nudists... <end sarcasm<\n The point is the JUSTIFICATION for those laws. Laws against nudity aren't discriminatory against nudists, but rather the ACT of nudity which isn't a right.\n Laws discriminating against homosexuals typically have only one real rationale behind their existence. A bunch of people morally disapprove of gay people. And that isn't a good enough reason...\n \"Our prior cases make two propositions abundantly clear. First, the fact that the governing majority in a State has traditionally viewed a particular practice as immoral is not a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting the practice; neither history nor tradition could save a law prohibiting miscegenation from constitutional attack.\"\n Lawrence v Texas\n (Note, quite clearly, NOT a religious argument...)\n \n \n \nas for military and employment and things like that, yes those were discriminatory, and they have been since been recognized as such and removed\n\n Wrong!\n The military still has a ban against gays in the military. All Clinton did was tell the military not to focus so much on the gay issue, but the law STILL STANDS preventing gays in the military.\n Anybody who serves in the military and is found out to be gay can be tossed out. Period. It's just that simple.\n As for \"employment\", wrong again. Here's a map.\n http://www.lambdalegal.org/cgi-bin/iowa/states/antidiscrimi-map\n The vast majority of states have no laws against an employer firing a man JUST because he's gay.\n \n \n \nwell, it should tell you a bit about the people the scientific community calls psychiatric experts huh?\n\n I really wish you would quit spouting off and start THINKING and LEARNING about the situation first.\n There has NEVER been any scientific research or reason for classifying homosexuality as a mental illness. The only reason they did so was the same reason that everybody else discriminated against gays. Prejudice.\n Just like everybody else.\n \n The Psychiatric community in America was one of the VERY FIRST examples of people questioning the prejudice against homosexuality, which goes to their CREDIT. Not a negative thing...\n \n They were human and made a mistake. They were human and thought like their fellow humans for a while.\n But then they were one of the first to evolve from that limited intellectual state, and conclude something it took the rest of the population longer to realize.\n \n \n \nthese \"scientists\" very often have agendas that make them come up with conclusions like that based on half-baked \"studies\" that really have no real scientific methodoly or structure. one day youll understand this, i hope\n\n Dude. I am \"understanding\" a LOT about you in this discussion.\n You are showing me absolutely nothing as far as proof.\n How about you actually SHOW ME an example of what you're talking about...\n I can show you PLENTY of religious right people funding and endorsing people who lie and behave as you describe in order to denigrate the homosexual community.\n \n What you describe IS NOT indicative of the community as a whole, but rather a symptom of the more unscrupulous and more prejudiced members. The RELIGIOUS RIGHT trying to get involved in the act is the real problem.\n \n \n \nok, i might be wrong about \"most states\", but according to here about half the states do not permit joint adoption by an unmarried couple. in many of these states where the law doesnt generally allow it, it can still be allowed on a case by case basis. in most cases a single person can adopt a child, but if that person has an unmarried artner, that partner is not allowed to become a second adopting parent in about half of the states\n\n Okay now. Complete that line of thinking...\n \n If a straight couple is prohibited from adopting because they aren't married, CAN THEY get married and adopt?\n If a gay couple is prohibited from adopting because they aren't married, CAN THEY get married and adopt?\n \n If gay couples could get married, your response would have merit.\n Until then, it's only half of the story, and missing the best part...\n It's IMPOSSIBLE for a gay couple to adopt in the discussed states, but ALWAYS possible for a unmarried couple to adopt in those states (if 'marriage' is their only restrictor)\n \n \n \nshow me a document that states that there are no restrictions whatsoever as to what types of parties constitute a marriage.\n\n 1) Show me where I claimed such a document exists...\n 2) I'm not claiming \"there are no restrictions whatsoever as to what types of parties constitute a marriage\". I AM claiming that when restrictions are placed upon marriage, those restrictions need to satisfy 14th amendment tests. If they don't, they are unconstitutional.\n 3) With all that in mind, can you show me what justification exists for preventing gay marriage which satisfies the 14th amendment?\n \n \n \ntry reading with your eyes open next time. i said there is scientific evidence that there MAY BE a santa claus. there is also scientific evidence that homosexuality MAY BE genetic or part genetic\n\n Your claim, in and of itself, demonstrates a gross misunderstanding of what \"scientific evidence\" and \"research\" is in the first place, what they can intelligently conclude, and what the research on gay genes has ACTUALLY shown. It rests on denigrating what quality scientific research is, and alleges that the \"gay gene\" research is not quality WITHOUT actually showing anything.\n The research on gay genes hasn't just shown a \"MAY BE\" genetic link.\n They have PROVEN a genetic link.\n \n \n \nyes, im aware of the legal work that attorneys are doing for gay rights. but its glaringly obvious that on the grassroots level the majority of the gay comunity is doing nothing more than attacking the religious position. \n\n The amount of the Christian religious right attacking the gay community is MUCH GREATER than the \"grassroots level\" of the gay community attacking the Christians.\n I realize you don't believe that, and the only recourse for the evolution of that discussion would seem to be for you to show HOW the \"grassroots level\" of the \"majority of the gay community\" is attacking \"the religious position\".",

   "demonstrations for rights and public support by marching and rallying makes a difference. demanding that christians stop preaching the way they do does not.\n\n Seriously.\n I see a LOT MORE of the \"marching and rallying\" for rights and public support than I do of ANY demand that Christians \"stop preaching the way they do\".\n \n I could show you effort after effort that gays are undertaking in trying to get equal rights. Efforts to get the \"employment\" laws enacted, which you blithely assumed were already there. Efforts to get the military law changed. Efforts on MULTIPLE fronts.\n \n What we could do is just start comparing notes, and see which side gets exhausted first.

   "Actually yes.\n But you see, the constitution doesn't prevent ANY form of discrimination from occurring. It prevents UNJUST forms of discrimination from occurring, to differing degrees. If an issue involves a governmentally recognized right, then the level of scrutiny of that \"rationale\" behind the discrimination is higher.\n The laws you mentioned have obvious justification, which I can spell out for you if necessary. \n\n and you qualify \"unjust\" by what measurement? \"justness\" is a social opinion. if society generally agrees that something is ok, then its ok. like i said, i have a million and one things in the system i can point out are unjust and discriminatory to me. and since you just told me that all laws that prevent me from doing whatever i want to do are discriminatory, then why should discrimination against one group be more special than discrimination against another group\n \n i mentioned banning of public prayer in schools. this is clearly a law that discriminates against christian students and teachers. would you support a cause to prevent christians from being discriminated against by the law?\n \n \nThe 14th amendment.\n In Loving v Virginia, it was firmly established that the CAPACITY to marry was not the ONLY right present in marriage rights, but WHO a person marries is also a right.\n As such, the 14th amendment demands that any restrictions placed upon that right be justified.\n Are you with me so far?\n\n the 14th amendment \"Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\"\n \n the privelleges of adults concerning marriage entails a man and woman legally joining. like people has pointed out before, the 14th amendment makes sure that nobody is denied these rights. there is no right that says men can marry men, so as such it is not a denial of a right nor a violation of this amendment\n \n \nYou're missing the point of contention.\n I will admit that Christian groups show some focus on other \"sinner\" groups as they show focus on gays. The point of disagreement is your contention that the intensity of the spotlight is equal across the spectrum. It's not. There is a SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER religious/political focus on gays than on the other groups.\n\n and like i said, that focus is magnified by the gays themselves. right on this forum there are a few gay posters that have the same habit of hyperbolizing unrelated and irrelevant issues and making it seem as though its another case of gay bashing and oppression, when usually it is nothing of the sort. the thing is, if somebody says \"i was offended\", theres really no argument one can make, so this makes it look even more that the act was indeed offensive whereas it was nothing more than another gay crying wolf\n \n \nAgain, I think you are completely missing the point as to what is the CAUSE and what is the EFFECT here...\n Christian organizations are attempting to limit the rights of gays. They are doing so for religious reasons.\n Gays point out that the first amendment prohibits a religious basis for law. They also point out that the religious arguments against homosexuality have flaws.\n\n anybody can affect and attempt to influence the laws based on their pesonal beliefs, regardless of where those beliefs come from. christians have the personal belief that a marriage should consist of 2 adult different gendered parents. regardless of whether this is based on a religious teaching or not, it is a belief that christians have the right to express and they have the right to influence the creation or amendment of laws that reinforce or oppose their personal beliefs, just like everybody else in the country\n \nOur arguments are a RESPONSE. Not an initiator...\n\n a response to a non-existent cause is an initiator. i'm not saying that every case of gays making a remark is uncalled for or a false alarm, but a significant amount are.\n \n \nAnd I fail to see why we shouldn't give that response. I fail to see how giving that response gives the Christians \"power\" over our lives. We are utilizing our first amendment right to speak out against those who would oppress us. I see that as having power.\n Being quiet and allowing Christians in their oppositions to gays to go unchallenged would be a move that gives power to the Christian anti-gay movement...\n\n there you go again. nobody is oppressing you. its what i just said above. you do understand how a democratic system works, right?\n \n \nAnd on a separate note, do you realize that it is YOU, and not me, that keeps bringing up religion as an issue?\n My argument is more with your claim that gays *empower* Christians, which I disagree with. I have not been trying to persuade people that the Bible supports homosexuality. I have typically ignored biblical arguments.\n Do you realize that?\n \n \n 1) I don't take the book seriously. In fact, I typically debate these issues on a purely legal issue. I occasionally comment on people trying to exclaim that their religious beliefs are just so unbelievably obvious that they should be treated as fact, but typically if some religious argument is made for a position, I ignore it. I could care less if they believed gays are wrong. Just as long as they understand why that religious belief cannot be made into a law.\n 2) I'm sorry, but I don't think anybody here is demanding that the Christians not have a right to support or oppose matters based on their beliefs.\n What we ARE doing is saying that despite that religious support, it CANNOT be made into law because it's RELIGION.\n What we ARE doing is \"opposing the matter\" based on our beliefs, which we have a right to do.\n\n 1. well if you typically ignore religious opinions, good. ill bear that in mind\n \n 2. a law can be influenced based on a PERSONAL belief by a soceity or groupd within the society, regardless of if it is inspired by religion or not. the separation of church and state requires that you cannot legally endorse or restrict the influence of religion on society. many gay supporters and secularists wrongly believe that the separation of church and state is a license to eliminate religious opinion from the system, but this is false. a group of persons with ANY opinion, regardless of its motivation, can lobby to the legal institutions and have their case heard, just like anybody else with any personal opinion motivated by any other reason\n \n \nIf you have a gay rights legal aid group that is going to churches and protesting them, I would agree. They should concentrate in the legal arena.\n Do you see any gay legal groups acting as such?\n\n did i say that i did? compare the number of anti-church gay activists to the number of legal aid gay activists, if you will\n \n \nIf you are talking about gays in general, who speak out when Christians speak out, then your complaint is pointless. It is just as \"wasteful\" of the time and resources for the Christian who initiated the conversation in the first place, isn't it?\n\n its not a case of \"he started it, so hmmph\". gays and christians have been at odds for thousands of years. its only lately that support for gays has surpassed critical mass and the confrontations are more open. so its not a matter of christians initiated anything. i have no idea where you got that idea or how you suppose you can back it up\n \n \nYou frequently use terms that I just don't understand why you used it.\n Like your claim of \"intimidation\". What \"intimidation\" do you speak of?\n Please. Give an example.\n\n here's an example of from a poster on this forum recently:\n \"What we ARE doing is saying that despite that religious support, it CANNOT be made into law because it's RELIGION.\n What we ARE doing is \"opposing the matter\" based on our beliefs, which we have a right to do.\"\n \n gays \"have a right\" to oppose a matter \"based on their beliefs\", while christians \"CANNOT\" influence a law based on their beliefs. apparently, what gays believe outrank what a christian believes in the legal system. it sounds kinda like bullying to me\n \n \nOpinions on sin are irrelevant as a justification for law.\n Anything but heterosexual vaginal intercourse used to be considered as a \"sin\". In fact, of the 13 states that had laws preventing sodomy before they were overruled, 9 of them had laws against heterosexual sodomy. In EIGHT of those states, a wife couldn't give her husband a blow-job because it was illegal.\n\n see above\n \nDo you think that pointing out that classifications of \"sin\" are irrelevant to justifications for law is a means of empowering Christians to have power over my life?\n\n no, its not. you said that you personally get around the religious opinions, and ill leave it as that.\n \n bear in mind that a law can be based on somebodies personal belief. you said so yourself. regardless of whether one's personal belief is religious or not, as long as its a personal belief it can be used as leverage in supporting or opposing legal amendment. bear that in mind\n \n \nStop right there sunshine.\n Don't lump me in with anything else. I have never brought up \"American Idol\".\n When I talk of discrimination, I am quite explicit, and I give concrete examples.\n 1) Gays are excluded from military service.\n 2) Gays (and gay couples) are excluded from adopting.\n 3) Gay marriages are not recognized by the government.\n \n Past examples include:\n 4) Sodomy laws.\n 5) Colorado's Amendment #2\n 6) The Psychiatric community's listing of homosexuality as a \"mental illness\".\n \n Another example of discrimination is the Boy Scouts issue, but I actually support the right of the Boy Scouts to exclude gays, as the Boy Scouts are a PRIVATE group. They could exclude people who have an \"E\" in their name if they wanted. That's the type of America I love and live in!\n \n I don't bring up namby-pamby XXXX like \"American Idol\". It's just not even on my radar, and I have no idea what you're even talking about. Go complain about that focus to somebody who is actually talking about it...\n \n In the big scheme of things, I don't think most of the REAL gay rights movement is really caught up in what you're complaining that we're caught up in. Individual gay people might be, and they might be many in numbers, but as far as actual political and legal efforts, they aren't in that category.\n\n here is a article on the american idol incident and another, where gay activist groups like glaad shed some publicity on the issue. from my perspective, it seems to me that they are caught up in these things, but thats just me\n \n \nYeah. But did you know that EVERY GROUP has examples of that?\n There was a Christian \"convention\" recently where a bunch of Christians got together and discussed how they were the next big minority group in America, and how there was a \"War\" on Christianity.\n \n I hate it when gays turn a non-existent mole-hill into a mountain. I hate it when other groups do that too. Cynthia McKinney would be another excellent example.\n\n im glad you agree\n \n \nBut, and I don't know how many times I'll have to say this, I AM NOT INCLUDING those types of issues as a part of the gay rights movement. If I see somebody trying to include them, I'll address them when I see them.\n Can you point me to anybody on this message board (and a post for an example) where they improperly claimed \"victimization\"? \n If so, and I agree with your assessment, I'll be happy to comment on it.\n \n But until then, you are complaining about something you haven't really shown...\n And you'll have to note that you are complaining about something that I AM NOT DOING.\n\n sure i could, but i dont think matthew s would be happy about it, so i wont\n \n \nYeah. And laws against blacks riding in the front of the bus are no more discriminatory than laws against weed smokers and nudists... <end sarcasm<\n The point is the JUSTIFICATION for those laws. Laws against nudity aren't discriminatory against nudists, but rather the ACT of nudity which isn't a right.\n Laws discriminating against homosexuals typically have only one real rationale behind their existence. A bunch of people morally disapprove of gay people. And that isn't a good enough reason...\n \"Our prior cases make two propositions abundantly clear. First, the fact that the governing majority in a State has traditionally viewed a particular practice as immoral is not a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting the practice; neither history nor tradition could save a law prohibiting miscegenation from constitutional attack.\"\n Lawrence v Texas\n (Note, quite clearly, NOT a religious argument...)\n\n actually, moral suasion is the reason most laws are in place, whether they be religious or not, because these moral suasions are people's PERSONAL BELIEFS\n \n \nI really wish you would quit spouting off and start THINKING and LEARNING about the situation first.\n There has NEVER been any scientific research or reason for classifying homosexuality as a mental illness. The only reason they did so was the same reason that everybody else discriminated against gays. Prejudice.\n Just like everybody else.\n \n The Psychiatric community in America was one of the VERY FIRST examples of people questioning the prejudice against homosexuality, which goes to their CREDIT. Not a negative thing...\n \n They were human and made a mistake. They were human and thought like their fellow humans for a while.\n But then they were one of the first to evolve from that limited intellectual state, and conclude something it took the rest of the population longer to realize.\n\n you were the one that brought this up in the first place, and now youre saying that it wasnt scientific? why are you making excuses now? there are lots of \"scientific discoveries\" that people believe are sound but are in fact based on incomplete studies and premature conclusions because the scientists themselves are motivated by personal agendas. the example you gave is just one, but there are quite a few instances this happens\n \n \nOkay now. Complete that line of thinking...\n \n If a straight couple is prohibited from adopting because they aren't married, CAN THEY get married and adopt?\n If a gay couple is prohibited from adopting because they aren't married, CAN THEY get married and adopt?\n \n If gay couples could get married, your response would have merit.\n Until then, it's only half of the story, and missing the best part...\n It's IMPOSSIBLE for a gay couple to adopt in the discussed states, but ALWAYS possible for a unmarried couple to adopt in those states (if 'marriage' is their only restrictor)\n\n the very laws are discriminating against unmarried couples that dont want to get married. so its ok to force 2 unmarried people to get married just so that they can adopt? the point is, gays are acting as though the laws only discriminate against them, when its obvious this is not true\n \n \n1) Show me where I claimed such a document exists...\n 2) I'm not claiming \"there are no restrictions whatsoever as to what types of parties constitute a marriage\". I AM claiming that when restrictions are placed upon marriage, those restrictions need to satisfy 14th amendment tests. If they don't, they are unconstitutional.\n 3) With all that in mind, can you show me what justification exists for preventing gay marriage which satisfies the 14th amendment?\n\n see above\n \n \nYour claim, in and of itself, demonstrates a gross misunderstanding of what \"scientific evidence\" and \"research\" is in the first place, what they can intelligently conclude, and what the research on gay genes has ACTUALLY shown. It rests on denigrating what quality scientific research is, and alleges that the \"gay gene\" research is not quality WITHOUT actually showing anything.\n The research on gay genes hasn't just shown a \"MAY BE\" genetic link.\n They have PROVEN a genetic link.\n\n link me one study that concludes homosexuality has a PROVEN genetic link.\n \n \nThe amount of the Christian religious right attacking the gay community is MUCH GREATER than the \"grassroots level\" of the gay community attacking the Christians.\n I realize you don't believe that, and the only recourse for the evolution of that discussion would seem to be for you to show HOW the \"grassroots level\" of the \"majority of the gay community\" is attacking \"the religious position\".\n\n i just did. you said: \n\"What we ARE doing is saying that despite that religious support, it CANNOT be made into law because it's RELIGION.\n What we ARE doing is \"opposing the matter\" based on our beliefs, which we have a right to do.\"\n",

   "and you qualify \"unjust\" by what measurement?\n\n Constitutional tests.\n I could care less what \"society\" decides for \"society's\" sake. Society is free to have whatever arbitrary opinion and prejudice they please.\n The government is held to a higher standard. The government's first priority is to the constitution. Not to the prejudice of the society's majority...\n \n \n \nlike i said, i have a million and one things in the system i can point out are unjust and discriminatory to me. and since you just told me that all laws that prevent me from doing whatever i want to do are discriminatory, then why should discrimination against one group be more special than discrimination against another group\n\n Take all my statements in context, and don't try to pull them out of context to mean something that they don't.\n You're free to try and take any discrimination you feel is \"unjust\" up in a court of law. But you should probably have some clue as to what measuring stick the court will use in deciding if your complaint is \"unjust\" in the eyes of the court...\n \n \n \ni mentioned banning of public prayer in schools. this is clearly a law that discriminates against christian students and teachers. would you support a cause to prevent christians from being discriminated against by the law?\n\n 0) To answer your question, no.\n 1) Not discriminatory against Christians, specifically. No religion is allowed public prayer in schools.\n 2) You are more than welcome to pray privately in public school. In fact, private and quiet prayer is more in keeping with the Christian religion. Jesus condemned public displays of \"prayer\"...\n 3) Separation of church and state mandates no public prayer in school.\n \n \n \nthe privelleges of adults concerning marriage entails a man and woman legally joining.\n\n Do you even realize that you're defining this issue in purely self-justifying terms? You're not explaining the justification for the discrimination, but rather you're just DEFINING the discrimination and claiming that the right is granted ACCORDING to the discrimination.\n If you can't debate this issue beyond just defining it away, then don't pretend to...\n \n \n \nlike people has pointed out before, the 14th amendment makes sure that nobody is denied these rights. there is no right that says men can marry men, so as such it is not a denial of a right nor a violation of this amendment\n\n A man can marry a woman.\n A woman cannot marry a woman.\n \n That is an unequal right. Discrimination based on gender.\n \n As I have previously pointed out, the 14th amendment application to marriage includes BOTH being capable of marrying, and WHO a person may marry.\n \n \n \nanybody can affect and attempt to influence the laws based on their pesonal beliefs, regardless of where those beliefs come from. christians have the personal belief that a marriage should consist of 2 adult different gendered parents. regardless of whether this is based on a religious teaching or not, it is a belief that christians have the right to express and they have the right to influence the creation or amendment of laws that reinforce or oppose their personal beliefs, just like everybody else in the country\n\n No. They don't.\n As much as you may not realize it, laws restricting people's rights based SOLELY on religion are unconstitutional in this country.\n In fact, I've already given you a SUPREME COURT quote which explicitly stated that \"morality\" was insufficient rationale for justifying laws restricting rights.\n Deny it all you want. You're just not talking about how things REALLY work.\n And unlike you, I'm providing PROOF of my claims...\n \n \n \na response to a non-existent cause is an initiator. i'm not saying that every case of gays making a remark is uncalled for or a false alarm, but a significant amount are.\n\n Again, if you want to complain to somebody who is talking about \"non-existent causes\", then do so.\n Otherwise, your comments are irrelevant and will be ignored as such.\n Either show how the things I am talking about are \"non-existent causes\", or stop bringing them up...\n \n \n \nthere you go again. nobody is oppressing you. its what i just said above. you do understand how a democratic system works, right?\n\n Do you understand how our constitution works? How it protects minorities from the prejudices of the majority?\n \n I gave THREE EXAMPLES of how gays are explicitly discriminated against in this country.\n You completely failed to deny my examples: adoption, military service, and gay marriage.\n In fact, the best response you seemed to be able to muster is that other people are similarly discriminated against.\n Just because you point to other people who are \"oppressed\" like gays doesn't mean gays aren't \"oppressed\".\n \n So now, pull your head out and show me WHY you think those three examples I gave aren't discriminatory. Otherwise, you are yet again ignoring arguments and denying reality...\n \n \n \n2. a law can be influenced based on a PERSONAL belief by a soceity or groupd within the society, regardless of if it is inspired by religion or not.\n\n The FORMATION of that law may be influenced by such.\n But if the JUSTIFICATION for that law ever comes into question, and it turns out that the justification is purely religious, then the law will be thrown out.\n Plain and simple.\n \n \n \ndid i say that i did? compare the number of anti-church gay activists to the number of legal aid gay activists, if you will\n\n Honestly? I can find a long list of \"legal aid gay activists\".\n I wouldn't know where to start in trying to find \"anti-church gay activists\".\n Can you point me to ACTUAL EXAMPLES of \"anti-church gay activists\"?\n \n \n \nits not a case of \"he started it, so hmmph\". gays and christians have been at odds for thousands of years. its only lately that support for gays has surpassed critical mass and the confrontations are more open. so its not a matter of christians initiated anything.\n\n It's a matter of WHY they are fighting.\n If Christians believed what they believed, and left gay men and women alone, then we wouldn't have a problem.\n But Christians have historically enforced their anti-gay opinions onto gays via anti-gay legislation. As such, gays are fighting against the legislation, and ergo, fighting against the rationale used in putting forth the legislation.\n \n I don't understand why you don't see that crucial aspect of the dispute.\n The reason that gays are in the face of Christians is because Christians are sticking their face in the path of gays.\n It's kind of like a man walking down the road. Another man walks up and blocks the first man's path. And so a dispute begins...\n And all you're doing is complaining about the dispute, and telling the first man not to argue with the man who is blocking his path. Which makes NO sense to me at all...\n \n \n \nYou frequently use terms that I just don't understand why you used it.\n Like your claim of \"intimidation\". What \"intimidation\" do you speak of?\n Please. Give an example. \n\n \nhere's an example of from a poster on this forum recently:\n \"What we ARE doing is saying that despite that religious support, it CANNOT be made into law because it's RELIGION.\n What we ARE doing is \"opposing the matter\" based on our beliefs, which we have a right to do.\"\n gays \"have a right\" to oppose a matter \"based on their beliefs\", while christians \"CANNOT\" influence a law based on their beliefs. apparently, what gays believe outrank what a christian believes in the legal system. it sounds kinda like bullying to me\n\n My gawd. That's one of the stupidest things I've ever heard.\n I'm basing my arguments for law on the CONSTITUTION.

And Christians are claiming that they are oppressed?\n \n The point is that many groups have issues like you describe.\n And for the record, it's freedom of speech. The American Idol guy has the \"freedom\" to say what he did, just like others have the \"freedom\" to criticize him for it.\n \n \n \nactually, moral suasion is the reason most laws are in place, whether they be religious or not, because these moral suasions are people's PERSONAL BELIEFS\n\n A lot of \"moral\" issues have a LOT HIGHER claim to justification than just arbitrary claims of \"morality\". Laws against theft? Murder? Prostitution? Drug use? All have a lot better reason for existing than just \"morality\".\n \n But if a law has ONLY the claim of \"morality\" for its justification, then it better watch out. It's days could be numbered....\n \n \n \nyou were the one that brought this up in the first place, and now youre saying that it wasnt scientific? why are you making excuses now?\n\n What \"excuse\"? Acknowledging a mistake is not an \"excuse\"...\n And there is no discontinuity in my argument.\n \n \n \nthere are lots of \"scientific discoveries\" that people believe are sound but are in fact based on incomplete studies and premature conclusions because the scientists themselves are motivated by personal agendas. the example you gave is just one, but there are quite a few instances this happens\n\n There are also a lot of people who use statements like that as a magic wand to ignore legitimate scientific discovery that they don't like. They do so with allegations that the research was improper, while being thoroughly incapable of showing ANY way in which the research was flawed or improper.\n Are you one of those?\n \n \n \nthe very laws are discriminating against unmarried couples that dont want to get married. so its ok to force 2 unmarried people to get married just so that they can adopt? the point is, gays are acting as though the laws only discriminate against them, when its obvious this is not true\n\n That's your point.\n MY point is that gays, unlike straights, have a way around the laws.\n Gays who WANT to get married, but can't, are prohibited from adopting as a couple.\n \n Your complaint is absolutely ridiculous. Here's an analogy.\n A white man wants to see the ball-game, but doesn't want to pay $5 for the ticket.\n A black man wants to see the ball-game, but is prohibited from seeing the game because he is black. He wants to pay the $5, but they still won't let him in.\n \n And there you sit trying to compare the two situations and pretending that they are somehow similar.\n \n \n \ni just did. you said: \n Quote:\n \"What we ARE doing is saying that despite that religious support, it CANNOT be made into law because it's RELIGION.\n What we ARE doing is \"opposing the matter\" based on our beliefs, which we have a right to do.\" \n\n That isn't an \"attack\" on Christianity.\n I can't believe you're pretending that it is...\n It's an attack on THE LAWS DISCRIMINATING against gays.\n It's not an attack on Christianity.\n If anything, your position would be claiming THE CONSTITUTION attacks Christians by refusing to allow religious prejudice into our laws. But I think that's just really silly.\n Freedom of religion means that Christians are free to live by the rules of their religion, and I am free to NOT LIVE by the rules of their religion.\n It works both ways.

   "Also, there are no federal laws barring discrimination against sexual orientation in employment, housing and acccomodation. Sexual orientation is not a protected class, as is religion, gender, race, country of origin, disability (and more?)\n \n A handful of states, and I think about 70 municipalities have such anti-discrimination laws. Clinton signed an executive order in 1998 to outlaw antigay discrimination in the executive branch. It still stands, I think. See the EEOC website. A federal law, ENDA, from the 90s, never made it out of committee. \n \n Last year, the Shays-Waxman bill, the Clarification of Federal Employment Protections Act, H.R. 3128, would have changed the 1977 civil service statute by adding the term \"sexual orientation\" as a basis on which discrimination in the entire federal workforce is prohibited. This never even got voted on in committee.\n \n As such it is legal for me to fire someone solely because they are gay.",

   "Thelmoose beat me to a thought that I had while at the gym, but I'll post mine anyways...\n I think I've got some to add...\n \n \n 1) Separation of church and state is a two-way wall.\n The church is prevented from having religious laws in the government.\n The government is ALSO prevented from having governmental laws in the church.\n If you want to talk about \"oppression\" of religion because religion can't have religious laws in government, then you're going to have to allow government to enact their laws preventing discrimination into the church.\n \n How about it? Shall we level the playing field?\n \n (Reminds me of a statement I once saw:\n Keep religious thought out of the government and we'll keep logical thoughts out of your religion...)\n \n \n 2) If you want to compare the \"oppression\" of Christianity with the \"oppression\" of homosexuality...\n How about we level the playing field there too?\n Make homosexuality classified as a \"religion\"...\n That means that all the laws that prevent discrimination based on religion get applied for homosexuals as well. The same areas where Christians cannot be discriminated against also have laws preventing gays from being discriminated against.\n In exchange, the same restriction which prevents laws from being based on Christian religious laws also restrict laws from being based on \"homosexual\" religious laws...\n \n What do you say? Shall we level the playing field?",

You have made it abundantly clear that you are unwilling to believe there is a heritable component to sexual orientation. You should consider why you are fighting this idea with such ferocity.\n\n actually, i am fully sold out to the idea that sexual orientation is hereditary. incest is twice as hereditary as homosexuality, according to the statistics, so its clear that sexual orientation that run in families are irreputable proof that the sexual orientation is hereditary. homosexuality, heterosexuality, incest, and other forms of sexual orientation, are all controlled by genetics. it would be quite paradoxical to state that only certain types of sexual orientation were caused by genetics, and other types are not, particularly in the light of the fact that statistics actually support the genetic case for hereditary incest twice as much as for hereditary homosexuality. if statistical results of family behaviors represent proof of genetic influence, then how can anyone deny the genetic factors here?\n \n there was another factor in the study that was also particularly interesting. while there were cases where homosexuals where found among families that had absolutely no homosexual relatives, there was never a single case of an isolated incest case where only one member of the family had incestual relations. the question arises, if homosexuality is genetic, where did the genes come from that made a single individual with no gay family history be homosexual. of course, the logical explanation is that the genes were not dominant, and the parents may have been carriers of the gene and not know it. perhaps with the incest gene, its more dominant, which is why it is more pevalent among families with the gene",
