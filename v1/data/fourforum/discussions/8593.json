   "Does a man with conviction scare you? I voted for Mr. Sessions last election because he doesn't just bluster and throw bombs like so many liberal Congressmen (e.g. Howard Dean). His arguments hold water, whether you agree with them or not, and he is one of the few senators who will defend something like keeping a cross up because he feels it is right, not because it is popular. Senator Sessions is one of our few decent senators. If you want to rip on an Alabama senator, by all means please rip Shelby to pieces.",
