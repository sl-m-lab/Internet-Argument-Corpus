   "Today's news seems to show that America isn't unique when it comes to school attacks taking place. Along with the school shootings that seem to take place annually in Germany and last years school stabbings in China, we now have this taking place.\n \n 13 killed in Brazil school shooting - CNN.com\n \n But let's take a look at some of the facts. In Brazil the law specifies that all weapons must be registered with the government, so they legally know where every weapon is and who owns them. In Brazil a person must also obtain a permit before they can legally take a gun outside of the home for any purpose. The minimum age for obtaining said permit is 25, but the gunman was too young to legally acquire such a permit.\n \n According to a BBC News article covering Brazilian gun control laws such permits are only issued to the police, security guards, and other people who are in high risk professions. Anyone caught in possession without a permit faces a four year prison sentence just for the possession alone.",

   "It was a discussion. At no time did I offer support for any legislation. Sure, I suggested that high cap mag legislation was forthcoming as a consequence of events in AZ. It has since been introduced in Congress. Your side has to \"man up\" as well. The sunsetting of 1994 ban has in fact made high cap mags more readily available than they were during the ban.\n\n \n Which is a demonstrable lie that Pietro and Bryan have disproven and shown the proof and law numerous times. You lie more than the ATF if that is possible and as much as the brady bunch.\n \n There is nothing \"forthcoming\"! In fact the SCOTUS has ruled that what is in current use at the time is the most desireable to have and indeed mentioned machine guns also.\n \n By suggesting it genius, you are advocating support for unConstitutional legislation.\n \n Since honesty and court rulings are beyond your grasp, perhaps the floatsum from Japan to soon hit the left coast will keep you occupied and something to really worry about.",

   "Before Bill Clinton took office and before the Brady gun control Act, most people only had only the guns that specifically filled their hobby or need. For instance, I was a competitive skeet shooter. I only had skeet guns. I hunted only occasionally and so I had an all around hunting shotgun too. No rifles and no pistols. None, at all. \n \n However Bill Clinton changed all of that. He didn&#8217;t want people to own so called Assault Weapons. I never really wanted to own a civilian copy of an actual military Assault Weapon, but what the heck, if Bill Clinton didn&#8217;t want me to have an AK 47, then I wanted to have it. So I went out and bought two. Just to be a jerk. However, I was planning to sell them at a later date. I just wanted to be a jerk!\n \n I took one to the range, and had more fun shooting that little rifle than I had had in a long time. So Bill Clinton turned me on to rifles. So, I bought a different variety of rifles. \n \n Handgun Control Inc. and many of the Democrats wanted to ban handguns. They pushed, and pushed, and continually pushed some more. So I went out and purchased the military&#8217;s current side arm. I also took that to the range, and had a whole lot of fun shooting that, so now I have rifles and pistols, several each, and for a variety of different needs and purposes. Why? The Only reason I have any of them is because of gun control. You didn&#8217;t want me to have it, I wanted to be a jerk, so I bought them with the thought of selling them later. But I didn&#8217;t sell them! emoticon_smile Instead, you forced me into buy what I consider a lifetime supply, because you wanted to ban them.\n \n Now people had to think in terms of all of the guns they wanted for their entire lifetime, instead of thinking that one could pick up that gun, or any gun, anytime they wanted. After all you might try and ban them. And it is not like you got the gun control you wanted, and now you are happy and grateful, so you then stopped, in the Early 90's it became the great gun grab fest.\n \n The So-called Assault Weapon ban came, but that never really did anything. And when I say it didn&#8217;t do anything, I mean nothing at all. Why? Because for the most part, you Antis Don&#8217;t know SQUAT about guns. You sound foolish and even stupid when you talk about what certain laws will do and what certain bans will do. We gun owners look at each other in amazement. How foolish and stupid of what the law you want, will actually do.\n \n Your Assault Weapons Ban only banned certain cosmetic looks, but did nothing to effect the action of the firearm. Zero. The same firearms were legally available before and after the ban, that functioned the exact same way, but only looked different. They were the pre Assault Weapons ban hunting and target shooting guns, and shotguns, and use the exact same technology. The Ban did nothing!\n \n Now, don&#8217;t get me wrong. I know that many Antis knew this was just a scam on society, and the Constitution, because you only expected this to be a very small start for all of the taking that you had planned, but what you did instead, was create an overwhelming market for guns. And one that never existed before. Instead of reducing the number of guns in our society, you Geniuses actually manage to massively increase that number. You actually created an overwhelming market for, the exact guns that you wanted to ban. Military looking guns and high capacity handguns! \n \n Take the Sunsetting of the Assault Weapons ban (AWB) and the High Capacity Magazine ban. The ban raised prices, and created a demand for the guns and magazines. It created in me, a market for them that I didn&#8217;t even know I had. Although the AWB did nothing to the functioning of the gun, the pre-ban guns were in shorter supply, so even their used price fetched a premium. Then the ban sunsetted, now EVERYONE wanted a pre-ban look alike, or even several more, just because you guys might try and reenact the ban again. In reality We the people started buying guns and magazines we never really wanted before.\n \n Today, the majority of rifle sales, are what you call assault weapons. The majority of the guns sold now, look and act like the weapons YOU tried to ban. When the ban lifted, Millions upon Millions of these AWB guns flew off the dealer&#8217;s racks like never before. So many that you made the dreaded companies that you HATE, rich. And when I say rich, I mean Mega Rich!!!!!! In today&#8217;s America, everyone has to have an Assault Weapon. \n \n YOU MADE THEM COOL! \n \n So the firearms manufacturers successfully researched how to make these military look alike rifles into hunting rifles and calibers. You even created this demand in a never-ending quantity and at a never-ending pace to boot. \n \n No one wanted high capacity magazines before you started this banning stuff. They were for kooks, and rifle and pistol competitions that were specifically combat practice in nature. You talked about banning them, and you started gun owners looking for lifetime quantity of them, because you might ban them. YOU also made it so that you can&#8217;t sell your high capacity handgun or rifle without at the minimum of 4 high capacity magazines each. Minimum of 4. \n \n During the ban, the price for High Capacity mags. skyrocketed. WHICH, I am sure, is exactly what you wanted to happen, but you did it to the point where even police officers had to weigh the option of carrying more 10 round mags, or spend 125 dollars a piece for the high capacity mags that they needed, and you took from them. Economies of scale. \n \n During the ban, people acquired more handguns that were designed for high capacity, and in record numbers. Why, because these guns fit the hand well and are useful for concealed carry. When the ban lifted, everyone FIRST went out and bough high caps for every pistol or rifle that were designed for them, in a quantity of 4 for each gun. And, since you can&#8217;t be trusted, instead of 4, they bought 6, or more, so they had 4 brand new mags to sell with the gun. Premium pricing. Belly up to the bar, because YOU did that! emoticon_smile \n \n Many gun owners who shoot these styles of guns all of the time, bought what they figured was a lifetime supply, meaning 8, 10, or even more, high capacity Magazines. \n \n Then you started talking about bans again in the recent legislative push. What pray tell do you think happened? It&#8217;s not what you expected. Manufacturers started producing overtime, and gun owners who don&#8217;t want to get caught short, hit their credit cards for everything they could afford. Handguns, and so called Assault styled Weapons too! emoticon_smile Great job!\n \n People new to shooting, had to decide weather or not they want to own a gun, and specifically the guns you want to ban. Backfired again! \n \n OK, so you did not get your ban. Now all of those overproduced high capacity magazines are going to be dirt cheap, causing people who see a great price, to purchase even more, because they are so cheap. This cheap they never will be again. \n \n Ammo too. Instead of purchasing ammo on the way to the range, gun owners NOW have to keep a supply of ammo on hand just in case you get frogy about ammo too! After all, You proved that you can&#8217;t be trusted!\n \n The gun industry could not have designed a better money-making scheme than the market that you antis supplied for them! \n \n   Total NICS Background Checks Nov 30 1998 to March 31 2011 \n Total = 128 million, 674 thousand, 021. checks. \n \n \n There were only an estimated 250 million guns in America before NISC went into operation. Now how many are there? Mostly new Assault styled looking guns and high capacity handguns too. Great job!!!!\n \n \n During the last Presidential campaign, you geniuses talked about how no one needs an Assault Weapon, and you talked about banning them. \n \n WHAT did you expect would happen? \n \n Instead, let me tell you what you MADE happen. You took an industry that previously sold how ever many guns that correspond with about 8 million background checks a year and pushed that figure to 14 million background checks a year. Assault weapons and high cap mags. \n \n YOU TALK, People Buy! Get it!\n \n Like most people, I had zero rifles and pistols before Clinton. How many pistols and military style rifles and high capacity magazines do I own? You don&#8217;t want to know! Seriously, You really don&#8217;t! Because I WANT to be a Jerk every time YOU TALK! And you talked a lot! You made me want to hit the NRA tip jar on the way out the door, to boot! \n \n However, I do want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for all of the fun and joy of ownership that I would have never had if you didn&#8217;t start all of this gun control stuff, in the first place. I personally would have only ever owned the 2 shotguns I had before you started all of this gun control stuff. As I got older and more disabled, I found a hobby in target shooting that I can do, and really enjoy though my elderly years. So thanks for all of the joy I presently enjoy! \n \n What did you actually control? Nothing. Except you did control the panic buying pace that has lasted for the almost 20 years? \n \n My best advice for your younger guys and gals, buy stock in gun manufacturing, because the Antis don&#8217;t know how to stop taking! emoticon_smile",
