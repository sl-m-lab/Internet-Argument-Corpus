   "Great idea to help a cause right here on this board! Please read on!\n \n Think for a minute about everything that you did from 1977-1997. Now, \n erase it all. That's 20 years gone - BOOM - just like that. I'm only \n 21, so that would be a LIFETIME.\n \n I saw a play that really moved me called \"The Exonerated\". In short, \n the play tells the TRUE stories of people who spent years on death row \n before being found innocent and set free.\n \n The play ran for years, but unfortunately, isn't running anymore. But I \n just saw Court TV is doing a film-version of the same play with some \n bigtime actors/actresses i.e. Danny Glover, Susan Sarandon, etc.. It \n airs on Jan.27th @ 9PM, but I'd check their site to be sure if it's the \n same in your time zone or whatever. www.courttv.com\n \n I'm hoping that I could collect more people's opinions here so I can \n print and mail them to my Congressman and even my Governor. Letters \n from actually people are powerful! Here's a link to another \n documentary, which gave me the idea of how to get involved! \n http://deadlinethemovie.com/get_involved/take_action.php\n \n So if you have thoughts on the death penalty, please share them here. \n Just imagine if it was you, or your friend, or family sitting innocent \n on death row. FYI One of my favorite songs has the line, \"If you're not \n going to make something better, than you're just IN THE WAY!\" Let's \n all make something better right now.\n \n Thanks so much!\n Sylvia",

He was poor and couldn't afford a lawyer. The lawyer the state provided bragged about how he never took more papers than could fit in his pocket. The most evidence the prosecution had was that on that day he had been with those people. He sent letters to many people and he finally got a response from a professor at the University of Maryland. He had his law students write briefs and stuff that was actually used. With their help the governor of the state has now pardened him. He was in college when it happened. He is now in his 50's I think. It's pretty sad how a system like this can result in something like that happening.
