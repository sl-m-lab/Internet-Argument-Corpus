   "In 1926 or 1927 there was a massive flood from one end of the Mississippi River to the other. It was the Hurricane Katrina of its day, but at the time we didn't have the federal infrastructure that we have today that is supposed to enable the government to deal with large natural disasters. Nothing like FEMA or Homeland Security existed.\n \n But somehow or another Herbert Hoover, who as Secretary of Commerce at the time, managed to be put in charge of the federal relief and recovery effort. Hoover was so successful in dealing with the flood crisis that his nomination as the Republican Party's presidential candidate in 1928 was a given. Hoover even managed to win Texas, Florida, Tennessee, North Carolina and Virginia- southern states that had not supported the Republican presidential candidate since the end of Reconstruction.\n \n So why was Hoover so inept when it came to dealing with the Great Depression?",
