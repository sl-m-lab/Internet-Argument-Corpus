   "House GOP Lists $2.5 Trillion in Spending Cuts - US News and World Report\n \n House GOP Lists $2.5 Trillion in Spending Cuts \n \n \nMoving aggressively to make good on election promises to slash the federal budget, the House GOP today unveiled an eye-popping plan to eliminate $2.5 trillion in spending over the next 10 years. Gone would be Amtrak subsidies, fat checks to the Legal Services Corporation and National Endowment for the Arts, and some $900 million to run President Obama's healthcare reform program.\n\n \n So they are going to \"save\" us $900 million by eliminating the health care reform that the CBO says will save us $230 billion in the same time period? \n \n Somebody does not seem to know how to use their freaking calculator.\n \n \nDiscretionary Spending Limit, FY 2012-2021: Eliminate automatic increases for inflation from CBO baseline projections for future discretionary appropriations. Further, impose discretionary spending limits through 2021 at 2006 levels on the non-defense portion of the discretionary budget. $2.29 trillion savings over ten years.\n\n \n Freezing spending is NOT savings. \"Savings\" means cutting expenses, not guessing what we WOULD spend in the future and cutting that budget by deciding we will only spend as much as we are right now.\n \n \n\n Federal Workforce Reforms: Eliminate automatic pay increases for civilian federal workers for five years. Additionally, cut the civilian workforce by a total of 15 percent through attrition. Allow the hiring of only one new worker for every two workers who leave federal employment until the reduction target has been met. (Savings included in above discretionary savings figure).\n\n \n This I pretty much support without reservation EXCEPT for the fact that it does not go far enough. 15%?? Try 35% for a real dent.\n \n \nEliminate federal control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. $30 billion total savings.\n\n \n I like this one, but there needs to be an actual plan in place for what happens following that. Currently the GSA's are funding over 90% of new mortgages in the US. They can only do this because of the explicit backing of the US government. Take that away and we can kiss the housing market goodbye COMPLETELY. Literally trillions of dollars in GSA paper that currently holds a AAA rating would be downgraded to junk overnight. Pension funds would be wiped out. It would make the last crash look like a little hiccup. \n \n Trying to do this without a plan in place is childish and horrifyingly ignorant. \n \n The article then lists 100 programs they intend to cut. In truth, I would not be sorry to see most of them go. A few of them we should probably keep around, though. \n \n \n\n Legal Services Corporation. $420 million annual savings. \n\n \n LSC provides funding for legal aid programs so the middle and lower classes can actually afford some kind of legal representation. \n \n IF we are going to have a legal system that is so complex that my attorney cannot confidently give me answers to questions about what is legal and what is not, we need legal aid programs. If they want to cut legal aid, they need to simplify our legal system. \n \n \n\n Hope VI Program. $250 million annual savings.\n\n \n Hope VI is a program that deals with severely distressed public housing. If the government is going to be in the landlord business, they need this program. If they are going to eliminate the program that covers most of the maintenance and renovation costs for public housing, they need to sell off the public housing. Deciding you are going to save money by not fixing your leaky roof is false economy. \n \n \nCut Federal Travel Budget in Half. $7.5 billion annual savings.\n\n \n This is great!! Do they not need to travel? Are they going to be riding bikes instead??? If we are going to cut the federal travel budget, somebody needs to have some kind of idea of what we are cutting and why. So far all I have seen on this is that they plan to cut it. Is there excessive travel going on now?\n \n \nIntercity and High Speed Rail Grants. $2.5 billion annual savings.\n\n \n Step in the wrong direction. One function of government is supposed to be to encourage infrastructure development.\n \n \nApplied Research at Department of Energy. $1.27 billion annual savings.\n\n \n BIG, HUGE step in the wrong direction. I have worked with the folks at Applied Research at the DOE before and it is pretty much the DARPA of the energy world. \n \n \nIRS Direct Deposit: Require the IRS to deposit fees for some services it offers (such as processing payment plans for taxpayers) to the Treasury, instead of allowing it to remain as part of its budget. $1.8 billion savings over ten years.\n\n \n This is not savings, this is moving money from the right side of the bucket to the left, and the IRS charges those fees to cover the cost of providing those services.\n \n \nProhibit taxpayer funded union activities by federal employees. $1.2 billion savings over ten years.\n\n \n This should have happened 30 years ago.\n \n\n Sell excess federal properties the government does not make use of. $15 billion total savings.\n\n \n Again....more specific information is required here. Are we talking about the missile silos down the road from my house that have been empty since the 70's, or are we talking about yellowstone??\n \n \nEliminate death gratuity for Members of Congress.\n\n \n Add \"and retirement benefits\" to that and you are getting somewhere.....\n \n \nEliminate fund for Obamacare administrative costs. $900 million savings.\n\n \n Eliminating $900 million a year in administrative costs from a program that saves you 2.3 billion a year is stupid.\n \n Then they need to stop being id10ts and stop exempting military spending from cuts. THEN we might get somewhere.",

   "House GOP Lists $2.5 Trillion in Spending Cuts - US News and World Report\n \n House GOP Lists $2.5 Trillion in Spending Cuts \n \n2.5 trillion over 10 years, right? Which equates to something like 3% cuts a year. What a joke.

David Walker also explained why it was a farce. Nevertheless, it won't save us a dime either because the cuts should be based on what we have this very second...You shouldn't cut something after you raise it.\n \n \nThis I pretty much support without reservation EXCEPT for the fact that it does not go far enough. 15%?? Try 35% for a real dent.\n \nI think 15% is great for the first year. Then 10% second and 5% the third. Honestly, that's all you need. You are better off forcing these folks to retire. We should also implement a law that if you retire and come back as a federal contractor or your job is paid for by more than 60% of federal funds than you are treated as if you are a federal employee again thus not double dipping. \n \n \nI like this one, but there needs to be an actual plan in place for what happens following that.

Frankly the projects under this are pathetic. Tampa to Orlando? Really? Build a better road and get over it. The Tampa to Orlando passenger service route is not holding up the Orange Juice business. We honestly should develop the Northeast corridor to be all TRUE high speed rail (aka 180-200mph) to clear the routes for freight trains.

   "2.5 trillion over 10 years, right? Which equates to something like 3% cuts a year. What a joke. State governments literally cut 10-15% overnight. \n\n \n Yep....but the talking heads are already yelling \"2.5 TRILLION\" like it is quite the accomplishment. \n \n\n In fairness to the GOP, there is no chance the bill will save $230 billion and the head of the CBO basically has admitted it. David Walker also explained why it was a farce. Nevertheless, it won't save us a dime either because the cuts should be based on what we have this very second...You shouldn't cut something after you raise it.\n\n \n That is what all their cuts are based on. We are going to raise 20%, then cut 5%, and those silly asians will not realize we have actually increased 15%, so they will keep buying our junk bonds. \n \n Bad news. The asians make calculators, I am sure they know how to use them. \n \n \nI think 15% is great for the first year. Then 10% second and 5% the third. Honestly, that's all you need. You are better off forcing these folks to retire. We should also implement a law that if you retire and come back as a federal contractor or your job is paid for by more than 60% of federal funds than you are treated as if you are a federal employee again thus not double dipping. \n\n \n Now you are talking! \n \n \n \nThat problem is with the states, I say eliminate it. Not only that but lawyers are easy to come by these days. That profession shot themselves in the foot and now law students can't get jobs and pay is going to go down...unless you are a patent or copyright lawyer.\n\n \n I can go for that IF they expand the equal access to justice laws. EAJ laws essentially state that if you end up having to go up against the government and you win, the government foots the bill for your attorney and defense. EAJ covers MSHA and OSHA proceedings (not sure what else). Of course, if they cut the federal workforce enough, we would have fewer federal employees standing around looking for ways to screw you, so that might be a self limiting problem. \n \n \n \nThey should cut it more. Virginia colleges and agencies as well cut their travel budgets to almost nothing and we are fine. It's called video-conferencing. State employees basically traveled for various conferences because it was 1) fun 2) get away from the office 3)you get your continuing education credits. Hell, as an accountant we have 40 hrs a year. Cut the travel budget and you basically do all of that via a LAN line.\n\n \n I just want to know what we are cutting, why, and can we cut it deeper??? This is line item that has no explanation behind it. Does this mean my MSHA inspectors will no longer be able to travel to my sites? Does it mean the FBI will no longer be able to transport agents to investigate kidnapping cases? Does it mean that congressmen will be flying business class instead of being ferried around on their own 727s? \n \n This just sounds like one of those things they toss out because it sounds good. Saying \"cut travel budget by 50%\" is not a plan. A plan tells us where we will be cutting it from and what, if anything, we will be losing by doing it. \n \n \nI dunno about this one. We need to either sh*t or get off the pot when it comes to high speed rail. Frankly the projects under this are pathetic. Tampa to Orlando? Really? Build a better road and get over it.

We honestly should develop the Northeast corridor to be all TRUE high speed rail (aka 180-200mph) to clear the routes for freight trains. It would also be easier for businesses to get from close cities. \n \n\n \n Yes and no. We need to make MAJOR improvements to our transportation infrastructure. Whether we are looking at a peak in oil production or not, one thing that has become crystal clear is that we can no longer rely on cheap hydrocarbons. We need to have a better system in place than \"everybody drives an SUV everywhere they go\". This is especially true given our fiscal situation. As things get worse for the middle and lower class, we need the cost efficiency of a modern transportation system. \n \n We need more inter-modal yards and we need to eliminate the prohibitions against mixing passenger and freight cars on the same train. Right now, Amtrack is expensive (in many cases more expensive that taking a plane) because they are running mostly empty trains, which significantly impacts their bottom line. If they were allowed to mix in freight with their passenger trains, the freight haulage would cover the cost of the trip which would significantly decrease the passenger cost. \n \n \nThey exempted basically the top 3 areas of spending which alone eat up the entire revenue stream for the year. It is insulting.\n\n \n What...exempting your mortgage payment from you monthly budget is not a good plan??? That is the american way!!!!\n \n \nHere is actually one I DON'T support that was not on your list:\n \n Subsidy for Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. $150 million annual savings.\n \n The federal government created a nightmare in DC getting around so they should pay for the cost of people to GET to work.

Frankly, any plan to deal with federal employees outrageous pay will cause a problem for the DC area (housing, etc) but not much choice.\n\n \n Ok, yea, I can go with that.

I'm a big train fan and was about to write some of the same things. The Northeast routes are all profitable because Amtrak owns most of the lines. Honestly, Amtrak should become a city to city type service with their own lines at high speed and nothing more. Chicago to Los Angles will never be a profitable venture and frankly the only reason they still run it is because of sentimental purposes. DC to New York in 2 hrs on a train at a lower cost is by far a better service than a 1.5hr plane ride where you get feel up from a 40yr old man on the way.\n \n Now, don't confuse this with my Orlando to Tampa example. If you studied that plan it is city to city but frankly no one cares about going slightly faster from Orlando to Tampa at a huge cost to the user and huge loss to the state.",

The host said to Forbes, \"I am going to ask you a direct question and I would like a direct answer; how much oil does the U.S. have in the ground?\" Forbes did not miss a beat, he said, \"more than all the Middle East put together.\" Please read below. \n \n The U. S. Geological Service issued a report in April 2008 that only scientists and oil men knew was coming, but man was it big. It was a revised report (hadn't been updated since 1995) on how much oil was in this area of the western 2/3 of North Dakota, western South Dakota, and extreme eastern Montana ..... check THIS out: \n \n The Bakken is the largest domestic oil discovery since Alaska 's Prudhoe Bay , and has the potential to eliminate all American dependence on foreign oil. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates it at 503 billion barrels. Even if just 10% of the oil is recoverable... at $107 a barrel, we're looking at a resource base worth more than $5...3 trillion. \n \n \"When I first briefed legislators on this, you could practically see their jaws hit the floor. They had no idea..\" says Terry Johnson, the Montana Legislature's financial analyst. \n \n \"This sizable find is now the highest-producing onshore oil field found in the past 56 years,\" reportsThe Pittsburgh Post Gazette. It's a formation known as the Williston Basin , but is more commonly referred to as the 'Bakken.' It stretches from Northern Montana , through North Dakota and into Canada . For years, U. S. oil exploration has been considered a dead end. Even the 'Big Oil' companies gave up searching for major oil wells decades ago. However, a recent technological breakthrough has opened up the Bakken's massive reserves..... and we now have access of up to 500 billion barrels. And because this is light, sweet oil, those billions of barrels will cost Americans just $16 PER BARREL! \n \n That's enough crude to fully fuel the American economy for 2041 years straight. And if THAT didn't throw you on the floor, then this next one should - because it's from 2006! \n \n U.. S. Oil Discovery- Largest Reserve in the World \n \n Stansberry Report Online - 4/20/2006 \n \n Hidden 1,000 feet beneath the surface of the Rocky Mountains lies the largest untapped oil reserve in the world. It is more than 2 TRILLION barrels. On August 8, 2005 President Bush mandated its extraction. In three and a half years of high oil prices none has been extracted. With this motherload of oil why are we still fighting over off-shore drilling? \n \n They reported this stunning news: We have more oil inside our borders, than all the other proven reserves on earth.. Here are the official estimates: \n - 8-times as much oil as Saudi Arabia \n \n - 18-times as much oil as Iraq \n \n - 21-times as much oil as Kuwait \n \n - 22-times as much oil as Iran \n \n - 500-times as much oil as Yemen \n \n - and it's all right here in the Western United States . \n \n HOW can this BE? HOW can we NOT BE extracting this? Because the environmentalists and others have blocked all efforts to help America become independent of foreign oil! Again, we are letting a small group of people dictate our lives and our economy.....WHY? \n \n James Bartis, lead researcher with the study says we've got more oil in this very compact area than the entire Middle East -more than 2 TRILLION barrels untapped. That's more than all the proven oil reserves of crude oil in the world today, reports The Denver Post.\n \n Don't think 'OPEC' will drop its price - even with this find? Think again! It's all about the competitive marketplace, - it has to. Think OPEC just might be funding the environmentalists? \n \n \n By the way...this is all true. Check it out at the link below!!! \n GOOGLE it, or follow this link. \n \n USGS Release: 3 to 4.3 Billion Barrels of Technically Recoverable Oil Assessed in North Dakota and Montana's Bakken Formation-25 Times More Than 1995 Estimate- (4/10/2008 2:25:36 PM) \n",

   "I got this in an email the other day.\n\n \n Sadly, it is bull droppings. A similar bunch of bull droppigns made the round a while back. The Email you got stole the numbers from there. \n \n Snopes:\n \n snopes.com: Bakken Formation\n \n This was not a secret report that only oil industry insiders and scientist knew about...this was a report that pretty much everybody in the energy investment world knew was coming and signed up to receive.\n \n First, the USGS estimated 2-4.3 billion recoverable barrels from bakken, not the 503 billion barrel fabrication in your email. \n \n As Snopes points out, the US imports 10 million barrels of oil a day, so if you put that up against a mean estimate of 3.65 billion barrels that we could suck out of the Bakken formation tomorrow, all that means is that we would not have to import any oil for a SINGLE YEAR. \n \n I have trouble getting excited about that since the real problem with the bakken formation is the slow production. They are using horizontal wells and hydrofracturing to get the oil. Unfortunately that means that a $200 million well that could be expected to produce 300 barrels a day in a good formation can only average 50-100 barrels a day in the bakken formation. It is an insurmountable problem....one of those \"laws of physics\" things, you can only make oil flow through rock so fast. \n \n Currently best estimates are that with an all out, ballsto the wall effort where we say \"screw the environment\" and just \"drill baby drill\" in both the bakken formation and the green mountain formation (colorado), in 20-35 years we could possibly get as much as 5% of our total daily oil consumption from shale oil. \n \n Those are not particularly good numbers. \n \n The Hess corporation is pretty much the king of the bakken reservoir. They are the biggest gas producers there, the third biggest oil producers, and the biggest refiners (which is HUGE since there are basically no pipelines to get the product to market so they refine in the region so they can truck finished product instead of crude). They have been operating in the bakken basin since the 50's. If you look at their annual report, despite being the third biggest oil producer there, they have consistently lost money on their oil production at bakken and had to cover the losses with profits from their refining and gas operations. \n \n That is the problem with oil. You see these HUGE numbers and they look good, but when you actually put it against consumption it is just a drop in the bucket. The other problem is that technically recoverable reserves are absolutely meaningless without extraction rates to go with them. Sure, there is a giant oil field at Bakken. We will still be pumping there in 100 years because it is a VERY slow producer. There is a bunch of oil at ANWAR! YEA! Exciting until you realize that even if we use the most optimistic numbers for production, ANWAR will never supply more than about .5% of our daily usage.",

   "Karl Rove: Obama Versus Bush on Spending - WSJ.com\n\n \n I have already read it. Subtract the $3 trillion that the Bush tax cuts cost us, the $1 trillion in bailouts that were passed during the bush adminstration but not funded until Obama was in office, and the $700 billion that Bushs prescription drug program cost us, and there is only one conclusion that can be drawn.\n \n Both the Bush administration and the Obama administration have been a fiscal train wreck for the US. Blaming the bankrptcy of America on Obama alone though is foolish. The only big spending program that he actually instituted was his bailout at $700 billion. Cheap compared to..well..pretty much any of Bushs big programs. \n \n \n \n \nThere are opinions from both extremes concerning the Bakken formation. That email gave one, and you of course gave the other, the EPA/liberal one. Obviously, the truth is somewhere in between those two extremes. \n\n \n No, Marc, that Email did not give one opinion on the Bakken formation. It put forth information that absolutely, without question, verifiably FALSE. It was not an opinion. It was not a possible outcome. It was simply a bunch of bull XXXX lies. \n \n I also did not post any opinions. I posted facts and math. I have no \"opinion\" on the Bakken formation. I just have a calculator and an ability to read factual reports on the thing. \n \n If relying on cold, hard, mathematically verifiable facts is the \"EPA/liberal\" view, then sign me up. Funny, but in the past the conservatives were typically considered the analytical thinkers...the guys who did the math. \n \n So, dont pretend you are putting forth some kind of valid argument here. The numbers in your Email are absolutely and without question WRONG. They have been shown to be absolutely and without question WRONG. There is no argument or opinion there. If you want to continue relying on that Email as a feel good crutch, go ahead, but dont pretend that it is anything but that. \n \n \nBut the political truth is that the EPA will see to it that practically no kind of factual examination of the area will take place this year, while gasoline and diesel fuel prices go up to 4, probably $5 a gallon by years end (as is currentlly predicted).\n \n \n Complete and utter BS. All segments of the Bakken formation are currently under drilling leases, which means all the environmental have been done. The Bakken formation is actually one of the really simple ones out there. There are no surprises. We know exactly what is there because the geography through the entire region is static and we have drilled all the way through the formation in several places. \n \n \nTonight in his state of the union speech, Obama will impress many Americans with his talk of unlocking the productivity of American workers, unleashing the ingenuity of American businesses, and harnessing the dynamism of America&#8217;s economy, and no one will ask him about the EPA&#8217;s permit revocation of Arch Coals proposed Spruce number one mine in West Virginia a little over a week ago. \n\n \n And they damn well should have. Teh Bush administration should never have issued the permits. Do you know what they were planning to do, Marc? They intended to literally dump over 100 million cubic yard of high selenium coal mining waste direct5ly into streams. You do realize that a lot of coal mining waste is radioactive, right? And these were streams that literally feed directly into town and city water supplies. \n \n It is absolutely ridiculous that those permits were ever issued. This is not a case where we are stopping progress because some fish that nobody has ever heard of would suffer. This is literally case where tens of thousands of people would have been been exposed to toxic levels of selenium. \n \n Sorry, Marc, but if you cant support pulling that permit given those facts, you are just plain evil. \n \n \nThe EPA destroys unlocking, unleashing, and harnessing, and has far more power that Obama does. Obama will talk of fiscal responsibility, all the while continuing to borrow money from China and print more money, partially to fund and increase the size of that same EPA. And you and Steeeve will continue to defend him every chance you get, call for tax increases just like him and Barney Frank, bash Bush/the tea party movement, and call yourselves conservatives. Yawn.\n\n \n If you are a conservative, then the liberals have got all the facts on their side. I do not support Obama, and sure as hell do not support his fiscal policies. \n \n I support raising taxes because I love my country and it is an absolute, unquestionable, mathematical fact that the United States of America will FAIL as a nation if we do not. NO MORE USA. That is not even debatable, that is simple math. \n \n Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the federal reserve, literally got up in front of the US congress and told them that the first thing he does every morning, before he even gets dressed, is check the price of US Treasuries to make sure the US did not fail while he was sleeping.\n \n For the last 15 years EVERY SINGLE report that the joint chiefs have sent to congress has identified our lack of national infrastructure and our DEBT as the biggest threat to America. Not terrorists. Not a nuclear armed Iran or N Korea, but our own spending habits.\n \n AND YET, we have STUPID, LAZY, IGNORANT, GREEDY people who are not only unwilling to see taxes raised to SAVE OUR COUNTRY, they are so GREEDY that they demand that taxes be LOWERED so they can keep more.\n \n What kind of person are you, Marc? Sometimes you seem like decent kind of guy. Have you ever been to a third world country? Have you ever been somewhere that the government has collapsed? That is LITERALLY what you are advocating leaving to your children and grandchildren when you oppose taking the steps we need to take to to address our economic problems.",

I know Obama is a smart guy, so is Bush Jr. I say \"no brains\" as in their policy ideas are just awful and have no foresight. By \"no class\" I mean both no guts and no respect for things. Being close to DC you get to know many secret service agents. Without fail, and granted this is only my account, they say Reagan was by far the most respectful and then both Bush's but they point out Reagan was amazing to them. Apparently Obama is a bit of a snob (as was Nixon ha). This also comes out when it talks such as his speech tonight. We aren't children who need to be told what to do. I'm not suggesting you have to be a nice guy to be president but Obama, in my opinion, is just a no class guy and that is very unfortunate.

So you don't believe Rove's numbers above?\n They are misleading. The Fiscal Year for the federal government ends Sept 30. So it depends no when you wanna start counting years. Furthermore, spending doesn't always line up with policy enactments. Medicare Part D, for example, costs $800 billion over 10 years. Bush was only in office for about 2-3 of those where the spending was ramped up. TARP and the first stimulus were also under Bush but often times counted in the Obama numbers due to the fiscal year I'm referring to. I'd be interested to know here Rove got his numbers from to see if he did that too. Revenue also went down for Obama which makes the deficit worse. \n \n In short, Obama is a deficit spender guy to the max but so was Bush. Given the choice between the two I'd pick a frog to be president. \n \n \nWhen you first started posting here, I believe you actually knew what the word \"liberal\" meant.

It is my opinion that you don't vote anyone unless they promise to balance the budget within a reasonable timeframe. If that means some liberal or religious conservative will win cause you didn't vote for the \"lesser of two evils\" than so be it. Just let your reasons be known.\n\n \n The problem is the partisanship in this country. Some people just cant seem to get their head around the fact that I, for example, have a deep and abiding hatred of both Bush Jr and Obama. I feel compelled to listen to what BOTH parties have to say before I decide which is the \"good\" one and which is the \"bad\" one on any issue, and I generally operate on the principal that BOTH parties are evil and looking to screw us. Overall, there is no \"good\" side and there is no \"bad\" side. Both parties suck sweaty monkey nuts. They are both staffed by, and controlled by, elitist scum that is more than happy to throw the rest of us under the bus so they can make another billion. \n \n When we are assigning \"liberal\" and \"conservative\" views to freaking geological surveys, things have gone too far. \n \n If being a good party member means blindly following whatever garbage your parties leadership throws out, then it is not possible to be a good party member and a good American. If you are a good American, when a bunch of politicians stand up and say \"We are going to solve the national debt problem by defunding NPR\" it is your DUTY as an american to jump up an yell \"BULLDROPPINGS\" no matter WHICH party they represent.",

   " What is disturbing is almost no liberals, that I can think of, are fiscally responsible! I personally know lots of liberal voters who have this as an important issue too!\n \n\n \n You may be right in that, but On the other hand I see no Conservatives who are fiscally responsible either. Sure most all of them will talk a good game but when they go and do the opposite they're just as bad. I've said before, concerning the Federal Level I don't know of a Honest politician. Republicans seem to be a bit better at convincing Americans that they are fiscally responsible, but in truth they spend just as much if not more on less . They preach \" Smaller Government\" but then build a larger Military. And Cutting taxes like they do is not what I would consider fiscally responsible. I've always believed the old adage that Republicans are Borrow and spend and Democrats are tax and spend. They both spend about the same amount of money but republicans are just a bit better at masking what they do to the Public.\n \n To be honest I've only ever called myself a Liberal because for many years I was only concerned with Social issues. I'm Pro Choice, so it never seemed right to call myself a Conservative because they are mostly Against Abortions. It was only after Clinton's first Term that I became interested in the economics of politics. So I guess I'm more in the Middle than I realized, cause I am against ignorant spending.",

If we assume that the $6.8 billion goes to pay that $8 billion in overdue unfunded liabilities this year, that means that they still have a $15 billion budget deficit, plus $1.2 in overdue unfunded liabilities. \n \n What is pathetic is that with the tax hike in Illinois (which comes nowhere CLOSE to covering their budgetary shortfall) they passed what they called a DRASTIC 2% annual growth cap on spending. HUH!?!? That means that even with the tax increase, the deficit will continue to GROW for all future years. That is NOT addressing your spending problems.

We did raid the retirement system last year which was a bad step but we plan on fixing that this year and are not facing a \"budget shortfall\" as many websites would have you believe. Most counties in Virginia are not expecting layoffs this year and or salary cuts. I actually think revenue is a little above budget for the year as well. Bad states are ones that have unlimited debt amounts, bad budget rules, and high debt to GSP ratios. You also need to look at infrastructure of the state, business opportunities, unfunded liabilities, etc.\n \n In other words, its everything.

It wouldn't hurt my feelings if they simply withdraw all of our troops and cut the military by 45 to 50 %. \n \n Education\n \n Disagree. I think they should put more into Education not take away.\n \n \n Energy\n \n Agreed\n \n Health and Human Services\n \n This proposal takes\n most of the agency's discretionary programs back to FY2008 levels, and makes further reductions to the\n Public Health Service programs.\n \n Agreed but they should go deeper. \n \n Food and Drug Administration: Reduce 62 Percent\n Health Resources and Services Administration: Reduce 34 Percent\n National Institute of Health: Reduce 37 Percent\n \n Agreed\n \n Homeland Security\n Transportation Security Administration: Reduce 40 Percent\n U.S. Coast Guard: Transfer to Department of Defense at FY2008 Levels\n \n In my opinion they should completely eliminate the department of Homeland security. It's just another Political cash cow and can be used to strip Americans of rights. It's time Americans stopped believing in the boogie man , we didn't need this in 93 when terrorists hit the world trade center and we didn't need it because of 9/11. \n \n Housing and Urban Development\n \n Interior\n Land and Mineral Management: Reduce 50 percent\n Bureau of Reclamation: Eliminate\n Bureau of Indian Affairs: Eliminate\n \n Have to admit I don't know near enough about this one to make a judgment. \n \n Labor\n a re-evaluation of the emergency unemployment benefits, as well as the extended unemployment benefits that provide up to 99 weeks- or nearly 2 years of unemployment benefits.\n \n Agreed. Unemployment should go back to previous levels. 2 years of unemployment is way too much strain on our economy. \n \n State\n \n Transportation\n The proposal includes funding the Federal Highway Administration and the Federal Transit Administration at the level of projected gas tax revenue of $37 billion. The proposal eliminates Amtrak subsidies, and reduces the remainder of the department back to FY2008 levels, with an additional reduction of 20 percent.\n \n Agree and Disagree. Sounds good up front but funding at the level of gas tax revenue leaves an open end for them to raise gas taxes to increase funding. Eliminating Amtrak subsidies will end up costing more jobs when Amtrak cannot sustain itself and is forced to shut down. \n \n Federal Highway Administration and Federal Transit Administration: Funded at Gas Tax Levels\n \n As I said above.. this leaves an open end for them to raise gas taxes at will to increase the funding. I don't like the wording of this one. If he's serious then freeze the level at current gas taxes then we'll talk.\n \n Amtrak Subsidies: Eliminate\n Created by an act of Congress in 1970 to provide passenger rail service, Amtrak has yet to turn a yearly profit. During its first 35 years, federal assistance amounted to approximately $30 billion. Yet from FY2007 to FY2010 that number has increased by $7 billion. Of the 44 routes and 21,000 miles of track the trains travel over, only 625 miles are actually owned by Amtrak. Congress has forced freight rail companies to allow Amtrak to use the lines the freight rail companies own and maintain.\n \n Agree and Disagree. \n \n Although I agree something needs to be done killing Amtrak through de-funding is not the way to go. I say this is one area where we should invest instead. An up front investment in building a system of high speed rails will create jobs, will give Amtrak their own right of way, will eliminate the need to lease rails from the major railroads and would be much better for Americans . \n \n \n Environmental Protection Agency  -- Some cuts are needed but I'm not sure I agree just yet.\n International Assistance Programs -- Eliminate at will.\n \n National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n \n Another useless cash cow that could be eliminated . We've been to the moon, there's no need to spend all this money to try and get back. As far as I'm concerned NASA is a waste, we should be worried about the world we live on and not the one we'll never see.\n \n National Science Foundation -\n Affordable Housing Program -\n Commission on Fine Arts - Eliminated\n Consumer Product Safety Commission - Eliminated\n Corporation for Public Broadcasting - Eliminated\n National Endowment of Arts - Eliminated\n National Endowment for Humanities - Eliminated\n \n Agreed on all of these.\n \n \n Federal Communications Commission\n \n Another One that I think is not needed.\n \n Overall I think most of this is a good start, although I doubt it will carry much weight with Obama. According to his speech last night he's intent on more spending , only now he's calling it Investments. Some of it I agreed with, some not so much. I just hope they can all agree on some common ground and get something done.",

   "No, Marc, that Email did not give one opinion on the Bakken formation. It put forth information that absolutely, without question, verifiably FALSE. It was not an opinion. It was not a possible outcome. It was simply a bunch of bull XXXX lies. \n \n I also did not post any opinions. I posted facts and math. I have no \"opinion\" on the Bakken formation. I just have a calculator and an ability to read factual reports on the thing. \n \n If relying on cold, hard, mathematically verifiable facts is the \"EPA/liberal\" view, then sign me up. Funny, but in the past the conservatives were typically considered the analytical thinkers...the guys who did the math. \n\n \n Who typically considered conservatives like that? Is there a definition of conservatism anywhere on the net you can link me to that defines comservatism as being mainly about analytical thinking and math? Conservatism is about liberty, limited government, traditional morality, and free markets. \n \n \nSo, dont pretend you are putting forth some kind of valid argument here. The numbers in your Email are absolutely and without question WRONG. They have been shown to be absolutely and without question WRONG. There is no argument or opinion there. If you want to continue relying on that Email as a feel good crutch, go ahead, but dont pretend that it is anything but that. \n\n \n There have been erroneous reports of just how much oil there is, and where it is, for almost 100 years. No one knows for sure just how much is there, or how future technology and economic conditions will affect its recovery. Of course there are special interests who don't want it to be there, so of course there will be reports that it is not. Free markets should determine what the truth is, not special interests, like the EPA, or amateur mom and pop websites like snopes. \n \n \nAnd they damn well should have. Teh Bush administration should never have issued the permits. Do you know what they were planning to do, Marc? They intended to literally dump over 100 million cubic yard of high selenium coal mining waste direct5ly into streams. You do realize that a lot of coal mining waste is radioactive, right? And these were streams that literally feed directly into town and city water supplies. \n\n \n What far left website did you c/p that from? Conservatives believe that coal mining companies know more about coal mining than does the government. (limited government and free markets) Would that coal mining company have poisoned town and city water supplies worse than the EPA mandated gasoline additive MTBE? \n \n \nThe MTBE issue is not the only case of inappropriate action by EPA. The nonpartisan General Accounting Office and the Congressional Research Service have been severely critical of EPA's policies and behavior regarding secondhand smoke and a variety of other issues. EPA has been guilty of violating its own risk assessment guidelines. It has been found guilty of violating six federal statutes for using harassment and intimidation to try to compel employee support for its policy on secondhand smoke. It has fraudulently misrepresented the findings of other scientists in order to make it appear they supported conclusions EPA favored. A dozen career employees of EPA wrote a letter to the Washington Times \"risking our careers rather than choosing to remain silent\" about \"egregious misconduct\" at EPA. Internal documents available under the Freedom of Information Act show that EPA exaggerated claims and promulgated unwarranted policies. EPA has gone against the advice of it own Science Advisory Board (see, for example, its history of action on particulates.) EPA fraudulently manufactured fake \"scientific\" studies in order to support its views on sulfur dioxide (see my book MAKERS AND TAKERS for fuller explanation of this.) EPA has funneled taxpayer money to lobby groups that support political action on policies-even unscientific ones-that EPA wants to promote (for example, a million dollars a year to the American Cancer Society). EPA should be a scientific agency, not one that funds political activism. \n\n \n Ethanol and MTBE - Should EPA be Abolished?\n \n You trust the EPA, I trust the coal mining companies. Do coal mining companies make honest mistakes? Of course. Does the EPA make honest mistakes? Since it's a special interest, does it make dishonest ones? It's documented that it does. Is it accountable for them? \n \n \nIt is absolutely ridiculous that those permits were ever issued. This is not a case where we are stopping progress because some fish that nobody has ever heard of would suffer. This is literally case where tens of thousands of people would have been been exposed to toxic levels of selenium. \n\n \n \"Would have been\" - the voice of big government. \n \n \nSorry, Marc, but if you cant support pulling that permit given those facts, you are just plain evil. \n\n \n \"Evil corporations\", \"evil free markets\". \n \n \nIf you are a conservative, then the liberals have got all the facts on their side. I do not support Obama, and sure as hell do not support his fiscal policies. \n\n \n He's been president for two full years now. Any links to anywhere on this site where you have bashed Obama even once, to the extent that you have Bush, during and well after his presidency? \n \n \nI support raising taxes because I love my country and it is an absolute, unquestionable, mathematical fact that the United States of America will FAIL as a nation if we do not. NO MORE USA. That is not even debatable, that is simple math.\n \n Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the federal reserve, literally got up in front of the US congress and told them that the first thing he does every morning, before he even gets dressed, is check the price of US Treasuries to make sure the US did not fail while he was sleeping.\n \n For the last 15 years EVERY SINGLE report that the joint chiefs have sent to congress has identified our lack of national infrastructure and our DEBT as the biggest threat to America. Not terrorists. Not a nuclear armed Iran or N Korea, but our own spending habits. \n\n \n Spending habits, yes. Spending money on monstrous bureaucracies like the EPA to shut down production in West Virginia, and oppose new oil exploration at every opportunity. \n \n \nAND YET, we have STUPID, LAZY, IGNORANT, GREEDY people who are not only unwilling to see taxes raised to SAVE OUR COUNTRY, they are so GREEDY that they demand that taxes be LOWERED so they can keep more. \n\n \n It's one of the oldest political arguments in the US. Conservatives believe that keeping taxes low encourages free markets, job creation, and a strong economy. Liberals believe raising taxes so the government can redistribute wealth will strengthen the economy, and one of these days it's going to work! \n \n \nWhat kind of person are you, Marc? \n\n \n A conservative. emoticon_xangel Someone who knows that tax collecting governments are run by politicians, not businessmen. Politicians make political decisions, not economic ones. Current U.S. economic conditions exist because of that. Doing more of the same will not solve the problems, it will only make them worse. \n \n \n \n \n Sometimes you seem like decent kind of guy.\n\n \n Only sometimes? emoticon_cry\n \n \nHave you ever been to a third world country? Have you ever been somewhere that the government has collapsed? That is LITERALLY what you are advocating leaving to your children and grandchildren when you oppose taking the steps we need to take to to address our economic problems.\n\n Is it okay with you that many teachers, policemen and firemen retire at, or even before age 50, with nice fat taxpayer supported pensions? I can't quickly find a figure that represents the yearly amount that the U.S. government needs just to run itself, seems like I remember seeing the figure of $1.3 trillion a year or two ago. A fourth or a third of the entire budget. I did find figures that cover a few basics close to Washington however;\n \n \n \nThe running of the Senate $869.3 million - mainly for the personnel and office expenses of individual Senators; and the salaries of officers and their employees.\n \n House of Representatives - as for the Senate, but these costs amount to $1.2 billion\n \n Architect of the Capitol - the costs of the maintenance, operation, development and preservation of the Capitol complex (which includes not only the main Capitol building but House & Senate Offices; the grounds; the buildings and grounds of the Library of Congress; Capitol power plant; Botanic Garden and the new Capitol Visitors Center are estimated at $481.7 million\n \n Capitol Police - This department will the full time equivalent of 2,125 people. Staff and other costs will require $299.1 million.\n \n Support agencies, which provide information and carry out key work for the Congress are asking for the following: -\n \n Congressional Budget Office: $37.97 million\n \n Library of Congress $661.6 million\n \n (including $108.7 million for the Congressional Research Service)\n \n Government Accountability Office $523.8 million\n \n Government Printing Office $181.98 million\n \n Office of Compliance $ 4.1 million\n \n Open World Leadership Center $14.4 million\n \n John B Stennis Center for Public Service Training & Development $430,000 \n\n \n I'm not the only decent kind of guy who can think of something besides raising taxes to do something about spending problems.\n \n ____________________________\n \n \nThe problem is the partisanship in this country. Some people just cant seem to get their head around the fact that I, for example, have a deep and abiding hatred of both Bush Jr and Obama. \n\n \n So you bash them at about a 500 to 1 ratio?\n \n \nI feel compelled to listen to what BOTH parties have to say before I decide which is the \"good\" one and which is the \"bad\" one on any issue, and I generally operate on the principal that BOTH parties are evil and looking to screw us. Overall, there is no \"good\" side and there is no \"bad\" side. Both parties suck sweaty monkey nuts. They are both staffed by, and controlled by, elitist scum that is more than happy to throw the rest of us under the bus so they can make another billion. \n\n \n They ARE largely the same, because they have the same constituents. \n \n \nWhen we are assigning \"liberal\" and \"conservative\" views to freaking geological surveys, things have gone too far. \n\n \n \"Liberal\" and \"conservative\" are assigned to ANYTHING the government is involved with. The U.S. government has been heavily involved in geology for a long time. \n \n \nIf being a good party member means blindly following whatever garbage your parties leadership throws out, then it is not possible to be a good party member and a good American. If you are a good American, when a bunch of politicians stand up and say \"We are going to solve the national debt problem by defunding NPR\" it is your DUTY as an american to jump up an yell \"BULLDROPPINGS\" no matter WHICH party they represent. \n\n \n So you'd keep NPR and raise taxes? What does NPR accomplish? \n \n \nI am losing my usually sunny \"the glass is half full\" disposition the more I look into the economic state of this country. \n\n \n Hahaha, \"usually sunny\"???? You've been predicting doom and gloom on these forums for the better part of a decade. \n \n _____________________________\n \n \nHonestly, we have too many people like our friends Easy and Marc who call themselves fiscal conservatives but are really just fans of the republican team. \n\n \n Where have I called myself a \"fiscal\" conservative? Conservatism doesn't begin and end with finances. And every proposed solution to financial problems isn't automatically conservative. Raising taxes is one of them. \n \n I don't always agree with everything the Republicans do, but I ALWAYS disagree with everything the Democrats do. When Republicans do something I don't like, the alternative is ALWAYS the Democrats doing something that is far worse. It wasn't always that way, there were some good Democrats in the past. Southern Democrats, Wendell Ford, Zell Miller, many others. Those days are gone, the Democrat party has changed. NOTHING they do is conservative, raising taxes is NEVER conservative.",

Raise the gas tax, raise the tax on food, anything to increase the revenues they gave away with Massive tax cuts.

The free market cannot \"determine\" how much oil is there. The amount of oil there is the amount of oil there. The market does not determine it, seismic imaging does. They do a seismic survey of the entire regions and then it is pretty much just a matter of using the volume calculation function on their software, Marc. Read the actual report. THERE IS NO DEBATE. For all intents and purposes, we have SEEN the oil and COUNTED it. They look at the reservoir, see how big it is, and then figure out how much oil would fit in there. You are essentially arguing that maybe you CAN put 2 gallons of water in a 2 quart pitcher if you believe hard enough and the free market says you can. Try that in your kitchen, Marc. Warn your wife, though, because she is going to want to have some towels on hand. \n \n \n \n \nWhat far left website did you c/p that from? Conservatives believe that coal mining companies know more about coal mining than does the government. (limited government and free markets) Would that coal mining company have poisoned town and city water supplies worse than the EPA mandated gasoline additive MTBE? \n\n \n No, they dont. The numbers I used came from the environmental impact report that the COAL COMPANY did. This is not a case where there were differing opinions. The company did not argue that the government was wrong about the environmental impact. They just didnt care. IT is not a question of who knows more about coal mining. The coal companies JOB is to dig coal and make money. Their job does not include caring about the environmental impact or the people downstream.\n \n Any YES, it would have been MUCH worse the the MTBE fiasco. MUCH WORSE. \n \n \n \n \nEthanol and MTBE - Should EPA be Abolished?\n \n You trust the EPA, I trust the coal mining companies. Do coal mining companies make honest mistakes? Of course. Does the EPA make honest mistakes? Since it's a special interest, does it make dishonest ones? It's documented that it does. Is it accountable for them? \n\n \n I trust the coal company, too. I trust that they will do everything in their power to produce coal and make a profit. Their job is not to care about the environment unless there are laws that require that they do so. Frankly for you to believe otherwise makes you a fool. \n \n Again, there was NO DEBATE about what the environmental impact was going to be. The EPA did not challenge the numbers the company gave. The company was very open about the fact that they planned to dump 100 million yards of material directly into waterways. They were very open about the fact that there was going to be a selenium toxicity problem. They just didnt care. It is not their job to care. \n \n \n\"Evil corporations\", \"evil free markets\". \n\n \n No, I called YOU evil. Corporations are profit driven, and that is how it should be. They are amoral. Markets are the same and are amoral. What would be immoral would be a corporation that did NOT seek profits. It is up to society, usually through government, to impose morals on entities that are by definition amoral. A corporation cannot be evil. You can be, and apparently are. \n \n \nHe's been president for two full years now. Any links to anywhere on this site where you have bashed Obama even once, to the extent that you have Bush, during and well after his presidency? \n\n \n Search for Obama under my user name. I am not sure I have ever said anything nice about the guy. If I have, I assure you it was an accident. \n \n \nSpending habits, yes. Spending money on monstrous bureaucracies like the EPA to shut down production in West Virginia, and oppose new oil exploration at every opportunity. \n\n \n Oppose new oil exploration at every opportunity? PLEASE tell me you are not one of those fools who thinks that we are sitting on an ocean of oil if the darn tree huggers would just let us develop it?? Look at the facts, Marc. Over 3/4 of federal drilling leases are INACTIVE. The companies have not even gotten around to preliminary exploration on them. For a decade now various members of congress have been pushing for a \"use it or lose it\" rule when it comes to federal oil leases because the majors snap up all the oil leases and then just sit on them. \n \n \n\n \n It's one of the oldest political arguments in the US. Conservatives believe that keeping taxes low encourages free markets, job creation, and a strong economy. Liberals believe raising taxes so the government can redistribute wealth will strengthen the economy, and one of these days it's going to work! \n\n \n No, that argument is not that old. It was Reagan who made that a part of \"conservative\" lore, despite the fact that his own bundget director tried to explain to him that he was mis-applying the theory. \n \n The truth is that FOOLS believe what you post above. We know for an absolute fact that it is NOT TRUE. There is not even any question about its potential truth. While there IS certainly a point where taxation will impact the economy and result in economic contraction, the closest that economists have been able to come to pinning down that point puts it somewhere around an 80% tax rate. \n \n Typically conservatives also believe in the capitalist economic model. Do you? If so, how do you reconcile that with what we have now? In a capitalist economy the majority of money must be spread through the middle class. In ours it is not, it is concentrated in the top 1%. By definition this is not a capitalist economy. Do you not believe in capitalism?\n \n \n \nA conservative. emoticon_xangel Someone who knows that tax collecting governments are run by politicians, not businessmen. Politicians make political decisions, not economic ones. Current U.S. economic conditions exist because of that. Doing more of the same will not solve the problems, it will only make them worse. \n\n \n Apparently you are an evil, amoral person who does not believe in paying your bills. The idea that we can handle our deficit and debt without raising taxes, and doing so significantly, is mathematically impossible. Get it out of your head. It CANNOT BE DONE. Even if we cut government spending to zero, we would STILL have to increase taxes to cover our debt. \n \n \n \nIs it okay with you that many teachers, policemen and firemen retire at, or even before age 50, with nice fat taxpayer supported pensions? I can't quickly find a figure that represents the yearly amount that the U.S. government needs just to run itself, seems like I remember seeing the figure of $1.3 trillion a year or two ago. A fourth or a third of the entire budget. I did find figures that cover a few basics close to Washington however;\n \n\n \n No, it is not ok with me. That is why I have advocated MASSIVE spending cuts. I have advocated cutting the federal budget by 50% or more across the board. The fact remains that even such massive spending cuts will NOT solve the problem. We HAVE TO increase taxes. There is no other option. There can be no half measures. \n \n \n \nI'm not the only decent kind of guy who can think of something besides raising taxes to do something about spending problems.\n\n \n And we should cut most of those. HOWEVER, that still leaves us with a HUGE pile of debt that has to be dealt with and will require raising taxes. \n \n \nSo you bash them at about a 500 to 1 ratio?\n\n \n BS, Marc. \n \n \n \n \n\"Liberal\" and \"conservative\" are assigned to ANYTHING the government is involved with. The U.S. government has been heavily involved in geology for a long time. \n\n \n This is just ignorant. The government has been involved in math for a long time. The fact that 2+2=4 carries neither a liberal nor a conservative bias. This is just plain stoopid. \n \n \n \nSo you'd keep NPR and raise taxes? What does NPR accomplish? \n\n \n No, I would get rid of NPR and still raise taxes. That was Powells point. Going through and eliminating silly little programs like NPR does not address the problem. Yep...stole that \"NPR\" thing from Colin Powell. Are we going to start pretending he is not a hard core conservative??\n \n \n \nHahaha, \"usually sunny\"???? You've been predicting doom and gloom on these forums for the better part of a decade. \n\n \n I call them like I see them, Marc, and if you go back and look, I have been shockingly accurate in my predictions. That is because I am not driven by ignorant political partisanship. I am driven by logic. That is what used to make a conservative. Conservatives were realistic, liberals were idealistic, and somewhere in between the US was a pretty good place to live and raise a family. Today, liberals have not really changed. They are still a bunch of idealistic poofs. Conservatives, though, seem to have moved from the \"realist\" realm to the \"mentally retarded\" realm. \n \n The conservative party is essentially dead. It has been replaced by the neocons, which is essentially another idealistic party but for those of a right leaning persuasion. Traditional conservatives, the realists who did the math and kept the liberals from spending us into the poorhouse have been marginalized so now both the liberals and the neocons are doing their best to spend us into the poor house. \n \n We have XXXXXX assigning \"liberal\" and \"conservative\" labels to geology and physics. We have right wing XXXXXX advocating for tax cuts to stimulate the economy and bring down government debt despite the fact that it has been shown mathematically that their position is nonsense. \n \n The neocons are the party of the ignorant. It is the party for those who are incapable of any kind of complex thought. If you think that spending more money on our military than the rest of the world combined provides security, but do not see the security implications in the fact that the chinese could destroy our nation, literally cause our nation to fail, by pushing a \"sell\" button and dumping their US bond holdings on the market, the neocons are happy to have you. If you are not bright enough to understand that having to buy all our advanced missile guidance chips from Taiwan and Korea because we lack the infrastructure to build them ourselves is a security concern, you will be at home with the neocons.\n \n The truth is that the Republican party has in large part become the party of the stupid and the simpletons. \n \n \n The truth is that our economy is shockingly simple to call if you have an analytical mind and a calculator. When the housing market crashed, I was not surprised. I had been arguing right here on this forum that it WOULD crash for nearly 8 months.

Bush did raise taxes but not because he or the conservative party wanted to. Once he negotiated the deal with the Democrats ( who refused to pass his Budget Without tax increases) he did include some small increases in his budget proposal.

   "Fiscal responsibility, limited government, and the concept of free enterprise are all analytical concepts Marc. \n\n \n Not according to Democrats. They consider analytical thinking as soaking the rich, absolute submission to the EPA, and calling more and more government spending as \"investing\". \n \n \nThis is just plain DUMB. The free market cannot \"determine\" how much oil is there. The amount of oil there is the amount of oil there. The market does not determine it, seismic imaging does. They do a seismic survey of the entire regions and then it is pretty much just a matter of using the volume calculation function on their software, Marc. Read the actual report. THERE IS NO DEBATE. For all intents and purposes, we have SEEN the oil and COUNTED it. They look at the reservoir, see how big it is, and then figure out how much oil would fit in there. You are essentially arguing that maybe you CAN put 2 gallons of water in a 2 quart pitcher if you believe hard enough and the free market says you can. Try that in your kitchen, Marc. Warn your wife, though, because she is going to want to have some towels on hand. \n\n \n \nPredictions of imminent catastrophic depletion are almost as old as the oil industry. An 1855 advertisement for Kier's Rock Oil, a patent medicine whose key ingredient was petroleum bubbling up from salt wells near Pittsburgh, urged customers to buy soon before \"this wonderful product is depleted from Nature's laboratory.\" The ad appeared four years before Pennsylvania's first oil well was drilled. In 1919 David White of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) predicted that world oil production would peak in nine years. And in 1943 the Standard Oil geologist Wallace Pratt calculated that the world would ultimately produce 600 billion barrels of oil. (In fact, more than 1 trillion barrels of oil had been pumped by 2006.)\n \n During the 1970s, the Club of Rome report The Limits to Growth projected that, assuming consumption remained flat, all known oil reserves would be entirely consumed in just 31 years. With exponential growth in consumption, it added, all the known oil reserves would be consumed in 20 years. These dour predictions gained credibility when the Arab oil crisis of 1973 quadrupled prices from $3 to $12 per barrel (from $16 to $48 in 2006 dollars) and when the Iranian oil crisis more than doubled oil prices from $14 per barrel in 1978 to $35 per barrel by 1981 (from $45 to $98 in 2006 dollars). \n\n \n Past Predictions on When Oil Would Run Out\n \n You're very confident in todays technology in determining exactly how much oil is underground. Just like all the above people were of the technology of their day. \n \n \nNo, they dont. The numbers I used came from the environmental impact report that the COAL COMPANY did. This is not a case where there were differing opinions. The company did not argue that the government was wrong about the environmental impact. They just didnt care. IT is not a question of who knows more about coal mining. The coal companies JOB is to dig coal and make money. Their job does not include caring about the environmental impact or the people downstream. \n\n \n Their job includes avoiding lawsuits. Your cynicism towards the intents of business is to the left of Charles Schumer. There is more to business than greed. Just because you have no conception of \"pride in your work\" doesn't mean it doesn't exist. \n \n \nAny YES, it would have been MUCH worse the the MTBE fiasco. MUCH WORSE. \n\n \n Conservative source? \n \n \nI trust the coal company, too. I trust that they will do everything in their power to produce coal and make a profit. Their job is not to care about the environment unless there are laws that require that they do so. Frankly for you to believe otherwise makes you a fool. \n\n \n Like Democrat party leaders, (and followers), you have little concept of how liberty and free markets actually work. \n \n \nAgain, there was NO DEBATE about what the environmental impact was going to be. The EPA did not challenge the numbers the company gave. The company was very open about the fact that they planned to dump 100 million yards of material directly into waterways. They were very open about the fact that there was going to be a selenium toxicity problem. They just didnt care. It is not their job to care. \n\n \n But the EPA cares, right? The EPA is never to be questioned, right? The EPA is blessed with human compassion that no cold, calculating business owner could never possess, right? emoticon_rolleyes In free markets, businesses are accountable for their actions. Government bureaucracies are usually not accountable. \n \n \nNo, I called YOU evil. Corporations are profit driven, and that is how it should be. They are amoral. Markets are the same and are amoral. What would be immoral would be a corporation that did NOT seek profits. It is up to society, usually through government, to impose morals on entities that are by definition amoral. \n \n \n No, usually through FREE MARKETS. Did you know that 'greed' and 'profits' are not the same? Or that liberals intentionally confuse those two terms, in the interest of increasing the size and scope of government? \n \n \nA corporation cannot be evil. You can be, and apparently are. \n\n \n You have accused them of intending to dump 100 million yards of poisons into a waterway leading to cities and towns, and you don't' call that evil? \n \n \nSearch for Obama under my user name. I am not sure I have ever said anything nice about the guy. If I have, I assure you it was an accident. \n\n \n Must have been an accident when you sprang to his defense in post #31 of this thread. \n \n \nOppose new oil exploration at every opportunity? PLEASE tell me you are not one of those fools who thinks that we are sitting on an ocean of oil if the darn tree huggers would just let us develop it?? Look at the facts, Marc. \n\n \n Like the fact that Obama emotionally shut down drilling in the gulf for 6 months to get even with the evil BP oil company? \n \n \nOver 3/4 of federal drilling leases are INACTIVE. The companies have not even gotten around to preliminary exploration on them. For a decade now various members of congress have been pushing for a \"use it or lose it\" rule when it comes to federal oil leases because the majors snap up all the oil leases and then just sit on them. \n\n \n Because they can't profitably deal with the EPA. Just like Obama said a year or two ago, (paraphrase) \"Sure, you can build a coal plant if you want, but we'll bankrupt you yuk yuk. \n \n \nNo, that argument is not that old. It was Reagan who made that a part of \"conservative\" lore, despite the fact that his own bundget director tried to explain to him that he was mis-applying the theory. \n\n \n It is old, that basic debate has been going on for generations. FDR was an example of a liberal, Eisenhower was conservative. Nixon (small government) ran against Kennedy (bigger government) in 1960. It's actually been going on throughout American history. \n \n \nThe truth is that FOOLS believe what you post above. We know for an absolute fact that it is NOT TRUE. There is not even any question about its potential truth. While there IS certainly a point where taxation will impact the economy and result in economic contraction, the closest that economists have been able to come to pinning down that point puts it somewhere around an 80% tax rate. \n \n Typically conservatives also believe in the capitalist economic model. Do you? If so, how do you reconcile that with what we have now? In a capitalist economy the majority of money must be spread through the middle class. In ours it is not, it is concentrated in the top 1%. By definition this is not a capitalist economy. Do you not believe in capitalism? \n\n \n The U.S government is currently too big for capitalism to work properly. Smaller business/the middle class is burdened by licensing and regulation that most of the rest of the world isn't. \n \n \nApparently you are an evil, amoral person who does not believe in paying your bills. The idea that we can handle our deficit and debt without raising taxes, and doing so significantly, is mathematically impossible. Get it out of your head. It CANNOT BE DONE. Even if we cut government spending to zero, we would STILL have to increase taxes to cover our debt. \n\n \n How about if we didn't cut government spending at all, and just taxed the rich more. (which is probably what's going to happen) Would that \" cover our debt\"? If not, then why do it at all? \n \n \nNo, it is not ok with me. That is why I have advocated MASSIVE spending cuts. I have advocated cutting the federal budget by 50% or more across the board. The fact remains that even such massive spending cuts will NOT solve the problem. We HAVE TO increase taxes. There is no other option. There can be no half measures. \n\n \n It would be a half measure if we increased taxes, and didn't cut the federal budget by 50% or more. And you know that's how it would be. Taxes can be raised on the rich without an eruption of social violence. Cutting the federal budget couldn't happen without unrest similar to what's going on in Egypt right now. \n \n \nThis is just ignorant. The government has been involved in math for a long time. The fact that 2+2=4 carries neither a liberal nor a conservative bias. This is just plain stoopid. \n\n \n The words liberal and conservative apply to math too, when the government is cooking the books and playing word games. . When a \"surplus\" is declared, because a budget deficit is only half of the original projection, for example. The reason the American people seem stupid to you concerning math is because they have little patience with numbers games. Accountants don't seem to have an interest in presenting numbers in a simple, understandable way. You and Steeeeve didn't say a thing about the numbers I showed in post #66, about the $1.2 billion to run the House of Representatives, or the $661.6 million for the \"Library of Congress\", (as only two examples) What were these figures in 1995? 1985? 1975? 1965? If comparisons like this were shown for all government spending of the past, it wouldn't be hard to see where U.S. financial problems are. And corrective measures wouldn't be taxing the rich more. \n \n \nNo, I would get rid of NPR and still raise taxes. That was Powells point. Going through and eliminating silly little programs like NPR does not address the problem. Yep...stole that \"NPR\" thing from Colin Powell. Are we going to start pretending he is not a hard core conservative?? \n\n \n Colin Powell is a fence sitting flip flopper, like a lot of politicians and forum posters I've seen. \n \n \nI call them like I see them, Marc, and if you go back and look, I have been shockingly accurate in my predictions. That is because I am not driven by ignorant political partisanship. I am driven by logic. \n\n \n Every Republican and every Democrat believes their position is logical. So does every third-world dictator. Your opinion is no more special than anyone else's. You can do all the math and financial calculations you want, but you can't predict the future and future human behavior any better than anyone else. \n \n \nThat is what used to make a conservative. Conservatives were realistic, liberals were idealistic, and somewhere in between the US was a pretty good place to live and raise a family. Today, liberals have not really changed. \n\n \n Liberals have changed a LOT. JFK was a liberal in the 1960's. There was no imperial EPA in the 1960's, there were no claims that healthcare was an automatic right for U.S. citizens. Just two examples of many. \n \n \n They are still a bunch of idealistic poofs. Conservatives, though, seem to have moved from the \"realist\" realm to the \"mentally retarded\" realm. \n \n The conservative party is essentially dead. It has been replaced by the neocons, which is essentially another idealistic party but for those of a right leaning persuasion. Traditional conservatives, the realists who did the math and kept the liberals from spending us into the poorhouse have been marginalized so now both the liberals and the neocons are doing their best to spend us into the poor house. \n\n \n Traditional morals have declined in the U.S. Past traditional conservatives have compromised (\"maybe healthcare IS a right\", \"maybe there is no difference in greed and profit and we really do need the EPA to protects us from these ruthless corporations\", \"maybe filth and porn on the net are an okay way to protect free speech\", on and on) The ones who haven't compromised are the ones you call the neocons, the Beck's, the Palin's, the tea party movement. The only actual conservatives left. \n \n \nWe have XXXXXX assigning \"liberal\" and \"conservative\" labels to geology and physics. We have right wing XXXXXX advocating for tax cuts to stimulate the economy and bring down government debt despite the fact that it has been shown mathematically that their position is nonsense. \n \n The neocons are the party of the ignorant. It is the party for those who are incapable of any kind of complex thought. If you think that spending more money on our military than the rest of the world combined provides security, but do not see the security implications in the fact that the chinese could destroy our nation, literally cause our nation to fail, by pushing a \"sell\" button and dumping their US bond holdings on the market, the neocons are happy to have you. \n\n \n And the liberals are happy to have you if you think that the Chinese are avoiding pushing the sell button because they feel sorry for us. They don't push that button because it's not in their own best interests to push it. \n \n \nIf you are not bright enough to understand that having to buy all our advanced missile guidance chips from Taiwan and Korea because we lack the infrastructure to build them ourselves is a security concern, you will be at home with the neocons. \n\n \n We don't lack the infrastructure, we lack the LIBERTY. \n \n \nThe truth is that the Republican party has in large part become the party of the stupid and the simpletons. \n\n \n And your assessment of the Democrats? [crickets chirping] \n \n \nThe truth is that our economy is shockingly simple to call if you have an analytical mind and a calculator. When the housing market crashed, I was not surprised. I had been arguing right here on this forum that it WOULD crash for nearly 8 months. I even gave a timeline of events that would lead to the crash and hit every major point. There were no surprises there. Likewise when the IEA admitted that we have probably passed peak oil, I was not surprised. We had discussed that here as well. I did the math. There were no surprises there.\n \n What we are lacking now, Marc, that darkens my outlook, is an up side. Regardless of what you may have thought you read, I was not spreading doom and gloom. I was pointing out opportunity. When the housing and CDO mess hit, I was heavily short on Citibank (a transaction I discussed here). Did just fine. When housing prices hit bottom (and they are nowhere close yet), there may be another opportunity there. \n \n Peak oil? Another opportunity\n\n \n \n You're describing \"opportunity\" not for the entire society, but only for a few, often at the expense of the rest of society. Ever hear of the website \"Endofamerica.com\"? Or Endofamerica15.com? Or EndofAmerica29.com? Or Endofamerica34.com? They all go to the same place, the numbers are there only for him to analyze exactly where the biggest sucker markets are. It's advertised as free advise on how to protect yourself when the big crash comes. And after sitting through about 45 minutes of dire predictions about how the U.S. dollar is about to become completely useless, no free advise is given! You have to send him 50 useless dollars to find that out! Then while he's telling you what to do to protect yourself, he'll also tell you how to take advantage of the situation, and make some big bucks at everyone else's expense. He's probably found 100,000 suckers from my area alone, considering his advertising binge. That's a cool $5 million for him. He knows how it's done allright. The erosion of morality in the U.S. is largely what has caused so many flim flam men to flourish. It contributes to U.S financial problems just as much as anything else. \n \n \nComplete failure of the US? Not a lot of opportunity there. That pretty much screws us all.\n \n The problem, Marc, is that a complete and utter failure of the US is heading from the \"likely\" category to the \"inevitable\" column because of the idiotic actions of our politicians and the overly simplistic and ignorant views of the people who elected them. There is no up side to that for anybody in the US, and I am not leaving. \n \n At that point, opportunity goes out the window. Without opportunity, my sunny disposition starts to darken.\n\n \n You call it \"Shockingly simple\", and call the electorate's view of it \"overly simplistic\". Why are you right and the electorate wrong?",

A Government shut down at this point would do way more harm than raising the Debt Ceiling. Police and Firemen Jobs are not in Jeopardy because I believe most of those are State Governments and not Federal. We would have No Mail service, and most devastating would be the Millions of People on Social Security and Medicare that would not receive benefits. The most worrisome for me is the Power shift that would happen if they say no. If faced with Defaulting on the National Debt the Treasurer has the power to do pretty much what he needs to do to pay that debt, and with him being an Obama appointment That would basically shift the Power to Obama. Congress is in a Lose Lose situation and they know it, but IMO if they do the right thing and raise the ceiling now I think the voters will forgive them for breaking a Promise.

A company, ANY COMPANIES board of directors have a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders and their shareholders profits. That is a matter of law. For the board of directors of that mining company to fore go billions in profits to avoid polluting water would actually be illegal. \n \n \nLike Democrat party leaders, (and followers), you have little concept of how liberty and free markets actually work. \n\n \n Explain where I am off, Marc. Coal company sees billions in profits, coal company goes after those profits. It is that simple. Now, I know that in theory if the customers did not like how that coal is produced they woudl not buy it, thus punishing coal companies who were irresponsible. In the real world, Coal is a market traded commodity, so production and end use are completely isolated from each other (as anybody who knows anything about fee markets would know). \n \n \nBut the EPA cares, right? The EPA is never to be questioned, right? The EPA is blessed with human compassion that no cold, calculating business owner could never possess, right? emoticon_rolleyes In free markets, businesses are accountable for their actions. Government bureaucracies are usually not accountable. \n\n \n No, the EPA does not care, but just like the executives in that coal company have a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders which typically prevents them from interjecting person morals into the decisions they make, the EPA legally has a fiduciary responsibility to protect the health and well being of the american public when it comes to environmental contaminates. They dont have to care about the american public. They are just legally bound to protect them. \n \n I suppose you are working from the assumption that those injured by the companies activities would sue??? That is not \"free market\", that is using the same government framework you are opposed to in order to punish the company. And you know what that lawsuit would be, Marc? They would have to sue under the clean water protection act.....the same act that the EPA is unquestionably upholding in denying their permit. \n \n So, your argument is that we should have to wait until thousands of miles of streams and rivers are transformed into lifeless cess pools, and wait until tens of thousands of people are ill from selenium poisoning before we tell people they are not allowed to dump toxic amounts of selenium into peoples drinking water?\n \n Again. Just plain dumb. \n \n \nNo, usually through FREE MARKETS. Did you know that 'greed' and 'profits' are not the same? Or that liberals intentionally confuse those two terms, in the interest of increasing the size and scope of government? \n\n \n Wrong. Corporations are amoral. They always have been, they always will be. Their officers are legally required to be. \n \n You simply have no idea what you are talking about, Marc. \n \n \nYou have accused them of intending to dump 100 million yards of poisons into a waterway leading to cities and towns, and you don't' call that evil? \n\n \n No. I don't. They are chasing profits. That is the only reason they exist. \n \n \n\n Must have been an accident when you sprang to his defense in post #31 of this thread. \n\n \n No, I didnt. I asked him to list some of Obamas programs that he felt were bankrupting America. Then I advocated electing a bunch of \"old school\" conservatives (read that...traditional conservatives). \n \n \n \nLike the fact that Obama emotionally shut down drilling in the gulf for 6 months to get even with the evil BP oil company? \n\n \n This is just plain retarded. He shut down drilling in the gulf to give federal regulators a chance to figure out exactly what went wrong there that cost 11 people their lives and caused the worst oil spill in US history. \n \n Until the deepwater horizon incident, it was pretty much settled lore in the oil drilling industry that a blow out preventer was the be all end all of safety. They did not think they COULD fail. Then one did and it caught them flat footed. \n \n \nBecause they can't profitably deal with the EPA. Just like Obama said a year or two ago, (paraphrase) \"Sure, you can build a coal plant if you want, but we'll bankrupt you yuk yuk. \n\n \n Where do you come up with this BS marc? Do you actually KNOW anything about the mining industry or the oil industry? Anything at all, or are you just repeating completely retarded talking points? \n \n On the drilling side there is virtually no EPA to worry about. You file an intent to drill memorandum with the EPA and whoever your local state regulator (here in KS is it the Kansas corporate commission). If the EPA is concerned about aspects of your drilling activities, they will ask you to provide further analysis. I have never gotten such a request. Nobody I have ever known who holds oil leases had ever gotten such a request. Nobody I know in the oilfield service business has ever had a client who got such a request. Those requests come with less than 1% of drilling operations. Typically when the EPA DOES require more information from somebody on a drilling project it is because they are trying something new or because they are drilling close enough to an aquifer to be concerned about cross contamination.\n \n On the refining side, there is a lot more regulation. Here is a chart showing actual environmental compliance cost:\n \n http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/perfpro/ref_pi/t1.gif\n \n http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/perfpro/ref_pi/t1.gif\n \n That is not looking real severe to me, Marc. Do the math on it. They are probably spending about as much on compliance as they are on bottled water. \n \n On the mining side you have to do something REALLY stupid to get the EPA involved. I filed 2 dozen briefs for new mining sites this year. Each is about 3 pages long. They are INCREDIBLY flexible about pretty much everything. Unless you are planning to do something outrageous like, oh, dumping 100 million yards of coal mine waste directly into streams, they are typically fine with it. \n \n \nIt is old, that basic debate has been going on for generations. FDR was an example of a liberal, Eisenhower was conservative. Nixon (small government) ran against Kennedy (bigger government) in 1960. It's actually been going on throughout American history. \n\n \n Wrong. First of all, nice trying to hide this as a \"big gov vs small gov\" argument. It is not. We are talking about paying the government debt that we have already accrued here. \n \n \n \nThe U.S government is currently too big for capitalism to work properly. Smaller business/the middle class is burdened by licensing and regulation that most of the rest of the world isn't. \n \n\n \n ROTFLMAO. Can you give me some examples of that, Marc? Do you really thin that the middle class in the US spends a lot of time pulling licenses and worrying about government regulation? You dont even seem to know which government regulations we are actually spending money on (hint, over 95% of government compliance costs in this country are for department of LABOR compliance....OSHA, MSHA, worker safety...leaving less than 5% for all other government compliance COMBINED). \n \n \n \n How about if we didn't cut government spending at all, and just taxed the rich more. (which is probably what's going to happen) Would that \" cover our debt\"? If not, then why do it at all? \n\n \n If we taxed the wealthy at 95% then yes, it would do it. That does not seem real fair to me though, marc. Of course, if we taxed the wealthy at 95% on average they would STILL have 6x more income than your average middle class american. Still does not seem fair. \n \n No...we need to cut spending heavily and raise taxes. I cannot support a tax hike large enough to solve the problem without the spending cuts. \n \n \n \nIt would be a half measure if we increased taxes, and didn't cut the federal budget by 50% or more. And you know that's how it would be. Taxes can be raised on the rich without an eruption of social violence. Cutting the federal budget couldn't happen without unrest similar to what's going on in Egypt right now.\n \n \n What is going on in egypt right now is the result of 20+ years of a US puppet ruler putting foreign interests before the interests of his own people. \n \n This is what you are missing, Marc. One way or another, those cuts WILL occur. There is no question and we have no choice. Either we will make the cuts voluntarily and be able to maintain some semblance of order, or the bond markets will make them for us and the nation fails. Either way, the cuts will be made. \n \n I am sure you heard about the \"european debt crisis\"? First, the european debt crisis did not actually exist. The problem was that Eurozone nations cannot just fire up the printing presses and print their way out of fiscal trouble. They ended up needing a bailout. Other euro nations provided the bailout on the understanding that the nations in question must get their fiscal houses in order. \n \n Our bond investors are doing the same to us right now, Marc. Our federal reserve is directly monetizing the debt (buying open market bonds in the same amount as new issuance) in order to try to keep rates low and to flood the market with cash in an (vain) attempt to stimulate the economy. \n \n Meanwhile the chinese, the worlds biggest bond buyers, have stated that they are going to start investing in eurozone bonds, to the detriment of treasury bonds, until we can get our fiscal house in order.\n \n We cannot afford to tell them \"no\". We do and they will just stop buying our debt and we will have to make the cuts because we simply do not have any money to pay the bills. \n \n \n \n\n The words liberal and conservative apply to math too, when the government is cooking the books and playing word games. . When a \"surplus\" is declared, because a budget deficit is only half of the original projection, for example. The reason the American people seem stupid to you concerning math is because they have little patience with numbers games. Accountants don't seem to have an interest in presenting numbers in a simple, understandable way. You and Steeeeve didn't say a thing about the numbers I showed in post #66, about the $1.2 billion to run the House of Representatives, or the $661.6 million for the \"Library of Congress\", (as only two examples) What were these figures in 1995? 1985? 1975? 1965? If comparisons like this were shown for all government spending of the past, it wouldn't be hard to see where U.S. financial problems are. And corrective measures wouldn't be taxing the rich more. \n\n \n Right...the problem is that it is NOT simple and americans apparently dont want to be stressed by being expected to understand complex things. They like simple and stoopid. \n \n \n \n\n Colin Powell is a fence sitting flip flopper, like a lot of politicians and forum posters I've seen. \n\n \n ROTFLMAO. Colin Powell??????? \n You would not know a conservative if one fell out of the sky, landed on your face, and started flopping. \n \n \n \n \nEvery Republican and every Democrat believes their position is logical. So does every third-world dictator. Your opinion is no more special than anyone else's. You can do all the math and financial calculations you want, but you can't predict the future and future human behavior any better than anyone else. \n\n \n And when I post opinions I am careful to note it is an opinion. I will say \"in my opinion\" or \"I am predicting\". I dont actually post that many opinions, Marc. You are welcome to your own opinion, Marc, but not your own facts. When it comes to economics, a lot of outcomes are inevitable. The failure in the housing market was inevitable, and its continued failure in inevitable. You only had to look at the underlying fundamentals to see that. There was no question. For every 1% interest rates increased, 20% of people were priced out of the housing market. Likewise we knew that roughly 40% of ARMS issued in the last 5 years had resets coming up, and that only about 6% of the people holding those resetting loans had the disposable income to cover their higher payments. \n \n It is not simple, but it is also not complicated. You have to actually look at the FACTS, not just a bunch of made up political rhetoric. \n \n \n \n Liberals have changed a LOT. JFK was a liberal in the 1960's. There was no imperial EPA in the 1960's, there were no claims that healthcare was an automatic right for U.S. citizens. Just two examples of many. \n \n \n \n \nTraditional morals have declined in the U.S. Past traditional conservatives have compromised (\"maybe healthcare IS a right\", \"maybe there is no difference in greed and profit and we really do need the EPA to protects us from these ruthless corporations\", \"maybe filth and porn on the net are an okay way to protect free speech\", on and on) The ones who haven't compromised are the ones you call the neocons, the Beck's, the Palin's, the tea party movement. The only actual conservatives left. \n\n \n No, they are the brainless fools who fail to understand that the world is a more complex place than their underwear drawer.\n \n Do you remember acid rain, Marc?? Millions of acres of forests wiped out. Buildings damaged. Life wiped out in many streams and lakes. \n \n The federal government did a 10 year study to determine the causes of the acid rain that were doing so much damage. Then they passed amendments to the clean air act limiting sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. The result?? A massive reduction in the amount of acid rain in the US.\n \n Now, you and Palin, who are pretty much incapable of analytical thinking, therefore incapable of understanding complex relationships, would do nothing on the assumption that the market would somehow take care of the problem. The problem was that no single entity was producing enough sulfur dioxide to really be the culprit. It took a combined effort to stop/slow the acid rain. It took government action. That is what the government is supposed to do. \n \n \n \n \nAnd the liberals are happy to have you if you think that the Chinese are avoiding pushing the sell button because they feel sorry for us. They don't push that button because it's not in their own best interests to push it. \n\n \n That is BS on 2 fronts. First, EVERYBODY, liberals and conservatives alike, recognize that it is in their own best interests to not just dump our bonds on the open market. INTELLIGENT people, however, recognize that it will not ALWAYS be in their own best interests to keep us afloat. Likewise they are not the only major player who could cause a complete failure of the US. There are about a dozen major traders out there including the chinese and all have vowed to NOT be the last guys out the door. ANY of them start selling and everybody who is holding our bonds pretty much has to sell in order to salvage what value they can. \n \n The problem is that a lot of the Becks and Palins and Marcs out there can not get it through their non analytic little minds that it will not always be in their best interests to hold our debt and finance our worldwide rule. The chinese used their bond holdings to scare the US fleet away from interfering with their handling of Taiwan when Bush was in office. They used them to threaten congress to avoid trade sanctions last year. They used it to lock us out of a lot of Iraqi oil projects and have used it to lock us out of a lot of S American oil projects. \n \n \n\n We don't lack the infrastructure, we lack the LIBERTY. \n\n \n This is simply retarded, Marc. We lack the infrastructure. We lack the people with the knowledge. 20 years ago we led the world in technology. Today, if you want high tech, you go to Taiwan, Ireland, or korea. You want the top engineers in the world you go to India, Pakistan, or S Korea. You want cutting edge utility and public infrastructure, then you want china. \n \n \nAnd your assessment of the Democrats? [crickets chirping] \n\n \n Honestly?? They almost seem to get it. They need to take a long, hard look at their social programs and the actual impact they have both budgetary and from a market distortion standpoint. They do not say stupid things like \"we are going to address the deficit without raising taxes or touching military spending\" because that is impossible. \n \n The truth is that the democrats have taken the republicans place as the fiscal conservatives. If you look at the last 30 years, government spending and government growth have both increased FASTER under republicans administrations than under the democrats. For you to pooh pooh the democrats spending as destructive just shows how foolish and uninformed you are when it comes to who is actually spending what. \n \n \n \nYou're describing \"opportunity\" not for the entire society, but only for a few, often at the expense of the rest of society. Ever hear of the website \"Endofamerica.com\"? Or Endofamerica15.com? Or EndofAmerica29.com? Or Endofamerica34.com? They all go to the same place, the numbers are there only for him to analyze exactly where the biggest sucker markets are. It's advertised as free advise on how to protect yourself when the big crash comes. And after sitting through about 45 minutes of dire predictions about how the U.S. dollar is about to become completely useless, no free advise is given! You have to send him 50 useless dollars to find that out! Then while he's telling you what to do to protect yourself, he'll also tell you how to take advantage of the situation, and make some big bucks at everyone else's expense. He's probably found 100,000 suckers from my area alone, considering his advertising binge. That's a cool $5 million for him. He knows how it's done allright. The erosion of morality in the U.S. is largely what has caused so many flim flam men to flourish. It contributes to U.S financial problems just as much as anything else. \n\n \n No. It is opportunity for those smart enough to take advantage of it. That is what free markets are all about, Marc. \n \n You were free to short the heck out of Citibank. I did. I even talked about it here and laid out my case for doing so. Did you??? You were free to buy the heck out of BP when their stock was trading for nothing post spill. I did. I laid out my case for doing so here. Did you??\n \n The opportunity is there. The fact you dont take advantage of it is on you. \n \n \nYou call it \"Shockingly simple\", and call the electorate's view of it \"overly simplistic\". Why are you right and the electorate wrong?\n\n \n NO, I say our economy is shockingly simple. The events leading to the inevitable collapse of the US are actually fairly complex. \n \n We are talking about 2 different things. If you lay your hand on a cinder block and I hit it with a sledge hammer, it is going to break your hand. That is simple. However, we could spend the rest of our lives looking at the atomic structure of the sledge hammer and the biology that allows your hand to break and my arm to swing and never fully understand them. \n \n That does not change the fact that if I hit your hand with the sledge hammer, it is going to break.",

   "Reluctantly Yes, I would vote yes. This is one situation where IMO the House will have no choice but to vote yes. We are currently closing in on the Ceiling as it stands and The U.S. simply cannot afford to default on our Debt. A Government shut down at this point would do way more harm than raising the Debt Ceiling. Police and Firemen Jobs are not in Jeopardy because I believe most of those are State Governments and not Federal. We would have No Mail service, and most devastating would be the Millions of People on Social Security and Medicare that would not receive benefits. The most worrisome for me is the Power shift that would happen if they say no. If faced with Defaulting on the National Debt the Treasurer has the power to do pretty much what he needs to do to pay that debt, and with him being an Obama appointment That would basically shift the Power to Obama. Congress is in a Lose Lose situation and they know it, but IMO if they do the right thing and raise the ceiling now I think the voters will forgive them for breaking a Promise. If they say no and the Government is forced to shut down they won't be so lucky come 2012 elections.\n\n \n The treasurer has the same powers now that he would if they did not increase the debt ceiling. His powers do not change at all, he just has to start acting like the CFO at a company with a liquidity problem. \n \n We could actually fail to increase the debt ceiling without defaulting on our debt. Congress would just have to pass a bill instructing the treasury secretary to prioritize spending so debt interest and bond redemption come first. \n \n I dont know if the voters will forgive them or not. According to recent polls, 71% of Americans strongly oppose raising the debt ceiling. There is not an elected official in all of washington that has, or has ever had, a 71% approval rating. We could not get 71% of people to agree on what color the sky is. That is a HUGE stop sign to those in congress. \n \n I could see Americans \"forgiving\" their elected officials for voting for an increase if they gained MAJOR spending concessions. And I think those spending concessions are going to have to be in line with what Americans actually want to cut. Interesting article about that here:\n \n Public strongly opposes debt ceiling increase: Reuters/Ipsos | Reuters\n \n \n(Reuters) - The U.S. public overwhelmingly opposes raising the country's debt limit even though failure to do so could hurt America's international standing and push up borrowing costs, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday.\n \n Some 71 percent of those surveyed oppose increasing the borrowing authority, the focus of a brewing political battle over federal spending. Only 18 percent support an increase\n\n \n It is interesting to note that, like the bank bailouts, those responding ARE aware of the potential consequences. If the American people are aware of the consequences and willing to accept them, congress is going to have a hard time making a \"for your own good\" excuse.\n \n One thing I thought was interesting in the article was that the majority advocated military spending cuts. I would have thought the numbers would be more spread on that. Apparently people are starting to realize that spending more than the rest of the world combined on our military is kind of silly. \n \n I just have trouble seeing the republicans, and particularly the tea baggers, recovering from this if they do not put up one hell of a fight. After all, they ran pretty much exclusively on a \"small government, fiscal responsibility\" platform. If they do not perform in that area, they are DONE.",

If the democrats were smart, they would refuse to let it pass without tax increases. Then we would have the best of both worlds. \n \n Frankly by passing the increase they are trading Americas welfare away. If they did not pass it, but did pass legislation requiring Geithner to prioritize our cash outlays so bonds/interest came first, not only would it not hurt our credit standing, it would help it. \n \n It would also force republicans to actually look at their budget and admit the fact that their 2% annual savings are a complete and utter joke. It would force democrats to look at their social programs and really think about which are helping people, which are hurting people, and how effective they really are. It would force the government to cut fannie and freddie loose. Granted that would lead to a housing implosion that would make the last one look like a little hiccup in the market, but it would also allow the housing correction to finish sooner rather than later. \n \n Refusing to increase the budget ceiling, essentially saying \"NO MORE...from this point forth we are going to be responsible\" IS the right thing to do. That is not to say it is going to happen. Our elected leaders probably lack the fortitude to do it. Instead they will raise the debt limit. The republicans will put forth a 2% cut in the budget and then pretend like they have actually done something worthwhile. The democrats will fight tooth and nail to keep all the social programs...even the ones that have been shown to create market distortions that have a net negative impact on those they are trying to help.

Then it was the democrats pushing for spending cuts and the republicans promised that they would include them in the future in order to get the debt ceiling raised. Instead they further cut taxes and increased spending. That went well. \n \n This was the entire point of congress putting a debt ceiling in place. It requires that they step back and take a look every once in a while at our fiscal situation and gives the fiscal conservatives the leverage they need to make reforms. \n \n I am not entirely certain that a straight out refusal to pass the increase is off the table. I know my senator will be voting against the increase regardless of the consequences. He has apparently had a large number of constituents flooding his office with input against raising the ceiling, and only 2 people have contacted his office encouraging him to raise it. It has apparently been made clear to him by his base that if he votes in favor of it, his senate career will be short. \n \n And this is KANSAS, where republicans just assume they will hold the senate seats. Of course, they always just assumed they would hold the governors mansion until they stopped listening to what their constituents told them to do. Then we punished them and put a democrat in there. \n \n I would like to see a poll dedicated exclusively to what people think the impact of failing to raise the debt ceiling would be. When they were looking at passing the bank bailout bill, most polls had 90-97% of Americans opposing the move. The interesting thing was that they were also running polls about what americans thought would happen if they did not pass the bailout and anywhere from 70-85% of americans thought our financial system would collapse. That is a HUGE overlap. Even if we assume that ALL the americans who were opposed to the bill also thought our financial system would collapse (a logical assumption I think), that still leaves a WIDE majority of people who believed our financial system would collapse and STILL opposed the bailout. THEY UNDERSTOOD THE CONSEQUENCES AND WERE WILLING TO ACCEPT THEM.\n \n OF course they passed the bailout, and in order to mitigate the impact for any particular elected representative they did so by essentially all agreeing to pass it. \n \n 90-97% of americans opposed, and they passed it anyway. How is that representative government?? Its not. It is tyranny. \n \n This vote is a little different because they are not going to make a \"we will all vote for it so none of us has to suffer at the polls for it\" deal. On this vote, there are a lot of representatives who are simply going to refuse to vote for it. Those who do are probably going to be punished for it at the polls.\n \n What the crossover in the bank bailout polls, and the overwhelming support for NOT raising the debt ceiling despite the warning of the consequences tells me is that Americans DO understand the consequences, and they just dont care. They are willing to take them.\n \n I think this is the result of an America where people are fed up with our government. We have tried the republicans, we have tried the democrats, we have mixed them, and at every step along the way we just get screwed a little harder. The simple fact of the matter is that America is NOT WORKING for most Americans and it has reached the point that, to be frank, they are willing to see it fail and see what we can rebuild. \n \n Frankly, I am sympathetic to this view. For 90% of Americans the absolute best they have to look forward to are various levels of debt slavery. The best we can hope to leave our children is a completely dysfunctional, fascist country with no economic prospects and no chance of turning it around. Wow. That is something I really want to hand down to my children. \n \n The choice boils down to this. Do we suffer today, or do we leave the suffering for our children? The baby boomers chose the latter. I like to think that my generation can do better.",

The FAR more likely outcome would be that we continue to finance our debt service costs while shutting down/blocking funding to non critical government spending. How hard is it really going to hit your average American if we dont give Egypt $2 billion this year? Frankly, we could cut ALL foreign aid and your average american is not even going to notice. Likewise would anybody actually notice if we put half the inspectors at OSHA and MSHA on furlough? Doubtful. \n \n There are a LOT of spending cuts we could make that the American public would probably not even notice. We could cut 20% out of the military budget right off the bat and if they cleaned up military accounting the military would not even notice. We are not fighting a war in Iraq any more, we are pulling out. Why do we feel compelled to keep military spending where it was while we were actually fighting the war? \n \n I am not saying that the debt ceiling will not be raised. It probably will.

It is due over the course of the next 30 years. There is no reason that we should have to default on any of it whether we raise the debt ceiling or not. \n \n \n \nNo, actually we don't have enough Cash Flow to Pay ALL the debt. \n \n Our monthly bills average about $300 billion, while revenues are about $180 billion.

With the Bush Tax cuts extended we can't expect to draw in enough revenue even if they cut across the board it will take years before we realize any real change.\n\n \n Wrong. The 60 cents on the dollar is not just the debt, it is the debt plus all other federal spending. We absolutely have the cash flow to pay the debt, IF we cut the other federal spending. \n \n That would not leave us much to run the government on, but we could raise taxes to make up the difference. First we would have to repeal the bush tax cuts. Then we would have to remove the EITC. Then we would have to double the taxes of the wealthy and increase the taxes of the middle class by about 65%. \n \n That would leave us with enough to run the important parts of the government. Granted it would not leave us with enough to hand out foreign aid billions of dollars at a time. It does not leave us with the money for federal education, but that was never constitutional anyway. DOT would have to be pared back to where it is actually supported by gas taxes, as it was always supposed to be. The federal government would have to get out of the landlord game. \n \n It would be difficult to do, but Euro zone nations are doing it right now.

It is a painful option certainly, but it IS a viable option, and it seems to be the option that most Americans support.\n \n Our politicians ignore the will of the people at their own peril.",

   "Colin Powell supported Obama for president. He is pro gun control, and pro abortion. If you don't understand why I don't waste any more of my time having a discussion with you, I just can't help you.\n\n \n The American Conservative -- Colin Powell, Conservative?\n \n \"And in the struggle to prevent the rise of an empire that will surely collapse in blood, Colin Powell is true conservatism's ally.\"\n \n That is a quote from an article in American Conservative magazine by Pat Buchanan. Are we going to pretend that Pat Buchanan is now a flaming liberal as well?\n \n Marc, a LOT of traditional conservatives supported Obama over McCain. That is why he won by a landslide. There are 2 reasons for this. First, Bush completely and totally abandoned conservative ideals and instead of reigning him in, the republicans in congress betrayed the CONSERVATIVES who put them there in the name of partisan politics. We saw the biggest expansion of government under Bush EVER. We saw a federal government XXXX all over the constitution, push our deficit to unbelievable levels, and we saw freedoms eroded in the name of the nanny state. We, the actual conservatives, were NOT HAPPY with this and we punished the republican party and you know what....IT WORKED. The republicans seem to have learned their lesson. We NOW have republicans in congress who actually seem to feel that they are beholding to their conservative constituents.\n \n The republican party had lost its way. They got confused about who their base is. Their base was NOT bible thumpers, or nascar dads, or ignorant hillbillies. Their base is guys like me. Well educated, conservative thinkers. They took our votes for granted while they catered to ignorant hillbillies who cant seem to wrap their head around simple math. Bad news for them...they learned that they cannot take those votes for granted because if the BS gets too deep, and the rhetoric gets too ignorant, we will go with the more intelligent of the candidates.\n \n This brings us to the second reason that a lot of traidtional conservatives supported Obama over McCain. The McCain campaign pretty much counted on anybody who voted for them being completely and totally retarded, and frankly those who bought into the campaign had to have been. Their fiscal positions made NO SENSE whatsoever and relied on math that was complete and utter fantasy. Their foreign policy and energy policies had absolutely no connection whatsoever to reality. And Sara Palin is a ditz. The woman is just plain dumb and her inclusion in the campaign was a completely transparent effort to give the dumb hillbillies whose votes they were courting a pair of tits to vote for. \n \n Take a look at Powells actual position on the election. It actually mirrors my own:\n \n Colin Powell - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n\n Powell donated the maximum allowable amount to John McCain's campaign in the summer of 2007[68] and in early 2008, his name was listed as a possible running mate for Republican nominee McCain's bid during the 2008 U.S. presidential election.[69] However, on October 19, 2008, Powell announced his endorsement of Barack Obama during a Meet the Press interview, citing \"his ability to inspire, because of the inclusive nature of his campaign, because he is reaching out all across America, because of who he is and his rhetorical abilities,\" in addition to his \"style and substance.\" He additionally referred to Obama as a \"transformational figure\".[70][71] Powell further questioned McCain's judgment in appointing Sarah Palin as the vice presidential candidate, stating that despite the fact that she is admired, \"now that we have had a chance to watch her for some seven weeks, I don't believe she's ready to be president of the United States, which is the job of the vice president.\"\n\n \n Yes...not only did Powell heavily support McCain to being with, he was a front runner as McCains running mate. I dont know whether it is true or not, but the rumor at the time was that he was offered the position and turned it down. \n \n Then, like most other traditional conservatives (the non ignorant hillbilly ones) he started to notice that what was coming out of the McCain camp was pretty much ridiculous rantings with no connection to reality. McCain was not going to FIX the problems that Bush left, he was going to make them MUCH worse.\n \n In the end, though, what actually killed McCain was the financial crisis. He had NO IDEA what was going on and that was clear every time he opened his mouth. He even said...on national TV....\"I dont know that much about the economy\". \n \n Only a retard would have voted for him at that point. Our entire economy was collapsing, and one of the candidates gets up there and says they dont really know anything about it, you have to be brain dead to vote for that guy.",

We\n also conduct various research\n projects on the improvement of\n the railway network.\n\n \n \nWe provide various subsidies for\n railway companies to promote\n the construction of railway\n facilities and technical developments.\n\n \n You need to research these things a little better because the fact is that it is illegal for private companies in Japan to build rail lines.

Then let's start with a well known power grid innovator, Westinghouse Electric Company.\n \n Please elaborate on the key role the government had (don't make me laugh by saying 'patents').\n \n\n \n You mean besides the fact that Westinghouses first generating station at Niagra was paid for by a grant from the US government? Or do you want a bigger example, like the fact that both state and federal governments provided MASSIVE subsidies (and still do today) for grid construction and update. Or are you looking for the mother of all examples, which is that federal and state agencies granted monopolies to companies like westinghouse which guaranteed, through the elimination of competition, that their investments would be successful? \n \n That is why states have special powers in regulating utilities. They get those special abilities because the state has granted the utility a monopoly in order to assure their profitability, but in return the utilities were required to accept a higher standard of regulation in order to protect customers since the potential for abuse in a state mandated monopoly are HUGE. \n \n \nIn the end if a government invests in something but your justification for why is that no one would naturally risk their money on it, the only conclusion then is that the government invests money that people are not willing to risk but pretends to add security by the national debt and of course the economic security of just taking it from whomever they want if they need to.\n\n \n \n Wrong. That is not what I am saying at all. That is an incredibly simplistic view that has almost no relation to reality.

   "Beautifully said. This is one aspect of the economy that took be a while to grasp. Having private companies do everything seems good in theory until you realize no one wants to wait 30 years to see if the road they invested in was a good investment. Same thing with most basic infrastructure. This is exactly why Amtrak is a total failure. We want private companies to front the infrastructure and the government will supply the equipment and personnel assets. That would be like private companies running the airports and Government Air taking off from it.\n\n \n This is one place where the \"free market\" guys start looking like retarded chimps. While it may theoretically be a neat idea to have private companies do everything the fact is that there is a HUGE difference between public sector and private sector finance and a HUGE difference in investor expectations. \n \n That is EXACTLY why Amtrak is such a failure. No private company can justify the cash expenditures required for the infrastructure build out. Even if they could come up with the money, the payback is too long term. \n \n The entire point of infrastructure projects is that EVERYBODY benefits from them. The interstate highway system has paid for itself thousands of times over, and every single person who has ever conducted any business at all in this country has seen substantial benefit from that investment. The same goes for the electric grid. The same goes for out phone system. Same for our rail system.\n \n Where we screw up in the US is that the taxpayer ends up footing the bill for the infrastructure development either directly, through subsidies, or through a combination of cash subsidies and protected market agreements. Then private companies end up in possession of the infrastructure in question with the agreement that they operate it, maintain it, and keep it up to date. The screw up part is where we then all forget where the infrastructure came from to begin with. Then, for example, when we REALLY need to see our electrical grid updated, or our high speed internet updated, half the country acts like it would be unreasonable to tell those companies to do with the infrastructure that WE paid for and gave them. So we end up trying to compete in a digital world using 1950s infrastructure.",

If the change is predictably bad there will also be less speculation but that is clearly a function of the change and not how fast it is carried out.\n \n \nAt this point, before I waste a lot of time responding to your posts, please explain your concept of morality and how it relates to government and taxation. \n\n http://www.4forums.com/political/formal-open-debate/14447-society-based-volition-ideal-one.html\n \n \n \nIt leads to some pretty big holes in the conversation, like when you say that rules against fraud can be as simple as saying \"no fraud\", and you seem to assume that everybody shares your morals\n\n My morals apply to everyone, everyone does not accept them completly; almost everyone accepts sections at a time but too often for the wrong reason: because they have an emotional reaction.\n \n \nso will automatically know what you consider to be \"fraud\", when, in fact, MOST of our financial regulations are in fact an effort to DEFINE fraud. \n \n Fraud | Define Fraud at Dictionary.com\n \n That's a lot of beuracracy for something that has been done and I can do.\n \n My definition of fraud is: The act of decieving another at any point in the process of trade.\n \n That deception can be lying about what is being sold, lying about how much would be charged, lying about the terms of trade, etc.\n \n It along with theft constitute the objective economic crimes.\n \n I can give you some tips on indentifying a mislabeled fraud law (mislabeled as regulation) and indentifying a true regulation.\n \n Fraud laws will always speak towards an economic agreement (trade), they will always include an element of dishonesty in one party. Objectively only dishonesty of fabrication and not dishonesty of ommission are permitted as no court could prove that it occured to a party to provide any peice of information.\n \n They have defendants but most importantly there are always victims, specific victims as there must be in all true crimes.\n \n Regulations are never about dishonesty but about permissable types of trading. limits are set on how or why or when economic activity of some kind can take place. If someone shows up at a bussiness and informs them that they are in violation of a couple regulations and that they have until next month to fix the violations, they are not commiting fraud; fraud is a crime, it is not something you can 'fix' it is not something the government leaves to you.\n \n A absolutely positive way of identifying a regulation and not a fraud law is if it can apply to a theoretical super macgyver type who (somehow doesn't matter how) can do all the things he wants to do without trading for it. This theoretical person should be incapable of commiting fraud.\n \n Yet, and you must know this; there are hundreds of ways for him to violate government regulations just by building his own house on his property.\n \n Who did he trick? What deal was a lie?\n \n \nAlso, your insistence that taxation is theft is both bizarre and factually incorrect. Theft is the illegal or felonious taking of anothers property without their consent. Taxation is legal, therefore cannot be theft.\n \n Are you prepared to stand by that definition in all cases ?(because if you don't that means you don't agree with it)\n \n My definition is similar but lacking the sad unjustifiable addition of a collectives temporal ideas on morality.\n \n Theft - The taking of property or wealth without the consent of the owner.\n \n \nAre you working this toward your \"voluntary\" taxation system where smart people pay to ensure we have clean air to breathe and clean water to drink, but dumb people still get to breathe the air and drink the water as well? Where smart people pay for infrastructure but dumb people still get to use it? That is not \"voluntary taxation\", that is a free ride for id10ts who are not bright enough to understand complex structural interactions.\n\n If anything deserved a 'childish and nonsensical' it was that and I will explain, but first an actual response:\n \n \nAre you working this toward your \"voluntary\" taxation system \n\n Yes, however; it seems to cause far less confusion if the word taxation is reserved to the government taking of wealth regardless of consent.\n \n At first I did use words like voluntary taxation but enough people told me 'well that is just charity or donations' that I have decided those words are better, especially since it causes much confusion when I in fact say I am arguing against taxation.\n \n So to be abudently clear.\n \n Taxation != any government funding\n \n Taxation = government funding in which the consent of the taxed is irrelavent\n \n \nwhere smart people pay to ensure we have clean air to breathe and clean water to drink, but dumb people still get to breathe the air and drink the water as well? Where smart people pay for infrastructure but dumb people still get to use it?\n\n If the smart people agree to such a situation yes, if they don't then no.\n \n \nThat is not \"voluntary taxation\", that is a free ride for id10ts who are not bright enough to understand complex structural interactions\n\n Then I suppose you would not be willing to pay for a society in which either by unavoidable physical neccecity or by the fact that not enough people agree with you to matter you provide some benefit to some who are not paying as much as you.\n \n If my volitional society existed I nor anyone else could tell you that you must pay because there are more of us or because it is traditional.\n \n I have choosen long ago to take the only position that is both moral and practical:\n \n I will pay for what is neccesary to live in the kind of society I want, I will permit myself some annoyance at freeloaders but nothing more provided they are not violating rights. I will not attempt to enslave them or anyone else because I think the way I would run a societies affairs must be universal (for that is a neccesary premise of demanding that everyone comform to a set of programs regardless of whether they agree with all of it or not).\n \n I would of course be in favour of limiting freeloading but only in cases where such limitation actually conserves appreciable net resources and not if such limitations are due to an emotional response to 'unfairness'.\n \n i.e. stopping police from doing their job in neighbor hoods that have a low rate of payers to the police dept. \n \n I would not be for such a measure for several reasons, first and foremost is that I believe the it is the job of police to capture criminals and preserve the peace, chaos and fear are produced just as surely by the murder (just an example) of a freeloader as the murder of a responsible citizen, and the mere act of murder makes the criminal a proper target of the police. Evil must be destroyed for good to thrive, it cannot be compartmentalized easily.\n \n Secondly even if one wasn't swayed by the observation that it would be counter-productive to protect only those who pay it would be practicaly unsound as letting a criminal go even if by refusing to investigate is allowing a criminal to run free who is by his very existance a threat to everyone including those who have agreed to pay. A criminal is a threat to everyone\n \n Finally even if the first two were not good enough if you forced police to protect only paying citizens utter barbarsim would erupt because those who did not pay would be constant and easy targets for theives and murderers who would need to fear no reprisal so long as they killed only those who could not or would not pay. No one has a moral obligation to help others but healthy people have the desire to as they value human life\n \n As a real world example Europe never paid us to help free the continent in WWII, but we did anyway because hitler was evil (point 1) his alliance was attacking us (point 2), we wanted to stop the oppression and pain in europe(point 3).\n \n A case where freeloading could be limited practicaly would be tolling roads, roads are already tolled and we now have the technology to do it precisley and accuratly in the future to a point where the roads need not be a public service but a service offered.\n \n Now for why it is childish and nonsensical.\n \n 1. The world is not divided into smart people and dumb people, nor even into productive people and unproductive people (although how much people produce is highly variable). Treating the situation like this is merely repackaged class based thinking that has no basis in any moral derivations. A man is a man is a man, labels don't matter only actions.\n \n 2. No single person knows enough about how all complex structures work to make competant decesions on everything. That is why experts are hired and companies and teams exist.

You would not give these 'XXXXXX' the choice of paying for something or not but you haven't indicated any objection to their current right of voting for and electing officials who have the power to choose whether you pay for something.\n \n You would endorse (I bet) a system where the majority (XXXXXX and all) votes on represntatives who will (most of the time) do what they are elected for which means tax everyone according to how the majority wants to spend it's money but when confronted with the idea of cutting out the elect-standardize step you object that this step is required or else XXXXXX wouldn't pay for neccesary things.\n \n There can be only one situation in which this objection is valid and that is that the majority makes the right decesion while the minority of XXXXXX are forced to pay as the majority deems.\n \n Morally the majority (nor any government) may force their judgements on the minority.\n \n Practicaly however since the majority knows what they are doing (if you accept majority rule in the first place) that means the majority of people will spend money directly on the right things.\n \n If you want you can set up a poll asking what people think is neccesary for a good society, I bet you there will be a lot of agreement, if you find something that over 90% of the people think is neccesary I don't see how you could claim that such an item would not receive funding if these same people were given the choice to spend their money as they see fit.\n \n \nActually, all property is theft.\n \n That would make taxation (and for that matter all income) receiving stolen property.\n\n Would you elaborate on that?",

It means you cannot condemn them unless you hold some philosophy along the lines of 'the strong get their way' or 'the majority is always right'.\n \n A philosophy that could hold now with the U.S and other sane (on this scale) countries hold vast majorities and even vaster military superiority over more barbaric groups, but would not hold when this was not the case; in the dark ages or in nazi Germany for instance.\n \n Would you then hold that the Nazi powers or your feudal lord was correct just because they were strong? Just because they could pass laws?\n \n Would you stand by your belief that no absolute morality exists?\n \n History tells us that this is unlikely, religion as a whole is a phenomenon because it offers men absolute morality, men NEED an absolute morality and they will do anything even destroy their own minds by believing any superstition for it.\n \n \nMorals are often not even the same for like or similar people living at the same time in the same society.

If the above was true, there would be no people in jail because those criminals could simply not choose to give their consent to be governed and the government would be powerless against them. \n \n If there is some wider logic behind this you need to state it HERE, not hope that somebody will draw it out of you later because frankly what you have written here is just idiocy and not worthy of response. \n \n \nThe greatest lesson history has to tell us is that the shortsighted fools have always thought their system of government was the only one that would work, believed that the glory of their government gave it the right to trample human rights.\n \n\n \n This is pretty much unrelated to anything in this entire thread. \n \n \nWe have exchanged unquestioning respect for the emperor for unquestioning respect for the majority. I say we to be polite because I have stopped. What you consider necessary is meaningless before the dictates of morality. I know that a moral society can exist, but even if it could not that dooms us to injustice; it does not justify failure.\n\n \n Her you talk about the dictates of morality, and claim that a moral society can exist, but you have still not explained what you would consider to be a moral society. It is very obvious that MOST people do not share your morals (example....I actually tried asking people if taxes were theft. NOBODY I asked thought they were....most just rolled their eyes at me and told me to stop associating with lunatics). If you are going to argue that a \"moral\" society should/could exist, you are going to have to define that...including explaining the morals that you want it to be based on since they are apparently personal morals that the majority of society do not share. Then you need to explain why society should change to accept YOUR morals and why doing so would be better for both individuals and society as a whole. \n \n Asking marginally relevant rhetorical questions and making vague, and often ridiculous, statements while implying that there is some deeper moralistic meaning behind it all does not cut it here. Nobody is interested in your BS and nobody is going to work to get you to explain the system that you keep hinting around the edges of. If you want somebody to cozy up with your ego and ask questions about your ideas, find a liberal arts board somewhere (or maybe the forum at high times). \n \n Here, if you have a POINT, you are expected to make it. We debate realities here based on information. Your posts generally contain neither. They literally sound like the ramblings I heard from stoned out of their mind would be philosophers when I was in college. Back then it was entertaining. Here it is just annoying. \n \n The next time you see a post here you want to comment on, sit down and decide what point you want to make or what argument you want to pursue.

   "Again, what is your point here.\n\n The point of that post was to illustrate why the analogy you were making was incorrect.\n \n In the post you made before that you gave (I assumed) an analogy the situation of someone going to another's house, that they must then follow their rules at their house as it is a privilege to be allowed inside.\n \n The analogy indicates that you were arguing that the power of the collective is an extension of property rights, i.e. 'their country their rules'.\n \n My response was to, in the same terms as the analogy; point out that the collective does not own the country, that the collective as an entity (legal entity if you will) does not exist and certainly cannot own the country. Individuals, companies, and government own the country in a patchwork, unless you are claiming that the government owns the entire country the extension of property rights cannot be applied.\n \n Further you should know two more thing about my philosophy, 1. I don't think you can own property in the same way you can own a car or a house, I think the term claim is better.\n \n 2. I obviously don't recognize a government and by extension a collectives right to take property from people so even if you did claim that the last case was so, I would deny and argue the point.\n \n \nIt has occured to me that if you are not a bot, then maybe you are just really, really terrible at this and dont realize it. I am going to help you out here. \n\n No you are going to try to make some points, finding me unfazed and ready with a response at every corner you will become frustrated or what ever you would like to call it, you will stop trying to argue and you will try to justify it by name calling or saying that it is pointless to argue with me.\n \n I implore you to ask yourself what the point is now so that you know when it becomes pointless.\n \n \nYou make statements like this. If you want to argue that people are using an incorrect definition of the word \"society\", then do so.\n\n I didn't say they were using the wrong definition I said they did not know what it is.\n \n \nPut forth your definition here. \n\n -noun \n 1. an organized group of persons associated together for religious, benevolent, cultural, scientific, political, patriotic, or other purposes. \n 2. a body of individuals living as members of a community; community. \n 3. the body of human beings generally, associated or viewed as members of a community: the evolution of human society. \n 4. a highly structured system of human organization for large-scale community living that normally furnishes protection, continuity, security, and a national identity for its members: American society. \n \n #2. seems to apply the best to the way I use the word.\n \n \nThese vague statements just make you look unintelligent and ridiculous. \n\n I told you what it was as opposed to the mistake on the next line.\n \n Ad hominem\n \n \nStatements like this also make you look unintelligent and ridiculous.\n \n Ad hominem\n \n \nIf the above was true, there would be no people in jail because those criminals could simply not choose to give their consent to be governed and the government would be powerless against them. \n\n Ah I have encountered this response a lot. There are a couple ways to refute it and I will look at each.\n \n 1. This is going to require a little more effort on your part to understand than the other. In the derivation of my morality you will see that essentially it is being formed by sets of neccesary non-contradictory values held by individuals. i.e. if everyone was perfectly logical (they are not I know but morality is based on the ideal by definition) than the self-consistency of their beliefs and values form the absolute morality. The essence of objective morality (the morality based on the relationships between all these beliefs) is that you deal with each man based on his beliefs, not his hypocrisies but his beliefs. So now the important part, if a man truly believes in violence, truly does not believe rights exist he has forfeited his own by virtue of exempting himself by his own values from the source of objective morality. Locking up a criminal is dealing with him on his own terms of force, he set the standard of social interaction there, not the police. So answer number one is that they have given their consent in an irrefutable way, by their actions.\n \n 2. On the surface, the argument you just made seems like an easy one; if a government needs the consent of anyone to do anything to them, then they can't do anything to criminals right? Few seem to think about the side of the box they just opened, by making no distinction between a criminal and an innocent person they have established that the government needs the consent of either equally. Observe the inverse implication of this equivocation though: in your government the reason the government has power over innocent people is the same reason it has power over criminals. You establish that no one has a right to freedom, the government just decides that innocent people deserve more than criminals.\n \n The truth is that it is not all or nothing, the government does not need to have absolute power over everyone or no power over anyone.\n \n There is a key concept with which you can establish the rights of a government, the government derives it's power from the governed as you noted. This is perfectly logical, a man can delegate or extend his rights to another by legal empowerment. What the government cannot do is exceed the rights of any of it's constituents. This is the principle of equality, if all men have the same rights it is a simple deduction to see that a government which derives it's power only from men (i.e. no theocracy or divine right here) then it has the same rights as any individual.\n \n Seeking justice, self-defense, recovery of goods; none of it requires the consent of the violator for the individual nor for the government.\n \n but if you claim that you don't need the consent of your neighbor to take his things, you will start to run into some trouble with morality.\n \n A proper government doesn't need the consent of a criminal to stop him because an individual doesn't and an individual doesn't because of morality.\n \n This of course makes it very very easy for someone like myself to evaluate the actions of a government. I do so on the exact same standard as I evaluate any person including myself.\n \n \nIf there is some wider logic behind this you need to state it HERE\n\n If you are asking for support could you be more specific about the premise you do not agree with.\n \n \n, not hope that somebody will draw it out of you later because frankly what you have written here is just idiocy and not worthy of response. \n\n Ad Hominem\n \n \nThis is pretty much unrelated to anything in this entire thread. \n\n Unrelated to the subject of the thread, it is related to posts that have recently made.\n \n \nHer you talk about the dictates of morality, and claim that a moral society can exist, but you have still not explained what you would consider to be a moral society.\n\n You asked for this before, did you not follow my link? There is also many posts after the OP that give more detail.\n \n \nIt is very obvious that MOST people do not share your morals\n\n Most people don't even have the concept of an absolute morality besides one that came from religion, so I would have to agree with that.\n \n However many many people share my values, even if they haven't gone through the logic that would allow them to discover the true morality.\n \n \n(example....I actually tried asking people if taxes were theft. NOBODY I asked thought they were....most just rolled their eyes at me and told me to stop associating with lunatics). \n\n Perhaps one needs to leave the insane asylum before one could get an accurate description of lunacy.\n \n Here is a question, if I went to pre-civil war south and asked just about anyone if slavery was wrong (even slaves) how many would say it was do you think?\n \n In that time and in that place not many people would agree with my morals either. Should I then conclude that I have just gone insane somewhere along the line, that I am way off base and that slavery is at least a-moral if not moral?\n \n I think not, it is easy for someone in your mindset to denounce something like slavery as everyone you meet already agrees that it is a theft of life, liberty, and happiness. It takes someone in my mindset to denounce based on something more reasonable and objective than public opinion polls.\n \n \nIf you are going to argue that a \"moral\" society should/could exist, you are going to have to define that...including explaining the morals that you want it to be based on since they are apparently personal morals that the majority of society do not share.\n\n Read the link please.\n \n \nThen you need to explain why society should change to accept YOUR morals and why doing so would be better for both individuals and society as a whole. \n\n I call them 'my morals' for convenience, they are universal. Why should society chance to accept my morals? It shouldn't. It should change to become true to the morals.\n \n Anyone who disagrees with 'my morals' may only do so by at some point committing a logic error commonly described in a person a hypocrisy. It is the failure to extend established attributes to all similar existants.\n \n To give you a feel for this note that no one can denounce my advocacy of liberty, they would have to proceed on that premise to believe they have the right to denounce something they don't think is true.\n \n 'my morality' is as simple as applying this value to all individuals, integrating over the collective, and canceling overlapping 'rights' domains by virtue that they cannot properly be found in an individuals pre-societal values on man.\n \n \nAsking marginally relevant rhetorical questions and making vague, and often ridiculous, statements while implying that there is some deeper moralistic meaning behind it all does not cut it here. Nobody is interested in your BS and nobody is going to work to get you to explain the system that you keep hinting around the edges of. If you want somebody to cozy up with your ego and ask questions about your ideas, find a liberal arts board somewhere (or maybe the forum at high times). \n\n Ask as your curiosity prompts you, while it is true that I do have ideas on how to 'fix' our society and establish a moral one I did not bring that up in this thread. You did by way of immediately jumping to 'what I would do' when in fact I was only talking about morality in reference to the national debt.\n \n \nHere, if you have a POINT, you are expected to make it. We debate realities here based on information. Your posts generally contain neither. They literally sound like the ramblings I heard from stoned out of their mind would be philosophers when I was in college. Back then it was entertaining. Here it is just annoying.\n \n You here the word morality and jump to 'stoned out would be philosophers'? \n \n Daewoo, people like you are the cause of the worlds problems; not the cure.\n \n I do not call on any fuzzy mystical terms, you attempting to use real information without any real theories is just as sure to fail as someone using real theories without real information. I have both.\n \n You want to discuss our economic troubles but you balk at the idea of discussing why any of this matters, why wealth is a value.\n \n You are fighting a monster but you have no idea what it is, all you can see is the rippling on the surface which is market recessions and intermittent wars.\n \n History has always been made by the philosophies of men, that hasn't changed and isn't going to any time soon. The financial world is built on the philosophical world by definition as trade is necessarily based on political elements and all politics is a result of philosophy.\n \n \nThe next time you see a post here you want to comment on, sit down and decide what point you want to make or what argument you want to pursue. Keep the rhetorical questions to yourself. Nobody here is interested in taking a journey of self discovery. Make sure that all the facts required to make an independent analysis of your post are there. Then hit the \"submit reply\" button.\n\n Sound advice. The point I was trying to make was that you do not have a moral obligation to pay the national debt so you shouldn't proceed to plan financially based on the idea that anyone is going to pay it. Making a point by asking questions is perfectly valid.\n \n You are asking questions to which you would know the answers if you had read the link I gave you, so I would ask that before you try to make an independent analysis you actually collect the data which you have requested and which has been provided to you.",

You claim that just because one doesn't believe in a certain crime (by the way, crimes aren't all violent) then they forfeit all rights and can be dealt with in any way. Of course one does not follow from the other but more importantly this doesn't really help you with your point that we have no moral obligation to pay off the debt (which is BS for many reasons).

The decision to judge necessitates the premise that it is proper for a human being to decide the truth with reason. The decision to live necessitates the premise that it is proper for a human being to choose is own actions.\n \n Morality is not ectoplasm, it exists because no conscious rational human is exempt from these values and so every human is given a choice; he can concede that it is proper for others to choose what they believe and what they do or he can establish self-contradiction (hypocrisy).\n \n The propriety of choosing one's own actions and beliefs is summed up in the concept liberty, it is a right simply because no one can deny it without making a very real very objective logical mistake. In that way it is like a normal logical axiom, I have called this the axiom of ethics before.\n \n This is often mistaken for the 'do not judge' syndrome. Conceding the liberty of others does not conceded their right to remove others liberty. It is extremely easy to define what actions and beliefs are objectively immoral by observing that the overlap of the domains of two human being's possible beliefs and actions may are separately illogical to both; and for the same reason that the rights existed in the first place, it would be self-contradiction to believe something is proper but then to believe it is proper to violate it.\n \n \nYet nothing you stated even relates to this.\n\n It was no I who directed this discussion in this direction.

So answer number one is that they have given their consent in an irrefutable way, by their actions.\n\n \n Morality is not based on logic. At all. In most cases morals are based on empathy...emotion...which is not logical. \n \n If you are going to play Mr Spock you need to work harder at it \n \n \n2. On the surface, the argument you just made seems like an easy one; if a government needs the consent of anyone to do anything to them, then they can't do anything to criminals right?

There are a lot of people who find Abortion to be deeply immoral. IF they forcibly keep somebody from having an abortion or keep an abortion doctor from performing one, we arrest them. \n \n That is the point of government. First, governments do not have rights. They have powers. In representative governments they have powers delegated to them by the people. Their primary power, though, the only one that gives them \"teeth\" is that the people give them a monopoly on the use of force. That is specifically to avoid what you would seem to think is the ideal society..where people run around acting on illogical and ever shifting morals. \n \n \nThis of course makes it very very easy for someone like myself to evaluate the actions of a government. I do so on the exact same standard as I evaluate any person including myself.\n\n \n So it is an evaluation that means nothing at all to anybody but you, or the 3 other people out there that share your morals. \n \n \n\n If you are asking for support could you be more specific about the premise you do not agree with.\n\n \n I dont care enough to ask for clarification. What you posted was illogical gibbirish that nobody of even below average intelligence is going to take seriously. That is why I say that if you have a logical position, you need to state it. IF your posts have a POINT, it makes them MUCH more interesting for the reader.\n \n \n \nAd Hominem\n\n \n Constructive criticism.\n \n \n \nYou asked for this before, did you not follow my link? There is also many posts after the OP that give more detail.\n\n \n You mean the link that features more of your ridiculous gibberish? Yes. I perused that nonsense as well. \n \n \n \nMost people don't even have the concept of an absolute morality besides one that came from religion, so I would have to agree with that.\n \n However many many people share my values, even if they haven't gone through the logic that would allow them to discover the true morality.\n \n\n \n ROTFLMAO. You are one of the most illogical posters I have ever had the misfortune of crossing paths with. \n \n Your position is NOT logical. That has been demonstrated. The entire concept of absolute morality is NOT LOGICAL. That also has been demonstrated. The very idea is nonsense. \n \n \nHere is a question, if I went to pre-civil war south and asked just about anyone if slavery was wrong (even slaves) how many would say it was do you think?\n \n In that time and in that place not many people would agree with my morals either. Should I then conclude that I have just gone insane somewhere along the line, that I am way off base and that slavery is at least a-moral if not moral?\n \n I think not, it is easy for someone in your mindset to denounce something like slavery as everyone you meet already agrees that it is a theft of life, liberty, and happiness. It takes someone in my mindset to denounce based on something more reasonable and objective than public opinion polls.\n\n \n NO, I dont. In fact, I think that in many cases slavery is the MORAL choice, even TODAY. Many of my dearest friends have rounded up people and sold them into slavery. I have no problem with it whatsoever.\n \n This is where your \"absolute morals\" things falls apart. Most of the slavery you see today is in war torn african countries. The thing is you get these rebel uprisings. Many of these rebels do horrible, horrible things. So you send in your military and hire mercenaries to go in and put down the uprising. They do so. The problem is that now you have tens of thousands of rebels as prisoners. Turning them loose is not an option, if you do they will be back butchering your population by the end of the week. You cannot afford to keep tens of thousands of people in prison because you just spent all your money putting down the rebel uprising. So what do you do with them? The INTELLIGENT thing would be to get a half dozen D9s, dig some big trenches, fill them with their dead bodies, and then cover them back up.\n \n There are 2 problems with this. First, if the international community finds out, you are screwed. Sanctions, investigations, war crimes trials. It is a total mess. Second, nobody ever wants to be the guy to give the order to execute tens of thousands of people. It leads to problems sleeping at night.\n \n So what do you do? You start diverting prisoners off to slave markets. You brand them, sell them off. You essentially use your population as jailers, and they pay you for the privilege, which helps cover the cost of the expensive war you just fought. It also lets you use them productively as opposed to making them rot in a prison or turn them into fertilizer. \n \n I have absolutely no problem with slavery under those conditions. It is not just the intelligent decision, it is the most moral decision you can make in those circumstances. \n \n Now, going down the road and kidnapping my neighbors wife and enslave her, that would, by my way of thinking, be completely immoral. \n \n \n\n I call them 'my morals' for convenience, they are universal. Why should society chance to accept my morals? It shouldn't.

   "No, you didnt. You went off on a strange little anarchist tangent about how the government must have the consent of each individual that the govern. \n\n I explained that society is a sum, not a whole.\n \n\n Morality is not based on logic. At all. In most cases morals are based on empathy...emotion...which is not logical. \n\n Morality is based on logic. The idea that morality is the bleed off of people's emotional whims is exactly what I am fighting against.\n \n I don't want to hear some foolish attempt to argue by definition in which you define morality as your feelings and therefore it can't be based on logic.\n \n Moral - of, pertaining to, or concerned with the principles or rules of right conduct or the distinction between right and wrong; ethical: moral attitudes. \n \n \nAgain, based on whose morals?\n\n Again, based on the morals.\n \n \nThere are a lot of people who find Abortion to be deeply immoral. IF they forcibly keep somebody from having an abortion or keep an abortion doctor from performing one, we arrest them. \n\n Appeal to force\n \n \nIn representative governments they have powers delegated to them by the people. Their primary power, though, the only one that gives them \"teeth\" is that the people give them a monopoly on the use of force. \n \n Anyone who would be willing to defend themselves has not abdicated their right of self-defense, I certainly haven't. I would pay a government to do it a hundred times better than me but I would never count on them being at the right time at the right place all the time by promising to never defend myself.\n \n Governments have rights just as companies and individuals do. Calling them powers seems to be semantics to me unless you are noting the contradictions in assuming the government is always right in what it does.\n \n \nThat is specifically to avoid what you would seem to think is the ideal society..where people run around acting on illogical and ever shifting morals.\n \n What part about absolute objective morality translates in your mind to evershifiting and illogical?\n \n \nSo it is an evaluation that means nothing at all to anybody but you, or the 3 other people out there that share your morals. \n\n It means something to anyone who holds an that an objective morality exists, and everyone ought to believe it does and work to know what it is.\n \n \nI dont care enough to ask for clarification. What you posted was illogical gibbirish that nobody of even below average intelligence is going to take seriously. \n\n Argument by dismissal\n \n Ad hominem\n \n \nYou mean the link that features more of your ridiculous gibberish? Yes. I perused that nonsense as well. \n \n Then your questions about 'what is this morality of yours' were purely rhetorical.\n \n \n \nROTFLMAO. You are one of the most illogical posters I have ever had the misfortune of crossing paths with. \n \n Your position is NOT logical. That has been demonstrated. The entire concept of absolute morality is NOT LOGICAL. That also has been demonstrated. The very idea is nonsense. \n\n Argument by dismissal\n \n \nNO, I dont. In fact, I think that in many cases slavery is the MORAL choice, even TODAY. Many of my dearest friends have rounded up people and sold them into slavery. I have no problem with it whatsoever.\n\n I see, than you can add that to your list of objectively immoral beliefs. Shall I find another example? If you object to anything at all I am pretty sure I can find some example where it was common practice and considered a-moral or moral.\n \n \nThis is where your \"absolute morals\" things falls apart.\n\n Where men believe that the immoral is moral? It seems that is where their understanding of absolute morals falls apart.\n \n pi doesn't change because you can find someone who thinks it's 24.3\n \n \nMost of the slavery you see today is in war torn african countries. The thing is you get these rebel uprisings. Many of these rebels do horrible, horrible things. So you send in your military and hire mercenaries to go in and put down the uprising. They do so. The problem is that now you have tens of thousands of rebels as prisoners. Turning them loose is not an option, if you do they will be back butchering your population by the end of the week. You cannot afford to keep tens of thousands of people in prison because you just spent all your money putting down the rebel uprising. So what do you do with them? The INTELLIGENT thing would be to get a half dozen D9s, dig some big trenches, fill them with their dead bodies, and then cover them back up.\n \n There are 2 problems with this. First, if the international community finds out, you are screwed. Sanctions, investigations, war crimes trials. It is a total mess. Second, nobody ever wants to be the guy to give the order to execute tens of thousands of people. It leads to problems sleeping at night.\n \n So what do you do? You start diverting prisoners off to slave markets. You brand them, sell them off. You essentially use your population as jailers, and they pay you for the privilege, which helps cover the cost of the expensive war you just fought. It also lets you use them productively as opposed to making them rot in a prison or turn them into fertilizer. \n \n I have absolutely no problem with slavery under those conditions. It is not just the intelligent decision, it is the most moral decision you can make in those circumstances. \n \n Now, going down the road and kidnapping my neighbors wife and enslave her, that would, by my way of thinking, be completely immoral. \n\n Why do you think that is immoral but not the 'enslavement' of prisoners?\n \n What you call slavery I would call prison labor, albeit without a prison. I am not claiming there are objective punishments. There would have to be a standard of judgement and it would have to be the same for all however.\n \n \nNO, they are your morals. They are personal to you. They are not the inevitable product of logic. \n\n YES they are universal morals. They are the inevitable product of logic.\n \n \nThe problem with claiming that they are the inevitable product of logic, and that disagreeing with them is the result of a logical error is that all logic is based first and foremost on knowledge. People working from different knowledge bases are typically going to draw different logical conclusions. Their conclusions are typically no less logical than your own.\n \n Of course logic operates on premises, the premises required exist in all mentally sound humans.\n \n \nI am going to be honest. This is what actually bugs me about your posts. They are just dripping with arrogance, and yet are incredibly simpleminded. It is unusual to see such intellectual arrogance in somebody so simpleminded. I think maybe your mom called you \"her little genius\" once too often. \n \n Arrogance for advocating the idea that objective truth exists where you do not think it does, simpleminded because I can define objects where you see only haze and assume it is some sort of mystical complexity no one can grasp.\n \n Does it take arrogance to propose that the earth revolves around the sun, that the pythagorean theorem is true, that plants are green, or that there is nitrogen in the air?\n \n Apparently it does if you are accused of believing those things based on some appeal to personal authority.\n \n Do you realize every good scientific theory provides simple principles to explain phenomenon sometimes incredibly complex?\n \n How simple minded to reduce this huge complicated world to something as simple as 100 elements bonding with each other and flying around! What kind of simpleton would suggest that?\n \n Oh and ad hominem\n \nThe rest of your post I deleted. It was just more simple minded gibberish that requires acceptance of your morals to make sense, and your morals are silly.\n\n Gosh, I never thought of that! If only I knew that 'my morals' were silly I would never have bothered to tell you about them.\n \n Ad hominem, and since you are obviously building up to it can we skip straight to the part where you quit; doesn't take much effort to identify the increasing tide of informal fallacies but I am thinking more about you and how foolish it looks.",
