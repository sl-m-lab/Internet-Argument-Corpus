   "First thing I want to say is that I dont want to offend anyone but for me abortion was the best option. I also want to say that I love Christ will all my heart. He has forgiven me for my sins and because ive had an abortion does not mean im not a Christian and yes I was a christian when I did have an abortion. I had an abortion just this past june. Not using this as an excuse but my mom passed away last year. Ive felt really alone ever since. I felt abandoned by everyone which is why I fell into a relationship that I knew I shouldnt have. NOT condoning it but Im just saying the reasons why it was easier for me at that time to fall into a negative relationship. He was very jealous and insecure and ended up being abusive in the end. I ended up having to get a temporary restraining order against him but anyways I had the abortion because for one I was out of work. I had no way to take care of the child. I knew I didnt want to deal with that guy forever. My life wouldve been OVER if I had to raise a baby with him and he did want me to keep it. I am fine with adoption but he wouldnt let me do it and his mom kept trying to convince me to have the baby and give it to him but theres no way Id trust him with my baby. \n \n Also I got the abortion as early as I possibly could. They wont even take u for surgical abortions below 6 weeks and I was 6 weeks and two days. I had the ultra sound and there was no baby yet. There wasnt even a fetus. It was like a grain of salt honestly. It was a spec that hadnt developed into anything. There was no fetal tissue coming out of me when he did the abortion. I grew up in a christian home and was anti abortion most of my life but honestly I felt so relieved after having the abortion. So many pro life activists try to tell you that women who have abortion live with horrible guilt forever but there is no one ive met with that experience. I dont feel that abortion is murder because I think murder is taking a life. I think abortion is stopping a life before it begins which I do feel is a sin in its own right in most cases but I think God forgives and can understand and I think because you make a mistake, doesnt mean you shouldnt have a second chance. Id rather die than have to deal with that guy the rest of my life. Id never be free of him otherwise. He was a complete psycho! and no its not that simple just to take someone to court and get full custody. Judges arent always fair. I know that from what my mom went thru with my father and also the judge chose not to extend the restraining order I had against him because the judge believed his lies and he even called me after the court appearance and admitted to perjury!\n \n Abortion seems to be the only sin alot of christians talk about which is why I sometimes wonder why I dont feel so bad about it but I just dont. I am in prayer everyday. I do love the Lord and still have sought forgiveness for it but I just cant regret it. I have a new lease on life. It hadnt even developed into a baby yet.I still think I was careless and it was a sin but I cant imagine having to raise a baby with that guy. My life would be over. What I do regret is the whole situation period. I regret the fornication that led up to the pregnancy. I think alot of christians scare people away from Christ with calling abortion murder as well as other things. Im not saying if you think its wrong, you shouldnt say that but have compassion for people because we all fall short of the glory of God. We have ALL sinned. Most christians im sure have fornicated(even ones who repented and decided to save themselves later) and in some situations, I just dont feel its best to have the child.\n \n Also what about people that have been raped? You still would say thats murder even if a father raped a 12 year old girl? U'd expect her to have that baby. I saw a woman on oprah who had a baby when she was 14 by her father! Her daughter/sister is an adult and she had so many health problems. She also looked deformed, not saying that she would be better off dead but you cant even understand a case like that and see how God can understand that?",

I think I really needed to hear that today because otherwise Id probably be thinking about it the whole night and feeling guilty for not feeling guilty. I guess what I do not want people to think is that I didnt love the Lord when I did have the abortion or that I wasnt truly saved because I know that I was and still am. It was kind of hard even writing the post. The only person in my family that knows I had an abortion is my aunt. I knew I could tell her because she seems to be a little bit more liberal than the rest of my family. I am 24 years old but I think alot of my family would even be shocked to know that I was having sex period. I feel relieved to just say Ive had an abortion even just on the net on a forum that seems to be mostly christian.",

If the Bible advises that abortion is murder, then it is so regardless of what the secular systems of the day have to say about it.\n\n \n Murder is a legal term. Where it appears in the bible, it refers to the laws of the land the reader may find himself in. In a land where canabilism is legal and practiced, then killing and eating a person is not murder, and none of the rules of the bible pertaining to murder would have been broken by doing so.\n \n \nWhen talking with one accepting the principles of Christianity, the premiere of those being that the Bible is binding, the existence of the soul is not up for debate.\n\n \n Idiocy. There is no reason to believe the soul exists without evidence to the contrary. The bible is not sufficient evidence. Believing it is true does not make it so.\n \n \nThe position of Bassman, I believe, would be that there is no legitimate right to terminate a pregnancy, especially from the stand-point of the Bible, which of course, is binding to those professing Christianity.\n\n \n I don't believe deliberately terminating a pregnancy is addressed at all in the bible. Perhaps killing is, and there may be some inference from other related texts on the value of life. However, the woman is not killing the baby when she terminates the pregnancy. She is simply choosing not to support another person against her will. That the baby dies as a result is inavoidable, but not covered by the bible.\n \n If one would insist it is covered by the bible, then one must campaign just as strongly against allowing any behaviour which would mean that people might die. For example: When people are playing football, they are not providing support for people who may die as a result. When people watch television, they are not providing support for other people who may die as a result. When people play with their children, they are not providing support for people who may die as a result.\n \n The same principle applies across the board, or not at all: If you do not provide support for someone, and as a result they die, then you murdered them. You cannot say \"This thing (denying provision of support) is murder in this case, but not any other cases.\"",

You completely disagree with typical Christian sentiments on abortion, you feel none of the purported guilt the religious movement implies is inevitable, you feel like you did the right thing, so why would you continue to profess to belong to this religion if you disagree with one of the major issues of the day?\n\n i dont think that there is such a thing as a \"typical\" christian sentiment about abortion. there are many christians that are split about the issue, and many that believe they have the right to choose. and i dont think having an abortion is grounds to completely reject one's religion, especially if your religion also preaches forgiveness and repentance. christianity preaches that abortion is a sin, as is murder, adultery, stealing and lying. but it also, and more significantly, teaches that sinning does not terminate your christianity. even a premeditated sin can be forgiven, as long as the person deeply regrets and repents of the action, and makes a vow to not do so again. i think that is the point caramel is making",

   "I am a christian. I love Jesus with all my heart. NO ONE can tell me differently. I understand how both sides can think what they think. EVERYONE has sinned and everyone falls short of the glory of God. Even after you become a christian, you will still sin at some point and if you repent God forgives you. I have already asked God for forgiveness and he has forgiven me. I feel at peace about it because it is behind me and God has forgiven me. Feeling guilty about something I cant change is a waste of this life that God has given me. I am not the only christian thats had an abortion and not the only one that doesn't regret it. I was playing with fire by sleeping with that guy in the first place and I believe that if something like that didnt happen, I still would be today. He is out of my life for good and he wouldnt be if I hadnt of had an abortion. I could be here all day telling u of all the instances with him that scared me to death and why I ended up having to get a temporary order of protection against him .\n \n I was never against putting the baby up for adoption but he was and said what he would do if I tried to put his baby up for adoption and theres no way Id give my baby to someone like him to raise. I honestly wonder if I wouldve been able to carry the baby to term anyway because he did everything possible to hurt me even while I was pregnant. I really wanted to die. I am a christian and do love the Lord and other christians opinions of what I did doesnt determine whether I am a christian or not. I feel the Holy spirit with me. It was NOT an easy thing for me to do. There were protestors outside yelling things as soon as I got out of the car. I stayed there for hours and it was really nerve wrecking but the staff was amazing. No one ever said abortion was a good thing even the staff at the abortion clinic but for me, whether people can understand that or not, I feel it was nessacary. I was very careless in sleeping with him. I regret the whole situation period that led up to me having to make that choice but it gives me chills to think what my life would be like if I hadnt have had that abortion. I have even apologized to the Lord if its a sin that I dont feel guilty. \n \n I know alot of christians that support the death penalty. Most republican christians sure do and that is taking a life whether the person is a murderer or not but see most christians dont see that as murder because it is the law just like in the bible even in the new testament, it was never against the law and its not against the law in this country but yet abortion is considered murder to christians but the death penalty isnt murder?",

Its hard to feel totally one way about it when I see sermons everyday on tbn or other christians saying that abortion under any circumstance is a sin so when its constantly thrown in my face then yes I ask God for forgiveness and have asked God to forgive me for not feeling guilty about it because everyone thinks that I should. I am a strong person that will do what I feel is best despite the popular opinion but I see so many people of the same faith saying its horrible and thats hard not to let that influence me. It is normal to question yourself when everyone else is against you. That is why I have asked God for forgiveness. I dont know about you guys but sometimes I am not always right even when I think I am and what matters most is what God thinks so everytime I ask God for forgiveness, I not only ask him to forgive me for sins that I know are sins but also things that I may not know were sins. Thats just me. Im not perfect. And of course I wont do it again. I just wont put myself in the same situation. It was a mistake to be with that type of person to begin with.

While I can certainly emphasize with caramelbeauty81's situation, she made several statements that demonstrate that she isn't truly repentant. She chose a pragmatic solution over the moral one. Knowingly sinning and thinking that a token act of contrition is an \"ace in the hole\" won't get one through the Pearly Gates. \n I hope that she makes better choices in the future. Life is too precious to be so cavalier about taking it. I'm reminded of the story of Solomon. When two women came before him, both claiming to be a baby's mother, Solomon threatened to split the baby in half and give each woman 1/2 of the baby. One woman was prepared to accept the judgemnet while the other begged Solomon to give the baby to the other woman so that it wouldn't be killed. Solomon recognized her as being the true mother because she would rather see someone else raise her child than have it killed. Think about it.",

As I said earlier, anyone who accepts the tenets of Christianity, accepts that the human soul exists. You may not like that, you may find it silly, you may think anyone who does so is stupid, silly, childish, or otherwise, but regardless of how you feel about the matter, a Christian believes in the existence of the soul. You accept science as your absolute. Bassman accepts the Bible.

In fact, abortion was generally not illegal until the latter half of the 1800s, when many states enacted laws criminalizing the procedure.\n Many states have recently enacted fetal homicide laws, which create a separate crime for actions taken against a woman that result in the death of - or harm to - her fetus. These laws treat the fetus as an individual, apart from the woman. Some of these laws do not contain exceptions for the woman or her doctor, which could possibly allow criminal proceedings for measures taken as a course of treatment (radiation treatment for cancer or antibiotics) or for abortion.\n \n On the federal level, in 1999 the Unborn Victims of Violence Act (which does contain exceptions for the woman, her doctor, and abortion) was proposed and passed the House of Representatives. \n \n These states have fetal homicide laws where fetuses are victims at any stage of development:\n \n \n AZ\n ID\n IL\n LA\n MI\n MN\n MO\n ND\n NE\n ND\n OH\n PA\n SD\n UT\n WI\n These states have fetal homicide laws where fetuses are victims at only specific stages in development:\n \n \n AR\n CA\n FL\n GA\n MA\n MS\n NV\n OK\n RI\n SC\n TN\n WA\n The following states criminalize certain conduct that terminates pregnancies or causes miscarriages:\n \n \n IA\n IN\n KS\n NC\n NH\n NM\n VA\n http://womensissues.about.com/cs/parentingfamily/a/aafetalhomicide.htm\n \n",

I have tried to decide how one would infer that from what I said, but I haven't found a connection. What I did in my post in #58 was to adopt your reasoning in #57 and show what I thought to be an obvious absurdity. You offered the following three facts: 1) Abortion is not considered murder in the United States, 2) The Old Testament does not say abortion is murder, and 3) the Gospels do not say aboriton is murder. The conclusion you drew from that was \"Those who believe abortion to be murder stand in opposition to the Country, Judaic Law, and the words of Jesus Christ (you revised this a bit, but my reply came before your revision). You then added that, to you, this seemed like a fringe cult, that is, the belief that abortion is murder. Fair enough, you're entitled to that. However, In an effort to demonstrate that your conclusion does not follow from the reasoning, I introduced a counterexample in #58, which took the exact line of reasoning, and then I suggested that if someone who believes murder is abortion is guilty of cult-like beliefs for the reasons you stated, then so must have been any abolitionist in the 1860s, since any such abolitionist would fit the criteria you established. What should have been inferred from what I said is not that abortion and slavery are analogous (though again, I have suggested this numerous times in other posts), but that an effort to have abortion recognized as murder, and therefore outlawed, is no more the product of cultish beliefs than was the effort have slavery recognized as immoral, and therefore outlawed in the 1860s was. That should clear up my original post in #58, I think.\n \n Enter the strawman. \n \n \nYou are also correct that human slavery as well as indentured servitude are presently illegal in the US. Forcing a woman into compulsory gestation for months, a mandatory labor and a requisite birthing process is illegal as well. But in service to your personal beliefs I guess you think that it is acceptable.\n\n First, I never said nor implied that human slavery as well indentured slavery was presently illegal in the United States. This interesting fact is true, however, I never said as much nor implied as much in my response to you. \n \n Second, you presented that misrepresentation as my initial position when you said \"You are also correct...\" This was not what I said, as I have pointed out above. Your statement is true except for the part that presents as fact that I said what you said I said, which I did not.\n \n Third, with the misrepresentation complete, you respond to something I did not say. My claim was that a belief that aboriton is murder does not equivocate to a cultish belief. The problem, of course, isn't that you responded to something I did not say. The problem is that you responded to what I did not say, all the while suggesting that you were replying to what I did say.\n \n To summarize:\n \n You advanced the claim that the point of my post in #58 was to analogize abortion with slavery, which is not the case. You then responded to that analogy as if I had made it, when in fact I did not.\n \n \nAs I said the post was in response to Bassman with whom I have running discourses on various subject. The cult reference is an ongoing thing between Bassman, EZ and me - when I go too far in his opinion or EZ's they say I'm a member of a cult. When I think they go too far, I return the favor. It may be childish, but then none of us is perfect.\n\n Ok, that's fine. But I still think your use of a universal statement to get this point across is confusing at best.\n \n \nYou accuse me of erecting straw men, but don't demonstrate it. You toss words around like childish - with an attitude that seems like you have a bone to pick with me about something, but you never really come out and say what it is.\n\n \n \nFinally, if you notice, I try my best to quote what you say in context. I'd appreciate it if you would do the same.\n\n hmmm. You accuse me of qouting out of context, but don't demonstrate it.\n \n And now, for the question that I think started this gigantic misunderstanding.\n \n Do you believe that the the belief that abortion is murder is a cultish belief? That should be fairly clear and unambiguous I think. You don't really need to explain the earlier reference.",

   "Do you believe that the the belief that abortion is murder is a cultish belief?\n\n \n I am sure that there are people who believe that abortion is murder who also belong to cults. I also am sure that there are people who believe that abortion is murder who are not members of a cult. The same is true for pro-choice proponents. That is why I specifically used the terminology \"Seems... to me\".\n \n My post was a response to Bassman and my comment to him \"seems like a fringe cult to me\" was not a reference to one single belief, it was a much more complex issue I was addressing -- one that he and I and others have been addressing for months. You have not been part of that particular discourse so it is understandable that you do not know the context some statements are made in. You cannot take one post to Bassman out of the context of the dozens of posts between us.\n \n The word \"cult\" refers to religious beliefs and that is how I was using it. Here is the definition of cult.\n \n aol://4344:1708.D0016503.40124537.672502708\n \n I have said I was sorry if you took it personally (twice - post 68 & 77), I have said I was sorry if you misunderstood it (post 62). I am now sorry if that is not good enough for you.\n \n Because you do not fully understand the context, I will trust that the rest of your post was not meant to be as scurrilous as it seems.",

Many are recently enacted laws that probably haven't been enforced against abortions because the \"time\" wasn't right.\n \n In PA, the law has been challenged on the basis of Roe v Wade and was upheld.\n \n\n Pennsylvania: An individual commits criminal homicide in the first, second, or third-degree, or voluntary manslaughter of an \"unborn child\" if the individual intentionally, knowingly, recklessly or negligently causes the death of an unborn child. 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 2601 to 2609 (1997) \"Unborn child\" and \"fetus.\" Each term shall mean an individual organism of the species Homo sapiens from fertilization until live birth.\" On January 14, 2005, the Superior Court of Pennsylvania -- an intermediate court of appeals -- rejected an array of constitutional challenges to this law, including assertions based on Roe v. Wade and equal protection principles. The court upheld the application of the law \"from the moment of fertilization,\" holding that \"the viability of the fetus, that is, its likelihood of survival outside of the mother's body, is irrelevant.\" Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v.
