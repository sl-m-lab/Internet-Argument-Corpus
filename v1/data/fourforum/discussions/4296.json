Planets and stars formed from space dust.\n 3. Matter created life by itself.\n 4. Early life-forms learned to reproduce themselves.\n 5.

You're right, the Bible hasn't changed, despite the fact that it's science has been proven wrong.\n And that's why we can't use the Bible as a science book.\n The earth isn't flat, the sky isn't a bowel over our heads, there never was a world wide flood, the earth is 4.5 billion years old and all life did evolve. It's amazing how some people can believe the 4000 year old myths of primitive goat herders over modern science!\n \n \nColumbus went against 99.9% of all people that demonstrated the world was flat. Turns out 99.9% of them were wrong.\n \n \n Good point! And that belief was propagated by Christians who claimed the Bible was inerrant, ignoring the scientific evidence! Yes, I do see the pattern. Sometimes brave individuals must break with Christianity when it comes to science because when christianity has made scientific claims based on the Bible they have always been wrong! Let's also mention that it was Christian geologists 200 years ago who made the realization that there could never have been a world wide flood and that the earth was MUCH older than 6,000 years. Once again, brave individuals not giving into the church and standing by the facts.",

   "I simply am stating that the theory of evolution is as much of a religion as the theory of creation. First of all, evolution is not observable, nor is there any measurable evidence. Thats why Dr. Hovind is not a piece of scum. He is pointing out the truth, that it cannot be considered science, because it cannot be demonstrated as other science can. Isn't evolution 100% faith based as well? thats my very point.\n\n \n No, you just contradicted yourself.\n The theory of evolution is a theory. Religion is religion. Two mutually exclusive terms. Theories require rational justification, religion does not. \n \n A scientific theory requires a hypothesis to stand the rigours of scientific inquiry, all proof must support the hypothesis, and no evidence can contradict it. Such is the case with evolution. Evolution..i..e change in organisms, is a fact. Evolution as the explanation for how humans came to be from other life forms, is a proven theory.\n \n On the contrary, creation is not. Creation has no evidence to support it, does not explain all the evidence that does support evolution, and has not stood up to rigorous scientific inquiry as a reasonable solution to a real life problem. It fails, ultimately because it's being pushed by religious people who base beliefs on faith, not reality. That is, they base beliefs on nothing, vs something.\n \n Every time a human mates and produces offspring that literally are completely different beings, they display evidence of what we term \"evolution\". Every tree that grows, every bacteria that mutates, all display evolution...i.e. change. There is nothing in living organisms that does not fit within the bounds of evolution. There is nothing observed in living organisms that supports creation (actually, nothing anywhere).\n \n Evolution is demonsrated every second of every day. All observable evidence supports evolution. If you aren't aware of the evidence, you are either incable of reading/hearing, ignorant, or dishonest.\n \n One of countless examples of every day use of controlled change of living matter:\n http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/01/6/text_pop/l_016_06.html\n \n I realize someone, or the bible, entices you to believe otherwise, but they are either ignorant, or dishonest, or both. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BE.\n \n -Mach",

This debate put the biblical truth of the heavens rotating the earth on the line against an empirical viewpoint. Ultimately, the church admitted its mistake but the damage had been done (and I'm not talking about the treatment of Gallileo here)- the biblical absolute had been shown to be quite untrue.\n \n Therin lies the danger of using the word of the Bible to define an understanding of our physical reality. Use the right tool for the job in hand- to make an analogy, you wouldn't use a screwdriver to saw wood ;)\n \n Oh, an hi all, its been a while since I was last here emoticon_idea",

   "your answers are not very convincing with no specific examples. Im just getting a bunch of simple yes or no responses. \n\n \n Obviously you haven't read them. the responses given, a few of them especially specifically note why Dr. Fraud's argument doesn't fly. Simply because you are either too lazy to read them, or are too ignorant to understand them doesn't make them yes or no responses. \n \n \nthere has been just as much proof supporting creation as there has evolution. No creature has evolved.\n\n \n There isn't a single piece of evidence for creation, but truckloads for evolution. Creatures HAVE evolved. Horses for instance, we have the entire, unbroken evolutionary chain of horses, from dog-sized to modern day. Every minute change is noted in the geological record. Not to mention that we've seen evolution in specific places over 50 years. For instance, Hawaii. On the biggest island, volanic eruptions leave small areas of forest isolated from each other. Over the past 50 years, several new species of fruit flies have evolved in isolation. They no longer mate with other species, and have phenotypical traits that differ to a significent degree. By all means, they have evolved. \n \n \nGenesis 1 states that every creature was given the ability to reproduce after its own kind.\n\n \n So? Genesis cannot be proven in the slightest. \n \n \nHave you ever seen an animal reproduce another kind? No.\n\n \n Fallacy: Straw Man (Fallacy Of Extension)\n \n \nattacking an exaggerated or caricatured version of your opponent's position. \n For example, the claim that \"evolution means a dog giving birth to a cat.\"\n \n \n A animal cannot produce a new, very different species with a single birth. No one has ever stated that in support of evolution. And, actually, yes, I have see an animal reproduce another kind: instance, Horse giving birth to a rare type of Zebra through cloning. :) \n \n \nAdam and Eve. DNA study has finally caught up to this truth and found a common gene that would suggest this.\n\n \n No not really. If that was true, then we;d all be dead. Adam and Eve would have to populate the world through incest. We all know what occurs with long term incest, and given even a meager 7,000 years, we'd all be dead from compounded dieases, viruses, enviromental weakness...etc, etc etc. Besides, if Adam and Eve were the first parents, and somehow we survived, there would be no significent phenotypical or genotypical variantions, as all of the genes would be the same, and we'd simply be mixing around two sets of DNA. \n \n \n\n It makes more sense to believe in a devine creator, then to believe that every kind of living thing evolved from one another.\n\n \n Because... \n \n \n\n I hope you dont believe everything that is written in a textbook that has been changed over and over. The Bible never has.\n\n \n Actually the Bible has changed, not to mention had omissions. \n \n \n\n Columbus went against 99.9% of all people that demonstrated the world was flat. Turns out 99.9% of them were wrong.\n\n \n Most of the educated world by the 1700s knew the world was round. Even the people who funded his expedition. The reason he ran into opposition was because Portugal's monarch knew that Columbus was working off of wrong maps. Isabella and Ferdinand weren't as privilaged to have accurate cartographers and were suckered into Columbus's promise of spices and metal wealth.",
