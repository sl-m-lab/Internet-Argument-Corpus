   "Yup, The Deulfer report selectively forgot to include one company implicated in the UN oil-for-food scandal. Yup, you guessed it, Halliburton. That silly Halliburton, if it's not illegally dealing with Iran and Lybia while under sanctions it's dealing with Iraq while under sanctions.\n \n Well, tell me what you think about this article:\n \n http://www.onlinejournal.com/Special_Reports/101604Leopold/101604leopold.html\n \n \nBut the one company that helped Saddam exploit the oil-for-food program in the mid-1990s that wasn't identified in Duelfer's report was Halliburton, and the person at the helm of Halliburton at the time of the scheme was Dick Cheney. Halliburton and its subsidiaries were one of several American and foreign oil supply companies that helped Iraq increase its crude exports from $4 billion in 1997 to nearly $18 billion in 2000 by skirting U.S. laws and selling Iraq spare parts so it could repair its oil fields and pump more oil. \n \n \n http://www.johnmccrory.com/wrote.asp?this=452\n \nWith every one of his 30-odd justifications for the Iraq war in tatters, George W. Bush and his veep are now trying to claim the corruption of the United Nations Oil-for-food program is reason enough to invade. Indeed, for months, Republicans and President Bush have been obsessed with the corruption of the Oil-for-Food program as a means for bashing former allies like France and the UN in general. What they don't want to trumpet is the names of American individuals and corporations that were similarly engaged in bribes and illicit trade with Saddam Hussein's Iraq. One can imagine that if Dick Cheney were one of those individuals, there would be a lot of pressure to keep that secret.\n \n According to an oil industry trade publication, \"Under the United Nations oil-for-food program, ExxonMobil, ChevronTexaco and Valero, an independent refining company, were among the biggest American buyers of Iraqi oil through international traders.\" \n \n Of course, since the names of the Americans and American companies that Duelfer's survey team found were involved in the oil-for-food corruption have been kept classified, we have no idea who else might have been involved. Need we ask whether Dick Cheney, Halliburton, and its subsidiaries were whited-out or blacked-out of Duelfer's report? \n \n\n \n http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A16201-2004Oct7.html\n \nThe names on the politically explosive list are French, Russian, Chinese, Canadian and Japanese; if Duelfer had had his way, U.S. companies and individuals would have been included, too.\n But he was overruled by CIA lawyers.\n\n \n \n http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2004/10/08/us_probes_illicit_sales_to_hussein/\n \n''There are Americans involved,\" said David Kay, who oversaw the CIA's search for weapons of mass destruction and investigation of Iraq's black market arms network until last December. ''The cases are undergoing legal review, and it is actionable,\" he said in an interview yesterday, declining to elaborate.\n \n Separately, a House government reform subcommittee is also investigating the UN oil-for-food program, including the Bush administration's handling of the funds after it set up the Coalition Provisional Authority to oversee the Iraq occupation. The interim Iraqi government, too, is in the midst of its own inquiry\n\n \n http://www.truthout.org/docs_01/02.03E.Hallib.Iraq.htm\n \n \n So, it looks like the US, if not the Vice President himself, was involved in the oil-for-food scam. We don't like to talk about US involvement, but we do like to talk about French and Russian involvement a lot. We also don't like to talk about the $9 billion that is just \"missing.\" I'll bet there was a lot of \"missing\" money in Iraq under Saddam. Maybe it's not Saddam's fault afterall. Maybe there's just a some kind of cosmic convergence in Iraq that causes billions of dollars to vanish! Yeah, we sure are bringing them democracy and freedom alright!",
