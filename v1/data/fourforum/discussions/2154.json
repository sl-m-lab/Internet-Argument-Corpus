And it even seems wrong for a woman to say, \"Surprise, I'm pregnant, and I'm keeping the baby, and you'll have no part in it.\" The guy may be able to get a court to order visitation rights, but there is no way the man can be deeply involved in the life of his child without the mother agreeing. \n \n Of course, you can argue that the man is to blame for his predicament; if he doesn't want to lose control over whether babies will be born or aborted, then don't have sex with the woman. This is a valid point, but the plain fact is that he and the woman both had a say over having sex, but only the woman has say about whether she will abort the baby or not.

   "Then you must know a lot of nefarious characters. My wife doesn't run around my neighborhood paranoid over being raped and I doubt that many others on this board do, either. So, it's logical to assume that you must live in a rough area or have questionable associations.\n \n \n Hum, let's see. You married an abuser, were raped and you let your hormones get the better of you on occasion, but you don't trust men like me.\n Men like me........I'm 48, have been married to the same woman for 26 years, never cheated on her, never raised a hand to her in anger, have three adult children, all top in their academic classes, moral and respectful of others.\n Yep, you shouldn't trust men like me. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n It appears that your moral compass is broken. I'm not the enemy. \n I truly feel sorry for you. You are so filled with hatred towards men that you have blinded yourself to the fact that not all men are bad and I fear that you wouldn't be able to recognize a good man if you encountered one. What kind of atmosphere is that to raise a son in? Have you imprinted your paranoia onto your son? It's important for him to know what is proper male behavior by having a good example. Do you, at least, have ONE male role model for him to emmulate?\n \n Don't feel the need to respond to my above \"soapbox session\" in this forum unless you're comfortable doing so. I would rather that you think about what I wrote than worry about a good comeback.\n\n \n First of all, I need to point out to you that you are practicing revictimization here. It's the idea that the victim did something to deserve an attack (location, acquaintances, etc.). The truth about rape is that one in three woman will be raped. One third of us - and the attacker is usually someone the victim knows and trusts. I assure you, I am not more worried about rape than reality dictates.\n \n Secondly, I don't hate men. That's ridiculous. The two people I trust most in the world are my mother and my son's male mentor/father. One of my two best friends is a guy. My social circle revolves around the music scene - which is a whole lotta guys. I love guys. They are cute as heck and taste just like chicken. \n \n There is no question that my negative experiences have fueled my desire to be independent. My son is ten. I am 35. I have a roaming spirit. I honest injun don't want more kids. I don't want to get married, start another family and live a quiet life in the burbs. When my son goes to college I plan to sell my house, move to Toronto and focus more on music. That isn't me hating men, that's just what I want. So my life doesn't have a lot of romance and when it does, it's pretty easy on the head - that is by choice, not a sad product of my life. \n \n Personal freedom, independence and choice are absolutely critical to me. It's not that I don't trust you as an individual, I don't trust you to see that, to even understand that. So based on that, and the course I was planning for my future, I decided to get my tubes tied.\n \n You have yet to address what I have brought up twice. Why do conservative men have a problem with me having done this? It was an informed, adult choice. I hurt nobody. Is there some underlying idea that I am supposed to keep my bodily resources available for men? Max once asked me what if I did meet the right guy. I actually think that would be fabulous, but considering what I want in life, the right guy for me won't want children (or young children anyway).",

I assure you, I am not more worried about rape than reality dictates.\n\n I guess my words may have come off that way, but it wasn't my intent.

My social circle revolves around the music scene - which is a whole lotta guys. I love guys. They are cute as heck and taste just like chicken. \n\n From your previous posts about not ever trusting men and never wanting to lose control, etc., it surely sounded like you had a \"bad taste\" for the male population. \n \n\n There is no question that my negative experiences have fueled my desire to be independent.

So my life doesn't have a lot of romance and when it does, it's pretty easy on the head - that is by choice, not a sad product of my life. \n\n Fear of intimacy really isn't a choice, but I'll accept that you don't want any encumberances in your life after your son is grown. And not everyone living in \"the burbs\" lives a quiet life, trust me. My son and I spend a lot of our free time drag racing and working on cars and my neighbors know it. :) \n \n\n Personal freedom, independence and choice are absolutely critical to me.

So based on that, and the course I was planning for my future, I decided to get my tubes tied.\n\n Well, I admire independence and have two daughters that I've stressed it with. I don't want either of them to be dependent on another person, either. But there's a difference between dependence and inter-dependence. Inter-dependence can be a symbiotic relationship that is stronger than the sum of its parts. That's the kind of relationship that my wife and I have. We fully realized the strength of our relationship when she was diagnosed with cancer almost exactly a year ago and our relationship is stronger than ever. \n \n\n You have yet to address what I have brought up twice.

But, that was my mistaken interpretation. I don't have a problem with you not wanting any more kids and think that getting your tubes tied is a reasonable way to prevent an accidental pregnancy. I know lots of Conservative guys who wouldn't have a problem with you taking personal responsibility that way, either, so I was puzzled by your assertion to the contrary. \n In general, I think that you'll find that Conservative men treat women with more respect than the average man and certainly better than rock stars treat their groupies. :)",

It would take one hell of a felxible guy to snare me. And I certainly don't want to waste time mooning for it as if life weren't worth living without it.
