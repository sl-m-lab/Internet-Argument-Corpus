   "First some info. Doing an undergraduate course in geology here in University College Dublin. Entering 4th year now. My last year, 3rd year was hectic, generally 60 hour weeks, midterms and weekends taken up with fieldtrips. A stressful exam period, which I passed, only to be rewarded by a week long mapping training course in the west of Ireland, and then a 7 week mapping trip to Spain. Yes, seven summer weeks looking at rocks - joy - no summer for me. I am only back 2 weeks from this difficult, ball busting trip. So, all told a year of hard rockology with no real break.\n \n The issue is this, I have been considering deferring my 4th year to escape college for the year, and have the break I so desperately need - I am not sure I can do twenty straight months of rocks. My thesis (based on my work in Spain) will still have to be done, but I will effectively be deferring lectures, practicals and fieldtrips for a year. I would intend to get a job, hopefully in some thing relating to geology for the year, and also a bit of travelling, money is also an issue, as I have none of it now, and a year of earning could be very welcome. Means I will have spent a long time doing a 4 year degree\n \n Reasons to defer.\n Away from labs and other painful BS for a year\n Get money, have none currently.\n Travel at my leisure, with money earned\n Come back invigorated, ready to own those rocks next year\n Year of freedom\n \n Reasons against\n Forget load of stuff on return\n Could end up getting a pointless trivial job, if there are none available in my field - not much point in that\n Could easily end up just dosing\n Another year gone.\n \n Advice please, what should I do, similar experiences, travelling tips, job advice, anything!",

Abuse your youth to do something you would never do once you got a house, a wife and, above all, a mortgage.\n \n I live (but not study) in a city that houses a life science-oriented university, and I've met boatloads of people who study for (usually) 3 years and then take a break to do something fun (trekking in South East Asia, for example) or something completely out of whack that somehow vaguely relates to their studies (Go to Australia to build a mushroom farm?)\n \n So if you can, just do it, just for the personal satisfaction when you can take your grandchild on your knee to tell them you went to Australia to build a mushroom farm when you were young!\n \n Just to be clear, I would suggest either a job for 9-10 months with a long holiday in the end, or the out of whack job at a weird location",

   "Does it have to be a whole year break? When I was working on my undergrad I burned myself out one year by taking way too many credits at the same time. In fact I was getting my undergrad in Earth Science, minor in physics and chemistry. Science can be tough and I know what it's like to look at all those rocks. Anyway I took a 4 month break and that seemed to help a lot. I can't say I was the most effective person because honestly I was so exhausted. Before my short break I was taking 9 different courses. 4 of them were different lab classes that would require 3 hours of my time when they were in session and the other 5 courses were a combo of science and education courses. I would get about 2 to 3 hours of sleep every night and spent the rest of my time either in class, in the library doing research, or at home doing homework. I moved back home with my parents after that for the 4 months and opted to become their personal maid. I had no energy to even go out and get a job and deal with stress from a real boss. At least my parents paid me to be their maid and cook. After my 4 months of being a maid/cook I decided to go back to school. I felt so much better and I learned to not jam pack my schedule. So all in all a break would be beneficial, but you might not need to take a year off. However one thing you might want to do is go backpacking in Australia. You can get a working visa that will allow you to work at different jobs about 3 to 4 months at a time. It is an extremely popular thing to do, so you most likely would be able to find a job to do, unfortunately it probably wouldn't be in your field.",
