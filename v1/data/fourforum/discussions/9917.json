The Republican marker will be close, but not on, the Capitalist end, more than half way, about that 1/4th mark towards Capitalism; while the Democratic marker is very close to the Socialist end, almost right on it.

Clinton had a actual surplus of around 50 million. In a 2.1 trillion budget that's nothing. However, that budget doesn't account for off balance sheet financing, such as the postal service. Once you add those in, the surplus goes away. So on the B/S he actually did have a tiny surplus. off the B/s It didn't exist.\n \n And you're right, Clinton didn't even come close to eliminating the National debt.

   "At this point, noone could ever eliminate the debt, in my opinion. I believe a lack of cooperation caused the deficit problems in the 80s. The democratic congressmen would not reduce/eliminate funding for many programs that Reagan accounted for in his economic plan. Also Reagan would not sacrifice his tax cuts or his military spending. Therefore, we have no more Cold War, but a massive debt.\n \n The way I see it... there really isn't much difference in the goals. The farthest right want to completely eliminate government through giving people absolute freedom. The farthest left want to eventually eliminate government through restrictions of everything to the point of a routine. The two absolutes go so far apart that they go all the way around and meet in the middle. \n \n In short, the eventual goal is the same: to eventually destroy government completely in a utopian society. The differences are the way they go about it. These are just my thoughts, so what do you think?",
