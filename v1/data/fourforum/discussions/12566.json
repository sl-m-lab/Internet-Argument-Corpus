   "The only thing Wednesday's gatherings have in common with the 1773 Boston Tea Party is anger.\n \n But in Boston in 1773, the people were angry because they were being taxed and had no voice in the government levying those taxes. No one should be taxed by a government that denies them a voice.\n \n The British government took no heed of their anger, thus setting off what would become the fight for American independence. We won the right to peaceably gather and petition our government for redress of grievances.\n The original partygoers had a singular focus. They started an organized fight, and they won.\n \n In the modern-day tea parties that happened all over the country Wednesday night, however, the people who gathered were angry in general, not angry at anything specific. They were angry for all kinds of reasons: Taxes are too high. Congress is spending too much money. States are letting gay people get married. \"The media\" mistreated Sarah Palin. Abortion is immoral. We're leaving Iraq. Their candidate lost. These grassroots were really individual plants, each clinging to a different grain of anger.\n \n When real, focused grassroots efforts take hold, the people's voices are most important. But grass needs firm soil in which to grow.\n \n We all are anxious about the situation in which our nation finds itself. Some are worried about the direction it's headed. And some on the fringe seek to capitalize on the anxiety of others.\n \n The modern-day tea parties were drummed up by ultra-conservative commentators. Preying on average people's fears, they fan flames of anxiety and cast blame on President Obama and the Democratic Party. These were conservative Republican rallies in all but name.\n \n The rational voice of the average, concerned resident can be lost in the din of partisan bashing.\n \n We all want fair taxes.\n \n We all want elected officials to hear us.\n \n With all the challenges facing us, our best hope is in the spirit of democracy, in our ability to comprehend those challenges and openly debate the best ways to overcome them. There is no room for paralyzing fear - or calls to just say \"no\" to anything and everything.\n \n We must remain involved in the political process by speaking out - all of us. To do otherwise is to let those on either extreme steer our nation.\n \n We need discussion, not slogans, and deep-rooted ideas fairly debated. Then we'll be true to the roots put down by those real tea partiers long ago.\n \n Opinions expressed in this article represent the majority opinion of the newspaper's editorial board, consisting of: Roger Watson, president and publisher; David Fritz, executive editor; Cindy Corell, community conversations editor; and Jim McCloskey, editorial cartoonist.",

   "Personally, I think the points some have made about the original tea party being about lack of representation despite taxation are missing the point. The point is that there's a growing movement that doesn't like the overly-socialistic direction the US govt. is going--whether it's called a 'tea-party', 'block-party', or 'frat-party', it's the frustration at a government over-stepping its bounds that matters. With the GM mess and the govt. strong-arming people out, we're now seeing what happens in a nanny-state where govt. has too much control over corporations. It's why more and more banks and companies (and even some states) are refusing or giving back their so-called 'stimulus' money. Turns out the money was more about getting strings attached. I sure wouldn't take it if it were my decision. Selling your soul always seems like a good at first ...",

   "The Boston Tea Party, 1773, came out of a long-standing dispute with the East India Company over a corporate monopoly on the tea supplied to the colonies:\n \nAs Europeans developed a taste for tea in the 17th century, rival companies were formed to import the product from the East Indies. In England, Parliament gave the East India Company a monopoly on the importation of tea in 1698. When tea became popular in the British colonies, Parliament sought to eliminate foreign competition by passing an act in 1721 that required colonists to import their tea only from Great Britain. The East India Company did not export tea to the colonies; by law, the company was required to sell its tea wholesale at auctions in England. British firms bought this tea and exported it to the colonies, where they resold it to merchants in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Charleston.\n\n Boston Tea Party - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n They were also revolting against taxation without representation:\n \nColonists objected to the Tea Act for a variety of reasons, especially because they believed that it violated their constitutional right to be taxed only by their own elected representatives. Protestors had successfully prevented the unloading of taxed tea in three other colonies, but in Boston, embattled Royal Governor Thomas Hutchinson refused to allow the tea to be returned to Britain. He apparently did not expect that the protestors would choose to destroy the tea rather than concede the authority of a legislature in which they were not directly represented.\n\n \n We, in America, have taxation WITH representation if we get off our big fat duffs and go out and campaign and vote for the people we want to represent us. If we don't do that, we deserve to be taxed without representation.\n \n And, by the way, I did that and for a long time I was not represented but I still paid my taxes. Now it's my turn to have a little representation. We campaigned hard, we went and voted in droves, we won.\n \n Simple!",

The only ones who benefit are the ultra-rich. And their benefit makes them richer and richer. They don't engage the poor with their newly-found wealth in tax cuts. They just hire more people at minimum wage and engourge themselves with more riches. Oh lucky us!

You would think that all of the \"rich\" republicans are loosing their shirts to the poor and welfare receipents. They're like the rest of America and barely have two nickles to rub together. A 4% increase in their taxes, OMG what are we going to do now? THE SOCIALISTS ARE TAKING OVER!! We're headed toward fascism because a conservative isn't in the white house!

No one is going to benefit but the liberals, whatever the hell sense that makes to anyone.\n \n I do have a question for all my \"conservative brothers\".

Some cost may be passed on (probably not as anyone earning more than 250k can absorb it and no-one wants to raise prices in a recession) but nothing like the impact of the alternative - cutting public services that people rely on.\n\n \n Bassman is right. It's the liberals/Obama redistribution of wealth scheme (a concept centered in greed for other people's money, rather than earning it one's self) that doesn't work. To be more precise, it only works for a very short period of time until the rich move to another state (they're bailing out of big-tax areas NY and California left and right), or until they pass the increased taxes down to the little guy in the form of increased costs for goods and services; or until they move offshore - at which time the government loses whatever taxes they were previously able to get; or until the rich, now without as much money, quit investing in new businesses and products - the result being fewer new jobs for the little guy.\n \n I remember when the liberals went to place a 10% luxury tax on yacht sales (\"get the rich\"). What happened was the rich quit buying yachts so the yacht manufactures lost all kinds of money and the little guy who helped build the yachts got laid off. So it wasn't \"get the rich,\" it was the liberals screwing the little guy, again.\n \n Now the liberals are increasing the taxes on cigarettes. C-Store (convenience store) operators all of a sudden have to spend more capital to stock their stores, since the cost of smokes is now higher. Which means that the C-Store guys are going to incur additional interest costs from their banks to finance the inventory. Which means they make less money and have less to invest and/or they pass the increased costs down to Joe Blow who doesn't smoke, or to laborer Manuel who does, and once again the little guy takes it up the rear end. It's almost always the people the libs try to help that wind up taking it in the rear. Like the welfare state slugs who lost interest in making something of themselves, deciding instead to live off the state as much as they can.\n \n The problem with liberals is they have no vision. Another prime example: The do-gooders in San Francisco decided to give $400 checks to homeless people. Help the poor, right? Well, next thing you know every bum in America (criminals too) is showing up in San Fran for a free ride. Crime goes up, bums are everywhere hitting on regular folks for money, etc., and the police tell the libs they have to stop the madness, which they eventually did. A real cluster****.\n \n What else do we have to look forward to? The massive interest on paying for Obama's trillion dollar giveaways. Once again, the little guy is going to bend over for that one, in the decades ahead. Our children are screwed. That interest will come due and taxes on everyone will have to go up.\n \n And where does it end? It ends when you don't have the rich to screw with anymore because they've moved elsewhere. They're not stupid. They're not going to hang around for more liberal follies.\n \n Leave the rich alone unless they're doing something criminal, and they'll invest and create more jobs. Get rid of the freeloaders. Send the illegal aliens home or send them all to California and let them go broke even faster.\n \n It's no coincidence that the states with the most liberal governments are going broke the fastest, i.e. New York, California, Michigan, etc. And the liberal rags - the NY Times, the Boston Globe, etc., are the ones taking it in the shorts the fastest.\n \n One last thing - America is going down the drain. The libs are going to bankrupt our country and anyone with any common sense at all knows it.\n \n Even the liberals in Europe who have tried what Obama is trying, are warning us not to do it.",

If liberal states are so bad economically, why is it that Silicon Valley is in California rather than, say, Texas?\n \n As for cigarette taxes, do you not think that saving some lives by pricing people out of cigarettes (along with other public health measures) might be of benefit to people at the bottom end who are more likely to smoke and die early because of it? Even better, it might persuade the convenience store owner to stop stocking cigarettes, and therefore have fewer people smoking that way.\n \n You still seem to be under this bizarre impression that government services are some great leviathan out to crush you.

   "I think you're misunderstanding the goal of the fair tax...\n \n I doubt any Fair Tax supporters want bigger govt and more (or even the same) spending. But first and foremost we want to rationalize the way govt funds itself and take the power brokering out of the politicians' hands. The biggest plus to the fair tax though is the econ development it will spur since there will be a huge incentive for foreign and US companies to build here. Just look at Ireland...\nI understand the goal. It just doesn't accomplish this goal. It doesn't remove any power from the politicians as you can still change the tax code to accomplish what you want. In fact it is already done in the proposal by use of a prebate. There is also 0 indication that it would spur economic growth. If anything it would kill spending in the short run because people don't want to have a 30% tax on everything they buy. For loan purposes it is even more of a problem. Ireland, by the way, does have an income tax on corporations it just happens to be lower than other countries. Even so they have the VAT which makes up for it. The USA has a lower tax burden than Ireland anyway and the Fair Tax doesn't lower tax burden but merely shifts it around. On the plus side it might enhance exports which we read right now.\n \n The major point is this is a solution in search of a serious problem. As one poster here said, \"the titanic's sinking and you're thinking about whether to ask for a room with lilac lampshades.\"\n \n \nFair Tax = less power to politicians and lobbies\nNo way. You underestimate politicians.\n \n \nless collection costs\nreally a moot point when it comes to our spending.\n \n \nbusiness incentives to locate HERE\nDoubtful but the most likely out of the bunch.\n \n \npoor pay NO tax\nthey already don't.\n \n \ntax paid by people who normally don't have to pay \nmoot gains in comparison\n \n \nCurrent Tax system=......well, the way it is now!\nwhich is working good enough.",

   "Just look at Ireland...\n\n \n You mean one of the most severely damaged casualties of the credit crunch, now being forced to raise taxes and slash public spending because it's economy fell apart, precisely because of the under-regulated, low-tax economy you advocate, that was only successful in the first place because of huge amounts of EU development money from the UK and Germany?",
