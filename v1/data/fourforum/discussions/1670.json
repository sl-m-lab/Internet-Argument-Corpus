   "When I was in college, my experiences with liberal professors were similar to those that this author describes. I don't think my professors were as bad as this guy's, but maybe I just wasn't paying close enough attention. Anyway, the article is pretty good. I'd be interested to know if anyone else had similar experiences or if this sort of thing is unusual.\n The Title is: \"Lies My Teachers TOld Me\"\n \n This is a link to the article:\n \n http://www.politicallyright.com/article123.htm\n \n This is a quote:\n \n \"Just over a year ago, I received a degree in history from the largest state college in Massachusetts. Having enrolled as a history major with the hope of acquiring a well-rounded historical perspective, I assumed that my professors would encourage my disinterested ambition. I was wrong. \n \n With just a few exceptions, my professors were leftists who infused their lectures with political opinion and assigned reading material that reinforced their leftwing views. For information that would help me develop a balanced perspective on history, particularly the history of the West, I was forced to look beyond the confines of my formal education.\"",

(really in just one or two issues so far) It unsettled me to realize that I hadn't known what was happening. I've saved the article, although I think Politically Right is much too contentious and arrogant at times, it should come in handy to balance my viewpoints.",

While there were many historical inacuracies cited in the book, as it wore on it became increasingly clear that the author was persuing his own agenda (namely the glorification of african influence on the founding and development of America). While this is not a bad thing, and he certainly brought to light some historical inacuracies in regards to African and African-American influences, I felt that some of his observations and ideas were optomistic at best.",

If you are taking university courses it is often good to find out which way the institution is leaning. It is impossible to seperate objective teaching and value transfers from your own oppinion (if you are a teacher), there will always be some bias.",

A conservative goes to college for 7 yrs and gets an MBA and tops out at 22 million a year.\n \n Unfortunatly, this leaves a bunch of liberals to try their best to brainwash the next generation.

Instead of teaching only evolution/Big Bang/whatever as the school sets down, and the book constantly talks about as the only factual theory, he presented the other side as well and concluded by saying \"I went to theology school for two years. I am a scientist. I do research. I can debate both ways equally.\" My respect for him skyrocketed.",
