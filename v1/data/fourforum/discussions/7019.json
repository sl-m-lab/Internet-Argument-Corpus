   "The Star of Bethlehem emoticon_xangel - appearing on March 2nd 5 BC\n \n Background information and links to actual ancient star charts:\n \n Any celestial event that is assigned a 'meaning' (beyond physics) is within the realm of ancient astrology. \n \n Astronomy is 'observation' and astrology is 'interpretation'. So the appearance of a 'star' indicating a 'birth' is, in fact, an astrological context (interpreting astronomical events).\n \n At the time of the birth of Christ, astrology and astronomy were the same 'science'. In fact, the only reason that celestial events and objects were studied was to try to ascertain what 'meaning' was to be derived from the observed phenomena. \n \n To date, all of the astronomical theories and possibilities for possible Star of Bethlehem candidates have been thoroughly investigated. All of the astronomical theories are rather mundane, however, all astronomical commentators have done a superb investigatory job probing the window of time (7 BC to 4 BC) and coming up with possible 'Star of Bethlehem' theories.\n \n Christ, according to the New Testament, was born before King Herod died. Herod's death is a matter of historical account and it occurred in April of 4 BC ( 3 B.C.E. because of no year \"0\" ). A lunar eclipse marked the passing of Herod (April 13th 4 BC).\n \n NO ONE but the Magi 'saw' the star. \n \n The star that 'stops' (over a house) is the sun at a solstice point (solstice means 'sun stationary') and a 'house' is a component of an ancient (and contemporary) astrological chart. \n \n The 'house' of (containing) the mother is the astrological 4th house which begins at the time of the summer solstice.\n \n The Old Testament states that the Messiah/King will be born in Bethlehem (Hebrew for 'house of bread'). 'Bread', in astrology, is related to the astrological sign of Virgo (The Virgin). \n \n There is further writing in the Old Testament about a 'star' (asterism, which is also plural and meaning a 'collection of' or 'constellation') linked to the birth of the Messiah/King. \n \n It was from these prophesies that the Persian Magi became aware of the birth of a Messiah / King. The only remaining issue is 'what star'? \n \n The Persian Magi were highly advanced astronomer/astrologers. By 'highly advanced' I mean being possessed of the knowledge of the entire solar system as it is encoded in mathematic symbols in the construction of The Great Pyramid at Giza (2800 BC). \n See, http://www.templeofsolomon.org/Pyramids/pyramid_symbolism.htm for a virtual mind boggling overview of The Great Pyramid. \n \n With that said, it seems that the Star of Bethlehem was an astrological event witnessed ONLY by the highly advance Persian Magi. \n \n The 'Star' is revealed in an ancient astrological chart and created by the astrological (geometric) associations (planetary aspects) of moving bodies in our solar system. \n \n The star chart can be viewed here:\n http://www.templeofsolomon.org/pageone.htg/pageone.htm\n \n A comparison of astronomical charts and astrological charts for the \n 2nd of March 5 BC can be seen here:\n http://www.templeofsolomon.org/StarofBethlehem-star.htm\n \n The astrological charts have been prepared by employing the same methods that were used by ancient astrologers at the time of the birth of Christ. The configuration revealed in the star charts occurs only once in over 40,000,000 years!\n \n The Season's Best to One and All,\n John Charles Webb, Jr.",

   "A Star out of Jacob\n \n THE HEBREW SCRIPTURES\n \n Also your descendants shall be as the dust of the earth; you shall spread abroad to the west and the east, to the north and the south; and in you and in your seed all the families of the earth shall be blessed. (Genesis 28:14)\n \n I see Him, but not now; I behold Him, but not near; a Star shall come out of Jacob; a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and batter the brow of Moab, and destroy all the sons of tumult. (Numbers 24:17)\n \n THE RABBINIC WRITINGS\n \n A STAR shall proceed out of Jacob, and there shall come a SCEPTRE in Israel. The KING Messiah is here spoken of as a STAR. (Rabbi Lieva of Prague)\n \n When a king shall arise out of Jacob and the Messiah be anointed from Israel, He will slay the princes of Moab, and reign over all the children of man. (Targum Onkelos)\n \n Our rabbis have a tradition that in the week in which the Messiah will be born there will be a bright STAR in the east , which is \"THE STAR OF THE Messiah.\" (Pesikta Sortarta fol. 58. c.1)\n \n THE NEW TESTAMENT\n \n Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem, saying, \"Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the East and have come to worship Him.\" When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born. So they said to him, \"In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the prophet: 'But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, Are not the least among the rulers of Judah; For out of you shall come a Ruler Who will shepherd My people Israel.' \" Then Herod, when he had secretly called the wise men, determined from them what time the star appeared. And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, \"Go and search carefully for the young Child, and when you have found [Him,] bring back word to me, that I may come and worship Him also.\" When they heard the king, they departed; and behold, the star which they had seen in the East went before them, till it came and stood over where the young Child was.
