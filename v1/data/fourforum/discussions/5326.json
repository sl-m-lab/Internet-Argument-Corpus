Once you run it you will have to reboot for it run. It requires control of the OS to run a thorough disk check.\n \n Have you checked your BIOS setting on you power settings?",

Walk me through the steps here exactly what I am to do. I want to run something that will tell me for sure whether or not there is a physical problem with the disk.

Much too long and for lenghty periods the HD light doesn't come on and then it mysteriously completes the process and the windows screen comes up with the icons. Then it works normally.

Just kidding.\n \n Ok, double click 'my comp' on your OS HD right click and choose the 'tools' tab. There should be a scan disk. Chose it, and check all tests. Click 'ok' and it will ask you if you want to reboot.\n \n If it is not your disk after that, you can try 4 things.\n 1. Reset you BIOS to defaults.\n 2. Reflash your BIOS\n 3. Check your drivers\n 4. typing fdisk /mbr to fix the master boot record. Unfortunately you will need a Windows 95/98/Me boot floppy for that. If you ask nice I might be able to e-mail you a boot file! Heh...ya got to beg though!",

I can't explain it but it appears that there was about 16 copies of the operating system installed. That was what was slowing down the start-up. Now it is humming like a fine tuned engine. Still have to install the latest video driver but it is fine now. Thanks to everyone for their advice.",
