Maybe this is for another thread, but liberals  did not lose seats in a lot of traditionally liberal  strongholds, democrats  lost seats in a lot of traditionally democratic  strongholds. They aren't neccessarily the same thing, just as a conservative and a republican aren't necessarily the same thing. I get very frustated with this confusion of terms because many (most really) democrats on the national stage aren't truly liberal (the same goes on the coservative/ republican side, which frustrates me as well). This is definately a huge problem I have with many politicians, and this may be part of the problem you are having with democrats. You may either be falsely applying the label \"liberal\" to a democrat who isn't and then disliking them for it, or you may assume a democrat is liberal when they aren't and call their positions liberal and hate \"liberals\" for it.\n \n But anyways, the reason the democrats (the ones with any guts anyways) opposed her confirmation, is simply that they believe (and IMO rightly) that she is not the person for the job.

   "So if we wait a bit longer, let us say 50 years the Nazis will be forgiven just like the Brits. OK with me. emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n \n But you don't see the difference ? What the British did 150 - 200 years ago was the norm for those centuries, ....but what the germans did in the 1940's was not the norm for the 1940's.\n \n So when germany is judged by the 1940's standards, its behaviour will be found to be cruel and barbaric by 1940's standards.....and will always remain so even 300 or 1000 years later.\n \n When people judge the Roman empire (they had slaves) do people judge them by that era or by today's standards ? They judge them by the era in which the Roman empire existed , when slavery was acceptable.\n \n Likewise when people judge the British empire , it's mistakes will be judged by the era when it happened. If they occurred in the 18th or 19th century , they will be judged by 18th or 19th century standards.\n \n So when we come to germany... germany's behaviour in WW2 will be judged by 1940's standards .....and will be found to be so cruel and barbaric by that era ....so you are indulging in wishful thinking if you think if you just wait 50 years more , it will be all forgotten .",

I was talking about British colonies in the 1940's. \n \n The concentration camps in the boer war.....did they have gas ovens ? were people chemically gassed in showers ? were medical experiments performed on healthy people ? . They had nothing on the cruelty and barbarism in german concentration camps in the 1940's. Again you are going back more than 150 years to compare what germany did in the 1940's.\n \n Don't make absurd comparisons about what countries did more than 150 -200 years ago to what Germany did in the 1940's. If you want to make comparisons , compare what other countries did in the 1940's.\n\n Stalin was massacring people by the millions in the Soviet Union; the Chinese were involved in civil war where millions lost their lives also. The Americans were 'testing' their first nuclear bombs on the Japanese cities......the list goes on and on...",

Make that these scoundrel people change their mind i think is going to be as it were one crashed 200 km per hour heading on a concrete wall, not even jesuscrist preaching love could get the people would change their mind so much more less i think this well intentioned man is going to be able to cope against the nastyness of these shameless and mad individuals, what do you think Mae?, greets for you hun. emoticon_frazzled (so i'm afraid Mr. Blair is going to have a really hard work to come).",
