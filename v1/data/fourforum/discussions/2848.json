   "This is a letter from a personal friend of mine who knows of what he speaks.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n RLM \n \n \n \n As follows:\n \n \n \n As my second trip to Iraq is nearing completion I felt compelled to write another letter to the editor. My work is directly related to the control system redesign and modernization of the country's electrical power generation and distribution control system. It along with other major projects are steadily proceeding towards completion. However, there's still much to be done. \n \n \n \n This country's entire civil infrastructure has been in serious decline for years. Devastation by two wars and monumental neglect through a lack of funds has crippled the complete civil infrastructure. My hat goes off to the ability of the Iraqi engineers who were able to keep public services even moderately operational. Nothing holds true more than in the electrical generation and distribution sector. The fact that this antiquated equipment was kept online and producing electricity is amazing. I've learned such is the resilience of the Iraqi people. \n \n \n \n The Iraqi government has finally started to assume the reins of control since the transition of power on the twenty eighth of June. As I mentioned in my previous letter to the editor the internal turmoil is now an Iraqi on Iraqi issue. The outside influence of other nations, such as Iran and Syria is all too obvious and even though they are in a denial the facts speak for themselves. \n \n \n \n I see much on American television that greatly dismays me. Not to be misunderstood, as Iraq is still a very dangerous place. However there are many positive things happening here that aren't reported. I guess bad news sells best. \n \n \n \n It appears the tide is finally starting to turn in the interim government's favor. The violence of the past few weeks has strengthened the government's resolve to stop civil disobedience and assert control as the true and sovereign authority in Iraq. Democracy is starting to evolve. People are finally realizing they're free. Free to speak their minds without reprisal of imprisonment, torture and eventually a slow and painful death at the hands of a sadistic tyrant's thugs. \n \n \n \n Two days after the impromptu transition of power ceremony an Iraqi electrical engineer in my office asked permission to bring a couple of bottles of wine to work for a toast to Iraqi independence on the official independence day. Upon the completion of our toast Raphe and several other Iraqis started to cry.\n \n \n \n I realized here's a group of people all over forty years of age who are experiencing freedom for the first time in their lives. At that moment I realized what it means to be an American. I finally realized after forty-nine years of life how truly lucky I am to be an American. As an American working in Iraq I assure you we are still doing the right thing by being here. What price can you place on freedom? I can never define that sum, as of now it's priceless to me. \n \n \n \n In closing I just wanted to say \"I only wish I could have shared that one moment with everyone at home.\" It reached beyond profound and defines everything good and worthwhile we as a country and a people represent. I will never forget that brief moment when we as Americans thousands of miles from home realized we'd had a small part in making a big difference in the lives of millions and by doing so had made an unforgettable difference in our own. \n \n \n \n Ronnie McCoy\n \n Long Beach, MS\n \n Baghdad, Iraq",
