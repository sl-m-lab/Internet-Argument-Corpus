He's always going 'BAM'. So I guess he knows how to catch them in the wild. Surely he has something for me to 'kick it up a notch.' \n I've watch Sweeney Todd several times in many forms yet, can never find a recipe in it for their tasty treats and meat pies.\n \n Maybe the new Tim Burton version next year starring Johnny Depp and Alan Rickman will actually take the time to introduce a recipe.\n Or, does anyone know if Dahmer had a book out?\n \n \n emoticon_xhoho",
