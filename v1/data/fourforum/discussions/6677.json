   "October 21, 2005\n Editorial\n Guatemala's Murdered Women \n For the last five years, Guatemala has suffered an epidemic of gruesome killings of women that are as mysterious as they are brutal. Typically a young woman in Guatemala City vanishes, and her body turns up a few days later in a garbage bag or in an open field. Many of the women's faces and bodies have been mutilated, and many have been tortured sexually or otherwise. Some of the bodies have messages, like \"death to bitches,\" scrawled on them.\n \n In Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, a pattern of hundreds of killings of this type has drawn international condemnation. But aside from reports by Amnesty International and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the Guatemalan women's deaths have gotten very little attention. At least a thousand women have been victims in the past five years, and only three killers are in prison. The police do not even investigate a vast majority of cases.\n \n Guatemala does not keep reliable statistics. But it is clear that a pattern of these killings was first seen in 2000, and the reported numbers have risen since then. Last year, there were 590 such killings of women, and the murders have grown more grisly. Many of the women were victims of gang warfare. Others were killed by husbands or boyfriends. But there are also cases of college students or shop workers who had no links to crime and simply disappeared - until their bodies were found.\n \n What the women have in common is that their cases go nowhere. Overwhelmingly, victims' families report that the response of the authorities is a lack of interest. The police assure them that a missing daughter, for example, has run off with a boyfriend. When the body turns up, the crime is often dismissed with comments that the dead woman must have been a gang member or a prostitute, or killed by her partner - as if these were justifications for failing to investigate.\n \n Guatemala has recently signed several international conventions protecting women, and it has established such new organizations as the office of the special prosecutor for crimes against women. But this progress is largely on paper. Laws are not enforced, and there is no money to finance the new offices. Guatemala is still a country where a rapist can escape charges by marrying the victim, and domestic violence cases can be prosecuted only if the victim can still show bruises 10 days later. Sexual harassment is not illegal.\n \n When such outdated attitudes toward women prevail, it is easy for the local authorities to justify taking no action when young women are murdered. Their inaction gives an official green light to the killers of women.",

   "Interesting question, trebor. Did religion create the culture?\n \n Or did culture create the religion?\n \n I might toss in the dichotomy of Norse paganism as opposed to Mediterranean mythology and Roman Catholicism.\n \n In Norse paganism women are esteemed as much as men are. You can see how this paganism has continued to influence the role of women in Scandinavian countries--women hold more positions of power in Scandinavian countries than any where else in the world.\n \n Also, until quite recently, the incidence of rape was low, compared to the rest of the world. That has changed because of the influx of persons of other cultures to Scandinavian nations.\n \n There is a great difference, also, between the Norse god Odin and the Roman or Greek god Zeus or Jupiter. Zeus and Jupiter, their basic character is that they are rapists and womanizers. Hera and Juno continually are at their wits end because of the unfaithfulness of Zeus and Jupiter. Also, Hera and Juno are absolutely chaste and faithful to the putos Zeus and Jupiter.\n \n In Norse mythology, gods and goddesses are not necessarily faithful to each other because, essentially, the concept of cuckoldry does not exist. Cuckoldry is essentially a Mediterranean and Middle Eastern concept, at least within the European context.\n \n Also, Odin is obliged, because of whatever has been foretold, to father a number of children by females other than his wife. There is never a case of rape. In all cases Odin must woo and persuade these other females to be the mothers of the various children needed to carry out certain prophecies.\n \n Sometimes, it takes him a very long time to persuade but force is absolutely never, ever used. And, it can be assumed that Frigga, Odin's wife, is fooling around if she feels like it.\n \n Now, the Zeusian ideal has been carried into Mediterranean and Middle Eastern culture. Men are exalted for the number of women they have raped or seduced, for the number of children they have fathered by whatever means.\n \n One almost senses, however, that in the case of Odin, there is a certain amount of reluctance, of hesitation, but resolution to fulfill the various prophecies.",

Spaniards, using firepower against primitive weaponry to plunder gold and silver resources, in conjunction with Catholicism restructured the original, considered primitive worship systems into an effective means of governing large masses of natives by fear. While some remnants of original worship culture remains in isolated instances, wealth (which always controls the military) using carrot and stick Catholicism has taken the place of sacrificing virgins and other rituals as the governing control method.

The local 'Catholic' church had been stripped of most of its christian iconography. The entire nave was occupied by indigenous shamans, each sitting tailor-fashion before a blanket, each with his stock of feathers and incense; local peasants were queuing up to pay the shamans to intercede on their behalf with whatever deity might effect the resolution of their immediate needs. When asked, the peasants fervently declared themselves Catholic christians.\n \n As an object lesson in applied religion, this had no equal.\n \n We visited Haiti in the same year. Again, we were struck by the unique blend of Catholicism with paganism - precisely meeting the local populace's requirements.\n \n These experiences were instrumental in forming my view that religion adapts itself to sociopolitical circumstances, not vice versa.",
