   "i recorded this song in Nashville yesterday....Jim\n \n \n I LOOKED TWICE!\n Jim Colyer\n \n I walked in, and there he was on the stage \n The right looks, right size, the right age \n But I'm so burned out on good-looking guys \n I won't even let 'em catch my eye \n I went to the bar, I got me a beer \n The band started playing, I didn't care \n But I changed my mind \n When he started singing his song \n \n It wasn't love at first sight \n But, thank God, I Looked Twice! \n I looked below the surface \n And I liked what I saw \n I've had my share of tight fitting jeans \n I've had my share of late night scenes \n It wasn't love at first sight \n But I Looked Twice! \n \n The band took a break, he walked up to me \n He had charm, he had oompf, he got me \n He knew just what to say and how to say it \n He said I'm his favorite song and he's gonna play it \n I found out what we've got in common \n A deep-seated need to share good loving \n Now I'm his lady \n And he's my Mister Right \n \n It wasn't love at first sight \n But, thank God, I Looked Twice! \n I looked below the surface \n And I liked what I saw \n I've had my share of tight fitting jeans \n I've had my share of late night scenes \n It wasn't love at first sight \n But I Looked Twice! \n \n solo \n \n I've had my share of tight fitting jeans \n I've had my share of late night scenes \n It wasn't love at first sight \n But I Looked Twice! \n It wasn't love at first sight \n But I Looked Twice! \n \n Jim Colyer ascap",
