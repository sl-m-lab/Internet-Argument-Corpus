   "Ive followed these debates with interest and ive often thrown in my two pennies worth.\n \n Ive often asked creationists in these debates to explain to me the dinosaurs, so far ive had no real response, other than the usual religious mumbo jumbo.\n \n The closest answer ive got(in fact the only answer) was that god describes all reptiles in one word and that dinosaurs are reptiles and so that explains it.\n \n so creationists, ive got a little poser for you, evidence proves dinosaurs existed millions of years ago, way before the bible was written, in fact before the creation. So can you explain this little detail in your creation theory?\n \n Come on creationists, prove your theory. Im not holding my breath though.",

   "I've tried debating this same topic several times and I get the same types of responses over and over. Here are the two best ones and no, the theory that dinosaurs bones were placed in the earth when God made it is not a good theory.\n \n Old Earth theory: The earth is not some 6,000 - 10,000 years old like the Young Earth theory would proclaim. The six days mentioned in the Bible is actually more like 6 billion years and dinosaurs existed and became extinct somewhere in that time period. I seen a scientific poll once that showed that about 25% of all christians believed in the Old Earth theory. So the fact is that christianity does not live and die by proving how old the earth is even if those types of believers are a vast miniority.\n \n Man and Dinos walked together: This is possibly the most convincing one I've heard. Obviously a Young Earth theory. Carbon dating is flawed and may be inaccurate in dating dino bones. Some cave paintings made by primative humans accurately depict certain dinosaurs. Dinosaurs were in the bible under the names of tanniyn (dragon), behemoth (brachiosaurus), and Leviathan (kronosaurus)\n \n Behemoth has the following attributes according to Job 40:15-24\n \n It \"eats grass like an ox.\" \n It \"moves his tail like a cedar.\" (In Hebrew, this literally reads, \"he lets hang his tail like a cedar.\") \n Its \"bones are like beams of bronze,\n His ribs like bars of iron.\" \n \"He is the first of the ways of God.\" \n \"He lies under the lotus trees,\n In a covert of reeds and marsh.\" \n \n (http://www.clarifyingchristianity.com/dinos.shtml)\n \n In addition to this theory dinos were part of the evil that was destroyed in the flood or possibly before this time. First off they could never have been put on the arc. Secondly this would explain why no one remembers ever seeing one except Noah and he obviously didn't say much about them. Thirdly this would explain why they are buried so deep in the dirt of the earth as a great flood put them under many feet of dirt and sediment once the flood cleared up.",

   "OH GOODY! I love dinosaurs. (Anyone wanna know all that is wrong with Jurrasic Park?)\n\n Don't we all. Thanks but no thanks on the offer about Jurrasic Park. I'm pretty much aware of what is wrong.\n \nTrue, carbon dating is not accurate in dating dinosaur bones (or other fossils from the same period). That's why it is not used.\n\n Absolutely correct. Dinosaur bones are essentially rock with only a very rare exception. Carbon dating isn't useful for rock or for anything older than about 50,000 years.\n \nCarbon's half life is too short. Bottom line - it does not go back far enough.\n\n Yes. That's it.\n \nNot to mention it isn't used on the bones at all.\n\n If the bones are less than about 50,000 years and if some of the original organic structure is still present, it can be used.\n \nRadioisotope dating is done on the rocks that fossils are found in.\n\n Actually, the dating is done on layers above and below the rock in which fossils are found. You see, generally fossils are found in some sort of sedimentary rock. And sedimentary rock cannot be dated. But a layer of volcanic ash above and below the fossil can be dated and thus give a date within a range.\n \nCertain elements decay at a known standard rate, measurung the amount of the decay can tell them how long that element/rock (and whatever is in it has been there).\n\n And it is heat that resets the clock. Thus it is volcanic rock and ash that can be dated most reliably. \n \nI don't believe that man and dinosaur walked the earth together. (Although dragon legends are believed to be in part inspired by the discovery of dinosaur bones.)\n\n And I've been to Paluxy and I still don't blieve that there are human tracks among the dinosaur tracks.\n \nI have actually worked with fossils that are tens of millions of years old. They aren't bones, they are rock.\n\n Exactly. And they aren't the kind of rock that can be dated. The is why the layers above and below are dated.\n \nI don't believe many human remains are found like that.\n\n Correction. I don't believe that any human remains are found like that.\n \nBones are converted to rock by water slowly replacing the living tissue with minerals. It takes a long, long, long time. Not to mention carbon dating does work for most human remains (effective for 70,000 years or younger), but not dinosaurs.\n\n Well, I'm told that the upper limits have been extended by more accurate instruments, but I'm an old bugger who learned 50,000 years for carbon dating. I'm going to stick with that until I've seen some real data.\n \nOne of the things interesting things brought up about the idea that the dinosaurs died in the flood. The same event that killed the dinosaurs also killed a lot of marine life. Why would marine life die in a flood?????\n\n But then, according to creationists, those dead clams were washed up to the top of the mountains. We find bivalves on Everest. And still, they propose \"hydrologic sorting\" to explain the fossil recored. How did those shellfish get to the top of the higest mountains? Were they once under water? Exactly! The answer is in plate tectonics.",

Please tell me (us) you're kidding.\n\n Actually, I'm not.\n \n The word \"koach\" -strength- can be used to refer to reproductive strength.\n \n And of course, the word \"mothen\" -loins- is a direct reference to the pubic region and the reproductive organs.\n \n The word \"'own\" -force- means reproductive force in other Biblical contexts.

   "Sorry, I was delayed.\n \n First let's give a more complete list of the text:\n \n 15 Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox. 16 Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly. 17 He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together. 18 His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron. 19 He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him. 20 Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play. 21 He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens. 22 The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about. 23 Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth. 24 He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.\n \n Next let's provide an accurate definition of some of the words in The Book of Job. All of the following can be referenced in:\n \n \"Strong's Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible\"\n \n 1st word will be the English translation,\n 2nd word will be the English transliteration of the Hebrew word,\n 3rd will be 'Strong's' reference number for the Hebrew word,\n 4th will be the definition.\n \n \n Loins - mothen - 4975 - from an unused root mean. to be slender; prop. the waist or small of the back; only in plur. the loins: - + greyhound, loins, side.\n \n Sinews - giyd - 1517 - a thong (as compressing); by anal. A tendon: - sinew.\n \n Tail - zanab - 2180 - (in the orig. sense of flapping); the tail (lit. or fig.): - tail.\n \n Strength - koach - 3581 - from an unused root mean. to be firm; vigor, lit. (force in a good or a bad sense) or fig. (capacity, means, produce); also (from its hardiness) a large lizard: - ability, able, chameleon, force, fruits, might, power(-ful), strength, substance, wealth.\n \n \n All the above are exactly as the definitions appear in the book.\n \n I'll go over a few more words here. If you insist, I will type them word for word, and punctuation for punctuation as I did with the ones above. Just let me know and I will.\n \n Navel - shariyr - 8306 - is only defined as \"cord\" or \"sinew\". However, the word is derived from the Hebrew word:\n Shor - 8270 - which gives the meaning \"a string (as twisted)\" or an \"umbilical cord\", BUT also gives the figurative meaning of \"the center of strength\".\n \n You completely misrepresent with the word FORCE. The Hebrew word OWN is translated as: ability, power, and figuratively as goods, might, strength, substance. To say this is reproductive strength is so misleading it's hard for me to think it's an accident. Here, fill in the blank: his ________ strength. Could be economic, upper, lower, inner, emotional, physical. What a ridiculous and misleading statement.\n \n Now let's look at your catch all:\n \n \n Also, the book of Job is just a story. It isn't history. It is a moral tale and does not represent events that actually took place. \n\n \n This would be known as a dogmatic opinion because you begin with your presupposition that there is no God and no Satan. Because existence or nonexistence of a being outside of our space/time dimension can not be proven or disproved, this remains your 'opinion'.\n \n But guess what, IT DOESN'T MATTER! It just doesn't matter. Your effort to use this \"catch all\" demonstrates to me that you have little faith (rightly so) in your original (inaccurate) explanation. Even if the Book of Job is completely fiction, to say that they just 'made up some creatures that didn't exist' is completely ridiculous! The previous chapter talks about the wild goat, wild ***, horse, peacock, ostrich, hawk and eagle. After naming all of these, you're going to claim the writer just makes up some nonexistent creature!?!?! This was supposed to be your \"catch all\", but when you break it down, it's even more lackluster than your original claim which turns out to be opinion mixed with a misinterpretation of the language. (accident? - we'll give you the benefit of the doubt)\n \n \n Now to your original 'claim'; if his schlong is swinging around like a cedar - damn!!! Must be a Supersaurus, or an Ultrasaurus, who knows. You're talking about the Bible? The book that mentions men with schlongs like donkeys, that emit semen like horses, and men that 'pull out' of women when they orgasm so they won't impregnate them? You think they're embarrassed to say penis? This would be another of your opinions, and a weak one at that. Your twisted opinions and inaccurate interpretations of the language don't even make your case though.....\n \n Follow on with the rest of the story:\n \n His bones are like pieces of brass and bars of iron;\n He drinks up a river without hesitation;\n And he's confident he can drink the whole thing!\n \n Look, all the talk about his nads (stones), his tendons and his loins (which we now know from an accurate interpretation is talking about his middle area, i.e., waist), is all referencing the strength of the abdomen and midsection area of this creature which is needed to swing that big freakin' tail around. I take it you've seen an \"artist's rendition\" of what a 'dinosaur' might look like according to the fossils that have been found. This turns out to be a very accurate description of the midsection area of one of these creatures.\n \n Two more things: the Hebrew word zanab, which we translate as tail, is used a total of 10 times (including this one) in the Bible. Guess what it's OBVIOUSLY talking about every single time - A FREAKIN' TAIL!!!!\n \n And lastly - there are many Hebrew words that can translate to the English word Strength. But did you notice something about the one used here: koach? Look again and see where the definition correlates the word to a \"LARGE LIZARD\"!!!! And unlike you, I didn't just fly off the top of my head with these interpretations. These are the TRUE interpretations!",

   "To Plotter:\n Actually there is good evidence that dinosaurs were created in the creation week about six thousand years ago. This post will be about dinosaurs and the evidence that they lived with man. According to the Bible dinosaurs first existed around 6,000 years ago. God made the dinosaurs, along with the other land animals, on Day Six of the Creation Week. Adam and Eve were also made on Day Six. Dinosaurs could not have died out before people appeared, because according to the Bible dinosaurs had not previously existed, and death, suffering and bloodshed came about because of Adam's sin.Representatives of all the kinds of air-breathing land animals, including the dinosaur kinds, went on board Noah's Ark. All those left outside the Ark died in the global flood - many becoming fossils. After the flood (4,500 years ago) the remnant of the land animals, including dinosaurs, came off the Ark and lived in the present world with people. The Post-Flood climatic change, lack of food, disease,and man's activities cause many types of animals to become extinct. The dinosaurs, like many other creatures died out by these causes.\n \n Interestingly enough, the dinosaurs were mentioned in the Bible. Of course, the word dinosaur was mentioned, because it had not been invented then when the Bible came into being, it was invented in 1841, hence, one would not expect to find the word \"dinosaurs\" in the Bible. What about another word though? Perhaps the term \"dragon\" may have been a word used to describe these dinosaurs? Well, there are many dragon legends from all around the world. Many \"dragon\" descriptions fit the characteristics of specific dinosaurs. The Hebrew words commonly translated \"dragon\" in the KJV (King James Version), tan, tannin, tannim, tannoth, appears in the Old Testament some 30 times. There are passages in the Bible about \"dragons\" that lived on the land (Jer. 51:34) and (Mal. 1:3). Many Biblical creationists believe that in many contexts these could refer to what we now call dinosaurs. Job 41 describes a great animal that lived in the sea, Leviathan, that even breathed fire. THis \"dragon\" may have been something like the mighty 17 metre long Kronosaurus, or the 25 metre long Liopleurodon. There is also mention of a flying serpent in the Bible (Isa. 30:6). This could be a reference to one of the pterodactyls, such as the Pteranodon, Rhamphorhynchus, etc.\n \n Not long after the flood, God was showing a great man called Job great He was as Creator, in Job 40:15-19 Job is told this: \"Behold now behemoth, which I made with you; he eats grass like an ox. See now, his strength in his loins, and his force is in the muscles of his belly. He moves his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his thighs are knit together. His bones are like tubes of bronze; his limbs are like bars of iron. He is the chief of the ways of God: his maker brings near his sword.\"\n \"Chief of the ways of God\" suggests this was the largest land animal God had made. Some people say that behemoth was a hippo or an elephant. But the hippo and the elephant are not the largest land creatures made, and their tales are not as big as cedar trees. When, in games like Rogue Squadron, they often describe the AT-AT's as behemoth -- which translates to one big, massive object and get out of its way!\n \n There are many other ancient records of dinosaurs:\n * A Sumerian story dating back to 2,000 BC or mroe tells of a hero named Gilgamesh, who encountered a huge vicious dragon which he slew, cutting off its head as a trophy.\n * When Alexander the Great (c. 330 BC) and his soldiers marched into India, they found that the Indians worshipped huge hissing reptiles that they kept in caves.\n * China is renowned for its dragon stories.\n * England has its story of St George, who slew a dragon that lived in a cave.\n * There is a story of a 10th century Irishman who wrote of an encounter with what appears to have been a Stegosaurus. \n * In the 1500's a European scientific book, Historia Animalium, listed several animals that we would call dinosaurs as still alive. A well known naturalist of the time, Ulysses Aldrovandus, recordered an encounter between a peasant name Baptista and a dragon whose description fits that of the samll dinosaur Tanystropheus. The encounter was on May 13, 1572, near Bologna in Italy - the peasant killed the dragon.\n * Petroglyphs (drawings carved on rock) of dinosaur-like creatures have also been found, such as the Ancient Indian rock drawing of a sauropod dinosaur from White River Canyon, Utah - these show that dinosaurs co-existed with man.\n * Scientists from the Univsertiy of Montana found T. rex bones that were not totally fossilzed. Sections of the bones were like fresth bone and contained what seems to be blood cells and hemoglobin. If these bones really were millions of years old, then the blood cells and hemoglobin would have totally disintegrated. A report by the scientists stated the following:\n \"A think slice of T.rex bone glowed amber beneath the lens of my microscope ... the lab filled with murmurs and amazement, for I had focused on something inside the vessels that none of us had ever noticed before: tiny round objects, transulcent red with a dark center ... Red blood cells? The shape and location suggested them, but blood cells are mostly wawter and couldn't possibly have stayed perserved in the 65 milion year old tyrannosaur ... The bone sample that had us so excited came from a beautiful, nearly complete specimen of Tyrannosaurus rx uneathered in 1990 ... When the team brought the dinosaur into the lab, we noticed that some parts deep inside the long bone of the leg had not completely fossilized ... So far, we think that all of this evidence supports the notion that our slices of T. rex could contain perserved heme and hemoglobin fragments. But more work needs to be done before we are confident enough to come right out and say, \"Yes, this T. rex has blood compounds left in its tissues.\"\" Schweitzer, M. and Staedter, T., 1997. The real Jurassic Park. Earth, June 1997, pp. 55-57.\n \n * Many indigenous cultures all around the world have also reported or have stories of dinosaur like creatures all around the world; including the Australian Aboriginals.\n \n You may be wondering how these dinosaurs could have got onto the Ark. Well, firstly the Ark ain't no small ship! It isn't like the ones that you may have seen with the Giraffe's head poking out the top of it! This ship was HUGE! Possibly bigger than or equal to the Titanic. Secondly, the average size of a dinosaur is about the size of a sheep. And btw, the animals would have most likely been \"teenagers\" or less and hence, they wouldn't have been that tall.\n \n For a more detalied look into the creationist argument about dinosaurs, I would encourage you to check out the following link:\n http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/faq/dinosaurs.asp \n \n Best wishes,\n astronomyfan87.",

   "To 7th_Arty:\n \nIt is laughable to believe that some powerful god would wager with an evil spirit and allow the slaughter of innocent victims just to prove a point to no one. Really. Read the story and think if that is the kind of god that you want.\n \n \n Think what you want. It was a test for Job, and he passed it with flying colours. No matter what happened to him, Job hung in there. If the story of job is nothing but a story, than why is not the Earth round? Are the stars of the cluster Orion not moving apart? Are not the Pleadies star cluster staying together? (Job 38:31) This is what the book of Job predicts. So if that is rubbish, than you are really wacked! I think that Job is probably the most righteous man to ever walk the face of the world. I have one last question for you, \"Where you there? If not, why and how can you dismiss it so easily?\"\n I'm interested as to your response. \n \n God has got plan and purpose for everything that happens, and I for one, was somewhat inspired by what Job went through and how faithful he was during and after his experiences. I now know how truely lucky I am. Our God is a good God. He has done everything that we would or could expect a loving and gracious God to do and eternally more! Because of our screw up in the Garden of Eden, God loved you that much that He sent His only Son to die on the cross for your  sins so that you may not perish, but have enternal life with Him. He has given you  the option, it is up to you to take it......\n \n Best wishes,\n astronomyfan87.",

   "To Plotter:\n Actually there is good evidence that dinosaurs were created in the creation week about six thousand years ago.\n\n \n Evidence to the contrary is stronger.\n \n \nThis post will be about dinosaurs and the evidence that they lived with man. According to the Bible dinosaurs first existed around 6,000 years ago. God made the dinosaurs, along with the other land animals, on Day Six of the Creation Week. \n\n \n The Bible is not a science text. And I laways get a giggle over the six literal day **** anyway. First of all, time is often figurative and not literal in the Bible. Secondly, six days where? A day is not the same on Jupiter as here, who are we to put limits on a day for God?\n \n \nThis could be a reference to one of the pterodactyls, such as the Pteranodon, Rhamphorhynchus, etc.\n\n \n These are all actually part of a family called Pterosaurs. Plus they did not look like serpents or lizards - they looked like featherless birds.\n \n \n* Scientists from the Univsertiy of Montana found T. rex bones that were not totally fossilzed. Sections of the bones were like fresth bone and contained what seems to be blood cells and hemoglobin. If these bones really were millions of years old, then the blood cells and hemoglobin would have totally disintegrated. A report by the scientists stated the following:\n \"A think slice of T.rex bone glowed amber beneath the lens of my microscope ... the lab filled with murmurs and amazement, for I had focused on something inside the vessels that none of us had ever noticed before: tiny round objects, transulcent red with a dark center ... Red blood cells? The shape and location suggested them, but blood cells are mostly wawter and couldn't possibly have stayed perserved in the 65 milion year old tyrannosaur ... The bone sample that had us so excited came from a beautiful, nearly complete specimen of Tyrannosaurus rx uneathered in 1990 ... When the team brought the dinosaur into the lab, we noticed that some parts deep inside the long bone of the leg had not completely fossilized ... So far, we think that all of this evidence supports the notion that our slices of T. rex could contain perserved heme and hemoglobin fragments. But more work needs to be done before we are confident enough to come right out and say, \"Yes, this T. rex has blood compounds left in its tissues.\"\" Schweitzer, M. and Staedter, T., 1997. The real Jurassic Park. Earth, June 1997, pp. 55-57. \n\n \n Sorry - I think this is a load of hooey. I have worked with fossils. I even own a leg bone from now extinct mammal (50 million years old).\n \n The process to fossilize a bone is painfully slow. Non-fossilized tissue can't survive more than a few years, let alone long enough for any other part of the bone to become fossilzed! It would decompose! \n \n I trust science. I trust the Bible. When you understand what each is they work together quite beautifully.\n \n The Bible is a book. It is a guide to our behavior and to God. It is not a history or science text, nor is meant to be. What a waste of time to try and use the Bible to refute science!\n \n Science studies something way cooler that God did. He created all of this - and there is truth in the creation - more so than in the Bible, for creation can't be tampered with, and a book can.\n \n To dismiss science is to dismiss the creation and it's creator.\n \n This world is billions of years old. And God made it. And it is amazing.\n \n PS: Dragon legends were likely inspired by the finding of dinosaur bones. Note - most of the legends come from places where a lot of fossilized dinosaur bones are found to this day.",

   "Ive followed these debates with interest and ive often thrown in my two pennies worth.\n \n Ive often asked creationists in these debates to explain to me the dinosaurs, so far ive had no real response, other than the usual religious mumbo jumbo.\n \n The closest answer ive got(in fact the only answer) was that god describes all reptiles in one word and that dinosaurs are reptiles and so that explains it.\n \n so creationists, ive got a little poser for you, evidence proves dinosaurs existed millions of years ago, way before the bible was written, in fact before the creation. So can you explain this little detail in your creation theory?\n \n Come on creationists, prove your theory. Im not holding my breath though.\n\n \n I can only speak for myself. I do believe God created the heavens and the earth. We also are taught a day is a thousand years unto the Lord. Or ten thousand, one hundred thousand, a million, a billion, it matters not. I have no problem with the fact the dinosaurs lived, died, fought, ate, and were eventually wiped out by some cataclysmic event. However long God took to work his wondrous magic, and in which manner he chose to do so, should be of little concern to the individual that desires to spend Eternity with God. If he chooses to eventually enlighten us, all well and good. If he doesn't, that's all well and good, also.\n \n When the Book of Genesis speaks of 'in the beginning', it's not speaking of the beginning of an Eternal God, but the beginning of the Earth, heavens, and eventually, mankind. Do I wonder? Of course I wonder how it all came about. Will it affect my life or salvation? No. So, the question arises, why worry about it, why argue about it, and why lose sleep over it. I can't do anything to change the past. I must only look to my future.",

What does the evidence say, what evidence do we have on dinosaurs? A few bits of bones, i.e. fossils in sedimentary rock - for the most part. Both evolutionists and creationists have the same evidence, we have the same fossils, footprints, etc. So how can the evidence be any stronger for evolution as opposed to creation? Fossils can be made to fit either interpretation of the evidence. Btw, indigenous peoples of many countries accounted experiences with many dinosaur like creatures. Observation is an important part of science and always over rules any interpretation. How would those indigenous peoples know what a dinosaur looked like unless they were there co-existing with them? Hmmm? Evolutionists say that dinosaurs got wiped out nearly 65 million years ago, how, then, could these indigenous peoples draw very accurate diagrams of some dinosaurs if there wasn't any dinosarus left?

Your sense of humour is very wacked then! The days are clearly portrayed as six literal days. Let me illustrate:\n \"Evening passed and morning came - that was the \"nth\" day\". Where nth is the number day (out of six). That passage was pretty clear to me that it was a standard day (EST), Earth Standard Time. Go outside and watch the positions of the sun, evening passed  (which would be night), morning came, light again, a single day. Since God is outside time, I guess that time is irrelevent to God. But since the Bible was written for man and to man, than I guess that God would have written in relation to man and the Earth (especially since God was describing how He made the Earth and all that is in it).\n \n \nThe process to fossilize a bone is painfully slow. Non-fossilized tissue can't survive more than a few years, let alone long enough for any other part of the bone to become fossilzed! It would decompose! \n \n \n Actually, the process of fossilisation is not slow and can be done relatively quickly. All what you need is for sediments to quickly cover a dead (or an alive body - as what would have happened to Noah's Flood) and hence, fossilsation can occur rapidly; evolutionarly speaking, fossils take millions of years to fossilise a bone, but unless the bone is covered by sediments quickly, the bone will never fossilise. \n \n \nI trust science. I trust the Bible.

You seem to be a little confused about \"What is science?\" You have mixed up evolution with science. You see, science is the human enterprise of seeking to describe accurately and quantitatively the nature and processes of our universe through observation, hypothesis, and experimental validation. Note \"the nature and processes\" of our universe. There is no \"origin\" mentioned here, as we cannot observe or experiment what would have happened in the past. Evolution is not science, it is just philosophical naturalism, or what you believe in is theistic evolution (a God guided process of evolution). \n \n Creation, evolution, theistic evolution (progressive creation) are all just different interpretations of the scientific evidence and the sciences.You see, what is the difference between evolution and creation? Nothing much, only that one takes a long time through naturalistic processes while the other comes around by the special creative acts of God about 6,000 years ago. Does that mean that then, that creation could be regarded as being \"scientific\"? Everything that creation says, evolution just says the total opposite, while both sides use science to support their case. I hope that you see that both of them are just different interpretations of the scientific evidence that we observe -- different interpretations, same scientific facts, same sciences (science of genetics, physics, chemistry, etc).\n \n \nTo dismiss science is to dismiss the creation and it's creator.\n \n \n To dismiss operation  science would result in a dismissal of God and His creation. \n \n \nThis world is billions of years old. And God made it. And it is amazing.\n \n \n Amazing it is! But in response to the billions of years, \"Were you there?\" If not, how do you know what happened in the past? I know because I have the Authoriative Word of the Creator God who was there in the beginning and who doesn't lie. Instead of believing in blind faith, I believe in something rational - with a little bit of faith required (not blind faith).\n \n \nDragon legends were likely inspired by the finding of dinosaur bones. Note - most of the legends come from places where a lot of fossilized dinosaur bones are found to this day.\n \n \n Possibly. But then again this point can neither be verified nor disproved, although rational thought leads me to believe that many were actually ture, like Alexander the Great's experience. The fact that indigenous groups saw dinosaur like creatures cannot really be disputed.\n \n Best wishes,\n astronomyfan87.",

   "To jitobear:\n \nJump to conclusions!!!??? I have not jumped to anything. I have studied paleontology and worked with paleontologists at the Science Museum of Minnesota. I have read, seen, handled and touched the evidence you speak of.\n \n \n Before I start, this is my last reply on the topic, you can respond to this, but I won't be replying. I'll look at it, but will not reply. Please allow me to defend my position. You say that \"evidence to the contrary is stronger\". For one, since we live in the same universe we have the same evidence so that comment is really un-true. What you mean is that your interpretation better fits the evidence. But have you even looked at the creation alternative explanation? Many people just say that since creationists aren't \"evolutionary scientists\" and they disagree with the theory that they are un-scientific theologians. This is a stereotype, one that I hope you don't follow. Since I'm only 17, I don't know all the fine prints of the model and how to defend it any near as well as the creationists, so if I screw up somewhere, it is because I don't know some of the issues that well. The creationists are much more informed and smarter than I am! They are real scientists with Ph.D.s.\n \n \nAll creationists have to date things is a BOOK. Paleontology uses scientific methods.\n \n \n But if the Bible is the Word of God, then it is the truth, is it not? Hence, this would be far more reliable than man-made methods. You interestingly enough bring up the so-called \"scientific dating methods\". Well, did you know that out of the 200 possible dating methods that we can apply, only 20 of those methods bring an age for things that fits with the evolutionary theory. Since you have some education in paleontology I trust that you know that most fossils do not usually contain radioactive minerals, so they cannot usually be dated by radiometric means. What is usually done is to find a volcanic flow in association with the fossil layer, and try to date that using methods such as the potassium-argon dating. Now, there have been several examples where radio-dating methods have failed.\n \n In the \"Creation Magazine\" there have been detailed reprots in which wood found in \"250-million-year-old\" sandstone, or in volcanic rock \"tens of millions of years old\" has given carbon-dating results of only thousands of years. Now you should know that if the wood was really 250 million years old there would be no radio-carbon isotopes in the wood. Radio-carbon dating only gives dates limited to a few thousand years according to evolutionary theory. So now comes the question, which one are you going to trust? This example came from: Snelling, A., \"Radioactive dating in conflict!\", Creation 20(1):24-27, 1998. Also when creation geologists sample volcanic rock known to have flowed in historic times, sending it to reputable radiometric dating labs, such as Oxford, the \"dating\" almost invariably gives results in the millions of years! This came from: Snelling, A., \"Radioactive Dating Failure\", Creation 22(1):18-21, 2000. This strongly suggests that the assumptions behind the dating methods are flawed. Now creationists don't have all the answers when it comes to radio-active dating, but they know that there is something wrong with it, examplified by the examples above.\n \n \nWhat are you basing the fact that these \"observations\" are correct on? How do you know that they are accurate? What are you measuring them up against? Could it be contemporary scientific data? And how do contemporary scientists know what dinosaurs looked like when they have never seem them? THE BONES. These indigenous peoples did the same thing. Looked at the bones and figured it out.\n \n \n What am I basing the fact of these \"observations\" are correct on? The fact that they have drawn these creatures on caves and that they are very close to what we think these creatures looked like. How do I know that they are accurate? Ditto, i.e. see above. How do you know that the indigenous peoples did that? Were you there? I most certainly wasn't. But I don't think that they would have been able to do it as accurately as we can today with our computers. Remember: we are very lucky if we get nearly 20-30% of a complete skeleton. Hence with 20-30% of a skeleton I don't think that you could draw an accurate picture of what they might have looked like. So I don't think that your argument would really apply to indigneous peoples as they would not have the computer technology to show us how the animal may have looked like. I think that they observed it, but that is your choice. \n \n \nI have read the Genesis account on many occasions. I see no reason to beleive that the days had to be literal. \n \n \n \"Evening passed morning came, the \"nth\" day\". That to me sounds like a day. Go out camping, you will see the even pass (night) and the morning will come (day). It doesn't take millions of years for evening to pass and morning to come, does it? If God made it in billions of years, than He would have said so. But He makes it quite clear that He made it in six days and rested on the seventh. Many New Testament personalities took Genesis very literal, including Jesus. Otherwise, if Genesis is false, then why did Jesus die on the cross for? \n \n \nDo you know how a fossil is formed? I do. It is painfully slow. If you are right, you should be able to test your theory. Go bury the next dead squirrel you find in the right environment and give me a call once it has turned to stone.\n \n \n Yes, yes I do know how fossils form. When an animal dies it must be quickly covered by sediments otherwise the creature would quickly be devoured by scavengers and microorganisms. There is quite a lot of scientific evidence for this point: there are many examples of fossil beds found in sedimentary rock, deposited by water so rapidly as to bury some creatures while they are still giving birth and eating food. I would invite you to see and explore the Questions and Answers section regarding fossils:\n http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/faq/fossils.asp \n Hopefully, you might see that creationists are real scientists who just have a different interpretation of the evidence and that they do use scientific evidence (without twisting or changing) to great effect. At least give them a chance. Have any creationists been involved in any hoaxes, such as the Nebraska man, peppered moths, etc,? I am not putting all evolutionists under this category, I know that many of them do very good scientific work.\n \n \nThen why do creationists work so hard to refute science? Know the difference between science and creation science? Creationists dig and twist it to fit the answer they want (literal translation of the Bible), science follows the science.\n \n \n They don't. This is a stereotypical view, i.e. all creationists are un-scientific theologians. Do you have any evidence for this? Are you just espousing rhetoric statements that you have heard from someone else, without thoroughly checking it out for yourself? Or put simply, are you just believing that because you heard it from someone else without looking it out for yourself? Creation science (like evolution) uses the scientific evidence (facts) and the science of genetics, physics, chemistry, and so on, to support their theory. They don't twist evidence to match their theory, because all what science is, is just pieces of data. Take the red shift of starlight for an example. The fact is that the majority of stars have their spectrum \"red shifted\". Woopeee! What does that mean? Science doesn't tell us what it means, the evidence has to be interpreted for any sense to be made from it. This can be applied to many scenarios. Do you understand that?\n \n Examples of evolution denying science is with the Law of Causality. Let me define the Law of Causality to a simple level. The Law of Causality, or &#8220;cause and effect&#8221; relationship states that one cause can have many effects, but no effect can be qualitatively greater or qualitatively superior to its cause; or to put it more simply, the effect can never be greater or more superior to its cause. Since the universe &#8211; according to evolutionists &#8211; was an accident and hence was created without a cause. This violates the Law of Causality! Game over. Let me explain, since the universe had a beginning (which can be shown via the 1st and 2nd Laws of Thermodynamics), the universe must also have had a cause. Causality forms the basis of all the sciences. They also mis-use the fossil record. Stephen Jay Gould (\"Evolution's erratic pace\". Natural History, vol. LXXXVI(5), May 1977, p.14.) says and I quote: \"The evolutionary trees that adorn our textbooks have data only at the tips and nodes of their branches; the rest is inference, however reasonable, not the evidence of the fossils.\" Note the text in bold. These are just a few examples of where evolution denies and goes against scientific knowledge and evidence.\n \n \nDon't condescend to me, I am not confused. Evolution is a scietific theory. Go ask any scientist at just about any university in the world and they will tell you the same (unless they have a religious agenda).\n \n \n My apologies. You are free to think what you want. But it is driven by a philosophy, that of atheism (in many concepts). Evolution (like creation) uses science and scientific knowledge to justify their beliefs. If you think that it is scientific then go ahead, that is your choice. Well of course if I was to go up to an evolutionary scientist and ask if evolution is a scientific theory what do you think that he will say? Just because the majority of scientists believe in evolution, that doesn't make it right. Remember: the majority of the world's population didn't survive the Flood of Noah..... ;-) There are, however, an increasing amount of Ph.D. scientists that are questioning evolutionary theory (agnostics, like Michael Menton, and some evolutionists themselves). \n \n \nThere are many theories in science that can't be directly observed for many reasons.\n \n \n Agreed. So how can you know if something actually happened at a certain point in time? You sometimes have to take event by faith, such as the origin of the big bang, the moon, the formation of galaxies, solar systems, stars, the first life that supposedly came from non-life or lifeless chemicals.\n \n \nAnother big difference is that one is accepted by the scientific community at large and one is not, and when it comes to science - I am trusting the scientists, not the preachers.\n \n \n I too trust science. I assume that you are refering to the creationists when you mention the \"preachers\"? See above for main argument. Creationary scientists just have a different belief system to the evolutionary scientists. They both use the same evidence, the same science, to show that their theories are correct and compatible with modern day science. I am confident in saying this today: there is not one observed fact of science that contradicts the Authoritative Word of God.\n \n I've really got to learn to write a lot shorter! ;-)",

   "Many people just say that since creationists aren't \"evolutionary scientists\" and they disagree with the theory that they are un-scientific theologians.\nNo, it is because they don't follow the Scientific Method, that they are not scientists. They start out with a conclusion and then selects data to fit their premade conclusion. That is not science, that is dogma.\n \n \nThe creationists are much more informed and smarter than I am! They are real scientists with Ph.D.s.\nOh, Ah, wow. That their PH.Ds are not in the field whare they make their claims doesn't matter to you, I take it? A Ph.D. matters when you are getting a job. It doesn't confer automatic authority in a subject matter, unless it is the subject matter you got your Ph.D. in. What matters is the data sets.\n \n \nBut if the Bible is the Word of God, then it is the truth, is it not?\nThe Bible is not a science textbook.\n \n \nHence, this would be far more reliable than man-made methods.\nGiven that the Bible have suffered from translations and originally being written down of oral folklore, no, itmis the word of those who wrote down what they were told was God's word. When things in the Bible DIRECTLY contradicts what we can see with our ow eyes, then it simply isn't even remotely logical to claim that the Bible is wrong, and that what we can all see then must be wrong.\n \n \nYou interestingly enough bring up the so-called \"scientific dating methods\". Well, did you know that out of the 200 possible dating methods that we can apply, only 20 of those methods bring an age for things that fits with the evolutionary theory.\nThat is a falsehood. I would advice you to NOT get your information from creationist lie sites. Here is a short piece from the ASA, a Christian Science Organization:\n http://www.asa3.org/ASA/resources/Wiens.html\n \n \nWhat is usually done is to find a volcanic flow in association with the fossil layer,\nNope.\n \n \n and try to date that using methods such as the potassium-argon dating. Now, there have been several examples where radio-dating methods have failed.\nThat is, when creationists have deliberately misapplied the technique. Yes, I have read those sites as well, and they outright lie and load you up with deceptions. Here are some good sites for how the system works:\n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/isochron-dating.html\n http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CF/CF210.html\n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-age-of-earth.html\n \n Here is an explanation and evaluation of those \"false\" reading you talked about<b></b>:\n http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CD/CD013.html\n \n \nIn the \"Creation Magazine\" there have been detailed reprots in which wood found in \"250-million-year-old\" sandstone, or in volcanic rock \"tens of millions of years old\" has given carbon-dating results of only thousands of years.\nAnd how was the dating done? yes, I read Snelling. His claims are false, he deliberately misapplies the dating methods. Sure you can get odd results by deliberately misapplying the mewthod. That's called FRAUD.\n \n \nAlso when creation geologists sample volcanic rock known to have flowed in historic times, sending it to reputable radiometric dating labs, such as Oxford, the \"dating\" almost invariably gives results in the millions of years! This came from: Snelling, A., \"Radioactive Dating Failure\", Creation 22(1):18-21, 2000.\nYes, that was similar to the stuff I linked to above. here is that link again:\n http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CD/CD013.html\n \n \nThis strongly suggests that the assumptions behind the dating methods are flawed.\nNo, it suggests deliberate misapplication of the method by creationists in order to discredit the technique.\n \n \nNow creationists don't have all the answers when it comes to radio-active dating, but they know that there is something wrong with it, examplified by the examples above.\nYes, there is somethign wrong with deliberately causing fraud through the creationist technique of misapplication. Did you read the link to the Christian Scientists site regarding radiometric dating?\n http://www.asa3.org/ASA/resources/Wiens.html#page%2023\n -------\n 14. A young-Earth research group reported that they sent a rock erupted in 1980 from Mount Saint Helens volcano to a dating lab and got back a potassium-argon age of several million years. This shows we should not trust radiometric dating.\n \n There are indeed ways to \"trick\" radiometric dating if a single dating method is improperly used on a sample. Anyone can move the hands on a clock and get the wrong time. Likewise, people actively looking for incorrect radiometric dates can in fact get them. Geologists have known for over forty years that the potassium-argon method cannot be used on rocks only twenty to thirty years old. Publicizing this incorrect age as a completely new finding was inappropriate. The reasons are discussed in the Potassium-Argon Dating section above. Be assured that multiple dating methods used together on igneous rocks are almost always correct unless the sample is too difficult to date due to factors such as metamorphism or a large fraction of xenoliths.\n ------\n \n \nWhat am I basing the fact of these \"observations\" are correct on? The fact that they have drawn these creatures on caves and that they are very close to what we think these creatures looked like. How do I know that they are accurate? Ditto, i.e. see above.\nNow, THAT is a new one. You are saying that there are \"cave man\" paintings of dinosaurs? I would LOVE to see some actual evidence for that claim.\n \n \n [QUOTE\"Evening passed morning came, the \"nth\" day\". That to me sounds like a day.[/QUOTE]Well, it is nice that what has come out from numerous translations and rewrites to you sounds like a \"day.\" So?\n \n \nIf God made it in billions of years, than He would have said so. But He makes it quite clear that He made it in six days and rested on the seventh.\nAh, but you are relying on what translators are saying that other people said about what God said.\n \n \nYes, yes I do know how fossils form. When an animal dies it must be quickly covered by sediments otherwise the creature would quickly be devoured by scavengers and microorganisms.\nWell, that is partially correct.\n \n \nThere is quite a lot of scientific evidence for this point: there are many examples of fossil beds found in sedimentary rock, deposited by water so rapidly as to bury some creatures while they are still giving birth and eating food.\nAnd that part is NOT correct.\n \n \nI would invite you to see and explore the Questions and Answers section regarding fossils:\nI have gone through the entire AiG site and keeps up on the new stuff. Their claims are false. And so are your claims. The ichthyosaur is a marine animal, and as such, there is no evidence of a flood overpowering it. Perhaps you didn't read that part?\n And the \"while eating\" part deal with (1) Mammoths claimed to be frozen, not fossilized, and (2) fish, who thus also were not necessarily affected by a flood(you need to get your facts straight). So we are talking about NEITHER of your examples being proof of a flood.\n \n \nHopefully, you might see that creationists are real scientists who just have a different interpretation of the evidence and that they do use scientific evidence (without twisting or changing) to great effect.\nThis is false. They use only part of the data, rejecting the data that contradicts their desired and pre-made conclusion. That makes the NOT scientists.\n \n \nAt least give them a chance.\nWe have, and all they gave were lies.\n \n \nHave any creationists been involved in any hoaxes, such as the Nebraska man,\nThis never became part of the Scientific Theory of EVolution. It failed the peer review. That is why we have the Scientific Method, which you seem so ignorant about.\n \n \npeppered moths, etc,?\nI would LOVE for you to prove how the Peppered Moth research was a hoax?\n \n \nI am not putting all evolutionists under this category, I know that many of them do very good scientific work.\n\"Evolutionists\"? You mean \"evolutionary biologists\"? If they do good work, then how can you claim their work to be bogous?\n \n \nThey don't. This is a stereotypical view, i.e. all creationists are un-scientific theologians.\nThe stated purpose of creationism is to contradict evolution. That most certainly is theological attacks on science.\n \n \nCreation science (like evolution) uses the scientific evidence (facts) and the science of genetics, physics, chemistry, and so on, to support their theory.\nThis is a deceptive claim. yes, they use people's research, but only part of it. They deliberately sort the data into what confirms their pre-made-up conclusion, and what they discard as not supporting this. That is NOT the Scientific Method, but rather fradulent and dishonest. And no, your ignorance of the Scientific Method is again manifesting itself. There is no creationist \"theory.\" There is a hypothesis, which ahs been disproven, but which the creationists refuse to discard anyway, thus directly violating the Scientific Method.\n \n \nThey don't twist evidence to match their theory,\nYes they do. This has been proven and documented.\n http://members.cox.net/ardipithecus/evol/lies/\n http://www.creationism.ws/the_lies_frameset.htm\n http://www.fred.net/tds/anti/anticreationist.html\n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/icr-whoppers.html\n http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/cat_assault_on_science.html\n http://www.geocities.com/odonate/home.htm\n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/quotes/mine/project.html\n http://creationcrap.batcave.net/pbsresponse.html\n http://www.natcenscied.org/\n http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Hangar/2437/\n http://books.nap.edu/html/creationism/\n http://www.aps.org/apsnews/1100/110018.cfm\n http://www.talkorigins.org/origins/faqs-creationists.html\n \n And so on.\n \n \nbecause all what science is, is just pieces of data.\nThat's the beginning of the Scientific Method. As it progresses, it needs more than that.\n \n \nTake the red shift of starlight for an example. The fact is that the majority of stars have their spectrum \"red shifted\". Woopeee! What does that mean? Science doesn't tell us what it means, the evidence has to be interpreted for any sense to be made from it.\nScience actually have researched this and knows exactly what it means. Please don't lie about this.\n \n \nExamples of evolution denying science is with the Law of Causality....[nonsense deleted]\nDid you make up that nonsense yourself?\n \n \nSince the universe - according to evolutionists - was an accident and hence was created without a cause. This violates the Law of Causality!\nYour misrepresentation of science is duly noted.\n \n \nGame over. Let me explain, since the universe had a beginning (which can be shown via the 1st and 2nd Laws of Thermodynamics), the universe must also have had a cause.\nThe cause was, as bets is known, a Singularity.\n \n \n But it is driven by a philosophy, that of atheism (in many concepts).\nYou are still lying.\n \n \nEvolution (like creation) uses science and scientific knowledge to justify their beliefs.\nThat's two misrepresentations in a row. For one, creationism is not science, and secondly, science is not about belief, but rather about the data.\n \n \nJust because the majority of scientists believe in evolution, that doesn't make it right.\nOf course not. It is the data that makes it \"right.\"\n \n \nRemember: the majority of the world's population didn't survive the Flood of Noah..... ;-)\nAh, the flood that never happened (Or at least not as described in the Bible).\n \n \nThere are, however, an increasing amount of Ph.D. scientists that are questioning evolutionary theory (agnostics, like Michael Menton, and some evolutionists themselves).\nHmm, going from 8 to 9 is an increase, I guess <sarcasm off<\n \n \nAgreed. So how can you know if something actually happened at a certain point in time? You sometimes have to take event by faith, such as the origin of the big bang, the moon, the formation of galaxies, solar systems, stars, the first life that supposedly came from non-life or lifeless chemicals.\nNONE of which has anything to do with evolution.\n \n \nI too trust science.\nAs you have just spend several posts trashing the Scientific Method, that claim simply can only be a lie.\n \n \nCreationary scientists just have a different belief system to the evolutionary scientists. They both use the same evidence, the same science,\nAn outrright lie. They do not use the Scientific Method.\n \n \nI am confident in saying this today: there is not one observed fact of science that contradicts the Authoritative Word of God.\nUntil you define what \"the Authoritative Word of God\" is, who knows.",

   "To carla5010:\n \nNo, it is because they don't follow the Scientific Method, that they are not scientists. They start out with a conclusion and then selects data to fit their premade conclusion. That is not science, that is dogma.\n \n On stating this I persume that you know the so-called scientific method? Every scientist, including creationists, follow this method. The method is as follows:\n 1. Observation. Information is collected from the rsults of experiments relating to a particular problem.\n 2. Classification. THe observations are organised to see if any regularities or patterns exist.\n 3. Hypothesis. A possible solution or an \"educated guess\" is proposed.\n 4. Experiment. The predictinos of the hypothesis are then tested to see if they occur. \n This is the basis of the scientific method. Both creationists and evolutionists use this. You have no basis for making such out rageous claims.\n \n \nOh, Ah, wow. That their PH.Ds are not in the field whare they make their claims doesn't matter to you, I take it? \n \n They use data and information from other scientists who are well educated in that field along with their own research. Do you think that these scientists just write articles in a matter of hours? No! They study the works of all of the major evolutionists and use information to reject it where possible. Once again, this is irrelevant. The evolutionists do the exact same thing, especially on origins.org.\n \n \nThe Bible is not a science textbook.\n \n It is not primarly a book of science but it does have many scientific issues related to it. Some examples of its scientific accuracy is: that the Earth is round (Isa. 40:22); the Earth is suspended in space without support (Job 26:7); the stars are countless, i.e. people of old thought that stars could be counted (Gen. 15:5); the hydrologic cycle; sea currents; living things reproduce after their kind; many insights into health, hygiene, diet, physiology; the first and second laws of thermodynamics (e.g. Isa 51:6); Job 38:31 - Pleadies cluster is staying together while Orion is moving apart - has been verified by science; and many others.\n \n So as you can see, the Bible contains many scientific valid facts in it. \n \n \nWhen things in the Bible DIRECTLY contradicts what we can see with our ow eyes, then it simply isn't even remotely logical to claim that the Bible is wrong, and that what we can all see then must be wrong.\n \n Please do enlighten me! Where has the Bible contradicted observation? I am very interested as to your reply. You are just \"blowing smoke\" without any evidence to back that statement up.\n \n \nThat is a falsehood. I would advice you to NOT get your information from creationist lie sites.\n \n Hmm, that is odd. The article on your link states the following:\n \nMany Christians have been led to distrust radiometric dating and are completely unaware of the great number of laboratory measurements that have shown these methods to be consistent. \n \n \n How can they show the dates and ages of the rocks to be true without actually knowing the ages of the rocks in the first place? You see, here is my point. You have a rock that you don't know the age of, you apply these dating methods to the rock. You get a date, how do you know that it is accurate? Evolutionary scientists say \"Oh radio-metric dating methods are accurate\". How do they know how accurate they are? They don't know the age of the rock they are testing themselves! So you cannot possibly know that it is accurate. The only way to accurately test the dating methods is by testing the methods on rocks of known ages. But when we test the dating methods on rocks of known ages the results that we get back are thousands of years and sometimes in the millions of years for a rock say at an age of 200 years, 60 years, etc. If you don't test them on rocks of known ages, then how do you know that the methods can be trusted for rocks of unkown ages? Here is the summary point, it has been published many times in Creation Magazine that there are many examples of where the dating methods fail on rocks of known ages. Now, these tests are always done at respectable dating laboratories, such as the Oxford Laboratory, the creationists never do it themselves. \n \n So since the methods fail on rocks of known ages, why should we trust their dates on rocks of un-known ages??? That just isn't logical! \n \n \nNope.\n \n Ah, yes. Since most fossils don't even contain radio-active elements or minerals in them, how are you going to date them via the radio-metric dating methods? I do not believe that you know what you are talking about, unless you would offer an explanation to explain yourself?\n \n \nThat is, when creationists have deliberately misapplied the technique. Yes, I have read those sites as well, and they outright lie and load you up with deceptions. Here are some good sites for how the system works:\n \n I would like to point out firstly that talkorigins.org is filled with the usual straw man attacks and even the changing of evidence to support evolution. A prime example of the changing of evidence to support evolution is the article \"rebuttal\" of Dr Jonathan Sarfati's article \"Exploding stars point to a young universe\". The evidence (scientific evidence) is the fact that there are no observed Stage Three Supernova Renemants or SNRs - which is what the creationists would expect. The evolutionists, however, would expect to see 5000 SNR stage three. On talkorigins.org, they completely change the scientific evidence to state that the creationists are wrong, even though it is themselves who are mistaken. The link is:\n http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CE/CE401.html \n \n I also have another question, where are the references? Where is the reference to the original article of which the evidence was found? The AiG article has many references, but the talkorigins.org has not a single one! Usually the argument is only over the *interpretation* of the evidence, talkorigins.org has lifted the argument to being an argument over the *scientific evidence* itself! Hence, I do not really trust a single thing on that site as convinced I am that they use the common \"straw man\" attacks.\n \n I will deal with all of your rebuttals on the what you claim \"false and mis-leading dating techniques\" here. The most obvious and profound obejction to all of your objections is that the creationists don't test the rocks themselves. Let me say it again, the creationists DO NOT test the rocks themselves. They send them to reputable dating laboratories, such as the Oxford Dating Laboratory. Of course, they do not tell the dating people that the sample came from a rock that was only \"X\" amount of years old. \n \n You also claim that they purposely \"mis-apply\" the dating techniques. But once again, since they do not apply the tests themselves (because of the \"fraud\" argument) they send them to reputable dating laboratories. Hence, your argument is false and totally untrue! You and your reference have no basis for making such claims! You are being decieved by a negative stereotypical view of creationists. This is yet another attempt at soiling the name of creation and creation scientists. It appears to be working on you very well. \n \n \nYes, there is somethign wrong with deliberately causing fraud through the creationist technique of misapplication. Did you read the link to the Christian Scientists site regarding radiometric dating?\n \n More unfounded, un-verified, un-true, stereotypical heresey.\n \n \nThere are indeed ways to \"trick\" radiometric dating if a single dating method is improperly used on a sample. Anyone can move the hands on a clock and get the wrong time. Likewise, people actively looking for incorrect radiometric dates can in fact get them. Geologists have known for over forty years that the potassium-argon method cannot be used on rocks only twenty to thirty years old.\n \n This was sent to a respectable dating laboratory. So if you are accusing the method of how it was tested, you are only destroying their reputation. You also bring up the fact that geologists have known for over fourty years that the potassium-argon method cannot be used on rocks only twenty to thirty years old. What about rocks that satisfy the inequality: 30 < x < 1000 years?\n Because Creationists have examples of where the potassium-argon dating method has failed on rocks believed to be around 200 years. You should know that radio-metric dating methods have many underlying assumptions, such as the assumption that the \"rate of decay\" or the rate at which the clock has been ticking, has been a constant. In a perfect world this might operate. But if these varriables have changed, than the date recieved will be out by a long shot! Also, how can the scientists know that the potassium-argon dating method can be trusted on older rocks that we don't know how old they actually are? Once again, an evolutionary assumption is used to \"prove\" an old Earth and hence, prove evolution.\n \n \nNow, THAT is a new one. You are saying that there are \"cave man\" paintings of dinosaurs? I would LOVE to see some actual evidence for that claim.\n \n No, I am saying that indigenous and European peoples that saw dinosaurs, not \"cave men\". Well, there is quite good evidence, and observations for this; more than what I can say for the evolutionary explanation that has no evidence for it! A few interesting links have I, for you if you wanted to investigate them:\n http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v21/i1/aborigines.asp \n http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v18/i4/dinosaurs.asp \n \n or you can visit their Dinsaurs FQA section at:\n http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/faq/dinosaurs.asp \n \n \nWell, it is nice that what has come out from numerous translations and rewrites to you sounds like a \"day.\" So?\n \n If translators wanted it to sound like a \"day\" than they would have said something along the lines of \"I [God] have made the heavens and the Earth in six literal days.\" Translators do not make rubbish up. They translate words from one language to another without falsifying the words. You are accusing people of doing something without having any evidence to back it up, and is a big no, no. How about keeping to the evidence and knowledge?\n \n \nWell, that is partially correct.\n \n No, not partially, fully. \n \n \nAnd that part is NOT correct.\n \n The evidence for it? Now, why would a fish while eating say, just be fossilised? That makes no sense! You are just \"blowing smoke\" and being \"willingly ignorant\". Everyone knows that when a massive amounts of sediments flows from a location A to a location B with a fast velocity v, that anything in its way will be pushed over and trapped by the sediments and die. These sediments also protect the organism from any microbes or scavangers who may try and eat it. Creationists believe that most of the fossils on Earth were created or formed during the Global Flood of Noah's Day, about 45000 years ago. If this was true, what would we expect to see? Millions of dead things all layed down in sedimentary rock. What do we see? Millions of dead things all layed down in seidmentary rock all over the Earth! We see fossilised marine species on Mt Everest, which implies that Mt Everest was once covered by water. Evolutionism cannot account for such an observation (at least to my knowledge, I may be mistaken), but the Bible can. At the end of the flood God commanded that the valleys sink and the mountains rise. And hence, we would expect to see marine fossils on tall mountains, as they were once covered by water.\n \n \nI have gone through the entire AiG site and keeps up on the new stuff. Their claims are false. And so are your claims. The ichthyosaur is a marine animal, and as such, there is no evidence of a flood overpowering it. Perhaps you didn't read that part?\n \n You are obviously avertly atheistic and hence no amount of evidence to the contrary will change your mind. On a scale of 1-10 where 1 is overtly atheistic and 10 is overtly creationary, what would you rate yourself, truthfully? To read all of the stuff on AiG (which would take you quite a long time, btw) and no even feel that evolutionism is wrong is needless to say, quite weird. I would rate you a <3, i.e. atheistic level <3. Would that be about right? Imagine a massive body of sediments coming into the ocean . That would overpower anything! \n \n That is your interpretation of the evidence, while mine is the contrary. It all stems back to our seperate starting beliefs or assumptions as to what conclusion we will get over the evidence. You will obviously recieve an evolutionary conclusion; while I will recieve a creationary conclusion which will fit all of the evidence rather well.\n \n \nThis is false. They use only part of the data, rejecting the data that contradicts their desired and pre-made conclusion. That makes the NOT scientists.\n \n Once again, unfounded and just heresey. I will argue this point depending on what evidence you give to back up your point with. Otherwise, this statement is just stemming from a stereotypical view held by evolutionists who want nothing to do with a God.\n \n \nWe have, and all they gave were lies.\n \n Once again, unfounded and just heresey. Evidence I would like. Unless you are going to back up your accusations with evidence, don't bother saying them at all. It is just a waste of time.\n \n \nThis never became part of the Scientific Theory of EVolution. It failed the peer review. That is why we have the Scientific Method, which you seem so ignorant about.\n \n Oh pl-ease. Don't give me that. It was held highly in the evolution of man. There was not even the slightest shred that this was an ape-man. All they had was a tooth and they told a whole evolutionary story on the man; his customs, how they talked, dressed, religious practices, their technology; etc. I would give them 100% for creativeness, about 0% for scientific studies and analysis. I am not ignorant about the scientific method, nor are the creationists. They respect it and abide by it. Once again, you are accusing people without any evidence to back it up! There are also many other such examples of ape man that have turned out to be a hoax! \n \n \nI would LOVE for you to prove how the Peppered Moth research was a hoax?\n \n MMK, (okay). I'm sure that you know the story so I shouldn't have to explain it to you. But just ask if you don't. Anyway, now some of the worlds leading journals (e.g. Nature  396(6706):35-36) admit that it's bunk. This is because the peppered moths were found glued or pinned onto trees to provide impressive photography. These moths never event rested on trunks in the daylight! Even if it wasn't a hoax, this still wouldn't have been evolution. We had light and dark moths before the industrial revolution, we have light and dark moths after the industrial revolution - the only thing that changed was the population ratio. We don't need evolutionism to explain this!\n \n Another hoax that has been exposed or revealed is the idea called \"embryonic recapitulation\". To put it into English, it was the idea that a human embryo passes through past animal stages while it develops in the womb - e.g. the \"fish stage\" with alleged \"gill slits\". It has been known for decades that this idea is not held by leading evolutionists (good thing, otherwise they would get absolutely creamed in an argument!) themselves. For instance, a human embryo has no slits or gills at any stage. The misidentified grooves develop into important structures of the head and neck. Despite this fact, the idea still surfaces in Natural History Museums and biology textbooks. Now who is decieving the people?? This particular fraud was known since the 1960's, and kids are still getting taught this today in schools and universities! Have creationists ever taught such lies? You claim that creationists lie and decieve, yet you cannot produce any evidence of such things, yet your evolutionary peoples are doing the same thing! And I can prove my case.\n \n \n\"Evolutionists\"? You mean \"evolutionary biologists\"? If they do good work, then how can you claim their work to be bogous?\n \n They do good scientific work, such as helping to advance medical technology, computer technology, etc. But when it comes to work on origins, they are starting off with a fallible man made assumption. You have mis-interpreted my point. Their work is not \"bogous\". \n \n \nThe stated purpose of creationism is to contradict evolution. That most certainly is theological attacks on science.\n \n Actually, evolutionism has the stated purpose of contradicting creation. Creation has been around long before evolutionism. Creation is the theory of the origin of the universe, which is taken directly from the Bible's first book, that of Genesis. As has been stated in numerous other posts, evolutionism is just like creation, in the fact that they are both different interpretations of the scientific evidence present and they both use science to strengthen their case. They have different philosophical views driving them, so they will obviously reach different conclusions. Your point has no \"punch\" to it. You have mis-placed what science is with how evolutionism is just an interpretation of the scientific evidence present (usually from an atheistic view point). This is what I called the athestic myth of science. \n \n \nThis is a deceptive claim. yes, they use people's research, but only part of it. They deliberately sort the data into what confirms their pre-made-up conclusion, and what they discard as not supporting this. That is NOT the Scientific Method, but rather fradulent and dishonest. And no, your ignorance of the Scientific Method is again manifesting itself. There is no creationist \"theory.\" There is a hypothesis, which ahs been disproven, but which the creationists refuse to discard anyway, thus directly violating the Scientific Method.\n \n Once again, unfounded facts and just heresey. I checked out the first two of the websites (as we are now on limited downloads) and found them to be full of straw man arguments!! Do you know what they are? Straw man arguments are basically arguments that no-one uses that can be easily refuted to make the evolutionary case appear to be stronger. talkorigins.org much the same priciples - without actually addressing the real evidence. I especially liked the one from creationism.ws. I don't have time to refute them personally, but they are really poor arguments. \n \n There are however, two undeniable facts:\n 1. The sort of science which put people on the moon is based on repeatable, testable observations, e.g. of the law of gravity. THis is quite different from the sort of science which tries to work out what happened in the non-repeatable, unobservable past.\n 2. The facts don't \"speak for themselves\" in some kind of neutral arena - they are always interpreted within some sort of framework, or believe system. This goes equally for evolution as it does creation.\n \n \nScience actually have researched this and knows exactly what it means. Please don't lie about this.\n \n I did not lie about this. The evidence has to be interpreted. The scientific evidence is the red shift of starlight, i.e. the spectrum of most stars is shifted towards to red part of the specturm, hence red shift. But what does this mean? You missed my point. We know think that it means the expansion of the universe, but it had to be interpreted. So your statement above is full of the usual lies.\n \n \nDid you make up that nonsense yourself?\n \n What nonsense? The Law of Causality? No, that is a fundamental part of science. It deals with the \"cause and effect\" of a particular object. Since, by the atheistic evolution (or big bang theory) there is no cause and the effect is superior to its cause (as it has none), it violates the Law of Causality. You later go on to say that singularity is the cause. This is not true! Do you know what singularity is? Singularity is basically the smallest point that is mathematically possible to be. It is just a mathematical word to describe an extremely small point of matter. But do tell me, how is singularity a cause for the universe? Taking into consideration that by evolutionary cosmology, there is no ceter nor an edge to the universe, i.e. it is unbounded.\n \n \nYour misrepresentation of science is duly noted.\n \n Actually my interpretation of science is correct. I was using true science to show how athestic evolutionism could not happen. And no, I am not lying.\n \n You later state and I quote:\n \"That's two misrepresentations in a row. For one, creationism is not science, and secondly, science is not about belief, but rather about the data.\"\n \n Did I say that creation was science? Is is an interpretation of the scientific evidence, just like evolutionism. Once again, did I say that science is about belief and not data? You are making up quotes and information. Science is the human enterprise of seeking to describe accurately and quantitatively the nature and processes of our universe through observation, hypothesis and experimental validation. Do you see origins listed here? I sure as hell can't. I think we must be working on different definitions of what evolution is. That is where our main problem is. Here is mine: evolutionism is the idea that describes how we got here and why things are the way they are. This includes the big bang, chemical evolution (i.e. pond-scum to microbe), and biological evolution (microbe into people). \n \n You also state:\n \"Ah, the flood that never happened.\" \n Prove it wrong. You don't know that for sure, in fact, many geological features are best explained by a lot of water over a short amount of time - such as Uluru and the Three Sisters in Australia. \n \n You than go on to quote the usual lies:\n \"As you have just spend several posts trashing the Scientific Method, that claim simply can only be a lie.\"\n \n What, me trusting science? You wouldn't know the slightest thing about me, so once again, just unfounded, and un-true accusations. In fact, I love science, as my name suggests, I'm into astronomy, I also want to get into medical research when I leave school. I enjoy both physics and chemistry. And none of my posts was against the scientific method, you are either imagining this or you mis-interpreted evolution for science. \n \n Nearly there, you quote this un-true claim:\n \"An outrright lie. They do not use the Scientific Method.\"\n \n Once again, evidence I ask. Do not post such outrageous claims unless you can back them up. They are just ordinary scientists, take Dr Werner Gitt for example, he is one of the worlds leading information scientists. So are you telling me that he and the other scientists at AiG do not follow the scientific method, p-lease. Don't waste my time.\n \n \nUntil you define what \"the Authoritative Word of God\" is, who knows.\n \n The Bible of course. I thought that that was obvious. Finally finished! Now going to go and have some lunch, I am starving! \n God Bless, it was nice refuting your arguments,\n Until,\n Matt.\n \n Btw, sorry about the length. I really have to cut down! emoticon_emb",

   "On stating this I persume that you know the so-called scientific method? Every scientist, including creationists, follow this method. The method is as follows:\nSorry to be always critising you AF, but you are mistaken over the scientific method. You miss out the fundamental aspect that renders creation \"science\" a false science. The scientific method goes:\n \n 1. Formulate a hypothesis to explain an observed event or theorised idea\n 2. Form a null hypothesis that is the reverse of the hypothesis\n 3. Gather data\n 4. Test the data statistically to see if it disproves the null hypothesis. If it does then this gives weight to the original hypothesis. If not, discard the original hypothesis.\n \n This process was followed by early Christian geologists attempting to fit the world into a literal, simplistic, reading of the Bible. Again and again they were unable to reject the null hypothesis and so they came to the correct conclusion that the Earth was old. This had nothing to do with \"evolutionists\" \"godless ways\" or any such thing; it was simple honest science. Modern creation \"scientists\" cannot be honest and follow the above method, for they cannot construct any repeatable, valid experiments that disprove a null hypothesis of an old Earth. They instead selectively try to \"prove their hypothesis, rather than disproving the reverse. This is a subtle distinction, but it separates real science from the pseudo sciences of astology, creationism etc.\n \n I find the whole creationist movement very sad indeed. It does great damage to Christianity as it makes Christians look old fashioned and out of touch with reality at best. At worst it makes Christians look like liars. Hopefully one of us can convince you to stop looking at creationist sites all the time and to learn about science properly instead. Then you too will open your eyes and see how they lie to you and distort the Christian message.",

If you are doing a rigourous stats course at uni I would take note of the following points. \n In the majority of methods you can get strong evidence that the alternate hypotheis best fits the data but if you don't have strong evidence for the alternate it is only reasonable to accept the null over the alternate, you do not having strong evidence supporting the null. \n The null hypothesis is not the exact reverse of the alternate hypothesis for a one sided test when it comes to working out type 1 and type 2 error.",

   "edit:Whacky one if you are talking about testing theories in general you can mention a null and alternate hypothesis but when you mention statistics you should point out that you are not using the definition of null and alternate hypothesis that is used in mathematical statistics. \n \n As for explaining null and alternated hypothesis consider consider there is a single dice a casino. We have the data the dice came up 'six' 51 times out out of 600. Now you could have the null hypothesis that the chance of getting a 6 is than 1/6 and test the alternate hypothesis the dice is less than 1/6. Note that \"less than 1/6\" is not the exact opposite \"equal to 1/6\". Also to understand what is truly going on when you use a statistical methods \n you have to understand the dangers of taking a single sample still apply to larger samples, the dangers are just reduced.

   "To Whacky One:\n \nSorry to be always critising you AF\n \n Ah, it's all cool. I'm starting to get used of it.\n \n \nbut you are mistaken over the scientific method. \n \n Hmm, most odd this is. Because I got the scientific method definition out of Neville Warren's \"Excel HSC Physics\" textbook. In that definition, p.304-305 there is no mention of this null hypothesis. I will have to take your word for it though, as I'm not really sure. I just don't see why you would need to have one (a null hypothesis). All what you would need is just a certain hypothesis to explain an observation, and if that one fails, either dump it or re-adjust the hypothesis to re-explain the observation. Actually there is evidence that the Earth is young, but to much that I won't go over here, possibly on another thread though. To understand the creationists argument of why the Earth is not old, you must first truely understand the scientific observations, such as lack of helium in the atmosphere. \n \n Getting of subject here, but I'm sure that you know that helium is being captured from space, right? So if that had truely been going on for the acclaimed billions of years, then we would all be talking in a high pitch voice. Obviously we aren't, so this in itself is evidence of a young Earth. Also the carbon 14 equilibrium in the atmosphere where its rate of formation and rate of decay are equal has been calculated to be something around 30 000 years. So after 30 000 years the carbon 14 ought to be in balance. But guess what? It is out of balance! In fact there is only enough carbon 14 in the Earth's atmosphere for an Earth less than 20 000 years old and a lot closer to 10 000 years old. So in his evolutionary textbook Standsfield says:\n Number one, creationists are right about the facts. Carbon 14 is not yet an equilibrium. Number two, they draw logical conclusions, the Earth's atmosphere must be less than 20 000 years old.\" \n \n But remember, he is an evolutionist, so he does believe in old age so he thinks that there is a way to get around this. He says that it is possible that a greater amount of water vapour existed. When was there more water vapour in the atmosphere that would slow down the rate of carbon 14 production? And he said that there would be more water vapour prior to the Biblical Flood with a capital B in the middle of an evolutionary textbook. When was that? Persumably around 5000 years ago - better dating than many theologians! So here is an evolutionist in an evolutionary textbook saying \"I know why the carbon 14 is out of balance it was the Biblical Flood about 5000 years ago that shook up the Earth's atmosphere\". What does Dr Garry Parker say? \"Amen brother sounds good to me.\" ;-D \n \n \nThey instead selectively try to \"prove their hypothesis, rather than disproving the reverse. This is a subtle distinction, but it separates real science from the pseudo sciences of astology, creationism etc.\n \n \n There is firstly, no evidence for astrology. There is no proof for it, and I wouldn't call it \"science\". Now isn't it smarter to prove the hypothesis correct? If the hypothesis is correct, than you're in! Can you please explain to me why anyone would want to try and disprove the reverse? It just seems like a waste of time as it isn't the point of argument. What would it prove anyway?\n \n \nI find the whole creationist movement very sad indeed.\n \n That is your opinion. I find it quite good, better than evolution - in my opinion. I think that it commonly comes down to our starting assumptions. Why does everyone always \"pay out the creationists\"? I see no real \"un-scientific\" arguments. I know that we both have the same facts, and we both use the same sciences. So therefore, both theories/views/interpretations are both equally \"scientific\". That is what I have been trying to get you to understand. It doesn't seem to be working though, hmm. ;-/ We have the same observations, the way in which we interperet them is different. I just can't appear to get that through your head (no offence intended).\n \n \nHopefully one of us can convince you to stop looking at creationist sites all the time and to learn about science properly instead. Then you too will open your eyes and see how they lie to you and distort the Christian message.\n \n \n Good luck!

I must confess that some things said on this site have shaken my belief in AiG, although I am expecting a reply from the editorial team to defend themselves that should arrive soon. For two, they do not distort the Christian message, if anything that is evolution that does that. Compromising with evolution, as Dr Hugh Ross does destroys the whole basis of the Bible. If one believes in billions of years of suffering and death, than death is not a result of Adam's sin and Christ than had no purpose nor meaning to die on the cross for our sins, this also destorys the promises made by God in Revelation. You see, I am not that  dumb. I understand the risks in compromising God's Word with fallible man's theories. \n \n There seems to be a stereotypical view of creationists, one that I do not think anyone has any real basis for saying, especially considering that evolutionists have done the exact things that you accuse the creationists of doing.

As Christians, we are bound by God's Word which says\n not to lie. As atheists, lying and telling the truth are neither right\n nor wrong. This is evident throughout history. Please see:\n \n http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs/1201.asp  \n \n See, evolutionists believe in the 'survival of the fittest' mentality\n instead of 'love thy enemy'. So they are not afraid to lie to make\n themselves appear better. We get this often when they send us false\n claims and we search the claim back to the source document and source\n research and usually find a different story. So it is wise to be\n careful of what they say and always check it back to the source. Then\n evaluate their interpretation. \n \n Obviously, they believe their interpretations as fact and anything that\n doesn't fit with their interpretation is a lie in their eyes. For\n example, in the paper the author refers to Clark and Caswell's paper\n that Dr Sarfati quotes on page 301:\n \n http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?bibcode=1976MNRAS.1\n 74..267C&db_key=AST&page_ind=34&plate_select=NO&data_type=GIF&type=SCREE\n N_GIF\n \n Then they claim that Dr Sarfati's quote is wrong and that the problem of\n missing remnants is solved. The quote is shown below from:\n \n http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v19/i3/stars.asp  \n \n Why have the large number of expected remnants not been detected? \n \n Then they say Dr Sarfati lied and referred to the quote on the same page\n of Clark and Caswell where they claim the mystery of the remnants 'is\n also solved'. What they fail to tell you is the rest of that quote:\n \n 'It appears with the above explanation there is no need to postulate\n values of Eo/n differing greatly from those in the galaxy, and the\n mystery of the missing remnants is also solved.' \n \n Well the logical question is what explanation that they are referring\n to? The explanation is that IF:\n \n 1. There was an incorrect estimate so anomalies should be included.\n 2. Assume the detection limit is expanded by a factor of 3\n 3. Claims that there was an erroneous number detected by a factor of\n two\n \n So basically the Clark and Caswell made up assumptions to try to fit the\n evolutionary model. Basically they said that since the data didn't match\n evolutionary premises, they would assume that it was an incorrect\n estimate, the detection rate is wrong and anomalies should be included,\n then they conclude that this fits with evolution. This doesn't solve the\n problem (and is an embarrassing interpretation) but shows their\n allegiance to evolution over the observed facts, which was what Dr\n Sarfati commented on. \n \n Dr Sarfati was telling the truth and the author of the article you sent\n was the one concealing the truth. Talk Origins is known for doing this\n sort of thing and they sound convincing until you read the details and\n many have fallen into their lies, so please pray for them. I pray this\n helps and have a great day, God bless. \n Bodie Hodge, M.Sc.\"\n \n \nAs Christians, we are bound by God's Word which says\n\n Sound's right to me - even with an open mind. \n \n \nAs atheists, lying and telling the truth are neither right\n \n Once again this sounds right - even with an open mind. Who is to tell them that something is right or wrong? You see, there is no one, so they can choose for themselves.\n \n You can go through their with an \"open mind\" and see that they are not liars, otherwise you are biased and hence, do not have an \"open mind\". They explained quite logically and truthfully that the evolution site \"bent\" or \"hid\" the truth as they didn't reveal the full quote! \n \n \nWho said anything about billions of years of suffering? What kind of death are you discussing? \n \n We know that Adam lived about 6000 years ago - by adding up the genealogies that appear in Genesis and all throughout the Bible up to Jesus Christ and we know that He lived up to 2000 years ago. So what happened before in the billions of years? I was implying that those who believe in billions of years must also believe in a God guided process of evolution, i.e. thestic evolution or a.k.a. progressive creation. Hence, things would have suffered and died billions of years before a man named Adam ever walked upon the Earth. If we lose Genesis we then lose the whole Bible, and especially Jesus' reason for dying on the cross and the promise that He made in the restoration of all things at the end of time, i.e. as described in Revelation.\n \n \nFrom your current perspective, you hear everyone saying that \"the Bible is wrong!\" Try a different perspective, and you may hear people telling you, \"The Bible is Truth and the inerrant Word of God. \n \n \n And what perspective is that?\n \n \nYour interpretation of the Bible is not consistent with Truth as revealed to us with the senses with which God has gifted us.\"\n \n \n Actually, the Bible is very consistant with scientific knowledge and is true. Why, then, would arguably one of the greatest scientists to ever walk the Earth - Sir Isaac Newton - believe the Bible literally if there was evidence to the contrary? That doesn't make sense to me. Wehner von Braun, another great scientist was also a literal Bible believer. George Washington Carver (1864-1943) was an argricultural chemist who was guided by God in many discoveries that ended up helping many people, he too was a very literal Bible beliver.\n \n In fact, science in Europe only really started to get off the ground when Bible believing (literal Bible believing) scientists were in control, such as Newton, Pasteur, Kepler, Robert Boyle, Michael Faraday, Morse, Joule, Maxwell, and so on. All of these great scientists felt that science goes hand in hand with God (now defined as \"operation science\" which deals with things in the present, not the distant past that \"historical science\" or \"origin science\" deals with).\n \n So with a neutral mind, we can tell that you people are already biased and that the AiG scientists and staff are not what you accuse them of being, i.e. \"liars\", and so forth. That is not showing the \"open mind\" that you all talk about. You tell others to have an open mind, yet you yourselves do not have one! How hypocritical! \n Matt.",

   "To Garioch:\n Wow Garioch! Where is your basis or evidence for your statement??? \n \n I totally understand modern science, more so than what you appear to have. Where was I un-scientific? Once again, if you are going to post a criticism of somebody (or their post), I would like you to back it up with proof, please. Other wise, this is just heresey and mindless rubbish. I am doing both physics and chemistry, so please do get your facts straight. Until you provide some evidence or proof for your base-less accusations, don't comment. \n \n You are entitled to your opinion, so it would be okay if you were to say \"In my opinion your post was rubbish\", but by saying \"You post is rubbish\" is unacceptable to me without providing anything to back it up. \n Thankyou,\n Matt.",

   "Hmm, most odd this is. Because I got the scientific method definition out of Neville Warren's \"Excel HSC Physics\" textbook. In that definition, p.304-305 there is no mention of this null hypothesis. I will have to take your word for it though, as I'm not really sure.\nInteresting. Maybe I'm talking nonsense then by claiming it applies to all science, not just biology. I'll have to check into this.\n \n \nTo understand the creationists argument of why the Earth is not old, you must first truely understand the scientific observations, such as lack of helium in the atmosphere. \nBut I do understand the argument: that's why I have a problem with creationism when it claims to be science. It's not science. Your example of helium is a good one. You have it slightly wrong: helium is gradually released from rocks, not captured from space . The creaionist argument goes that Earth's gravity is too strong for helium to escape and so, if the Earth were old, there ought to be lots more helium. The problem with this is that it was put forward as a hypothesis a number of years back. It was calculated that the Earth could only be around 175,000 years old. More research was done though and the escape of helium math works. Have a hunt around for \" photoionization of helium by the polar wind\". This was worked out 30+ years ago. Helium is not evidence for a young Earth, yet dozens of creationist websites still claim it is. It is for that sort of reason that I feel creationist sites lie to us and are unchristian in behaviour. \n \n Likewise with the carbon-14 argument. This too was suggested by Morris and Cook back in the 1960s-70s. They made a huge fundamental flaw in their thinking though: they assumed that the rate of production of C-14 is constant and extraploated back from today's value. By measuring the levels of C-14 in tree rings going back 8000 years or so, we know that C-14 production levels vary. Most interestingly, the rate increases as the strength of the Earth's magnetic field decreases. First this was known about by Cook in the 60's, but he chose to ignore it as a decreasing magnetic field ruined his young Earth argument. Second, the current decrease in the Earth's magnetic field is also now used as an argument for a young Earth! A classic case of trying have one's cake and eating it, no?\n \n One thing you can always be sure of: if a creationist site makes a claim about evidence of a young Earth, even a half hearted effort at searching the lierature will throw up real science showing how it's a flawed creationist claim at best and an outright lie at worst.\n \n \nThere is firstly, no evidence for astrology. There is no proof for it, and I wouldn't call it \"science\".\nThere is no evidence, beyond an insistence upon interpreting the Bible in one particular fashion, for a young Earth either. You seem a smart man; please think about this. I don't claim to have all the answers, and working out how the Bible can still be true becomes difficult when one realises that the Earth is old. But the real evidence all around us cannot be ignored just to make our lives easy.",
