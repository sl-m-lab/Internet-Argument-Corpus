Bush says that the nerve gas, sarin, XV et al that Saddam has is a threat to us, and that Saddam could use them at anytime. So why hasn't he? answer: because he knows we'll crush him. Its a detterant thing, but the deterrant value is lost when Saddam knows he's going to be crushed anyway. The only possible way Saddam will use his WMDs or worse, give them to a terrorist group is if he knows he will die anyway. Bush's plan is more dangerous not less. Furthermore, the question needs to be asked: why Iraq? N. Korea is as dangerous on the WMD front, and also has a psycho dictator. It can be argued that Pakistan is too. 70 countries (at least) are as bad on the human rights front. What does Iraq have that all these other countries don't? Oh right, a shiny black liquid.",

Who wouldn't use everything they could in a situation like that? For me, however, the scary part is NOT that Iraq has WMD... as you already pointed out, N.K., Pakistan, etc, already have WMD. What scares me is the possibility of Iraq's WMD getting into the hands of terrorists. I consider the governments of Pakistan and N.K. more \"stable\" than that of Iraq. So my question is: Do you think that the threat of Iraq's WMD getting into the hands of terrorists small or nonexistant? \n \n Personally, I wouldn't mind paying a visit to the Korean peninsula again when we're done w/ Iraq. :D We should have taken Gen.

It's a bad idea to set foreign policy by opinion polls. 85% of our population was opposed to entering WW II before Pearl Harbor while Hitler was killing millions, and we knew all about it. That was the wrong thing to do. \n \n I bet the chancellor is relaxing with a cool glass of French wine waiting for his term to end...his people hate him. He's holding his stance to gain popularity, playing politics. Our president blew him off, he's killed relations, and he knows it.",

   "ok...\n \n dsadevil, I have to disagree with a lot of what you are saying. here are reasons to attack iraq: \n 1. he (most likely) has WMDs\n 2. he violates UN mandate one after another, and not doing anything about it pretty much invalidates the UN -- why tell people to do things if we cannot enforce the law when they abrogate it?\n 3. he has supported terrorism in the past (maybe present -- who cares?), and in the post-Cold War era it makes perfect sense to equate supporting terrorism which targets you with conducting a standard interstate war with you. In my mind, saddam hussein has been at war with us for a long time, and now we need to set an example (yes at the cost of human life), because although groups like hamas and al qaeda may not be deterrable, the states which help them/permit them to operate are deterrable. \n 4. he kills his own people -- and in the post-Cold War era it also makes perfect sense to me that war is justified for humanitarian reasons. a la spiderman -- with great power comes great responsibility.\n \n and you say he won't use WMD against us because he is deterrable. well of course. I don't think he is totally crazy. but he is also able to deter us, even with minimal deterrance. can u imagine what would we have done if he had a nuke when he invaded kuwait in 1990? if we weren't too comfortable about trading los angeles for berlin in the Cold War, would we trade new york for kuwait city, or tehran, or even tel aviv? and don't tell me his aggression is spurred totally by our belligerence (solved by reducing our middle east oil dependency right?), because he is also spurred by nationalistic and parochial motivations (a la Iran-Iraq war), because contrary to popular belief not every action by other leaders is a result of American behavior. \n \n and you say he will only give WMD to al qaeda if he is cornered. i pretty much agree. he is a nationalist, not a fundamentalist. but saddam hussein isn't God -- he cannot have his eyes and ears on every vial of VX gas or every radioactive tube, and there are plenty of people with free movement and access in iraq who would love to pass something on (yes I know this applies even more to Pakistan). do u feel ok about a man in a country like that sitting on top of all those WMDs?\n \n you may say unilateralism is dangerous and unlawful. i absolutely agree. we should have others onboard. but if France and China and Russia want to make the UN into a paper tiger, we can look elsewhere for allies. France is trying to dominate the EU alongside Germany with its posturing. It also built the very nuke reactor in Iraq than Israel had to later bomb. It also (along with China and Russia) has the most profitable oil contracts with Saddam. I don't see them as being on a higher moral level than America. Indeed, if I had to decide, if it really came down to it (and I dont think it does), I would feel a lt better with Bush controlling Iraq's oil than Saddam.\n \n you may say \"oh well people are dying everywhere and we aren't helping them...blahblahblah\" and then enter into the whole moral selectivity argument. just because you can't help everyone at once doesn't mean you shouldn't help some. while i would love to and be willing to use force to rescue the north koreans from their tyrannyical oppression, it just isn't feasible right now. \n \n which brings me to another point. people always criticizing the impending war with iraq by comparing that policy choice to the one with north korea (I don't think you did this). foreign policy should be consistent in values but not necessarily consistent in methods. \n \n that's it for now...(whew!!)",
