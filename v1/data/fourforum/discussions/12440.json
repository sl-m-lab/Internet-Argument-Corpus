   "The only reason people put down Hoover is to glorify Roosevelt, the fascist.\n\n Roosevelt, the savior of capitalism:\n \nThe country was entitled to something more bracing than Herbert Hoover's defeatist, self-exculpatory gloom. Economics was then not as exact a science as it has become; Roosevelt was no economist and in policy terms he had a severely divided entourage. He produced a smorgasbord of measures and kept those that worked. He made fairly steady progress through the 1930s, co-opting the Progressive isolationists to Keynesian economics in the early years, and then ditching them in favor of pro-defense, pro-British Southern senators and congressmen when the time came to switch from pump-priming to rearmament, and saving the world from Hitler. In this intricate process, Roosevelt never singled out specific scapegoats, and preserved the moral integrity of the nation so he could focus national attention on America's real enemies, Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan.\n \n Roosevelt spared the country the extremes of left and right that plagued every other Great Power in the 1930s. He left the U.S. twice as wealthy as it was when he assumed the presidency. As economics, the New Deal deserves a passing grade, but as crisis management it was a huge success. And in the 1930s, Roosevelt was almost the only leader of an important country who was not either a barbarous dictator, an appeaser of barbarous dictators, or an ineffectual ditherer. For these reasons, as well as his genius as a war leader, he is rightly judged the greatest American president since Lincoln.\n\n Extra - WSJ.com\n \n Conrad Black in the Wall Street Journal.",

Some believe that he was poisoned by his wife to save him from being implicated in the corruption surrounding his administation. \n \n Bush was bad, but the worst...not quite.\nOf course, history speaks for itself. My point is that Bush has done more harm to the citizens of this country and around the world than any other president. . . .EVER! \n \n It isn't necessary to bullet-point everything he touched in his term as president from the lack of oversight on Katrina, the war, the economy, inhibiting stem cell research to declaring \"mission accomplished\" on the deck of a war ship. I can't think of a thing he did to move us along in prosperity, peace or science. Maybe not the worst president in history but the president most impacting history. \n \n What amazes me is that a large portion of this country STILL wanted to put someone behind him just like him in McCain! A war monger who saw nothing wrong with the economy or the wrong fight and supported Bush 90% of the time. Oh well, he called himself a Maverick so that makes it so. To me, that is just plain stupid! And those who jumped on that wagon, well. . . . .need I say more?\n \n Politics is exactly like religion. We measure the two as how we \"feel\" not what is right or best for the person. Just like following the Bible. God said it, I believe it, that settles it! Only if that was true life would be so simple. The devil is in the details but no one really cares about the details. An old saying, \"My mind is made up, don't confuse me with the facts.\" \n \n Limbaugh proves that every day. He spews literally false information about anything and everyone who doesn't agree with him, politically just to make his millions. He mixes and confuses issues better than anyone I've ever heard. He's easy to see through unless you are a \"dittohead\" or a \"skull full of mush\". Then you're part of his \"army\" against reason. Many republicans actually refer to him as the leader of the party. Limbaugh is an entertainer just like a movie star, a recording artist or a TV actor. That's it! He doesn't get paid to tell the truth. He gets paid to ACT like he's telling the truth. Question: How far would he go if he was a liberal? No where! Why? Liberalism doesn't sell. It's that simple. If he IS as smart as he claims to be, why won't he appear on talking head shows like everyone else in the field? Like I implied he's not dumb.\n \n What has probabally impressed me most since the election is just how quickly the republican representatives in Washington have squashed every thing Obama has attempted to pass. Without even thinking or having time to be somewhat constructive in their approach, they proudly take the microphone and say he's a spender, he's a liberal, he's a peace-nick. No thought - just a republican reaction. Whatever is good for the party. . . .Screw the country! Believe it or not, even Republicans are loosing their jobs, houses, etc. It would make much more sense to work together for the betterment of everyone. The irony is if the republicans in DC would agree with anything Obama put up, they wouldn't be re-elected by their constitutents. Now that is sick!!! \n \n But then I repeat myself.",

Now that you're in charge, \"Whaaaa!, Whaaaaa! We need to work together! We need to stop this partisan bickering!\"\nThat's what I said. How much longer would you like it to continue?\n \n \nWell, how do you like it now that the shoe is on the other foot? I guess it was perfectly fine to hate Bush for eight years, but now that your messiah is in office, all the hating must stop! All those hurtful Republicans! How dare they bad mouth our Commander in Chief!\nWhew. Feel better?\n \n Well, I guess it was O.K. for you, but not for Conservatives. Typical limousine-liberal hypocrisy.\n \n [QUOTE]Remember when Bush passed an 87 billion dollar budget for Iraq? BLOOD IN THE STREETS SCREAMING about this horrendous spending by Bush from the liberals. \nYou mean the war which should never have been wagered? Yes I do remember.\n \n \n \nAHHHHH! THE NATIONAL DEBT! THE NATIONAL DEBT! What horror! 800 BILLION IN SPENDING from Obama in the first two months..........Where's your screaming about the debt now? I thought the horror of 87 billion was unbearable for you? What about 800 billion?\n \n Oh. That's O.K. It's Obama. You evil Republicans just need to quit complaining and try to work together.\n \n Hypocrits...hypocrits...hypocrits.\nHere's a bit of knowledge for you. Before Obama:\n \n When Clinton came into office, Reagan left him with a $260 billion deficit. In 8years Clinton recovered from it and left us with a giagantic surplus. When Bush 2 came in, he inherited the surplus and now we have the largest deficit ever in the history of this WORLD! Is there a pattern here? The dems are for larger government and the repubs are for smaller government? Check again. The rhetoric is opposite of the facts.\n \n \nLike I said. Bush is no longer an entity. Yet you still can't get the \"blame Bush\" out of your system. BUSH IS GONE. Seems like your blaming isn't. \n \n But instead of refocusing on the new president, you have to find someone else to blame.\nKind of like Clinton huh? He's been gone for nearly 10 years and he's still getting it for a BJ. And in 2 months you're upset about Bush's legacy?\n \n \nYet, you yourself said Limbaugh is just an entertainer. Well, if so, how do you justify blaming him for all the problems then? After all, if he's such an insignificant talk show blow-hard, he doesn't dictate policy, right?\nTrust me, Limbaugh is NOT my guide to morality or politics or education or finance. He causes me no problems at all.\n \n \nWe know who does that. Too bad he's untouchable. It forces more hypocrisy from the libs....\"Limbaugh is the hater. Limbaugh is partisan. Limbauhgh is the problem\"......\nHe's not?\n \n \n\"Limbaugh is insignificant. Limbaugh is a nobody. Limbaugh is a blow-hard.\"\n \n Well? How can he be both the problem, yet insignificant enough to be a problem?\nThis is your statement. You tell me?\n \n \nYou didn't have any trouble placing blame on the person making policy when Bush was still around, yet now you are forced to blame it on a nobody.\nNo, I still blame Bush.\n \n \nBecause there is only one person making policy. Your God. Can't blaspheme, can you.\n \n Quite a pickle.\n:xbanghead Two months, two months, two months. Obama is such an dumb*ss! :xbanghead\n \n How's that stimulous that all the democrats supported and all the hater republicans rejected in evil partisanship doing anyhow?\nNothing of what you wrote answers the REAL problem of fixing the problem. Here's a good analogy:\n \n For the past 8 years we have had a tumor growing in this country. Finally we have someone who \n 1) diagnosed the tumor and can \n 2) excise the tumor. \n \n Remember, when you have a tumor, followed by an operation to remove it, it takes a while to heal. It isn't going to be overnight and depending upon where the tumor was located (in our pocketbooks) we may need some therapy and chemo to go along with the procedure. So it's going to be awhile before we recover. Possibly even years.",
