   "Here are four very simple questions for the creationists who contribute to these threads.\n \n 1). Do you accept the validity of reasoned argument ?\n \n 2). Do you understand the procedures of scientific method ?\n \n 3). Have you attempted to grasp at least in outline and with impartial zeal, how the theory of evolution has been developed using geological and biological evidences that have been critically examined by competent people using the \"tools\" provided by 1 and 2 ?\n \n 4). If the answer to the above 3 questions is \"Yes\" in each case, do you still maintain despite it not being scientifically necessary, that God has guided the gradual process by which the present diversity of life arose from the earliest and most primitive organisms and which has been continuing for at least the past 3 billion years ?\n \n If the answer to Question 4 is also \"Yes\", I don't think there is much sense in pretending that common grounds exist for a discussion.",

   "Alan,\n \n Just a comment on your question:\n 2). Do you understand the procedures of scientific method ?\n \n If you think that the Scientific Method applies to Macroevolution (evolution here on out) the same way it applies to physics and chemistry, then you don't understand it either. Evolution is historical and therefore not an empirical science. It's more forensic in nature. Its evidence is not the type you would take into a laboritory as much as you would take it into a court room. \n Both the evolutionist and creationist have exactly the same evidence before them. It's interpretation depends on the biases and world view of the interprter. Every observation is after the fact. Nontestable and nonrepeatable. CSI needs to be called in or a police detective. How do you scientifically proove that Washington crossed the Delaware? The Scientific Method does not apply.",
