   "Sean Hannity: Let Freedom Ring\n \n I think this was a pretty good book. I like Sean Hannity, I think he is a great person. His views are expressed in the book which goes into immigration, taxes, terrorism, and things of that nature. He talks about Clinton turning down an offer from a country offering him Osama. I think it is a great read.",
