   "Since posts are disappearing anyway, let me add a new one.\n \n Now we all know that I am made in the image and likeness of God and since God is perfect, that image and likeness must also be, as a logical consequence, perfect. To state less would mean that God is not perfect. So if I am the image and likeness of God, then either I am perfect or God is not.\n \n \"But the sin of Adam and Eve caused mankind to fall,\" you will assert. Then does this mean that I am no longer in the image and likeness of the Creator? Has that Creator become less than perfect or have I evolved away from the perfection of the first man so that if I stand up the weight of my body presses down on my lower spinal disks and slowly destroys them? So does the sin of Adam merit the introduction of weakness in these disks (and how can a perfect God create such weakness?).\n \n So is it Adam's sin or possibly an old injury that began my trouble? Should I curse Adam because in 60 some years of walking around one of my disks disintegrated (not ruptured mind you - literally disintegrated) and a second was well on the way to doing the same? Or should I blame a perfect God who is a really bad engineer - isn't that a contradiction? But any mechanical engineer can point out scads of engineering flaws in the human spine - a lot less if we walked on all fours. Where is the perfection of the image of God?\n \n Anyway, my perfect image of God has cost me years of pain with a more recent almost crippling of my right leg followed by 7 hours of surgery (including 11 inches of surgical incision - front and back) to correct my perfection by removing the debris left by two disintegrating disks and inserting two steel frame disks and screwing two steel rods into my vertebrae in the gutter on either side of my spine. The muscles that used to lie in those gutters are sutured over the top, and they are not happy with their new position.\n \n My perfect back, designed by a perfect God, in his perfect image has now been fixed and I should be able to walk without a back brace or a walker in only a few more weeks.\n \n How is this a perfect design in the image and likeness of a perfect God - or was this the result of the evolution of a skeleton system made for walking on four legs that is somewhat less than perfect for bipedal locomotion?",

God's only responsibility on earth as it is right now is to keep the conditional promises of the bible (although even these promises are written in very vague language). for example, if you are righteous and prayer, your prayers will be answered. if God is bound by a promise to do something once a condition is met, but he doesnt do it, this is actually more valid reason to believe a God that keeps biblical promises doesnt exist. (of course, more likely you will believe that it was something you did wrong, not that God isnt doing his part). in a nutshell, when tragedy happens to people that expect God's protection, and when people are disappointed from expecting of God, it is a very compelling reason for them to think God simply isnt there",
