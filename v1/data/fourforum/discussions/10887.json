   "Well, in two posts by now, Daewoo has mentioned some bits about the (in my opinion, rather impressive) arsenal of firearms he posesses. From Five-seveNs to civilian versions of the P90 to the, er, rather hard to use in real life .50 caliber Barrets.\n \n Well, I'm quite interested, what else have you got there (locked up tight and safe, I'm sure)? If you care to answer, of course.\n \n \n By now, I wouldn't be surprised by a Steyr AMR prototype and a Davy Crockett civilian version :)",

What, were MIRV ICBM's out of stock?\n \n Tell me, having one, how do you feel about every FPS game and their uncle having a man-portable one in them, fired on the run?\n\n \n LOL. I have actually seen a man portable minigun. It fires .22LR rounds. As far as I know, there is only one in existance. \n \n I bought the minigun as an investment. Paid $9800 for it. Had about $2000 worth of repair work on it done. Am in the process of arranging a sale one it....$455,000. Pretty good investment in the end.\n \n I have been building some interesting stuff that kind of takes some of the excitement out of the minigun. I did a tri barrel garner gun not long ago. Amazingly enough, with modern materials and production techniques, you can make a tri barreled garnder gun spit out 1800 rounds per minute, and since it is crank operated as opposed to electrically powered it is not considered a machine gun so there are no special controls on it. I am still working on a modern version of the old crank fired gatling gun. It is coming along pretty well, but the last prototype blew itself apart (9 rounds fired out of battery). I have a buddy who lives here and is a genius when it comes to building jsut about anything helping me. \n \n I like my toys.",
