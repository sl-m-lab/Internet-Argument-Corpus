   "I've coated my garage floors with PPG Aquapon 35 Epoxy. This is an industrial grade, solvent based epoxy with a 1 to 1 base to catalyst ratio. The tech bulletin gives no final cure time and a call to PPG's tech support brought the answer of 7-10 days before operating forklifts on my floors.\n \n I don't have any forklifts and the tech wouldn't comment on regular vehicles, so I thought perhaps our resident scientist JP or another gearhead could provide a hopefully more realistic cure time for driving regular vehicles in and out on the coating? The rides are getting dirty parked outside.",

   "I just read the 35's product sheet and the only info I could find about curing rates for it were listed as \"drying times\". Basically those waiting periods alloted for the coating to be dry enough to touch, recoat , so on. The reason the PPG tech gave you the forklift rated times was basically a CYA on his part. Seven to ten days would probaly be a safer mode to go with, just my opinion though. Humidity levels, coat thickness, substrate/primer , all play a big part on the curing of epoxies. ..\n \n The ultimate test for garage floor epoxy coatings are usually the \"hot\" tire test. If one can drive up on the coating with hot tires and turn them and not pull or wrinkle the coating, you have a good product. From where I sit though, I would wait and let the cars get dirty. It would sure beat having to strip and redo that nice epoxy, if you get on it too soon with your vehicles. good luck to you.",

Shortcuts never work with defined chemicals. \n \n I did research this project, and if anyone else who enjoys vehicles as a hobby is interested in having a garage floor that invites one to work on them, PPG's product is as good as it gets for a consumer. A couple of specialty vehicle forums, reading specs, lots of web searches and asking questions convinced me. No affiliation with Pittsburgh Paints or PPG.",

Materials were only about 25% more expensive than the water-based home improvement big box store products that can lift with hot tires and be gouged with wheel stands. And in almost any color you want it. Good stuff.",
