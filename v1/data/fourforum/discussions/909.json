   "Considering that the South so strongly believed in salvery that they left the United States and went to war to protect their way of life, I would guess that even today you would still see the reminents of it.\n \n I have talked to and heard stories about what a lot of our elderly citizens think about black people even to this day and a lot of the are still very prejedious and I live in Michigan! Perhaps this is different in the South today but I don't think slavery would have ever went away nor would blacks ever have gained any acceptance here. Maybe even the North would have embrased slavery after a period of time.\n \n I'm not exactly sure why the Europeans eventually gave it up so perhaps someone could explain that to me. Maybe the US would have followed their example eventually but I think that would be just as likely as Nazi Germany turning Democratic after winning WWII or Russia doing the same after winning WWIII against the capitalist.",

   "The abolition movement began as a result of the Age of Enlightenment (which was predominantly European), when ideas arose such as \"natural rights\" for all individuals. Slavery was also abolished in Europe first because they were less dependent on the system. That is also why the North abolished slavery before the South, there was very little demand for slave labor. There were also more outspoken abolitionists in England, particularly Granville Sharp and William Wilberforce. \n \n I really dont think slavery in the South would have survived into the 20th century. The last country to officially abolish slavery was Brazil in 1888 (although the slave trade was still prevalent in East Africa and the Middle East). There would have been ENORMOUS pressure from the international community demanding that the Confederacy abolish it. Eventually it would have come to a point where the South was forced to free the slaves, or else become economically bankrupt from potential policies or boycotts against Confederate goods.",

   "I think the system would have been abolished, but that slavery itself would still be allowed today. I think the Confederacy would have implemented slavery as a non-amendable item to its Constitution. I agree that it probably would not still be in existance today, but I do think that it would be legal if anyone wanted to use it.",
