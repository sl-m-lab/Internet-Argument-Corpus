   "Karzai, the US sposiored president of Afghanistan, has promised to eliminate opium, now Afghanistan's #1 GDP component. And this will be replaced by? More US aid? We eliminated the former rulers, who had greatly curtailed opium production with big funds from the DEA using Islamic fundamentalism as a rationale and distributing the DEA gold to warlords and tribal leaders to keep the peace while the farmers starved, we put our man in place with a democracy that barely controls Kabul sometimes and now he's going to stop production of opium and heroin.

   "From what I read, the opium business protected by warlords (some serving at minister level in the new government) now controls about 90% of Afghanistan. We have 22,000 US troops there, mostly Ranger and other advanced training units, providing a thin wall of protection to the new 'democratic' government in Kabul with sporadic border raids to keep up the public facade of hunting for Bin Laden. We'll probably dump tons of borrowed money in there attempting to prove democracy can work wonders and sate political egos. And then fail. \n \n Columbia reminds me of early Vietnam. We have several thousand military 'advisors' there working with DEA resources while furnishing defoliants that never make a dent in cocaine production. They need to use the defoliants on the Columbian government and military. There's just so much money involved with wide-open US and European makets that nothing can slow production.",
