   "We know the universe is expanding from analysing the light we recieve from distant galaxies. Light sources that are moving away from us are \"red-shifted\" ie distorted towards the red end of the spectrum. If they were moving towards us they would be \"blue-shifted\", it's the same effect you observe when a car goes past you and the noise of its engine changes, but with light waves not sound waves.\n \n Some complicted maths related to the apparent brightness of distant supernovae suggests that indeed the expansion is accelerating, however no one actually knows what could be causing this. One idea is Einstein's \"cosmological constant\", a force he invented to balance his own equations that showed the universe would collapse under its own gravity. (This was back when everyone 'knew' that the universe was static and neither expanding or contracting).\n Another idea is the mysterious \"dark energy\" that scientists believe makes up about 70% of the universe. Again, no one knows what this is, \"dark energy\" is just the name for something out there that has to exist in order for galaxies to behave the way they do; they move as if they contain far more matter than we can see. Scientists think (and have very recently begun to prove) that the universe is about 4% ordinary matter like the earth, the sun etc, 23% \"dark matter\" which is an exotic form of matter mostly found between galaxies, and 73% dark energy.\n \n According to (pretty much speculative) theory, dark energy exerts a negative pressure on the universe, much like Einstein's cosmological constant, counteracting and overcoming gravity, causing it to expand. I have just read Brian Greene's fantastic book \"The Fabric of the Cosmos\" and interestingly, he says that recent observations suggest that the rate of expansion has changed more than once: expansion accelerated for the first few billion years of the universe, then decelerated for a few billion years, then started accelerating again. But no one knows why. Weird, huh?\n \n Unfortunately, you're asking something that the cutting edge of physics is only beginning to probe. I can recommend Greene's book though, it explains in comprehensible terms pretty much everything we know and was published in 2004 so is pretty much up to date.",

   "Thanks for your reply. And I'll definitly get the book you recommended, \n \n It's the dark energy / dark mass concept that I don't understand. If the universe is filled with all this extra dark energy / dark mass where is it? If it fills all of the universe it seems like we would be able to detect it everywhere, even between the stars of our own galaxy. Bui I don't beleive that has been the case(?). \n \n How was it determined that 23% is dark matter and 70% is dark energy? Or is that just assumed in order to make the math work for certain theories? Where do black holes fit in? are they dark energy or dark matter or both? Does energy have mass? I'm thinking it does, because light (a form of energy) can be bent by gravity. And light cannot escape the gravity of a black hole. Still, other forms of energy can escape the greavity of black holes. At least according to Steven Hawking. (I hope I spelled his name correctly.) So is it possible that some form of energy has no mass?\n \n Thanks for your patience,\n skybolt",

   "With certain significant exceptions, this thread has been a fascinating exchange of ideas.\n \n Perhaps someone can respond to this idea.\n \n Given E=mc^2 and the Hubble constant (H0), the ratio of the the average density of matter to critical density (omega M) plus the density equivalent of the dark energy of space (omega lambda) always equals 1 in a flat universe. Thus, as the universe expands, 'omega M' decreases while 'omega lambda' increases. Thus, 'omega lambda' is the Hubble constant. Observations of Type Ia supernovae have measured the differences between the above two values. These observations indicate that while 'omega M' may tend to pull the universe together, 'omega lambda' tends to push it apart. Thus, as the universe expands, the influence of 'omega M' is decreasing while 'omega lambda' is increasing. This energy of \"empty space\" is what is accelerating the expansion of the universe as the initial energy of the big bang has expanded the universe to a point where 'omega lambda' is now greater than 'omega M'.\n \n That is my (undoubtedly) imperfect representation of the ideas of Neil deGrasse Tyson and Donald Goldsmith from their book, Origins: Fourteen Billion Years of Cosmic Evolution.

From the article:\n \n \nIn a 1998 paper entitled \"A Time Varying Speed of Light as a Solution to Cosmological Puzzles,\" Albrecht and Magueijo, of London's Imperial College, proposed ideas that were independent of, but strikingly similar to, Moffat's. They concluded that the speed of light \"suddenly fell\" to nearly its current value shortly after the Big Bang, a change that would account for several cosmological puzzles without relying on Alan Guth's famous \"inflationary model,\" which has the universe experiencing a hyper-accelerated growth spurt shortly after its birth. \n\n \n Even if the speed of light was much higher during the time currently thought of as the \"inflationary period\", this was an incredibly short amount of time - somewhere between 10^-35 and 10^-12 seconds. During this time the universe grew from being much smaller than an atom to roughly the size of a grapefruit . \n This would only affect our red shift measurements and hence our estimate of the age of the universe by a tiny amount.\n \n Additionally, the study was not entirely conclusive:\n \n\"It should be emphasized that varying speed of light is only one possible interpretation of John Webb's results,\" said physicist Gordon Kane of the University of Michigan in An Arbor. \"What is measured in the fine structure constant is a ratio of the electric charge of an electron to the speed of light and to Planck's universal constant. Any of the three constants might vary, not just the speed of light.\"\n\n (John Webb led the team that delivered the paper)\n \none more thing. Here is a link to a wikipedia article which demonstrates more clearly what I am talking about. Einstein's equations do not predict a spead. He used the assumption that a vacuum is uniform. We know the vacuum to be non uniform and that, mathematically, light could travel faster in a \"better\" vacuum.\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faster-..._to_go_faster.\n\n \n The equations don't predict a speed but as the article says, \"That is an experimentally determined quantity.\" Mathematically, the speed of light can vary, but this is based on observations of a casimir vacuum. From the article:\n \n \n Such a vacuum can be produced by bringing two perfectly smooth metal plates together at near atomic diameter spacing. It is called a Casimir vacuum. Calculations show light will go faster in such a vacuum.\n\n And casimir vacuums do not normally exist, they are artificial constructs. The article doesn't say \"we know the vacuum to be non-uniform\", it only says that \"the Casimir effect breaks up space into distinct homogeneous regions, each of which obey the special relativity laws separately.\"\n \n So this article does not affect our red shift measurements either.\n \n \nI want to point out a major flaw in your argument however. There may be little evidence that light traveled faster than the 186K but there is a great deal of evidence supporting that particles may travel faster. I am sure you could easily find documentary evidence of particles jumping past light speed.\n\n \n But I don't see how quantum tunneling can affect our red shift measurements.\n \n \nThe mathematical model, when calculated in a pure environment does not predict the red shift.

To say that the curve is not continuous one could look at the graph of Tangent. That is a discontinuous function. At certain values of X there simply is no corresponding Value of Y, meaning it does not exist.

   "excitation quanta are like the energy \"clouds\" that electrons occupy. One can actually boost an electron to a higher energy level for example. In fact, Lasers do that very thing. They boost electrons to a higher energy level and then the electrons all drop down to the original level releasing light of a particular wavelength in so doing. Laser stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation.\n \n As far as the curve and function: A funtion is a mathematical principle which for two dimensions states that for every x value there is one and only one y value. It gets a little trickier when you start going into three dimensions or even using imaginary numbers etc, but that is the essence of it. The curve is the graph of the function. To say that the curve is not continuous one could look at the graph of Tangent. That is a discontinuous function. At certain values of X there simply is no corresponding Value of Y, meaning it does not exist. Also gets a bit tricky in using imaginary numbers.\n \n I cannot give a full calculus lesson but I think that will give the gist.\n \n EF\n\n \n OK, so this is the same thing as electron orbit jumping? The electron's (or I assume, any particle's or wave's) energy level jumps in discreet steps rather than continuously? How does this discontinuity affect the wavelength (or our measurement of it) to account for the red shift we see? Why does red shift due to galaxies moving away from each other require a continuous function?",

Could that cause a run-a-way effect? I can hardly imagine something with the mass/energy of the universe packed into a very small space. But could it simply continue to shrink until it had no physical size? At that point it would be all energy. I'm pretty sure that would violate some law of physics. Perhaps that was the trigger for the big bang? Who knows what the speed of expansion was in early big bang? That was a once in creation set of circumstances. Any way, that sort of brings us back to my original question: \"what would cause the excellerated expansion of the universe?\" Of course that question assumes that the measurements are correct and the universe really is expanding at an excellereted rate.
