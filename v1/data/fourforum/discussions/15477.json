For instance.. Bush cut Taxes and claimed that Cutting taxes creates Jobs.. Proven not to be the case by his Job's growth numbers over his 8 years in office. \n \n The Bush Overhaul reform of Wall street played a big roll in causing the recession. Although he didn't \" deregulate\" in the normal sense of the word what he did was shift regulation from place to place, easing regulation in some areas and increasing regulation in others. Only problem was that the increased regulation was in areas that didn't really have much of an effect on stemming the corruption withing the banking industry while the areas that were more important were allowed to run wild. Call it \" Stealth Deregulation\" if you will, but it's still deregulation . \n \n SO your statement that \" Lack of regulation\" could be one of the causes is correct.. but I'm going one step farther and saying it was de-regulation through lack of regulation. \n \n Either way you look at it deregulation played a roll.. although the housing Crisis was most likely the spark that sent us into recession.",

You stated \"widespread drop in spending\". I disagree with this but for the sake of argument lets assume you're correct. If so than under Bush personal consumption changed 138% vs 60% under Clinton.

Those Deficits and the subsequent slow economy led us into the recession.\n \n Economic Downturn and Bush Policies Continue to Drive Large Projected Deficits &mdash; Center on Budget and Policy Priorities\n \n Unfortunately for supply-siders, history has proven them wrong again and again. During almost three decades spanning 1951 to 1980, when America's top marginal tax rate was between 70 and 92 percent, the nation's average annual growth was 3.7 percent. But between 1983 and start of the Great Recession, when the top rate was far lower - ranging between 35 and 39 percent - the economy grew an average of just 3 percent per year. Supply-siders are fond of claiming that Ronald Reagan's 1981 cuts caused the 1980s economic boom. In fact, that boom followed Reagan's 1982 tax increase. The 1990s boom likewise was not the result of a tax cut; it came in the wake of Bill Clinton's 1993 tax increase.\n \n \"Although Wall Street's excesses were the proximate cause of the Great Recession, its fundamental cause lay in the nation's widening inequality. Extending the Bush tax cuts for the richest Americans would widen that gap further.\" \n \n I doubt you will think this a \"respectable\" source, but I do so I'm posting it . \n Why we should let the Bush tax cuts expire - CSMonitor.com\n \n This is the point I was making, The inequality in income caused the Middle class to stop spending. Whether anyone wants to admit it or not the truth is that it is the Middle Class in this country who drives our economy. When they stop spending the economy fails. The Bush tax Cuts benefited the wealthiest 5% of the country the most. The Middle class only recieved about 7% of the benefits from the tax cuts, not enough to get them spending. With the slow economy rolling along from 2001 to 2007 we were unable to slow down or stop the recession that started after the housing bubble burst.",

   "Interesting and all, but unsourced.\n \n If you would care to reference the imapact on government revenue following the Bush tax Cuts you may o'er glance the following table. Government Taxes and Revenue Chart in United States 2000-2010 - Federal State Local You will note that revenue to the Federal Government was shrinking prior to the Bush Tax Cuts. Following the cuts federal revenue rose until the recession of 2008.\n \n Facts can be such stubborn things...\n \n Also, it is incorrect to suggest that when the people retain a greater portion of their own money it is tantamount to deficit spending. If you note the revenue graph you willnote that revenue was increasing following the Bush tax cuts. What was also increasing was government spending - at a rate that increased revenue could not abate.\n\n \n Yes indeed those facts can be a tricky thing. My chart compares Income tax, business tax and deficit for the Federal Government as opposed to yours which was all revenue not adjusted and included states without showing the deficit.\n \n My results were a little different\n \n Government Taxes and Revenue Chart in United States 2000-2010 - Federal State Local",

   "Just to be clear and distinguish between this argument and mine. You are arguing that the bush tax cuts didn't increase revenues to the government. I 100% agree with this. My argument with xcaliber is that the tax cuts didn't cause our current recession.\n\n \n The cause no. I think Bush policy was the straw that broke the camels back. We can go back to Reagan and Clinton who set up the pieces and then Banks and then Bush all played their parts. Now this is pure hypothetical there is support for most of it, but that support isn't necessarily conclusive.\n \n After Reagan increased the deficit and raised taxes and eased restrictions on financial markets, Clinton comes in raises taxes further eases banking regulations with the condition that housing be made more accessible. People start investing heavily in stocks, bank deposits decline there is a push to further ease regulations. Stocks crumble, people lose their investments, deposits continue to decline. As people regain capital housing becomes preferred over stocks. Banks see problems on the horizon in being able to fund loans. Deregulation hits, banks gain access to capital through financial markets. Oversupply and demand for performance drives banks to ease credit requirements further appeasing Fed. Housing market is booming. Prices are rising to fast. Banks again foresee cash supply problem in future. Start selling loans for discount to financial markets. They perform. Banks start buying into derivatives and MBS to offset short sell on notes. Derivatives and MBS continue to perform. Banks start making stupid loans like stated income or no SSN to feed performance goals and financial markets demands. Deposits still not increasing consumer debt on the rise. ARMS start to adjust as prices start to peak. People begin to default, Derivatives and MBS returns begin to see effects, banks revenue starts to decline as market slows. Expense increases as houses go REO and assets decline. ARMS keep adjusting, prices begin to fall as BK, REO and panic sales flood the market. Banks still are not seeing any deposits, REO property is increasing rapidly, increasing expense and Derivatives and MBS are not performing.\n \n That keeps going until banks can't lend anymore freezing credit and consumer confidence to shrivel. Spending comes to a halt causing layoffs, which only makes the problems worse. We all know the rest of the story, but that is my take on what happened.",

   "I've never denied the fact that the Housing bubble had it's roll in the recession. What I am claiming is that the Bush tax cuts set the ball rolling.\nAnd you're wrong. \n \n \nWe already know that the Tax Cuts are the biggest reason we went into Deficits.. Those Deficits and the subsequent slow economy led us into the recession.\nThis was already proven wrong.\n \n \nEconomic Downturn and Bush Policies Continue to Drive Large Projected Deficits &mdash; Center on Budget and Policy Priorities\n \n Unfortunately for supply-siders, history has proven them wrong again and again. During almost three decades spanning 1951 to 1980, when America&#8217;s top marginal tax rate was between 70 and 92 percent, the nation&#8217;s average annual growth was 3.7 percent. But between 1983 and start of the Great Recession, when the top rate was far lower &#8211; ranging between 35 and 39 percent &#8211; the economy grew an average of just 3 percent per year. Supply-siders are fond of claiming that Ronald Reagan&#8217;s 1981 cuts caused the 1980s economic boom. In fact, that boom followed Reagan&#8217;s 1982 tax increase. The 1990s boom likewise was not the result of a tax cut; it came in the wake of Bill Clinton&#8217;s 1993 tax increase.\nCorrelation/Causation fallacy? Either way, no relation here to the economic downturn being caused by Bush tax cuts. \n \n \n\"Although Wall Street&#8217;s excesses were the proximate cause of the Great Recession, its fundamental cause lay in the nation&#8217;s widening inequality. Extending the Bush tax cuts for the richest Americans would widen that gap further.\" \n \n I doubt you will think this a \"respectable\" source, but I do so I'm posting it . \n Why we should let the Bush tax cuts expire - CSMonitor.com\n \nThis is an argument of income inequality causing the recession. Assuming this is true you'd have to show the Bush tax cuts were the major cause of income inequality in the US. \n \n http://media.washingtonindependent.com/2010/09/Income-inequality-2.png\n \n You'll notice that it grew the fastest under Clinton, not Bush.\n \n Seems you might have to further revise your position. Once again, the Bush tax cuts were not a major cause of the recession. \n \n \nThis is the point I was making, The inequality in income caused the Middle class to stop spending. Whether anyone wants to admit it or not the truth is that it is the Middle Class in this country who drives our economy. When they stop spending the economy fails.\nAnd yet you really have no proof for this. While you'd never admit this, the truth is you have a bigoted view of Bush and republicans so you naturally wish to blame them for everything and anything and try to work the \"facts\" around that. The Bush tax cuts were a big part of our current debt problems, but not the biggest. They were also not a major cause of the current recession...in fact, probably not even a significant enough contributor to even mention. \n \n You keep saying the middle class stopped spending but if you'd bother to do your research than you'd see the middle class spending too much is probably more likely.\n \n \nThe Bush tax Cuts benefited the wealthiest 5% of the country the most. \nGo cry about it.\n \n \nThe Middle class only received about 7% of the benefits from the tax cuts, not enough to get them spending. \nYet they were spending... \n \n This is what I'm talking about. You don't have the first clue what you're talking about. You can't bullsh*t me by typing what you think has happened and hoping I won't notice. Look up consumption here: U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)\n \n \n \n With the slow economy rolling along from 2001 to 2007 we were unable to slow down or stop the recession that started after the housing bubble burst.[/QUOTE]",

   "So first it was Bush \"deregulation\" that caused the recession. Now we randomly throw in the bush tax cuts as causing the recession. Your \"evidence\" is because they caused deficits to go up and increasing spending caused the economy to slow. Of course if we use GDP as the indicator than government spending would be a benefit. In fact, aren't you then one that stated we need government spending to get the economy going again?\n \n Anyway, you ramble on but nothing you mention is a coherent argument. You blame everything from tax cuts to job creators (whatever that is) to a bank bailout, which, by the way, you claim was before the recession hit. \n \n It's hard to take you seriously sometimes.
