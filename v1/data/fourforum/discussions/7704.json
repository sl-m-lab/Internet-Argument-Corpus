I am thinking of something similar here to Terry Pratchett's idea of 'lies to children' - we explain atoms as little solar systems to make the next stage easier. Is it OK to not confront someone with all the complexity straight away?\n\n \n The short answer is, it depends. I don't see anything wrong in not going into great detail about the scriptural support for the doctrine of the trinity, or the idea that Jesus was wholly human and wholly God. That said I don't think it is appropriate to tell people things that aren't accurate just for the sake of conversion. The Bohr model of the atom is incomplete, but it's close enough to illustrate certain concepts such as different energy levels. The intricacies of Christian doctrine are, as far as I'm concerned, a matter of personal understanding. There is obviously a right or wrong answer, but one person generally has as much chance as another of knowing whether Mary had more kids after Jesus or how often communion should be shared.\n \n What I really meant with regard to subtlety was explaining ideas as the issues come up in the course of everyday life. There's no need to jump straight in with the salvation pitch if that will put someone off, perhaps for good, but talking about say, life after death, or about forgiveness (perhaps in the context of criminal justice), or why you choose to get married, or any number of issues, leads in to having a conversation about faith with other people, in the course of which some of your beliefs may strike a chord with those you are talking to. Basically it's the religious equivalent of being a liberal instead of a revolutionary.",
