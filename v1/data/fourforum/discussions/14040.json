   "Walmart tops list of Oregon businesses with employees receiving public assistance\n By DON McINTOSH, Associate Editor\n Walmart is at the top of a list of Oregon employers whose workers receive food stamps and/or state-subsidized medical coverage.\n \n The Oregon Department of Human Services (DHS) agreed to compile such a list in response to concerns raised in 2007 by State Rep. Brad Witt (D-Clatskanie) and other legislators. The data are neither verified nor exhaustive, but DHS said the sample size was robust enough to ensure a large degree of confidence as to who the top 50 employers were that had large numbers of employees receiving public assistance: The list was compiled two years in a row, and almost all the same employers made the top 50 both years.\n \n Walmart, which last year reported an 8.8 percent jump in profit to $14.4 billion on sales of $405 billion, topped the list both years, with 468 Oregon employees getting one or both forms of assistance in 2009, and 875 in 2008.\n \n McDonalds, Taco Bell, Burger King, and Subway were in the top 10 both years, and their competitors weren't far behind: In all, a dozen restaurant franchises were among the top 50 both years. \n\n nwlaborpress.org | DHS lists top 50 employers with employees getting public assistance\n \n I don't live in Oregon, but I suspect that my tax dollars are also going to corporate welfare for Wal-mart.",
