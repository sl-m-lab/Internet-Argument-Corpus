   "Today I found out why the French don't support us... imperialism! This is hypocrisy!\n \n When the US wouldn't supply military assistance to France in French IndoChina and Suez, the French government stopped supporting us. How ironic! We wouldn't support their true imperialism and they acuse us of imperialism when we go in and help the people! We don't make these places part of the US! France lost a lot in Suez and Indochina. We would not support their imperialism, and that is when they started being anti-American. \n \n This says a lot... France is full of hypocrisy, France feels with their checkbook, and if you don't support France, no matter what you have done for France, France will not support you. \n \n Notice that old French lawmakers support the US. They know this is why the French stopped being allies.",

I think Quebec would have a tough time breaking away from Canada for starters and I don't think they would be much of a world power without the force of Canada behind them. Remember, Iraq over seas fell to us in a few months. Quebec is a few miles across our border and they are surrounded by parts of Canada which wouldn't be too happy with them both seceding from Canada or ruining relations with the US. Quebec would be insane to attack the US just because of the backing of France. Also, Quebec has a population of only 7.2 million. They are not going to be able to put up too much of a fight in a conventional war.\n \n If you want to at least make a realistic case here you will have to make another Cuban missile crisis out of it. France would have to ship their nuclear weapons over to Quebec and threaten to use them against the US. That is about all that Quebec would be good for if France wanted to invade the US.\n \n I did have a good laugh about Maine trying to take over most of Quebec especially because that is probably what would happen.",

Look at 9/11, how those hijackers slipped right through security. And Quebec has the highest provincial budget of all of the provinces (you'd think ontario would have the highest...)

   "All nations look after their own interests.\n \n To suggest that one nation is good and pure, and anyone who doesn't support them must ipso facto be evil is a nonsense.\n\n \n True. All nations do look after their own interests. I don't mind so much that France was against the war in Iraq as it wasn't in their interest for it to happen. France was making money of the Iraq that was in place before the war. However, now it is in Frances best interests to help the US to get Iraq stabilized. It would improve political relations between the two countries and it would allow France to have some room to negotiate Iraqi contracts in the future. But France is holding a grudge. They don't seem to care what is best for them, the US, and the people of Iraq right now. I don't think they are acting like an ally of the US at this time and it isn't just because it is in their interest to act this way.\n \n \nKeeping that in mind... if you want a more rational reason why France didn't actively help... and for why the US attacked when it did (given it was some time after the weapons inspectors had been booted out)\n \n Iraq was planning on switiching their payments of oil from US dollars to Euros.\n \n If one of the world's biggest oil producers started trading in Euros instead of US dollars it would lessen the power of the dollar as the unofficial world currency.\n \n Germany and France, the chief powers behind the Euros were both adamant that the US should stay out of Iraq.\n\n \n I don't like the fact that the Euro and US dollar caused a rift between the EU and the US but I'm sure this played a role in the events leading up to the war. France not backing the US wasn't a big surprise to me although they seemed pretty aggressive about it, much more so than Germany. The continunance of this aggression is what is getting to me.\n \n \nHey, have they found those weapons of mass destruction yet?\n That's one of the biggest con-jobs ever.\n \n They had tonnes of 'evidence' (photos) of the Iraqiis storing weapons... but when they got to the sites it was gone... how come there was not a single photo of the Iraqiis unloading the stuff into a new site?\n\n \n Many still think we will find WMDs. I'm not convinced they are there anymore but they still could be.\n \n If they are not though then someone has to be made to pay for this mistake. The president was basing his decisions on information from other sources and those sources have to be made known and punished for their mistakes.\n \n I think the WMDs was also just a reason to go into a country that we already knew needed to be attacked to make a broader statement. First off we needed to take away their threat to Israel so we could get them talking about an agreement with the Palestinians. Second, we wanted to have a place to station our forces in the Middle East. Third, we wanted our forces on the border of Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Syria to help fight terrorism and influence politics there in the future. Fourth, I have no doubt oil played a role in this invasion. Fifth, I think Bush did it to score some popularity points and to take the focus off his failure to catch Osama. I'm sure there are more reasons but I think these are the biggest reasons other than to prevent Iraq from making or using WMDs in the future.",

   "The US invaded Canada because the British were supplying weapons to the natives who were attacking settlements.\n\n \n That might have been true for the War of 1812.\n \n But never the less, in the name of 'liberty' you guys invaded Canada, including Quebec, thinking that French Canadians would rise up against the Brits. You invaded, (from memory) thrice during the revolutionary wars, including at least once with Benedict Arnold as 2nd in charge (one of the reasons he was disgruntled with America was becuae he actually ran the show, but didn't get any recognition).\n \n \nThe US was there for France in WW I and WW II. In WW II we were the ones who pushed for a quick liberation of France. The Europeans wanted to wait a few more months. In 1959 we saved the French Franc from complete collapse. We decided not to get involved in the French imperial wars... I see nothing wrong with that. \n\n \n Partly answering the point. France was in need from 1914-1917, and 1939-1941 before you intervened. You did so, not to 'aid' France, but because it was in you national interest to go to war when you did, otherwise you'd have been involved earlier. And you didn't get involved at all in 1870!\n \n I am not at all arguing aginst America or pro-France, but trying to put things into persepective, re: nations look after their own first. I've yet to find a nation's foreign policy built on altruistism.*\n \n \nWhy didn't France help? France, about 20% of Iraqi oil. 8 billion dollars over the last few years in profit. One of Iraq's largest trading partners, and one of its biggest lenders. They also helped illegally rearm Iraq after 1991.\n\n \n So America helped 'legally' arm Iraq. When G W Bush called Sadaam a monster, (which he is/was) some of the evidence cited was that he gassed his own people, viz the Kurds. This was when he was your ally.\n \n \n *An interesting footnote to WWII. When France fell to the Germans, the Brits were worried that the French fleet would fall into the German's hands... an action that would have drastically changed the power in the Mediterranean. They urged the French to sail their ships to North Africa, or to a neutral port. The French declined. So, the Brits had to (in their own national interest) take a drastic measure, they sailed into port and bombarded the French fleet whilst it was still at anchor.\n The French retaliated with a few minor raids on Gibraltar.\n \n All of this happening when they are supposed to be allies!\n \n Early in the war Australia invaded the French colony of New Caledonia to deny it to the Japanese (who had already put pressure on colonial officals in French Indo-China to let them run the show there)\n \n As well, my own grand-father fought French forces in WWII. He was part of the 6th Australian Division which was sent to Syria to fight Vichy French (pro-German) forces.\n \n So I am in no way pro-France.",

   "now this is just my opinion, but what would a public forum be without such?..\n \n \"boycotting\" an entire country because they didn't back you in a [adjectives removed so as to not sound biased&cliched] war is very childlike and immature. is that supposed to 'teach them a lesson?' who are we...authoritative parents or america?\n \n c'mon..\n \n michelle.\n\n \n It isn't because they didn't back us in a war, it is because they are trying to turn the entire UN against us. They are out to hurt America if they can and they are doing it politically by interfering in our attempts to get help from other countries in Iraq. So basically they are not only not helping us in Iraq, they are also making it harder for us to get help from anyone else in Iraq. The French government is out to alienate the US from the rest of the UN. They are clearly an enemy of the US and as such I don't think US citizens should support their regime.",

You, of course, must imagine it said with a significant scottish accent. They are \"Cheese Eating Surrender Monkeys.\"\n \n They have never won a war, not since Napolean and even he was eventually defeated. They have not done well since. Is there a war they did not surrender in? If I am wrong please say so. I am not certain on that statistic.\n \n However, I find it very interesting that the French germans and Russians seem to be joined on this one while no one else in Europe is. I have seen a news story or two inidicating that the French have sold arms (as have the russians and germans) to Iraq. Would it not be interesting to find such things in the country as we move toward their government. \n \n Undoubtedly if France were to need the US aid in the future they would likely get it. I think now is the time to remove them from our collective pocket books.",
