   "There are several supposed reasons why housing prices are reasonable and supportable. Basically, \"Things are different this time.\" Yeah, right.\n \n I'll start with one of the more common myths: \"Rising incomes support rising house prices.\"\n \n I pulled income data from the Census Bureau and compared it to OFHEO's House Price Index. Here's the visual:\n \n http://home-economics-us.blogspot.com\n \n The data is from 1975 through 2005. Not surprisingly, the current trends and levels are far from any past experiences. The graph shows HPI/median income (left scale and pink line) and HPI/mean income (right scale and blue line).\n \n Home affordability relative to income is at historic low levels. The ratios were stable to slightly declining for 25 years, but the bubble has caused substantial deterioration in affordability.\n \n The ratios have been impacted by loose underwriting standards and very low mortgage rates. The regulators are in the process of stopping the loose underwriting practices, and interest rates won't likely return to historic low levels. Unless reversion to the mean has been eliminated, home prices are going to fall sharply.\n \n There is some irony in all of this:\n 1. The mainstream media and government bureaucrats frequently tout the fact that American income growth is deteriorating in real terms.\n 2. Homeownership is at an all time high of about 69% of households.\n 3. Home affordability relative to income has declined rapidly and is at historic low levels.\n \n Who's telling lies? Nobody. Loose underwriting and low mortgage rates have yielded a perverse housing market.\n \n Jeff",
