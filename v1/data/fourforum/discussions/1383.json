   "To start with, I am an American.\n I used to love being an american, being free, loving the world as it loved me, it's child. Because we are all children of the world. People in other countries, sure... they have tons of hate and anger and regression and surpression and all that good stuff us americans like to get involved with, but fellow americans, I have bad news for you. I am ashamed to be an american. I am ashamed for many reasons but one, is that I do not believe we will ever achieve peace fully. Not only with the middle east (or at least not until we run that country now too). Anyway, not only will we not achieve peace with them, we will never even achieve peace within our own sandy shores and rocky mountains. We hate just as much as everyone else, except... america does not know how to control it. It's sad really, to live in a country I care the least about. I am sorry for all the wrong we have ever caused... NOT TO SAY I THINK IT IS OKAY WHAT THOSE :xcensored did on 9/11 was anything good. I hate them for that, truly truly hate them and I believe that slowly they will all die horrible horrible deaths. But, we are the most evil country in all the world and I believe that in order to achieve peace with anyone, we must first all sleep for years, then wake up and have 2 cups of pure black coffee and then get smacked upside the head for another couple years, then watch cartoons for a few months, drink somemore coffee and get and give at least 3 hugs. Yes... then we will become humans once more.",

So who are we helping really? The people who we owe money aren't going to come out ahead, so we're not really helping as much as we think we are.\n \n This 'helping' other nations is part of the political show. I'm sure most of the people in charge of administrating this aid don't care. The citizens might care, but that's why they're doing it. Welcome to the wonderful world of politics.\n \n On the front page you see \"America aids earthquaqe victims\" or whatever. Go a few pages in, and you'll see \"Bombs kill so and so many victims\". The leaders of US help, so they can make the front page for being honest and loving people, only to cover up the bombs they're dropping a few miles off. Ironic, isn't it?",
