   "you all seem to be missing the crux of my argument. To say that free will is god's \"greatest\" gift is one thing, but can a good god, who is completely and totally good, create evil? It is impossible. Evil is wholly outside of God, and if nothing exists (thus the ex nihilo section) then how can evil be created if not by God?\n \n This argument just blows away the traditional understanding of God as being \"all good\" or \"all powerful\" or \"all knowing\". We are not able to tell which one goes, just that AT LEAST ONE of them must go. Of course Christian understanding would say that none of them must go.\n \n The Catholic Church does have an interesting solution to this dilemma found in St. Augustine (Confessions 7:3-5).... deny that evil exists. Evil is the nothingness from which God created good. Evil is a lack... a deficiently of goodness (or God), to quote a leading Augustinian scholar, P.M. Farrell:\"evil is described as privation of good... Privation is real - blindness, the lack of limb, the passing of colour from the decaying rose. This description will be found to be valid of evil universally.\"\n \n Now this is A reasonable explanation, but it would be of no comfort to evangelical/fundamentalist Christians who view evil as something that does exist (read Satan).

   "We cannot contain God in our perception of life, therefore, we cannot judge His actions based on our cradle-to-the-grave mentality. There is no opposite of God even though there are numerous oppositions to Him. Evil is the opposite of good - in simple terms, but there is much more to evil and good than mere perceptions of simplicity.\n First of all, we can see good and evil and judge it accordingly in respect to our character, which, in this case, is our frame of mind. Once we establish what we deem to be good and evil, then is takes drastic measures to change our views, which would leave the door open for either spiritual phenomenon or logical means. If we delve in to the spiritual aspects and do so with the desire to learn more (and have the mental capability to comprehend it) then we force ourselves to test it and see if it works, then how it works and by whom or we take the logical approach and reason with it. Either way before we can make a decision we have to examine the evidence.\n \n Now, back to the topic. Paul said in Romans 8:28 (paraphrased): \"We know that all things (good and evil) work together for the good for those that love God, to those that are the called according to His purpose.\" God uses Evil to bring about Good because He sees the \"big picture\". Why does Evil need to be part of the picture? Because without the evil that Satan is and without those powers of darkness there is no way that man, who has the gift of free will, could know God. Many have said that if God was good, then evil would have been destroyed in much the same way we destroy fireants that we see gathering around our homes, but it's not the same thing. God needs us to make up our own minds whether or not to follow him. We don't necessarily have to join the evil forces to become lost and undone; we would simply have to turn away from God. In this way he allows us to go through hard times, allows evil to work us over, but in the end, it brings us closer to Him - and not because He's a sadistic entity that loves pain, but because He loves us and wants us to know Him on our own terms.\n \n And as far as Judas Iscariot goes, God knew the spirit and soul of Judas; He knew that Judas loved that little ride he was taking with the other disciples - that ride full of miracles and wonders. And He also knew that when it came time for Satan to tempt Him, that Judas' character could not withstand the dark enticement and would fall prey to it.

   "To be fair, you could argue that omnipotence implies omniscience.\n \n The actual problem is that these terms are pretty meaningless. If a good god is omnipotent, he is able to do anything.

But then what do we mean by good.\n \n Can God make a rule He can't break etc. etc.\n \n This is by no means a disproof, its a bracketing of God and placing Him effectively outside of proof or disproof\n\n the definition of omnipotent has been \"toned down\" to now mean \"the ability to do anything that is possible\". therefore, the ability to create a round square would not be a requirement for an omnipotent god. the problem now is \"what EXACTLY is possible?\" but thats another discussion.\n \n anyway, god has been known to change the laws of morality. there were times when killing was the righteous thing to do, and showing mercy was a sin punishable by death (joshua 7, 1 samuel 15). also, god commanded his people to steal, plunder, take slaves, and a number of what we would consider bad deeds. if you really think about it, morality is nothing more than obeying what god says (or more accurately, what the prophets/preachers/bible tells you god says). of course the problem is that since sometimes god might say something totally contrary to what he said before (like thou shalt not steal/take the jewelry from the egyptians), you really never know what is morally right at any point in time, unless you have somebody/something available update you on what god said",

Man has inside him a living spirit and soul that does not belong here on earth. Since our inner-man is the real person that we are, then that real person came directly from God for the sole purpose of deciding for himself where he wants to go. Most of the time our spirit-man yearns for God in some way or another. But, during this cycle of temporary life we tend to want to gather information more of the carnal than of the spiritual - it's human nature to do so. That is why God has to keep His plan on a specific route. He knows what's best for us and how we can accomplish this greater good, but can do nothing but ask that we accept Him as our God and Savior and extend to us His blessings and perform those promises that He has already made.\n If He has to manipulate the powers of darkness in order to keep His plan on track, He'll do it. But with humans, He will not break His promise and will not remove the power of free will. The powers of darkness entered into Judas and manipulated his thoughts to betray Jesus. This God foreknew. To accomplish His Word, written to man earlier and documented in the Old Testament, God saw fit that it be done by Judas' own choosing.

   "you all seem to be missing the crux of my argument. To say that free will is god's \"greatest\" gift is one thing, but can a good god, who is completely and totally good, create evil? It is impossible. Evil is wholly outside of God, and if nothing exists (thus the ex nihilo section) then how can evil be created if not by God?\n \n This argument just blows away the traditional understanding of God as being \"all good\" or \"all powerful\" or \"all knowing\". We are not able to tell which one goes, just that AT LEAST ONE of them must go. Of course Christian understanding would say that none of them must go.\n \n The Catholic Church does have an interesting solution to this dilemma found in St. Augustine (Confessions 7:3-5).... deny that evil exists. Evil is the nothingness from which God created good. Evil is a lack... a deficiently of goodness (or God), to quote a leading Augustinian scholar, P.M. Farrell:\"evil is described as privation of good... Privation is real - blindness, the lack of limb, the passing of colour from the decaying rose. This description will be found to be valid of evil universally.\"\n \n Now this is A reasonable explanation, but it would be of no comfort to evangelical/fundamentalist Christians who view evil as something that does exist (read Satan). Which means, that for those who do not want to take the Catholic exit strategy, my evil argument still holds water.\n\n Evil is not outside of god, he designated satan as the posterchild so to speak for evil, because it just so happened that satan was jealous of humans. After all, satan is just another child of god. Nothing more than a jealous angel. Possibly a rebellious teenager? Mayabe in the future, They will make amends, and the world will be a better place?

Your statement about 'being all knowing' not making it mutally exlusive, when coupled with 'all powerful' is incorrect.\n\n it does not. the point is that good cannot exist without evil, because good and evil are relative to each other. if everything was peachy and dandy all the time, then good wouldnt exist. god being all-knowing does not affect the existence of good where evil exists and vice versa",

I think not!\n\n gravity has nothing to do with free will. there are certain consequences that are inevitable once an action is made. knowing the consequences afford us the information on which to base these choices. if i drop a rock, it will fall downward. if i plant an apple seed. it will grow into an apple tree. if i drink a lot of alcohol, ill get drunk. these are consequences to actinos. the actions themselves are what we choose to do, the consequences that follow are simply the aftermath of our actions. it does not in any way affect free will. in fact, it enhances free will because we can make informed decisions rather than every action being one of trial and error",
