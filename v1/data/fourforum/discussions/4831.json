Most people that believe every word in the bible usually do it in a reasonable fashion. If a scientist tells them that a dog cannot live of fruit they do not say that contradicts predators eating fruit in the garden of eden. . Stating inbreeding exists does contradict the bible where adams children and Noahs animals interbred without any problems. Fundamentalists don't object when scientists that pandas are endangered and low numbers will make inbreeding a problem, If they think about the contradiction at all they would just write it of as the lord making the universe act differently back then. I don't think that is stupid behaviour. \n \n To be frank someone can use the bible as their guidebook for life without being stupid but if they check all the references for moneylenders in the bible and use that as a sole guide for picking a homeloan they are stupid.

I have no more proof in your existence than others have in God. As you have no way to prove my existence. Even if we meet in person this will not change, whether you subscribe to the ideation of the waking dream or more recently popularlized as the Matrix. Note though that even this does not disprove anything as Berkely (sp) suggested that reality, all that we perceive are words of God. For example, when you hear the word \"home\" an image comes to mind internally. The word of God is perceived externally. An interesting analysis.\n Thus i highlighted the crux of your argument as i perceived them to be and applied it against you. which to me demonstrate a certain flaw in the reasoning, as well as to suggest that the inability to prove does not mean the inexistence of X, whether it be God, you, me, or \"true\" philosophy.\n \n i'd also caution you from adopting the use of \"fallacious\" as others here are wont to do, because it usually connote only a superficial analysis of what is posted and an overly quick dismissal, and from that you get nothing in gained knowledge or understanding.\n \n if you can appreciate this, then we can continue. otherwise i'll treat you as i treat Duo_boy.",

   "For analysis purposes, I'll make a summary of our argument so far.\n \n Post # 1 (Me):\n \n I said that it is up the the individual for him or her to determine how he or she wants to live. If they want to live with a philosophy already written out for them, that's great. \n \n If the person doesn't want to live like, that's great too.\n \n I called the relationship between the person and God \"imaginary\", for you comment on it later.\n \n Post # 2 (You):\n \n You replied to Zardoz's post by saying that you should kill the people who do not want to convert to a certain religion. \n \n Post # 3 (Me):  \n \n I replied to your statement saying that there is no \"true\" philosophy, meaning a standarized philosophy that everyone follows.\n \n Post # 4 (You):\n \n You ask me if I took the philosophy class in community college.\n \n Post # 5 (Me):\n \n From your two word comment in Post # 4, I thought you were alluding to assumption that since I took the class in a community college, it was wrong. So, I replied that you were wrong to make that assumption.\n \n Post # 6 (You):\n \n You explain in further detail on Post # 4, saying that I misunderstood the class. \n \n Then, you say that there is no such thing as a first lesson in philosophy, thinking that when I said first lesson, I meant a universal first lesson. \n \n You also say that there is no such thing as \"truth\".\n \n You say that you don't believe that I exist.\n \n Post # 7 (Me):\n \n I replied that it does not matter if I misunderstood the class, because it does not weaken or strengthen my argument, and I said that I did not understand your statement about me not existing.\n \n Post # 8 (You):\n \n You respond to Duo_Maxwell's post by calling him \"duo boy\", saying that his argument was the fallacious one.\n \n You respond to me saying that if there was no truth in philosophy, then there is no such thing as existence.\n \n From the above comment, you conclude that I am not real as God.\n \n Then you say you don't believe the above two comments you made.\n \n Post # 9 (You):\n \n You say that Duo_Maxwell said your statement did not make sense and declared it a fallacious argument, he is wrong.\n \n You address a challenge to me and Duo_Maxwell to keep up in your argument.\n \n Post # 10 (You):\n \n On a side note, this is your longest post.\n \n You say that you like community colleges because they are better then Ivy League ones.\n \n You say that first lesson in philosophy is not that there is no \"true\" philosophy, but is actually explaining what philosophy is and isn't.\n \n You refer back to my diction of the word \"imaginary\", saying that I chose that word specifically to cast doubt on the existence of God.\n \n You say there is no way to \"prove\" something's existence, because there is always the possibility that one is dreaming. Then you say, that that does not \"disprove\" the existence of things because there is the possibility that reality is actually perception of the words of God.\n \n You say that you have showed me the flaw of my argument, saying that you have used it against me. From this, you conclude that just because you cannot prove something, it does not mean it doesn't exist.\n \n You say that one should not use the word \"fallacious\" because it just means that the person is not reading closely enough.\n \n Finally, you say that if I follow your example, then you won't treat me badly.\n \n Post # 11 (Me):\n \n I try to summarize what you have said. My summary being, since we cannot prove we exist, and we cannot prove God exists, God is real as we are.\n \n I say that in science, regarding the existence of things, scientists apply Ocaam's Razor.\n \n Post # 12 (You):\n \n You say that my summary is incorrect, saying that God cannot be proven to exist, as we cannot be proven to exist. Then you say that empiricism (the view that experience is the only source of knowledge) cannot disprove God's existence.\n \n You say science discovers new laws.\n \n Your second sentece doesn't make sense, so I guess you mean that science also suggests the existence of new laws before the new laws are percieved.\n \n You say that Ocaam's razor describes things in the system, but does not accuarately describe the system itself.\n \n Post # 13 (Me):\n \n I thought that we had reached an agreement in that the existence of God can not be proven or disproven.\n \n From that fact, I personally think that since God cannot be proven or disproven, it doesn't matter if he does exist at all. I make a presumption that you think he does exist because he cannot be disproven.\n \n I say that Ocaam's Razor is used because hypotheses cannot progress if there is always the doubt that something that is bluntly there but actually isn't.\n \n I say that hypotheses are considered \"true\" when the data that supports it is the majority of the data.\n \n Post # 12 (You):\n \n You claim that you actually believe that the existence of God can be proven or disproven.\n \n You say that in your opinion, it is stupid to think that God does not exist.\n \n You then say that perception by the senses is not accurate enough.\n \n You say that \"good\" science is where all the data agree with each other.\n \n You reply to Irvine's post, which I don't feel like translating.\n \n Post # 13 (Me):\n \n I ask you to stop pressing enter after every sentence, even if it does not start a new idea, becuase it is hard to quote from that.\n \n I say that if your beliefs make you happy, then go for it.\n \n I say that scientists have the make the assumption that things exist, or else science cannot progress.\n \n I say that in most experiments, there will always be data that does not agree with the majority.\n \n Post # 14 (You):\n \n You claim that you were pointing out the error of my argument. \n \n You say that perception is not sufficient for metaphysics.\n \n You say that the usual standard in science is within 5% accuracy.\n \n Post # 15 (Me):\n \n I ask you to explain to me what you are talking about.\n \n I say that metaphysics does not \"prove\" God's existence.\n \n Post # 16 (You):\n \n You claim that you have already explained it before.\n \n You say that it is wrong to use empirics to \"disprove\" the existence of God.\n \n End\n \n HS, that took a long time to write. Huh... Looking back, a lot of what you said either didn't make sense, was hard to understand, or didn't flow logically.\n \n Since its late, I'll make an analysis of your argument later. I haven't checked other posts and forums, but do I get the award for the longest post ever (without pasted quotes)?\n \n Edit: Alright, I think I got it. This whole argument was started my my use of the word \"imaginary\". By the dictionary definition, the relationship really is imaginary. They have never percieved God physically in any way, other than in the imagination, therefore imaginary. You argued that metaphysically, we are imaginary too. However, that does not strengthen or weaken my saying that God is imaginary, because people being imaginary does not make God more real, or more imaginary.\n \n Then for some reason, we got into an argument about existence and how existence is determined in science and other unrelated stuff. \n \n I don't feel like talking about this anymore, so lets reach an agreement:\n \n God can not be proven or disproven.\n \n People are free to choose how they want to live.\n \n Ok?",

Does anyone actually no a human being that could not see through creation science all by themselves and has opinions on science you consider worthwhile. Currently most people think I am the opposite, I can see through creation science but my opinions about science are not worth anything ;)\n\n \n Albert Einstein, for one, believed in God. But ya know, he's only the most noted physicist of all time. Perhaps you would feel better about your misconception were I to stop there. You could perhaps say that Einstein didn't really have a clue about the universe. Then I would offer you this list of chronological order including ten other of the most notable scientists in history. I honestly hope this ruins your day, but I doubt you're smart enough for that. This is copied and pasted from http://www.godandscience.org/apologetics/sciencefaith.html\n \n 1) Nicholas Copernicus (1473-1543)\n Copernicus was the Polish astronomer who put forward the first mathematically based system of planets going around the sun. He attended various European universities, and became a Canon in the Catholic church in 1497. His new system was actually first presented in the Vatican gardens in 1533 before Pope Clement VII who approved, and Copernicus was urged to publish around this time. Copernicus was never under any threat of religious persecution - and was urged to publish both by Catholic Bishop Guise, Cardinal Schonberg, and the Protestant Professor George Rheticus. Copernicus referred sometimes to God in his works, and did not see his system as in conflict with the Bible. \n \n 2) Johannes Kepler (1571-1630)\n Kepler was a brilliant mathematician and astronomer. He did early work on light, and established the laws of planetary motion about the sun. He also came close to reaching the Newtonian concept of universal gravity - well before Newton was born! His introduction of the idea of force in astronomy changed it radically in a modern direction. Kepler was an extremely sincere and pious Lutheran, whose works on astronomy contain writings about how space and the heavenly bodies represent the Trinity. Kepler suffered no persecution for his open avowal of the sun-centered system, and, indeed, was allowed as a Protestant to stay in Catholic Graz as a Professor (1595-1600) when other Protestants had been expelled! \n \n 3) Galileo Galilei (1564-1642)\n Galileo is often remembered for his conflict with the Roman Catholic Church. His controversial work on the solar system was published in 1633. It had no proofs of a sun-centered system (Galileo's telescope discoveries did not indicate a moving earth) and his one \"proof\" based upon the tides was invalid. It ignored the correct elliptical orbits of planets published twenty five years earlier by Kepler. Since his work finished by putting the Pope's favorite argument in the mouth of the simpleton in the dialogue, the Pope (an old friend of Galileo's) was very offended. After the \"trial\" and being forbidden to teach the sun-centered system, Galileo did his most useful theoretical work, which was on dynamics. Galileo expressly said that the Bible cannot err, he saw his system as concerning the issue of how the Bible should be interpreted. \n \n 4) Rene Descartes (1596-1650)\n Descartes was a French mathematician, scientist and philosopher who has been called the father of modern philosophy. His school studies made him dissatisfied with previous philosophy: He had a deep religious faith as a Catholic, which he retained to his dying day, along with a resolute, passionate desire to discover the truth. At the age of 24 he had a dream, and felt the vocational call to seek to bring knowledge together in one system of thought. His system began by asking what could be known if all else were doubted - suggesting the famous \"I think therefore I am\". Actually, it is often forgotten that the next step for Descartes was to establish the near certainty of the existence of God - for only if God both exists and would not want us to be deceived by our experiences can we trust our senses and logical thought processes. God is, therefore, central to his whole philosophy. What he really wanted was to see his philosophy adopted as standard Catholic teaching. Rene Descartes and Francis Bacon (1561-1626) are generally regarded as the key figures in the development of scientific methodology. Both had systems in which God was important, and both seem more devout than the average for their era. \n \n 5) Isaac Newton (1642-1727)\n In optics, mechanics, and mathematics, Newton was a figure of undisputed genius and innovation. In all his science (including chemistry) he saw mathematics and numbers as central. What is less well known is that he was devoutly religious and saw numbers as involved in understanding from the Bible God's plan for history. He did a lot of work on biblical numerology, and, though aspects of his beliefs were not orthodox, he thought theology very important. In his system of physics, God is essential to the nature and absoluteness of space. In Principia he stated, \"The most beautiful system of the sun, planets, and comets, could only proceed from the counsel and dominion on an intelligent and powerful Being.\" \n \n 6) Robert Boyle (1791-1867)\n One of the founders and key early members of the Royal Society, Boyle gave his name to \"Boyle's Law\" for gasses, and also wrote an important work on chemistry. The Encyclopedia Britannica says of him: \"By his will he endowed a series of Boyle lectures, or sermons, which still continue, \"for proving the Christian religion against notorious infidels.\"... As a devout Protestant, Boyle took a special interest in promoting the Christian religion abroad, giving money to translate and publish the New Testament into Irish and Turkish. In 1690 he developed his theological views in The Christian Virtuoso, which he wrote to show that the study of nature was a central religious duty.\" Boyle wrote against atheists in his day (the notion that atheism is a modern invention is a myth), and was clearly much more devoutly Christian than the average in his era. \n \n 7) Michael Faraday (1791-1867)\n The son of a blacksmith who became one of the greatest scientists of the 19th century. His work on electricity and magnetism not only revolutionized physics, but has led to so much in our lifestyles today which depend on them (including computers and telephone lines and so Web sites). Faraday was a devoutly Christian member of the Sandemanians, which significantly influenced upon him and strongly affected the way in which he approached and interpreted nature. The Sandemanians originated from Presbyterians who had rejected the idea of state churches, and tried to go back to a New Testament type of Christianity. \n \n 8) Gregor Mendel (1822-1884)\n Mendel was the first to lay the mathematical foundations of genetics, in what came to be called \"Mendelianism\". He began his research in 1856 (three years before Darwin published his Origin of Species) in the garden of the Monastery in which he was a monk. Mendel was elected Abbot of his Monastery in 1868. His work remained comparatively unknown until the turn of the century, when a new generation of botanists began finding similar results and \"rediscovered\" him (though their ideas were not identical to his). An interesting point is that the 1860's was the formation of the X-Club, dedicated to lessening religious influences and propagating an image of \"conflict\" between science and religion. One sympathizer was Darwin's cousin Francis Galton, whose scientific interest was in genetics (a proponent of eugenics - selective breeding among humans to \"improve\" the stock). He was writing how the \"priestly mind\" was not conducive to science whilst, at around the same time, an Austrian monk was making the breakthrough in genetics. The rediscovery of the work of Mendel came too late to affect Galton's contribution. \n \n 9) Kelvin (William Thompson) (1824-1907)\n Kelvin was foremost among the small group of British scientists who helped to lay the foundations of modern physics. His work covered may areas of physics, and he was said to have more letters after his name than anyone else in the Commonwealth, since he received numerous honorary degrees from European Universities who recognized the value of his work. He was a very committed Christian, certainly more religious than the average for his era. Interestingly, his fellow physicists George Gabriel Stokes (1819-1903) and James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879) were also men of deep Christian commitment, in an era when many were nominal, apathetic, or anti-Christian. The Encyclopedia Britannica says \"Maxwell is regarded by most modern physicists as the scientist of the 19th century who had the greatest influence on 20th century physics; he is ranked with Sir Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein for the fundamental nature of his contributions.\" Lord Kelvin was an Old Earth creationist, who estimated the Earth's age to be somewhere between 20 million and 100 million years, with an upper limit at 500 million years based on cooling rates (a low estimate due to his lack of knowledge about radiogenic heating). \n \n 10) Max Planck (1858-1947)\n Planck made many contributions to physics, but is best known for quantum theory, which has revolutionized our understanding of the atomic and sub-atomic worlds.

Planck was a churchwarden from 1920 until his death, and believed in an almighty, all-knowing, beneficent God (though not necessarily a personal one).

   "Albert Einstein, for one, believed in God. But ya know, he's only the most noted physicist of all time. Perhaps you would feel better about your misconception were I to stop there. You could perhaps say that Einstein didn't really have a clue about the universe. Then I would offer you this list of chronological order including ten other of the most notable scientists in history. I honestly hope this ruins your day, but I doubt you're smart enough for that. This is copied and pasted from http://www.godandscience.org/apologetics/sciencefaith.html\n \n 1) Nicholas Copernicus (1473-1543)\n Copernicus was the Polish astronomer who put forward the first mathematically based system of planets going around the sun. He attended various European universities, and became a Canon in the Catholic church in 1497. His new system was actually first presented in the Vatican gardens in 1533 before Pope Clement VII who approved, and Copernicus was urged to publish around this time. Copernicus was never under any threat of religious persecution - and was urged to publish both by Catholic Bishop Guise, Cardinal Schonberg, and the Protestant Professor George Rheticus. Copernicus referred sometimes to God in his works, and did not see his system as in conflict with the Bible. \n \n 2) Johannes Kepler (1571-1630)\n Kepler was a brilliant mathematician and astronomer. He did early work on light, and established the laws of planetary motion about the sun. He also came close to reaching the Newtonian concept of universal gravity - well before Newton was born! His introduction of the idea of force in astronomy changed it radically in a modern direction. Kepler was an extremely sincere and pious Lutheran, whose works on astronomy contain writings about how space and the heavenly bodies represent the Trinity. Kepler suffered no persecution for his open avowal of the sun-centered system, and, indeed, was allowed as a Protestant to stay in Catholic Graz as a Professor (1595-1600) when other Protestants had been expelled! \n \n 3) Galileo Galilei (1564-1642)\n Galileo is often remembered for his conflict with the Roman Catholic Church. His controversial work on the solar system was published in 1633. It had no proofs of a sun-centered system (Galileo's telescope discoveries did not indicate a moving earth) and his one \"proof\" based upon the tides was invalid. It ignored the correct elliptical orbits of planets published twenty five years earlier by Kepler. Since his work finished by putting the Pope's favorite argument in the mouth of the simpleton in the dialogue, the Pope (an old friend of Galileo's) was very offended. After the \"trial\" and being forbidden to teach the sun-centered system, Galileo did his most useful theoretical work, which was on dynamics. Galileo expressly said that the Bible cannot err, he saw his system as concerning the issue of how the Bible should be interpreted. \n \n 4) Rene Descartes (1596-1650)\n Descartes was a French mathematician, scientist and philosopher who has been called the father of modern philosophy. His school studies made him dissatisfied with previous philosophy: He had a deep religious faith as a Catholic, which he retained to his dying day, along with a resolute, passionate desire to discover the truth. At the age of 24 he had a dream, and felt the vocational call to seek to bring knowledge together in one system of thought. His system began by asking what could be known if all else were doubted - suggesting the famous \"I think therefore I am\". Actually, it is often forgotten that the next step for Descartes was to establish the near certainty of the existence of God - for only if God both exists and would not want us to be deceived by our experiences can we trust our senses and logical thought processes. God is, therefore, central to his whole philosophy. What he really wanted was to see his philosophy adopted as standard Catholic teaching. Rene Descartes and Francis Bacon (1561-1626) are generally regarded as the key figures in the development of scientific methodology. Both had systems in which God was important, and both seem more devout than the average for their era. \n \n 5) Isaac Newton (1642-1727)\n In optics, mechanics, and mathematics, Newton was a figure of undisputed genius and innovation. In all his science (including chemistry) he saw mathematics and numbers as central. What is less well known is that he was devoutly religious and saw numbers as involved in understanding from the Bible God's plan for history. He did a lot of work on biblical numerology, and, though aspects of his beliefs were not orthodox, he thought theology very important. In his system of physics, God is essential to the nature and absoluteness of space. In Principia he stated, \"The most beautiful system of the sun, planets, and comets, could only proceed from the counsel and dominion on an intelligent and powerful Being.\" \n \n 6) Robert Boyle (1791-1867)\n One of the founders and key early members of the Royal Society, Boyle gave his name to \"Boyle's Law\" for gasses, and also wrote an important work on chemistry. The Encyclopedia Britannica says of him: \"By his will he endowed a series of Boyle lectures, or sermons, which still continue, \"for proving the Christian religion against notorious infidels.\"... As a devout Protestant, Boyle took a special interest in promoting the Christian religion abroad, giving money to translate and publish the New Testament into Irish and Turkish. In 1690 he developed his theological views in The Christian Virtuoso, which he wrote to show that the study of nature was a central religious duty.\" Boyle wrote against atheists in his day (the notion that atheism is a modern invention is a myth), and was clearly much more devoutly Christian than the average in his era. \n \n 7) Michael Faraday (1791-1867)\n The son of a blacksmith who became one of the greatest scientists of the 19th century. His work on electricity and magnetism not only revolutionized physics, but has led to so much in our lifestyles today which depend on them (including computers and telephone lines and so Web sites). Faraday was a devoutly Christian member of the Sandemanians, which significantly influenced upon him and strongly affected the way in which he approached and interpreted nature. The Sandemanians originated from Presbyterians who had rejected the idea of state churches, and tried to go back to a New Testament type of Christianity. \n \n 8) Gregor Mendel (1822-1884)\n Mendel was the first to lay the mathematical foundations of genetics, in what came to be called \"Mendelianism\". He began his research in 1856 (three years before Darwin published his Origin of Species) in the garden of the Monastery in which he was a monk. Mendel was elected Abbot of his Monastery in 1868. His work remained comparatively unknown until the turn of the century, when a new generation of botanists began finding similar results and \"rediscovered\" him (though their ideas were not identical to his). An interesting point is that the 1860's was the formation of the X-Club, dedicated to lessening religious influences and propagating an image of \"conflict\" between science and religion. One sympathizer was Darwin's cousin Francis Galton, whose scientific interest was in genetics (a proponent of eugenics - selective breeding among humans to \"improve\" the stock). He was writing how the \"priestly mind\" was not conducive to science whilst, at around the same time, an Austrian monk was making the breakthrough in genetics. The rediscovery of the work of Mendel came too late to affect Galton's contribution. \n \n 9) Kelvin (William Thompson) (1824-1907)\n Kelvin was foremost among the small group of British scientists who helped to lay the foundations of modern physics. His work covered may areas of physics, and he was said to have more letters after his name than anyone else in the Commonwealth, since he received numerous honorary degrees from European Universities who recognized the value of his work. He was a very committed Christian, certainly more religious than the average for his era. Interestingly, his fellow physicists George Gabriel Stokes (1819-1903) and James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879) were also men of deep Christian commitment, in an era when many were nominal, apathetic, or anti-Christian. The Encyclopedia Britannica says \"Maxwell is regarded by most modern physicists as the scientist of the 19th century who had the greatest influence on 20th century physics; he is ranked with Sir Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein for the fundamental nature of his contributions.\" Lord Kelvin was an Old Earth creationist, who estimated the Earth's age to be somewhere between 20 million and 100 million years, with an upper limit at 500 million years based on cooling rates (a low estimate due to his lack of knowledge about radiogenic heating). \n \n 10) Max Planck (1858-1947)\n Planck made many contributions to physics, but is best known for quantum theory, which has revolutionized our understanding of the atomic and sub-atomic worlds.

   "Attempted? . I have studied it for years , more than you have been alive I would guess.\n\n Well, then. That would put you well into your 80s in my case. \n \nOn the other hand I question your knowledge on the subject.\n\n Really. Isn't that strange. I haven't found anything that would make me question Clive's knowledge of the subject. I would question your knowledge though. For having studied the topic for so long (or so you claim), I would think that you wouldn't show such misunderstanding of basic concepts.\n \nNo one believes natural selection is the primary force for evolutionary change anymore.\n\n Did he say that? I missed it. Or maybe you misunderstood what was said. Of course natural selection isn't the primary force for evolutionary change. But the funny thing is that I don't recall that it ever was considered as such, at least not since the 1920s or before. Natural selection is a mechanism of evolutionary change, and a quite important one, but I would think that calling it a primary force is a bit overblown.\n \nRMNS , punctuated equilibrium.\n\n The space bar on your computer seems to be malfunctioning. You keep sticking extra spaces around punctuation. It is annoying.\n \n At any rate, I'm not sure what that little sentence fragment is supposed to mean. Are you implying that random mutation and natural selection together are the \"primary force\" or are you saying that punctuated equilibrium is? How does adding another mechanism (in the case of mutation) make it a \"force.\" Yes, mutation and natural selection are two of the mechanisms of evolution. But, no, punctuated equilibrium is not. Perhaps if you explained what you think punctuated equilibrium is and why you think that it is a \"primary force.\"\n \nIf there are any experianced evolutionist here they should be correcting you.\n\n Well, I went back and looked and I don't find anything in need of correcting. Oh, wait. I guess I should say that the statement, \"Natural selection is the most likely mechanism for explaining how evolution occurs\" should be corrected to add, \"natural selection, in conjunction with other mechanisms...\". Happy now?\n \nThe statement there is no difference in micro and macro evolution is absurd.\n\n Not really. The difference is one of degree. I know of several examples of macro-evolution that are demonstrably nothing more than the accumulation of micro-evolution. I have found that biologists don't use the terms all that much anymore. They were first coined during the days of debate over a now discredited hypothesis about how evolution happens. Mostly I hear the terms used by creationists who confuse the meanings.\n \n By the way,\n \nDarwins theory was based on the extapolation of this ideas he borrowed without acknowledgement from Blyth and at least one other.\n\n What does \"extapolation\" mean? I've never heard the word. Perhaps you meand \"extrapolation,\" but that wouldn't make any sense. Darwin did state that he had read Malthus (funny how you characterize that as \"one other\") and got some of the initial ideas there. Of course, Wallace did too. And Blyth took many ideas from Lamarck, which were rejected by Darwin. And it seems funny that Blyth doesn't seem to have been aware that Darwin had \"borrowed\" his ideas, and even subsequently wrote about the \"Origen of Species.\n \nIf you want to argue Haldane's Dilema go talk to Walter Dembreski over at Baylor. He enjoys that arguement.\n\n No one mentioned Haldane's dilema. What was asked was that you explain, in your own words, the difference between Hamilton's and Haldane's equations for kin selection. What does that have to do with Haldane's dilema? By the way, the guy that you are probably referring to at Baylor is William Dembski. And Dembski's math on Haldane's dilema has been shown to be based on false assumptions.\n \n Oh, yeah. Don't forget to answer Beowulf's question. I am most interested in seeing your answer.",

At what university did you say you studied it?\n \n I did not say . I said I have studied it. Where did you study reading comprehension -pre-school? I read a lot. This would not help you as your reading comprehension skills are non-existant. You must be told what to think as it is obvious you do not know how to. \n\n \n And yet you cited Gould and don't even know that he wasn't talking about punctuated equilibrium. Obviously you don't know what Gould was discussing.\n \n No. It wasn't. Isn't it a shame that you claim to have studied evolutionary theory and you don't know what the theory of punctuated equilibrium is.\n \n What book are you talking about? Specifically what book do you have in mind?\n \n In regard to your Gould quote, since you have read his \"book\", I am sure that you are familiar with his comments on the use of his statement as you have done.\n \n Notice that the quote I give has a copyright in 1983. It actually appeared in print in 1981. Your quote appeared in print in 1977. Just think. You are hitching your wagon to comments that Gould made more than 28 years ago.\n \n \n Was he wrong then-was his intelligence still evolving? Did IT give him a vision 4 years later? You need to explain what he meant about there being almost no evidence for gradualism in the fossils. He felt the same way about geology , it does not show gradualism either.\n \n Gould wrote: \n \n 'Charles Lyell was a lawyer by profession, and his book is one of the most brilliant briefs published by an advocate. ... Lyell relied upon true bits of cunning to establish his uniformitarian views as the only true geology. First, he set up a straw man to demolish. In fact, the catastrophists were much more empirically minded than Lyell. The geologic record does seem to require catastrophes: rocks are fractured and contorted; whole faunas are wiped out. To circumvent this literal appearance, Lyell imposed his imagination upon the evidence. The geologic record, he argued, is extremely imperfect and we must interpolate into it what we can reasonably infer but cannot see. The catastrophists were the hard-nosed empiricists of their day, not the blinded theological apologists. \n\n \n \n \n So what book by Gould are you talking about? When you cite an author it is customary to tell where you got the quote.\n\n \n \"The extreme rarity of transitional forms in the fossil record persists as a trade secret of Paleontology. Evolutionary trees that adorn our textbooks have data only at the tips and nodes of their branches; the rest is inference, however reasonable, not the evidence of fossils.\" \n \n (Dr. Stephan J Gould, Harvard Paleontologist, \"Evolution, Erratic Pace\")",

   "You keep making these statements that I said Punctuated absurdity replaced Natural Selection. If you want to discuss this fine if you want to make up what I said that is not fine. The hopeful monster theory was introduced to explain the extreme rarity of so called transistional fossils.\n\n What utter ignorance. You keep making a fool of yourself. You keep mixing references to the hopeful monster theory and punctuated equilibrium. They are not the same. The fact that Gould wrote a single essay about something that you think was the hopeful monster theory does not make it punctuated equilibrium. At least have the integrity to learn what you are talking about. The essay you are so fond of is NOT about punctuated equilibrium. It is merely one of many, many essays that Gould wrote about a variety of subjects, even baseball.",
