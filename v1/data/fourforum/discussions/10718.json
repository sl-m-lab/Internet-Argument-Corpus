   "a pattern of firing neurones can not be 'read'.\n\n \n Not yet, but i wouldn't bet the bank we can't figure it out. We just haven't deciphered the code, or really know what the code must look like. In neuroscience, they are at the same stage genetics used to be before DNA was figured out. Mind is probably going to be a harder problem to crack than genes.\n \n \n where is the correlation of : \"I am awake\" in a pattern of firing neurones? brain generate mind, but mind is not brain.\n\n \n Mind is a functioning brain, in my view. What else is there?\n \n \ncan you read any thoughts from electrical impulses? thoughts and electrical impulses are not the same. The duality mind-brain still persists. No matter what you do, you always end up at square one: mind is not brain, thoughts are not electrical impulses. all those electrical impulses tell you is the presence of brain activity not of the presence of mind.\n\n \n Well here's the thing, I reject mind-brain duality. Without electrical activity in the brain, a person cannot have a mind at all -- brain electrical activity generates the mind in some unknown way. Mind-brain are just different ways of looking at the same phenomenon, the generation of consciousness by a material system such as a brain. Mind exists where neuronal activity exists in particular patterns. It's the job of neuroscience to figure out what those are.",

   "*Employee Gift* \n \n A new pastor, eager to make sure the church's employees would like him, called them together shortly before Christmas Day and told them that each of them would receive a turkey. \n \n \"In fact,\" he added, \"as long as I'm around, you will always have a turkey.\" \n \n *Thanks to Pastor Tim for this joke!* \n http://www.cybersalt.org/cleanlaugh \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n The longer you study GOD'S WORD the better your chances of UNDERSTANDING HIM. DON'T assume your FIRST IMPRESSION is the one HE meant. You just might be jumping to conclusions like the employees in the JOKE ABOVE who assume their new pastor meant he was a TURKEY and he'd always be around. So they'd always have a TURKEY.\n \n I BELIEVE GOD uses language that can be MISUNDERSTOOD on purpoe to test us and make us SEEK the TRUTH (to test our faith). If we AREN'T willling to put in the time to get to know the TRUTH we WON'T find it. \n \n SEEK AND YOU SHALL FIND IT.\n\n \n GOD actually gave a very similar message to Isaiah (see Isaiah 6:8-10 below). Christ also said had a similar message about those who had eyes but could not see; those who had ears but could not hear ... So GOD does keep secrets. HE uses them to give us a chance to PROVE our faith on that last JUDGEMENT DAY. On that Last JUDGEMENT DAY, your ANSWERS to GOD'S questions will tell HIM how hard you worked at your faith. \n \n Will your answers tell HIM you found ALL the IMPORTANT HIDDEN MESSAGES? Will they tell HIM you obey ALL HIS LAWS? \n \n Your answers to the questions HE asks you will EXPOSE the TURTH. Just like Adam and Eve's answers to HIS QUESTIONS EXPOSED them when GOD judged them in the garden. \n \n Now you KNOW more about your LAST JUDGEMENT. Start studying GOD'S WORD and start PREPARING for the MOST IMPORTANT TEST you'll ever take.\n \n ISAIAH 6:8-10 \n \n 9 He said, \"Go and tell this people: \"'Be ever hearing, but never understanding; be ever seeing, but never perceiving.' 10 Make the heart of this people calloused; make their ears dull and close their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn and be healed.\"",

   "\n We have to TRUST GOD like a LITTLE CHILD \n \n\n \n\n Why would a reasoning adult agree to this relationship?\n \n\n \n If you have a child of your own you know you have to bring your conversations down to their level for them to understand. GOD has to do the SAMETHING for us.\n \n For example: Florida's primary was today. Since our local library is one of the polling places the doors to the lobby were open at 7AM but the library DIDN'T open till 12PM. Try and convience a toddler that the libray ISN'T open when the automatic doors open automattically for them. They CAN'T understand time or the library hour sign because they DON'T understand those concepts yet. They AREN'T that mature yet.\n \n Compared to GOD we are that TODDLER. Some of us are a little older and a little more mature but NONE of us are as mature as Christ was when he doing GOD'S WORK. What I'm saying is that GOD could and did talk to Christ and all of HIS prophets on a DIFFERENT LEVEL because they were/are older and more SPIRITUALLY MATURE than us. That may explain why the bible is HARDER for some of us to understand than others. Some of us are more SPIRITUALLY MATURE than others but NOT as SPIRITUALLY MATURE as GOD'S prophets. So some of us get a DEEPER UNDERSTANDING of GOD'S MESSAGES than others. \n \n Your level of SPIRITUAL MATURITY will depend on how much time you spend reading and studying GOD'S WORD. Have you read from the GOOD BOOK lately? If NOT tonight would be a GREAT TIME to start.\n \n Just like most TODDLERS that attend PRESCHOOL are better students than those that don't. People that spend more time reading and studying the bible are USUALLY more SPIRITUALLY MATURE. So how IMPORTANT is your LEVEL of SPIRITUAL MATURITY to you? Is it IMPORTANT enough to convince you to hit the book tonight. I sure hope so.\n \n GOD BLESS",
