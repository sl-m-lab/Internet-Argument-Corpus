   "Because the United States no longer has a draft to ensure new recruits for the military, it has been necessary to recycle our current troops endlessly through pressuring them to re-enlist or by extending their combat tour of duties well beyond what is in their contracts, or by cutting short their leaves in the states and forcing them to redeploy to the battlefield.\n \n Some of our military personnel have been redeployed to the war zones in Iraq three or four times because there are no new troops or recruits in any number being readied for combat duty.\n \n Our national guard, which is not to be deployed into foreign war zones under normal circumstances, has been worn to pieces, their equipment is falling apart because it has not been adequately maintained by Rumsfeld's defense department.\n \n That is one of the reasons why New Orleans was abandoned a year or so ago when Hurricane Katrina hit the US Gulf Coast. Much of the Louisiana National Guard, as well as much of its equipment, had been deployed to the war zones of Iraq and was unable to serve in that national emergency.",

There is already movement afoot to completely change out all the nutballs in congress.\n Huck\n\n \n I don't think that anybody is arguing that they should refuse funding for troops that are already in theater. They are talking about refusing funding to deploy new troops unless those troops have been properly equipped and trained. It is a brilliant moves by the democrats to turn the neo cons idiotic, neo fascist \"support the troops\" propaganda campaign against them. The talking heads and XXXXXX out there will have a hard time arguing that they support the troops while at the same time decrying a bill that takes steps to ensure that every soldier in combat has proper training and gear. \n \n I am sure the \"movement afoot\" to change out the \"nutballs\" in congress has them shaking in their boots, especially considering the fact that a WIDE majority of Americans supports action by congress to either remove troops immeditaly or to begin removing them by the end of the year. Even if there WAS a realistic plan to completely sweep congress clean, it would take 6 years to do it, and then you would just have a bunch of freshmen nutballs running around. Your average American has an attention span of about 30 seconds and the intelligence of a goat. Good luck getting them to stay focuses for 6 years to sweep the garbage out of congress. \n \n At this point, with the numbers for the war where they are, the repubs are playing a VERY dangerous game by even uttering the words \"support\" and \"troops\" in the same sentence. At this point it is pretty clear to most americans that we were lied to in order to get us into this war, and the republican led congress helped cover that fact to keep us in the war. \n \n It took a few more years for them to figure it out than it should have, but the american people have finally caught onto the fact that if you send off soldiers to be horribly killed and maimed in an illegal war based on cooked up intelligence and lies, that is not only not in the best interests of the US, but ultimatly is directly opposed to our interests, you look pretty stupid saying things about supporting the troops.",

Once again, they've demonstrated their ineptitude to bring real change by getting bogged down on whatever-is-most-obstructionistic-toward-Bush. They need to get back on track and work toward an end to the whole damn war.\n\n \n I can agree that they should be working on ending the whole war, and frankly I think that they should cut war funding. Not to do so in light of the overwhelming number of Americans that want us out of Iraq shows a distinct lack of loyalty to the americans who voted them into office. While I am sure the Bush adminsitration would try to pull their standard \"support the troops\" BS, the American people are not quite THAT stupid...I think that the folks in congress can explain in 30 second soundbites that they are supporting the troops by givign them what they want above all....a plane ticket home.\n \n If Bush chooses to keep the troop in country without any funding, that is HIS choice and I don't think that the republicans will let him do it. They want a shot at winning some elections in the next decade, and if Bush goes against the will of the american people and keeps them there with no money, the republicans can kiss any hopes they have of running washington goodbye for at least the next decade.\n \n Ultimatly what the dems are doing is a covert troop reduction. There is a limit to how long they can extend troop deployments, and if there are no replacement troops to be had, and the currently deployed troops have to be rotated out, you simply have fewer troops in country. \n \n Ultimatly, I have troubel getting worked up over this any more. The american public made its bed, now it is time to sleep in it. I don't particularly care if Americans soldiers die. That is just part of their job. They deserve roughly the same sympathy that the guy at Mc Donalds gets for having to clean out a disgusting grease trap. It is what they signed up for. I would rather the soldiers didn't have to die, just like if I had a magic wand so the kid at McDonalds didn't have to clean out grease traps I would use it, but I don't really give any special consideration to the lives of soldiers. In fact, if anything, I think that the lives of soldiers are FAR, FAR less valuable than the lives of civilians, regardless of nationality, and that if you can trade 100 solders lives for the life of a single civilian, you should do it without second thought.\n \n So, since I care not at all for the lives of US soldiers, the 2 remaining reasons for staying are concern for the Iraqi people and the fiscal costs. The Iraqi people are screwed either way. We already ###### away any chance we may have had to save any iraqi lives. We leave, they fight their civil war, and then they go on. OR, we can stay, they fight a LONGER civil war, and go on. \n \n Ultimatly, when it comes to the last concern which is the fiscal concern, there is not that much difference at this point. When bush came into office, I had some high hopes, as did most of the internation banking community, that he was going to cut spending and get our house in order...make the tough decisions that needed to be made in order to save our economy from itself and avoid massive dollar devaluation. Didn't happen. Instead, he encouraged a multi trillion dollar equity bubble and went on a spending spree. When greenspan retired, he gave helicopter Ben the job. Every central bank on the planet that has made public statements regarding their dollar reserve status has said they are working on diversifying reserves away from the dollar. OPEC nations, even ou strongest supporter there, saudi arabia, are accepting oil payments in Euros and many are talking about demanding them in Euros (including the sauds) since the EU has opted to continue to pay for their oil in dollars as a means of dumping their dollar problem off on somebody else. \n \n At this point, the financial chips are going to fall where they may. A few hundred billion dollars one way or the other is not going to matter. If Bush had carried out some responsible fiscal policies to begin with, some damage may have been mitigated. Now it is too late.",
