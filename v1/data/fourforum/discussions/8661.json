   "http://www.outofcontext.us/ \nA gay professor in New Testament at a conservative bible college in East Tennessee publicly announced his departure from the college, citing the college's attitude towards gay people as one of his reasons for leaving.\n \n A professor teaching New Testament studies at Johnson Bible College in Knoxville, Tennessee, who resigned his position as of June 30, publicly announced today that he was gay, in an effort to draw attention to the church's prejudice against homosexuals.\n \n John Rumple, a graduate of Johnson Bible College, served as a professor there for three years (2003--2006) while withholding his sexual orientation from the college administration. Homosexuals are not permitted to serve on the faculty or staff, or even study at Johnson Bible College, which is part of the Stone--Campbell movement of churches, allied with the \"Christian Church\" and fundamentalist \"Church of Christ.\"\n \n In a letter issued today to the president, trustees, faculty, staff, and students of the college, John Rumple said, \"It is critical that the church starts paying attention to what the Holy Spirit is doing in the lives of gay people. . . . I can only hope that my ministry here during these past three years causes some to seriously reconsider what the church assumes to be true of gay people.\"\n \n Citing ignorance and prejudice on the issue of homosexuality, Mr. Rumple said that, \"The church has it wrong about gay people,\" and that its \"facile\" view of homosexuals was due to \"a serious lack of interest in scholarly investigation of the Bible,\" something he hopes to combat by coming out.\n \n John Rumple, who is in his final year of study for a PhD in New Testament at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, has lived with his male partner of five years while serving at Johnson Bible College, in an attempt to remain true to both his church calling and his identity as a gay man. He did not tell the college's administration the truth about his sexual orientation while a professor there, since he would have been instantly dismissed.\n \n Contrasting the approach of these churches with that of Jesus Christ, John Rumple stated that, \"This double-bind---of being dishonest and permitted to serve, or honest and disqualified---is a situation into which Jesus would never place a disciple.\"\n \n In an effort to fight what he calls \"the faulty interpretation of those biblical texts which supposedly condemn all gay people for all time,\" John Rumple has initiated a website, www.outofcontext.us, with the goal of providing spiritual support for gay Christians, and to help all Christians overcome their homophobia.\n",

   "http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601088&sid=aGCRq.DQOAqE&refer=home \nAug. 9 (Bloomberg) -- ``I write as a jilted lover,'' begins a provocative new book about politics and religion by Randall Balmer, an evangelical Christian and professor of American religious history at Barnard College in New York. \n \n In ``Thy Kingdom Come: How the Religious Right Distorts the Faith and Threatens America,'' Balmer, 51, argues that evangelicals have strayed from the teachings of Jesus Christ and their own historical support of progressive causes by aligning themselves so completely with the Republican party. \n \n Balmer, 51, worked on Capitol Hill as a research intern in 1975 for John B. Anderson, who then headed the House Republican Conference. In the 1980 presidential election, Balmer voted for Anderson, who lost the Republican primary and ran for president as an independent. That's the closest Balmer has ever come to voting Republican. \n \n Schatz: Why do you feel betrayed by the religious right? \n \n Balmer: I think the religious right has led evangelical Christians astray on two counts. They've taken the New Testament, which as a believer I take very seriously -- and they've turned something I would consider lovely and redemptive into something else that is ugly and punitive. They've gone through the scriptures and cherry-picked certain passages and used those passages as a bludgeon against their political enemies. \n",
