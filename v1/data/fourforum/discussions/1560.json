   "One post had begun \"When do I become a Christian?\". It got me thinking - Adolf Hitler was baptised a Catholic. Was he really a Christian, as many people here seem to think?\n *\n When the Reich Minister for Church Affairs,* Hanns Karrl died in 1941 Hitler said \"Karrl, with the noblest intentions, wanted to attempt a synthesis between National Socialism and Christianity. I do not believe this is possible, and I see the obstacle is Christianity itself... Pure Christianity - the Christianity of the catacombs - is concerned with translating the Christian doctrine into fact. It leads simply to the annihilation of mankind. It is merely wholehearted Bolshevism, under the tinsel of metaphysics\".\n quoted in \"Christianity on Trial: Arguments against anti-religious bigotry\", Carroll, V, and Shiflett, D, p115.\n \n Hardly sounds like he thought that he was.\n *\n Leading Nazi, Alfred Rosenberg wrote \"The Myth of the Twentieth Century\", in which he said \"The Christian-Jewish plague must perish\".\n *\n One of the acts of the Nazi party was to abolish the Catholic German Centre Party.",

   "That's mythical propaganda - Hitler didn't believe in God. People sometimes get the idea that he was since he quoted the Bible once or twice. He was baptized Catholic but (as far as I know) he spent his whole political career as a devout non-Christian. Check these two links:\n http://kevin.davnet.org/essays/hitler.html\n http://answers.org/apologetics/hitquote.html\n \n Plus, even if he did claim to be Christian (which he didn't) he still wouldn't have been a Christian.",

   "Hitler's was less of a Catholic than Ted Kennedy- that's for sure.\n \n Although Hitler was baptized in the faith, and his mother was extremely devout. However, Hitler lost his faith because so many horrible things happened in his life- his father died, he was rejected from the Vienna Art Institute, and then his mother died- the list went on and on. His beliefs were more paganistic, as Pius XII called him in the 1930's.\n \n Hitler certainly did claim to be a CHristian, but that was merely for publicity. Many politicians today call themselves Christians or whatever, but are they really? No. How else was Hitler going to be the leader of a nation that was 90% Christian?",

   " \"I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator: by defending myself against the Jew, I am fighting for the work of the Lord..\"\n \n \"My feelings as a Christian points me to my Lord and Savior as a fighter. It points me to the man who once in loneliness, surrounded by a few followers, recognized these Jews for what they were and summoned men to fight against them and who, God's truth! was greatest not as a sufferer but as a fighter. In boundless love as a Christian and as a man I read through the passage which tells us how the Lord at last rose in His might and seized the scourge to drive out of the Temple the brood of vipers and adders. How terrific was His fight for the world against the Jewish poison. To-day, after two thousand years, with deepest emotion I recognize more profoundly than ever before the fact that it was for this that He had to shed His blood upon the Cross. As a Christian I have no duty to allow myself to be cheated, but I have the duty to be a fighter for truth and justice... And if there is anything which could demonstrate that we are acting rightly it is the distress that daily grows. For as a Christian I have also a duty to my own people.\n \n \n \n \"I am now as before a Catholic and will always remain so,\"\n \n However, all these speeches were public. Clinton and Gore both claim to be baptist. Do they go to sunday services? Hardly ever. THere's also some confusion about Pius XII. Man XXXXXX are claiming that he supported the Nazi movement, which is absolutely incorrect.",
