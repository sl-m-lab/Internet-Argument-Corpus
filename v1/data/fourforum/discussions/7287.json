   "Last week I was hanging out at a local car lot specializing in classics discussing cars, restoration, prices and the usual loafer dialog with three other people and the owner. As usual the conversation got around to primo pieces, what they were bringing at auction and the upcoming Barrett-Jackson Auction. The lot owner asked one of the other men if he had ever considered selling his Cord and immediate silence ensued.\n \n We all ended up going to the Cord owners home and there it was, the first perfect Cord Convertible I've ever seen outside a museum. Just sitting in one of his garages, ready to roll. It's one of a total of 21 Cords, all body styles, that were exported from the US. This one has been restored to perfect (the owner judges at fine classic car shows and says its about 98-points but will be 100 when he's done), red with a white top and black interior. He purchased it several years ago in India and brought it back for the restoration, a three-year project. He has a small collection, about 25 fine pieces including Pierce Arrow through 1930s Packard sedans and others with two full-time mechanics capable of fabrication, but the Cord is the centerpiece of his collection. The level of detail and workmanship astounded me. Sitting in it was a great thrill.",

   "I can imagine the thrill. When I was about 12, I took a short ride in a Duesenberg.\n\n \n When I was 16, I had a summer job working for a plumbing supply store. Every couple of days, we would drive to a nearby stockyard to get a load of 4\" cast iron sewer pipe. One day, my boss, the owner of the store, brought me to the business next to the stockyard. It was a classic car restoration garage. I thought that I had died and gone to Heaven. I was especially impressed with the V16 Cadillac with deerskin and wood interior. emoticon_xgood",
