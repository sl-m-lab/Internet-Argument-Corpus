The Old Testament, originally written in Hebrew, had been translated into Greek around the third century B.C. because Greek was the more common language spoken. In Jesus' day the Old Testament was referred to as the Law, the Prophets, and the Writings (or more commonly just the Law and the Prophets). This designation referred to the same books that are in our Old Testament today.\n \n Jesus repeatedly validated the Old Testament as a whole: \"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them\" (Matthew 5:17) He even seemed to indicate the beginning and end points of the Old Testament by referring to an event in Genesis and then another in 2 Chronicles (Matthew 23:35) - the first and last books according to the Hebrew order. He considered these \"bookends\" of divine Jewish revelation.\n \n The New Testament books were all written before the end of the first century and were widely circulated as individual books for several centuries. The first list of all the New Testament books together as we find them in our Bibles today was written in A.D. 367 by Athanasius. Other partial lists existed before then, but his list and the councils of Hippo (A.D. 393) and Carthage (A.D. 397 and 419) formalized the New Testament as it came down to us today. \n\n \n That's good enough for me.

When I go to my class, my teacher doesn't throw Evolution in my face nor does she say that God placed these bones on earth... it is simply something that is fact. Fact: The thing is a bone, it is old, it is not of a species we still have (Nothing that calls out her own beliefs). Anyway... she's Jewish I believe. NOT all scientists are atheist.",

Even from a religious point of view, many may think of us as \"children of God\", but most such \"children\" are more like teenagers that need to know the reason behind a law imposed by their parent before they will willingly follow it.\n \n \nScientific / intellectual? The terms are almost identical? Do you think there is any other subject that comes close to rivaling science for knowledge, concerning ID vs. naturalistic evolution?\n\n Though I realize that this thread is within a thread of ID vs Evolution, I have not memorized enough facts about Evolution to put up a sufficiently good arguement - many others are doing that perfectly well. As for whether intellectual = scientific, I would say that one can base one's world view on religion and still be intellectual and engage in rational debate. The main difference lies in the assumptions one makes in defining that world view. As a scientist, my approach is to always follow the evidence. As a private person, I would still like to hold onto some religious beliefs, but these have to fit within the unexplained areas of Science (of which there are still enough to leave some room for religion). I simply cannot see how people can openly put on blinders to ignore scientific findings.",
