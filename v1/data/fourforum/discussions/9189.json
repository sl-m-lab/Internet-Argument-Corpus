   "Any Republicans out there? Why not take this advice?\n http://jonswift.blogspot.com/2006/11/save-britneys-marriage.html\n \n \nOrdinarily, the break-up of one marriage wouldn't be something that Congress would concern itself with. But last spring when the Federal government intervened to prevent Terry Schiavo's feeding tube from being removed, Republicans reversed centuries of aloofness from the day-to-day concerns of Americans' lives to show they really cared about all of us. In a desperate attempt to save her life, the House and Senate passed a bill transferring jurisdiction over Schiavo's case to Federal courts and President Bush rushed back to Washington from Texas to sign it. Ultimately their efforts failed, and this failure may have sparked doubts in the minds of many Americans about Republican leadership. Though it won't bring Terry back, saving Britney's marriage would give Republicans one last chance to redeem themselves in the eyes of the American people.\n\n \n \n Or is the hypocrsy to much?",

   "Bill Frist ended his potential presidential campaign the moment he supported the involvement of the Federal Gov't into the private dispute of that family.\n \n What amuses and disturbs me is that Republicans would rather focus on denying gays marriage in the argument that it hurts the sanctity of marriage yet do essentially nothing as the divorce rate steadily climbs to 60%. But then again, there's a very good possibility that they don't actually care about marriage in general, they just need the votes.",
