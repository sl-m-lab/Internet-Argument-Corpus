In the mean time, they are going for what they can get. If you were to ask me, fart jokes loose their humor at age 2. I remember going to see a movie called Master Of Disguise, mainly because Brent Spiner played the villain. I prefer him as Data on Star Trek TNG, but he was the villain in this movie. In the end, the day was saved because he farted too much. Why? I don't get fart jokes. It's funny like once at most. After that, it's not funny anymore. Out of curiosity, why do people (kids or whoever) find a fart funny? Am I missing something when it comes to farts? Wait, were your friends drunk at the time?",
