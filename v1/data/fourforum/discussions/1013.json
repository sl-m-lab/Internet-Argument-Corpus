Then they compiled the Bible.\n BUT that wasn't ever the only book consulted by our Church.\n There are numerous other Gospels, such as that of Clement of Rome and Ignatius of Antioch, written by two people who were taught by Peter. Then they too taught others, and those students also wrote.

It is sitting on top of a mountain and watching an eagle soar. it is fly fishing in a quite mountain stream. these beliefs may seem foreign to you, but nature speaks to me in ways that Christianity never did.\n\n \n Oddly enough I accept your religious experiences as genuine religious experiences. To a degree anyone can believe whatever they like; the degree ends on judgment day, when we are all called to account. Ultimately it will be you and God, not you, me, and God. Or, you, your friends and God. You won't be able to turn to a solicitor to bail you out on a technicality.\n \n However, I don't think that the real source of your experience emanates from an object.\n \n I believe in God, but I also recognise Satan exists. Anything that isn't 'from' God, must ipso facto be 'from' Satan.\n \n My belief of God contains certain revealed truths. Likewise, your beliefs may either actively oppose them, or make them relativist truths; that is, you'll accept them as far as I'm concerned, but no further. The first act is one reason why the Church is against pagans, Wicca etc. (see above re: anything that isn't 'from' God). The second belief, that of relativism is less harmful, insofar as you're not opposing the Church actively, but it is harmful to yourself and your relationship with God, because you're denying the fullness and universality of His message.\n \n Satan is an active agent to cause confusion. One of the things he supports is raising man up to challenge God; as he once did himself. One of the ways he does this is by confusing people as to the possibility of a truth. \"Think for yourself\" he'd cheer, \"You're just as smart as anyone else, apply God's laws only where you see fit\".\n \n \"Don't believe in 'sin'\" would be another mantra.\n \n Thus belief systems that set man so high, I actively discourage.\n \n Buddhism is itself a peaceful enough religion. However it's basic tenet is man is perfectible by his own efforts.\n Hinduism too seeks to do this.\n Calvinism says that there's nothing man can do to get to heaven; this is the other extreme. We Orthodox hold that faith and works together are necessary... with God probably giving marks for trying. I think actively denying God though, and worshipping a source of power that is not Him is not a very good way, but ultimately, as I say, it's up to God. He's told us to have no other gods besides Him... so I think that's a bit of a clue.\n \n \n On another note...\n I know it doesn't sit well with modern pluralist societies that someone such as myself can call someone else evil. I also understand the passage of 'judge ye not' however I would also be denying God's message should I say anything less than the truth (as I see it). It would be dishonest of me; though I don't hide behind a veil of honest dignity; one of my main flaws is intellectual arrogance, and I like to argue.\n \n The thing you must also distinguish is that why'll I'll angrily disagree with you and your beliefs, I will not be the first to raise my hand against you. IF hypothetically I saw Orthodox people beating up a pagan, I would not hesitate to come to that pagan's aid. This is because part of my beliefs is that you are gifted with a soul and are special in the eyes of the Lord.\n \n I can be no other way and remain true to my beliefs.",

Besides, I think that if a person is truly saved, he will be less inclined to murder, or any sin for that matter. Remember point five, perserverance of the saints.\n\n \n Sorry for missing this post. Most of the Christian posters on this forum will no doubt disagree with this.\n \n Yes, I believe that life is a struggle. I think that saying \"I am saved\" is too easy.\n \n What happens to a born-again Christian who later in life converts to say, Catholicism. Does he become 'un-saved'?\n \n So, yes... if I commit a sin I am going against God's will. It makes no sense to me that God would say \"Ok, lads, I'll take you in no matter what you do, just so long as you say the magice word(s)\".\n \n Part of my reasoning for this is my form of logic as stated earlier, plus right from day 1 the Church as founded by Jesus has developed this doctrine.\n \n Martin Luther comes about 1,500 years after the fact, and says \"Sorry fellas, you've got it all wrong all this time\", and \"Sure, you've been teaching this doctrine all this time, but if I re-read the Bible my own way it says what I want it to say\"\n \n And Luther was known for his active and liberal way he translated the Bible into German, re-wording phrases to emphasise his point - he thought that this was fair, because he believed that's what the Bible was trying to say.\n \n There is no doubt that works alone (that is deeds) will get you into heaven, but neither will faith alone (sola fide). Orthodox and Catholics believe it is by God's grace, but it is not a hollow magical spell you say that gets this.\n \n Calvin himself came up with the ultimate anti-works thesis, that of pre-destination. It doesn't matter one iota what you do in life, you're going to end up in heaven or hell, on the whim of God.\n \n Luther worked on some of the writings of Augustine.. there may be some writings of Origen as well, but 99% of writers in the Orthodox faith have taught the one way, and Luther comes along and turns this all upsided down.\n \n Luther as an individual had the right to interpret the Bible for himself, but he went to the height of arrogance to believe that he knew better than Holy Traidition. He went against the Church that put the Bible together. Further he then decided how to read it.\n \n Imagine if you will, that you wrote a book. You had in mind certain ideas. Then someone comes along and says that you wrote it for a purpose totally different from what you intended. Even if you speak up, this person uses chapters in your book out of the context you put them in. Luther did the same. Calvin continued Luther's errors.\n \n If you want to know about context, you can for instance find a copy of the Didache; this book was written somewhere between the years 50 and 120. Thus this is a very very early Christian book, and predates the compiling of the Bible. In it it talks about partaking in the Eucharist* - that is, the Communion of Jesus' Body and Blood. Many Protestants read the Bible and suggest that Jesus' commandment \"do this in memory of Me\" can be read symbolically. Yes, as it stands you can read it like that - but the Didache, a manual for Christians re-inforces the Orthdox position. Tradition says that it is the actual Body of Christ.\n \n So Luther had no right to set up his own beliefs, but he did.Once Luther broke away, he himself then tried to set up a dogma to prevent further breaches. The very dogmitic approach of Catholicism he repeated, in his own fashion and he equally condemned anyone who didn't follow his preachings. He notoriously urged the suppression of Anabaptists (and he also didn't like the Jews)\n \n But even in his generation the church was fracturing into groups lead by Calvin, Zwingli, the king of England, the Anabaptists etc. And this fracturing of the Church continues to this day. Each one of these in turn tried to form their own dogma. Calvin set up a theistic state in which anyone who went against his civil government was guilty of heresy and punished.\n \n If you look to the New Testament, St. Paul was always preaching Church unity. St. Paul never said \"Ok guys, you now believe in Christ, go an worship the way you want to\"\n \n Most Protestants attempt to get around this when they talk of an 'invisible church' that they are all memebers of - that this church doesn't exist here on earth, but in heaven. Therefore it doesn't matter if one Protestant church has their service in one form, and another Protestant church does it another way\n \n This is a nonsense, because St. Paul was continually urging Christians to NOT practice their own way; and to obey the Bishops etc. Early writers such as St. Clement of Rome (his Epistle dates 80-140), and St. Ignatius of Antioch (dating c.105-115) both new St. Peter and were taught directly by him.\n Both these writers continued in writing in the same way - obey bishops, unity of faith etc. They ellaborated on what St. Paul wrote, not contradict it.\n \n Luther, Calvin etc contradicted these teachings.\n \n \n \n *It is called the Eucharist in the Didache - that is, the Body of Christ.",

Besides the ones saying the \"magic words\" are the people saying the same Hail Mary over and over again in a vain attempt to pay for a sin that is already paid for. \n \n \n\n Part of my reasoning for this is my form of logic as stated earlier, plus right from day 1 the Church as founded by Jesus has developed this doctrine.\n \n Martin Luther comes about 1,500 years after the fact, and says \"Sorry fellas, you've got it all wrong all this time\", and \"Sure, you've been teaching this doctrine all this time, but if I re-read the Bible my own way it says what I want it to say\"\nNope, the church were the ones that were going against scripture, and they wouldn't let anyone else have a translation of the Bible because they KNEW that people would figure out their XXXX. They were teaching that they could pay money and have their sins forgiven instead of just simply asking for it. \n \n \nAnd Luther was known for his active and liberal way he translated the Bible into German, re-wording phrases to emphasise his point - he thought that this was fair, because he believed that's what the Bible was trying to say.\n \n There is no doubt that works alone (that is deeds) will [not] get you into heaven, but neither will faith alone (sola fide). Orthodox and Catholics believe it is by God's grace, but it is not a hollow magical spell you say that gets this.\n What about \"we are saved by grace, through faith, not by works...\"? Also real and true saving faith will be accompanied by works. How exactly did Luther twist the scriptures? \n \n\n Calvin himself came up with the ultimate anti-works thesis, that of pre-destination. It doesn't matter one iota what you do in life, you're going to end up in heaven or hell, on the whim of God.\nQuite interesting that you trivialize God's will and put the will of man over it.\n \n \nLuther worked on some of the writings of Augustine.. there may be some writings of Origen as well, but 99% of writers in the Orthodox faith have taught the one way, and Luther comes along and turns this all upsided down.\n \n Luther as an individual had the right to interpret the Bible for himself, but he went to the height of arrogance to believe that he knew better than Holy Traidition. He went against the Church that put the Bible together. Further he then decided how to read it.\nHa, holy tradition. Why even read the Bible when you can stick to godless and meaningless rituals over and over. The church was the one that put itself over God's word in arrogance. \n \n [snip]\n \n \nIf you want to know about context, you can for instance find a copy of the Didache; this book was written somewhere between the years 50 and 120. Thus this is a very very early Christian book, and predates the compiling of the Bible. In it it talks about partaking in the Eucharist* - that is, the Communion of Jesus' Body and Blood. Many Protestants read the Bible and suggest that Jesus' commandment \"do this in memory of Me\" can be read symbolically. Yes, as it stands you can read it like that - but the Didache, a manual for Christians re-inforces the Orthdox position. Tradition says that it is the actual Body of Christ.\n Out off all the things the Catholic church holds on to, I am suprised every day that they have not thrown out the old transubstantiation belief. So if I take communion, then throw up, I should be vomitting up flesh and blood, which we can use to make a clone Jesus. Cool.\n \n \nSo Luther had no right to set up his own beliefs, but he did.Once Luther broke away, he himself then tried to set up a dogma to prevent further breaches. The very dogmitic approach of Catholicism he repeated, in his own fashion and he equally condemned anyone who didn't follow his preachings. He notoriously urged the suppression of Anabaptists (and he also didn't like the Jews)\n How hipocritical, first you said that he had the right to interpret the Bible for himself, then say he did not have the right to believe what he interpreted. The church was the ones condemning suppressing the protestants by murdering them.\n \n [snip]\n \n \n\n If you look to the New Testament, St. Paul was always preaching Church unity. St. Paul never said \"Ok guys, you now believe in Christ, go an worship the way you want to\"\n Good verse, now try actually learning about all the other things Paul taught.\n \n\n Most Protestants attempt to get around this when they talk of an 'invisible church' that they are all memebers of - that this church doesn't exist here on earth, but in heaven. Therefore it doesn't matter if one Protestant church has their service in one form, and another Protestant church does it another way\nWhy does it matter how their church service is performed? By your definition, people all over the world practice who worship in different ways, can't be Christian. You are just saying \"I am right because we have been doing this for this many years.\" Arrogance.\n \n \nThis is a nonsense, because St. Paul was continually urging Christians to NOT practice their own way; and to obey the Bishops etc. Early writers such as St. Clement of Rome (his Epistle dates 80-140), and St. Ignatius of Antioch (dating c.105-115) both new St. Peter and were taught directly by him.\n Both these writers continued in writing in the same way - obey bishops, unity of faith etc. They ellaborated on what St. Paul wrote, not contradict it.\n \n Luther, Calvin etc contradicted these teachings.\n We are to base our lives on what scripture says, not some institution that sets itself up higher than God. How was the church practicing unity when it tortured and killed people who disagreed with them?",

They were teaching that they could pay money and have their sins forgiven instead of just simply asking for it. \n \n \n Actually, the Church was NOT trying to keep a translation of the Bible from the faithful. The Church was trying to keep poor, faulty translations of the Bible from getting out there. One only has to research history to know this. Wycliff was not the first to translate the Bible into English. \n \n Have you ever heard of the Christian band Caedmon's Call? What was Caedmon's call? His call, as a Catholic monk, was to translate scripture into the vernacular. This occurred in the late 600s. In the 700s the Venerable Bede, Eadhelm (Bishop of Sherborne), Guthlac (a hermit), Egbert (Bishop of Holy Island). A while later there were translations by King Alfred the Great, Aelfric (Archbishop of Canterbury). There were other translations around 1150 and 1250. All of these years and years prior to the Reformation that has in time used Church control of the Bible as one of its motives. The above mentioned vernacular translations were only the ones in the varying tongues of England. (Even the Authorized Version--King James in the preface mentions prior translations by the Church) And this is not to mention the vernaculars that already existed in Spanish, Italian, Danish, French, Norwegian, Polish, Bohemian, and Hungarian. *information from Where We Got the Bible by Henry Graham\n \n \n \nWhat about \"we are saved by grace, through faith, not by works...\"? Also real and true saving faith will be accompanied by works. How exactly did Luther twist the scriptures? \n Quite interesting that you trivialize God's will and put the will of man over it.\n\n \n Actually, Luther twisted the scriptures by deleting 7 books from the Old Testament. 7 books that contained support for Catholic doctrines he did not support. 7 books that were accepted for 1500 years prior to his rebellion. Further twisting came in Luther's German translation of the Bible. I think the twisting remains in the Lutheran Bible to this day. He added the word \"alone\" to Romans 3:28. Then he called the epistle of James an \"epistle of straw.\" He even wanted to throw it out of the Bible. How can someone say that about the Bible if he believes it to be the word of God? \n \n \nHow hipocritical, first you said that he had the right to interpret the Bible for himself, then say he did not have the right to believe what he interpreted. The church was the ones condemning suppressing the protestants by murdering them.\n\n \n Actually, the Protestants murdered many more than the Catholics when the witch trials began. I think we both could have been more merciful.\n \n \n Besides the ones saying the \"magic words\" are the people saying the same Hail Mary over and over again in a vain attempt to pay for a sin that is already paid for. \n \n \n It may be interesting to you that Luther honored Mary and upheld most, if not all, of Catholic Marian doctrine. Yet why do modern day Protestants not hold to Luther's beliefs on this? Here is what Luther said of Mary:\n \n Luther accepted the Perpetual Virginity of Mary:\n \n \"Christ...was the only Son of Mary, and the Virgin Mary bore no children besides Him... \"brothers\" really means \"cousins\" here, for Holy Writ and the Jews always call cousins brothers.\" \n \n \"He, Christ, our Savior was the real and natural fruit of Mary's virginal womb...This was without the cooperation of a man, and she remained a virgin after that.\"\n (Sermons on John, chapters 1-4, 1537-39)\n \n Belief in the Immaculate Conception of Mary although he believed this should not be imposed on all believers:\n \n \"It is a sweet and pious belief that the infusion of Mary's soul was effected without original sin; so that in the very infusion of her soul she was also purified from original sin and adorned with God's gifts, receiving a pure soul infused by God; thus from the first moment she began to live she was free from all sin\" (Sermon: \"On the Day of the Conception of the Mother of God,\" 1527)\n \n \"She is full of grace, proclaimed to be entirely without sin-something exceedingly great. For God's grace fills her with everything good and makes her devoid of all evil. (Personal {\"Little\"} Prayer Book, 1522)\n \n Other quotes showing Luther's veneration of Mary:\n \n \"The veneration of Mary is inscribed in the very depths of the human heart. (Sermon, September 1, 1522)\n \n [She is the] \"highest woman and the noblest gem in Christianity after Christ...She is nobility, wisdom, and holiness personified. We can never honor her enough. Still honor and praise must be given to her in such a way as to injure neither Christ nor the Scriptures.\" (Sermon, Christmas, 1531)\n \n \"No woman is like you. You are more than Eve or Sarah, blessed above all nobility, wisdom, and sanctity.\" (Sermon, Feast of the Visitation, 1537)\n \n \"It is the consolation and the superabundant goodness of God, that man is able to exult in such a treasure. Mary is his true Mother, Christ is his brother, God is his father. (Sermon, Christmas, 1522)\n \n Quotes of Martin Luther were obtained on Dave Armstrong's website at http://ic.net/~erasmus/RAZ95.htm\n \n If you would like a more elaborate explanation of Catholic veneration of Mary that will dispel some misconceptions then go to the last post on the \"What's Wrong With Catholicism\" thread on Page 2 of the thread list (Post #44). See what you think of the scripture there.\n \n Peace.",

   "Chobo,\n \nSo do you think that it is possible to lose your salvation by sinning? To me this would be basically a cheapening of Christ's blood. Besides, I think that if a person is truly saved, he will be less inclined to murder, or any sin for that matter. Remember point five, perserverance of the saints.\n\n \n We had an in depth discussion on this topic on the \"Poll:Christianity\" thread.

Even Paul, an apostle of the Lord, believed he could lose his salvation.\n\n \n \n Yes we are in the process of a discussion in which you are failing. Christ redemptive work has been found perfect, and in His own words \"Finished\". The verses of Mays sons cannot mean cousins. Gone back to the greek many many times to double check and it is clear sons and daughters. Jesus brothers are real and children of the once virgin Mary. Note she married Joseph before Jesus was born, onkly by the direction of God Joseph waited until after the birth to consumate the relationship. Which they did. God told him not to put her away that this child was of the Lord. Therfore it was God's plan that she would one day fullfill her marriage rite with her husband. Mary was not blessed for any action on her own part, she like us was gifted with a savior. She deserves no praise for her part other than God found her life godly. She is not divine nor does she currently care about your prayers in her direction. There is but one mediator between God and Man and it is Jesus. \n \n I Timothy 2:5\n For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, \n \n Hebrews 8\n 1 Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;\n 2 A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.\n 3 For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.\n 4 For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:\n 5 Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.\n 6 But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.\n 7 For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.\n 8 For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:\n 9 Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.\n 10 For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:\n 11 And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.\n 12 For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.13 In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away.\n \n Hebrews 9\n 1 Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.\n 2 For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary.\n 3 And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;\n 4 Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;\n 5 And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.\n 6 Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.\n 7 But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:\n 8 The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:\n 9 Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;\n 10 Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.\n 11 But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;\n 12 Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.\n 13 For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh:\n 14 How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?\n 15 And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.\n 16 For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.\n 17 For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.\n 18 Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood.\n 19 For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,\n 20 Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you.\n 21 Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.\n 22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.\n 23 It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.\n 24 For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:\n 25 Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;\n 26 For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.\n 27 And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:\n 28 So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.\n \n Sorry so long this is good stuff. Not only do these verses show Jesus as the only mediator, but also they prove again eternal security. This is great only our God can be so wonderful as to make clear the plan of salvation to one and all. These vereses also show a fault in the calvinistic ideal of particular atonement. Check Hebrews 8:11 every man from greatest to the least.\n \n Praise God\n Praise God\n Praise God.",

They were teaching that they could pay money and have their sins forgiven instead of just simply asking for it. \n\n \n Wrong again. The Church existed from the day of Pentecost. The Bible was composed 300 years later. In those years the Church existed through Tradition. They put the Bible together. If they had authority to chose which books to include, then they obviously had authority to interpret scripture. In scripture too, Jesus commissioned the Apostles to go out and do in His name. The early church, if you read Acts, the Didache, the Epistles of Clement, Igantius et al shows quite clearly that an actual structured Church was established with priests, bishops and ceremonies. St. Paul himself always urged people to worship a united way.\n \n \n What about \"we are saved by grace, through faith, not by works...\"? Also real and true saving faith will be accompanied by works. How exactly did Luther twist the scriptures? \n\n \n Indeed he did, because you can pluck passages out of the Bible and establish a church based on those. Ooops, you've already done that!\n \n Baptists concentrate on baptism. Charismatics concentrate on the gifts of the Holy Spirit. Seventh Day Adventists concentrate on the Sabbath. All of them are 'bible-based'. All of them have taken texts out of the proper context.\n \n \n \nQuite interesting that you trivialize God's will and put the will of man over it.\n\n \n No, you've trivialised God into some kind of being that just randomly picks who's going to be saved and who's going to be condemned, regardless of what sort of people they are... because this is what Calvin believed.\n \n \nHa, holy tradition. Why even read the Bible when you can stick to godless and meaningless rituals over and over. The church was the one that put itself over God's word in arrogance. \n\n \n What tradition(s) do Orthodox believe in that are godless?\n \n \nOut off all the things the Catholic church holds on to, I am surprised every day that they have not thrown out the old transubstantiation belief. So if I take communion, then throw up, I should be vomiting up flesh and blood, which we can use to make a clone Jesus.

That is your right not to have respect for the institutions He established.\n \n \n How hypocritical, first you said that he had the right to interpret the Bible for himself, then say he did not have the right to believe what he interpreted. The church was the ones condemning suppressing the protestants by murdering them.\n\n \n Actually I stated it badly. He has the right to be wrong.\n \n \n Good verse, now try actually learning about all the other things Paul taught.\n Why does it matter how their church service is performed? By your definition, people all over the world practice who worship in different ways, can't be Christian. You are just saying \"I am right because we have been doing this for this many years.\" Arrogance.\n\n \n It matters how we worship God. God Himself sent down the ultimate sacrifice, Jesus Christ, as the Lamb of God. All Jesus' life He worshiped sacramentally, even to the last, when he practiced Passover (the Last Supper). No it is arrogance to suggest that you, a flawed and failed human being can be capable of understanding more of God than those who knew Him when He was here on earth.\n \n Peter spent 3 yrs with Christ. He then taught Clement and Ingatius. They in turn taught others. You, 2,000 years later come along and say, \"No, I won't listen to them. I am the ultimate arbiter of what is meant by Scripture... and I'll only look at the 23 books that they chose, I'll ignore all the other books that they revere\".\n \n \n We are to base our lives on what scripture says, not some institution that sets itself up higher than God. How was the church practicing unity when it tortured and killed people who disagreed with them?\n\n \n You have set the Bible up as the ultimate authority. The Church established the Bible, not the other way around.\n \n What of your own laws - do you need lawyers, judges and so on to interpret the laws, or are they all just understood. No, of course not, there's chaos, and likewise there's chaos in Christianity as everyone says that they are the ultimate judge in deciding Scripture.",

   "PART ONE\n \n \nYes we are in the process of a discussion in which you are failing.

Not only do these verses show Jesus as the only mediator, but also they prove again eternal security. This is great only our God can be so wonderful as to make clear the plan of salvation to one and all. These vereses also show a fault in the calvinistic ideal of particular atonement. Check Hebrews 8:11 every man from greatest to the least.\n\n \n How did the Church that Christ established interpret Scripture. Surely, they know better than you or I 2,000 years later.\n Let's look at what they wrote. (or do you suppose that the Church finished after the Book of Acts is complete)?\n Epistles of Clement, and Ignatius.\n \n \n I think that although we're reading the same book, we're interpreting it in vastly different ways.\n \n I know you believe that all Protestants are united by their belief in Jesus as personal Saviour, and the Bible, but this 'Invisible Church of the faithful' is in fact a doctrine that is not in the Bible. The Bible doesn't even point to it. It has never been good enough to have faith alone.\n \n I read Matthew 16:13-19 Jesus talks about establishing His church. This alone would not point to either of us being right or wrong. Nor would Eph 5:23 \"Christ is head of the Church\", Col 1:18 \"He is the head of the body, the Church\", 1 Cor 12:27 \"Now you are the body of Christ and members individually\" etc.\n \n However, if we look to how the Apostles did things...and although I can point to Clement of Rome, Ignatius of Antioch et al, I'll stick to the Bible for now.\n \n Firstly Jesus in John 20:21-23 said \"Peace to you! As the Father has sent Me, I also send you.\"... \"Receive the Holy Spirit. \"If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them...\" To me this means he's commissioning the Apostles to do things, to act in his name. This Apostleship that Christ annointed was deemed important enough that in Acts 1 we see the Apostles appoint someone to take the place of Judas. If everyone can be their own priest or bishop then the Apostles wounldn't have bothered about this, or they would have appointed everyone of the faithful to be bishops.\n \n Not only bishops, but deacons, and priests were appointed. The bishops were the defenders of the faith. Phillip the Deacon baptised an Ethiopian, but that was not enough? One of the Apostles had to lay his hands on him - the act of Chrismation - that of receiving the Holy Spirit. Remember too, that the Ethiopian had been reading Jewish scripture but admitted that he needed someone to guide him. Just reading the Holy Scripture was not enough to enter into Communion with Him.\n \n When the Chrisitans learnt that a pagan, Cornelius had found faith, they rushed to Chrismate him. They had to lay hands on him to bring him into the Church (Acts 10:19-48). They could have said, \"You've found faith... you've already been annointed by the Holy Spirit.\" They did not! How many new Churches have been founded by some man believing that the Holy Spirit has imparted some gift onto him and that he should move away and start preaching the Gospel according to these gifts? It is quite clear that this is un-Biblical. The gift of the Holy Spirit comes to the faithful, BUT only at the hands of an Apostle, or one appointed by them! This Apostolic Succession is in fact such a powerful argument that even some Protestant groups try to use it... namely the Anglican Church.\n \n If faith alone was imporatant, then the Bible would have ceased at the Resurrection. Instead it goes on to show the early church grew; how office-holders were appointed and how they functioned differently from the faithful as a whole, in otherwords, the Visible Church, here on earth. Paul's letters are full of remonstrations to the faithful. He never says \"Congratulations, you've found faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, you are acting now as good people, that is enough!\" NO! NO! NO! He continually draws them back into the fold of the faithful.\n \n There is a Protestant history site (http://www.christianitytoday.com/ch/57h/57h012.html) that talks about how the early Christians were thought by Pagans to be cannibals. Why did the Pagans think this? It was because the Christians claimed to be eating the Body of Christ. If they were doing this... was it important? I would say yes. Do you think that they did it if faith alone was all it took? In fact they died to keep doing it because they believed it was important. If it was important... why don't all Christian schisms and heresies do it? Surely it doesn't matter you say, as long as you have faith in Christ? Obviously this opinion of yours differs from the early church.\n \n Look at the Anglican Church... someone once told me once that he thought it was closer to the spirit of the early church than some others (I believe he were referring to us traditionalists). How is this possible when some Anglican communities have women priests, some have none? Some have Holy Communion in the form of the Eucharist, others just have bread. Some have homosexual priests, most have none. Would Paul have allowed such division? We see in the Bible that he ALWAYS called people back into line. ALWAYS! There was ONE faith, not the opportunity for many. The Early Church never left things at finding faith alone. There was never a multitude of doing things. Never did Paul say you are your own bishop, I'll let you all worship the way you want, teach they way you want.\n \n end part one",

No!\n In his letter to the Corinthians he says\n \"42. The Apostles received the Gospel for us from the Lord Jesus Christ; Jesus Christ was sent forth from God. So then Christ is from God, and the Apostles are from Christ. Both therefore came of the will of God in the appointed order. Having therefore received a charge, and having been fully assured through the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ and confirmed in the word of God with full assurance of the Holy Ghost, they went forth with the glad tidings that the kingdom of God should come. So preaching everywhere in country and town, they appointed their first-fruits, when they had proved them by the Spirit, to be bishops and deacons unto them that should believe. And this they did in no new fashion; for indeed it had been written concerning bishops and deacons from very ancient times; for thus saith the scripture in a certain place, I will appoint their bishops in righteousness and their deacons in faith.\"\n \n Not just anyone is appointed a deacon - yet all the community were faithful. Is this against the Bible? No!\n \n \"57. Ye therefore that laid the foundation of the sedition, submit yourselves unto the presbyters, and receive chastisement unto repentance, bending the knees of your heart. Learn to submit yourselves, laying aside the arrogant and proud stubbornness of your tongue. For it is better for you to be found little in the flock of Christ and to have your name on God's roll, than to be had in exceeding honour and yet be cast out from the hope of Him. For thus saith the All-virtuous Wisdom; Behold I will pour out for you a saying of My breath, and I will teach you My word. Because I called and ye obeyed not, and I held out words and ye heeded not, but made My counsels of none effect, and were disobedient unto My reproofs; therefore I also will laugh at your destruction, and will rejoice over you when ruin cometh upon you, and when confusion overtakcth you suddenly, and your overthrow is at hand like a whirlwind, or when anguish and beleaguerment come upon you. For it shall be, when ye call upon Me, yet will I not hear you. Evil men shall seek Me, and shall not find Me: for they hated wisdom, and chose not the fear of the Lord, neither would they give heed unto My counsels, but mocked at My reproofs. Therefore they shall eat the fruits of their own way, and shall be filled with their own ungodliness. For because they wronged babes, they shall be slain, and inquisition shall destroy the ungodly. But he that heareth Me shall dwell safely trusting in hope, and shall be quiet from fear of all evil.\"\n \n He calls people to submit to their Church elders. Is this anti-Biblical? No!\n \n \"59. But if certain persons should be disobedient unto the words spoken by Him through us, let them understand that they will entangle themselves in no slight transgression and danger; but we shall be guiltless of this sin. And we will ask, with instancy of prayer and supplication, that the Creator of the universe may guard intact unto the end the number that hath been numbered of His elect throughout the whole world, through His beloved Son Jesus Christ, through whom He called us from darkness to light, from ignorance to the full knowledge of the glory of His Name.\"\n \n Obedience is through the Church established by Christ.\n \n Okay... you have a Church you say, you have and obey Church elders... but who appointed them? Were they appointed by the Holy Spirit through succession from the Apostles? Do they teach the teachings of the Church that the Apostles founded? Well, with Anglicans you can perhaps answer yes to one, (other Protestants couldn?t even do that) but sometimes for the latter, because as I've mentioned in Anglicanism anything goes. You don't even need to believe in the resurrection to be an Anglican minister. You will know the tree by the fruit it bears! And also, you claim fellowship with people who don't believe the same things as you... who worship in different ways.\n \n There is ONE God. There is ONE Church. The ONE Church that God established had ONE teaching. ONE way of worship. Paul, Peter all of them had already established ways of appointing Church elders. They called people to ONE faith. It is a stream running through the New Testament! And, it continues to this day in One church!\n \n For you to be right you'd need to show how the Protestant Churches teaches one faith, one form of worship and claims to be the one and only church as established by God. It doesn't! The Anglican Church for example always says that it doesn't matter in these things... as long as you have faith in Jesus Christ as your Savior, then it doesn't matter how you worship... which means the forms of worship in the Anglican Church don't matter; same for other Protestant Churches. The result is not only against what Paul would have wanted, it means that there is no importance, or meaning in that churches forms of worship. Therefore, why bother even arguing over whether to have women priests ? oh, that?s right, because traditionally they never had them!\n \n To be faithful to that Church as established by God, you can't have many ways of worship. Faith alone is not enough. Paul recognized this... will you?\n \n End part two",

   "Part Three\n \n In light of these facts, the Church IS visible. It is a body of people united in Christ through a structure that teaches ONE truth.\n IN SUMMARY\n The Church which Jesus Christ founded became firmly established...\n Acts 2:1-13, the Holy Spirit descended upon the Apostles and filled them with the Spirit of Truth. They were endowed with many languages so that they could teach all nations, and every person would understand each in his own native tongue. Jesus had commanded them to teach all the nations in Matthew 28:19.\n Eph 1:22, Eph 5:23, Col 1:18, Jesus Christ is the Head of His Church.\n Eph 5:30, Col 1:18,24, we are the Body of Christ, the Church. Whatever happens to the body is registered in the Head.\n Eph 5:25, Jesus Christ loves His Church which He calls His Bride.\n John 14:16-17, the Spirit of Truth, the Holy Spirit, will dwell forever within the Church which Jesus founded. Once again the perpetually and indefectibility of the Catholic Church is guaranteed by GOD.\n 1Tim 3:15, the Church is the pillar and mainstay of the truth.\n Eph 5:27, the Church is Holy and Spotless.\n Acts 8:27-40, 2Pet 1:20-21, the Church discerns Holy Scripture, as moved by the Holy Spirit.\n Acts 2:41,47, Acts 5:14, Acts 6:7, Acts 9:31 the new Church grows and spreads.\n Acts 2:42,20:7, the Eucharistic Communion, the Mass, is celebrated in the new Church, and it is celebrated on Sunday, and now every moment of every day, and not just the Sabbath of the Old Covenant.\n Galatians 2:2, the leaders of the Church consult with one another about divine revelation.\n Acts 5:29, the Church must obey GOD rather than men.\n Acts 1:26, the leaders of the Church vote among themselves.\n Acts 20:28, the Holy Spirit placed Bishops in the Church to rule the Church of GOD.\n Hebrews 7:11-17, a new Christian priesthood is initiated according to the order of Melchisedech. It replaced the Old Covenant priesthood of the order of Aaron.\n Hebrews 13:17, 1Thess 5:12, St. Paul stressed the importance of obedience to the superiors, as they are charged with having to account for the souls of the faithful.\n 1Cor 15:9, 1Tim 1:13, St. Paul called himself the 'least of the Apostles', and said he was 'not worthy to be an Apostle' because he persecuted the Church of GOD. A clear warning to persecutors of the Catholic Church. Paul repented once he was shown his error.\n 1Cor 10:32, St. Paul warned all not to be a 'stumbling block' to the Church of GOD.\n 1Cor 11:22, St. Paul warns, 'despisers of the Church of GOD will not be commended'.\n Matthew 28:19-20, the Church which Jesus Christ founded is given the teaching authority for the whole world.\n 1John 4:6, those who know GOD listen to His Church; those who do not know GOD do not listen to His Church. By this we will know the Spirit of Truth, and the spirit of error.\n John 15:16, 1Cor 3:10-11, Matthew 18:17-18, the Church is self propagating.\n John 15:15-16, Acts 13:3,14:22,19:6, 1Cor 3:10-11, 1Tim 3:8-13,4:14,5:22, 2Tim 1:6, Titus 1:5, knowing that the Apostles will not live forever, provision is made to perpetuate the clergy by the 'laying on of hands' for new Priests, Deacons, and Bishops. This is the Sacrament of Holy Orders.\n 1Cor 12:28, Eph 4:11-12, St. Paul said, GOD has placed some in His Church as, Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Pastors, and Teachers. GOD has bestowed upon His Church, miracles, gifts of healing, services of help, power of administration, and the speaking of tongues.\n 1Cor 3:2, St. Paul said he feeds us with milk and not solid food as we are not ready for it. Our minds have to be open and receptive, and not have the blindness of Paul (Acts 9:8-9), in order to receive the revelations from GOD.\n John 14:25-26,16:12-15, The Holy Spirit 'will' teach the Church all the truth and all things. The word 'will', indicates future tense. Jesus said, \"Many things yet I have to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.\" All truth will be taught to the Church. Here Jesus dispensed the authority for doctrine to be defined by His Church.\n \n Historical Note:\n Clement is counted as the third bishop of Rome (after the apostles). His predecessors are Linus and Cletus (or Anacletus, or Anencletus), about whom almost nothing is known. They are simply names on a list. Clement is a little more than this, chiefly because he wrote a letter to the Corinthians, which was highly valued by the early church, and has been preserved to the present day. The letter itself does not carry his name, but is merely addressed from the congregation at Rome to the congregation at Corinth. However, a letter from Corinth to Rome a few decades later refers to \"the letter we received from your bishop Clement, which we still read regularly.\" Other early writers are unanimous in attributing the letter to Clement. Perhaps because this letter made his name familiar, he has had an early anonymous sermon (commonly called II Clement) attributed to him, and is a character in some early religious romances (e.g. the Clementine Recognitions).\n \n The letter is occasioned by the fact that a group of Christians at Corinth had banded together against their leaders and had deposed them from office. Clement writes to tell them that they have behaved badly, and to remind them of the importance of Christian unity and love. He speaks at length of the way in which each kind of official in the church has his own function for the good of the whole. The letter is an important witness to the early Christian understanding of Church government, but an ambiguous witness in that we are never told precisely why the Corinthians had deposed their leaders, and therefore the letter can be read as saying that presbyters ought not to be deposed without reasonable grounds, or as saying that they cannot be deposed on any grounds at all. \n \n Clement was martyred in 101 during the persecution of Emperor Trajan.\n \n \n \n \nPraise God\n Praise God\n Praise God.\n\n Why do you 'praise' God? I thought you're already saved?\n \n Your buddy, Martin Luther said\n \"In the morning, when you rise, make the sign of the cross and say, \"In the name of God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen.\" Then, kneeling or standing, say the Apostles' Creed and the Lord's Prayer. ... In the evening, when you retire, make the sign of the cross and say, \"In the name of God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen.\" Then, kneeling or standing, say the Apostles' Creed and the Lord's Prayer. ...\"\n from The Small Catechism: Morning and Evening Prayers.\n \n Sounds awfully like he's trying to establish formal worship. Where is the Bible references for this particular form of worship? Why is this better than any other?\n \n He?s trying to have his cake and eat it.\n \n Luther?s Church is man-made; by Martin Luther. My church is God-made; by the Holy Spirit at Pentecost.\n \n Luther persecuted non-believers; Catholics, Anabaptists, Jews.\n He became just as dogmatic as the Church he rejected!\n \n \n \n End part three.

   "Wow. So many posts.\n \nWhat have you got against prayer? Oh, that's right! You're already saved. You don't need to do anything else.\n What are you talking about? Prayer is absoloutely essential in a relationship with Christ. I never said it wasn't needed.\n \nWrong again. The Church existed from the day of Pentecost. The Bible was composed 300 years later. In those years the Church existed through Tradition. They put the Bible together. If they had authority to chose which books to include, then they obviously had authority to interpret scripture. In scripture too, Jesus commissioned the Apostles to go out and do in His name. The early church, if you read Acts, the Didache, the Epistles of Clement, Igantius et al shows quite clearly that an actual structured Church was established with priests, bishops and ceremonies. St. Paul himself always urged people to worship a united way.\nThe church that was set up by Holy Rome was not the same church set up by the apostles, the archeological evidences of apostolic succession I find are extremely sketchy at best and unreliable.\n \nIndeed he did, because you can pluck passages out of the Bible and establish a church based on those. Ooops, you've already done that!\n \n Baptists concentrate on baptism. Charismatics concentrate on the gifts of the Holy Spirit. Seventh Day Adventists concentrate on the Sabbath. All of them are 'bible-based'. All of them have taken texts out of the proper context.\n...and Catholics concentrate on a rigid and formal worship in which there must be a mediator between man and God, the very barrier Christ had come to abolish.\n \n \nNo, you've trivialised God into some kind of being that just randomly picks who's going to be saved and who's going to be condemned, regardless of what sort of people they are... because this is what Calvin believed.\nHe predestines who is going to follow Him according to His will. According to complete free will, you are the one saving yourself because of your works or because that you chose Him instead of the other way around. This seems to be a gross diefication of man and his will.\n \nWhat tradition(s) do Orthodox believe in that are godless?\nVeneration of the Saints and of Mary, having to have an authoritarian to interpret the scriptures for you, saying set prayers to say over and over to \"pay\" for sins, confessing to an authoritarian instead of directly to God; among others that totally exclude God from the Church that He meant.\n \nYes, you can go against the teachings of Jesus, and treat His body like that. That is your right not to have respect for the institutions He established.\n I can respect the institution that he set up, but I do not have to respect teachings that are unbiblical and detrimental to the message Jesus gave to us. \n \n \nIt matters how we worship God. God Himself sent down the ultimate sacrifice, Jesus Christ, as the Lamb of God. All Jesus' life He worshiped sacramentally, even to the last, when he practiced Passover (the Last Supper). No it is arrogance to suggest that you, a flawed and failed human being can be capable of understanding more of God than those who knew Him when He was here on earth.\nLet me state again, it does not matter how you worship, what God looks at is our attitude to see if we are really doing it for His glory and not just to be seen and heard by men. There is nothing necessarily wrong with formal worship, its just that you can sink into a habit of meaningless motions that do not give honor and glory to God, which is exactly what the Pharisees had done, and was repeated by the corrupted church.\n \n \nPeter spent 3 yrs with Christ. He then taught Clement and Ingatius. They in turn taught others. You, 2,000 years later come along and say, \"No, I won't listen to them. I am the ultimate arbiter of what is meant by Scripture... and I'll only look at the 23 books that they chose, I'll ignore all the other books that they revere\".\nWait, suddenly your interpretation of scripture is the only one that is valid? And are you saying that you can possibly follow EVERYTHING that your saints say? How about how Augustine said that a woman who does not have as many children as she possibly can is guilty of murder? If you are only following because it is tradition, and that is the only reason, you have no love for God but for fallible teachings of men.\n \n \nYou have set the Bible up as the ultimate authority. The Church established the Bible, not the other way around.\nThe word of God is supposed to be the ultimate authority, not a book. The Bible has errors, but not God's word. Understand?\n \n \nWhat of your own laws - do you need lawyers, judges and so on to interpret the laws, or are they all just understood. No, of course not, there's chaos, and likewise there's chaos in Christianity as everyone says that they are the ultimate judge in deciding Scripture.\n\n Because I don't subscribe to your interpretation you say that I am arrogant, yet I should take a fallible man's word for it because he is part of some institution which does not adhere to the written word. I'll take my own interpretation any day thankyou. emoticon_xhoho",

   "Wow. So many posts.\n\n \n It's a big topic!\n \n Quote:montalban\n What have you got against prayer? Oh, that's right! You're already saved. You don't need to do anything else.\n \n \nWhat are you talking about? Prayer is absolutely essential in a relationship with Christ. I never said it wasn't needed.\n\n \n I raised this because you were having a go at Catholics who pray! You mentioned the Rosary/Hail Mary.\n \n Montalban: Wrong again.

Next, if you believe this, then you must also say that they had no right to compose the Bible! What gave people 300 years after the even the right to chose which books go into the Bible? Why do you accept their decision?\n \n Montalban: Indeed he did, because you can pluck passages out of the Bible and establish a church based on those. Ooops, you've already done that!\n Baptists concentrate on baptism. Charismatics concentrate on the gifts of the Holy Spirit. Seventh Day Adventists concentrate on the Sabbath. All of them are 'bible-based'. All of them have taken texts out of the proper context.\n\n \n You're talking past the point. The Church that was founded in Rome was founded by St. Peter! (and in Antioch). But you're mixing me up with Catholics. I am an Orthodox. We can show Apostolic Succession in the see of Antioch for e.g.\n \n \n...and Catholics concentrate on a rigid and formal worship in which there must be a mediator between man and God, the very barrier Christ had come to abolish.\n\n \n Again with the Catholics! Christ followed a Sacramental existence. His whole life was a reflection of this. He is the Lamb of God! That is why, like the Passover lamb, his bones were not broken, and he was without blood. And as the Orthodox Church put the Bible together, the Bible exists in the context of the Church. The same Church that lived a sacramental life, put the Bible together!\n \n If Christ had wished to stop sacramental worship, he would have done so in His own time here on earth. Right till the Last Supper; he celebrated as a Jew!\n \n Why do Christians have baptism or marriage? These are 'acts'. A man doesn't just say to a woman \"I will declare my everlasting love to you\" and she accepts that (though she can ). They go through a ceremony celebrating before the community their love before Christ! Baptism and marriage are sacraments. Jesus attended a wedding. Jesus got baptised. Your life is to say, \"NO! I reject the type of life that Jesus lived!\"\n \n \n Montalban:\n No, you've trivialised God into some kind of being that just randomly picks who's going to be saved and who's going to be condemned, regardless of what sort of people they are... because this is what Calvin believed.\n \n \nHe predestines who is going to follow Him according to His will. According to complete free will, you are the one saving yourself because of your works or because that you chose Him instead of the other way around. This seems to be a gross diefication of man and his will.\n\n \n How can Free Will and predestination as Calvin put it co-exist? Calvin said it doesn't matter what you do, so you don't have to exercise Free Will. I suggest you read James Hogg \"Confession of a Justified Sinner\".\n \n Montalban:\n What tradition(s) do Orthodox believe in that are godless?\n \n [QUOTE=Chobo Char]Veneration of the Saints and of Mary, having to have an authoritarian to interpret the scriptures for you, saying set prayers to say over and over to \"pay\" for sins, confessing to an authoritarian instead of directly to God; among others that totally exclude God from the Church that He meant.\n \n You've given a list. What is wrong with venerating Mary? Mary is the Mother of God, she is like no other woman on earth. \"Blessed are though among women.\" Also in Luke \"I will be blessed through the ages\"\n What is wrong with praying? A moment ago you seemed to be in favour of it. Do you not attend church service at a set time? Or is the building open 24/7 and people rock on up when they feel like it?\n Next, confession in Orthodoxy is not to the priest at all, so you are wrong there.\n On interpretation; you are still free to agree or not with the interpretation as given. Do you ever discuss things with a priest/minister? Would you say that he might know more than the majority of your church? Further, you just concentrate on Scripture, if it is by true faith based on Scriptures that saves you, then you've condemned the Christians who existed in a Bible-less Church for it's first 300 years of existence.\n \n Quote:\n Yes, you can go against the teachings of Jesus, and treat His body like that. That is your right not to have respect for the institutions He established.\n \n \nI can respect the institution that he set up, but I do not have to respect teachings that are unbiblical and detrimental to the message Jesus gave to us.\n\n \n You said you'd vomit his flesh out. He said \"Take all of you, eat this, this is my body!\" The early Christians were satirised by pagans because they were thought to be cannibals; because the Christians believed that the Eucharist is the Body of Christ - not a mere symbol. You have made it symbolic, by interpreting the Bible differently from those who wrote it.\n \n Montalban: It matters how we worship God. God Himself sent down the ultimate sacrifice, Jesus Christ, as the Lamb of God. All Jesus' life He worshiped sacramentally, even to the last, when he practiced Passover (the Last Supper).

You had a go at formal prayer before, but now you're saying it doesn't matter, so if it doesn't matter, how can it be against God?\n \n If it doesn't matter - why are there so many differences in the Protestant Churches? Some have women priests, some believe the Communion is the Body of Christ, some don't have any communion, just prayer sessions - that's right! Because it doesn't matter! All the arguments amongst yourselves over the ordination of women is therefore pointless - it doesn't matter. You've stripped all meaning from worship of Christ!\n \n Quote:\n Peter spent 3 yrs with Christ. He then taught Clement and Ignatius. They in turn taught others. You, 2,000 years later come along and say, \"No, I won't listen to them.

The exact same argument can be used against the plethora of Protestant teachings. You admit men are fallible, yet you're quite happy being the one to interpret God's Will! This is odd! We as Orthodox believed that as our Church was founded by the Holy Spirit, it is without error. People within it can be in error, but the Church is not.\n \n But you've missed the point. It is the Church that also interprets the teachings of the Church Fathers. You are taking again, words out of meaning - what Augustine said, out of the context of the Church.\n \n It is not MY interpretation, it is the Churches. I agree with it.\n \n Montalban:\n You have set the Bible up as the ultimate authority. The Church established the Bible, not the other way around.\n \n \nThe word of God is supposed to be the ultimate authority, not a book. The Bible has errors, but not God's word.

I'll take my own interpretation any day thankyou. \n\n \n Yes, it's NOT MY INTERPRETATION. IT IS THE CHURCHES. You've stated everyone is flawed, yet you're quite happy to suggest you're capable of interpreting Scripture - that is arrogance, and it contradicts your stance on fallibility.\n \n The Church is infallible. The Bible is infallible. If you believe otherwise, then again you're setting yourself up as judge... and you're fallible.\n \n Jesus Christ doesn't make mistakes! When He chose 12 Apostles, He knew that individually they were all fallible, but He chose them because together He could entrust His teachings to them. He was correct. For 300 years they carried His teachings before they even compiled the Bible.\n \n The Apostles weren't alive at the time the Bible was set together. How then did Jesus' word carry down through successive ages? Because each person in the Apostolic Succession has received the gifts of the Holy Spirit through the act of Chrismation.",

   "\n I Timothy 2:5\n For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, \n\n \n Yes, there is one mediator. No one gets to the Father except through Jesus. But we can intercede for others in the body of Christ, we can pray for them, and God hears our prayers (Revelation 5:8). \n \n You may want to read the entire chapter from which you quoted the above verse. 1 Timothy 2:1, \"First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all men, for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, godly and respectful in every way. This is good and it is acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.\" \n \n What did Paul mean by asking men to make prayers, intercessions, and supplications? \n \n Why can intercede? Because we have been given the grace and knowledge of God through his son Jesus...because we are \"children of God, and if children, then heirs, heirs of God, FELLOW heirs with Christ, provided that we suffer with him   in order that we may also be glorified with him.\" (Romans 8:16-17) \n \n Why? Because \"we are ambassadors of Christ, God making his appeal through us...Working together with him, then, we entreat you...\" (2 Corinthians 5:20 and 6:1) \n \n Why? Because Christ told us to take up our cross and follow him. We can participate in redemptive suffering and intercession because Christ has granted us this power by his all sufficient sacrifice and through baptism he has joined us to his body. (Colossians 1:24) \n \n This is the way Catholics intercede--as Paul intended, as Christ commanded. Our intercession takes away nothing from the glory of Christ. \n \n I realize that it is difficult to be challenged on traditions that you hold dear. But the fact is that scripture does not support eternal security. I have never and will never argue that Christ's sacrifice was not sufficient. \n \n I must reiterate this from Hebrews 10: \n \"For if we sin deliberately AFTER receiving the knowledge of the truth, THERE NO LONGER REMAINS A SACRIFICE FOR SINS, but a fearful prospect of judgment, and a fury of fire which will consume the adversaries. A man who has violated the law of Moses dies without mercy at the testimony of two or three witnesses. How much worse punishment do you think will be deserved by the man who has spurned the Son of God, and profaned the blood of the covenant by WHICH HE WAS  SANCTIFIED, and outraged the Spirit of grace? For we know him who said,'Vengeance is mine, I will repay.' And again, 'The Lord will judge his people.' It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.\"\n \n What do you think it means that there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins? What does judgment day mean to you? Does a fury of fire sound familiar? Look at Hebrews 6:4-7 for confirmation.\n \n I must ask you the same thing I asked Epaphras. Have you reconciled your belief with these verses?: Matthew 7:21, Matthew 24:13, Romans 11:22, Philippians 2:12, 1 Corinthians 9:27, 1 Corinthians 10:11-12, Galatians 5:4, 2 Timothy 2:11-13, Hebrews 6:4-7, Hebrews 10:26-27\n \n I can appreciate the verses you supplied from Hebrews but one must keep in mind that the author is comparing sacrifices of the Mosaic Law with Jesus' eternal sacrifice. The old sacrifices have no effect. How can we be sure of this? Look at Hebrews 10:4, \"For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins.\" These are the types of sacrifices of which the author speaks. How do we know? Because he later states in Hebrews 13:16, \"Do not neglect to do good and to share what you have, for such sacrifices   are pleasing to God.\n \n Jesus' sacrifice is all-sufficient, complete and a historical fact. Nothing can take that away. His sacrifice is outside of time and space and therefore perpetual and eternal. Man has the opportunity for salvation throughout all of history IF he follows the plan of salvation that God put forth. If he does not follow God's plan then his \"end is to be burned\" as Hebrews says.",

   "Lappster,\n \nMary was not blessed for any action on her own part, she like us was gifted with a savior. She deserves no praise for her part other than God found her life godly. She is not divine nor does she currently care about your prayers in her direction. There is but one mediator between God and Man and it is Jesus.\n\n \n For starters, let me recommend that you read The Perpetual Virginity of Mary: Against Helividius by Saint Jerome circa 383 A.D.\n \n Secondly, let me re-post the entry of which I was speaking that I originally posted in \"What's Wrong with Catholicism.\" You can tell me if you believe it is unscriptural. Here it is:\n \n Mary has been the closest human to God in all of history past, present, and future.\n \n Mary is the Queen of heaven and your mother, the mother of the Church, the mother of us all. Mary is the Mother of Salvation. Read the entire 12th chapter of Revelation  . Who do you think \"brought forth a male child, one who is to rule all the nations?\" (Rev 12:5) \"Then the dragon went off to make war on the rest of her offspring, on those who keep the commandments of God and bear testimony to Jesus.\" (Rev 12:17) Do you keep the commandments and bear testimony to Jesus? If so, then you are Mary's child.\n \n Refer to the 4th commandment: Honor your father and your mother. Jesus was without sin as it says in Hebrews. Jesus kept the commandments perfectly. If Jesus kept the commandments then he honored his mother. Can anyone keep the commandments better then Jesus? Then how must he have honored his mother? Do you honor YOUR mother, Mary? \n \n Mary \"is blessed among women.\" Mary states also that \"ALL generations shall call me blessed.\" (Luke 1:48) Does our generation call her blessed? Blessed among women? Yes. Blessed among any human past, present, or future? Yes. Why do I say this? Because Jesus was not created, he was begotten. He was not a human creation. Mary, on the other hand, was a human creation. However, she had a more intimate union with God than any human has experienced and will ever experience. No one has been closer to God than Mary. She held God in her womb. Consider this quotation, \"I have long recognized the unique vocation of our Lady, called to the highest honor  among all created beings. It is a fact of history that, if true honor is not paid to her as the Mother of God, people put our Lord in her place as the highest of creation  rather than adoring him as God Incarnate.\" Rev. Msgr. Graham Leonard from The Path to Rome  (emphasis mine). \n \n Mary is not only the mother of God but also the bride of God. It is written in scripture that the Holy Spirit overshadowed her. Mary was betrothed to God.\n \n Mary is the ark of the New Covenant. The Old Testament Ark is only a type. It is a type that prefigures the perfection and reality of the New Testament ark. Consider the following parallels:\n \n David rose and went up to the hill country of Judea. (2 Sam 6:2-4)\n Mary rose and went up to the hill country of Judea. (Luke 1:39)\n \n David asked, \"Who am I that the ark of the Lord should come to me?\" (2 Sam 6:9) \n Elizabeth asked, \"Who am I that the mother of my Lord should come to me? (Luke 1:43)\n \n The Ark stayed in the House of Obededom for 3 months. (2 Sam 6:11)\n Mary (the new ark) stayed in Elizabeth's house for 3 months. (Luke 1:56)\n \n David's response to the Ark was to leap and dance. (2 Sam 6:14)\n John the Baptist responded to Mary by leaping in his mother's womb (Luke 1:41)\n \n The tabernacle that housed the Ark was covered or overshadowed by the glory cloud and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. (Exodus 40:34-35)\n The Holy Spirit overshadowed Mary as told in the Annunciation. (Luke 1:35)\n \n The ark contained the Law/Lord of God in the Ten Commandments, the urn of manna, and the staff of the true priesthood of Aaron. (Deut 10:3-5, Heb 9:4)\n Mary contained the Law/Word of God in flesh, the bread of life, and the true priest. (Matthew 1:23, Luke 1:35, John 1:1, 14, John 6:31-33, Heb 3:1) \n \n Luke knew scripture! Do you know how sacred the Ark of the Covenant was in the Old Testament? If anyone but the high priest touched it or looked on it then they died (1 Samuel 6:19 and 2 Samuel 6:7)-a good reason that Joseph dared not touch the Ark of the New Covenant. Is it coincidence that John says he saw the ark of the covenant in Revelation 11:19  then he begins describing the portent of Mary? (based upon Mary: The Mother of God  video from Steve Ray's Footprints of God  series).\n \n Mary was the perfect disciple. She was stronger than Peter who denied Christ 3 times and the other apostles that fled at Christ's crucifixion. Her words show how willingly she followed God, \"Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.\" (Luke 1:38) Jesus gave her to the \"disciple whom he loved\" at the Cross. Why is he entrusting her to someone else's protection if he took her lightly? Why to the disciple whom he loved? Mary had an intimate relationship with the apostles as seen with her relationship with John and her presence with the apostles praying shortly after the death and appearance of Christ. (Acts 1:12)\n \n We ask Mary to intercede for us with her prayers. We ask her to pray to Jesus for us just as you ask someone here on earth to pray for you. Her ability to intercede is fact and can be seen in her intercession at the wedding of Cana. Jesus told her it was not his time but he ended up performing the miracle of turning water to wine at her request. This is concrete in scripture if you read 1 Timothy 2:1, \"First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all men.\" This is written just before the line Protestants quote on the one mediator. Another concrete example of the acceptance of prayer for intercession can be found in Revelation 8:3 where it describes the prayers of saints being presented before God. So we ask the saints to pray for us. We do not pray to dead people because the saints are not dead, they are living in heaven.\n \n More on the \"brothers of Jesus\" later on the Theotokos thread.\n \n Peace.",

   "Ha, technically it IS your interpretation, one that says that you HAVE to agree with what the church says. Everyone's view is an interpretation.\n \n I've chosen to go with MY interpretation, because it would be what I think is in agreement with God's word. Even the Bible says that you should test and affirm things for yourself.\n \n And the church, the Bible, and any believer is fallible. They are not God.\n\n \n You could term my interpretation in these words. However, the truth of the Church would still be there regardless. I just happen to agree with it.\n \n \nP.S. What exactly is the difference between Catholic and Orthodox? I thought that the only difference was Orthodox was against the use of statues but not icons?\n\n \n Orthodox use icons.\n \n Here is the Very Brief History of the Orthodox and Catholic Churches - by Montalban (some of these 'facts' may be disputed by Maximus)\n \n Jesus chose 12 Apostles. Jesus commissioned them to act in His name. He promised them the gifts of the Holy Spirit. At Pentecost, the Holy Spirit came to the 12 - who were the first bishops, that is, the keepers of the truth, because they were the closest to Jesus. Anyone could become a Christian, but not all could hold this office.\n \n In almost all cases, the gifts of the Holy Spirit were only passed onto a few; and only then by the laying of hands. Thus when the Roman centurion became faithful, faith was not enough, he still had to have someone administer to him the power of the Church.\n \n The Church debated whether to take Christianity to the Gentiles. As a group, they agreed to do this. This could be said to be the first Ecumenical Council (that is, group meeting). The first Bishopric was at Jerusalem.\n \n As the Church spread throughout the Roman world, other Bishoprics were established. The principal ones became those at Rome, Alexandria, Jerusalem, and Antioch.\n \n We Orthodox believe that the structure of this Church, whilst headed by Peter, was collegiate in form, thus Paul was able to argue against Peter.\n \n When the Empire accepted Christianity, Constantine established the world's first dedicated Christian capital; Constantinople. The Bishop of Constantinople soon ranked with the other principal ones.\n \n Rome was always first in honour; like the chairman at a board of directors.\n \n The Church sifted through all the writings that existed up to that point and put together the Bible.\n \n When the Roman Empire was severed in two, the Western half eventually collapsed. The main bishoprics were separated from their 'chairman' in Rome, and because none themselves were first in honour, continued with the collegiate form of organisation.\n \n In the West, the Bishop of Rome (the Pope) first sought protection from the east, but by 800 had seen the rise of a new power in the West - the Franks. In turn, he looked to them for protection. Furthermore, as the west had been disrupted, as new churches were established there, for the most part they were established at the behest of Rome. Thus they all looked to a single bishop for leadership.\n \n In the East, the Church continued it's collegiate form. When they moved into new areas to preach, they would basically say \"Okay, Slavs, you've now learnt from us, we've made some of you priests, some bishops, the Bible is now in your own language, you can now run things for yourselves; but we'll all keep in contact to keep matters of faith united\"\n \n Thus arose a series of 'national' churches. Russian Orthodox, Moldavian Orthodox, Bulgarian Orthodox, etc. Each administratively separate, and in a sense equal with all the other churches, but all united by common doctrines and the same liturgy (church service - though spoken in the language of the people).\n \n Relations between east and west had never been fully severed. But, because each church had grown administratively different, things couldn't work out. In the west, you had one church supreme over all others, directing downwards to the very small offices, all churches, regardless of nation, spoke Latin. In the east, a collection of autonomous churches, each proud of their individuality, but also of their common heritage.\n \n Matters came to a head when the Roman Church, without calling an Ecumenical Council, decided to change the wording of the Nicene Creed. The Roman Church believed that, as it was the supreme church, it had the right to do so. The eastern churches, believing that all the churches needed to agree to this action, believed that Rome had over-stepped it's role.\n \n By the mid-1000s there was such animosity between them that they imposed excommunications on each other. (which have now been lifted).\n \n We Orthodox believe that our church was always a collection of brother-bishops. Romans believe it was always a church headed by one, and thus his successors.\n \n \n \n \n As to icons, this is an area that touches on what is Orthodox doctrine. In Orthodoxy, because of this 'collegiate' form, what is Orthodox doctrine, has to be accepted by the whole church.\n \n In the late 700s, there was a move in Constantinople to destroy all icons, as being idolatrous. This period is known as the iconoclasm. It was agreed to by a meeting of bishops, but was never accepted by the people. It was thus never Orthodox doctrine. During this time, the Bishop of Rome maintained 'orthodoxy' by insisting that icons had their proper place.",

Has it been corrupted?

We arn't praying the same on Earth as we are in heaven. Those saints in heaven you read of in Revelation are us. Specifically those who will be persicuted for His anme sake. No doubt they are alive this event is post rapture.\n\n \n We do not pray to dead people. Our God is a God of the living, not of the dead. (Mk 12:26-27, Luke 16:19-30, luke 23:43, Mk 9:4). We are promised eternal LIFE. Do not forget the living presence of Elijah and Moses at the Transfiguration. And the elders in Revelation were living souls in heaven. They were not dead. They were not angels because the angels were mentioned separately. Who were they? Unless there is a species besides humans and angels that we have not heard of, then this seems to be evidence that human souls live and are in action in heaven. Remember also that we are united in the mystical body of Christ as believers.\n \n Now, it is true that the saints mentioned in Revelation are the living Christians on earth. But their prayers are submitted to God nonetheless. Why do they pray? They petition God, as Paul tells us to do (Rom 15:30, Col 4:3, 1 Thess 5:25, 2 Thess 3:1, Eph 6:18,19, 1 Tim 2:1-7). So, their prayer is intercessory whether they are asking the ones in heaven to pray for them or whether they are praying to God themselves. Even if they ask God for something for themselves they are interceding. This shows that we can take action in prayer and petition God. The fact that Paul asks us to intercede for others and the fact that there are animated human souls in heaven presents the implication that we may ask those in heaven for prayers just as we ask those on earth to pray for us. This also tells us something of the nature of intercession. We can intercede for one another without taking any of the glory away from the mediation of Christ. This is what Catholics do. When it is said that we pray \"to\" saints this is perhaps a misleading choice of words. In reality, Catholics ask the saints for their prayers so that they may intercede for us. Paul understood this, Catholics understand it.\n \n Peace.",
