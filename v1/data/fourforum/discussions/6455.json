   "Apparently Hampden-Sydney, the school I attend and love is the most anti-homosexual school in the nation at the moment. Here's the list of intolerant schools.\n \n 1. Hampden-Sydney College\n 2. University of Notre Dame\n 3. Baylor University\n 4. Wheaton College (IL)\n 5. Grove City College\n 6. University of Tennessee - Knoxville\n 7. Texas A&M University-College Station\n 8. College of the Holy Cross\n 9. Samford University\n 10. Brigham Young University (UT)\n 11. Seton Hall University\n 12. Valparaiso University\n 13. Pepperdine University\n 14. Washington and Lee University\n 15. Trinity College (CT)\n 16. Vanderbilt University\n 17. Wake Forest University\n 18. University of Utah\n 19. Providence College\n 20. Southern Methodist University\n \n This is embarrassing... I am not gay, and I find it incredibly offensive that so many students of my college who consider themselves well-educated and privileged should be so ignorantly intolerant. This kind of intolerance should not be allowed for any particular group or towards any individual. I understand that everyone is entitled to their own opinion, that is well and good, but where do the bounds between word and verb blur? Must we wait until someone has been physically hurt? The threat of physical violence is not only debasing to the freedoms we hold dear as a society but is an expression of true ignorance and a lack of creativity. No one should feel threatened for what or who they are, be they gay, black, atheist or simply different. People have every right to disagree, but they have no right to threaten physical harm. It seems to me that this is where lines must be drawn. Once that becomes acceptable, or overlooked, the very basic freedoms that we all hold dear come under fire and the comfort of living within such a society becomes a burden. \n Please write to the administration of our school about how you feel and about how you feel this problem might be addressed. It seems to me that the community here is so ignorant of the issue that it will take some outside support to really make a difference.\n \n Thank you for your time and help.\n Here's the address:\n \n Hampden-Sydney College\n Hampden-Sydney, VA 23943",

Because if it's religios by nature, then you've opened a can of worms.\n\n \n So far as I know, we don't necessarily have a mission statement. We aren't really associated with any particular denomination, either. For the most part, the school is secular.\n The only mission statement I can think of is the Hampden-Sydney Honor Code, which is as follows.\n \n \"On my honor I have neither given nor received any aid on this work, nor am I aware of any breach of the Honor Code that I shall not immediately report.\"\n \n Alright, basically what that means is don't lie, cheat, or steal. Those are about the only restrictions put upon the Hampden-Sydney student and they are upheld very strictly. Students get kicked out all the time for plaigerism and lying, but almost never for anything else. Any ideas on that?",

Or do you think those things are acceptable?\n\n \n I am primarily trying to prevent discrimination and violence against gay people and also any other minority within the school's ranks. I don't want to exclude anyone from this effort. However, the gay community is more at issue here, considering we ranked nationally over the issue, which I think will give it some more weight.\n \n Regarding what Bassman was saying, he is right. I will be up against some very serious resistance, and I am still trying to consider the best way of going about this issue. I want to discuss it openly with my fellow students without immediately insulting the majority of them. You see, if I make too many people made too quickly I simply won't get any response whatsoever, which I would consider a loss. However, if I can find a way to approach it that can be discussed openly and yet concisely, that would be ideal. That is largely where I am at a loss. You simply can't go up to guys at this school, say, what do you think about gay rights, and have a normal conversation. So it's a mixture between what both Bassman and jitobear are saying.",

The founding of our country was a triumph of new over old, freedom over restriction, freethinking minds over narrow minds. There is also ways a conservative backlash by those who want to reestablish the old ways, but they have never learned that you cannot turn back the clock. Even their icon George W. Bush, faced with the realities of his policies, is starting to sound more like LBJ than Ronald Reagan. \n \n BTW, that last sentence is going to get some people smoking.\n \n Best of luck.",
