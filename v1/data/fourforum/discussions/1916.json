   "Although my debates are based more on which guy was cooler looking rather than skillful I have several nominies.\n Jimi Hendrix -- I know that I am sounding cliche for saying this, but he was the master. He could make all sorts of beautiful sounds on a guitar.\n Jerry Garcia -- I grew up listening to the Grateful Dead since I was little and naturally love Jerry. He could play fast, skillfully, and I have never heard another guitar sound like his.\n Clapton -- He was a great songwriter but lacked some skills held by the greats.\n Jimmy Page -- Now this in my opinion is the best hard rock guitarist in the history of music. Every time I hear \"Dazed and Confused\" I breath slowly and wonder 'how does he do it?'",

But there is also no question that Adam Clayton is mediocre bass player at best. \n \n Cobian was a great and you can like him all you like - but he will never be remembered for his guitar work. It's doubtful many from the grunge scene will be. They kind of moved away from clever guitar riffs and solos. It wasn't part of the sound. Which is fine. They majorly impacted rock and gave it's multi-dimensionalism another face. But they weren't 'guitar' bands. \n \n I was watching Prince play an acoustic last night on TV - never seen that before. He is amazing. Did I mention Joe Walsh before? Man - I took my mom to the Eagles and alomost fell asleep from all the strumming chords - and then Joe took center stage and blew my mind.
