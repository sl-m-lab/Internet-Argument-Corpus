   ".... It was a reassuring message that Mr. Obama takes seriously his duty to safeguard women's lives and basic rights, including free speech and the choice of whether to bear a child.\n \n The gag rule was first imposed by President Ronald Reagan. It barred any health care provider receiving American family planning assistance from counseling women on abortion, engaging in political speech on abortion or providing abortions, even with its own money.\n \n .... That seriously disrupted the best quality and most accessible family planning services in poor countries. It denied women access to desperately needed contraceptives, help in preventing H.I.V.-AIDS, and maternal care. Mr. Obama's executive order lifting the financing ban will mean fewer deaths from unsafe illegal abortions.\n \n Mr. Obama's stated intention to work with Congress to restore financing to the population fund also is a life-saving step. It ends the sorry exercise by which Mr. Bush repeatedly blocked money approved by Congress to advance poor women's reproductive health, reduce infant mortality, end sexual trafficking and prevent the spread of H.I.V. and AIDS.\n \n To justify this cruelty, the Bush administration perpetuated a bogus charge that the population fund has either stood by or helped with coerced abortions in China.\n\n Very nicely stated in an editorial in today's New York Times:\n http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/24/opinion/24sat3.html\n \n At last.

Frankly your first paragraph exposes the fact that you have no idea what is in our constitution.\n \n There is no \"right to choose\". There never has been, there never will be. It does not appear in the constitition, it does not appear in ANY state or federal law, it does not appear in ANY court ruling. The \"right to choose\" is a sound bite. No more, no less.\n \n What Roe did was prohibit the government from interfering in such a choice on the grounds that there is an implied right to privacy between a woman and her doctor. It was solely a decision that limited the actions of the federal government.\n \n Frankly the argument that you are putting forth, as well as being idiotic, would make a dman fine anti abortion argument. When Bush cut off that federal funding, they argued successfully in court that Roe was based on a perceived right to privacy between a woman and her doctor, but that in requesting that the federal government pay for the abortion, they are voluntarily breaching that privacy. \n \n They court ruled in their favor on that as well as ruling that the government does not have any duty AT ALL to pay for any medical services for anybody. \n \n I dont care about abortion one way or the other. I have advocated killing real, full grown people. I have advocated sticking little arab kids in thermal depolymerization units so we can pour them directly into our gas tanks...though I was half way kidding on that, I still think it might be a good idea for all those killed in Iraq. No sense in wasting all that meat.\n \n I cant decide if you are an extremist or just a fool. Would you argue that the constitution requires that the government pay for a poor woman to have a tooth pulled, or a heart transplant, or is it JUST abortions that we are for some reason you seem unable to explain or provide any precedent for required to pay for??\n \n On edit:\n \n Roe V Wade should be overthrown because it provides a pretty murky legal precedent that can be exploited for virtually anything. The Bush Administration cited Roe V Wade to keep from having to turn over documentation regarding authorization of torture. If you grant that there is a right to privacy between a woman and her doctor as a constitutional principal, it becomes impossible to argue that the same right does not exist between a gun owner and his gun smith, or virtually any other parties engaging in an activity that might be considered private. \n \n It should be overturned and the issue left to the states. I expect that the vase majority of them will immediately pass laws allowing abortion. Some may not. It is called democracy.....",

   "Then you can't decide as much about 65% of your fellow Americans. \n\n \n No...actually most people do not feel that strongly one way or another about abortion. Believe it or not, a lot of us do not care AT ALL. Zealots on both sides seem to believe they are fighting an epic battle, but in truth only about 30% of American voters list in in their top 10 priorities. Nobody give a ####. \n \n Even among people who DO care, the majority of them seem to understand that Roe vs Wade is structurally flawed and is a poor ruling. AS of right now it is the ruling that allows abortion, and also allows US officials to authorize torture and relieves them of the responsibility of answering subpoenas about it. Law of unintended consequences. \n \n \nWell, you lost the election, and there are 3 seats coming up. So get over it. It's called democracy.\n\n \n \n I did not lose anything, and having APPOINTED judges making rulings that quite frankly are nonsense is NOT democracy, it is the absolute OPPOSITE of democracy.\n \n And who says I lost an election??? See, sure mark of a zealot...you see things in black and white...people are either with you, meaning they subscribe to your entire ideology, including the illustratively childish and stupid parts, or they are against you.\n \n Yep...you and George Bush.
