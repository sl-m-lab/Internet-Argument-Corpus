No you don't because the statisitcs are NOT out there.\n\n \n Well, you are talking to Mr. Statistics here so I am quite aware of how few abortions result from women who become pregnant following rape.... the numbers are not hard to find even from the sort of \"official\" unbiased sources many pro-lifers seem so quick to decry.\n \n For example, first hit on Google.\n \n Or if you have the patience to read it, this article.\n \n Now we settled that, you are asserting it is fine to deny the women of South Dakota access to abortion if they are pregnant from a rape just because they are in a minority. I have problems with such an approach.\n \n \nAlso, being raped, has nothing to do with the child, the mother can always give the child up for adoption...ALWAYS. You see killing a child DOES NOT TAKE THE PAIN OF RAPE AWAY. You see that?!!!!\n\n \n I've never been (i) raped and (ii) pregnant so I can't comment on the latter part of your statement first hand but point out that what you say is pure opinion as every person is going to react differently to such a situation. For some it might make a world of difference to not have to bear a child resulting from rape. As to the former I agree, as an advocate of giving the woman the choice between aborting or not.\n \n \nIf a woman is raped, SHE IS A VICTIM, she is imprisoned with the horrific memory the rest of her life, pregnant or not pregnant. If she is pregnant from the rape, and she kills an innocent human being, by abortion, then isn't their the possiblity that this woman has been victimized again, having to endure MORE pyschological pain that the abortion will cause?

Why deny even one woman a choice about her situation just because the liklihood of her condition is statistically low? And saying that she may or may not have further psychological pain isn't so hot a reason either. Give her the facts, give her the statistics, counseling, whatever it takes, and then allow her to make an informed, educated, and intelligent decision. Yes, I agree, if we really gave a hoot about women, especially pregnant ones, we should slowly chip away at the reasons one might get an abortion. But we don't. Not yet at least. \n \n If your morals/religious views/whatever lead you to fight against the legality of women's choice, why not just let the woman who makes her decision deal with her own morality? Why not let the entire weight of her decision lay on her head, and let her deal with it? I can understand the response- well, someone has to speak for the child b/c the child cannot speak for themself. However- it wasn't going to be your kid, you weren't going to have to take care of it- why on Earth do you care? Let the woman care about her own morality/hellfire/etc. Just make sure she's well educated about the possibilities, but don't limit her choices just because of math.

Understand that the pain from rape is a result of being violated - it's not the physical so much - its that you become such an object that your own input, control and safety of being are taken from you.

   "That's simply untrue. A lot of people believe human life begins at later stages. Possible times include birth, viability, development of the brain and development of a separate blood supply.\n\n \n Well, it is True. You ask any geneticist, embryologist, invitro specialist, ask them all, they will tell you when the \"complete\" human being is formed. \n \n As for the implantation part, people believe you cannot sustain life if you don't have the implantation part. So essentially you need both for \"life to exist\" but that is kind of true in modern times, but with technology and the \"alternate womb\" on the horizon, the single-cell human being will have a place to latch onto and develop. For example a crude example at that, we human beings on this planet are \"complete\" human beings and we develop and grow because we are \"implanted\" (by gravity), without being implanted (without gravity) we cannot sustain life, we would die. And that is the rationale with the 4 days to implant as to when life begins. However, unless, modern science can create something that is comparable to gravity or other means where humans can live without gravity. The \"alternate womb\" is the answer for all embryos be that the single-cell and on, can develop. The single cell is the starting point of human LIFE. Please don't confuse LIFE with DEVELOPMENT. Once created (at the single-cell level) we are LIVING HUMAN BEINGS and therefore have life. Every stage after the single-cell is DEVELOPMENT, until our death.\n \n Sure, if you don't want the opinions of the EXPERTS, the people who deal with this everyday, take the opinion of Planned Parenthood, take the opinion of your Teacher, take the opinion of your mother, sister or brother. But if you really want to know the truth, isn't it wise, to look to those who deal with the science everyday. \n \n Unfortunately, people made this issue \"us against them\", and really its too sad, and we refuse to see the science in a neutral manner. I know, people say its not a \"life\" until it has brain waves, etc. Well on the contrary, it has LIFE, life is constant, if one doesn't have life, then life doesnt exist. When an embryo DEVELOPS it sustains LIFE THROUGHOUT, but is forever DEVELOPING. Like you and I, we are always \"developing\" as in aging, and the \"life\" we had at 10 years of ages is the same life we have at 30, 40, 50. LIFE is always constant. From day one, the single-cell up until this very day of our life has been constant. Please don't be distracted by those with PhDs and MDs that don't deal with the single cell embryo/zygote. People in this field of expertise, can help a mom conceive, and you think these people don't know when they created life? Well, they do know when they created life, and down the road, they will know how to sustain the life of a single-cell human with an \"artificial womb\". \n \n This knowledge is out there, but the political pro-choicers are trying to deny this information, trying to put a spin on it, denouncing it, etc. Hey, we can help women become pregnant with science, we can CLONE for god sake, but none of these EXPERTS, know when they have created LIFE.

How BIZARRE IS THAT!! They are just too damn lucky I guess.\n\n \n I agree with everything you said about it being a life. I don't buy into anything that says that it's not human nor alive. It's certainly a functioning organism that if allowed to develop will grow into a completely recognizable baby. I agree; we all are in certain stages of development, and a child is not less a human than an adult. A fetus, while not fully formed, is no less human than an adult. It's just in development. A kid pre-puberty is different developmentally than an adult, but we don't think of them as less than human.\n \n The difference between us is that I know it's none of my business what the woman chooses. I am not more qualified than you, than a genetist, than a fertility expert, etc. in telling a woman what her morality and decision should be. If you have a moral problem with it, then why not just allow the woman to deal with it herself? If she is fully informed about her decision, and I mean scientifically-give her the facts, the statistics, counseling, whatever, and then allow her to decide. I think you said in a post awhile back that education is empowerment. I agree, and would add that choice is empowerment. Allow her to choose her own path of morality. Isn't morality better explored and felt than forced? What would someone learn if they didn't have to expand their horizons, if the hard decisions were just made for them?\n \n Does that make any sense, or do I need another cup of coffee?",

   "http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/12/opinion/12sun1.html\n \n March 12, 2006\n Editorial\n A Warning From South Dakota \n When President Bush's Supreme Court nominees were asked about abortion and Roe v. Wade, their answers ranged from vague to opaque. But the state legislature in South Dakota felt it heard the underlying message loud and clear. Now, South Dakota has thrown down the gauntlet. It adopted a law last week that makes every abortion that is not necessary to save the life of the mother a crime. The law is clearly unconstitutional under existing Supreme Court rulings. But its backers are hoping that the addition of John Roberts and Samuel Alito to the court will be enough to change things.\n \n The law should be struck down because it imposes an unacceptable burden on women. But it should also serve as a warning that the threat to abortion rights has reached a new level.\n \n South Dakota's abortion law is the most restrictive one adopted by any state since Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973. It does not contain exceptions for pregnancies that result from rape or from incest. Nor does it allow abortions that are necessary to preserve the health of the mother. The law is unlikely to go into force anytime soon. If it did, it would simply drive women - as in the pre-Roe days - to risk their lives to end their pregnancies with illegal back-alley abortions.\n \n Gov. Mike Rounds, who signed the bill into law, said that the \"true test of a civilization\" was how it treated \"the most vulnerable and helpless,\" including \"unborn children.\" But his state has hardly been a leader in protecting vulnerable children who have left the womb. The nation's three worst counties for child poverty at the time of the last census were all in South Dakota, according to the Children's Defense Fund. Buffalo County, home to the Crow Creek Indian Reservation, was dead last.\n \n South Dakota's law defies Supreme Court precedents, which hold that states cannot put an \"undue burden\" on abortion rights and cannot ban abortions necessary to preserve the mother's health. But anti-abortion forces seem eager to see how firm those precedents will be with Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito changing the balance. \n \n The test seems premature, since even if both men voted to overturn Roe there would still only be four votes. Justice Anthony Kennedy, a moderate conservative, has sided with the court's four liberals on this point. But abortion opponents may be hoping he can be pressured to change. They have also begun predicting that Justice John Paul Stevens, the oldest member, will leave the court, allowing President Bush to appoint another anti-Roe justice.\n \n Whatever the fate of the South Dakota law, it seems likely to jump-start a whole new era of abortion battles. More states may soon follow South Dakota's lead, and if the membership of the Supreme Court changes, abortion may become illegal in much or even all of the country. Roe ushered in three decades of complacency for the majority of Americans who support abortion rights. South Dakota's harsh new law is a clear sign that the time for complacency is over.",
