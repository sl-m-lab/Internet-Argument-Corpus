   "So we might be moving on to banking reform in the near future and I read an Op-Ed by Krugman...again....which brought up two different camps as explained below:\n Op-Ed Columnist - Financial Reform 101 - NYTimes.com\n \nEven among those who really do want reform, however, there's a major debate about what's really essential. One side - exemplified by Paul Volcker, the redoubtable former Federal Reserve chairman - sees limiting the size and scope of the biggest banks as the core issue in reform. The other side - a group that includes yours truly - disagrees, and argues that the important thing is to regulate what banks do, not how big they get.\n\n \n I've color coded the two arguments since some of you are a little dense...then again since Daewoo is likely the only one to read this (damn you Georged!) with some thought it probably didn't make a difference.

So I'm confused how you don't put those guys outta business while still regulating Citi Bank\n\n \n Jp may still show up.\n \n The thing is, if the regulation is proper and decent, it should not impact them at all. For example, a regulation requiring that SIVs be kept on the books woudl not impact the local bank at all. Likewise a regulation that says you cannot package and sell bonds as AAA paper while making side bets that they will fail is not going to impact banks with 3-4 branches that are doing business in good faith.\n \n What may well impact smaller banks is the (completely justified) moves that FASB seems to be making to force banks to mark loans to market as opposed to marking them to imagination. They (FASB) need to also go back and undo the damage done last year when congress basically browbeat them into lightening up on mark to market rules for the banks bond holdings. I honest to god could not believe it when I saw congress screeching about mark to market because it was making the banks look insolvent when, in fact, they were insolvent. And the american public lapped it up. People kept saying \"they would not be in trouble except for the GUBERMENTS accounting rules\". Yea...then why did we have to give them a trillion dollars????? \n \n That is one place where good, local banks may take a hit. I know the little local bank here does not mark their loans anywhere near market because their default rate is less than 1%. There are only like 3000 people in the entire county. They literally know every person they loan money to personally. \n \n Frankly, though, as long as we are going to let these mega banks exist, the smaller guys should get used to getting screwed. A lot of the smaller banks could have played the same games that the big boys did. They chose not to, in many cases because it was unethical as hell, but when the big correction came...when those who took insane risks and engaged in ethics free business finally were going to get their come uppins, and the smaller guys who behaved responsibly and ethically should have seen their behavior rewarded, what happened? We not only gave the big guys a trillion dollars, we sent the message that getting away from the responsible local lenders was the way to go because if you were with the big guys no matter what, uncle moneybags would take care of you.",

FASB has been on a FMV frenzy the last decade (even more so with IASB making the rules everywhere else...its going to be like metric system all over again) wanting everything to be basically \"marked to market\".

The thing about valuation methods is they all turn out the same way in the long run. FIFO vs LIFO ends up the same. You don't hear people going \"man, I'd sell a lot more widgets if I had just used FIFO instead\". No, doesn't happen. Same thing with mark-to-market, and you are right, it didn't change the fact that they had worthless investments. NO ONE complained when it made their investments insanely high and probably overvalued. Like everything in the US, people want the rules changed as soon as they are in trouble by the very rule they wanted implemented.

I am not even entirely sure if it matters what method you use as long as it is consistent and people actually stick to it as opposed to using loopholes to claim that MBS paper, which is traded millions of times a day, is impossible to provide a market value for, so we are going to invent a model that is nonsesical to come up with a number that justifies our bonus. \n \n IMO the big problem is that if they require banks to mark loans to market you end up with an unfair situation for the smaller banks who typically hold the loans they make to maturity and who often lend based on direct knowledge of the person they are lending to rather than just their credit score. I can just about promise you, though, that if they make an exemption for small banks, citibank will claim to be a small bank. \n \n \nOr in short, the small banks picked up part of the tab while the big guys profited.

Well I'm not even sure this would matter. Not like the Fed wouldn't just get the rules changed to make them in compliance. The person that sets the rules tends to never break them for that very reason.\n \n \nAnd yet the bucket is still empty. I dont understand........\nAh!
