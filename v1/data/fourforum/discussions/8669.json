   "Jewish lobbyists begin in USA and NATO finishes it up in the fields. As old as the hills. This time they made a Big Stir in the Middle East sorting it out with Hezbollah. The same sort of thing they previously did in Afghanistan and Iran and other places. Now what? Jews are grumbling they are helpless in fighting Hezbollah. They have no modern armaments due to careless Americans. They haven't enough cannon fodder as well. \n But luckily NATO has plenty of both as usually. This means NATO has to meddle and help Israel once again. This could provoke a long enough war... And again Europeans and Americans will have to die 'cause loony Jews are obsessed with the crazy idea of having an upper hand in their rivalry with the Islamic world.\n Well if it was a sophisticated American plan to employ Israel to achieve American goals in the region, then this plan has been failed by wily Jews. I am almost sure that powerful Jewish lobby in Washington D.C. prompted that damned plan. They calculated everything at the very beginning.",

   "I don't know if the people of Israel actually need NATO for military help. Israel is rolling on the Hezbollah. Hezbollah is putting up resistance but Israel is acting with disproportionate retaliation, which I believe is a good policy. They have quite a modern military but also have quite a powerful lobby here in the US. The help Israel needs is negotiating a peace in the region.",

   "The problem with this is that Israel has essentially not met any of their objectives, but Hezbollah counter strikes are increasing in both intensity and sophistication. \n \n To crush Hezbollah, Israel needed to get in there and get the job done before Hezbollah could get supply lines in place for replacement equipment. They failed miserably at this. \n \n Israels claims this this was all Hizbollahs fault did not hold up nearly as well as they had hoped. Within a couple weeks of the attacks their argument had been picked apart and refused by the international community and the people of Lebanon. Support for hezbollah is up (significantly by most accounts) and the Israeli military, rather than looking like a crack force of professionals, is looking decidedly amateurish. \n \n Now Israel has figured out that they have bitten off far more than they can chew, and there is no way to salvage their operation, so they are \"allowing\" a cease fire to be negotiated.",
