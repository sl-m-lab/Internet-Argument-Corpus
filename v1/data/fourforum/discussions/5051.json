Otherwise I must consider you unintelligent.\n If information does not have a purpose that means it is irrelevant.\n Evolutionists think they need to explain to me what a rainbow is but I constantly having to introduce them to the dictionary.\n \n pur\u00b7pose ( P ) Pronunciation Key (p\u00fbrps)\n n. \n The object toward which one strives or for which something exists; an aim or a goal: \"And ever those, who would enjoyment gain/Must find it in the purpose they pursue\" (Sarah Josepha Hale). \n A result or effect that is intended or desired; an intention.

The complicated bit lies in the chemical properties of enzymes - this is why we can't just write organisms. I have designed functional DNA sequences whilst still an undergraduate at university, its really easy.\n \n Anyway - there have been arteficial proteins designed purely at random using evolutionary models (i.e selection for a characteristic) that have had no mind involved in designing them. At the time the experimenter did not know what sequences of amino acid were needed to produce the wanted effect and did not know the sequences at any point until they were eventually sequenced at the very end of the experiment.\n \n The code has written itself here, I'm sure someone more familiar with the computing side of sceince can mention some of the self writing codes as well.\n A desk top publisher has been written largely using thse kinds of methods (mentioned in the book emergance, but don't have it with me sadly)",

Same principle. Random acts can produce results which are indestinguishable from purposeful acts.\n \n No that theory was put to the test and it would not happen in a billion billion years \n Long ago and far far away is a fairy tale.\n Huxley (1887-1975) said that, given enough time, monkeys typing randomly could eventually type out the complete works of Shakespeare. \n \n Since then, others too, such as Stephen Hawking and Richard Dawkins, have made similar pronouncements about monkeys' random typing being able to produce one of Shakespeare's sonnets, or at least a sentence from one of his plays. \n \n But when Plymouth University (UK) researchers installed a keyboard and computer screen in the monkey enclosure at Paignton Zoo, home to six Sulawesi crested macaques, it didn't result in a nicely typed set of the complete works of Shakespeare. Neither did they get a sonnet. Nor even a single word of Shakespeare. \n \n No, when the researchers gave six monkeys one computer for a month, what they got was ... a mess.\n \n The first thing the lead male did was to find a stone and start bashing the computer with it. Subsequently, the younger ones came and pressed some of the keys. But most of the macaques' time was spent sitting or jumping on the computer, or using it as a toilet. (The computer was protected by a transparent plastic covering in such a way that the monkeys could nevertheless hit the keys with their fingers.) After one month, the monkeys had produced five pages of text, composed primarily of the letter 'S'. But there was not a single recognizable word in sight. The letter 'A' was the only vowel to be used, and it did not make an appearance until page 4.\n \n Despite the outcome being gobbledegook, the combined efforts of monkeys Elmo, Gum, Heather, Holly, Mistletoe and Rowan have been made available for sale in a limited edition book, bound in the style of a Shakespearean play, entitled Notes Towards the Complete Works of Shakespeare\n \n According to the science correspondent of Britain's Guardian newspaper, \"assuming each monkey typed a steady 120 characters a minute (itself a preposterous assumption), mathematicians have calculated it would take 10 to the 813th power (10 followed by 813 zeros) monkeys about five years to knock out a decent version of Shakespeare's Sonnet 3\" \n \n \n \n \n \n I think I see why you don't get this. You picture DNA as a set of instructions on how to build an organism, don't you? And a mutation as being the scrambling of some letters or words in those instructions (this is of course an analogy) When you scramble the words in a sentence the sentence becomes gibberish, and information is lost. That's roughly your image here, isn't it?\n \nIt's called reality\n\n The only information contained in DNA is a code for sequencing amino acids. That's it. A gene contains the information needed to order the amino acids to make a protien. What happens if you change the gene, if you mutate it? You get a different protein. No net information is lost. It's possible for a mutation to result in the creation of a new protien without loss of the ability to create any of the old protiens. That's clearly an increase in information. A mutation my result in the creation of a protein which can react with other chemicals in a cell to build structure of much greater complexity than previously. \n \nThat's an incredible assumption . My brother is a neurologist and his best friend is a molecular biologist. They think we have much to learn about DNA and our present grasp is tiny. We really don't know what we will discover about biological information systems. I don't think many biologist would make a statement like that.\n That is flawed reasoning that mutations create new information. They just damage existing information. The decades of experiments on fruit flies showed this to be true. They came up with all sorts of weird fruit flies but they were still fruit flies. Observational evidence is the most persuasive.\n Your idea is contrary to observation and is pure imagination.\n\n \n \n \n All that DNA does it code for the building blocks. The \"information\" needed to turn those building blocks into an organism are contained within chemistry. If you give a carpenter pine boards instead of oak, he can still build a table, because the information on how to build a table resides in him, not in the boards. It'll just be a different table. Give chemistry different proteins and it'll make a different organism, because the information on how to build a cell comes from chemistry, not from DNA. All DNA does is say which boards get used.[QUOTE]\n Again you are going way out with your assumption that we know all there is to know and all our present data is properly interpreted.\n Look at the fruit fly -3000 mutation and not one improved fruit fly and no evidence of anything but a fruit fly .\n Long ago and far far away is not an argument it is a fairy tale.\n Your description of what we know about the function of dna is correct. A better analogy of what a mutation does would be an electrical surge damaging the computer program a builder used.\n He might end up with a house with 14 doors and one window but he would would not end up with car.",

   "Wow, someone gets defensive when they are proved wrong.\n\n I apologize for being a bit testy but when 95% of the people you talk to think you so stupid you are unaware that water runs down hill you get a bit frustrated.As far as proving me wrong that is unimportant but you have not proved information theory to be wrong just that I am not that good at explaining it. You do however have a valid point.\n\n The fact is, if information must be created and transmitted by a mind, if that si the definition of information, we have no reason to believe DNA contains \"information\".\n\n That is a good point. The answer is that there are some things we do not understand and may never understand. No one would consider a bee to have a mind in the human sense but they do have a form of intelligence. A bee \"knows\" what to eat and can transmit that information to other bees that receive and understand the bees code. \n I assume you as most people see this as instinct which is a perfect example to me of accepting something you have no understanding of on faith. No one on this planet has any idea how bees \"know\" this and no one knows how butterflies know where to migrate to. Evolution is not a possible answer. How could a butterfly pass on knowledge to it's young when it never lives to see them born? We know it happens that is all.\n In the same light human beings \"read\" the biotic code. If I could tell you how they do that I would win the Nobel Prize and my name would go down in History with Newton , Kelvin ,and Pasteur. I do not think that is terribly likely. :) \n Never the less human beings , animals , and plants \"read\" the genetic code.\n Because there is no code that has ever created itself it is a scientific law that codes must be created by an intelligent mind. This is observable evidence. If 90% of the evidence points in one direction the 10% that conflicts with it is disgarded unless new evidence is found. That is the true quantification of a solid scientific theory.\n A theory becomes law when it is universally valid , repeatably testable , and has never been refuted.\n There are laws of gravity although gravity is a theory. Heavier than air objects allways fall to earth unless an outside force resists . That is a scientific law or a law of nature. The theory of gravity deals with such things as how planets interact etc. It is a very strong theory but not a law.\n Also we really don't know what gravity is although we have some very good observational evidence of it's effects.\n We do not know how living things receive the genetic code only that they do .That is law. No known living thing thing is capable of creating the biotic code so an unknown entity must have. It took us many milenia just to discover it.\n \n \n\n \n So we can use your definition of the word, it just means we have to call the coding sequences in DNA something other than \"information\".\n\n And what would that be? Random chemical oddities without purpose?\n It is information, I cannot think of a logical reason one would deny that, only a religious one.\n \n\n Less viable at what?\n \n New mutations in a species which has already evolved for millions of years in a particular environment will almost always be detrimental in that environment.\n \n However, put them in a novel environment and what was previously unviable becomes viable, and what was previously viable becomes unviable.\n \n And in any case, what does that have to do with \"new information\" being impossible? You lose one creationist argument, and then shift to another one.\n\n Less viable than a fruit fly in nature. Have you actually ever read the results of those experiments? No macroevolution was observed and not one single beneficial mutation was observed. Allmost none of the mutated flies could survive outside the lab. A fruit fly with 4 wings is bird food, it cannot fly!\n There are some very rare cases where mutations occured that benefited the organism but not one in all the years of this experiment. Show me one.\n \n Please be serious. In what enviornment would a leg sticking out of your back or 6 extra eyes that don't function be beneficial?\n Your reasoning is circular. We find fruit flies in amber said to be millions of years old that are just like modern ones. None of them have 4 wings and 6 eyes. \n What does millions of years do to help a fly who was eaten shortly after it's birth?\n Ignoring observable evidence in favor of what you want to hear is living the fairy tale not just believing it.\n \n There was no new information created as that would violate the scientific law that matter cannot create information. The whole point of the experiment was to provide observable evidence of a new type of insect evolving. It proved that was impossible.\n We already new mutations exist.\n \n The fact that you refuse to be confused by the facts does not constitue winning an argument.",

A fly with four wings cannot fly at all. The fruit fly experiment was a complete failure.\n \n\n You have either been misinformed, or you simply didn't understand what these experiments were doing. Not all mutated flies are less viable. That is simply not true. For example, there have been experiments where mutations were induced which made the flies more sexually attractive (to other flies). The mutated flies had a greater success rate when it came to breeding than non-mutated flies. They were more viable. Your assertion that all mutations lead to less viable offspring is simple wrong, and this has been demonstrated extensively in the lab. You are taking specific cases where mutations did lead to a less viable fly, and applying that to all mutations. You are incorrect to do so.\n \n \n\n The idea was due to the fact that fruit flies reproduce in a short time the study of the effect of mutations would prove macroevolution. The results were just the opposite. Anyone who breeds dogs will tell you the farther you get from the original brown dog you get the less viable the critter becomes. \n \n\n I don't believe that anyone has ever tried to breed/mutate fruit flies to a degree that would demonstrate macro-evolution. I think you are wrong about that. Please provide any evidence that this has taken place. And what you're saying about dog breeding is wrong too. It's not distance from the proto-dog that causes loss of viability, it's inbreeding. If you breed a line too closely in an attempt to emphasize certain traits you increase the risk of have recessive genes become common, and depending on the gene that can cause problems. It's the same problem you get from marrying your cousin. A breed that hasn't been overbred is just as viable as the wolf stock from which they came. Proof? There are dog breeds that have been about for thousands of years. If they weren't viable, they would still be here.\n \n \n Your agruments here all center around your assertion that all mutations lead to a loss of viability. That assertion is wrong. Some do, yes.

There are pre-mating mechanisms--behavioral, ecological, and physical differences that make it difficult for two species to mate. If that line of defense fails, second-line, post-mating mechanisms ensure that the progeny of the barrier-crashers are either rendered sterile (like mules) or they die before reaching maturity.\" \n \n \"The rescue gene turned out to be strange indeed. While it weakened the general health of the flies that carried it, it gave life to their hybrid progeny. However, the gene didn't completely break through the species barrier; it couldn't render the males fertile. 'The flies live,' says Hutter, 'but they're sterile.' Which raises a troublesome question: If the parents that carry it don't benefit from it, and offspring that inherit it can't pass it on, how could the gene possibly have evolved?\" \n \n \n \n \n \n\n I don't believe that anyone has ever tried to breed/mutate fruit flies to a degree that would demonstrate macro-evolution. I think you are wrong about that. Please provide any evidence that this has taken place. And what you're saying about dog breeding is wrong too. It's not distance from the proto-dog that causes loss of viability, it's inbreeding. If you breed a line too closely in an attempt to emphasize certain traits you increase the risk of have recessive genes become common, and depending on the gene that can cause problems. It's the same problem you get from marrying your cousin. A breed that hasn't been overbred is just as viable as the wolf stock from which they came. Proof? There are dog breeds that have been about for thousands of years. If they weren't viable, they would still be \n\n The account of evolution given above is based on molecular and historical \n evidence and on our knowledge of the living world as it is today. Many \n events were postulated without direct evidence. Because of the lack of \n hard evidence, it might be said that the concept of evolution is abstract, \n theoretical, possibly a figment of the imagination. The question therefore \n arises: can we reproduce evolution in the laboratory? Obviously, we cannot \n do so using long-extinct creatures or large present-day animals. Because \n evolutionary events take place over many generations, it would take \n centuries to experiment with mice, say. But we *can* design an experiment \n using fast-reproducing organisms like bacteria or fruitflies.\" (Dulbecco R., \n \"The Design of Life,\" Yale University Press: New Haven CT, 1987, p.439. \n Emphasis in original)\n \n http://nobelprize.org/medicine/laureates/1933/morgan-bio.html\n That is nonsense.

   "Ok, I might a little late in this, but,\n \n It has been asserted somewhere here that it takes an intelligent mind to records, store, and transmit information. Here are some examples in which that is not true.\n \n 1) Trees\n \n The secondary phylum in most trees form rings around the center as the tree ages. The thickness of each ring is dependent on the rainfall each year. Therefore, not only do the rings store information on the age of the tree, they also store information as to the amount of rainfall.\n \n So, trees (no intelligent mind) record and store information in their rings.\n \n 2) Bacterial Conjugation\n \n Most people know that bacteria reproduce via binary fission. However, many bacteria have a special trick that gives them genetic variability. It is called conjugation. Bacteria which possess the F plasmid have the ability to form a sex pilus with other bacteria. The bacteria then uses this sex pilus to send genetic code to the recieving bacteria. Many times, a sex pilus is formed to send a copy of the F plasmid across. Other times, an R plasmid (genetic code for antibacterial resistance) is sent.\n \n So, bacteria (no intelligent mind) send information (since many have the notion that DNA and genetic material is \"information\") to other bacteria on how to form sex pili and protect themselves from antibacterial agents.\n \n 3) Bacteriophages\n \n Bacteriophages are viruses that attack bacteria. What's more, they are non-living. So, bacteriophages have no way of reproducing. So, in order to replicate, viruses attach themselves to bacteria and inject their DNA (information). This DNA get's incorporated into the bacteria's DNA, causing the bacteria to produce more bacteriophages.\n \n So, bacteriophages (no intelligent mind. in fact, inanimate) send information on how to produce more of themselves forcefully on to host bacteria.\n \n \n There you have it. Three example off the top of my head where transformation is sent by non-intelligent things, and one example where it is sent by an inanimate thing. What more do you want?",

It is obvious that dogs and wolves can interbreed but is the dog the decendant of the wolf? I believe that is the case.

Expecting a fly to turn into a bee in nonsense unless you are willing to wait a few million generations.\n \n As for wolves and dogs, through in coyotes and foxs and it gets far more complicated - simplified, wolves can breed with most dogs, and most dogs can breed with red coyotes (think its them). However there are dogs that could breed with each other and with a wolf or coyote, but not both.\n Same with black backed gulls and herring gulls as you track populations around the northern hemisphere. In Europe they are two completely different species - but as you go to the opposite side of the world they are able to interbreed there.\n \n If you can have something happening like this, why is it so hard to imagine the same thing happens over time. 'Dogs' several millions of years ago could not breed with todays dogs even though every generation would have been able to breed with the ones next to it over the timespan. The do the same thing with the original 'dog' we started with and go back further - the little changes that merely change colour and slight proportions (as in the case of the gulls) suddenly start making our ancestor dog look significantly different from todays dog.\n \n The reason species can't usually interbreed is that there is too much difference in the DNA. Given that we are happy that DNA mutates over time, eventually the differences become enough that two populations who could breed, no longer can. Same as our ancestor dogs, or the seagulls through time rather than space.\n \n I think an important thing that few creationists realise that its this inability to breed which comes first. Once our organisms can no longer naturally breed (say they have been seperated), then the physical changes can start accumulating.

   "Ok, I might a little late in this, but,\n \n It has been asserted somewhere here that it takes an intelligent mind to records, store, and transmit information. Here are some examples in which that is not true.\n \n 1) Trees\n \n The secondary phylum in most trees form rings around the center as the tree ages. The thickness of each ring is dependent on the rainfall each year. Therefore, not only do the rings store information on the age of the tree, they also store information as to the amount of rainfall.\n \n So, trees (no intelligent mind) record and store information in their rings.\n\n Please read the definition of information. This is no different from water stains on a bridge support. It indicates how high the water was at one time. If you observe that it becomes your knowledge. If you transfer the knowledge to me in a code we both understand and agree on, English for instance, it would then become information about the high water mark. The high water mark is not in itself information.\n Information in a non material entity.\n \n \n\n 2) Bacterial Conjugation\n \n Most people know that bacteria reproduce via binary fission. However, many bacteria have a special trick that gives them genetic variability. It is called conjugation. Bacteria which possess the F plasmid have the ability to form a sex pilus with other bacteria. The bacteria then uses this sex pilus to send genetic code to the recieving bacteria. Many times, a sex pilus is formed to send a copy of the F plasmid across. Other times, an R plasmid (genetic code for antibacterial resistance) is sent.\n \n So, bacteria (no intelligent mind) send information (since many have the notion that DNA and genetic material is \"information\") to other bacteria on how to form sex pili and protect themselves from antibacterial agents.\n \nBees transfer information and they do not have a mind in a human sense but they \"know\" how to tell the other bees where to find nectar. This is a transfer of a non material entity in a mutually understood code by two intelligent beings. The message also has a purpose therefore it is information.\n Dna is not information it is the media for the information transfer. Information is a non material entity , there are no exceptions.\n \n3) Bacteriophages\n \n Bacteriophages are viruses that attack bacteria. What's more, they are non-living. So, bacteriophages have no way of reproducing. So, in order to replicate, viruses attach themselves to bacteria and inject their DNA (information). This DNA get's incorporated into the bacteria's DNA, causing the bacteria to produce more bacteriophages.\n \n So, bacteriophages (no intelligent mind. in fact, inanimate) send information on how to produce more of themselves forcefully on to host bacteria.\n \n \n There you have it. Three example off the top of my head where transformation is sent by non-intelligent things, and one example where it is sent by an inanimate thing. What more do you want?\n\n See above.",

The bridge has no more idea that there was a flood than the tree knows how old it is.\n\n But i disagree. Who are you to say that trees do not know how old they are? You agree that bees and even bacteria are intelligent in some way that we don't. I claim the same for trees. They are knowledgeable in some way we don't understand. However, they are not intelligent, but they knowingly store information in their trees.\n \n \nThey are intelligent in some way we just don't really understand how yet. A bee transfers fer information to other bees and we have know idea how that happens either. The observable evidence is that information is transferred in a manner they both understand.\n\n Bacteria intelligent? Now THAT's a stretch. They have no anatomy that even suggest intelligence. Nothing that suggests any competence what-so-ever. They are purely releaser-stimulus organisms. However, they still knowingly transfer information using DNA as a medium.\n \n And you forgot my example of viruses. They are inanimate, yet they transfer information using DNA as the medium to bacteria. How do you account for this?\n \n \nTo come to strong conclusions one must have strong definitions.\n\n I agree. However, there has not been a single strong definition presented.\n \n Let me present some definitions:\n \n Definition.com:\n \n Information:\n 1)Knowledge derived from study, experience, or instruction. \n 2)Knowledge of specific events or situations that has been gathered or received by communication; intelligence or news. See Synonyms at knowledge. \n 3)A collection of facts or data: statistical information. \n 4)The act of informing or the condition of being informed; communication of knowledge: Safety instructions are provided for the information of our passengers. \n 5)Computer Science. Processed, stored, or transmitted data. \n 6)A numerical measure of the uncertainty of an experimental outcome. \n 7)Law. A formal accusation of a crime made by a public officer rather than by grand jury indictment. \n \n Merriam-Webster.com:\n \n Information:\n 1 : the communication or reception of knowledge or intelligence\n 2 a (1) : knowledge obtained from investigation, study, or instruction (2) : INTELLIGENCE, NEWS (3) : FACTS, DATA b : the attribute inherent in and communicated by one of two or more alternative sequences or arrangements of something (as nucleotides in DNA or binary digits in a computer program) that produce specific effects c (1) : a signal or character (as in a communication system or computer) representing data (2) : something (as a message, experimental data, or a picture) which justifies change in a construct (as a plan or theory) that represents physical or mental experience or another construct d : a quantitative measure of the content of information; specifically : a numerical quantity that measures the uncertainty in the outcome of an experiment to be performed\n 3 : the act of informing against a person\n 4 : a formal accusation of a crime made by a prosecuting officer as distinguished from an indictment presented by a grand jury\n \n There, some viable definitions.\n \n \nFor example:\n Insanity\n Something that is extremely foolish. \n If you take that sentence to define insanity you could lock people away for falling in love with the wrong person for them. We all do extremely foolish things at some point in our lives. \n\n Yes, you can label someone insane for doing something extremely foolish. However, to lock somebody up, only a psychological definition is used in court and decided upon by a jury. \n \n Show me a different example.\n \n \nIf you use a strong definition it will not happen.\n\n I agree, but there has been no strong definition presented.\n \n \nPersistent mental disorder or derangement. No longer in scientific use. \n Law. \n Unsoundness of mind sufficient in the judgment of a civil court to render a person unfit to maintain a contractual or other legal relationship or to warrant commitment to a mental health facility. \n In most criminal jurisdictions, a degree of mental malfunctioning sufficient to relieve the accused of legal responsibility for the act committed. \n\n \n Ok, and this is the only definition applicable in court. By the way, wherefrom are you getting these definitions? A source would be helpful.\n \n \nExtreme foolishness; folly. \n Something that is extremely foolish. \n Synonyms: insanity, lunacy, madness, mania, dementia\n\n err...I don't see a point to this.\n \n \nIf that is the case it is not the biotic code. I disagree.\n\n Fine, but your definition of the \"biotic code\" does not exist. What does exist is a series of atoms that react to gain a more stable electron configuration. Show me otherwise, and I'll grant you your point.\n \n \nChange and creation is not the same thing. If I get a virus the code in my computer may change but new information is not created. In almost all instances this is not beneficial.\n Create\n To cause to exist; bring into being. \n To give rise to; produce: That remark created a stir. \n To invest with an office or title; appoint. \n To produce through artistic or imaginative effort: create a poem; create a role. \n\n \n The way DNA \"creates\" things is through transcription and translation. First, DNA is converted into mRNA. mRNA then leaves the nucleus and travels to the rRNA ribosomes, where tRNA (anti-codons) group with the condons on the mRNA and deposit an amino acid. A combination of amino acids creates a protein.\n \n So, if you look back to the many types of mutations I presented, any insertion of a nulceotide would \"bring into being\" another amino acid. It would \"cause to exist\" another peptide in the polypeptide. It would \"give rise to; produce\" a new amino acid on the protein. As you can see, mutations fit the first two definitions you presented of create. The second two are not applicable to science in any way.\n \n \nThere are neutral mutations and in some very rare cases mutations that benefit the organism. It requires new information to grow feathers on a reptile or any creature that did not have them before. That is impossible because matter cannot create non-material entities like information.\n\n \n First, prove to me why information must be non-material. I gave you two definitions from reputable dictionaries that BOTH have no mention of \"non-material\" being an inherent characteristic of information. Show me one dictionary that does, and I'll give your definition some credence.\n \n Second, you are matter. I hope you know this. You create information all the time. I'm sure you believe this too.

Thus, organism C is identical to organism A, and yet it is the result of two decreases in information. How can this be?\n \nInformation is a non-material entity. A mutation is a material entity and is therefore not information. If I pee into my computer it will damage the code, not do anything , or kill the computer.\n The same thing with a mutation to the genetic code. For instance a mutation in the homeobox gene might turn a viable 2 winged fruitfly into a 4 winged treat for a sparrow. It will not however turn the fruitfly into butterfly. That would require new information not just a scrambling of old information as in your example\n The whole point of this is you are trying to claim that the information to create new and completely different types of creatures like growing feathers on a lizard is possible with no new information just by damaging old information and natural selection weeding out the beneficial traits that occur.\n This is nonsense as beneficial mutations are Extremely rare and are unguided. How would mutations account for all the changes necessary to turn a dinosaur into a bird for example? When any of the changes by themselves would insure their extinction by natural selection.\n An avian lung is completely different that a dinosaur lung. Nothing in between could support life for more than 4 minutes.\n It;s a very silly senario.\n There is no way to account for this , it is a fairy tale not science.",

   "These don't refer at all to the mechanism of creation.\n They don't say that God created man and woman instantaneously.\n They do not preclude evolution.\n\n the scripture shows that jesus was a creationist. \"have you not read...\" there was nowhere for jews to read about where God created man and woman except in genesis. jesus' statement shows that he is referring to the genesis creation story, the only story accepted by jews that talked about God creating man and woman. elsewhere jesus also referred to the murder of abel by his brother, another genesis/creationist trademark\n \n clearly, jesus was of creationist persuasion. he took the genesis story as true, and preached from the basis that it was true. even though jesus' specific sentence does not outline the creationist story, it refers to genesis, which does",
