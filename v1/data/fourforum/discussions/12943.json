   "asahi.com????????Unloaded rifle on TV triggers controversy - English\n \n OTSU, Shiga Prefecture--Given this nation's strict gun control law, were police overreacting when they swooped on a TV broadcaster that had allowed a celebrity to handle a hunting rifle during a live broadcast?\n \n The Shiga prefectural police insist they were perfectly within their rights, but TV networks are outraged, citing the fact the weapon was not loaded.\n \n The incident stems from a show aired Jan. 17 by Biwako Broadcasting Co. Almost four months later, police mounted a search of the premises and confiscated a dozen items, including a script and a DVD of the show.\n \n Critics accuse the police of being overzealous and question their motives, but law enforcement officials remain unrepentant.\n \n Shiga prefectural police regard the incident, in which a hunter with a gun permit allowed TV personality Noburo Harada, 57, to momentarily handle the rifle during the show, as a serious breach of a law concerning the storage and management of firearms.\n \n So much so, in fact, that on June 12, the prefectural police referred the case to prosecutors. As a result, the hunter, aged 49, along with a 60-year-old TV producer and a 37-year-old director of the show, could face charges of violating the swords and firearms control law.\n \n Police did not pursue a case against Harada even though he briefly handled the weapon. Police argued that he did not actually \"possess\" the rifle because the hunter handed it to him in an unscripted moment during the broadcast.\n \n Police justified their search on grounds that they needed to determine if the law concerning the storage and management of firearms had been broken.\n \n The show, called \"Tokimeki Shiga'S,\" is broadcast one Saturday a month. In the show, Harada visits various locations in the prefecture as a travel guide.\n \n The program in question was set in Yogo, where Harada and other cast members were served a pot of wild boar meat. The hunter who had killed the boar appeared in the scene. He offered the unloaded weapon to Harada and asked,\"Do you want to hold it?\"\n \n Harada held the rifle and commented, \"It's heavy, isn't it?\" adding, \"Not everybody has a chance to hold it, right?\"\n \n He held the firearm for six seconds and then gave it back.\n \n Biwako Broadcasting says the scene in which the hunter handed over the rifle was not in the script and was improvised.\n \n The TV crew decided to display the rifle on the show after the hunter told the director he had no problem with the idea at a preliminary meeting.\n \n The prefectural police began their investigation after a complaint by a viewer.\n \n The intervention by the police flabbergasted Harada and employees of other TV stations.\n \n \"I never could have imagined anything like this,\" Harada, a former member of the male comedy duo Anonenone, told reporters after he was questioned by police on June 2. \"I was stunned.\"\n \n Akihiko Ito, head of the TV station's programming department, said the station would cooperate with police, but defended Harada's actions.\n \n \"We consulted our lawyers, and it is hard to believe that touching a rifle for about six seconds is equivalent to possessing it,\" he said.\n \n A spokesperson with a TV station based in Osaka sharply criticized police.\n \n \"They should have at least asked (Biwako Broadcasting) to cooperate voluntarily,\" a spokesperson said. \"From a common sense standpoint, we cannot even comprehend what the police were thinking.\"\n \n An employee at another TV station was also critical.\n \n \"If we, for example, were to produce a program about a knife shop and an actor picked up a large knife, would the police investigate us, too?\" the employee asked. \"Such an overreaction would be intimidating toward people trying to do their jobs. This would ultimately undermine viewer interest in programming.\"\n \n But police say they don't understand what all the fuss is about. They say the media has, by focusing on the celebrity angle, blurred the facts in the case.\n \n A senior official with the Shiga prefectural police said the real issue is not that Harada briefly held the rifle, but whether bringing the rifle to the live broadcast was appropriate in terms of \"storage and management.\"\n \n An explanation for the police tactics may lie in the revised gun control law, which took effect in January.\n \n The law was tightened after a 37-year-old man in Sasebo, Nagasaki Prefecture, shot and killed two people and wounded six in December 2007. The man, known for erratic behavior, committed suicide after the shooting.\n \n The incident called into question whether existing regulations regarding gun permits and firearm storage were adequate.\n \n \"I believe the hunter who handed the rifle to the actor and the TV crew lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,\" another police official said.\n \n According to the National Police Agency, police can file a case against anybody if he or she, with criminal intent to kill or injure people, possesses a weapon for even a second.\n \n A case can be built based not on the length of time of possession, but on the purpose of possession, the presence of criminal intent and whether the suspect tricked or maneuvered the gun owner.\n \n The Shiga prefectural police justify the raid on the grounds that they had to find out how it was possible to bring a gun to the show.\n \n By transporting the gun to the show, the hunter may have violated the rules under which he was granted a gun permit, police asserted.\n \n They defended questioning Harada and the crew as crucial to ferreting out the real issue--did those involved in the program improperly store and manage the weapon?\n \n Takaaki Hattori, professor of media law at Rikkyo University in Tokyo, says that police went too far.\n \n \"The way the police conducted their investigation is not convincing. I sense they were trying to use the media to sell the public on the revised gun control law,\" he said. \"They should have been more cautious about the exercise of power by public authorities.\"\n \n But he also said the broadcaster could have been more prudent.\n \n \"The TV station should consider whether it was absolutely necessary to use a gun in making the show. The gun owner may have been primarily responsible, but the broadcaster is also to blame for lacking awareness of the law.\"\n \n Takaaki Matsumiya, professor of criminal law at Ritsumeikan University School of Law in Kyoto, disagrees that the TV station or the hunter were in any way culpable and lays the blame on the authorities.\n \n Citing a precedent set by the Tokyo High Court in June 1967, he said: \"The high court decided that the act of touching a handgun for dozens of seconds by a man brokering the sale of a handgun during the transfer did not constitute 'possession,'\" he said. \"There have been no precedents to alter that interpretation. Harada did not 'possess' it (during the show).\"\n \n Matsumiya also defended the hunter who brought the rifle to the set.\n \n \"When the precedent concludes that a person 'has no legitimate reason' for bearing and carrying a firearm, it assumes that he or she was going to do harm or ran a risk of doing harm,\" he said. \"It is obvious that was not the case under these circumstances.\"(IHT/Asahi: July 2,2009)\n \n Now then, what's all this bull**** about how other industrialized nations are better off with regard to guns when compared to America? I don't see such being the case, do you? If you can't even touch a gun that somebody hands you to examine without breaking the law, that is a serious violation of human rights and everything else.\n \n How can Japan be so much better off than we are, if it's a crime for somebody to hand you a rifle to look at but not to keep; especially when it's unloaded!?",

   "\"Gun control in Japan is the most strict in the democratic world. Their weapons law begins by stating 'No-one shall possess a fire-arm or fire-arms or a sword or swords', and very few exceptions are allowed. Gun ownership is minuscule, and so is gun crime. As gun crime in other nations increases, many advocates of gun control urge that Japan's gun control policy be imitated. It is necessary to understand more fully what Japanese gun control is. Exactly what kinds of controls on guns are imposed by the police? How do the controls fit into the context of the overall relationship between the people and the Government? How has Japan, which earlier was a violent nation with large numbers of guns, become almost totally disarmed and come to have such a low violent crime rate? Why do the Japanese comply with stringent controls, when much milder controls have met such intense resistance in America and other Western nations? And what effect have Japanese gun controls had on suicide?\n \n Accordingly, in order to find illegal guns, the Japanese police are given broad search and seizure powers. The basic firearms law permits a policeman to search a person's belongings. If the officer judges there is 'sufficient suspicion that a person is carrying a fire-arm, a sword or a knife' or if he judges that a person 'is likely to endanger life or body of other persons judging reasonably from his abnormal behavior or any other surrounding circumstances'. Once a weapon is found, the policeman may confiscate it. Even if the confiscation is later admitted to be an error, the firearm is sometimes not returned. In practice, the special law for weapons searches is not necessary, since the police routinely search at will. They ask suspicious characters to show them what is in their purse or sack. In the rare cases where a policeman's search (for a gun or any other contraband) is ruled illegal, it hardly matters; the Japanese courts permit the use of illegally seized evidence. And legal rules aside, Japanese, both criminals and ordinary citizens, are much the more willing than their American counterparts to consent to searches and to answer questions from the police.\n \n 'Home visit is one of the most important duties of officers assigned to police...' explains the Japanese National Police Agency. In twice-a-year visit, officers fill out Residence Information Cards about who lives where and which family member to contact in case of emergency, what relation people in the house have to each other, what kind of work they do, if they work late, and what kind of cars they own. The police also check on all gun licensees, to make sure that no gun has been stolen or misused, that the gun is securely stored, and that the licensees are emotionally stable. The close surveillance of gun owners and householders comports with the police tradition of keeping close tabs on many private activities. For example, the nation's official year-end police report includes statistics like 'Background and Motives for Girls' Sexual Misconduct'. The police recorded 9,402 such incidents in 1985, and determined that 37.4 per cent of the girls had been seduced, and the rest had sex 'voluntarily'. The two leading reasons for having sex voluntarily were 'out of curiosity' for 19.6 per cent, and 'liked particular boy', for 18.1 per cent. The fact that police keep records on sex is simply a reflection of their keeping an eye on everything, including guns. Every person is the subject of a police dossier. \n \n Almost everyone accepts the paradigm that the police should be respected. Because the police are so esteemed, the Japanese people cooperate with their police more than Americans do. Cooperation with the police also extends to obeying the laws which almost everyone believes in. The Japanese people, and even the large majority of Japanese criminals, voluntarily obey the gun controls.\n \n There is no right to bear arms in Japan. In practical terms, there is no right to privacy against police searches. Other Western-style rights designed to protect citizens from a police state are also non-existent or feeble in Japan.\n After the arrest, a suspect may be detained without bail for up to 28 days before the prosecutor brings the suspect before a judge. Even after the 28 day period is completed, detention in a Japanese police station may continue on a variety of pretexts, such as preventing the defendant from destroying evidence. Rearrest on another charge, bekken taih\u00f6, is a common police tactic for starting the suspect on another 28 day interrogation process. 'Rearrest' may occur while the suspect is still being held at the police station on the first charge. Some defendants may be held for several months without ever being brought before a judge. Courts approve 99.5 per cent of prosecutors' requests for detentions. \n Criminal defense lawyers are the only people allowed to visit a suspect in custody, and those meetings are strictly limited. In the months while a suspect is held prisoner, the defense counsel may see his or her client for one to five meetings lasting about 15 minutes each. Even that access will be denied if it hampers the police investigation. While under detention, suspects can be interrogated 12 hours a day, allowed to bathe only every fifth day, and may be prohibited from standing up, lying down, or leaning against the wall of their jail cells. Amnesty International calls the Japanese police custody system a 'flagrant violation of United Nations human rights principles'. \n The confession rate is 95 per cent. As a Tokyo police sergeant observes, 'It is no use to protest against power'. Suspects are not allowed to read confessions before they sign them, and suspects commonly complain that their confession was altered after signature. The police use confession as their main investigative technique, and when that fails, they can become frustrated and angry. The Tokyo Bar Association states that the police routinely 'engage in torture or illegal treatment'. The Tokyo Bar is particularly critical of the judiciary for its near-total disinterest in coercion during the confession process. 'Even in cases where suspects claimed to have been tortured and their bodies bore physical traces to back their claims, courts have still accepted their confessions'. \n In Japan, the legal system is, in effect, an omnipotent and unitary state authority. All law enforcement administrators in Japan are appointed by the National Police Agency and receive their funding from the NPA. Hence, the police are insulated from complaints from politicians or other citizens. There is hardly any check on the power of the state, save its own conscience.\n What does the breadth of police powers have to do with gun controls? Japanese gun controls exist in a society where there is little need for guns for self-defense. Police powers make it difficult for owners of illegal guns to hide them. Most importantly, the Japanese criminal justice system is based on the Government possessing the inherent authority to do whatever it wishes. In a society where almost everyone accepts nearly limitless, unchecked Government power, people do not wish to own guns to resist oppression or to protect themselves in case the criminal justice system fails.\n Extensive police authority is one reason the Japanese gun control system works. Another reason is that Japan has no cultural history of gun ownership by citizens.\"",

In a society where almost everyone accepts nearly limitless, unchecked Government power, people do not wish to own guns to resist oppression or to protect themselves in case the criminal justice system fails.\n Extensive police authority is one reason the Japanese gun control system works. Another reason is that Japan has no cultural history of gun ownership by citizens.\"\n\n Japanese Gun Control",
