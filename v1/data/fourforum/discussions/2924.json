   "I'm not sure I see the comparison? Explain.\n\n I think Carlene is referring more to the 'implanting a fertile embryo/zygote into the uterus' IVF version rather than just using donated sperm cells. So essentially the various healthy sperm are selected and incubated with healthy eggs (so you have selected them to avoid a birth defect, or because most of the eggs are unviable and you are using a donor one), a selection of viable embryos are then given the chance to implant themselves in the woman's uterus.\n \n The process involves a lot of zygotes being created, many of which will be unviable and a lot may have been able to develop properly but seeing as usually only one will implant they end up wasted. I can see pro-lifers objecting to the slightly wasteful technique (with some just discarded and not even given the chance to develop) but I think in this situation you can't really complain about the ones which didn't implant - seeing as this happens often enough in normal people, and may have been the reason the couple went after IVF in the first place.\n \n Might be wrong, but in short I think she means IVF rather than artificial insemination. I'd also like to hear the reasoning if it is actually insemination though.",
