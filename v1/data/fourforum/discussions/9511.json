   "It seems to me that ultimately the argument for babies out of the womb is that they have a brain and ones in the womb dont....(you know what i mean)..\n\n As far as I can tell, nobody here in this forum has argued that only born babies have brains. I and others have argued, based on science, that mental existence does not come into play until sometime in the third trimester. Before that, it is not a matter of DEGREE of mental capacity, it is a matter of having ANY mental capacity at all. \n \nBut in all reality.. a baby is no more different at 2 months old than an embryo...\n \n Why.....??\n \n Number 1 - They are both human.. (just as human as you and I)\n\n By human, what SPECIFICALLY do you mean? What human characteristics do 2 month old babies and embryos share that you consider significant?\n \nNumber 2 - They wouldnt know if you killed them cause they dont know they exist (if you were 2 month old and your mom dropped you on your head, you would never have known it and would be dead)\n\n Of course, once we are dead, we no longer know anything about our existence (unless you introduce arguements about an afterlife). As for whether a baby would recognizes the concept of \"I\" in the abstract sense that we only develop later in childhood, none of us are arguing that it has to. \n \n However, a baby certainly would recognize if it was being hurt since babies can feel pain, can have the emotion of fear, sadness from discomfort, etc. Embryos can't. Their brains are not developed enough yet to have any senses register, do not have ANY thoughts, ANY emotions, no mental processes whatsoever. They are incapable of suffering.\n \nNumber 3 - they are just as human as a 70 year old man. Just because they dont have as much knowledge about existing as a 70 year old person doesnt mean they arent a person. that very same 70 year old was in the exact same state 70 and 9months prior. \n\n That same 70 year old was also an unfertilized egg 70 years and 9 months and 1 day ago. Does that mean that we should cherish every unfertilized egg? Our development started even before conception. It just kicked into high gear at conception.",

You can't possibly know you're alive before the part of your brain that produces consciousness has developed. That's after about 20 weeks.",

That is a significant difference. One may argue how significant, but it is silly to say the only difference is time.",
