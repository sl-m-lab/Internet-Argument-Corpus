   "The White House has objected to earmarks co-sponsored by Barack Obama being marked as such. They have ordered the purging his name from the list of earmark sponsors, yet the earmarks remain earmarks...just not his.\n \n Just how blatantly sneaky can one man look?\n \n CQ Politics | Congress to Erase Obama?s Name From Earmark\n \n Congress to Erase Obama's Name From Earmark\n By Jonathan Allen, CQ Staff\n \n Congress will scrub President Obama's name from a list of earmark cosponsors in the $410 billion omnibus spending bill.\n \n The reason: Whether Obama cosponsored the earmark depends on what the definition of earmark is and when an earmark becomes an earmark, according to the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n \n The provision itself is still considered an earmark, and it's staying in the bill (HR 1105) - but it's losing the Obama brand.\n \n As of Thursday, Obama's name appeared along with three dozen other senators as a cosponsor of a $7.7 million line item for vocational training at two schools run by American Indian groups in New Mexico and North Dakota.\n \n The White House objected to the characterization of the provision as an earmark - a sensitive topic, given that Obama said he didn't request any earmarks in 2008.\n \n Subsequently, Senate Appropriations Committee spokesman Rob Blumenthal said Obama's name would be removed from future versions of the congressional report identifying earmarks and their sponsors. Other senators listed with him as cosponsors will be judged on a case-by-case basis.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n **************snip**************\n \n As for the other senators who signed the letter, Blumenthal said they would be judged on a case-by-case basis.\n \n \"The committee will review each member's original request letter and take the appropriate action,\" he said.\n \n Schatz said the entire chain of events shows why Congress should let the public see bills earlier in the process.\n \n \"How many 'accidental' earmarks are there?\" he said.",
