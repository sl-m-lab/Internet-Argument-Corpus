   "Last month, the Republican National Committee used Newsmax's email list -- probably for a fee -- to solicit donations and support.\n \n Newsmax -- which published (and later unpublished) a column saying it's not \"unrealistic\" that there may be a \"military intervention\" against President Obama -- names the RNC as \"our sponsor\" in the email, which is signed by RNC chair Michael Steele.\n \n The message, addressed to \"Fellow conservative,\" asks readers to take a health care survey and contribute \"$1,000, $500, $100, $50 or $25 to help support our efforts to combat the Democrats' attempt to impose 'Obamacare' on all of us.\"\n \n \"You and the RNC are all that stand between our sensible Republican plan for real health care reform and the Democrats' scheme to take more of your hard-earned income to pay for other people's health care while limiting yours,\" it reads.\n\n Republican National Committee Sponsors Newsmax | TPM LiveWire\n The Washington Independent RNC Advertises with Newsmax.com\n \n Wow.\n \n If NewsMax hasn't gone off the deep end in making grossly inaccurate claims...\n ... then the RNC has gone off the deep end in associating themselves as a sponsor of NewsMax...",

Perry it posted:\n \n Going There | Talking Points Memo\n\n \n It just exemplifies how the RNC is back-handedly embracing the hysteria brought on by some \"grass-roots\" movements (and for your example, an actual publication), while publicly trying to whistle nonchalantly and pretend nothing is happening. emoticon_cool\n \n And before I get the inevitable obfuscation, pointing out that the hysteria (like birthers and Obama's a Muslim / socialist / etc, etc) has a \"grass-roots\" approach does not mean that there aren't other grass-roots movements that put forth legitimate arguments.\n Some people lack the logical facilities to understand that talking about yellow lab dogs doesn't mean that EVERY dog is a yellow lab... \n And thus, disclaimers like this are needed... :xbanghead",
