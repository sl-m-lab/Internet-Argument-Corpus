   "While I think that the other posters have spoken well to the use of a firearm for defensive use in terms of ethics, I will try to answer by pointing out some of the shortcomings of popular less than lethal alternatives to firearms. The following is an excerpt from an article that I wrote earlier this year...\n \n \n Some people feel that less than lethal weapons, such as Tasers, stun guns, and pepper spray, are viable alternatives to a firearms for self defense. While all of the above mentioned items are useful tools, they all suffer from limitations that can prove fatal for someone relying on them as a last or only means of protection. These types of weapons are often employed by law enforcement and have shown themselves to be effective in certain situations, but it is important to remember that they are only a single tool designed to accommodate the escalation of force as required by a given situation. What does this mean? \n \n In short, police officers try to use these items in an effort to subdue a suspect with the minimum force needed. This is called escalation of force. This is done to protect both the safety of the officer and the suspect from serious injury. Police officers are trained to meet a threat with a minimum level of force that still affords them an advantage in dealing with a violent or resistive person. As an example, if a police officer faces a suspect with a baseball bat, he is likely to use pepper spray in an attempt to disarm and gain compliance. If the suspect has a more lethal weapon, such as a machete, the officer may elect to use a taser as a means of meeting the more immediate threat posed by a potentially lethal weapon. When met with the threat of a firearm or other projectile weapon that tips the scale in favor of the suspect, a police officer will resort to the most powerful tool immediately available to him...His sidearm. \n \n If the use of these less than lethal weapons is as powerful as some would believe, then why do law enforcement officers carry a sidearm? The simple answer is that a sidearm gives the ability of maintaining an advantage in a lethal encounter. Handguns, offer a level of force that is superior to all of these other weapons, while exhibiting fewer shortcomings.\n \n Tasers, pepper spray and stun guns all share one common problem. They all require you to be within about 15 feet of the aggressor, if not closer, for them to be effective. 15 feet can easily be covered in under two seconds by the average person. If your assailant is armed with a knife, in less than 2 seconds he could close the distance and be within range to strike a lethal blow. If your assailant is armed with a gun, but beyond 15 feet, you have two choices. You can attempt to run away, which may not be an option due to the environment, or you can try to close the distance to the point that your chosen weapon is effective. Yet, your assailant is not nearly as limited by the distance separating him from you. He can fire his gun, with a reasonable chance of inflicting injury or death. The advantage is most definitely in the aggressor's favor.\n \n Let's look at some other properties of these less than lethal options, so we can have a better understanding of what they do and do not offer. First, the taser... The taser is the newest, and arguably, the most effective of popular less than lethal weapons. According to the Taser International website, there are currently three models available for consumer purchase. A taser is similar in operation to a gun, in that you aim it at an aggressor and fire a projectile. The taser does not fire bullets though, it fires two small sharply pointed probes that remain connected to the taser by thin wires. A ten second shaped electrical current is passed through these darts, interrupting muscle control, and temporarily incapacitating the assailant. Because the probes remain connected to the taser, additional charges may be issued to the probes by pulling the trigger again. The Taser also has a backup available should the user miss when firing the probes, or if one or both of the wires are broken. A Taser can be used much like a stun gun by pressing it against the body of an assailant and triggering it. This delivers a electric shock, causing momentary pain.\n \n Now that we know what a Taser is, and how it is used, let's evaluate it's suitability as a maximum force defensive tool. Taser International was founded in 1993 and has enjoyed a huge success in a very short period of time. Many law enforcement agencies now employ Tasers as standard issue for their officers, and with good reason. The Taser has proven to be a very effective and reliable tool in the field for officers. But what about for civilian use as a maximum force tool of last resort? This is where the Taser shows it's weaknesses. The following was copied directly from the owner's manual for the Taser X26C as downloaded from the Taser International website. \n \n POTENTIAL CAUSES OF REDUCED OR NO EFFECTIVENESS\n Loose or Thick Clothing. The current from the X26C is capable of penetrating\n approximately 2 cumulative inches of clothing, or one inch of clothing per probe.\n \n Miss or Single Dart Hit. The current must pass between both probes. If one or both\n probes miss the subject, deploy a second cartridge if available. If one probe has made\n contact with the subject, using the drive-stun on any area of the body will complete\n the circuit and cause NMI. However, the charge effects will stop as soon as the TASER\n X26C is moved away from the subject.\n \n Low Nerve or Muscle Mass. If the probes impact in an area where there is very little\n muscle mass (e.g., the side of the rib cage), the effectiveness can be significantly\n diminished.\n \n Limited Probe Spread. Probe spreads of less than 4 inches (including drive-stun) result\n in little or no effect from NMI and become primarily a pain compliance option. If a\n close range deployment resulting in limited probe spread does not incapacitate the\n subject, apply a drive-stun, as described below, to a point away from the probes. This\n will effectively widen the contact area and can achieve NMI.\n \n Wires Break. If a wire breaks (e.g. during a struggle), the current will not flow to the\n probes. Drive-stun is still available.\n \n DRIVE-STUN BACKUP\n \n Drive-stun capability is available with or without a TASER Cartridge installed. The drivestun\n mode will not cause NMI and generally becomes primarily a pain compliance option.\n \n Probe deployment is usually considered more desirable, even at close range. Some of the\n advantages include:\n Drive-stun is only effective while the device is in contact with the subject or the\n subject's clothing. As soon as the device is moved away, the energy effect stops.\n Deploying the probes allows the user to create distance between the user and the\n subject while maintaining control.\n \n Due to automatic reflex actions, most subjects will struggle to separate from the\n TASER device. When the TASER device is used in the drive-stun mode and the subject\n struggles to get away it may be difficult to maintain contact between the device and\n the subject.\n \n If the probes are deployed, even at very close range, the user may be able to use\n drive-stun to another portion of the body that is farther away from the probes,\n thereby resulting in enhanced NMI effect.\n \n On top of the possible situations in which a Taser may experience less than optimum performance, consider that it can only be shot once before the cartridge must be replaced, and that it has a maximum range of 15 feet. What if there are more than one assailant? Even if the Taser performs exactly as it should, you are now in the possession of a weapon that has to be reloaded before you can defend yourself against additional threats.\n \n \n \n Stun guns\n \n Stun guns suffer from all of the same limitations as a Taser does, yet cannot be used at more than arms length distance. It is a contact weapon that must be pressed against the body of an attacker, and even then is only useful as a pain compliance tool, as it does not typically cause an interruption to motor functions as a Taser will.\n \n Pepper spray\n \n Pepper spray, while allowing you to maintain some separation from an attacker, many times lacks effectiveness due to several reasons. For pepper spray to act quickly, it must be sprayed directly into the eyes and nasal areas of an aggressor. Peeper spray works by causing a heat like pain, involuntary closing of the eyes, and difficulty in breathing. It does not cause incapacitation. While the pain can be quite intense, someone hit with pepper spray can force themselves to open their eyes, and still presents a noticeable threat. Other factors that can influence a persons reaction to pepper spray include drug and alcohol consumption. There have been many cases in which pepper spray was used, that assailants continued to attack and cause injury for a lengthy time. While pepper spray is an effective tool, it lacks the ability to cause incapacitation quickly enough to be considered a maximum force option.\n \n Less than lethal weapons can be effective tools, but their limitations can be a big disadvantage in a lethal encounter. They are best used as law enforcement does, in the escalation of force, to meet a threat that is less than lethal.",

Depending on the circumstances women also have another fear to contend with that men are rarely confronted with-the possibility of suffering great bodily harm by violent sexual assault.\n \n But whether man or woman, if you use deadly force against a person under a claim of self-defense, then you run the risk of having the police disbelieve your justification, the prosecutor charging you with improperly using deadly force, and a judge or jury finding that you really did not have a reasonable belief that you were being threatened with death or great bodily harm.",

   " I so choose.\n\n \n Thank you.\n \n \n Not if the threat is real and potentially life-threatening. Shooting those burglaring you neighbor's house doesn't count. \n\n \n Then are we in agreement that one may shoot and even kill in self defense if necessary to save one&#8217;s own life?\n \n Shooting the neighbor&#8217;s burglar would in my opinion fall outside the parameters of shooting in self-defense. It could, though, be considered defense of others&#8212;depending on the circumstances. This raises another question:\n \n Is shooting in defense of another&#8217;s life an immoral act?\n \n \n Not for home protection. I would not support relaxing CCW restricitions.\n\n \n I am glad to know we are at least in agreement that a firearm is a legitimate home defense weapon. I don&#8217;t know what I would do in an emergency without my firearm. I only have one functioning arrow left for my son&#8217;s NERF Big Bad Bow, and daily use threatens to damage it.\n \n Does this imply you would, if possible, support a ban on possession outside the home?\n \n \n Your right to keep and bear should not be unlimited IMO. If you've been irresponsible with firearms in the past, illegal discharging, illegal carrying, negligence contributing to an accidental shooting, multiple thefts of your weapons, etc., you should forfeit your rights temporarily or possibly permanently. Through due process of course. \n\n \n I am largely in agreement with you here. I have always argued that the RKBA is not absolute. \n \n As an aside, I have found in my years that the greatest use of the &#8220;look how it is written&#8212;it must be an absolute right&#8221; argument has actually been by those who wish to deny the RKBA is an individual right. I have seen many disingenuous variations of the &#8220;it can&#8217;t be an individual right because it is worded absolutely and we can&#8217;t have bubba owning a nuke&#8221; argument.\n \n I believe the right is individual and everyone is entitled to exercise it. But like all other rights it is subject to forfeiture by your own criminal acts&#8212;and not just for those committed while using firearms. Your suggestion of forfeiture terms is in many respects in accord with current law with some possible additions. \n \n When you say &#8220;negligence contributing to an accidental shooting&#8221; do you mean criminal negligence necessary for a conviction of involuntary manslaughter&#8212;or do you mean the lesser civil negligence standard we see in the &#8220;who&#8217;s at fault for the car wreck&#8221; type of cases?\n \n I disagree with denying the RKBA to those who suffer &#8220;multiple thefts.&#8221; I am not in favor of punishing the victims of crime, or in giving them good reason to withhold reporting a theft. But if &#8220;multiple thefts&#8221; was meant to suggest those who nefariously sell guns on the street and then report it as &#8220;theft,&#8221; then I agree with you. \n \n Thank you for mentioning &#8220;due process.&#8221; The concept of &#8220;due process&#8221; has always been associated closely with individual liberties. Many people on this site have argued for banning some or all firearms from some or all people, but very few take the time to consider how &#8220;due process&#8221; impacts their utopian desires. Perhaps this lack of &#8220;due process&#8221; consideration will change now that Heller is decided.",

This is an overestimate since it assumes that guns are 100% effective and that all of the 80,000 crimes that guns were used to defend against were assaults when in fact some were robberies and burglaries (which have lower fatality rates than assaults).

Actually it's not a poor attitude but rather a stupid and misguided belief. Gun control didn't stop the Mumbai massacre, it contributed to it.

You would need laws that allowed the government to search every single building, vehicle and person on a regular basis to look for guns, confiscate them by force, destroy them on sight, and make it a crime punishable by death without a trial to have any chance of criminals not being able to get access to firearms.\n \n Even the laws in Britain aren't keeping the criminals from getting guns. They're importing them illegally and selling them on the street corners like it's no big deal. People are being murdered in gang wars, others are being robbed at gunpoint.

Do you support the rights of Seung-Hui Cho (the VT killer) to buy his guns - regardless of the use to which he put them?\n\n \n Nobody has the option of hindsight in a matter like this. You can't break into an immigrant's home, murder him and his entire family, and hope that what you did was right because he might be in league with Osama Bin Laden.\n \n The VT killer had no criminal record that could be found by either the Virginia police or the FBI. All the background checks came back clean, there were no warning signs that would indicate he was trouble. And unless somebody has something that would raise a red flag during the check, the sale shouldn't be denied.\n \n \nIf you had reason to believe that a gun purchaser was buying the gun that would be used by them in a crime, would you still support their 'right to bear arms'?\n\n \n Licensed dealers already exercise this.

The UK mentality is that no sacrifice is too great if it can lead to even one life saved. The rights of an entire nation? A small price to pay to keep a career criminal from being killed by his intended victim.\nI always try not to be insulting, but this is horrific.

   "that's fair - but it doesn't ring true with the rest of your stance - I suspect that if gun control was brought in and enforced to the letter (which is what I support) then you would still complain.\n\n \n That would depend on what the law in question does. If it specifically punishes those with a criminal record, and only those with a criminal record then no, I wouldn't complain.\n \n \nFor you, it's not 'use them or lose them'. It's 'lose them'.\n\n \n If they're not being used against criminals then they're not worth having. The First Amendment says I can petition the government for a redress of grievances, and since I don't like the laws that do no good then they're on my grievance list.\n \n \nDo you think that having armed civilians (who are likely to be undistinguishable from terrorists in appearance) running around a chaotic scene is going to make life any easier, or the body count any lower?\n \n \n In Mumbai the police hid and cowered for many hours before even approaching the terrorists. That means in all those hours preceding the stop of the terrorists many people were killed simply for being there. Don't you think that if those innocent people were armed, the handful of terrorists would've faced considerable opposition and might have been killed in the process?\n \n \nFurthermore, do you think that having armed civilians is a wise idea for all of that time when there aren't terrorists in the building? Obviously you do - but I would disagree.\n\n \n Of course I do. As we've seen a killer can strike anywhere, anytime, with no warning at all.\n \n By law you have to wear a seat belt at all times when driving, even if you're on a deserted road and couldn't possibly be involved in an accident.\n \n \nAre we talking about the same north holywood shootout?\n\n \n Yes we are.\n \n \nThat certainly looks like 'automatic weapons' to me...\n\n \n And yet they weren't the true machine guns that're regulated by the ATF and require a Class 3 permit to own.\n \n \nBack to the 'rights' argument?\n\n \n How else can it be argued? If gun ownership isn't a right then it's hard to argue against blanket gun control.\n \n \nThere is strong evidence that the crime situation in the US is undesirable - see the international comparison of homicide rates. I agree that there needs to be more evaluation done, but halting everything in order to do so is not justifiable.\n\n \n Maybe so, but a lot of these suggestions for new laws are insane and shouldn't even be considered as a practical solution.\n \n \nYou were on the right track with 'nationwide basis' and 'exceeding anything done (nationwide) previously'. After that, you got excitable and exaggerate-y.\n\n \n Well if you don't have a death penalty for gun ownership then you're not gonna be able to discourage criminals having guns otherwise; the mandatory sentences in the UK sure aren't working.\n \n \nI'm really not sure how you can compare US and UK homicide vs gun homicide rates and say that 'gun laws are having no effect'.\n\n \n Let's look at it this way. In the UK there are no legal methods of anyone owning an operable handgun. There are no stores selling handguns, no shooting ranges for handguns, no handgun clubs. Yet somehow the criminals are still managing to get and use handguns.\n \n The UK laws on handgun possession are absolute in nature, \"not under any circumstances, regardless of who you are\" but criminals are still getting them from somewhere and proving that they have a monopoly on power and force. And since the British police are armed only with sticks, the criminals pretty much have free reign over all of Britain.\n \n \nFair enough - but that's a problem with law enforcement - not the laws themselves.\n\n \n It's a problem with the courts. It's not the police who decide \"No we're not gonna press charges on you for handgun possession even though you're a career criminal\" it's the damn prosecuting attorneys and judges who offer plea deals like candy.\n \n \nI always try not to be insulting, but this is horrific. You've used 'rights' in a country without a constitution, focused on the worst-possible outcome of gun control and misrepresented the 'UK mentality' (chalk one up to generalisation, as well) entirely with a straw man.

   "Ian, my memory's a little fuzzy today. Can you refresh me on the survey methods that the NSPOF uses that would make it innaccurate?\n ...\n What I would like to know about the NCVS is where they do the biggest part of their surveys. Not neccisarily a majority, but at least the bulk. If it's in a place like New York City or DC, for example, you're not likely to find a law-abiding citizen who has defended themselves with a firearm, mainly because it's difficult for them to get a firearm to defend themselves with. Therefore, the majority of people in such areas would say \"no\". I highly doubt that they find every incedent of gun self defence (or even close to it). By surveying random people, you have a better chance of seeing Santa Claus walking out of McDonald's than you do of getting a fairly accurate veiw of how many times people defend themselves. \nI completely missed these posts. Whoops. On the NSPOF: To quote myself from the much-linked thread (which you could just read for yourself, y'know) - \n \n * Your sample size is tiny - 2568 people is 0.000856% of the total US population. With one person surveyed by you representing 116,822 Americans - almost double the total estimated number of people who my survey claims to have used a gun in self-defence, your margins of error are unbelievably huge.\n * Your questioning method does not eliminate people who claim to have used a gun in self-defence where there was no need to (ie - no crime would have occurred without the gun)\n * Your questioning method does not eliminate those who were acting illegally/harmfully when they made their 'self-defence' - for example, a criminal carrying out a crime who 'defends themselves' from a home-owner.\n * Your survey, just as mine, suffers from the problem that some people will lie. However, as this problem only inflates the 'self-defence' figure, it's more of a problem for you than for me - and the fact that your sample size is tiny exaggerates this problem\n\n \n On the NCVS: It is a random-digit telephone surveying method. There won't be a pattern in 'cities vs rural' beyond that controlled by population density - which is a valid pattern to stick to.\n \n \nYou asked.\n \n GunCite-Gun Control-How Often Are Guns Used in Self-Defense?\n \n includes criticisms as well. In short, crimes are almost always reported (that is criminal use of gun if involved) while self-defense situations are less likely to be reported. Also Kleck does make some very good points in his small critique of the NCVS.\n\n You get to post Klecks crit of the NCVS, I get to post the NCVS's critique of Kleck. The relevant discussion is on page 3, and concludes (after reasons) with \"Kleck's findings rest on 49 respondents, and any person who reported self-defense without a victimization would noticeably influence the results. National Crime Victimization Survey interviewers ask about self-defense only when respondents report a crime, and the survey screens out acts that are not illegal. We believe that the Victimization Survey provides a stronger basis for inference than do Kleck's methods.\"\n \n \nLet's say that some politician somewhere passes a law that specifically outlaws any car capable of traveling faster than 65 mph, because such cars are used in high speed police chases and that by banning them it's better for the police. Does that sound alright with you?\nNope, because 'the police' are not the primary concern, the primary concern is 'the people'. Given that the speed limit in the UK is a maximum of 70 mph, the number of man-hours lost to slower speed limits would outweigh the number of man-hours gained by less high-speed chases.\n However, I would have no issue with a limiter on speed set at ~85mph (15mph over the maximum limit in order for motorists to use the extra speed when needed to avoid a collision when they are already travelling at 70). Would you have an issue with such a limiter?\n \n \nNo, a lot of these asinine laws are a source of problems because of how they're worded. They provide no benefit or crime fighting tools, they're useless.\nSo... who are you blaming? The laws, for being badly worded, or the courts, for not enforcing them enough?\n A badly worded law just needs rewording. That's sloppy legislature, but it doesn't affect the validity of the original idea.\n \n \nAh, the classic theory that an unarmed populace will suffer fewer deaths if only the terrorists and murderers are armed, and the people continue to be helpless and their only defense is a cell phone and a 911 operator.\n\n You miss out the other half of that sentence - the rationale. It comes in two parts.\n The first part is 'because an uninformed civilian with a gun is more likely to shoot another armed civilian with a gun than the soldier/terrorist with a gun'\n The second part is 'and in the UK (where the situation is described as exactly that by pro-gunners), the populace does suffer fewer deaths than the US'.\n \n \nHere's all the details you need to know: somebody has an obviously illegal weapon and is murdering people with no regard to human life. If you don't stop that person immediately then many more people are likely to die in very short order.\nSo... lets say the police do rush in. Best case scenario - they save the day. Worst case scenario - they all get shot to pieces by the well prepared terrorists.\n That's not a risk that a commanding officer is willing to take.\n \n Even worse - lets imagine your scenario with an armed populace. Best case - the police rush in and save the day. Worst case #1 - they get shot to pieces by the well prepared terrorists. Worse case #2 - they eventually kill the terrorists, but kill a bunch of civilians in the process because they were armed and were an obvious threat.\n \n \nThat's of no importance.\n\n ...to you, maybe. To me, it matters significantly that there are more gun assaults than gun defences. If seatbelts had killed more people than they saved, would they still be mandatory - or even legal?\n \n \n\"Machine gun\" is the same thing as an \"automatic weapon\".\n\n Only if you go by technical terminology - which I was unaware of until I wiki'd it just now. Apologies.\n To rephrase my original comment, then. \"There's no way of telling how many people would have committed similar crimes were assault weapons legal at the time\". I mis-typed - and should have picked up on it earlier, to be honest. Meh.\n Note that in this case the 'cosmetic features' of the assault rifle - notably the large magazine capacity - played a relatively significant role.\n The main controversy of the NHS, as far as I can see, is not that the robbers were illegally armed but the police were insufficiently armed.\n \n \nNo, I'm asking how else you'd like me to argue against gun control. Should I go the route that gun control has without exception been a primary tool that contributes to mass genocide? Or maybe that it's the product of a mistaken belief that laws are all that's needed to solve crime problems by punishing the innocent? Or maybe that implementing gun control is too cost prohibitive to be effective and thus an exercise in futility and serves no logical purpose?\nDictators - not relevant. 'laws are the only solution' would be a good one to go with. Prohibitive cost would work, too, but only to a mild extent.\n \n The way I am assessing gun control is by the magnitude of it's impact on crime. That would be the best route to take - but as far as i can see, it's not a route that's open to you.\n \n \nLaws like background checks for buying ammunition, bullet registration, criminalizing the failure to report a gun being stolen when people already report them, restricting people with no criminal history to only buying one gun in a 30 day period, denying ownership of a particular gun based solely on aesthetic qualities, etc.\n\n I don't think that 'solely aesthetic qualities' is being pushed... there were some factors that were irrelevant to assault weapons, but that wasn't the main reason for banning them.\n Background checks for buying ammo, 'bullet registration' and making it mandatory to report a stolen firearm should all come under 'gun registration' - which does make sense, but only when accompanied by other measures. I don't see the issue with the 30 day period thing - it's clearly meant to cut down on mass straw-purchasing, which there should be better ways to do - but I can't imagine it inconveniencing that many people.\n \n \nAnd you've also claimed that even with its higher rate of robbery the UK is still safer than the US. That suggests that you're willing to accept crime as a fact of everyday life, but it only bothers you if somebody gets hurt in the process.\n\n When you ask someone 'are you safe' after a crime, you don't expect them to (logically) answer 'no - my purse is gone!' Hysterically, maybe, but not logically.\n \n 'Safety' regards personal health. Robbery without assault does not affect personal health, so it isn't as important. As I've said countless times, I'd far rather stay here and be robbed than go to the US and be killed.\n \n \nThe system isn't haven't any effect. The laws are clear and they're absolute: no handguns period. Now if it were America you might be able to argue that with 50 different states having 50 different sets of laws there was room for getting around the rules through some sort of loophole, but you don't have that excuse over in Britain. You're an island, an isolated point surrounded by water, you don't have a patchwork of laws that could theoretically allow slippage. You have no excuse for criminals still having handguns, and yet they do.\nI'm just going to parody this argument with 'murder' to highlight why it's non-sensical. It's work with 'theft', 'rape', or a host of others, too.\n Murder laws don't have any effect. The laws are clear and they're absolute: no murder, period. [snip]. You have no excuse for criminals still murdering people, and yet they do.\n \n No law will prevent all of the criminalised offence. However, it will reduce occurrences. We've been over this.\n \n \nCharles E. Schumer! The man is a known advocate for very broad gun control laws. Schumer went on record saying that the 1994 AWB wouldn't save a single life and that it's only justification was to desensitize the American people to the idea of a nationwide gun ban. He and his cohorts are hardly a source of anything credible. You might as well be citing Ethmi or Brady and calling them neutral and well meaning.\n\n Fair enough, given that it was (largely) an opinion piece.

The laws, for being badly worded, or the courts, for not enforcing them enough?\n\n \n Well I'm in a bad mood with the way stupidity has been allowed to run unchecked, so I'm blaming everybody; the politicians who passed the law even though they knew it was too ambiguous to be of any use, the courts for flip-flopping and not upholding the laws we already have, and the XXXXXX who write intentionally bad laws.\n \n \nYou miss out the other half of that sentence - the rationale.

The theory is that if the people are unarmed there will be fewer bodies as a result. This is implying that you trust the murderers and terrorists more than you do the people. The whole non-resistance thing is a bad idea no matter how you try to rationalize and defend it.\n \n The theory also suggests that the only possible way you can tell the good guys from the bad guys is by seeing who's armed: the bad guys are the ones with the guns, the good guys are unarmed and being shot as they flee for their lives.\n \n Furthermore the theory suggests that people can't tell who the real threat is. Surely you don't expect us to stupidly believe that we can't tell the difference between your neighbor and a foreign terrorist just because both are armed.\n \n \nSo... lets say the police do rush in.

Worst case scenario - they all get shot to pieces by the well prepared terrorists.\n That's not a risk that a commanding officer is willing to take.\n\n \n There's a huge difference between waiting for backup, and ducking for cover when you're right at the scene, right in the hot zone.\n \n \nEven worse - lets imagine your scenario with an armed populace.

Worse case #2 - they eventually kill the terrorists, but kill a bunch of civilians in the process because they were armed and were an obvious threat.\n\n \n So we're back to the \"only the enemy has guns\" mentality again.\n \n \n...to you, maybe. To me, it matters significantly that there are more gun assaults than gun defences.\n\n \n To me that just says that criminals are more willing to hurt you than not.\n \n \nIf seatbelts had killed more people than they saved, would they still be mandatory - or even legal?\n\n \n Oh I'm sure they would be. Various gun control laws have enabled hundreds of people to be killed (primarily in areas where guns are supposed to be totally banned) and people still claim that such is the safest way of doing things.\n \n \nTo rephrase my original comment, then. \"There's no way of telling how many people would have committed similar crimes were assault weapons legal at the time\".\n \n I mis-typed - and should have picked up on it earlier, to be honest. Meh.\n\n \n What are commonly referred to as \"assault weapons\" were legal at the time of the North Hollywood Shootout. Under the 1994 AWB all the pre-94 weapons were fully legal and could still be owned, possessed, and sold, you just couldn't own any post-94 models with specific cosmetic features attached.\n \n \nNote that in this case the 'cosmetic features' of the assault rifle - notably the large magazine capacity - played a relatively significant role.\n\n \n The \"large capacity magazine\" wasn't a feature of an \"assault weapon\" under the 1994 AWB, it was just another thing that was supposed to be banned and the two became synonymous with each other as a result. Not like the ban did any good though.\n \n \nThe main controversy of the NHS, as far as I can see, is not that the robbers were illegally armed but the police were insufficiently armed.\n\n \n The police have been insufficiently armed for a very long time, it took the NHS to emphasize this fact and bring it to the public's attention. For too long the police have been limited to sidearms and shotguns because of public relations and political correctness issues.\n \n \nDictators - not relevant.\n\n \n Why not? It's awful hard to deny that any nation that carried out genocide did so only after implementing gun control schemes to disarm as many future victims as possible. If it doesn't have modern relevance then it has historic relevance, to show how things happened and what was done.\n \n \n'laws are the only solution' would be a good one to go with.\n\n \n I believe this has already been covered. We have sufficient laws for putting away just about anyone with a criminal history and a charge of firearms possession, but we're not using them and instead saying that we need new laws to address the problem.\n \n \nProhibitive cost would work, too, but only to a mild extent.\n\n \n Mild extent? Implementing some of these dumb ideas would cost millions, or maybe even billions of dollars, there's nothing mild about that. \n \n Let's look at it this way. Let's say that you do manage to get a nationwide ban on some sort of firearm pushed through and it has a requirement that all banned firearms be turned in for destruction; no grandfather clauses. A third or more of the people in this country own at least a single gun, and expecting them all to comply with the new law would require a lot of good faith. I'm sure that with the way things have been going lately, such a law would be the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back and most of the armed populace would outright refuse to comply. If this occurred then things would get very ugly, very quickly.\n \n If there's a nationwide refusal of the people to turn in their now-illegal arms you're looking at a massive undertaking. There's simply not enough police in the country to handle tens of millions of people who aren't going to comply with new laws, requiring you to potentially bring out every federal agent and possibly most of the military branches as well; that's gonna be a lot of man hours and overtime to pay for. If they have reason to believe that a certain location has a large stock of weapons and that the people are hostile then there's gonna be a lot of hours needed to plan what to do, and it might end up like the Waco incident with the police igniting the building to burn it to the ground to ensure that all the illegal guns have been destroyed.\n \n Then there's the issue that the people could become violent once the news starts hitting the airwaves and they might start killing police officers on sight, forcing you to find replacements, train them and equip them, resulting in large scale gun battles and countless wrongful death lawsuits from the families of those slain in the line of duty.\n \n There's also going to be the need for sufficient numbers of transportation vehicles, storage facilities and field gear.\n \n And that's all assuming the people are keeping guns in their homes. To be sure that you get all of the illegal guns that weren't turned in you'd need to extend police powers to the point where they can stop and thoroughly search every road vehicle, and possibly every person, to make sure they're not being illegally transported. This is naturally going to lead to long delays for everybody, making them late for work, family crises, pregnancy, school, etc. What's worse is that an officer may have to examine five hundred or even five thousand cars just to find a single gun. \n \n This is going to be even worse with funeral processions, you'd have to be searching the casket to make sure that it really is a funeral and not a disguised arms trafficking scheme. \n \n And then there's the \"Terminator 3\" possibility, where people might be storing weapons caches in family crypts for safekeeping. How are you going to justify the last resting place of their dead family members because you can't find the guns they're supposed to own but are no longer in the possession of?\n \n \nThe way I am assessing gun control is by the magnitude of it's impact on crime. That would be the best route to take - but as far as i can see, it's not a route that's open to you.\n\n \n That's because I've yet to see sufficient evidence of gun control having a negative impact on crime.\n \n \nI don't think that 'solely aesthetic qualities' is being pushed... there were some factors that were irrelevant to assault weapons, but that wasn't the main reason for banning them.\n\n \n The only way a firearm could be classified as an \"assault weapon\" was by relying on its physical appearance, it's aesthetic qualities. If it had an adjustable stock, pistol grip, flash hider and bayonet lug, then it was an \"assault weapon\", while the same gun with these features removed wasn't an \"assault weapon\" under the law.\n \n \nBackground checks for buying ammo, 'bullet registration' and making it mandatory to report a stolen firearm should all come under 'gun registration' - which does make sense, but only when accompanied by other measures.\n\n \n Background checks for ammunition was one of the clauses under the 1968 Gun Control Act, but that clause was stricken in 1983 when it was found there was no measurable effect to justify its existence.\n \n \nI don't see the issue with the 30 day period thing - it's clearly meant to cut down on mass straw-purchasing,\n\n \n One of the issues is that it has the side effect of shielding criminals from detection. ATF Online - Firearms FAQs\n \n (F5) As a licensed dealer, must I advise ATF if I sell more than one handgun to an individual?\n \n If you sell or dispose of more than one handgun to any non-licensee during a period of 5 consecutive business days, the sale must be reported on ATF Form 3310.4, Report of Multiple Sale or Other Disposition of Pistols and Revolvers, not later than the close of the business day on which you sold or disposed of the second handgun. The licensee must forward a copy of the Form 3310.4 to the ATF office specified thereon, and another copy must be forwarded to the State police or local law enforcement agency where the sale occurred. A copy of the Form 3310.4 also must be attached to the firearms transaction record, ATF Form 4473, documenting the sale or disposition of the second handgun.\n \n A business day for purposes of reporting multiple sales of pistols or revolvers is a day that a licensee conducts business pursuant to the license, regardless of whether State offices are open. The application of the term \"business day\" is, therefore, distinguishable from the term \"business day\" as used in the NICS context. Example: A licensee conducts business only on Saturdays and Sundays, days on which State offices are not open. The licensee sells a pistol to an unlicensed person on a Saturday. If that same unlicensed person acquires another handgun the next day (Sunday), the following Saturday or Sunday, or the Saturday after the reporting requirement would be triggered, the subsequent acquisition of a handgun would have to be reported on a Form 3310.4 by the close of the day upon which the second or subsequent handgun was sold.\n \n [18 U.S.C. 923(g)(3), 27 CFR 478.126a]\n \n Gun rationing laws undercut the ability of the ATF to monitor bulk buyers and determine if they're contributing to criminal matters. I don't believe that allowing criminals to remain free and undetected is the way we should be going, I think that we should be exploiting criminals and getting rid of them. And we can't do that if we can't find them.\n \n \nwhich there should be better ways to do - but I can't imagine it inconveniencing that many people.\n\n \n You wouldn't see it as an inconvenience since you've never been a gun owner. It's very hard to explain cultural issues to somebody of a different culture. It would be like the government saying that you can only buy three gallons of gas per month because they've determined only arsonists have a need for more than that amount at any given time.\n \n \nWhen you ask someone 'are you safe' after a crime, you don't expect them to (logically) answer 'no - my purse is gone!' Hysterically, maybe, but not logically.\n\n \n Logically speaking, you're not safe from crime if you're a repeated victim. We've already covered how the British crime figures exclude those who have been victimized more than a certain number of times, which tells us that multiple victimizations of a single person occurs.\n \n So let me ask you, are you safe after a crime, if you keep facing mugging after mugging after mugging? Being fodder for criminals doesn't sound very safe to me.\n \n \n'Safety' regards personal health. Robbery without assault does not affect personal health, so it isn't as important. As I've said countless times, I'd far rather stay here and be robbed than go to the US and be killed.\n\n \n What're you going to do when you're mugged one day and have nothing to give your mugger? Those guys are gonna be p***ed when you've got an empty wallet, no watch and poor shoes. What then, is your plan to tell them \"I got mugged half an hour ago by some other yob, you got here too late\"?\n \n \nI'm just going to parody this argument with 'murder' to highlight why it's non-sensical. It's work with 'theft', 'rape', or a host of others, too.\n\n \n It doesn't work out that way. Britain is an island, handguns were licensed, and then they were ordered turned in for destruction. That means criminals are having to get their guns from outside Britain, which means they're importing them. If they can get guns into Britain past the borders, that's far different from murder. To murder you've just gotta sneak up on somebody, stab them through the heart, and boom they're a murder victim, it's very simple. But to smuggle guns into the country, that takes considerable effort and is (in theory) easier to prevent than a random killing. But it hasn't worked yet. For every incoming weapons cache you stop, there's at least one you miss.\n \n \nNo law will prevent all of the criminalised offence. However, it will reduce occurrences. We've been over this.\n\n \n We've also been over how I haven't seen sufficient and non-biased evidence to prove this position.",

   "\n \n You get to post Klecks crit of the NCVS, I get to post the NCVS's critique of Kleck. The relevant discussion is on page 3, and concludes (after reasons) with \"Kleck's findings rest on 49 respondents, and any person who reported self-defense without a victimization would noticeably influence the results. National Crime Victimization Survey interviewers ask about self-defense only when respondents report a crime, and the survey screens out acts that are not illegal. We believe that the Victimization Survey provides a stronger basis for inference than do Kleck's methods.\"\n \n\n \n I think the Doctors assumptions though are way too convenient. First, who defines what self-defense really is? Does that mean you have to file a police report in order to be consider self-defense. Some people do not even report a thing to the police as they see no point if no harm was done. Kleck specifically asks if in self-defense. In some cases the firearm doesn't need to be fired just shown to deter the criminal. Even yelling \"I have gun\" is enough for a criminal to turn away.\n \n Not only that. Dr. McDowall ignores a dozen of other survey's done that suggest numbers much higher than the 68,000 the NCVS supposedly states. So, either those survey's are all wrong or the NCVS method is flawed. I vote for the later. Not only that the good Dr. specifically states in his last sentence, \n \n \"Altogether, our results suggest that\n criminals face little threat from armed\n victims. The probability of firearm resistance\n is not zero. Yet given that half ofUS\n households own a gun, armed selfdefense\n is extremely uncommon.9 Coupled\n with the risks of keeping a gun for protection,\n these results raise questions about the\n collective benefits of civilian firearm ownership\n for crime control.\"\n \n This is specifically citing the Kellermann study which was deemed flawed by many scholars even Kellermann himself! I think the study is a bit dated as well. I think it's time for a new NCVS with good definitive methods that as very specific questions unlike IMHO the last NCVS.",

Surely you don't expect us to stupidly believe that we can't tell the difference between your neighbor and a foreign terrorist just because both are armed.\nThe theory states that people without decent training and knowledge of a situation only endanger themselves and others by being given a level of lethal force which they can misapply all too easily. You are (again) exaggerating my position with regards to 'neighbor vs foreign terrorist' - go into any large city, and see what percentage of the people you know.\n \n \nThere's a huge difference between waiting for backup, and ducking for cover when you're right at the scene, right in the hot zone.\n\n Indeed. One of them gets you safe, the other one keeps you safe. Both prevent friendly fire 'collateral'.\n \n \nOh I'm sure they would be.

   "Again, how is this relevant?\n\n \n I don't know, you're the one that brought it up in the first place.\n \n \nI don't particularly care about where it comes from (although the film is rather awesome. But I digress). I'm more interested in the content of what it says. Would you care to address that?\n\n \n Not particularly, because it's nothing but ####. Hollywood has no relevance to real life, it's not even about entertainment anymore, it's just politics. I'll give you some examples.\n \n In \"Robocop 2\" there was a scene where street criminals broke into a run of the mill gun store and store several fully operational rocket launchers and machine guns, even though no such gun store would have items like these in stock at any time.\n \n In various instances on \"Law and Order\" it's suggested that anybody who insists on the police having a search warrant, rather than letting them just look around because they asked to, or anybody who's familiar with the various rights mentioned in the Constitution, is a guilty party, has something to hide, or is a dangerous individual that intends to harm others.\n \n You can't even go two action movies without seeing some instance of somebody shooting the gas tank of a car and managing to blow it sky high in a massive explosion.\n \n Some actor on a crappy series or movie says something you consider noteworthy and I'm supposed to treat it as a relevant point? I don't think so; especially when it just embraces the whole non-resistance concept of how it's safer to be victimized than try and do the right thing.\n \n \nI'd say that knowing the identity of (read: being able to identify) the terrorists is kinda vital, wouldn't you? \"The guys walking about with guns\" is a poor identifier when everyone is armed.\n\n \n Not really. If somebody's walking up and down the street like they own it, and opening fire on anybody they see for no reason at all, then that's all the information you need to know. You don't need to know who that guy is, you don't need to know why he's killing people at random, you don't need to know if he legally acquired his weapons or imported them through illegal channels, all you need to know is that he's killing people. This is the situation as it happened in Mumbai. How much more can you possibly need to know?\n \n I know that you think Hollywood movies are real and relevant to real life and all, but you're unlikely to see long and drawn out gun battles between a terrorist and a concerned citizen. It's not going to be like the opening shootout in \"Predator 2\" where thousands of rounds are being fired and cars are being shot and blown up.\n \n \nWell, you said that it would be OK if only those who had had training went out with their guns. in order for this to happen, the only ones who can have guns must be the trained ones - unless you want to somehow 'control' the untrained people with guns to stop them from going out with them.\n\n \n I never said that. I asked about the people who did have the training that would better enable them to actually do something about the problem. How did you manage to twist that into reading \"only those who have training should have guns\"?\n \n \nHow? Would those guns not be controlled by the ban? If not, why not?\n\n \n You're not getting it are you?\n \n The whole \"assault weapons\" issue is ruled purely by cosmetics and nothing else. If it looks military, it's banned. If it works the same as what's banned but looks different, it's not.\n \n We've been over this before, the only way to define an \"assault weapon\" is to go by its cosmetic features, it's appearance, and say that anything that has those features is evil and non-sporting in nature. And thus we're going back to open racism and letting appearance be the ultimate decision maker.\n \n \ni have a feeling that you're using multiple definitions of 'assault weapon'. Note that (from the wiki page) Note: there are differing definitions of 'assault weapon' that are listed at Assault weapon. This page refers to the usage in the United States under the previous and proposed assault weapon bans.\n\n \n No I'm only using one definition. If I were using multiple definitions I'd be going into detail of what makes a handgun qualify as an \"assault weapon\" or a shotgun. Or I'd go on about how California redefined \"assault weapons\" to include single shot rifles of .50 caliber. Or I'd bring up the point of one state trying to ban pistols with compensated barrels by reclassifying them as \"assault weapons\". Or I'd go into how New York tried to expand their AWB to include pump and lever action rifles that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition in a fixed tubular magazine.\n \n \nLike I said - without drastically redefining 'safe'.\n\n \n Somebody knows that they can exploit you regularly and at their pleasing, that they can get money from you anytime they want, and they keep coming back to you over and over and over again, using threats of bodily harm if you don't comply. How does that make you safe?",

The pistol grip was never intended to facilitate firing from the hip like so many claim, in fact I've never even seen a military training manual that advocates firing from the hip. Have you?\n \n The pistol grip was introduced on rifles such as the AK-47, the M16 and other models, because of the chance in design. On previous models there was a bend in the comb of the stock that raised the barrel and sights up, and gave the shooter something to hold onto when shooting. When that design changed the barrel was moved to be more in line with the stock, taking the bend away and giving the shooter nothing to hold onto, so the pistol grip was introduced.\n \n Seriously, take a look at some of these weapons sometime, you'll notice that from the nose of the rifle to the butt of it, it all follows a largely straight line. Where exactly would you hold onto it with your shooting hand without a pistol grip?\n \n Adjustable stocks don't make the weapon easier to conceal. For a rifle to be civilian legal it has to be at least 26\" long, and have a barrel of 16\", otherwise you have to register it with the ATF as a short barreled rifle. Being 26\" long and weighing at least seven pounds makes for an extremely difficult to conceal package. The real reason for folding stocks is to compensate for areas where space is at a premium, like in the hallway of a home.\n \n Telescopic stocks could be considered a safety feature for shooters. The average length of pull, from butt to trigger, is 14\" and designed for somebody around 6' tall. A lot of shooters aren't built to handle a 14\" LOP and as a result get seriously hammered by the recoil, so being able to immediately adjust the stock to somebody of a smaller frame makes it easier for them to safely fire the weapon.\n \n The flash suppressor was designed to ensure that a shooter didn't blind themselves in low light situations from the flaming ball of gas that exits the barrel behind the bullet. It's not going to hide your position when you're shooting at people, but it'll keep you from damaging your eyes.\n \n Bayonet lugs...when was the last time there was a civilian bayoneting to even make it noteworthy? Besides that, the gun itself can already be used as a melee weapon, that's how we came up with the term \"butt stroke\". You wanna ruin somebody's day, hit them in the head with the butt end of a ten pound rifle or shotgun.\n \n Threaded muzzles are how you attach the flash suppressor, but are also used in attached muzzle breaks, barrel compensators, or sound suppressors. Interestingly, grenade launchers, grenades themselves, and sound suppressors are very closely and strictly regulated by the ATF, meaning that banning where they attach is a moot point, wouldn't you agree?\n \n As for magazines allowing quick changes, can you come up with a justifiable explanation as to why people should be forced to take the slowest route possible in reloading their weapon of choice?\n \n Regardless, when it comes down to it, none of these functions makes a gun any deadlier than a gun that doesn't have any of them, so in the end they're nothing more than cosmetic differences.\n \n \nThat's called 'playing the assumption game'. As I recall, you're not a fan of it.\n\n \n The UK papers specifically state that the police stop counting instances of robbery after an individual has been accosted more than a certain number of times a year, indicating that people are routinely robbed or mugged.",

How does this stand up to the reality of a prolonged siege?\n\n \n As far as I'm aware, the only reason it was a prolonged siege was because nobody could provide any sort of opposition to the terrorists. Had somebody been able to kill them, either by running them over with a truck as they were crossing a street, or dropping a molotov cocktail on them from a second story window, things might have been different and ended a lot sooner.\n \n \nYou think that the ability to add a grenade launcher or a bayonet, the ability to shoot around corners with greater ease (regardless of the 'advised training') and the ability to fire more before having to reload don't count as 'offensive features'?\n\n \n No I don't. For starters, I've never seen a grenade launcher that was designed to screw onto the barrel of today's rifles. I even checked some of the known sales sites for transferable Title II items, I've never found one. To me the language seems like what DC had, which allowed them to ban all semi-automatic firearms because somebody somewhere might have made a magazine that holds more than 12 rounds of ammunition.\n \n Secondly, I've never seen anybody who's been killed or injured with a rifle that has a bayonet attached, outside of an actual war. Have you? The point on the bayonet lug is moot.\n \n Thirdly, I've never seen it be proven that you can't shoot around corners with a gun that lacked a pistol grip.\n \n If these were truly offensive features, then why doesn't the military utilize them on their main offensive weapons? The main weapon in war isn't the firearm, it's high explosives, we outfit the soldiers with guns for their own protection.\n \n \nSo your only argument against is 'it might be the start of a slippery slope'? Given the possibility that it may have saved lives at the cost of very little (especially as all that was needed to sell a new gun was to remove some features), I wouldn't call it sufficient...\n\n \n I've done an online search to try and locate anyone that's been charged with a crime for having a rifle with an attached flash suppressor, bayonet lug or folding stock, going as far back as 1994 to now, and I haven't been able to find a single case of somebody ever being found guilty of such an offense. In the entire 14 years since the introduction of the AWB law, I've only been able to find two cases of anybody ever being charged for violating such laws, neither of which ever resulted in a guilty conviction.\n \n Does that really sound like an effective law to you, one that deserves to be renewed and made permanent?\n \n And then there's the famous quote by Charles Schumer, the author of the original 1994 bill:\n \n \"In fact, the assault weapons ban will have no significant effect either on the crime rate or on personal security. Nonetheless, it is a good idea. Passing a law like this is a symbolic -purely symbolic- move. It's only real justification is not to reduce crime but to desensitize the public to the regulation of weapons in preparation for their ultimate confiscation.\"\n \n Does that sound like it has any reasonable of justifiable excuse for being law?",

   "It's relevant when you consider one of the definitions of hero: \"A person noted for feats of courage or nobility of purpose, especially one who has risked or sacrificed his or her life.\"\n\n The difference between the 'heros' of the police and the would-be 'heros' of the public? Training and information (and the police get paid). I've said this a lot of times, recently.\n \n \nSo you're alright if people fight back against their attackers, so long as their unarmed and the best they can do is make their killers waste more ammunition? Being cannon fodder doesn't sound like a viable solution to me.\n\n No, I'm differentiating between 'fighting back against your attackers' and 'going out and shooting anyone you perceive as a threat'. You're just ignoring one.\n \n \nIt was a slaughter, plain and simple.\n ...\n And what about the people during those 48 hours, who only had the options of running and dying? That's a very long time to wait for help and be at the mercy of somebody who'll kill you just because you're alive.\nIn other words - yes, you do have a poor understanding of what happened in Mumbai. Either that, or you are deliberately simplifying to the point of total generalisation in order to further your argument. \n In only the one case (as reported by that one source - I haven't seen any others) did the police 'hold back' - in another area, the police shot at a Skoda carrying some terrorists, killing one and capturing the other. The gunmen in the hotels deliberately made use of the area in an attempt to confuse the police/army - they also had fake IDs, rations and both American and Indian currency. Their aim was to 'create an international incident' and then 'secure hostages for safe passage' (direct paraphrases from the captured gunman - see the links in the above post).\n \n Giving the populace guns in this situation would only have made the body count higher. The reason that it was 48 hours was so that the army could conduct a thorough sweep of the building and make sure they got the terrorists and not the civilians - nothing would change that, not even the corpses of terrorists (and the bystanders/hostages/'collateral' near them). The other reason I suspect it took so long is that the terrorists had, or may well have had hostages - and it's standard to hang back in such situations, because it saves lives.\n \n Please read the linked articles above and gains some understanding of the event before you misrepresent it again.\n \n \nWell if you want something more recent and unique, I could mention the Los Angeles Race Riots of 1992, which lasted for six days and involved thousands of rioters who were burning down a lot of businesses, and the only ones who escaped having their stores burnt down were store owners who had guns on hand for shooting those armed with molotov cocktails coming their direction.\n\n And no doubt in some other cases, guns have saved the lives of their owners. However, this is only an important fact if it outweighs all the times guns have been used to victimise others - which simply isn't the case. You've disagreed with me on this a couple of times now, but have shied away every time from actually raising issues with my data.\n \n Looking back at the original question that led to this quote (that individuals do better than the army at killing terrorists), I'm not sure (again) how this is a relevant situation (as far as the original question goes).\n \n \nAs far as I'm aware, the only reason it was a prolonged siege was because nobody could provide any sort of opposition to the terrorists. Had somebody been able to kill them, either by running them over with a truck as they were crossing a street, or dropping a molotov cocktail on them from a second story window, things might have been different and ended a lot sooner.\nYou are 'aware' wrong - and without excuse; I've pointed this out to you multiple times already (reading the links above would have been a good start...) The police/army were in action for most of the period of the siege.\n \n How did gun control prevent people from 'running [the terrorists] over as they crossed a street'? Come to that - how did it prevent people making molotovs and dropping them on the terrorists? It's illegal to make 'em, but the materials aren't and I doubt many people would have them lined up ready to drop if they were legal to manufacture, especially in a hotel...\n \n \nIf these were truly offensive features, then why doesn't the military utilize them on their main offensive weapons? The main weapon in war isn't the firearm, it's high explosives, we outfit the soldiers with guns for their own protection.\nI've skipped the functions part for the moment because we're going to go nowhere. I can see how many of the functions aid offensive action, and you either can't and/or don't want to, because it would weaken your argument. I doubt that's going to change.\n \n Regarding the quoted - that's because the nature of war has changed. When war was actually closer-range combat (as would be the case in most criminal actions), firearms were definitely the primary weapon - bayonets and all.\n \n \nDoes that sound like it has any reasonable of justifiable excuse for being law? \nLike I said a long way back - it was a good idea implemented badly. I don't believe that there is enough statistics on the effects of the ban to make a final judgement on it, but it could have had very little effect. With that said, however, you haven't particularly come up with a good reason to get rid of the ban once it was in place, either. It will be interesting to see what Obama does with regards to reinstating and/or modifying the law.\n \n Oh, and I believe you've mis-attributed your quote. It's not from an official figure at all - but instead is from Charles Krauthammer, a Washington Post columnist. Dunno where you got it from - but it's wrong.",

Come to that - how did it prevent people making molotovs and dropping them on the terrorists? It's illegal to make 'em, but the materials aren't and I doubt many people would have them lined up ready to drop if they were legal to manufacture, especially in a hotel...\n\n \n When you breed an environment of helplessness and nonresistance what can you expect? The subway goers of Britain saw who was responsible for the bombings, but they didn't do anything to stop them. They didn't go after them in large mobs to drag them back and beat them to a pulp.\n \n \nI've skipped the functions part for the moment because we're going to go nowhere. I can see how many of the functions aid offensive action, and you either can't and/or don't want to, because it would weaken your argument. I doubt that's going to change.\n\n \n Well explain this. How do the features selected for this discussion, make them unsuitable for defensive purposes?\n \n \nRegarding the quoted - that's because the nature of war has changed. When war was actually closer-range combat (as would be the case in most criminal actions), firearms were definitely the primary weapon - bayonets and all.\n\n \n I must object, you obviously don't know much about the history of war.\n \n In the time of World War One there were truly powerful weapons. Cartridges like the .30-06, the .303 British, the 7.62x54R, the 7.92 Mauser, the 8mm Lebel and other such rounds were designed for distances out to 1,000 yards or more. This was in the time of trench warfare when the tank was king on the battlefield, when the Germans objected to the American use of the shotgun because it was so effective at clearing out trenches, and when submachine guns saw more widespread use before soft body armor became widespread.\n \n The nature of war has changed alright, it's grown into urban warfare. Look at the weapons of today, the AK-74, the M4 carbine, the FN P90, the H&K G36 the Steyr AUG, etc. The armies of various countries have been switching to morel lightweight weapons, firing smaller calibers that're effective out to only 300 or 400 yards because it's been determined that the majority of instances rarely happen at distances further than this. It's reasons like this that the American military switched from the M14, which was a great design, to the less proven and still experimental M16.\n \n \nLike I said a long way back - it was a good idea implemented badly. I don't believe that there is enough statistics on the effects of the ban to make a final judgement on it, but it could have had very little effect. With that said, however, you haven't particularly come up with a good reason to get rid of the ban once it was in place, either. It will be interesting to see what Obama does with regards to reinstating and/or modifying the law.\n\n \n As I've said, I've searched for any instance of a conviction resulting from the possession of a weapon that has certain banned features. And in the entire 14 years I searched, from 1994 until now, the only two cases of arrest that I could found never resulted in a guilty conviction. Now if those two people really did break the law, why didn't they go to prison for ten years like the law says they were supposed to? How did it save any lives if that's the way it went?\n \n You want a better argument, how about this: the AWB is a divide and conquer technique designed to weaken the resolve of gun owners as a whole and trick them into thinking that the anti-gunners only want to ban certain guns but they'll ultimately leave the majority of the population armed and not bother them. We're too strong and smart to be beaten as a whole, so they have to pick off those on the edge to weaken the herd.\n \n \nOh, and I believe you've mis-attributed your quote. It's not from an official figure at all - but instead is from Charles Krauthammer, a Washington Post columnist. Dunno where you got it from - but it's wrong.\n\n \n I was told that the \"Krauthammer\" was a jab at Schumer's perceived anti-freedom position and a comparison with Nazism since \"Kraut\" is a slang term for Nazi Germans.",

You are right about the group of armed terrorists, and the splitting into groups - but most of those groups went straight to their hotels.

And misrepresentation (again). I said that the features 'aided offensive purposes', not 'hindered defensive purposes'. I'm fairly sure that a recent post of mine outlines some of the ways in which this is the case.\n\n \n No on both counts. You haven't explained how the selected features make a selected firearm more offensive than they would be without them attached. You've listed all of the anti-gun insanity regarding these cosmetic features, but done nothing to explain how they're offensive in nature.\n \n As explained, the pistol grip was to provide a new handhold since the old one on the stock was no longer possible. Why haven't you addressed that point, but rather claimed it was to make shooting around a corner easier?\n \n \nI would say that you're missing a few facts, actually. For example...\n You said that 'the tank was the king of the battlefield' in WW1. However, WW1 took place from 1914 to 1918.

While this may be entirely true - doesn't this completely ignore what you were saying a while ago about 'high powered explosives'?\n \n \n Not a bit. The military is still using howitzers, RPGs, SAMs, SASs, rockets, general missiles, and other such devices that can hurl an explosive charge over a great distance and bring down an entire building in a single hit. If guns were the primary weapon of war then we would never engage in bombings.\n \n \nI'm fairly sure that most (if not all) of 'the weapons of today, the AK-74, the M4 carbine, the FN P90, the H&K G36 the Steyr AUG, etc.' would be covered by the AWB - by their features at least (semi-automatic vs automatic aside).\n\n \n Nope, the versions used by the military are true machine guns, models that haven't been legal for sale to civilians since early 1986.\n \n As for their eligibility under the AWB, it was already covered. If you take an AR-15 that has all the banned features under the language of the AWB and you make the following changes: cut off the bayonet lug, replace the adjustable stock with a fixed design, don't thread the muzzle, and put in a fixed and non-removable magazine, then the gun can no longer qualify for banning because it doesn't have the offensive features attached. Colt, Bushmaster and other companies did this already and proved it true.\n \n It was of little impact though, because all of the \"pre-ban\" guns were still fully legal and could be bought or sold in a legal manner.\n \n \nA low conviction rate for a law means two things - either that the law is not being enforced properly, or that most people are obeying that law. Either the AWB saved lives, or it simply wasn't enforced enough.\n\n \n To suggest that the low conviction rate was because the law was being obeyed during its entire time in effect is laughable. Not a single individual with a criminal history was arrested on charges of violating to law. To suggest that they went to great lengths to abide by the new law is like saying somebody bent on robbing a bank won't jaywalk because it's illegal.\n \n \nIsn't that your 'slippery slope' argument, just reworded with a varying degree of paranoia?\n\n \n It's neither paranoia nor the slippery slope argument, it's a recognized battlefield tactic; divide and conquer. If you can't take the enemy all at once then you take them bit by bit, by having them do all the hard work for you.",

   "So...the police get a call from a woman claiming that somebody's broken into her home, the police get there ten minutes later, they find the woman dead and the intruder nowhere to be found, and that's the better of the two impacts?\n\n That's an entirely different situation from the Mumbai incident, and regards a single woman and a single (or multiple) assailant. It's fairly easy, in that situation, to identify who is who.\n \n \nAnd in the middle of it all, there are the terrorists armed with AK-47s. How hard would it be to identify them as the bad guys?\n\n It depends on what everyone else is armed with, if you know that the bad guys are the ones with AK-47s, and if the bag guys didn't start using their 9mm revolvers instead. When the end result is life or death, do you really want to gamble against all of those odds?\n \n \nNo it's not, it's just more of the fear-mongering \"better to be unarmed and helpless than to try and resist\" mentality. In the Mumbai situation you had armed terrorists with absolutely no regard for life, able to and engaging in the killing of people for absolutely no reason, shooting into crowds and killing entire families with no opposition, and you're trying to get me to believe that the situation would've been worse if the targets could have shot back and possibly killed a few of the terrorists because the military/police eventually arrived on the scene whenever that was.\nAgain, this is a misrepresentation of both the majority of what happened at Mumbai and of my mentality regarding the situation. The 'crowd-shooting' was the minority incident, the majority of the event took place in conditions very similar to those that you described in parody, above. My attitude towards this is that citizens with guns are more likely to shoot the wrong person and put themselves in harms way, than do any actual good.\n \n A question for flyboy again; should he be reading this thread: As a police officer, would you rather that a citizen who witnessed an armed burglary informed the police, stayed out of the way and pointed them in the right direction on arrival, or got their gun and went to see if they could shoot some criminals?\n \n \nWhen you're in a situation where your heart is pounding, blood is pumping, and adrenaline is surging, compliance even when you're absolutely positive the person talking to you is a police officer isn't going to be immediate.\n\n Exactly. With that in mind, would you rather the non-complier had a gun, or not?\n \n \nYou said that you have no problem with people defending themselves, but you weren't in favor of people defending themselves with a weapon, suggesting that unarmed fighting is alright to you, but once some sort of weapon is introduced then you're not in favor of it anymore.\n\n No I didn't. I said: \"And no doubt in some other cases, guns have saved the lives of their owners. However, this is only an important fact if it outweighs all the times guns have been used to victimise others - which simply isn't the case. You've disagreed with me on this a couple of times now, but have shied away every time from actually raising issues with my data.\"\n I am all in favour of people defending themselves - with a weapon, if need be. However, it's when that same weapon is used to attack others with a higher frequency than it is used to defend that I have a problem. This is the case for guns.\n \n \nNew air bags can cause injuries considering how fast they're deployed.\n \n What I'm focused on is that it's better to be able to fight back, than to be able to do nothing at all.\nMore in the US, actually; because the deployment speed requirement is higher than in the UK. You've abandoned a little bit of safety when it deploys for a safer overall result in more situations - why can't you do the same thing with guns?\n \n And as I've said before (and you've agreed) - you don't need a gun in order to fight back. I'd also add to that that 'running away' is a highly recommended option if personal safety is your biggest concern.\n \n \nHow, is he going to mistake the woman with the stroller as the active shooter?\nNo; he's likely to miss the shooters, possibly hit some bystanders, and draw gunfire towards himself. He'll also be a threat to the police when they do turn up (which is generally quite fast, both in Mumbai and everywhere else)\n \n \nThat's true, but they're more effective than anything else and have a better chance of working when compared to all of the more politically correct alternatives.\n\n And they are also misused a lot more than 'all of the politically correct alternatives'. It doesn't balance in their favour.\n \n \nNo on both counts. You haven't explained how the selected features make a selected firearm more offensive than they would be without them attached. You've listed all of the anti-gun insanity regarding these cosmetic features, but done nothing to explain how they're offensive in nature.\n \n As explained, the pistol grip was to provide a new handhold since the old one on the stock was no longer possible. Why haven't you addressed that point, but rather claimed it was to make shooting around a corner easier?\n\n With regards to the pistol grip; I'm not concerned with the original purpose of the feature, I'm concerned with how it could actually be used. With regards to everything else - see the 'anti-gun insanity'. Ultimately, all you've come up to counter it is more opinion; which is why I dropped the subject.\n \n \nTo suggest that the low conviction rate was because the law was being obeyed during its entire time in effect is laughable. Not a single individual with a criminal history was arrested on charges of violating to law. To suggest that they went to great lengths to abide by the new law is like saying somebody bent on robbing a bank won't jaywalk because it's illegal.\nI didn't suggest that; it was just one of two alternatives - both of which you seem to disagree with.\n Either people obeyed the law, or they didn't. If they obeyed the law - fantastic, that explains the low convictions. If they didn't obey the law, then the low convictions show that the law wasn't being enforced enough.\n Your alternative 'it was a rubbish law' is not really relevant to either of those situations.",

   "That's an entirely different situation from the Mumbai incident, and regards a single woman and a single (or multiple) assailant. It's fairly easy, in that situation, to identify who is who.\n\n \n So if a positive identification of the threat can be made, then you'd alright with somebody not of the military or police killing them?\n \n \nIt depends on what everyone else is armed with, if you know that the bad guys are the ones with AK-47s, and if the bag guys didn't start using their 9mm revolvers instead. When the end result is life or death, do you really want to gamble against all of those odds?\n\n \n If I have reason to believe that I'm likely to die regardless of what happens, then I'd much rather die trying to be a hero and actually do some good with the time I've got left, instead of cowering behind a piece of flimsy concealment hoping that my life would somehow be spared.\n \n \nAgain, this is a misrepresentation of both the majority of what happened at Mumbai and of my mentality regarding the situation. The 'crowd-shooting' was the minority incident, the majority of the event took place in conditions very similar to those that you described in parody, above. My attitude towards this is that citizens with guns are more likely to shoot the wrong person and put themselves in harms way, than do any actual good.\n\n \n That may be your attitude, however I haven't seen any proof that would support this. I haven't found any evidence supporting the idea that being unintentionally wounded by civilian gunfire is a real concern in states that allowed concealed carry.\n \n \nExactly. With that in mind, would you rather the non-complier had a gun, or not?\n\n \n I don't know what I'd prefer if I were a police officer, but speaking from my experience and how I feel right now, I'd much rather know that people aren't counting on me to get there in time to save their lives like some 1950s comic book superhero who always gets there in the nick of time. It's an ugly world out there, and if you can't take care of yourself and instead rely on an outside influence to provide your safekeeping, then the odds are good that you'll suffer or die before help ever gets there.\n \n I'd rather they have the gun than be without. If they have it then that means they'll be better able to take care of themselves if I can't get there immediately after the call comes in. Seconds mean lives in these cases, you can't rely on help that's three minutes away when danger can reach you in 30 seconds.\n \n \nI am all in favour of people defending themselves - with a weapon, if need be. However, it's when that same weapon is used to attack others with a higher frequency than it is used to defend that I have a problem. This is the case for guns.\n\n \n To me that would suggest that we have far too many criminals free in society.\n \n \nAnd as I've said before (and you've agreed) - you don't need a gun in order to fight back.\n\n \n You do if you're physically inferior to your attacker, because no matter how you try and rationalize it, a lady in a wheelchair can't possibly hope to incapacitate her mugger through martial arts.\n \n \nI'd also add to that that 'running away' is a highly recommended option if personal safety is your biggest concern.\n\n \n If you run from a dog it'll pursue and maul you, running from a mugger will lead to worse because the mugger is capable of feeling a wider range of emotions and will hurt you out of spite.\n \n And what's the answer for people who can't run away, like those in a leg brace?\n \n \nNo; he's likely to miss the shooters, possibly hit some bystanders, and draw gunfire towards himself. He'll also be a threat to the police when they do turn up (which is generally quite fast, both in Mumbai and everywhere else)\n\n \n How do you know he'd miss the shooter? How would he be more of a threat to the police?\n \n \nAnd they are also misused a lot more than 'all of the politically correct alternatives'. It doesn't balance in their favour.\n\n \n You know what? I simply don't care anymore. No matter what you try and do, for every positive aspect there's always going to be a negative one as well.\n \n \nWith regards to the pistol grip; I'm not concerned with the original purpose of the feature, I'm concerned with how it could actually be used. With regards to everything else - see the 'anti-gun insanity'. Ultimately, all you've come up to counter it is more opinion; which is why I dropped the subject.\n\n \n Then how do you feel about stun guns, tasers and pepper spray? They were originally designed as non-lethal defensive tools, but it's becoming more common for them to be used as devices of torture according to Amnesty International.\n \n \nI didn't suggest that; it was just one of two alternatives - both of which you seem to disagree with.\n Either people obeyed the law, or they didn't. If they obeyed the law - fantastic, that explains the low convictions. If they didn't obey the law, then the low convictions show that the law wasn't being enforced enough.\n Your alternative 'it was a rubbish law' is not really relevant to either of those situations.\n\n \n Even Bill Clinton who signed the AWB into law admitted that it wasn't doing anything to save lives or make people safer.",

Even if they were not very well trained or had very little at all (which most people do) it would have been a lot better than not having a gun at all. Most people would have run away.

   "A question for flyboy again; should he be reading this thread: As a police officer, would you rather that a citizen who witnessed an armed burglary informed the police, stayed out of the way and pointed them in the right direction on arrival, or got their gun and went to see if they could shoot some criminals?\n\n \n I am a bit surprised by the way you posed this question Ian. As I am sure you are aware, this wording poses a very broad and general question and seemingly asks for a specific answer. I think all here would agree that I am a proponent of lawful citizens owning firearms, and am even a proponent of these same citizens being legally able to carry a firearm for defensive purposes. In answer to the question that you posed...It depends on the circumstances of the incident. There is no simple answer to such a question. A violent encounter is a dynamic event that simply contains too many \"ifs\". Example: If the person with a firearm was very reasonably certain that no harm would come to the victim if he complied with the wishes of the perpetrator, it is generally better to do nothing other than be a good witness and relay information to law enforcement.\n \n If the person carry a gun has strong reason to believe that the situation will turn fatal, and he/she is in such a position that they are able to intervene in relative safety, the use of force may indeed be the better option. \n \n The only certainty in any such circumstance is that if a person decides, based on the circumstances, that the best course is to fight back, there are few weapons that afford the advantages of a firearm. In a study done by the FBI it was found that victims of crime that fought back with a handgun were less likely to be injured than those who utilized other means of defense. They were also less likely to be injured than those who did not resist in any way. I have the study here somewhere and will try to find it in the next few days if time permits.\n \n as to the original question...I lean towards law abiding citizens making a decision based on the circumstances, and then being held accountable for the decision they make. This is pretty much how our system is set up now, and I think that, for the most part, it is a system that allows for the best compromise between safety and accountability.\n \n \n JW",

   "Thanks, flyboy. Apologies for the wording of the question, I was trying to make it clear that the citizen knew very little about the situation - though I think I failed. The main idea I am attempting to defeat is NATO's implication that owning a gun would make one of the hotel guests into a 'hero of the day', rather than a (possibly/probably) failed vigilante - because the guests are not informed.\n \n Charliegone - with regards to self-defence - yes, there are some cases where a gun will be the only successful method for self-defence; and in a few cases within the Mumbai shootings it would probably have proved beneficial for an individual to own a gun which they were proficient with. The relevant question then is if those lives lost due to lack of guns are outweighed or not by all the preventable misuse of guns that have ended in loss of life. Personally, I think that this is the case (those surveys are fairly strong evidence of this - feel free to question them some more).\n Do you have any stats on the proportion of gun owners that are trained/proficient? I know that very few states require training/testing (and mainly only for CCW), but I have little idea how many people get trained elsewhere...\n \n Nato: I suspect this may take a little longer to answer...\n \nSo if a positive identification of the threat can be made, then you'd alright with somebody not of the military or police killing them?\n\n That's an awkward question. Firstly, it is a completely different scenario to the original one brought up - there are no 'heros' in this situation, just one-on-one. Secondly, the level of 'threat' is uncertain. At what point does killing become legitimate - somewhere from the individual firing through their door at trick and treaters to the person shooting the person charging at them with a knife, but where? More importantly, how do we make sure that that 'line' is not crossed?\n Ultimately, as I've said before, I don't have an issue with killing in self-defence (or the defence of others) in a last resort. However, as I've also said before, I don't think that the 'last resort' scenario is reached often enough to allow widespread gun ownership, because of the many many abuses of that ownership that outweigh the benefits.\n \n \nIf I have reason to believe that I'm likely to die regardless of what happens, then I'd much rather die trying to be a hero and actually do some good with the time I've got left, instead of cowering behind a piece of flimsy concealment hoping that my life would somehow be spared.\n\n Really? There were less than 200 killings in the entire period of the various sieges - given the situation, you've got a fairly high chance of survival. Certainly higher than if you actively go terrorist-hunting. Personally, I'd follow Charliegone out of the window.\n More seriously, you are still fixated on the idea that because you have a gun, you can become a hero. That's exactly the mentality that my Hollywood quote was aimed at - just because you have the means to save the day doesn't mean that you will.\n \n \nThat may be your attitude, however I haven't seen any proof that would support this. I haven't found any evidence supporting the idea that being unintentionally wounded by civilian gunfire is a real concern in states that allowed concealed carry.\n\n Wasn't there a recent event at a cinema...?\n \n I haven't seen any evidence supporting the idea that gun-toting vigilantes are saving people from criminals, either.\n \n \nI don't know what I'd prefer if I were a police officer, but speaking from my experience and how I feel right now, I'd much rather know that people aren't counting on me to get there in time to save their lives like some 1950s comic book superhero who always gets there in the nick of time.

The US already locks up almost 10% of it's population at any one time - that suggests to me that it's not the best system.\n \n \nYou do if you're physically inferior to your attacker, because no matter how you try and rationalize it, a lady in a wheelchair can't possibly hope to incapacitate her mugger through martial arts.\n \n If you run from a dog it'll pursue and maul you, running from a mugger will lead to worse because the mugger is capable of feeling a wider range of emotions and will hurt you out of spite.\n \n And what's the answer for people who can't run away, like those in a leg brace?\nThe mugger thing; no, most muggers will rationalise that you aren't worth the bother of chasing - especially if you're in a populated area (which is likely).\n As I've said above - in some cases guns could be handy (although in some cases mace and tasers would come in handy, too). That doesn't legitimise them, though.\n \n \nHow do you know he'd miss the shooter? How would he be more of a threat to the police?\nHe'd be more of a threat to the police (than an unarmed individual) because the more guns there are at a scene, the more they have to deal with. I don't know that he'd miss the shooter, but I would say it's likely, as you've stated he's untrained, and I've been repeatedly told by pro-gunners (in 'gun vs knife' arguments, generally) that a gun is not an easy thing to aim accurately. I've also found that from my own experience - air rifle, not gun, but it's a similar concept.\n \n \nYou know what? I simply don't care anymore.

Wasn't the rampaging bulldozer operator over in Israel killed by an armed civilian?\n \n It may seem like a long shot, but a single individual is able to make a lot of difference.\n \n \nCharliegone - with regards to self-defence - yes, there are some cases where a gun will be the only successful method for self-defence; and in a few cases within the Mumbai shootings it would probably have proved beneficial for an individual to own a gun which they were proficient with.

I know that very few states require training/testing (and mainly only for CCW), but I have little idea how many people get trained elsewhere...\n\n \n I feel the need to interject something here. Even if it can be proven that a gun ban can and will save lives, is the potential security that can be gained worth the loss of freedom that'll occur. Certain freedoms were provided by the founders of their respected nations for a reason, are we really supposed to be questioning whether it's right to have those freedoms?\n \n Somebody tells us that we can save lives by giving up a certain measuring of freedom, it sounds good. Somebody else says we can save more lives by giving up a little more. Following a trend like this you eventually have a police state, with security cameras monitoring your homes, travel logs listing where you go, when you go and for how long you're gone, and the police stopping you to see if you have authorization to be traveling through the neighborhood that you've just entered.\n \n At what point does the loss of recognized freedoms outweigh the potential security that you might get in exchange? At what point does the allowing of the government to micromanage just about every aspect of your life outweigh the possibility of not having to worry about being mugged or suffer a home invasion again?\n \n \nThat's an awkward question. Firstly, it is a completely different scenario to the original one brought up - there are no 'heros' in this situation, just one-on-one. Secondly, the level of 'threat' is uncertain. At what point does killing become legitimate - somewhere from the individual firing through their door at trick and treaters to the person shooting the person charging at them with a knife, but where? More importantly, how do we make sure that that 'line' is not crossed?\n\n \n Every state has a different standard on when deadly force becomes justified. In this state for example, deadly force is justified when a person reasonably believes that they're about the face imminent harm, danger, or a threat to their life or well being. This standard varies on a case by case situation and depends on the individual in question. If somebody's young, vital and very physically fit they might not feel in danger until a weapon is drawn. However it the person suffers from calcium deficiency and needs a walker to get around they might feel threatened when somebody is kicking their door. That's why we have a court system, to sort out the details involved.\n \n \nUltimately, as I've said before, I don't have an issue with killing in self-defence (or the defence of others) in a last resort. However, as I've also said before, I don't think that the 'last resort' scenario is reached often enough to allow widespread gun ownership, because of the many many abuses of that ownership that outweigh the benefits.\n\n \n Well let's cut through the meat and fat on this issue. What number would the occurrence of the \"last resort\" scenario have to be to justify widespread gun ownership to you? Are we talking round numbers per year like 5,000 or 10,000? Would it have to involve shots being fired or the gun simply being drawn and the scumbag being scared away? What're the relevant details for making a determination like this?\n \n \nReally? There were less than 200 killings in the entire period of the various sieges - given the situation, you've got a fairly high chance of survival. Certainly higher than if you actively go terrorist-hunting. Personally, I'd follow Charliegone out of the window.\n\n \n You might have a high chance of survival, but that doesn't mean you're guaranteed to live. Somebody's always getting killed when it hits the fan, and you have just as much chance as everyone around you as being killed.\n \n \nMore seriously, you are still fixated on the idea that because you have a gun, you can become a hero. That's exactly the mentality that my Hollywood quote was aimed at - just because you have the means to save the day doesn't mean that you will.\n\n \n I'll concede the point, what you say very well could be the case, I might not be able to make a difference and save anybody's life. But then again failure isn't a guaranteed outcome, I might just succeed and cut a bad incident short because I could make a difference. And even if it's a long shot, I'd much rather have the option open and possible, rather than discard it as not being worth consideration.\n \n \nWasn't there a recent event at a cinema...?\n\n \n The details are still coming in on that.\n \n \nI haven't seen any evidence supporting the idea that gun-toting vigilantes are saving people from criminals, either.\n\n \n When do gun owners qualify as vigilantes? And how? Historically vigilantes were a publicly hired substitute for lawmen, people who were obliged and expected to abide and uphold the written law when a designated sheriff couldn't be in the area for various reasons?\n \n \nAnd to me that suggests you have far too many guns.\n As I posted elsewhere, the US has the highest known incarceration rate in the world. The US already locks up almost 10% of it's population at any one time - that suggests to me that it's not the best system.\n\n \n Well if 10% of out population is locked up and there are still widespread crime issues, then it's likely that more than 10% of the population are criminal individuals.\n \n \nThe mugger thing; no, most muggers will rationalise that you aren't worth the bother of chasing - especially if you're in a populated area (which is likely).\n\n \n Well there are the cases where people are assaulted when in a public place. If you wouldn't call these random assaulters muggers then what would you call them? We've got muggers, rapists, carjackers, abusive exhusbands, etc. those that assault you in a public place have to be classified as something don't they?\n \n \nHe'd be more of a threat to the police (than an unarmed individual) because the more guns there are at a scene, the more they have to deal with.\n\n \n Police are trained to treat every situation as if someone is armed and potentially dangerous. They'd know how to handle the situation. And as you said about the speed limit thing, the focus of laws isn't to make the police safer or make things better for them.\n \n \nI don't know that he'd miss the shooter, but I would say it's likely, as you've stated he's untrained, and I've been repeatedly told by pro-gunners (in 'gun vs knife' arguments, generally) that a gun is not an easy thing to aim accurately. I've also found that from my own experience - air rifle, not gun, but it's a similar concept.\n\n \n Yes it's not easy to operate a gun accurately, but one of the qualifications for obtaining a concealed carry permit is to display some standard of accuracy. In this state you have to hit three targets 18 out of 25 times to pass. Five shots at three yards one handed, ten shots at seven yards two handed, and ten shots at ten yards two handed.\n \n And about the air rifle issue, that's something else entirely. Most air guns have a smooth bore barrel, like on a shotgun or a musket, and doesn't lend itself towards great accuracy.\n \n \nLike I said - you seem to not mind as long as you get to carry your gun. I will repeat myself. If the negative aspects outweigh the positive aspects, then something should be controlled.\n\n \n The negative aspects of using drugs greatly outweigh any positive aspects, but many people still call for the decriminalization of illegal drugs that're involved with one killing or another.\n \n \nSource? I had a brief look, but can't find it...\n\n \n I'll look for it.",
