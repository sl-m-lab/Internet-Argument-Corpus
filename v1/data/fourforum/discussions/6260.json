Further, bogus names have been spotted, such as the infamous Spice Girl parading as a Dr. Halliwell, Perry Mason, etc. \n\n \n Sourcewatch (which I have my suspicions about, but will leave them out of the discussion) put together the following page:\n http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Oregon_Institute_of_Science_and_Medicine\n \n In it, it says the following about the petition\"\n \n\n Case Study: The Oregon Petition \n The Oregon Petition, sponsored by the OISM, was circulated in April 1998 in a bulk mailing to tens of thousands of U.S. scientists. In addition to the petition, the mailing included what appeared to be a reprint of a scientific paper. Authored by OISM's Arthur B. Robinson, Sallie L. Baliunas, Willie Soon, and Zachary W. Robinson, the paper was titled \"Environmental Effects of Increased Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide\" and was printed in the same typeface and format as the official Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Also included was a reprint of a December 1997, Wall Street Journal editorial, \"Science Has Spoken: Global Warming Is a Myth, by Arthur and Zachary Robinson. A cover note signed \"Frederick Seitz/Past President, National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A./President Emeritus, Rockefeller University\", may have given some persons the impression that Robinson's paper was an official publication of the academy's peer-reviewed journal. The blatant editorializing in the pseudopaper, however, was uncharacteristic of scientific papers.\n\n \n Further in the page it talks abot the 15,000 signatures being obtained in ~ a month. Then, they placed the petition online and environmentalists began signing it under false names.\n \n\n Notwithstanding this rebuke, the Oregon Petition managed to garner 15,000 signatures within a month's time. S. Fred Singer called the petition \"the latest and largest effort by rank-and-file scientists to express their opposition to schemes that subvert science for the sake of a political agenda.\" \n \n Nebraska senator Chuck Hagel called it an \"extraordinary response\" and cited it as his basis for continuing to oppose a global warming treaty. \"Nearly all of these 15,000 scientists have technical training suitable for evaluating climate research data,\" Hagel said. Columns citing the Seitz petition and the Robinson paper as credible sources of scientific expertise on the global warming issue have appeared in publications ranging from Newsday', the Los Angeles Times and Washington Post to the Austin-American Statesman, Denver Post, and Wyoming Tribune-Eagle. \n \n In addition to the bulk mailing, OISM's website enables people to add their names to the petition over the Internet, and by June 2000 it claimed to have recruited more than 19,000 scientists. The institute is so lax about screening names, however, that virtually anyone can sign, including for example Al Caruba, a pesticide-industry PR man and conservative ideologue who runs his own website called the \"National Anxiety Center.\" Caruba has no scientific credentials whatsoever, but in addition to signing the Oregon Petition he has editorialized on his own website against the science of global warming, calling it the \"biggest hoax of the decade,\" a \"genocidal\" campaign by environmentalists who believe that \"humanity must be destroyed to 'Save the Earth.' . . . There is no global warming, but there is a global political agenda, comparable to the failed Soviet Union experiment with Communism, being orchestrated by the United Nations, supported by its many Green NGOs, to impose international treaties of every description that would turn the institution into a global government, superceding the sovereignty of every nation in the world.\" \n When questioned in 1998, OISM's Arthur Robinson admitted that only 2,100 signers of the Oregon Petition had identified themselves as physicists, geophysicists, climatologists, or meteorologists, \"and of those the greatest number are physicists.\" This grouping of fields concealed the fact that only a few dozen, at most, of the signatories were drawn from the core disciplines of climate science - such as meteorology, oceanography, and glaciology - and almost none were climate specialists. The names of the signers are available on the OISM's website, but without listing any institutional affiliations or even city of residence, making it very difficult to determine their credentials or even whether they exist at all. When the Oregon Petition first circulated, in fact, environmental activists successfully added the names of several fictional characters and celebrities to the list, including John Grisham, Michael J. Fox, Drs. Frank Burns, B. J. Honeycutt, and Benjamin Pierce (from the TV show M*A*S*H), an individual by the name of \"Dr. Red Wine,\" and Geraldine Halliwell, formerly known as pop singer Ginger Spice of the Spice Girls. Halliwell's field of scientific specialization was listed as \"biology.\"  Even in 2003, the list was loaded with misspellings, duplications, name and title fragments, and names of non-persons, such as company names. \n \n\n \n \n\n Finally, it's maybe no more than an appeal to authority. I don't think I'd use the petition in a debate, it has a bad provenance and has the potential to derail your train going full steam.\n\n \n I didn't use it as a centerpiece of my position. I used it to derail any claim that \"there is a general agreement amongst the scienticic community that global warming is real and man-made\". It was a pre-emptive strike. :)",

After seeing Clive14's first post, I thought I was battling a lightweight and reacted accordingly. I, typically only spent a couple of hours on my posts because I didn't see the outcome as being in question. \n It was relatively easy for me to rebut all of his points, especially the beneficial effects of CO2 on plant growth. That was a softball argument. emoticon_wow \n Now that the debate is done and settled, I'll post what would have been my fourth post. Hopefully, the link between \"chicken little\" and \"show me da money\" will be convincing enough to tie my distruct of the UN and its scientists with the global warming hoax together.",

   "We know that we have been releasing large quantities of CO2 above normal levels. We know that CO2 is currently at high levels and increasing in the atmosphere (more particularly increasing at a very high rate, CO2 was higher approx 650000 years ago IIRC, the rate of change is vital, however). We know the link between CO2 and global warming. How much more evidence is needed? The fact that you maintain the fantasy that the world could be as little as 10k years old shows how little grasp you have on the situation.\n\n \n I've already debated global warming once. Would you care to become victim #2?emoticon_xgood \n CO2 only accounts for a few % of the atmospheric greenhouse gases. H2O vapor accounts for <95%, should we stop showering with hot water, too?:)",

   "If my recollection is correct, the atmosphere is approx 80% Nitrogen. \n \n Actually, I've just had a check and water vapour makes up between 0 and 4% of the atmosphere, Nitrogen 78%, Oxygen 21%. CO2 is very low, but that is rather irrelevant as it is percentage change, and the rate of that change, that is important. It's rather like air pressure. If you go straight from 1000mB to 400mB, you will do yourself a mischief. If you go gradually from one to the other, you should be alright. If you go down to 200mB, after a couple of minutes you're pretty much dead whatever happens.",

There are lots of others.\n \n http://www.envirotruth.org/myth3.cfm\n\n \n \n The problem is that taking CO2 and water vapour as bare percentages of the atmosphere doesn't account for the spectra of light which they absorb. In simple terms, the Sun emits radiation in a broad spectrum, which is partly reflected back by the earth, partly absorbed and re-emited. Greenhouse gases have energy levels such that the frequencies of radiation emitted by the earth are similar to those required to raise an electron up an energy level. Some greenhouse gases block more of this spectrum than others.",
