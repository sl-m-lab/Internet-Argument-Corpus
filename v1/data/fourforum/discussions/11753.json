   "It just occurred to me that this Public Service Announcement needs a permanent place in the Abortion Forum so that sincere people of good conscience can refer back to it from time to time as a reminder of what we are dealing with in attempting to reason with unreasonable people, as we debate abortion as it currently exists in America. \n \n This PSA explains the irrational attempts by the extreme left to justify their pro-death philosophy which they so fervently defend as they endorse the unchecked murders of the very weakest and voiceless segment among us.\n \n A PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT:\n \n THE PRO-ABORTION AGENDA OF JUSTIFICATION THROUGH DEHUMANIZATION\n \n To those people who are attempting to rationally debate the issue of ABORTION with these pro-death secular humanists and atheists, it is very important that you understand their true agenda and modus operandi for justifying the procedure which murders unborn babies while still in their mothers wombs.\n \n The method for justification requires that they dehumanize the unborn children which is why they will refer to them as ZEFs and Zygotes. And is why they will use comparisons to the fertilized and unfertilized chicken egg, which we eat for breakfast. You see, either way, when debating this issue on such a simplistic level, they win by default because they have already lowered the standard of debate to that of a chicken egg.\n \n So, by just understanding the shallowness of their tactics, we win by not allowing them to dehumanize our human offspring to the status of an inhuman analogy. Remember that these people are attempting to justify the murder of our very own human offspring. And they realize that as well as you and I do. What they must do is both justify their stance and maintain a clear conscience so they don't have to live with the guilt that they are in fact defenders of a pro murder philosophy.\n \n That is why no matter what common sense arguments you use with them, no matter how obvious and rational your reasoning, they will never accept or concede that their position is not only false and irrational, but is criminal and a pro-death philosophy which supports and encourages genocide. After all, it is painfully obvious that any doctrine which not only encourages, but enables the killing of 1.4 million members of one particular class of American consistently, year after year, can be described as nothing other than \"genocide\".\n \n That is why they must dehumanize the unborn, because they don't want to admit that they are proponents of the Great American Genocide. So forgive them for their irrational debating style which results in them offering the most infantile and ignorant arguments in their attempts to justify their sociopathic and shortsighted gospel of death and destruction of our most innocent and silent demographic, who have no personal voice of their own with which to defend themselves. \n \n What better a group to victimize than the absolute weakest among us? And they are even out of sight, so also out of mind of the masses. If they can only be dehumanized, then justifying their extermination should be easy according to the proponents of this MULTI BILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL INDUSTRY. So by understanding the rationale of these opponents of life for the unborn, you are more prepared to deal with the ignorance and shallowness of their inane attempts to justify such human carnage on such a massive scale. \n \n Just understand that these proponents of ABORTION are also victims since they have been raised in a selfish and self centered Society to believe that personal responsibility is a thing of the past, so demanding that the innocent child pay with its very life, the price for the sins of its mother/parents is just fine. And if they can moralize it by dehumanizing the baby so they can feel as though it is justified, then all the better. ",

   "Your continued repetitions of your claim do nothing to prove it. Furthermore, my refutations of your claim (evidenced by my knowledge of own tactics) still stand - simply repeating your position gets you no further, even if you say 'this is true' after it. Seealso: my first post in this thread.\n \n As to 'dehumanise the unborn' - that's circular reasoning. You can only 'dehumanise the unborn' if the unborn are people in the first place - as I don't consider this to be the case, I'm not 'dehumanising'. I could equally accuse all 'anti-choicers' (to parody your (mis)characterisation) of 'personifying cells'; it works both ways.\n\n \n This very post of yours ^ proves my point perfectly since you repeat your bogus claim that the unborn are in fact non persons who deserve no rights or protections at all. In addition to that obvious fact, the reason my quoted post is self evident is because every pro abortion advocate here knows that this has been the SOP all along of their defense for abortion as a multi billion dollar annual industry in America, alone. \n \n This PSA is spot on and needs to be held up as the widely accepted method for defending the culture of death which abortion represents. Sorry if that label offends you, but you have directly proven my point with your own posted response. You see, I knew it was only a matter of time before you reverted to it since it is always the general fall back position for justifying the murder of our voiceless unborn for the sake of the woman's convenience fully 98% of the time.\n \n \nIt just occurred to me that this Public Service Announcement needs a permanent place in the Abortion Forum so that sincere people of good conscience can refer back to it from time to time as a reminder of what we are dealing with in attempting to reason with unreasonable people, as we debate abortion as it currently exists in America. \n \n This PSA explains the irrational attempts by the extreme left to justify their pro-death philosophy which they so fervently defend as they endorse the unchecked murders of the very weakest and voiceless segment among us.\n \n A PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT:\n \n THE PRO-ABORTION AGENDA OF JUSTIFICATION THROUGH DEHUMANIZATION\n \n To those people who are attempting to rationally debate the issue of ABORTION with these pro-death secular humanists and atheists, it is very important that you understand their true agenda and modus operandi for justifying the procedure which murders unborn babies while still in their mothers wombs.\n \n The method for justification requires that they dehumanize the unborn children which is why they will refer to them as ZEFs and Zygotes. And is why they will use comparisons to the fertilized and unfertilized chicken egg, which we eat for breakfast. You see, either way, when debating this issue on such a simplistic level, they win by default because they have already lowered the standard of debate to that of a chicken egg.\n \n So, by just understanding the shallowness of their tactics, we win by not allowing them to dehumanize our human offspring to the status of an inhuman analogy. Remember that these people are attempting to justify the murder of our very own human offspring. And they realize that as well as you and I do. What they must do is both justify their stance and maintain a clear conscience so they don't have to live with the guilt that they are in fact defenders of a pro murder philosophy.\n \n That is why no matter what common sense arguments you use with them, no matter how obvious and rational your reasoning, they will never accept or concede that their position is not only false and irrational, but is criminal and a pro-death philosophy which supports and encourages genocide. After all, it is painfully obvious that any doctrine which not only encourages, but enables the killing of 1.4 million members of one particular class of American consistently, year after year, can be described as nothing other than \"genocide\".\n \n That is why they must dehumanize the unborn, because they don't want to admit that they are proponents of the Great American Genocide. So forgive them for their irrational debating style which results in them offering the most infantile and ignorant arguments in their attempts to justify their sociopathic and shortsighted gospel of death and destruction of our most innocent and silent demographic, who have no personal voice of their own with which to defend themselves. \n \n What better a group to victimize than the absolute weakest among us? And they are even out of sight, so also out of mind of the masses. If they can only be dehumanized, then justifying their extermination should be easy according to the proponents of this MULTI BILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL INDUSTRY. So by understanding the rationale of these opponents of life for the unborn, you are more prepared to deal with the ignorance and shallowness of their inane attempts to justify such human carnage on such a massive scale. \n \n Just understand that these proponents of ABORTION are also victims since they have been raised in a selfish and self centered Society to believe that personal responsibility is a thing of the past, so demanding that the innocent child pay with its very life, the price for the sins of its mother/parents is just fine. And if they can moralize it by dehumanizing the baby so they can feel as though it is justified, then all the better. \n",

You seem to think that you can pick and choose what is true for you in life. You think that if you decide that, in this case, that the unborn aren't yet human since they are undeveloped below a level which you think justifies being respected as sentient life, so in your mind that justifies such a belief. Well, you should learn now or you will ultimately learn, I assure you that you are NOT the arbiter of truth in time and space. There are absolute truths in time and space which you are neither the arbiter of, nor do you determine such truths. You are as subservient to those absolute truths as you are to Gravity.\n \n Likewise, you and your ilk will deny that God exists and because you choose to believe that, you are self deluded enough to imagine, and you are imagining iangb, that because you choose to think that the Creator God doesn't exist, then that must mean He doesn't exist. So you see my ignorant friend, just because you choose not to believe that children are sentient beings or that God is real and created everything that is, that self delusion has nothing at all to do with the reality that these truths are self evident and eternal since they have been spoken to be by the living God Himself.\n \n \nAs I've said, simply saying that 'my claim is bogus' does not make it so - and seeing as your whole OP is delivered in the context of that idea, your whole post is equally unproven/irrelevant - repeating yourself won't change that fact.\n\n \n Actually it does make it so, since you can search every abortion debate ever had on this or any forum and the prevailing argument by the pro-abortionist is the nullification of human rights by the unborn because they aren't sentient human beings yet. You must deny their humanity in order to ease your consciences as flaming liberals since you are condoning, endorsing and defending the murders of more than a million real human beings each year in the USA alone. \n \n What it comes down to iangb, is that you secularists will lie to yourselves as needed in order to convince yourselves that what you're doing isn't mass genocide of the most innocent and defenseless class of people among us. So continue to lie to yourself if it gets you through the day, iangb. Convince yourself that you can pick and choose what is absolute truth in this life too, and see how far that gets you.

And yes, they did occur and were widely practiced by the pagans of the time, but why do you attempt to say that because they were practiced by sinners that means they were right or good for the people or the society? Obviously Paul didn't think this or he wouldn't have warned against such practices just as we modern christians maintain those same warnings which you continue to argue against.\n We will begin this morning with a quiz: Name this city and time: The city has about 650,000 people, it is a major commercial center and a center of legal activity; it has pretensions to be a major intellectual center. It is also a center of immorality, and its name itself has become associated with immorality. It was rebuilt after a disaster a little less than 100 years before this time, and after that rebuilding became one of the most important cities in the region. We might summarize this description by saying this city is intellectually astute, financially prosperous, and morally corrupt.\n \n What is the city and time? Miami? San Francisco? It sounds much like many places in this country today, doesn't it? But this city is Corinth at the time of Paul. Corinth was in a natural location for a commercial center. Remember the shape of Greece: there is a very narrow land bridge connecting the southern part of Greece -- the Peloponnessus -- with the northern part of Greece. This land bridge is only 4-7 miles wide. Corinth was situated right at the southern part of that land bridge. Any commercial land traffic going between northern and southern Greece had to go thru Corinth. Similarly, at that time there were ports on the eastern and western sides of that land bridge, and ships would come to one of those parts. Small ships would actually be dragged on rollers, up about 1000 feet on one side, then down 1000 feet on the other, and then continue in the water on the other side. Larger ships would be offloaded; the cargo would be carried across the land bridge, and loaded on a new ship in the other port. This would be done because the southern point of Greece was dangerous for ships; shipping agents preferred not to send their ships all the way around that point, but rather to go through Corinth. This made Corinth the most important commercial center in the region. Corinth had been destroyed by the Romans in the 140's BC because Corinth had been a leader in a Greek rebellion against Roman authority, but Julius Caesar rebuilt the city as a Roman colony in 46 BC, and it had prospered greatly after that time, quickly becoming one of the largest cities in the world. By the way, it was much bigger then than now -- the present city of Corinth has a population of only about 50,000. But the city at that time was large and prosperous.1st Century Corinth, USA: A Sermon on Acts 18",

   "Once again literalism at its finest... The term \"homosexual\" was not even created till the late 19th century.... Try again Archie...\n\n \n Rather than play your typical game of semantics in order to justify your rebellion against God, read this excerpt from the above posted link:\n Let's begin with the first of these: 1 Corinthians 6, the end of 19 and the beginning of 20: \"You are not your own; you were bought at a price.\" We can get some idea concerning what Paul was preaching in Corinth by looking at the letter to the Galatians. We don't know exactly when Galatians was written, but quite likely it was written about this time, possibly even while Paul was in Corinth. And in the letter to the Galatians Paul is particularly concerned to make clear to them that they are free in Christ, that you do not need to do anything to be saved, that we have complete freedom. Many of the Corinthians seem to have learned this lesson quite well. Paul says in Galatians 5:1 \"It is for freedom that Christ has set us free.\" In 5:13 \"You my brothers were called to be free.\" And so Paul, quoting the Corinthians' letter to him, says 4 times in the book of 1 Corinthians, \"Everything is permissible to me.\" This was the lesson that the Corinthians had learned from Paul. So they were throwing this back at him, saying \"Everything is permissible for me, therefore --\" and drawing some conclusions from that. One of the \"therefores\" was: \"Sexual immorality doesn't matter. If I have complete freedom in Christ, I can do whatever I want.\" Another application was \"Everything is permissible to me, so it doesn't matter if what I do hurts someone else. We have complete freedom in Christ! We can behave as we wish.\"\n \n Well, is everything permissible for us? We do have complete freedom in Christ -- that is important to remember, not to allow ourselves to get back under the yoke of slavery of trying to live up to a law, as Paul talks about in Galatians. But let's read all of 1 Corinthians 6:19-20. Paul is talking about sexual immorality, but the application is much broader than that:\n \n Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore, glorify God with your body.\n \n The key here is seeing that Christian morality does not consist of defining what sin is, and then getting as close to sin as possible without crossing the line. That is not Christian morality. Nor does Christian morality consist of broadening the concept of sin to include lots of things that are not sin, and then avoiding those things. That is not Christian morality.\n \n Let me give you an example from our home. We will call this particular child in our house \"George\" to maintain anonymity. There was chaos in our home -- that is not too unusual -- some children were singing, others were talking, it was rather loud and cacophonous, and one of the two parents said, \"ENOUGH! No more singing!\" So this particular child, George, went,\" Hmmm, mmm, hmmm-hmmm hmmm.\" We said, \"George, we just told you to stop that!\" And of course the reply was: \"I'm not singing! I'm humming!\"\n \n Christian morality does not consist of making a distinction between singing and humming and then hum when you are told not to sing. What is Christian morality? It is striving for the good, not avoiding evil. It is becoming Christlike, not trying to see how close we can get to being immoral without doing so. As soon as we have an attitude of \"Let's see how close I can get to sin without falling into it\" we have already sinned. And the point that Paul is making here, \"You are not your own, you were bought at a price,\" is, \"Yes, we were purchased by God to be free -- but at the same time he is the purchaser, and we have a choice: we can either be slaves to sin, or we can be slaves to God. We can choose to be slaves to God, we can freely make that decision to be God's slave.\" Peter brings this out in one of my favorite verses in the Bible -- one of these days I'm going to preach a series on the paradoxical verses in the Bible -- and this is one of those verses. 1 Peter 2:16 \"Live as free men -- Live as free men, but don't use your freedom as a cover-up for doing evil; live as God's slaves.\" In the same verse he brings these two thoughts together: \"Live as free men -- Live as God's slave.\" We are the body of Christ; we are called by him to do his work in the world. We can voluntarily act as his slaves. The alternative -- this licentious attitude displayed by the Corinthians -- is to put ourselves back under this yoke of slavery to sin. So whose slave are you?\n This explains what it means to be a true follower of Christ. If you knew Him you would understand this.",

   "I find it humorous that you two feel qualified to make value judgements about someone you have never personally met. Yet based on our moral value system and faith in God, you perceive that we are lacking in rational or considered evaluations of the personal relationship we and millions of others insist we share with Him. Sadly, rather than have the wisdom to question your own lack of spiritual insight, you prefer to believe we have been brainwashed, or even more incredibly that we are afraid to admit the truth. \n \n What I want to know from you two lost souls is exactly what is this truth according to your infantile perceptions. I'm willing to bet that I get no straight forward or direct answer to this question since neither of you can see past your puny and shallow existences and have no idea where you came from or where you're going.\n\n \n And yet your the expert Mr. I know God's mind down to the moment? I find it humorous that you actually THINK your stance or mindset relative if not sane which it clearly is not!\n \n And how am I lost Arch? Are you wearing a morality badge too? Of course you are because the ONLY way you feel vindicated in your shallow faith is to judge others by the length of your own nose....",

And what if he was a Christian and like me, rebuked your preaching methods you narrow minded fool?\n \n Why don't you look in the mirror before opening your mouth and rebuking people you hardly have any idea about?\n\n \n Why don't you give up your illicit gay sex debauchery and repent like you should be doing? \n \n Oh, I forgot. Gay-sex homosexuals don't repent. They refuse to because gay sex is their idol / god. They just flaunt, defend, and promote their ungodly vice and mock and attack Biblical believers.",
