   "Who else?\n \n Sarah Palin! Of course!\n \nThe crowd apparently went nuts at this. Palin has figured out that this is really all you have to do to win elections in this country - flatter middle Americans' moronic fantasies about themselves. The great thing about flattery is a) you can't overdo it as hard as you try, and b) it doesn't pin you down to messy political positions, controversies, things you can be harassed about by Chris Matthews and other press weasels.\n \n It's basically a risk-free strategy. You get up on stage and you basically say, \"I'm just like all you XXXXXX. And you XXXXXX rock!\" People will actually fall for this stuff. The ingenious part in Sarah Palin's case is that she probably genuinely believes it.\n \n She one-ups even George Bush in this respect. Bush was sincere in his respect for the citizen's right to craft important opinions about the world while drinking beer and watching baseball, and that came across in his speeches - it was a big reason for his success.\n \n But Bush couldn't have spent more than ten minutes in some dirty trailer in Arkansas before signaling for the helicopter. The guy was just too used to being around rich people, nice houses, cigarette boats full of sheiks and oil executives, etc. Sarah Palin on the other hand really is the kind of person who you can picture eating egg salad off a ping-pong table. That and her utterly genuine stupidity and meanness can take her a long way - all by themselves, I think these things can win the White House for her - and it seems like she senses this on some animal/reptilian level. Hence the renewed emphasis on jacking off her audiences of late.\n\n Matt Taibbi in True Slant:\n I, Sarah Palin, Goes Redneck - Matt Taibbi - Taibblog - True/Slant\n \n Gawd! I love the way Matt Taibbi writes!\n \n And XXXXX equals \"moronic person.\"",
