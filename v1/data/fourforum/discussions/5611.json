   "And here I thought laughter was supposed to be good for one's health. I guess too much of a good thing is bad.\n =========================\n Thursday, June 09, 2005\n Man Reads Entire EU Constitution, Dies Of Laughter\n 6/8/2005 - Matt Myford\n \n An Ohio man died yesterday after downloading the proposed European Union constitution off the internet and \"reading the ghastly document in its entirety,\" according to state police in Columbus. The man died of \"raging fits of laughter,\" police said. The man, whose identity is being withheld until his family is notified, is believed to be the first person to actually read the entire EU constitution. A leaked autopsy report said that human beings can \"be subjected to only so many asininities\" before \"paralysis and even death can occur.\"...\n \n (Snip)\n \n Ohio state police issued a warning to \"anyone considering reading this monstrosity, this ode to bureaucracy.\" Officials remarked that the constitution is \"beyond satire-proof...a document so saturated with gobbledygook we can safely say it's the official text of the post-post-postmodern era.\"\n \n (Snip)\n \n \"These EU elites can't write a constitution if their lives depended on it,\" said one U.S. political analyst. \"But they're so damn funny - without even realizing it - they may be able to find work as writers on Letterman's show or something.\" \n \n http://www.brokennewz.com/displaystory.asp_Q_storyid_E_1262euconst",
