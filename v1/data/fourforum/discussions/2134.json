   "My main question in the gun control debate is this-\n Why do I have to feel unsafe, just so you can feel safe?\n\n \n Your question makes me pause. I find it interesting that you assign the cause of your unsafe \"feeling\" on those who pose no threat to your safety. \n \n While Americans have a relatively high per-capita rate of firearms ownership the vast majority of those guns stay in citizen's homes. How those guns locked away in someone's bedroom or basement or closet make you feel unsafe is something you will need to elaborate on. \n \n Very few citizens actually leave their homes armed and conduct themselves in public with a gun and those that do are complying with a myriad of laws controlling their actions and requiring licenses and permits. \n \n By and large it is only criminals and law enforcement who go about their public business armed. While I could comprehend a fear of law enforcement threatening your safety I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume that you are not a wanted criminal and that is not the basis of your fear for your safety. \n \n Now that leaves criminals . . . But you are not focused on them either because the premise of your question is that new restrictions on ownership and use of guns will finally make you feel safe . . . Ergo, the class of people who make you feel unsafe are the class of people who would comply with your desired restrictions on the ownership and use of firearms . . . I know you are not so naive to believe that criminals would follow such restrictions.\n \n So what are we left to conclude? Do you really feel more fear for your safety from regular citizens than from criminals?",
