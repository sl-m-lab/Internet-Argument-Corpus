What a resounding reply to an interesting question so far.\n \n I've been thinking about the question. I guess it depends on the definition of a fossil. My dictionary of modern biology says that a fossil is \"the preserved remains of, or impressions left by, organisms that lived prior to the end of the last glacial period (about 10,000 years ago).\"\n \n By that definition, even the frozen organic remains of the mammoths from above the Arctic circle are fossils. So would the bones the Neandertals from which DNA was extracted be fossils even though they weren't mineralized. Normally I think of fossilization as the replacement of the organic structure with minerals, but that isn't true all of the time.\n \n And I think that presents a problem for creationists who wish to claim that all fossils were created by the flood. How is it that the bones of dinosaurs are always mineralized to the point that only a few molecules of organic material have ever been recovered from such fossils, while Neandertal and Cro-Magnon remains haven't been mineralized at all. I think creationists need to explain why there is a difference.",

That is because creationists are living in the past. It was originally Christian scientists who recognized that the fossil record changed as one went deeper. These scientists assigned relative ages to types of fossils by how deep they were found. For example, certain brachiopods were always found at certain levels, always in a certain sequence with other fossils and in a specific sequence with other brachiopods. These Christian geologists assigned names to the various geologic strata and they learned to identify these strata around the world by the fossils that they contained. These fossils were called index fossils. But they didn't know how old they were. They were only able to assign relative ages - the suite of Devonian fossils were found deeper than the suite of Permian fossils wherever they were found, and thus they were older.\n \n Contrast this with the creationist viewpoint - Devonian bivalves weren't able to run as fast as Permian bivalves and were trapped in lower layers in the FLUD.\n \n With the understanding of nuclear physics in the last century came the realization that certain types of rock could be dated by a variety of measures of radioactive elements. There are several methods of measuring ratios of radioactive elements to daughter products. Where more than one method can be used, they have been found to yield similar ages. These are, for the most part, volcanic rocks. Reducing the rock to lava resets all of the radiometric elements. Thus, the measure is the last time that the volcanic rock was molten - the geologic term is \"closure\" and various radiometric methods have different temperatures of closure.\n \n So in the 20th century, the assumptions about the relative age of various fossil suites developed by Christian scientists were tested. The relative ages were found to be correct. The only flaw was that the ages were found to be much older than imagined. However, the relative age concept held up such that various strata can be dated by the type of index fossil that they contain. The difference is that now we have a better concept of actual age.\n \n Thus, if you find a fossil that you can positively identify as a theropod dinosaur, you can assume that it is older than 65 million years. If you can show otherwise, then you will turn the world of paleontology upside down. Such a find would make you famous, earn you millions, and cause such excitement in the science of paleontology that hasn't been seen for decades.\n \nSince you mention the Neanderthal DNA --- This DNA is found to be (in amount of genetic information) about half way between Man and Chimp.\n\n No it wasn't. What sort of rag have you been reading? There was no nuclear DNA found. The DNA was mtDNA. There have been three successful sequencing of Neandertal mtDNA of the same segment. They were all consistant, even though separated by place and a great deal of time. Analysis of human mtDNA indicates that Neandertals are not ancestral to modern humans. However, a claim that the sequencing showed that Neandertals were \"half way\" between chimp and human borders on idiocy.\n \nSo this eliminates Neanderthal from being an ancestor to homo sapiens.......do you have any idea of the implications of this?\n\n Yes I do. I wonder if you do. Neandertals aren't claimed to be ancestors of Homo sapiens. They are generally considered to be a separate species descended from a common ancestor. No one except uninformed creationists makes any claim that Neandertals are ancestral to modern humans.\n \nBONUS - According to the reigning opinion, in line with the 'Theory of Evolution': How did Bats come to live in New Zealand?\n\n I thought we were talking about evolution and you bring up a question about biogeography. So let me ask you, how did all of the animals get to the ark from New Zealand, Australia, North America, South America such that there is no trace of them going there? And how did they get back? I mean there are no kangaroo fossils anywhere but Australia. The only place in the world that one can find kiwi fossils is in New Zealand - and that is the only place where kiwis exist. How did they get to the ark and how did they get back?\n \n I can also ask how Mexican free-tailed bats came to live in North America? Certainly they couldn't have crossed the Atlantic. And yet every evening from March to November about 1.5 million Mexican free-tailed bats fly from under the Congress Avenue bridge in Austin, Texas. There are no fossils of these bats around Mt. Ararat or anywhere in between. They only exist in northern Mexico and southern United States. How did they get here?\n \n In fact, since you asked the question, how exactly did New Zealand bats get to New Zealand from the ark? I'm sure that you have an answer.",

Therefore, when a geologic formation or strata is being studied, the fossils contained in it will give a first estimate of the age of that formation. In some cases, I believe, radiometric dating is not possible, so the ages of the fossils contained therein are the only estimates available for the age of the unit. Some species occur in such a narrow age range but are almost ubiquitous in the geologic units of that age that they are given the name \"index fossils\" because of their use in dating.\n \n It occassionally happens that a new find is dated, and the dates, when verified, will extend the time-range of a certain species.

   "Darwin wrote a lot of books. Your quote doesn't come from the logical place, On the Origin of Species.\n \n Darwin proposed the theory of natural selection. As his ideas became popular, other scientists saw action of similar mechanisms in their field. One was Herbert Spencer. Spencer was a social philosopher. He developed a theory that applied to the viability of cultures, wherein the weak were diminished and their cultures delimited, while the strong grew in power and in cultural influence over the weak. In describing this he called it \"survival of the fittest.\" As time passed, the ideas became confused among the common people. Spencer's term was commonly applied to Darwin's theory. This was probably multiplied by the fact that Spencer also used the term, \"natural selection\" to refer to his social theory. Eventually, Spencer's theory became known as social Darwinism.\n \n Spencer's term became so popular that it was more frequently used to refer to Darwin's theory among the common people than Darwin's preferred term. As a result, Darwin was convinced by Alfred Wallace as a matter of convenience to also use the \"survival of the fittest\" along with his own term of natural selection. He first used \"survival of the fittest\" in the 4th edition of Origin. He may have used it in some other paper that he published between the 3rd and 4th editions.\n \n So where did you get the quote? What book is it from so that I might put it into context?",

   "Hi Guys,\n My 2p worth. First let me say I am a christian and have a strong relationship with God through Jesus Christ. However that does not mean I am a recent creationist. The reason is common sense.\n Having studied geology at college and seeing episodes of geological activity rather than a single event that laid done all geological features seems to me pretty clear. One can measure erosion rates, sea floor spreading and of course as brought up earlier in this thread, rocks can be dated to be the same age simply by the same fossils appearing in them. This is very clear when looking at Amonites in the Jurassic deposits so clearly seen near Lyme Regis, Dorset England. You can see a whole sequence of different species appearing and dissappearing followed by new species all the way up right into the chalk of the Cretaceous, but never reappearing..\n Follow that with tilting and folding coupled with uplift and erosion, that takes more than 4,500 years..\n The basic problem I see for the recent creationist is in the literal interpretation of genesis chapter 1. This was written as a poem (it even rhymes in its original language) as a way of remembering to keep God's Sabbath (day of rest). For me its not a \"useless text\" but a way to remind me how God brought things about. Genesis 1 is about literacy, not literally. How else would 'lights' preceed the creation of stars and the Sun? Taking another part of the bible from revelation, how would one interpret \"..a third of the stars fell to the earth..\"? \n Personally for me, the debate on Creation V evolution is a wasted one, because even though God is the creator of the world and universe we see today and science the way of finding out what happened, the true task of the Christian including me is by proclaiming God's salvation and Kingdom in our lives.",
