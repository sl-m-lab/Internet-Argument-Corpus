   "The correct one....This has been posted about a dozen times atleast\n\n http://www.myjewishlearning.com/ideas_belief/bioethics/Bioethics_Abortion_TO_2.htm\n \n \nThe Jewish discussion about abortion begins with a biblical text. Exodus 21:22-23 discusses a situation in which two men are fighting. During the fight, one of the men accidentally hits a pregnant woman. The Torah says that if the woman is killed then, \"a nefesh shall be given for a nefesh (a life shall be given for a life).\" The man who struck her is considered a murderer and is punished accordingly. If, however, the woman miscarries but does not die, the man must pay monetary damages. He is not liable for murder because the fetus is not considered a nefesh, a human being.\n \n \n \n While establishing the status of a fetus, this text tells us nothing about the permissibility of abortion. It is another source-the Mishnah (redacted c. 200 CE), in Tractate Ohalot-that provides us with the underlying principle: \"If a woman is undergoing a perilous pregnancy, the fetus may be destroyed since her life takes precedence over its life.\" When a woman's life is in danger, abortion is permitted. However, the range of this permissibility is subject to debate and hinges on a single question: Why does the woman's life take precedence over the fetus?\n \n \n \n The medieval commentator Rashi (1040-1105 CE) interprets this mishnah in terms of the verses from Exodus cited above. Accordingly, the woman's life takes precedence over the fetus because the fetus does not have the status of a nefesh, a human being. Maimonides (1135-1204), on the other hand, believes that aborting the fetus is permissible because the fetus is considered a rodef, one who \"pursues\" another with the intent to kill. According to Jewish law, it is permissible to kill a rodef in order to preempt his act of murder. Because in this case the fetus threatens the life of the pregnant woman, it is permissible to abort it. These two interpretations yield the same result for this specific case-the fetus is aborted and the woman is saved-but they serve as the basis for two differing approaches to abortion in general.\n \n \n \n As we have seen, if a woman's life is in danger it is permissible-in fact, obligatory-to terminate her pregnancy. But what about cases where the danger is of another sort? For example, a woman can suffer psychological harm by bringing to term a child who is the product of rape or who suffers from a genetic disorder. Is this psychological harm sufficient to warrant an abortion?\n \n \n \n Rashi's belief that the fetus is not considered a human life is the basis for the position that, in certain circumstances, psychological damage is sufficient danger to permit abortion. Eliezer Waldenberg employs this reasoning in allowing abortions for fetuses carrying Tay Sachs, a terminal genetic disease common to Ashkenazic Jews. Those who rely upon Maimonides' interpretation, however, do not focus on the non-human status of the fetus. They allow abortion only when the fetus threatens the life of the mother. When the fetus is not life threatening-even if it threatens the woman in other ways-abortion is not permitted. This was the position taken by the former chief rabbi of Israel, Issar Unterman. \n \n \n \n While many liberal authorities do permit abortion even for unwanted pregnancies when there is the potential of psychological damage to the mother, it should be noted that Judaism's qualified support for abortion is not rooted in the language of \"a woman's right to choose.\" A fetus is considered equivalent to a limb; just as Jewish law would prohibit someone from choosing to cut off their own limb, it would prohibit abortion without good reason. Conversely, most authorities would agree that a woman may not choose not to have an abortion if pregnancy or childbirth puts her life in danger\n \n This is article shows that the ancient hebrew interpretation of that passage is far from the newer pro-life interpretation.I am more inclined to Go with the hebrew non-biased source emoticon_xgood The hebrew interpretation makes more sense in the context of when a hebrew believed a human became a complete (nephesh) living soul (not until birth).

Many of the points you try to bring up have been ripped up (so have some of mine) such as this Exodus one and Bible supporting abortion one. You are just grabbing for straws.\n\n \nOthers have looked to the actual Hebrew words, themselves, to try and refute these verses. They note that the word \"yalad\" is used in verse 22 to describe the untimely birth, and that yalad is also used in other places to describe a live birth. They then go on to say other places in the Bible use the words \"nefel\" and \"shakol\" to describe a miscarriage. Therefore, the argument goes, the baby in Exodus 21:22 must have been born alive. It's easy to see how a novice might make this mistake, but a closer look at the words in question reveal the flaw in this argument.\n \n The word yalad is a verb that describes the process of something coming out - the departing of the fetus. Since it is describing the process, and not the result, it could be used to describe either a live birth or a miscarriage. Shakol which shows up in Hosea 9:14, is also a verb, but its meaning is to make a woman barren. Now a barren woman certainly might miscarry, but with this understanding of the word, it's clear why the writer of Exodus would not have used it since this miscarriage was caused by an accident, not by barrenness. And the word nefel is not even a verb. It's a noun. True, as a noun it is the term for a miscarried fetus, but the writer wasn't using a noun. He was using a verb to describe the coming out of the fetus. Thus, if I were describing a man falling to his death, I would use the verb \"to fall\" which can be used for both those who die and those who survive a fall, but to describe the man himself I would use the word the \"fatality.\" So we can see that while a novice might mistake a verb for a noun and come to the wrong conclusions about the original Hebrew words used in the Exodus passage, a more careful look proves that the words only describe the action of losing the fetus, not the fetus itself. And that being the case, we can't use the Hebrew translations to determine if the fetus was alive or not when it came out - so we are forced to accept that in all certainly, considering the medical knowledge at the time, the preemie died. This makes it even more clear that the \"tooth for a tooth\" passage refers only to the mother, not to the miscarried fetus. \nThis is why ancient Jewish law has always interpretated the verse to mean *premature birth* which was certian death for the fetus.Ancient hebrew interpreters KNEW their hebrew and their hebrew scripture better then the back of their own hands, much more so than a modern christian amature interpreter.",

The person that wrote Exodus later used the word shakol in its actual meaning. Yatsa was used numerous times in Exodus and never was used for miscarriage (as it is just not the word for it). This is very obvious from the links I presented. You just seem to provide quotes from something you read (not providing a source obviously). \n \n I suggest you try doing your own research instead of using someone elses written words to try and prove a point :) Shakel is used in Exodus which is the common word for miscarry..if you are so sure the writter was talking about miscarriage when using Yatsa (which is never used in the Bible to mean miscarriage I might add) then why do you provide no evidence other than what someone else falsly said?\n \n See my previous link for supporting documents.",
