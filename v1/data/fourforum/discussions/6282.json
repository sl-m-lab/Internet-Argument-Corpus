   "This explains a lot about the current administration:\n \n \nBen Bernanke, who recently left the Federal Reserve Board to serve as President Bush's top economic adviser, has argued that the problem is not with the United States. The trouble lies overseas, where people want to save rather than spend their money. The key is to encourage other countries to spend and invest more, he says, though he also believes that the federal budget needs to be balanced.\n\n \n So, Bushs top economic advisor is saying the problem is NOT the the US is being too fiscally irresponsible, but that people overseas are being just too damn responsible with their money. Does this joker really think that if people overseas were spending the way folks in the US are, they would be buying low quality, overpriced US goods? This guy must be living in some kind of time warp. Americans are not even willing to buy Americn junk.\n \n Contrast this with Volker on trade imbalance:\n \n \nHere's how economists, from former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker to former Clinton Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin to analysts at the\n International Monetary Fund, explain the danger: Americans, who go into debt to keep living a life beyond their means, are spending more and more of that borrowed money to buy goods from overseas.\n\n \n While I realize that it is unfashionable in political circles to take any kind of responsibiluty for anything ever, either at the personal level, or the national level, trying to externalize blame for out of control domestic spending is rediculous.",

   "The primary reason Asia supports our (US) debt is to maintain and advance their industrial technology and production capability. EU, to a much lesser extent, also has the same dependency. That's a major reason that while we looked stupid for invading Iraq, little was said or done by our trading partners. All trading countries want the US to economically keep our heads above water, even if it takes additional, unreasonable debt and limited war to drive our GDP and retain consumer confidence. The goal is expanded Asian markets, China in particular, to replace US volume. \n \n In 2004 the US CIA estimated China's GDP at $7.2trillion USD, based on exchange rates with the supposedly undervalued Yuan (RMB). The US, at $11.7trillion GDP, is currently at around a 3% annual GDP growth rate. China's annual growth rate is 10% (supposedly reduced to 9%). With continued growth, China will be where we are now in five years, probably less. And that's with a positive payment balance, industrial economy. \n \n No one wants the US to fail, at least not right now. Our GDP is full of holes from debt not calculated into GDP numbers and the fact we're now primarily a internal transaction economy, feeding on ourselves. Ideally we can keep all the balls in the air for another ten-years, when China would numerically surpass our GDP, but that'll be quite a feat on our present course. If we can keep going at our present rate for another five years, Asia and the EU would not founder with us as even if we lost 20% of our GDP due to economic circumstances as expanded internal Asian markets would take up most of the slack. Simplified, but the basics are all that's required.\n \n There are some interesting scenarios regarding decrease of resource demands by an appropriately timed major US economic slowdown (less expensive oil, gas, steel, wood, etc.) and how those lower cost resources would actually accelerate Asian and EU growth. Progressive, efficient Japanese vehicles would sound the death bell for Ford/GM while Daimler, BMW and others would capture the high-end markets. And on and on and on. As daewoo pointed out, resource rich Canada would fare well as would the EU and ME as they're drifting away from USD standard and Asia would pay in trade, not total debt. The question, as usual, is timing.",

Ability to service debt is still the only major issue, maintenance of which in a time of declining federal tax base and diminishing industrial capacity creating expanding payment imbalance will eventually require increased taxation. That'll be the moment of truth. \n \n The average American is unaware of any impact US debt has on USD value and subsequently his/her future standard of living. US politicians will continue to blame outside factors, be it Iran as a 'evil nation' or 'child labor' in China, India or at the North Pole, etc. Oil and other finite natural resources will eventually migrate from being USD dominated commodities, that's already began. The only question there is if the Euro, Yuan or a basket will dominate and when. \n \n Incidentally, cutting US government spending to normal levels would put US GDP into a negative position and shatter consumer confidence. We've painted ourselves into a corner. A annual deficit of $500billion is 4% of our GDP before flow-through transactions. We're projected for a 3.4% GDP increase in 2005.",

The hole we have dug is simply too deep for any kind fo non painful fix. We are falling off a cliff ontot the jagged rocks at the bottom, and there is simply nothing that can be done tio fix it at this point.\n \n We are an unproductive, service based, consumer nation. There is not enough money left in the entire country to rebuild our inductrial infrastructure to the point it should be, and even if we did, our standard of living has grown so high on the fat of our predecessors that even if we could wave a magic wand and repair that crumbling infrastructure, our goods are still not competitive because of the wages demanded by our labor pool.\n \n As far as I can ascertain, no matter how you run the numbers, there is no way out of this hole that does not involve a MASSIVE change to the standard of living for most Americans. Other nations will only finance our debt as long as it is profitable to do so, and that critical juncture is coming up faster than anybody really wants to admit.\n \n Add in the high probability that we will see a switch from a petro dollar to another currency (most likely euro IMO since the diversified nature carries a lot of appeal) and things could get nasty rather quickly. By operating on a petro dollar base, demand for USD has been created since people had to have them to buy oil. This essentially allowed the US for years to print and issue currency as a manufactured good. Saddam was accepting Euros for payment, and it was more than a little popular. A major market like Iran opening a Euro based oil market is a disaster for the US (I am sure we will be seeing an invasion soon). It seems likely that this has been inm the works for a while, and that the UE was at least somwhat aware of it. It certainly explains the way they have been playing patty cake with Iran lately.

There are huge tracts of land being used primarily to catch fire every few years when dry wood builds up, various utilities, highways, railroads, military bases that would be abandoned, that serve absolutely no useful purpose being owned by the US government.\n \n 3. Reduce as much as possible minimum wage standards with particular reference to legal standards which impose costs on employers but do not actually end up directly in the employees' payroll (ie guarantees of dental care, back massages, water coolers), to avoid the unemployment point 1. will generate, at the same time reducing unemployment benefits to levels of bare subsistence .\n \n 4. Eliminate taxes, both direct and indirect, on low income earners as much as possible, with special regard to taxes on cheap imported clothing and food.\n \n 1. and 2. are really the important ones for getting out of the hole the US has dug itself, IMO, but 3. and 4. would ease the pain on the working class without creating unrealistic welfare obligations.\n \n A more radical program would pare back the US government to its constitutional limits.",

   "Government spending, primarily military, is the most important issue. Due to nuclear weapons, the defense capibilty would be maintained as specified in our constitution. \n \n As posted, any substantial reduction in government spending will create negative GDP, crashing consumer confidence. Remaining requirements for adjusted US economics would then fall into line regardless of social issues. Our cities, with their large concentrations of poor, working poor and debt-maxed middle class will be the volatile situation. Dissatisfied voters are a politicians only known enemy. Cold, hungry ones with nothing or little to lose are a truly dangerous enemy. \n \n I think the social unrest in New Orleans following Katrina best describes what an uncontrolled citizenry without the basics are capable of in times of emergency. Police initially turned their heads from looting, car-jacking and most other crime, honestly stating any attempts at control would have prompted a full-scale riot. Those who could afford leaving New Orleans had left. \n \n My intent is not a doomsday scenario, just an attempt to illustrate the possibilities we face if we continue to refuse acknowledgment of our current, irresponsible direction.",

So while people willl not notice signs of inflation, the price of gas will be noticed and unless GWB decides to enact price controls, his public opinion ratings will drop.\n\n \n Ah, price controls on imported commodities. I didn't consider that one. What better use could be made of the world's most powerful (and very, very expensive) military? Sauds would go for it, probably Canada, but that still leaves Venezuela and 11% of our imported oil. I guess the only chore there is bringing hatred of agnostic communism out of the closet, dusting it off for a public refocus and every fundamentalist, racist and many true Christians in America will get closer to their mythical Mecca, sorry, Heaven. \n \n I still think the public will accept a good-sized fuel cost spike using the patriotic buzz word combined with natural disaster. They always think gas will 'go back down' when, as promised, the US becomes more energy independent by fighting terrorism and spreading democracy. Administration approval ratings, especially congress, are already in the worry area. I think administration will use the patriotic/national disaster angle by releasing some now full strategic reserves (be great if at purchase prices), get some political mileage from that and business as usual. They have a lot of lopsided balls in the air, but who knows what this crowd is capable of?",

Once a psychological level is breached, it tend to become the new base. \n \n Second, even if $3 is as high as it currently gets, that will put this years food prices through the roof, and everybody feels that.
