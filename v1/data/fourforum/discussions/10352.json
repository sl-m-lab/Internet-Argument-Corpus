   "**\n \n Metaphysics strangled by science---\n \n \"Mountains of new data are challenging old views\n Patrick Barry\n \n When scientists unveiled a draft of the human genome in early 2001, many cautioned that sequencing the genome was only the beginning. The long list of the four chemical components that make up all the strands of human DNA would not be a finished book of life, but a road map of an undiscovered country that would take decades to explore. \n \n \n \n JUNK BOOM. Simpler organisms such as bacteria (blue) have a smaller percentage of DNA that doesn't code for proteins than more-complex organisms such as fungi (grey), plants (green), animals (purple), and people (orange).\n S. Norcross\n \n \n \n Only 6 years later, the landscape of the genome is already proving to be dramatically different than most scientists had expected. \n \n The established view of the genome began to take shape in 1958, just 5 years after Francis Crick and James D. Watson worked out the structure of DNA. In that year, Crick expounded what he called the \"central dogma\" of molecular biology: DNA's genetic information flows strictly one way, from a gene through a series of steps that ends in the creation of a protein. That principle developed into a modern orthodoxy, according to which a genome is a collection of discrete genes located at specific spots along a strand of DNA. This old view got the basics right: that genes encode proteins and that proteins do the myriad work necessary to keep an organism alive. \n \n Researchers slowly realized, however, that genes occupy only about 1.5 percent of the genome. The other 98.5 percent, dubbed \"junk DNA,\" was regarded as useless scraps left over from billions of years of random genetic mutations. As geneticists' knowledge progressed, this basic picture remained largely unquestioned. \"At one time, people said, 'Why even bother to sequence the whole genome? Why not just sequence the [protein-coding part]?'\" says Anindya Dutta, a geneticist at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. \n \n Closer examination of the full human genome is now causing scientists to return to some questions they thought they had settled. For one, they're revisiting the very notion of what a gene is. Rather than being distinct segments of code amid otherwise empty stretches of DNA-like houses along a barren country road-single genes are proving to be fragmented, intertwined with other genes, and scattered across the whole genome. \n \n Even more surprisingly, the junk DNA may not be junk after all. Most of this supposedly useless DNA now appears to produce transcriptions of its genetic code, boosting the raw information output of the genome to about 62 times what genes alone would produce. If these active nongene regions don't carry code for making proteins, just what does their activity accomplish? \n \n \"What we thought was important before was really just the tip of the iceberg,\" says Hui Ge of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge, Mass. \n \n With the genome sequence in hand, exploration has moved at a brisk pace during the past 6 years. A milestone was reached in June, when a project called the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) thoroughly mapped the functional regions in 1 percent of the human genome. The effort involved was staggering: Thirty-five teams of scientists from around the world worked for 4 years and compiled more than 600 million data points, the consortium reported in the June 14 Nature. \n \n From the accumulating mountains of data, scientists are building a new picture of how the genome works as a whole. They have found mutations in nongene regions of DNA that are linked to common diseases such as diabetes and forms of cancer. And some researchers propose that DNA once labeled junk could have spawned the complex bodies of higher organisms-even the complexities of the human brain. \n \n \n Second fiddle to a superstar\n In the emerging picture of the genome's functioning, many of the key elements identified so far are molecules of RNA, a chemical cousin of DNA. \n \n In the old central dogma, RNA had a strictly subservient role in the all-important task of making proteins. An RNA molecule is made from units of genetic code strung together, much like DNA. But while DNA has two strands twisted together into a double helix, RNA usually has only a single strand. \n \n Protein synthesis begins when the two strands of a section of DNA unzip. Units of RNA then pair up with their counterparts on one of the DNA strands, forming a complementary messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule. The mRNA detaches and floats off to other parts of the cell, where it hooks up with machinery that transcribes its coded message into a protein. \n \n If RNA's only job were making proteins, then nearly all the RNAs produced in cells should be transcripts of protein-coding genes. (A small fraction of RNAs serve in the protein-transcription machinery.) But in 2005, Jill Cheng and her colleagues at Affymetrix, a genomics company in Santa Clara, Calif., showed that less than half of the RNA produced by 10 of the chromosomes in human cells represented transcripts of traditional genes. In the team's experiments, 57 percent of the RNA was transcribed from noncoding, \"junk\" regions. \n \n The results from ENCODE were even more striking. In the slice of DNA studied in that project, between 74 percent and 93 percent of the genome produced RNA transcripts. What becomes of this tremendous output is uncertain. John M. Greally of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York says it's likely that some portion of it is made accidentally and simply discarded. But the discovery that so much of the genome is being transcribed into RNA underscores how out-of-date the central dogma has become. \n \n Indeed, the closer researchers look, the more functions they find that RNA transcripts perform. An alphabet soup of new acronyms describes the newfound roles of RNAs. First there were short nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and short nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), both of which reside inside the nucleus and help control production of other RNAs. These were joined by microRNAs (miRNAs) and short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which can modulate the activity of protein-coding genes. In mice, about 34,000 of the RNA transcripts produced by the genome are nonprotein-coding, outnumbering the roughly 32,000 transcripts that code for proteins, according to a 2005 study by an international group of scientists called the Functional Annotation of Mouse Consortium. \n \n These new families of RNAs add a layer of regulation that fine-tunes the production of proteins. While scientists already knew that some proteins influence the activity of other genes, \"there are many more RNAs than proteins that play a regulatory role,\" Ge says. \n \n Gene regulation may not sound sexy, but it's a powerful way for a cell to evolve complex behaviors using the tools-proteins-that it already has. Consider the difference between a one-bedroom bungalow and an ornate, three-story McMansion. Both are made from roughly the same materials-lumber, drywall, wiring, plumbing-and are put together with the same tools-hammers, saws, nails, and screws. What makes the mansion more complex is the way that its construction is orchestrated by rules that specify when and where each tool and material must be used. \n \n In cells, regulation controls when and where proteins spring into action. If the traditional genome is a set of blueprints for an organism, RNA regulatory networks are the assembly instructions. In fact, some scientists think that these additional layers of complexity in genome regulation could be the answer to a long-standing puzzle. \n \n \n Genome as network\n The biggest surprise in the first sequence of the human genome was how few protein-coding genes it contained. \n \n \n \n TANGLED GENES. In the classic view of the genome (top), individual genes were distinct segments of DNA that a cell transcribed into RNA whole and in one direction. New data show that multiple and overlapping genes can occupy a single strip of DNA that also produces several functional RNAs that don't encode proteins (bottom, not to scale).\n S. Norcross\n \n \n \n \"We humans do not have that many more genes than simpler organisms like flies or mice,\" Ge says. Earlier guesses of the number of genes in humans ran as high as 100,000, but the published sequence in fact contained only about 23,000. That's not much more than the roughly 21,000 genes possessed by the roundworm, a microscopic creature without a brain. If protein-coding genes are the only functional elements in an organism's DNA, where does the extra information come from that's needed to assemble and operate the complex bodies and brains of people, as compared with the simplicity of roundworms? \"If we just look at the number of genes, it doesn't make sense,\" Ge says. \n \n While the number of genes isn't much different in roundworms and people, the human genome is 30 times the size of the roundworms'. People have a much larger quantity of DNA beyond what codes for proteins. Since much of this \"junk\" DNA is being transcribed into RNA, perhaps it's responsible for much of the complexity of human bodies and brains. In fact, organisms simpler than roundworms, such as single-celled bacteria, carry little noncoding DNA and may have no regulatory RNA at all. \n \n \"Scientists have been suspecting that it is the regulatory networks that lead to this amazing complexity\" in higher organisms, Ge says. \n \n John S. Mattick of the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia, points to a known example of the importance of regulatory RNAs: their crucial role in fetal development. For example, most multicellular animals possess a gene called Notch that helps guide neural development. While the gene itself has much the same form in both simple and complex animals, its activity is regulated by miRNAs that are highly variable from one animal to another. Such miRNAs also influence a gene called Hox, which acts in many animals to define a fetus' body axis and the placement of its limbs. \n \n What's more, the changes that distinguish human brains from those of chimpanzees and other apes could be due in part to evolutionary changes in RNAs that don't encode proteins. A group led by Katherine S. Pollard of the University of California, Davis identified DNA sequences shared by people and chimpanzees, but with large differences, meaning that they have evolved rapidly since the two species shared a common ancestor. \n \n The researchers found that one of these sequences is a noncoding region of DNA that's related to brain function, they reported in the Sept. 14, 2006 Nature. Pollard and her colleagues speculate that this region produces a regulatory RNA and that changes in this RNA contributed to the evolution of the human brain. \n \n With regulatory RNAs appearing to play such an instrumental role in animal development, it's no surprise that scientists are finding disease-associated mutations in regions of the genome formerly regarded as junk. \n \n David Altshuler of the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Mass., and his colleagues looked for DNA mutations in 1,464 patients with type 2 diabetes. Three of the mutations that correlated with the disease were in DNA segments that don't code for proteins, the team reported in the June 1 Science. Other scientists have found mutations in noncoding DNA that link to diseases such as autism, breast cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, and schizophrenia. \n \n To be sure, the specific functions of most of the noncoding DNA remain unknown. Projects such as ENCODE have focused on identifying the broad functional categories for active regions of the genome without working out the specific cellular function of each transcript, a task that will take biologists years, if not decades. \n \n In fact, scientists debate whether some fraction of the genome's copious RNA output might do nothing at all. It may simply be that once the cellular machinery that transcribes DNA into RNA gets started, it sometimes doesn't know when to stop. On the other hand, making lots of RNA that does nothing would be a waste of a cell's energy. That's something that natural systems tend to avoid, so the fact of its production argues for at least some of this RNA being biologically active. \n \n \n The gene is dead\n In the old view, each gene sat in splendid isolation on its segment of the genome. Other genes might be nearby, but scientists assumed that they didn't overlap each other. \n \n Now it's clear that a single length of DNA can be transcribed in multiple ways to produce many different RNAs, some coding for proteins and others constituting regulatory RNAs. By starting and stopping in different places, the transcription machinery can generate a regulatory RNA from a length of DNA that overlaps a protein-coding gene. Moreover, the code for another regulatory RNA might run in the opposite direction on the facing strand of DNA. According to the ENCODE project results, up to 72 percent of known genes have transcripts on the facing DNA strand as well as the main strand. \n \n \"The same sequences are being used for multiple functions,\" says Thomas R. Gingeras of Affymetrix. That introduces complications into the evolution of the genome, which had until recently been assumed to act through single DNA mutations affecting single genes. Now, \"a mutation in one of those sequences has to be interpreted not only in terms of [one gene], but [of] all the other transcripts going through the region,\" Gingeras explains. \n \n The implications of this single mutation-multiple consequence model are still a matter of debate. In some cases, the RNA transcripts from DNA that overlaps a protein-coding gene regulate that same gene, so a mutation could affect both the structure and the regulation of a protein. But often, those transcripts regulate genes that are far away, or even on different chromosomes. This complex interweaving of genes, transcripts, and regulation makes the net effect of a single mutation on an organism much more difficult to predict, Gingeras says. \n \n More fundamentally, it muddies scientists' conception of just what constitutes a gene. In the established definition, a gene is a discrete region of DNA that produces a single, identifiable protein in a cell. But the functioning of a protein often depends on a host of RNAs that control its activity. If a stretch of DNA known to be a protein-coding gene also produces regulatory RNAs essential for several other genes, is it somehow a part of all those other genes as well? \n \n To make things even messier, the genetic code for a protein can be scattered far and wide around the genome. The ENCODE project revealed that about 90 percent of protein-coding genes possessed previously unknown coding fragments that were located far from the main gene, sometimes on other chromosomes. Many scientists now argue that this overlapping and dispersal of genes, along with the swelling ranks of functional RNAs, renders the standard gene concept of the central dogma obsolete. \n \n \n Long live the gene\n Offering a radical new conception of the genome, Gingeras proposes shifting the focus away from protein-coding genes. Instead, he suggests that the fundamental units of the genome could be defined as functional RNA transcripts. \n \n Since some of these transcripts ferry code for proteins as dutiful mRNAs, this new perspective would encompass traditional genes. But it would also accommodate new classes of functional RNAs as they're discovered, while avoiding the confusion caused by several overlapping genes laying claim to a single stretch of DNA. The emerging picture of the genome \"definitely shifts the emphasis from genes to transcripts,\" agrees Mark B. Gerstein, a bioinformaticist at Yale University. \n \n Scientists' definition of a gene has evolved several times since Gregor Mendel first deduced the idea in the 1860s from his work with pea plants. Now, about 50 years after its last major revision, the gene concept is once again being called into question.\" \n \n \n http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20070908/bob9.asp",

Darwinist ditto-heads like Kronus, chemist, et al?\n \n I'll thank you to read what I post, if you please, and to refrain from doing what all the darwinist ditto-heads do as a matter of course--i.e., attempt to dismiss my opinions by a forced and false association with notions that have no connection whatsoever to my own ideas.\n \n As for the posted article, the obvious is obvious to any but an ideoluge blinded by commitment to a dogmatic creed. Pointing out the obvious hardly ever has the least positive effect on ideolgues, 'true-believers', be they 'creationists', 'darwinists', or rabid right-wing regressive politicoes like Ann Coulter, Rush Limbaugh, jim's trucking, and a few million zionist neo-cons.\n \n That is why I always hesitate to belabour the obvious. But since you are new here, and apparently prone to leap to unwarranted opinions about posters whose material you cannot possibly have read, I will make a slight effort, knowing in advance that it will be a waste of my time and energy.\n \n The article states that the \"modern orthodoxy, according to which a genome is a collection of discrete genes located at specific spots along a strand of DNA\", is false. \n But that is the very assumption upon which Fisher, Haldane, and Wright based \"the modern synthesis\", sometimes called NDT, sometimes simply, 'darwinism', etc.. Without that simplistic assumption the entire edifice of 'random/stochastic accidental/entropic genetic mutation determining positively productive, (albeit purely coincidental to environmental impact), organismic adaptation/evolution', quite simply fails.\n The article goes on to point out how and why that 'pre-1950' assumption, [which should have been dismissed even before 'the double helix'], was protracted into the present orthodoxy by Crick's Weismannian, anti-lamarckian diktat, \"The Central Dogma\". -- \n \"For one, they're revisiting the very notion of what a gene is. Rather than being distinct segments of code amid otherwise empty stretches of DNA-like houses along a barren country road-single genes are proving to be fragmented, intertwined with other genes, and scattered across the whole genome. \"\n \n So what are the odds of a gang of passing mutagens co-ordinating their attack so as to strike widely dispersed 'genes' simultaneously, so as to generate a definite/robust alteration in a 'gene-complex' that will coincidentally and deterministically confer a perceptible 'adaptive adavantage' to the organism at some local and particular time and place? What are the odds that an accidental/entropic system failure in the chemistry of the genomic code, as a replication/inheritance system, will do it? How naive, gullible, and ingenuously simple-minded does one have to be in order to believe that such presumption is scientifically acceptable?\n \n The article delivers another body-blow to the fisherian/darwinian assumption of 'chance', or 'spontaneous' generation of novel, original, adaptive organismic traits by genetic determinism working from accidental gene mutation and 'positive' chance coincidence with local environments, when it says--\n \"Most of this supposedly useless DNA now appears to produce transcriptions of its genetic code, boosting the raw information output of the genome to about 62 times what genes alone would produce.\"--\n \n Suddenly we are talking of 'genes', 'DNA', in terms of meaningful information, not as physical, 'bits of stuff', or even strings of 'data' that can be mechanically deterministic in physico-chemical, linear process from 'gene' to 'organism'. Now the 'genome' is a mechanical 'data processor', a machine under the control of a processor, and not 'chance', or its own corporeal self.\n \n Getting back to Crick, Weismannism, anti-lamarckism, and a foundational tenet of NDT, the article states--\n \n \"In the old central dogma, RNA had a strictly subservient role in the all-important task of making proteins. \"\n \n and--\n \n \"If RNA's only job were making proteins, then nearly all the RNAs produced in cells should be transcripts of protein-coding genes.

Evolution as a dynamic, systemic, teleological process, rather than a passive, particulate, directionless string of anomalous chemical events, as per darwinism.\n \n Every orchestra needs a conductor, and that role can't be played the string section, the horns, the percussion, or any combination of the tools, the instruments, themselves. Same for genes in a genome, etc. Claiming that 'some genes' do the job of 'conducting' the other genes is irrational, illogical, 'begging the question'.\n \n Further to the point--\n \n \"TANGLED GENES.

This synthesis was produced over a period of about a decade (1936-1947) and was closely connected with the development from 1918 to 1932 of the discipline of population genetics, which integrated the theory of natural selection with Mendelian genetics.\n \n Julian Huxley invented the term, when he summarised the ideas in his book, Evolution: The Modern Synthesis in 1942. Though the 'Modern Synthesis' is the basis of current evolutionary thinking, it refers to a historical event that took place in the 1930s and 1940s. Major figures in the development of the modern synthesis include R. A. Fisher, Theodosius Dobzhansky, J.B.S. Haldane, Sewall Wright, Julian Huxley, Ernst Mayr, Bernhard Rensch, George Gaylord Simpson, and G. Ledyard Stebbins.\n \n The modern synthesis solved difficulties and confusions caused by the specialisation and poor communication between biologists in the early years of the twentieth century. Discoveries of early geneticists were difficult to reconcile with gradual evolution and the mechanism of natural selection. The synthesis reconciled the two schools of thought, while providing evidence that studies of populations in the field were crucial to evolutionary theory. It drew together ideas from several branches of biology that had become separated, particularly genetics, cytology, systematics, botany, morphology, ecology and paleontology.\n\n \n And \n \n \nCentral dogma of molecular biology\n From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \u0095 Find out more about navigating Wikipedia and finding information \u0095\n Jump to: navigation, search\n Information flow in biological systems\n Information flow in biological systems\n \n The central dogma of molecular biology was first enunciated by Francis Crick in 1958[1] and re-stated in a Nature paper published in 1970:[2]\n \n The central dogma of molecular biology deals with the detailed residue-by-residue transfer of sequential information. It states that such information cannot be transferred back from protein to either protein or nucleic acid.\n \n In other words, 'once information gets into protein, it can't flow back to nucleic acid.'\n \n\n \n Fisher et al 1940s, Central Dogma 1958\n \n That would require that Fisher et al would be able to see the future and while I have always admired Fisher and Haldane for their accomplishments I do not think that they were able to see nearly 20 years into the future with that kind of precision.

   "I don't see what the fuss is about. The so-called Central Dogma of molecular biology (DNA --< RNA --< protein) was discarded years ago. Darwinian theory didn't even shake. The notion of 1 gene --< 1 protein has similarly been long gone, and Darwinian theory has barely noticed. The notion of a \"genetic blueprint\" where genes map simply on to traits also evaporated a long while ago as the complexity of the interaction between genes, control regions and numerous kinds of epigenetic factors started to become clearer, yet Darwinian theory barely trembled.\n \n None of this elucidation of the mechanics of evo-devo has had a negative impact on Darwinian theory, because it has never been based on HOW hereditary information is translated into organisms, or HOW development works. It's been based on measuring how natural selection alters the ability of organisms to pass on hereditary information to the next generation. \n \n Genetics, and now epigenetics and evo-devo are auxiliary theories that provide mechanisms for the hereditary transfer of information and the developmental relationship between a genome and the final form of the organism. The don't disprove the importance of natural selection to adaptations. That's been well-established independently.\n \n All the critics of Darwinism who imagine that the latest discoveries somehow disprove evolutionary theory probably have simply never bothered themselves to learn much about it. They are in the same boat as folk who constantly pop up to explain to the rest of us dimwits why Einstein and Newton were wrong.",

And does the other side just complain? There you go. \n \n Evolution has a large body of undisputed facts, billions of them in molecular biology alone, to draw on for its account. This includes the geological evidence, archaeology, molecular biology, ecology, and a number of other lines of inquiry. \"Creation Science\" has nothing behind it but quibbles, and a few dozen purported facts like human footprints in a dinosaur track, every one of them hotly disputed. There is no coherent theory. Creationists do not agree among themselves what role God plays in the universe, and there is certainly no suggestion of a way to predict non-physical phenomena.\n \n The problem of Intelligent Design is that the Designer is irreducibly complex. We could imagine aliens designing life on a particular planet, but we can't imagine aliens who could fake our geology to match us. And that would still require a Designer for the aliens.

The inaccuracies in their theories don't mean that the Sun orbits the Earth. Einstein refined Newton's theory to give right answers under a wider range of conditions. We're still running tests on even more extreme possibilities, to see whether Einstein needs refinement. \n \n In this case, also, the CD of MB has been refined, not discarded. RNA has enzymatic activity, so the flow is not only from DNA to proteins. And we knew that proteins could bind to DNA as promoters and suppressors of genes, so that feedback path has been in the theory since right after the discovery of the double helix. Now we have added another feedback path. Genes still exist, they are just not contiguous segments of DNA. Bits of protein from different segments can be joined together. This gives us a new mechanism for a more efficient model of evolution, allowing working proteins to be built from functional parts of pre-existing proteins, rather than having to evolve whole and entire independent of all others. In other words, it strengthens the theory of molecular evolution, and thus the theory of Natural Selection.\n \n Anti-evolution theory also evolves. We have seen the main argument evolve from Creationism to Intelligent Design under the selection pressures of public opinion and the courts on one side and the fervor of believers on the other.

Now, that person may accept the opinion of darwinists and creationists that \"Intelligent Design\" is simply a synonym for \"Creationism\", and that nobody should believe it possible to have a secular, but non-atheist, non-darwinist, non-materialist approach to evolution. Darwinists and creationists have been pedaling that lie for so long that it has become impossible to use the designation, 'intelligent design', without everyone leaping to the conclusion that what is meant is biblical literalism and bible worship.\n \n But that is not what I still take intelligent design to mean, even though, for the reasons just given, I no longer call myself an IDist.\n \n IAC, there is no 'rule' here or in any other philosophy public debating forum that says that nobody may oppose darwinism unless he or she is a committed creationist. And my choice of the word darwinism is explicit. The debate does not have to be, as it is labelled, 'creation vs evolution'. In my own case evolution is an historical fact, not a theory. A done deal, not a dubious metaphysical proposition. There is simply too much solid empirical evidence in the fossil record, the DNA record, and observed instances of the development of biological novelty, for any rational person to deny the proposition that lifeforms, beginning with a few 'common ancestors', have continuously changed over time in many remarkable ways, and diversified in many different directions. And that is what I, and most of this earth's human population, mean when they use the word, 'evolution'.\n \n However, darwinists and creationists have corrupted that word as well, until many people, (including yourself, apparently), have come to believe that 'evolution' itself is synonymous with the darwinian notion of its own causal mechanism. That being understood to be, \"RM+NS\".\n \n As firmly as I blieve in the fact of evolution, I am equally firm in my opinion that the chance-based, 'spontaneous generation', directionless and passive darwinian causal explanation for the origins of life's complexity and variety, is nothing more than a metaphysical prop, a pseudo-scientific excuse for the advance of evangelical atheism--which they corrupt to mean, 'secularism', as if their religious ideology were any more 'secular' than that of the most fundamental xtianist, muslim, jew, hindu, or whatever.\n \n \n\n and you certainly aren't an Evo. Why don't you give us a clue in your sig?\n\n \n **\n Dead wrong again, and a mistake you wouldn't have made if you'd done your homework before pigeon-holing me.\n \n \n\n So what do you believe?\n\n \n **\n As above. In a nutshell, evolution is right and darwinism is wrong.\n \n \n\n Why don't you like evolution? \n\n \n **\n I neither \"like\" nor \"dislike\" evolution. It would be altogether irrational to have a personal animus or affection for a brute fact. I don't like darwinism because it is a tool used to promote materialism, and materialism, aside from being a discredited metaphysic, is, IMO, largely responsible for the ecological and social disaster the world is undergoing. Forcing the debate over 'reality' to be a false philosphical dichotomy, either creationism or materialism, one or the other, no other options to be entertained, has completely screwed up the politics and economics of this planet, enabling the totally destructive rise of of corporate fascism.\n \n \n\n Don't just tell me it's unscientific.\n\n \n **\n Speaking of darwinism, [NOT evolution], it is unscientific because, all protests to the contrary, it is fundamentally and absolutely founded upon pure chance as its causal mechanism, which is not science, and upon spontaneous generation as its final 'explanation' for everything. That is, all of it can be reduced to and summed up as, \"It [everything]just 'happens', that's all!\" Which is a childish absurdity.\n \n \n\n I know that you think that.\n\n \n **\n You seem not to have the remotest clue as to what I think and believe.\n \n \n\n Why is it worth your time to refute? \n\n \n **\n Darwinism as a concomitant of materialism as a concomitant of evangelical atheism?

   "**\n Excuse me? Who gave you the notion that I am a 'creationist', and that biblical literalism means more than diddley-squat to me and my opinions? Darwinist ditto-heads like Kronus, chemist, et al?\n\n \n No, I got that impression directly from you, since I was unaware that there were non-creationists who oppose \"Darwinism\" with the same shoddy thinking the Creos use. But I see that I was wrong, so I apologize. \n \n \nI'll thank you to read what I post, if you please...\n\n \n I will be delighted to do so. But you can assist me greatly if you are willing to answer a few questions. \n \n The problem is that I understand the ideology of creationism, and of ID, and the science of our current understanding of evolution. But I had no idea what you meant by \"Darwinism\" until this post, and I still don't understand your position.\n \n You blast anti-Lamarckian Darwinism. Are you then a Lamarckian? What does that mean to you? I'm assuming that yours is not the primitive version Lamarck published long ago. What are the mechanisms for acquiring new characteristics and inheriting them in your version?\n \n To summarize your previous post then, with your own words in italics, and my comments plain:\n  [*]the \"modern orthodoxy, according to which a genome is a collection of discrete genes located at specific spots along a strand of DNA\", is false. \n \n This is not the modern orthodoxy. (Actually, there isn't one. Scientists argue strenuously all the time.) It was a previous theory, long superseded by far more accurate models, all of which still support Darwin's fundamental notion of random changes in heritable characteristics together with natural selection.\n \n [*]But that is the very assumption upon which Fisher, Haldane, and Wright based \"the modern synthesis\", sometimes called NDT, sometimes simply, 'darwinism', etc.. Without that simplistic assumption the entire edifice of 'random/stochastic accidental/entropic genetic mutation determining positively productive, (albeit purely coincidental to environmental impact), organismic adaptation/evolution', quite simply fails.\n \n This turns out not to be the case. \n \n To begin with, the model of mutation has also changed. The old model of only point mutations has also been discredited. Just as simple protein-coding genes (which still exist, even though there are other kinds) may be divided among several locations, so mutations can recombine pieces of genes to create functionally new proteins. As there are regulatory genes that code for proteins that bind to DNA as suppressors or promoters, so mutations can affect the expression of existing genes.\n \n Secondly, adaptation in multi-cellular organisms does not come primarily from new mutations. It comes from sexual reproduction, in which almost every individual is a new mixture of pre-existing traits. (Apart from identical twins and the like.) Some single-celled organisms swap genes, and viruses that insert their genetic material into host cell DNA can accidentally pick up or leave off genes in the process, or even get stuck there permanently. One of the most important evolutionary events was when some free-living ancestor of our mitochondria took up symbiotic residence in another cell.\n \n You can see the existence of antique genes through artificial selection quite easily. Somebody has bred horses the size of a sheepdog, roughly the size of eohippus. So many of those old genes or other genetic components are still there. Why would natural selection have difficulty selecting for size?\n \n You may call NDT Darwinism, but Darwin wouldn't have. The Darwinian theory is random mutation by unknown mechanisms, coupled with sexual reproduction and the readily observable processes of natural selection. I'm reasonably certain that you believe in the existence of random mutations and sexual reproduction, although you are apparently ignorant of many of the mechanisms of mutation. (Correct me if this is an improper inference. But do it politely this time.)\n \n Now explain this bit to me: Without the CD, NDT fails? How? And not only that, so what? The CD is in fact wrong, and NDT has been superseded by a far more successful theory, which for the sake of argument we can still call Darwinism. Now you have to deal with the new theory, in which we still have mutation, reproduction, and selection.\n \n [*]But without the \"Central Dogma\", anti-lamarckian weismannism, aka, \"Neo-Darwinian Theory\", is as dead as the dodo.\n \n So you say, but who are you to say? None of the scientists involved have noticed this trivially obvious error in the foundations of their enterprise. They will tell you, in fact, that the paper you cite is a triumph in the progress of evolutionary theory.\n \n [*]The article delivers another body-blow to the fisherian/darwinian assumption of 'chance', or 'spontaneous' generation of novel, original, adaptive organismic traits by genetic determinism working from accidental gene mutation and 'positive' chance coincidence with local environments...\n \n Since that isn't what NDT or indeed any theory of evolution has ever said, this is simply a non sequitur. The theory says that most of a population will be reasonably adapted to any persistent environment, although each species in the environment may have adapted in different ways. Which is why you get plants, birds, insects, and mammals in the same forest. Then modest changes in the environment can select for modest changes in life forms, and severe changes for larger adaptations, and long sequences of changes in the environment can select for large numbers of successive adaptations. So the disappearance of the dinosaurs allowed selection pressures for larger mammals to function unopposed, eventually resulting in giant ground sloths (even bigger than mammoths) and, in a quite different environment, whales.\n \n You seem to think that \"Darwinism\" calls for instantaneous development of fully functional organs, such as an eye or a pancreas. It says no such thing. Plenty of people have explained the evolution of eyes in multiple species, typically from quite primitive light-sensitive cells, which exist in many more species. Pit vipers, for example, where the pits are sensitive to infrared, and complement the function of the eyes, which are not. \n \n The evolution of the heart from a muscle around a blood vessel, to the two-chamber version, to three chambers in amphibians, to four chambers, is perhaps an example of what you are looking for. The mutations that went from two to three and from three to four are extremely unlikely. They apparently happened once each in a huge number of individuals over many millions of years. One in a billion individuals, once in a million years, is a one in a quadrillion chance. The law of large numbers basically says that one in a quadrillion chances are nearly certain to occur at least once in a quadrillion trials.\n \n Will you admit that some random organic chemicals are photo-sensitive, that random changes in organic chemicals occur, and that one such chemical appearing by chance in a nerve cell could make it light-sensitive at a very low level? If so, we can discuss what happens when selection kicks in. Or you can read Climbing Mount Improbable yourself. It brings all the research on this point together in an accessible form, and explains the sequence of events as it has been worked out for about 40 different vision systems, from planarian eye spots to squid, octopus, and mammals.\n \n [*]Every orchestra needs a conductor, and that role can't be played the string section, the horns, the percussion, or any combination of the tools, the instruments, themselves. Same for genes in a genome, etc. Claiming that 'some genes' do the job of 'conducting' the other genes is irrational, illogical, 'begging the question'.\n \n Begging the question yourself. You don't know how it could happen, therefore it can't. The argument from ignorance (argumentum ad ignorantiam) or lack of imagination is simply a fallacy.\n \n According to your theory, Mozart and Beethoven couldn't play a concerto while conducting from the piano. Actually, any decent orchestra can get through a piece without a conductor. It just won't sound quite as good if there is no single person who can hear everything and signal for adjustments.\n \n By your logic, the sun didn't start shining until the 1930s, when Hans Bethe and his colleagues worked out the sequence of nucleosynthesis in the proton-proton chain and the carbon cycle. And bumblebees couldn't fly until much later, when aerodynamics was able to incorporate dynamic vorticity.\n \n But do you actually deny the existence of promoter and suppressor genes?\n \n [*]...the published sequence in fact contained only about 23,000. That's not much more than the roughly 21,000 genes possessed by the roundworm, a microscopic creature without a brain. If protein-coding genes are the only functional elements in an organism's DNA, where does the extra information come from that's needed to assemble and operate the complex bodies and brains of people, as compared with the simplicity of roundworms?\n \n How about 2,000 genes? Your notion that roundworms are simple is biologically laughable. We are far closer to roundworms than roundworms are to bacteria, which themselves are hardly simple. (We don't know how to build one ourselves, you know.)\n \n Almost all of our genes are for components of mechanisms that operate inside the cell. There are only about 200 kinds of cell in the human body, most of which also occur in roundworms. We have many of the same structural genes, such as Hox, which controls body segmentation. Roundworms do have nervous systems, even if not brains, so we share a lot of genes for the proteins that construct the basic structures (sodium channels, axons, dendrites, synapses) and the neurotransmitters. \n \n [*]Many scientists now argue that this overlapping and dispersal of genes, along with the swelling ranks of functional RNAs, renders the standard gene concept of the central dogma obsolete. \"\n \n And with it the cornerstone of Weismannism, anti-lamarckism, and \"NDT\".\n \n CD dead, NDT superseded, evolution stronger than ever. Can you point to even one of those \"many scientists\" who say that replacing CD wipes out mutation, genetic scrambling, and natural selection? Or supports any kind of Lamarckism?\n \n So, to wrap up, I still don't understand what you mean by \"Darwinism\". If evolution is chugging happily along in the DNA/RNA/protein/etc. world and NDT is dead, where does your problem lie? Lamarckism? Please explain.\n \n Wikipedia says, \"Jean-Baptiste Pierre Antoine de Monet, Chevalier de Lamarck (August 1, 1744 - December 28, 1829) was a French soldier, naturalist, academic and an early proponent of the idea that evolution occurred and proceeded in accordance with natural laws...In the modern era, Lamarck is remembered primarily for a theory of \"inheritance of acquired characters\", called \"soft inheritance\" or Lamarckism. However, his descriptions of soft inheritance were, in fact, reflections of the folk wisdom of the time, accepted by most natural historians (including Charles Darwin in his Origin of Species). Lamarck's contribution to evolutionary theory consisted of the first truly cohesive theory of evolution, in which an alchemical complexifying force drove organisms up a ladder of complexity, and a second environmental force adapted them to local environments through \"use and disuse\" of characteristics, differentiating them from other organisms.\"\n \n Well, then, Darwinism is Lamarckism. What's the problem? emoticon_xgood \n \n Er, wait, alchemical complexifying force? Environmental force? Can you explain?",
