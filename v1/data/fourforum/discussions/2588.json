   "When I read about tariffs it always makes me suspect. What determines which industries the Federal government will step in to protect? I think it's great we suddenly want to make sure Americans buy American made furniture, but why didn't we step in to protect the rest of the domestic manufacturing over the last 25 years before all those jobs were lost? The government sat on its hands while heavy equipment, automobiles, textiles, electronics, tools, and other American made products went to Japan, Taiwan, Korea, and now China. Why do furniture makers suddenly deserve protection? Again, I'm suspect of the motives. We have an election coming up and I guess this administration wants to send us the message that they're looking out for us and getting tough on imports. Or, they've decided it's easier to save old jobs than create new ones; they seem to be falling short on that commitment.",

Congress denied federal unemployment benefit extensions, the last big wave of factory closings will exhaust their benefits from last March through September and seasonal jobs (fruit pickers, etc.) are beginning their traditional employment period. That was an easy facade for one of the government numbers the American Public bases its faith on. N. Carolina is a state Bush wants.",

Either way, I'd like to hear anyone's solutions.\n\n \n Playing field has absolutely nothing to do with trade. It follows the simple rule of supply and demand. The rest is tacked on by the respective traders. For a country to protect a valuable national asset that produces tax revenue and enriches that country's populace is smart politics. \n \n Using the US bedroom furniture industry as an example, all I see is overpriced, mass-produced furniture. Using import tariffs to make competitive products similarily priced will produce tax revenue, but the US consumer will pay the tariff price on a personal basis. The reward factor for that is the NC furniture industry will remain intact, I don't know what the number of jobs involved is but each counts in an election year, with me helping subsidise a company that didn't move their manufacturing offshore for whatever reason. That's bad economics for me or my government. Any freshman marketing student can tell you lower priced identical major purchase products (bedroom furniture) will cover a broader market and return greater tax revenue at local levels. \n \n I don't see issues of inefficiency, although that is becoming more pronounced as some US corporations are still attempting to meet import prices with decreasing quality control. Our standard of living simply increased to a point where we were no longer competitive in a world market. We were king of consumer goods and most industrial applications for a long time. Our economy exited WWII with an industrial infrastructure that easily converted to peacetime production and had the capacity to serve the entire world. \n \n In the '70s many countries devastated by WW11 began regaining their financial health. Imports into the US started and the rest is history. Our worker wages, benefits and government regulation had progressed far beyond the cheap labor countries. The Japanese and some European manufacturers who had healed early were standard of living advanced and successfully penetrated our markets with superior quality and continue to do so to this day. \n \n I believe world trade will, as always, identify the strengths and weaknesses of individual nations. Those who specialize in quality fill a niche and those who can produce acceptable products at the lowest price, China, will become very rich. \n \n I consider worker treatment a moral issue, not commerce, and the private business of any sovereign nation. I certainly don't want another folly like Iraq for moral and humanitarian reasons. Far too expensive in money, lives and goodwill. Our unskilled or semi-skilled manufacturing is history. There are however plenty of immigrants many people seem to despise doing honest labor that could be accomplished by residents displaced by our industrial decline. But it will take an inevitable major economic fall before those formerly cared for from cradle to grave people decide they're hungry for a little independence.",

You need to explore the factors that influence this phenomenon, which can include non renewable resources, labour, skills, transport, monopolies, culture or even prejudice and human nature etc. The list is endless.\n\n \n What I've studied about China's emergence from full totalitarian to a mix of values with Central control is almost textbook in commerce planning and execution. Let's not forget they've been sending their best minds to nothing but superior universities outside of China since Nixon opened the doors over 30 years ago. On an academic level, they stand with the best. Taiwan and Hong Kong were China's product distributors since the late '50s, growing in scale until China was able to modernize their port infrastructure in the early '90s. At that point, they had superior management talent with depth to carry the torch, manufacturing expertise, low labor costs, distribution capability and so much foreign investment capital was being thrown at them they were and are picking and choosing their partners. \n \n China's leaders manage their country on a never-ending series of ten year plans, of which only the primary goals are set in stone. With their capability, I can't think of a better method of securing control of world consumer markets to develop positive trade cash flow than going in at your best possible price, guaranteed to blow the competition out of the water with no hope of regrouping. \n \n With a goal of a $10k per capita income still years away, that strategy allows plenty of room for increasing cost of goods sold and operating costs to meet that goal, without affecting margins. And if you've taken the time to plan your program as China did, competitors will not be an issue. You merely put 5-10 years in the plan to dominate markets to a point where their industry and labor pool become so obsolete and they couldn't match your price with any effort. Early into that, you own the world of big investment capital, with no partner owning more than 50% of any venture. We weren't that smart on our best day. \n \n The non-renewable resources are in place, all through trade agreements without even a shot fired with countries who recognize China's potential and want to get on the bandwagon. An oil pipeline from and through countries China is culturally as far removed from as it gets? And we're invading countries like Iraq trying to force our system in decline on them? \n \n I've rambled on because IMO, non renewable resources, labor, skills, transport, monopolies, culture or even prejudice and human nature aren't current issues, and barring a nuclear world war, China is presently the 600 pound gorilla and will be for more than my remaining lifespan. I feel they're going to experience industrial dominance and accumulation of national wealth the US enjoyed not all that many years ago that put us where we were, and for every action there's a reaction; guess who gets displaced as king. \n \n I'll leave the 20 year out theories to those who get paid for it. That's a boring numbers game using models based on past trends and still theory in summary form. WWII facilitated our economic rise while China has done it from ground zero. Using models to predict China has, IMO, poor odds at success. Their ten year plan, beyond the one in use, ends in 2021, and still reserves their plans for alternative fuels to internal use, and that's where my interest lies. Does anyone know of a US government policy other than population expansion infrastructure and military planning that goes more than an administration term?",

That's one of the best ways to breed increased incompetancy and incurr retaliation. If a company has total dominance with an exclusive product and stockholders are content with margins, I see an export tariff on exclusive products as a more favorable method of taxation than increasing delivered product cost as increased executive performance compensation and pre-dividend taxes would dilute any gains to shareholders.

Since I'm not a citizen of the US, I, like many others, would probably not lend a sympathetic ear while witnessing the US displacement from the top of the food chain.\n \n If the US is on the course you are projecting, it is indeed poetic justice for many of the countries that have been victims of previous \"US enterprise\", especially those that have jumped on the asia pacific band wagon. So everyone... bow before your new god... China! emoticon_smile\n \n I find it amusing that we are spending so much time analysing economies when people can't even address simple issues like culture, or more specifically work ethics. The US doesn't even come close to matching our Asian counterparts on that one. Not that I'm implying it would ever want to.\n \n I thought for a moment that you were going to suggest that the US should be following China's economic model. But as you rightly point out, the US population is nowhere near ready to make that sacrifice. So at least the cradle to grave nurturing remains secure!",

With our massive trade imbalance, out-of-control deficit spending to support aggressive foreign policy and fading dollar, propping up failing US companies with import tariffs to keep jobs for election purposes will eventually become a thing of the past. Let's face facts; annual national losses approaching annual national budgets simply can't be maintained on a long-term basis. Once China's standard of living rises to a point where internal consumer demand can absorb enough production to produce acceptable margins, retaliation to tariffs will be swift and without mercy, much as the US punished former trading partners during our reign. \n \n We (the US) aren't exactly surrounding ourselves with favorable trading partners by being world bully or our mix of free trade and isolationism and slighted nations such as China have very, very long memories. Especially when they're a very important financing source for our national debt and trade imbalance because they currently need our markets.
