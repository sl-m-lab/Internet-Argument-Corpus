   "How fair is the U.S. if they inprison a man for at least a quarter of a century and continue to refuse parloe? And then they highlight the story to make it appear acceptable. The FBI went into Oglala June 26th many years ago to put down native american resisitance to lack of governement help that was promised and needed. Who wants to be taken form the land, life, people and everything they know into a situation where dreams die and future flys away to a more hopeful landing. IF you were to research FBI involvemnet in Oglala you would most likely see government pages talking pointlessly and supporting thier position while hey try to supress otehr ideas and the telling of the otehr side of the story. Can anyone expalin what is happening to the United States, or why the government is without morals or any sense of justice? I would sure like an explaination, along with many others. How about we let the FBI explain to the families they tore apart and those who saw the death they caused. How would any human be able to deal with that if they have a consience? Since the FBI maintains thier view that they alone are right, maybe they are withuot consicence.",
