   "Poor George W. Bush:\n \nPROTESTERS have demanded that US President George W Bush get out of Peru where he is attending an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, blaming him for the world economic crisis.\n\n The Raw Story | 'War criminal Bush' blamed for worldwide crises\n \n And, even in the good old U.S. of A.:\n \nNovember 22, 2008\n Op-Ed Columnist\n Time for Him to Go\n By GAIL COLLINS\n Thanksgiving is next week, and President Bush could make it a really special holiday by resigning.\n \n Seriously. We have an economy that's crashing and a vacuum at the top. Bush - who is currently on a trip to Peru to meet with Asian leaders who no longer care what he thinks - hasn't got the clout, or possibly even the energy, to do anything useful. His most recent contribution to resolving the fiscal crisis was lecturing representatives of the world's most important economies on the glories of free-market capitalism.\n \n Putting Barack Obama in charge immediately isn't impossible. Dick Cheney, obviously, would have to quit as well as Bush. In fact, just to be on the safe side, the vice president ought to turn in his resignation first. (We're desperate, but not crazy.) Then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi would become president until Jan. 20. Obviously, she'd defer to her party's incoming chief executive, and Barack Obama could begin governing.\n\n http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/22/opinion/22collins.html\n \n Yeppers! The chorus is getting louder and louder...\n \n Go! Bush! Go! Leave! Bush! Leave!\n \n And Cheney too!",
