   "It is true there is no doubting the evolution in all things. One need only look back billions of years to see the act of creation unfolding in the formation of Galixies and Systems.\n\n It is important to realize that the word evolution has a different meaning when applied to the universe and galaxies as opposed to biological organisms. In the broad sense, evolution means change sometimes with an implication of progress. That's what it meant in Victorian England when Darwin was published Origin. That is why Darwin objected to the application of the word to his theory. Darwin realized that his theory of common descent implied no sense of progress. But the use of the word evolution in reference to Darwin's theory became so common that by the 6th edition of Origin even Darwin used it.\n \n But it is important to realize that galactic evolution is not part of the theory of evolution and just because galaxies change implies nothing for biology. It confuses people to try to lump the use of the word in other sciences to mean change with the word as used in the biological sciences where it means a specific kind of change by specific mechanisms.\n \n Creationists, who are usually scientific illiterates, lump even the origin of the universe under their straw man version of evolution. The creationist version of evolution includes any bit of science that is in conflict with their mythology. That includes astrophysics, cosmology, astronomy, genetics, population genetics, paleontology, paleoanthropology and so on.\n \nThe problem is we as a spiecesis have not evoled very much at all in the last 180 000 years.\n\n Modern humans first appeared about 120,000 years ago. But it depends on what you mean by \"...not evoled [sic] very much at all...\" Generally, modern humans are less robust than in the past. For example, the trend toward processed food has resulted in smaller molars. Paleolithic humans (about 30,000 years ago) had facial features that were 20 to 30% more robust. Even Mesolithic humans has features that were about 10% more robust.\n \n But I fail to understand the problem is humans haven't evolved much. 180,000 years (actually closer to 120,000) isn't all that long in evolutionary terms. Our species and the chimpanzees separated some 5 to 7 million years ago.\n \nThier is also the bizare question of Neandertal man with his small cranium, lack of forehead, huge monkey jaw, thick set bones to carry a much larger musle density.\n\n Neandertals had a larger cranium than modern humans. They had an average cranial capacity that was about 100 cc larger. Where did you get this stuff? They had a forehead but is sloped somewhat more than in modern humans. They also had a large brow ridge. The Neandertal jaw did not resemble that of a monkey but the chin receded more than in modern humans.\n \nThese walking monkeys looked nothing like us and yet used oacer in berial serimonies.\n\n Well, Neandertals looked nothing like monkeys either. They were not monkeys, walking or otherwise, but members of our own genus. And I'm not sure of the significance of using \"oacer in berial serimonies.\"\n \nFlowers and other small gifts have been found in these monkey graves.\n\n You give the impression that burial of the dead was generally true of Neandertals. They were around for some 200,000 years, from 230,000 years ago to about 30,000 years ago. The oldest Neandertal burial site is about 100,000 years old. And again, Neanderthals were not monkeys. They didn't look like monkeys or act like monkeys, and they weren't even descended from monkeys. Neandertals were a species of human.\n \nThe interesting thing is we did not desend from these apes. The DNA proves a common heratige but no interbreeding. We did not desend from these monkeys.\n\n You don't seem to be able to make up your mind between monkey and ape. Neandertals weren't apes either, at least in the sense that you mean. DNA has been extracted from three specimens of Neandertal, widely separated in time and location. It seems to indicate that there was no interbreeding. However, there is other evidence that indicates otherwise. \n \nWe did have a common ansester. So what you may ask?\n\n Yes we most certainly did have a common ancestor. And no I don't ask, \"so what?\"\n \nWell we as a speicies lived along side these walking apes for 150 000 years.\n\n There's that ape bit again. If Neandertals were apes, then we also are apes. And, of course, we actually are. But you seem to get your years about double in every case. I think that modern humans first met the Neandertals about 70,000 years or so in the Levant. Modern humans didn't reach Europe until about 40,000 to 50,000 years ago. Maybe I'm wrong, but those are numbers I seem to remember. I can look it up if necessary.\n \nThe evidence also suggests we wiped them out compeating for teratory in there last srong hold western europe.\n\n That's speculation. It is possible but it could have also been the effects of a warming climate on a cold adapted species.\n \nThe last focils of this line can be found in cliffs overlooking the atlantic ociean in spain.\n\n I think they were found in Spain and it is among those fossils that one that appears to be a hybrid child has been found.\n \nThe thing is the last monkey man died out 30 000 years ago at this time the Aboriginal had been in Australia for already 30 000 years.\n\n One last time, not monkeys or resembling monkeys or descended from monkeys. If Neandertals were still alive today they would be our closest relatives. Instead our most closely related species are the chimpanzees.\n \nEastern logic suggests oppisits are extreams of the same condition. The logical conclusion to draw in this debate is that we were created and evolved. One does not rule out the other.\n\n Actually, that isn't logical at all. We can conclude that we have evolved, as we can conclude that all living organisms have evolved. We see a lot of evidence the this is true. However, there is no evidence to support the mythology of creation. One creation myth is as good as another. Even the Bible has two. How shall we decide without evidence?\n \nA gift of DNA would explain the missing link.\n\n I have no idea what that is supposed to mean. What missing link?\n \nIt would also tie in with the creation myths that can be found in almost every culture.\n\n It would?\n \nAll Mitocondreal DNA can be traced back to one African woman that lived aproxamitly 180 000 thousand years ago. A highly unlikely synaryo given our understanding of evolution.\n\n Well, given your apparent understanding of evolution, maybe. However, not only is the scenario likely, it is a given. The only thing in doubt is how long ago the most recent common female ancestor of all humans lived. Of course, that doesn't mean that she was not a member of a large population and that doesn't tell us how long ago the most recent common male ancestor of all humans lived. Usually the two calculations come out a few hundred thousand years apart.\n \nLet us create the Adam in our image. He may well have been the first test tube baby.\n\n No. There is no evidence of a miraculous process or of the special creation of mankind. We seem to have evolved by natural processes from earlier ancestors.\n \n Here's a site that will give you some information on all of the hominid species we've found. http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/species.html Hopefully you can begin to correct your misunderstandings of human evolution.",

   "My dear God in heaven, I do believe we are in regression....\n\n To put it mildly. My first thought was, \"how bizarre!\" At the risk of causing further mental trauma to the poor soul, I'm going to address some of that XXXX, even though it shows a depth of thought a bit below a chimpanzee.\n \nI am concerned with the thoughts of god everything else is just detail!\n\n Isn't that just peachy? I am glad that you are able to discern the thoughts of god. I thought you were talking about those details, and you were wrong.\n \nYou are quick to wave the flag of science my friend. I would not be so quick.\n\n It seemed to me that you were trying to discuss science, as little as you apparently understand it. I was trying to correct your misunderstandings.\n \nI ask you where are your universal laws? As a scientist it is your duty to inform me the high school drop out that you have so aptly disected that you have no laws. None. Not one! Every where such order and not one law aplies to everything. Hmmmmmmmmm.\n\n I actually have no idea what that is supposed to mean or why it should be relevant. What are universal laws? Are you talking about the Grand Unification Theory in physics? I was discussing evolutionary biology.\n \n You seem proud to be a high school drop out. How sad.\n \nYou are forced to ask yourself does reductionism work. Well mabe if your trying to expose unproven assertions in anothers work to make your self sound more intelligent it does.\n\n Do you know what reductionism is? I suspect not. But the assertions that you made that I discussed were not only unproven, they have been falsified. They are wrong. They have been proven wrong. I was merely addressing your mistakes. There was no effort to make myself \"sound more intelligent.\" I am what I am, intelligent or not, and you aren't don't matter enough that I should \"try\" to make myself appear more intelligent than I am. I was addressing your errors. If you feel that it makes you look stupid, then so be it.\n \nOh yes the glory of being a scientist let us all lay at your feet. High preast of the state sposered religion where are your universal laws?\n\n What is that supposed to mean? All of that because you demonstrated your dismal ignorance of science and evolutionary biology and I corrected you? Perhaps you should go and find a Disney board where your thoughts will be respected.\n \nI supose your going to tell me also that light is only the ability to do work. Reduce, Reduce,Reduce,Reduce.\n\n Again, I am baffled. Why would I ever tell you that light is only the ability to do work. I think that you must be quite confused.\n \nSo big bang doesnt aply to evolution ha. Well matey your wrong.\n\n Let me see. You, a high school drop out knows more about my field than I do. Right. The theory of evolution applies to living organisms and only living organisms. That is because biological evolution is a specific kind of change caused by specific mechanisms. Other change is not part of the theory of evolution. Stellar evolution is not part of the theory of evolution and biology, but part of a theory in astrophysics. In that context it means change according to certain known patterns that depend on the mass of the star.\n \nThoes atoms in your body heavyer than that of Iron can only be created in the supernova explosion of star. Hmmmm. Infact all elements heavyer than helium must be created in the fusion process of a star.\n\n That is correct. What does that have to do with the biological theory of evolution.\n \nHow did they get into your body? Did you rationalize them thier.\n\n The got there by natural processes from my environment. Did you have a meaningful point?\n \nI am sure you reducers could reduce your self out of exsistance if you tried hard enough.\n\n Again I have no idea what you are talking about. You seem to be undergoing some sort of cognitive dissonance.\n \nEvolution works on all levels. Systems are not self contained. There is a direct process and interaction.\n\n Evolution is the change in the heritable makeup of a population of living organisms over generations. How many levels are there to that and what does that babble about systems and interaction mean? The theory of evolution is a theory of biology that applies only to living organisms. In any other context, the word is descriptive only, possibly with another specific meaning in that context. You seem to be confused by the same word in different contexts with different meanings. It is a sign of ignorance.\n \nThere are universal laws I know them and you do not. Sound so smart now do you. You might have to reduce your self out of this one.\n\n Well I guess you got me there, since you actually seem to be talking gibberish to me. Do you actually have any basis in reality for anything that you say? Are we to believe that you are in possession of some mystical knowledge that is denied to the rest of mankind? Do they let you out of your padded room every day?\n \nThe truth is there is no truth. The Tao that is spoken is not the true Tao.\n\n Right! I quite understand. Which way is up?\n \nIf you can not see huge gaps in the transitional evolution of man why is it my resposibilty to show you. Lazyness, find them yourself.\n\n But we didn't discuss the evolution of man, transitional or otherwise. Exactly what does \"transitional evolution\" mean? I am perfectly aware of gaps and uncertainties in the evolution of mankind. You see, I have actually spent some time and money to investigate exactly that. In less than a minute, I could hand you at least three books from my bookshelf that deal exclusively with the evolution of mankind. My bet is that I have invested more time, effort and money into educating myself than you have.\n \n But claims of \"I know and I'm not going to tell you\" are just evidence that you are ignorant and that you know you are ignorant. There is no Tao involved. I suspect that you don't understand that either, much less the Tao of Physics.\n \nIt must hurt knowing ones religion is dieing.\n\n I wouldn't know. But since you have no idea of my religion I can only assume that your words are prompted by some realization about your own superstition based religion. I'm sorry for you.\n \nScience only exsists because it was created by the royal society(freemasons) to lock the human mind in its left side.\n\n You're pretty much of a superstitious, vast conspiracy theory sort, aren't you.\n \nTry using all of your brain for once. Prove prove prove reduce reduce reduce lazyness shame on you. Beaten by a highschool drop out that cant even spell. Oh dear.\n\n Let me see if I understand what you are saying. You dropped out of high school and I have graduate degrees and somehow it is I who is not using my brain, is that what you are saying? The \"Prove prove prove reduce reduce reduce lazyness shame on you\" bit is just meaningless babble. Again, I doubt that you actually know what reductionism is. Not once where I corrected your ignorance can it be interpreted as reductionism. I am not, in fact, a reductionist. I think maybe that you have learned some words that sound powerful to you and you use them, even though you don't actually know what they mean.\n \nMy advice to you is think twice before taking on someone who tags themself prometheus.\n\n I certainly will in the future. Only a fool would claim that an internet handle somehow invested them with power and knowledge. You are such a fool that it is actually difficult to compose a rational and coherent answer to your XXXX. Vomit is a mess and cleaning it up is messy.\n \nDo not argue with an idiot(scientist) they will only drag you down to your level and beat you with experiance.\n\n So, if I shouldn't argue with an idiot, are you saying that I should ignore you? How can arguing with you drag me down to my level? Aren't I already at my level?\n \n You are quite pathetic.",

   "[snip pseudo-philosophic poetry]\n \nHey Zombie is the opposite of DNA RNA I am not sure\n\n The question doesn't make sense. The concept of \"opposite\" doesn't make sense when applied to DNA and RNA. Up is the opposite of down, hot is the opposite of cold, automobile is the opposite of ???, and horse is the opposite of sheep. Sometimes the concept opposite just doesn't apply to something.\n \n But the short answer is no.\n \nfor us to look at biology with in the context master Lau Tzu layed out it needs to be the opposite of DNA.\n\n Then master Lau Tzu is wrong. Sorry.\n \nDo I realy mean Proteans. Are proteans RNA.\n\n Do you mean protein? No. Proteins are not RNA.\n \nSo tell me thier are four letters that make up DNA and is it true that molicules match up to these like a mirror. Is it chains of three. Is it about 23 diferent combinations for proteans. These proteans get together and make up an infanate combination of biological molicules we call ammino acids. These things are life. I now you know more stuff about this than me and I want you to clear this up for me.\n\n That was confused. DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid. It is a molecule made up of two polynucleotide chains that twist around each other in what is called a double helix. Each of these polynucleotide chains is made up of pentose sugars (deoxyribose) linked together by phosphate molecules. One of 4 nitrogenous bases (nucleotide) is linked to each sugar. They are adenine and guanine (purines), and thymine and cytosine (pyrimidines). Each nucleotide on one chain is linked by hydrogen bonds to a nucleotide on the other chain, but adinine links only with thymine (2 bonds) and cytosine links only with guanine (3 bonds). This double helix makes up the chromosomes and certain regions contain the genes that pass characteristics from one generation to the next. The genes encode a sequence of amino acids that constructs a protein. It works like this (simply). The hydrogen bonds between the bases are separated and the free bonds then link to free bases. These in turn are linked to a ribose/phosphate chain. In this chain, the base uracil replaces thymine. The ribose sugar makes this chain RNA (ribonucleic acid). It is single stranded. The RNA strand separates from the DNA that it has duplicated. It moves to the ribosomes in the cell. This RNA strand is called messenger RNA or mRNA. There, other three base sequences of RNA are attached to a single amino acid. These align themselves in the order specified in the mRNA, thus aligning the amino acids in the correct sequence to form the protein. This kind of RNA is called transfer RNA (tRNA). Of course, proteins make up the structure of an organism and the enzymes by which it operates.\n \nI think in terms of relationships. Infanite relationships that can not be disasociated.\n\n I don't. I don't even know what that means. I think more of processes of which relationships are a part.\n \nI never forget my matter is at least six billions years old. Infact it could be true to say that all sub atomic particles are as old as the universe itself. This is just the way I think.\n\n Probably true but I don't see the point in trying to apply that to processes.\n \nFor me reductionsm is the way you cut up my work. Very Rude.\n\n No it was neither rude nor reductionism. You information that was wrong. Not just a little off, but way wrong. I tried to correct you. If you are going to post information without knowing what you are talking about, then be prepared for someone to correct you.\n \n [snip of more pseudo-philosophic poetry]\n \nChili Pepers talk about Sex Magic. Man Love is not chemicals and biological functions. If you do not know what love is man put a chilli pepers album on and have a smoke. Dude you need to chill out I am a XXXX stirer. I am Australian, this is what we do we get on the XXXX and take the XXXX. I know your smarter than me I just wanted to see if you could handle what you so easily dish out. Chill Man. You are a scientist look for the pattern. Find it. See if it appliys to everything. I have. I have found nothing that these laws do not apply to. If they apply to everything then they must be universal.\n\n Nonsense. You were not taking the XXXX. You just didn't know what you were talking about. You got offended, not me. You should \"chill\". I know lots of people in OZ. An internet mate of mine is Paul Willis, a plaeontologist and science reporter for ABC. Maybe you've heard of him.\n \nAnd man if I am rite about the negative temporal universe a high school drop out that can't spell just solved Big Bang.\n\n I'll believe it when I see it. But generally the science done by high school drop outs is less than adequate.\n \nHey Zombie do you drink Green Label. I would enjoy having a drink with you, your mind is razor sharp you riped me to shreds.\n\n I drink Scotch, single malts.\n \nI had to lauph at how you got so upset.\n\n I corrected you. I wasn't upset. I just don't like to see pure XXXX posted as scientific opinion. It's bad enough when creationists post XXXX.\n \nIts not every day you get to talk to an Biologist. I am a drillers offsider and offcourse the discusions are not very engageing.\n\n I can well imagine.\n \nAlso carbon dateing is still new.\n\n No. It's not. It has been around for a while now and has been calibrated back to about 45,000 years. I hope by carbon dating you didn't actually mean radiometric dating which is the name for dating things by using various radioactive elements.\n \nYou now what I mean about monkey men they did look rather odd.\n\n But the don't look anything like a monkey. They don't even look like a chimp.\n \nThat kid they found in spain yes it looks as though it was a hybrid. Is it true hybrids are steryl.\n\n Some are some aren't. A mule, a hybrid between a jack (male donkey) and a mare is generally sterile. So is a hinny, a cross between a jenny and a stallion. But a hybrid between a Polar bear and a Brown bear is not.\n \nI am not going any where just yet I want to pick your mind if you don't mind.\n\n I guess. But you should know that I think your philosophy is pretty meaningless.",

   "Galactic evolution occurs through the ability of energy to obay universal law and transmit information in the form of vibration.\n \n Earth, Air, Water, and fire create biological molicules. These molicules are energy that obays universal law and is encoded with information.\n \n The organisation of this information takes on the form of DNA. DNA and mRNA work together to create ammino acids and protiens. And so the asexual entity never dies it is imortal as it reproduces through self devision with each sucsessive genergation being the same one that has been before. This entity is taking Earth Air water and fire and encoding these forms of energy with information all the while obaying universal law. Life is not the energy the Law or the Code it is the way. Ergo consiousness is also the Way.\n \n Now our Bacteria occupies its place with in the cosmic order. It is not, as is nothing an enclosed system. All the while the Bacteria is changeing through the life process its environment. Life changes the molecular structure of the Atomsphere, the composition of the soil, the molecular structure of the water and through its influence on the atmosphere life dicates the frequency of light that is alowed to proceed through the natural green house it has created.\n \n This is not accident. Life simply obays natural laws. Life is the act of creating order from chaos. The biologist fails to distinquish living matter from inert matter because the scientist knows not the WAY. The scientist knows not the universal laws.\n \n And the earth through the life process becomes more apealing for life to \"evolve\". Yet the asexual entity is imortal. And being a God this entity finds no need to become more complex. And so Universal law is enacted and the opposite of life is created. The Antilife of the pandoras box wreaks havok on life. The opposite of the Bacteria is the Virus. The Virus obays the laws. It carries the information of death. It is death. The Virus does not live. It is the opposite of life and distroys all in its path.\n \n And so the imortal strugle is begun. This great battle creates the third force. Life and death give birth to a child. And the Mitocondia is born. The Mitocondria is the consiouness of god and the spirit of life. The bacteria is forced to give up its imortality by takeing in the Mitocondria. The Mitocondria creates a huge amount of energy giving the bacteria the power to reproduce much faster. Yet this energy itself produces free radicals. Obaying the third law duality in all things. The Bacteria is forced to give up its imortality for energy. The free radicals created by the mitocondria attack the DNA code. To protect the code of life the colective gene pool of the bacteria splits into two parts. The plan being each gene pool would preserve the information independantly and only unite to propagate the next generation of life. Sex binds the organism together through the sharing of genetic information. Sex binds the organism together and from the humble bacteria the supper organism is created. Ergo Homosapian sapian. Hence the informational tranceferance system we call life rediscovers imortality.\n \n You are gaining information now. God is the movement of that information, reason purpose. To understand God you must first understand his laws.\n \n This is why science has no universal laws, because they have eyes but they see not, they have ears but they hear not.\n \n To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of God. To them it has been given in parables.\n \n And to thoes who know to them more shall be given\n \n And to thoes who have not, even what they seem to have shall be taken away.",
