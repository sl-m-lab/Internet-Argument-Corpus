   "I just finished watching the video in its entirety and it was this mornings sermon as shown here: \n Do Not Stumble Christians April 18, 2010 Raul Ries Matthew 18:7-10 \n\n \n Congrats Archie I wondered if you were going to once again stick your foot in your mouth and you do not disappoint.\n \n \nTo my shock and dismay nothing jason says he preached on was said at all, and I mean nothing. Here's the link so you can see that April 18ths morning sermon yourself without trusting the link I posted. Calvary Chapel Golden Springs\n\n \n Really? Are you sure? Perhaps you need to look more closely? \n \n \nOnce again jason has created a false, dishonest and bogus issue out of whole cloth in an attempt to demonize christians. The saddest thing is that I'm neither shocked or surprised at his lie. He is after all a reprobate so what is wrong seems right to him and what is right seems wrong to him. This Pastor never attacked homosexuals one time in this sermon, watch it for yourselves and see. \n\n \n Never attacked? See this is hilarious because for one thing, this service was the FIRST of three services Archie.... They stream live each service then loop BACK to the original for archival purpose...\n \n I attended the third service where the pastor made comments about homosexuals, child molesters, and such being stoned to death... He also commented on disobedient children, and linked or rather implied in a subtle manner that gays because they are gay are in the same realm of sin as child killers.\n \n Therefore, his stance on capital punishment was made clear and to me the message became crystal.... I laugh at how you just trip all over your stupid self all over again...\n \n \n \n \nMy question is, why would a homosexual like jason find it necessary to create a completely fallacious and libelous story which demonizes a good man in order to make christians appear hateful when all this man did in his sermon today was pray for all sinners including homosexuals, then post it on the internet when he knows he is lying and defaming a whole group of people in the process? Is this the homosexual version of truth? \n\n \n Archie please.... I never created anything false because I was actually sitting in the service white knuckled when he said these things. I know your trying to sound or look factual but the truth is you don't even know what the hell your talking about and immediately defend someone who's views align to yours in such a way....\n \n And kids lets remember what Archie saw streaming on the internet was the first service looped no the third.... In fact there is no way he could have seen this because they looped it back by the time I got back from eating lunch in Yorba Linda and posted this!\n \n \n \n \nHow many times have homosexuals made up stories out of whole cloth when they believed their lies could never be checked on or proven to be the defamation and libel they are creating just to condemn others unfairly as jason the liar has done here?\n\n \n Oh Archie..... Go pray to your invisible man with your invisible plights and your invisible fallacies... maybe this time he'll listen.... I highly doubt it...\n \n \nI challenge jason to show the timestamp when these things were said rather than attempt to defend his lies with cheap lip service and attacks on me.\n\n \n If the third service was archived and streamed I would be able to do that dipshit. But sadly it is only the first service not the third....\n \n \nStraight up JASON, I'm calling you a liar, now prove you're not!!!\n\n \n I don't need to \"prove\" anything Archie. I have no reason to lie on a pathetic debate forum. I have a life and I'm far too busy to go around trying to \"lie\" about this church.....\n \n Think about it. Well don't cause your head might implode. They have invited the President of the Family Research Council, I've heard this man talk about the \"gay/liberal\" epidemic plaguing the country....\n \n Raul himself made so many offensive comments toward Obama one service an elderly black woman got up and left! They'll also have a Republican congressman speak at a pancake breakfast next Saturday and take questions from people from this spun side of religious politics...\n \n I have no reason to lie about this Archie. I don't grasp at straws and I would have no inclination to posting about what he said unless I felt compelled to do so....",

Also, negative comments about unnammed peoples and entities are often cut. For example, if a pastor is bashing a local business, that's cut.\n They want to 'preach to the choir' but don't want the message to get around to others...who will point fingers at them...or even file lawsuits.\n \n I'm sure some pastors aren't afraid of 'preachin' the WORD' and make a reputation of being hard-core about their beliefs and preaching. They are unadulterated in their quest to present the WORD 'AS IT IS and AS GOD WANTS IT! (Can I get an AMEN Brotha!)'\n But, most will do a step back and self-censor rather than face criticism after a particularly 'spirit filled' sermon.",

This isn't like some Hollywood production where the powers behind the camera direct, edit, produce and determine what the final content of the product is. This is the message of a pastor who is the shepherd of the church he leads, and the content of his messages are sacred reflections of the Holy Spirits working within him so he doesn't just allow camera or production people to edit the content out of his messages.\n \n He, the Pastor would be the final arbiter of the content of his sermon(s) and in no way would he allow some underling to cut the meat out of a message without his direct and prior approval. I don't care what you say, you obviously have no clue about the inner workings or spiritual hierarchy within the church regarding a Pastors spiritual messages. Also, This issue was raised early sunday night by jason, so early that I was concerned that days sermon would not be posted yet. Chuck Smith doesn't post his sunday morning sermons for days in the online archive so I was pleasantly surprised to see how quickly this church works in making his message available to the public, and that also speaks to the point that little time existed to cut and edit the message. \n \n One more thing, the video is 1:18:17 in length. If it was edited, it would have been cut to an hour in length for continuity one would think. But no, it appears to have been posted in its complete form with no editing or cutting at all.

   "[QUOTE=Easyrider;398756]Stone Gays?\n \n \nWell first, Matthew, do you agree that God's moral laws have not changed from the Tanakh? For instance, adultery is a sin in Exodus and Jesus told the adulteress, \"Go and sin no more.\" Jesus also talked in other places about adultery (Sermon on the Mount), and likewise, Paul. So, can we safely say that moral sins were considered sin in both the Old and New Testaments? \n\n \n Here is where you fall down, skin your knee and go crying to mama. Some of God's laws were carried over into the NT by Christians, but many were not. Nice of you to use adultery, but Jesus was quit clear on divorce which doesn't appear to carry the same weight. Maybe you can connect the dots on why adultery is not tolerated, even though the language is significantly mild compared to that of divorce, which is permitted.\n \n So moral sins were considered sins in both. Just not all the of them are the same. Where are the stone tablets like they got in the OT? Why does the OT have thus sayeth the Lord and the NT have Paul an Apostle of our Lord?\n \n Seems whenever God is speaking through a man he let's everyone know, at least in the OT, not so much in the NT. emoticon_confused\n \n \n \nOkay, then what's left is who punishes that kind of sin - God or man? In the New Testament it's God (or government - Romans chapter 13) who dispenses the kind of justice that takes people off the earth (note Annanias and Sapphira in Acts 5, and King Herod - Acts 12, etc.) \n\n \n By your note when you say God you mean the Apostle Peter who was upset that after making the couple sell their property they didn't redistribute their wealth (imagine that and you so many complaints when Obama is accused of doing it) properly. Willing first the husband and then the wife dead for withholding a portion of the sale.\n \n \n \n \nDo you see anywhere in the New Testament where Jesus or anyone else said to stone people for their moral sins?\n \n \n \n Romans, Chapter 1:32\n who, knowing the ordinance of God, that they that practise such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but also consent with them that practise them.\n \n Matthew, Chapter 15:4 Mark, Chapter 7:10\n For God said, Honor thy father and thy mother: and, He that speaketh evil of father or mother, let him die the death.\n \n Timothy, Chapter 1:19\n holding on to faith and a good conscience. Some have rejected these and so have shipwrecked their faith. Among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan to be taught not to blaspheme.\n \n \nNo. Instead, he said, \"Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.\" Now the New Testament says all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. So, Matthew, according to that is there any Christian alive who qualifies to cast that first stone? And if not, then how can we be expected to stone sinners? \n \n So please update your \"I'm a victim\" theology.\n\n \n Now if only professed Christians would act accordingly. Do you mean to say that those calling themselves Christians have acted as you imply they should over the last 2000 years? That the fear and anger is unfounded and not justified or placed irresponsibly at the feet of Christians?",

They had a house together worked together, saved together and so on. His partner died and his brother who had disowned him for being gay (the brother was a Southern Baptist) suddenly popped up to contest the will and being a living close relative was able to take a large portion of what they had built.\n \n Christians get the most criticism for their treatment of homosexuals not because they are the only ones who do it, they aren't and sometimes they are not the worst. They are the most vocal and most politically active in preventing gay and lesbians for being either treated equally or gaining protection because of discrimination.\n \n Gays are beaten, ridiculed, humiliated and yes on occasion murdered for the simple reason of their biology.",

Used to be a divorced woman was thought of in unflattering terms, but it wasn't necessary to protect them because that happened with women's rights. \n \n Adultery is something that is apparent and/or used detrimentally towards the individual except maybe in a few rare circumstances.\n \n I can respect your beliefs regarding moral behavior and your concern over the effects on society, but honestly your never going to ban being gay. If you notice the harder you push to suppress and condemn them the more vocal and open they become. Gay pride was started not as a means to cross dress and flash people. It was in response to the shame gays were made to feel. Stop pushing your belief and you will probably accomplish more than has been in the last 1000 years.",

The second group that was invited = The Gentiles and those Jews who accepted\n 5. The servants = those who preach the Gospel of Christ's salvation\n \n Explanation of the Parable:\n \n God's chosen people, the Jews, were the first to receive the invitation to receive their Savior Jesus Christ, the Son of God whom they rejected. The Wedding / Gospel invitation was then given to others (the gentiles - note Romans 1:16, etc.). In short, everyone had received an invitation, but not everyone accepted the invitation.\n \n Note that the Book of Revelation describes a future marriage of the Lamb (Jesus - John 1:29) and His Bride (Revelation 19:7).\n \n The guest who was not arrayed in the proper wedding attire was one who had declined God's gift of salvation and righteousness - a robe of righteousness that comes not from man, but from God only:\n \n Isaiah 61:10, \"I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels.\"\n \n Note that in Genesis 15:6, this righteousness comes through faith in God: \n \n \"Abram believed (had faith in) the Lord, and it was credited to him as righteousness.\" \n \n Also note Ephesians 2:8-9 in the New Testament.\n \n Believers are covered with God's garment of righteousness / salvation. When God looks at the repentant sinner He does not see the filthy attire of sin, but the robe of righteousness obtained by Christ's perfect obedience to the law. There are none righteous apart from this God-given righteousness. A perfect example that this righteousness is not obtained by man's own inherent \"goodness\" is found in Zechariah chapter 3:\n \n 3 Now Joshua was dressed in filthy clothes as he stood before the angel. 4 The angel said to those who were standing before him, \"Take off his filthy clothes.\" Then he said to Joshua, \"See, I have taken away your sin, and I will put rich garments on you.\"\n \n Filthy clothes = sin in the above scripture, while a robe of righteousness = a garment of salvation in Isaiah 61:10.\n \n From the New Testament we find:\n \n Romans 13:14 - \"Rather, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ...\" \n \n Philippians 3:9 - \"..not having a righteousness of my own that comes from (keeping ) the law, but that which is through faith in Christ...\"\n \n Also note that in Matthew 22:10 - \"...the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.\"\n \n Here we see the illustration of those gathered off the streets - people who may well have not been able to afford special wedding garments on such short notice.

We don't condemn gays, but only homosexuality which is the sin which God condemned. That is the point of my disagreement with Matthew and Jason in every debate. I am not condemning them as people which is evidenced by my insistence that we don't want to kill them in this Age, but must oppose their sinful lifestyle on principle since it is unnatural and goes against what God has for us. Just as He condemns sins which straight people commit, only straight people don't organize and justify their sins while attempting to claim God doesn't mean it anymore. \n \n Show me the adultery pride agenda out there which is fighting for equal rights for adulterers since they are an oppressed group of victims of these hateful moral traditionalists who insist on interpreting the bible as it condemns their lifestyle of sexual debauchery with multiple partners outside of their marriages. Go on, show me other groups which play victims as they corrupt and pervert the truth just as you have done in your post by claiming that we want to condemn any homosexuals, when all we do is correct their defense of homosexuality which is the predominant sin which is destroying them. \n \n None of you secularists can oppose our arguments based on what we actually believe and say to you. You must corrupt our true beliefs and intentions in order to paint us as evil and hateful when it is a deep and sincere love for all men which motivates us to share the spiritual truths we properly interpret from God word.\n",

   "True enough Matthew, your god does accept you and he can't wait to get you into his kingdom, that is why we take the time to share the gospel truth with you, in order to save you from that end.

Of course rather than post your own passages which defend your corrupted position, you just ignore the evidence we offer even though you both insist you are christian believers in Christ. \n \n Then all we get in response is your hate speech which attacks and condemns us for daring to tell you the truth about what homosexuality represents in the real world as it destroys its practitioners. Shame on you jason, I can only imagine how disappointed your parents are at how bitter and hateful you have become as you rebel against the Lord who died for your sins on Calvary's Cross.",
