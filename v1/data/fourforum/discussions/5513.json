Sure there maybe a book deal in the works but because all the publication companies, newspaper and books, now take their cues from \"Homeland Security\" aka Big Brother, ala the MAN (The Great Cowboy) the dirty fingers of our own home grown authoritarian regime is obvious. they will try to silence the blogs next that i asure you and then where will we go when the Democratic Underground site is shut down?\n and most frightening is how Congress just rubber stamp the administration's proclaimations without a word of debate.

   "Someone needs to poll Americans about how they would feel if the US continues with its current level of over involvement through 2008 and the end of the Bush administration? That is realistically what will happen with our non leadership on Iraq reconstruction. I think most Americans would feel disgusted with this administration with the prospect of on going substantial loss of lives and money. \n \n How do we disengage? A significant concession is needed for the Sunnis Muslims. This would not be easy, but it might eliminate a major source to terrorism. The Sunnis feel left out of the process of forming a new government. The Sunni leadership that is currently negotiating with the government to participate does not speak for all Sunnis. The insurgency has continued through their negotiations with no decrease. \n \n A Sunnis country would provide two major advantages for our war on terrorism. Without Sunnis participation, troops can focus on securing Iraq borders. The real 9/11 type terrorists are the ones coming across the border from Saudi Arabia and Syria. Establishing a Sunnis country would once again establish a front line. If they continue terrorism against the Shi'ite Muslims and Kurds, we know their home address. A front line eliminates ambush as a tactic and establishes a conventional war. Saddam was seriously outmatched twice in this type of warfare, and a third time would be no different. \n \n Unfortunately, finding alternatives to muddling through to 2008 may not be possible as long as the Bushit desk warriors are in charge. The military leadership needs to be in charge, as they have strenuously argued for years that they never again want to be put into another Vietnam situation. Desk warriors have taken over again as troops get killed in the role of Iraqi police, all for political goals. This is precisely what the career military people never wanted to see again and why the real military leaders have stressed quick deployment, highly mobile campaigns with no prolonged quagmire type involvements. Franks and Swartzkoph gave us two examples of what can be done in this manner, and it is what the military needs to stick to.",
