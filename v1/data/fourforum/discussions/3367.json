   "I saw the about first half - Cheney was strong, but not enough. Edwards was stuffed full of language, but never really said anything.\n \n I think Cheney was the strongest of what I had a chance to view, but I heard that Edwards took the last portion by a slim margin.\n \n Both, it seemed to me, were more concerned with how they came across than with the issues. I was starved to death for information about half way through, so I turned off the TV and crawled in bed with my wife. :p",

I mean they lie and say that Bush is going to re-instate the draft (when the men authoring the bill are both Democrats), they say that Cheney is still making money from Halliburton (yes, deferred salaries from when he worked there in the 90s), and they urge their fellow Democrats to alter polling data by voting as often as they can to show that Edwards won the debate. Ask any non-partisan who saw the debate, and they will more than likely tell you Cheney won, if not then they will call it a draw. But if you look at the polls you would think that Edwards threw Cheney around like a doll.",

But if you look at the polls you would think that Edwards threw Cheney around like a doll.\n\n \n Amazing how people can watch the same debate and walk away with such different perspectives. Questions on the mishandling of the Iraq war created the same problems for Cheney as they did Bush. Cheney questioned Edwards \"90%\" figure in describing US financing and casualties like the real figure was going to be much different. Does it really matter if it's ONLY 87%, it's easy enough to look up monetary and troop contributions from our so called coalition. All in all, it was about Iraq. If you're happy with what we're doing, you'll vote Republican. If not, there's only one other choice.",

   "I think in order to have won, Cheney needed a knockout. He didn't get one.\n Cheney seemed to me like a guy bluffing with a bad poker hand. Edwards was not dominated which means he won in a way. Edwards was doing damage control on th \"global test\" thing and did so reasonably well IMO. Cheney clearly does not support the anti-gay marriage amendment but has to tow the line. Cheney trotted out the old \"tax and spend\" definition of Dems. which is tired IMO. Edwards suggested we should double our personnel in Iraq which for me is the scariest thing said during the debate. Some of you might not remember when LBJ ramped up our efforts in Vietnam when he probably didn't support the war much himself in the first place.",

   "Both were just jabbing at each other with half empty accusations about attendance records and voting records.\n \n It was funny how Edwards avoided questions about what he would do differntly In Iraq and things like that. I think people will remember that.\n \n BUT, I think there are 2 things that stuck out in my mind:\n Edwards talking about Cheney's House votes. Those votes made him sound like the meaniest bastard on the planet. He voted against Head Start, Meals on Wheels, MLK day, and the kicker, a resolution calling for the release of Nelson Mandella! You have to be a real turd to be against Nelson Mandella's release.\n \n Another thing was Cheney's closing statement. Was it just me, or did it sound like he was saying goodbye?\n \"It's been nice being your VP...\"\n and then he made some Freudian slip and said \"...the next president...uh..\" I thought that was classic.\n \n Anyway, all in all, the whole thing was a push. I'm sure it changed not one mind.\n \n \n .",

   "I thought the debate was mostly a draw. Both had good \"cuts\" at each other.\n \n The one intellegent comment I heard was when Edwards mentioned training the Iraq police/soldiers \"outside\" of Iraq. Although I don't agree with this war, we're there and there's not a thing we can do about it. Training outside of Iraq makes way too much sense. You can't train them if you can't keep 'em alive long enough for the training.",
