And the wages of American workers have shrunk, the value of the U.S. dollar has shrunk.\n \n America is now a puny dwarf because of corporate profiteering.\nExxon's profit margin is lower than you think it might be. Their record profits are due to volume, not gouging.\n \n I note that none of your links refer to profit margin. You either deliberately picked links that made no mention of it, or you are ignorant of what it means.\n \n Coorporate profits are intended to be earned and paid to investors. Exxon's profit margin is only about 8%, meaning they make about 8 cents for every dollar spent in the process of making the 8 cent profit. \n \n I believe the profit margin for the S&P Fortune 500 companies exceeds 10%.\n \n Exxon has done nothing wrong by making a profit. It's the volume of fuel sold that makes their profit seem to be a \"windfall\" that by some twist of socialist logic should be taken away from Exxon's investors.\n \n It's the Socialists and Communists that love this redistribution idea.\n \n http://www.usnews.com/articles/business/economy/2008/02/01/exxons-profits-measuring-a-record-windfall.html\n \n On the margin. The oil industry urges people to look beyond its profits to its profit margin: about 7.6 percent of revenues late last year. That's not much higher than the 5.8 percent profit margin for all U.S. manufacturing, and if you exclude the financially troubled auto industry from that analysis, the oil industry actually appears less profitable than most manufacturers, which were earning 9.2 cents on every dollar of sales.",
