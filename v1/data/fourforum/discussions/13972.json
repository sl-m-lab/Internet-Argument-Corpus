   "From a blog in Connecticut:\n \nAccording to a new study, 8 million Americans went to work infected with swine flu. And 7 million caught H1N1 from a sick co-worker. And don't forget, 24 people in Connecticut actually died from swine flu.\n \n There are a thousand reasons we need a basic workplace standard to allow Connecticut workers to earn paid sick days. But like clockwork, corporate lobbyists are already trotting out the same old canard that it's too expensive for businesses. (As if it's really profitable to make sick employees come to work.)\n\n The Party Line Blog Archive Why paid sick days?\n \n This is the link to the study:\n http://www.iwpr.org/pdf/B284sickatwork.pdf",
