   "Since this is impacting the homosexual community directly, I put it here for greater exposure. Does this seem like an effective way of curtailing the spread of AIDS? It doesn't seem to me that seeking medical assistance for the disease is dangerous as it is evidence of someone else passing it on, but shouldn't have a legal impact on the victim. On the other hand, will it motivate carriers not to be reckless in their sexual practices for fear of irresponsibly passing it on? There are cases of AIDS carriers purposely infecting others out of some sick desire to retaliate for having caught it themselves. Do these laws prevent promiscuity of carriers, or push getting medical attention underground? And if a carrier hides their condition, is that evidence that their valuing the ability to transmit the disease is stronger than seeking help in controlling it? \n More countries make spreading HIV a crime\n \n By MARIA CHENG, AP Medical Writer\n 16 mins ago\n LONDON - An increasing number of countries worldwide are making spreading HIV a crime, according to a new report from the International Planned Parenthood Federation.\n Health officials fear the trend could undermine gains made in fighting the AIDS pandemic and provoke a surge in cases. Globally, about 33 million people are thought to have HIV and nearly 3 million people are newly infected every year.\n \"If the law is applied badly, this could set us back and do incredible damage,\" said Paul de Lay, an AIDS expert at UNAIDS, who was not involved in the report.\n De Lay said the laws could result in forced testing and drive the epidemic underground as people hide their HIV status, allowing the virus to spread unnoticed.\n According to Planned Parenthood, 58 countries worldwide have laws that criminalize HIV or use existing laws to prosecute people for transmitting the virus. Another 33 countries are considering similar legislation.\n Since 2005, seven countries in West Africa have passed HIV laws. In Benin, simply exposing others to HIV is a crime, even if transmission doesn't occur. And in Tanzania, intentional transmission of the virus can lead to life imprisonment.\n Many of the laws in Africa were passed after a meeting in Chad in 2004 sponsored by the U.S. Agency for International Development, the world's biggest funder of AIDS programs, and attended by U.N. officials.\n \"The U.N. was definitely remiss to allow this to happen,\" said Kevin Osborne, a senior HIV adviser at IPPF and one of the report's authors.\n De Lay said UNAIDS found out about the meeting only after it happened.\n But poor countries aren't the only ones using these laws.\n In the U.S., 32 states have laws criminalizing HIV transmission. Experts estimate that thousands of people have been charged across the country with spreading HIV.\n Since 2001, 16 people in the United Kingdom have been prosecuted for spreading HIV.\n In 2005, a woman in Canada was charged with criminal negligence and aggravated assault for passing HIV while pregnant to her baby.\n She did not tell her doctors that she had HIV and did not receive the medications necessary to prevent the virus from infecting her child. She was sentenced to a six-month conditional sentence followed by three years of probation.\n In countries like Britain, Canada and the U.S., which are major donors of efforts to fight AIDS in Africa, such cases are particularly unfortunate, many experts say.\n \"It sets a poor example in the sense that other countries may then think this is an appropriate or desirable way to deal with HIV,\" said Richard Elliott, executive director of the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network.\n While there might be exceptional cases where prosecuting people who are maliciously spreading HIV makes sense, experts said those were extreme cases.\n \"The criminal law is a blunt instrument,\" Osborne said. \"If you put everyone in prison with HIV, then you think you've controlled it. But you haven't dealt with the issues around the intimate behaviors that spread HIV.\"More countries make spreading HIV a crime - Yahoo! News",

   "Since this is impacting the homosexual community directly, I put it here for greater exposure.\n\n Does that mean it should be put on the \"religion\" thread cause Christians get it as well?\n emoticon_xdonno\n \n Once again, people try to tie gays with HIV, ignoring the fact that the vast majority of HIV cases are from straights. Only a small percentage of gays or straights have the disease.\n \n \n \nDoes this seem like an effective way of curtailing the spread of AIDS?\n\n No. I don't believe it is an effective way of curtailing the spread of HIV.\n I support making it a crime to knowingly and purposefully infect another person, but the burden of proof for that should always rest on the prosecution. \"Assuming\" too much can have disasterous effects.\n \n Most HIV infections are not \"purposeful\" infections. They are accidental, and as such would not be affected by this law.\n \n From the article:While there might be exceptional cases where prosecuting people who are maliciously spreading HIV makes sense, experts said those were extreme cases.Even the article admits that the cases of purposeful transmission are NOT the norm.\n \n \n \nIn 2005, a woman in Canada was charged with criminal negligence and aggravated assault for passing HIV while pregnant to her baby.\n She did not tell her doctors that she had HIV and did not receive the medications necessary to prevent the virus from infecting her child. She was sentenced to a six-month conditional sentence followed by three years of probation.\n\n Education is a key to fighting the disease.\n I wonder if this woman knew about HIV and pregnancy. The medical facts.\n That with the right treatment, she could have prevented the baby's infection.\n Education is more important. It is possible she had no idea, and that she assumed she might be prosecuted for \"infecting her child\" just for having one.",

   "AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) - A Dutch court convicted two men Wednesday for attempting to infect 14 victims with HIV in a bizarre sex case.\n \n The Groningen District Court found the two guilty of severe assault for injecting semiconscious men with HIV-infected blood at sex parties between January 2006 and May 2007.\n \n Peter M., 49, who was also convicted of rape, was sentenced to nine years in prison and Hans J., 39, received a five-year sentence. Under Dutch privacy laws, the surnames of convicted criminals are not released.\n \n Prosecutors said they would appeal for higher sentences.\n \n \"By committing these acts, (Peter M.) has shown himself to have a serious lack of respect for the rights of others,\" the three-judge panel's written ruling said. \"While he knew from his own experience what far-reaching consequences are tied to an infection with HIV, he repeatedly attempted to bring this same hurt to others.\"\n \n Prosecutors had argued that the two men, along with a third who was acquitted of major charges, had drugged the 14 victims and intentionally infected them.\n \n But in Wednesday's ruling, judges said while the victims all had HIV, it could not be proven that they were infected by the injections because they willingly took part in orgies where gay men had unprotected sex.\n \n The judges also said allegations the victims were given GHB, known as a \"date rape\" drug, were also unproven.\n \n The suspects were not charged with attempted murder since Dutch courts have held that HIV is a chronic illness rather than an inevitably fatal one.\n\n \n http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D94DL3201&show_article=1",

   "As jyoshu's post show's purposely trying to pass it on happens. But those activities are rare thankfully. What is more diabolical in my opinion is when knowingly infected people continue to have random sex with multiple partners as part of their lifestyle without first informing them that they are carriers, and allowing them the opportunity to choose not to expose themselves by having sex with them. And it goes without saying that this scenario can play ot in either the straight or homosexual community. I'm not attempting to make this a uniquely gay issue here.",

I'm not attempting to make this a uniquely gay issue here.\n\n \n If you look at the infection rate, it's interesting to note that after the 80's crisis the U.S. heterosexual infection rate climbed while the homosexual rate dropped.\n Homosexuals WERE acting conscientious, while straights failed to learn from what they saw amongst straights.\n \n One pitfall of the issue is that if people look at it as a \"gay\" disease, it encourages complicity amongst straights which leads to problems.\n \n \n A 20-year-old man in Mayville, NY, is suspected of infecting at least nine teenagers and women with the AIDS virus.\n \n Officials say Nushawn Williams had sex with 28 women and infected at least nine of them with the AIDS virus in rural Chautauqua County, located 70 miles south of Buffalo in upstate New York. His sex partners may have later infected more than 70 other people, officials say.\n http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_/ai_20028177\n May have infected more than 70 other people...\n And this is obviously a heterosexual example.",
