Here is a press clipping I found:\n \n \nHouse Majority Whip Roy Blunt (Mo.) and House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer (Md.) today introduced legislation authorizing several programs for Special Olympics, including the design and implementation of Special Olympics education programs, the expansion of international participation, and the improvement and implementation of the Special Olympics Healthy Athletes program.\n \n \n Thoughts?",
