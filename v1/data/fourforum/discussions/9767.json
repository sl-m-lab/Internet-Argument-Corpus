These traits are the expression of genes that are copied and passed on to offspring during reproduction. Mutations in these genes can produce new or altered traits, resulting in heritable differences (genetic variation) between organisms.

But as far as I can see Evolution Theory is based on the fact that traits CAN be inherited. \n \n \n True.\n\n \n **\n This is only 'true' when applied to the darwinist notion of evolution, where the evolution/genesis of 'novel' traits, [i.e., 'origins'], is tied to a theory of 'inheritance', i.e., the conservation and preservation of 'old', [i.e., 'derivative'], traits. To anyone but a darwinist this 'explanation' of one phenomenon on the basis of its opposite, a contradicting and contrary phenomenon, is ridiculously irrational. But that's what you get when you let your metaphysic [eg., materialist atheism], dictate your pseudoscience for you, 'a priori'. \n \n \n\n The problem here is that the article is somewhat poorly written.\n\n \n **\n Translation--it says things krony and his cronies do not wish to hear.\n \n \n\n Traits which have a genetic basis are, of course, inheritable. What the article was trying to say is that traits which don't have a genetic basis aren't inheritable, and gave as an example learnt behaviors.\n\n \n **\n Here comes the distortion, deception, and standard darwinian mendacity, folks. Here is what the OP is really all about, as stated in its very first lines--\n \n \"Evolutionary theory ever since Darwin is based on the assumption that acquired traits, such as learnt modifications of behaviour, cannot be inherited by the offspring. Now, a Swedish-Norwegian research group, led by professor Per Jensen at Link&#246;ping university in Sweden, shows that chickens can actually inherit behavioural modifications induced by stress in their parents.\"\n \n Kronus says that when the article says 'inherit', it really meant 'learned'. This is a lie on his part. When the article says 'inherit', it means, 'inherit'. How do we know? Because it next states--\n \n \"The scientists grew groups of chickens under stressful conditions, where a randomly fluctuating day-night rhythm made access to food and resting perches unpredictable. This caused a marked decrease in the ability of the stressed birds to solve a spatial learning task. Remarkably, their offspring also had a decreased learning ability, in spite of being kept under non-stress conditions from the point of egg-laying. They were also more competitive and grew faster than offspring of non-stressed birds.\" \n \n Now so far you might think, well, if they were hatched and raised by their stressed-out, wacky mother hens, then the unstressed chicks still might have just copied [learned] such behaviour from their moms. This, of, course, assumes that the swedish scientists were totally stupid incompetents that they could conduct such an experiment without foreseeing such a development, and therefore neglected to incubate the eggs and raise the hachlings apart from their parents. Personally, I do not automatically assume, as kronus apparently does, that all non-american scientists are just that stupid and short-sighted. How else than that he assumes that the chicks were raised in the presence of stressed-out mothers can he go on to say--\n \n [kronus]\n \"For example, ust[sic] because I've learned to look both ways before crossing the street doesn't mean my offspring will be born with that ability. The article then goes on to confuse learned behavior with behavior that is a result of a change in the environment.\"\n \n I mean, aside from the fact 'learned' behaviour is always a result of some kind of 'change in the environment', be it a 'teacher' or whatever, so making this last sentence absurd, this study bears no relation to some child being 'taught' by its parent how to cross a street safely, nor even an untaught child who somehow survived to learn the trick from copying other people. These chicks, to do that, had to be raised in the presence of their parents, and there is no rational reason to suppose that the swedes were dumb enough to do that.\n \n \n\n The chickens didn't learn to act differently when stressed, that behavior was already programmed in at a genetic level ready to be triggered given the right stimulus.\n\n \n **\n Apart from the fact that this claim is utterly unsupported empirically, and is so nebulous as to be fundamentally vacuous, what is there in the article that prompts kronus to say such a thing? Apparently kronus took this as his cue--\n \n \"To investigate whether there was any genetic basis for the effect, the research group examined the expression levels of about 9000 genes in the brain of the chickens. In birds exposed to stress, there was a number of genes where the expression was either increased or decreased, and the same genes were similarly affected in the offspring.\"\n \n \n N.B.---The 'genes' DID NOT change. The 'genes' in the brain did not mutate. So there goes RMNS darwinism as an explanation for evolved traits in the offspring, right from the jump.\n \n So what did change? The organismic expression of chemically unchanged genes in the brain [behaviour trait centre] in both parent and offspring. BTW, shooting down, one more time, the darwinist, linear, genetic determinist, ' one gene determines one trait' model that has been dead for decades, but is, by kronus and friends, repeatedly being dug back up out of its grave.\n \n Any novel change/mutation in \"expression\" at the organismic level that cannot be directly linked to a novel genetic mutation can only be EAM, aka Devo-Evo, (that is, developmental evolution), a neo-lamarkian phenomenon. Why? Because such a phenomenon nothing whatsoever to do with the darwinist, \"ToE\", that is, that such novel trait changes/'expressions' originate from-- \"Random Genetic Mutation\", coincidentally expressed as some lucky organismic trait that \"Natural Selection\" does not eliminate before it is inherited by offspring. And there simply is no genetic mutation here. What it does show, empirically, are that organismic tyraits are not determined by genetic chemicals, but by the organism's usage of those chemicals to its own purposes and advantage.\n \n \n \n\n And since the genes that give rise to the observed behavior are already there it comes as no real surprise that eggs created while the mother chicken was stressed would have the same genes triggered that result in the stressed behavior.\n\n \n \n **\n And here is the root of the big fat darwinist lie. Kronus equates organismic gene expression with the gene [ a string of bits of acid] itself. He has to do that if he is to remain a darwinist. To accept the truth, (that is, that bits of acid remained the same, but still the organism changed, as a direct result of its changed environment, and that that organismic change/mutation [evolution] was continued in its offspring, without them inheriting a corresponding genetic change/mutation), is to refute all that is darwinist.\n \n Epigenetic inheritance and trait expression {Evo-Devo, EAM} is totally anti-darwininian RMNS, but here, in this article, is one more scientific proof that it is a fact. [As opposed to the darwinian _presumption_ of fortuitous environmental coincidence with a 'spontaneously generated' DNAcid change.]\n \n \n\n This sort of confusion is all too common in science articles written for the popular press. The writers and editors don't necessarily understand the topic they're writing about and so it's quite common for the science to be misinterpreted. I pretty much ignore any conclusions that articles like that reach that aren't direct quotes from the researchers themselves.\n\n \n **\n No, any 'confusion', in the minds of the public, is of the kind deliberately sown by darwinists like kronus in this post,-- meant to obfuscate and obscure scientific facts that contradict their pseudo-scientific metaphysical mumbo-jumbo.",

Because such a phenomenon nothing whatsoever to do with the darwinist, \"ToE\", that is, that such novel trait changes/'expressions' originate from-- \"Random Genetic Mutation\", coincidentally expressed as some lucky organismic trait that \"Natural Selection\" does not eliminate before it is inherited by offspring. And there simply is no genetic mutation here. What it does show, empirically, are that organismic tyraits are not determined by genetic chemicals, but by the organism's usage of those chemicals to its own purposes and advantage.\n\n \n I will stop quoting here. Don't want people to have too big a read. Actually ToE isn't all that random. To a certain degree yes. But Sexual Selection aka a part of the ToE. Dictates that when there is a benificial/attractive change. That change will be enhanced almost exponentially. Because the female of the species will be programmed to search for that and will carry the gene herself so will give it to her off spring. And the male will be more succesfull so produce more off spring. So no instant eyes or anything like that. I think that's what you were implying. \n \n Sorry for responding in Kronus's stead.

I hope you don't mind me replying to some stuff though. \n \n \n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n **\n \n **\n Here comes the distortion, deception, and standard darwinian mendacity, folks. Here is what the OP is really all about, as stated in its very first lines--\n \n \"Evolutionary theory ever since Darwin is based on the assumption that acquired traits, such as learnt modifications of behaviour, cannot be inherited by the offspring. Now, a Swedish-Norwegian research group, led by professor Per Jensen at Link\u00f6ping university in Sweden, shows that chickens can actually inherit behavioural modifications induced by stress in their parents.\"\n \n Kronus says that when the article says 'inherit', it really meant 'learned'. This is a lie on his part. When the article says 'inherit', it means, 'inherit'. How do we know? Because it next states--. \n \n Quote:\n Originally Posted by Kronus \n What the article was trying to say is that traits which don't have a genetic basis aren't inheritable, \n \n I don't know where you read what you read but he was obviously not saying that. \n\n \n **\n If, by 'he', you are referring to Kronus, he most certainly is saying what I say he is saying, when he says, as I quoted in my post--\"Traits which have a genetic basis are, of course, inheritable. What the article was trying to say is that traits which don't have a genetic basis aren't inheritable, and gave as an example learnt behaviors. \" He clarifies what he means by \"learnt behaviours\" going on to say, \"For example, ust[sic] because I've learned to look both ways before crossing the street doesn't mean my offspring will be born with that ability. The article then goes on to confuse learned behavior with behavior that is a result of a change in the environment.\"\n \n So he is telling us a lie, because the article actually says, as you yourself quoted it saying,and I repeated, \"Evolutionary theory ever since Darwin is based on the assumption that acquired traits, such as learnt modifications of behaviour, cannot be inherited by the offspring. Now, a Swedish-Norwegian research group, led by professor Per Jensen at Link\u00f6ping university in Sweden, shows that chickens can actually inherit behavioural modifications induced by stress in their parents.\" [bold mine].\n \n So if you are referring to kronus, then I simply cannot see how you could have failed to see that, in fact that is exactly what 'he', kronus, was in fact saying.\n \n Of course, if by 'he' you mean the article's author, and or the scientists involved, when they say 'inherit', they DO NOT mean 'learned', as in, children who had to 'learn' to look both ways before crossing the street. Not unless, as in this experiment, the parent chickens \"learnt\" how to cross the road, but their chicks 'inherited' that learning, and that's how they 'learned' it, which is a complete confusion and obfuscation of what 'learn' means as opposed to what 'inherit' means.\n \n \n\n [kronus]\n \"For example, ust[sic] because I've learned to look both ways before crossing the street doesn't mean my offspring will be born with that ability. The article then goes on to confuse learned behavior with behavior that is a result of a change in the environment.\"\n \n [ww]\n \"I mean, aside from the fact 'learned' behaviour is always a result of some kind of 'change in the environment', be it a 'teacher' or whatever, so making this last sentence absurd, this study bears no relation to some child being 'taught' by its parent how to cross a street safely, nor even an untaught child who somehow survived to learn the trick from copying other people. These chicks, to do that, had to be raised in the presence of their parents, and there is no rational reason to suppose that the swedes were dumb enough to do that. \"\n \n \n Once again I don't read anything about him saying anything along those lines. << He says the stress caused in the chickens is a concequence of their environment. Not because they are taught how to be stressed. \n\n \n **\n Everybody says that about the stress. But we are not discussing the stress. We are discussing the behaviour trait change, that is, how it was generated, [i.e., NOT by random genetic mutation, but by organismic response to the environment and the stress that environment induced in the organism itself, entire and whole], and, more to point, how it was _inherited_, as opposed to 'learned', and was inherited, 'epigenetically', i.e., non-genetically.\n \n So again I have no idea you are referring to when you say, \"Once again I don't read anything about him [kronus] saying anything along those lines.\" Evidently, you are one of those who kronus very successfully confused altogether about what the article, and he himself, were claiming. Let me put it to you in in a nutshell. What the article, and the experiments authors, claim, and what kronus says they are claiming. are so diametrically oppopsite and contradictory that what kronus believes what he says, then he is merely incredibly stupid, but if, as is more usually the case with darwinists, he is deliberately 'muddying the the waters', then he is, quite frankly, lying to you.\n \n \n\n So you don't have genes in your body that aren't activated? Aka my father has blue eyes and my mother brown eyes. I have 1 blue eye gene in my body yet I don't have 1 blue eye and 1 brown eye. But 2 brown eyes. So it's obviously not active.(ok bad example) Don't know the exact name for it. But don't rabbits have a genetic response hard coded. As every animal. That when they are being chased that they make irratic maneuvres. He says that the chickens had genes that had some hardcoded information about how to respond to certain conditions. They got activated in them. And the same information was passed to the children. \n So they don't come out all big eyed and is mister big teeth my uncle?\n\n \n **\n There is no comparison between inherited eye-colour, which varies according to certain genetic rules, and what is happening here. There is no 'dominant/recessive' aspect to this. You need to read up on this aspect of inheritance. \n \n Just to begin with, you would have to assume that prior to this experiment, under normal environmental conditions, _some_ chickens always inherited an 'allele', or whatever, that caused them to always behave the way the stressed parents behaved in the experiment. But that simply is not the fact of the matter. No chickens had ever before inherited and exhibited those traits, not unless and until they were stressed out by their environments as per the experiment. Even though the genes/alleles were there all along, the novel traits were not. This is nothing at all like what is involved in inherited eye-colour, or any other trait that is 'gene dependent', i.e., genetically determined. Here we are talking 'origins', not 'inheritance'. If both your parents, and their parents, and so on, have brown eyes, then you did not get your blue eyes because your mother was frightened by a horse!\n \n \n\n Actually ToE isn't all that random. To a certain degree yes.\n\n \n **\n Oh, please! You cannot get any more random than having a trait that is determined by a spontaneously generated random genetic mutation that is coincidentally, and fortuitously, well suited to the new environmental circumstance that you 'just happen', randomly, to find yourself suddenly confronted with, while your poor relatives faced with the same environmental challenge, poor unlucky sods, 'just happened' to _not_ have that 'random' but somehow exquisitely well-timed, genetic mutation. Or were simply too careless to conserve/inherit that 'random' genetic mutation for the 4, 5, 6 generations, or the 4,5,or 6 thousand generations, when it was not coincidentally, accidentally, and fortuitously adaptive wrt the present challenge you are facing. You really have to bust a gut to believe this sort of foolishness, but once you are converted, the cognitive dissonance forces you to go on believing it, and trying to make others believe it. That's how religious fundamentalists, cults, and nazis get started, and what makes their insanity so hard to eradicate once it takes hold. And so it is with RMNS darwinism.\n \n \n\n But Sexual Selection aka a part of the ToE. Dictates that when there is a benificial/attractive change. That change will be enhanced almost exponentially. Because the female of the species will be programmed to search for that and will carry the gene herself so will give it to her off spring. And the male will be more succesfull so produce more off spring. So no instant eyes or anything like that. I think that's what you were implying. \n\n \n **\n This is irrelevant to the thread, so I'll skip it.\n \n \n\n Sorry for responding in Kronus's stead. I'm sure he can defend himself but I found it unjust the way you replied to his post and attacked it on foundations that you didn't have.\n\n \n \n **\n No problem. Post away.

In the experiment described in the article there were various genes that got turned on or off when the chicked was stressed, and they also saw that those same genes were active or not in eggs produced by stressed chickens.

   "Regarding the first linked article:\n \n It mentions a number of things - behavioural change, altered gene expression, and the apparent inheritence thereof - which EAM strings together into a story: stimulus begat behavioural change, begat altered gene expression, which was then inherited. It further predicts that, should the stimulus persist, at some point all this will lead to a more 'permanent' genetic novelty.\n \n The gaps in this story are, as ever with EAM, in the 'baton passes', the mechanics by which behaviour supposedly begets altered gene expression, or by which altered gene expression somehow begets novel genes. Nor are the mechanics of the epigenetic 'inheritance' inspected very closely. So does EAM's story ring true?\n \n The first thing to note is the uniformity of the response to the stressful environment. Uniformity implies mechanical, predetermined, implicit in the existing genotype or phenotype of the birds. There is no evidence of a heuristic search.\n \n Next, we have to question how, exactly, the change in behaviour relates to the change in gene expression. Causally speaking, there are several possibilities. The behavioural change could be instigated by the altered gene expression, itself triggered chemically by environmental factors. Or, the behavioural change could cause chemical changes which are the trigger for the altered gene expression. Or, the behavioural change and altered gene expression could be unrelated: independently inspired by the same stimulus via different mechanisms.\n \n From EAM's point of view, the second option is the interesting one. But even there, proximal cause is not the end of the story. If behavioural change was an intermediary between stimulus and altered gene expression, the question becomes: where and how is the gene-expression response to the behavioural change encoded or decided? Are we seeing something akin to our own bodies' pre-programmed responses to physical exertion (eg the building of muscle mass)? If so (and there's no evidence to suggest otherwise), is it appropriate to call this 'evolution'?\n \n A straightforward 'no' would be the answer if that was all she wrote. But there's the matter of inheritance to consider. The offspring of the stressed birds exhibited similarly altered behaviour and gene expression, despite being incubated and raised (once laid) in a stress-free environment.\n \n One thing this immediately tells us is that our third option above, that behaviour and gene expression are independently triggered, is most likely invalid. We are left with behaviour triggering gene expression, or gene expression triggering behaviour. In the absence of a stimulus the question becomes: which was 'inherited', gene expression or behaviour?\n \n It's hard to imagine how the behaviour itself could have been inherited. On the other hand, it's perfectly straightforward to suppose that the chemical trigger to which the parents' genome was sensitive also reached the genes of the embryo while inside the parent. The most likely scenario, then, is that this was the mechanism of epigenetic inheritance, and the associated change in behaviour is an effect, not the cause.\n \n Clearly, epigenetic inheritance is a very different beast to genetic inheritance. Saying that the offspring 'inherited an acquired trait', though semantically correct in the sense that they were born with a phenotypic change their parents acquired in life, is almost entirely misleading when you consider that the offspring also 'acquired' that phenotypic change via the exact same chemical mechanism, just at an earlier stage of development.\n \n Even if the epigenetic mechanism is robust - say for instance the phenotypic change and/or associated behavioural change makes the birds stressed even in the absence of artificial stimuli, making the trait more reliably inheritable over multiple generations - we are still only dickering around within the phenotypic space defined by the genome and its sensitivity to environmental variables. EAM's claim that this can and does 'eventually' result in directed (as in designed and specified, not as in 'intended') genetic novelty remains unsupported.\n \n We must also remember that for every acquired trait that does simultaneously manifest in embryo and parent, there are plenty that don't (such as the response of our bones and musculature to exertion). Nor do which traits are amenable to epigenetic inheritance vary from individual to individual within a species, suggesting that the mechanisms of epigenetic inheritance are hardwired into something they share - ie their genome.\n \n I don't doubt for a second that epigenetic inheritance and phenotypic sensitivity to environmental variables are hugely significant in terms of how creatures adapt. However, we must never forget to ask: what is it that endows a particular species with the specific suite of adaptive epigenetic mechanisms it possesses? So far the answer is always 'their genome', which puts EAM in a rather awkward - forgive the pun - chicken and egg quandary: how did that genetic mechanism get there? How did those chickens become phenotypically sensitive to stress in the way they are? How, in the presence of a novel stimulus, can evolution proceed by behaviour-<epigenetic inheritance-<genetic change when genetic change would be needed first to enable phenotypic sensitivity to that novel stimulus?\n \n In summary, then, while I would be content as a lay-person to refer to the operation of these epigenetic mechanisms as 'evolution' (since they are after all mechanisms by which organisms adapt physically to their environment), I wouldn't say EAM has a strong enough case for relaxing the scientific definition, because it can't yet join up the dots in the way it wants to: novel phenotypic sensitivity to the environment is something novel genes make possible, not the other way around. (NB: in this 'chicken' experiment we're seeing neither; no novel genes and no novel phenotypic sensitivities, we're merely discovering a phenotypic sensitivity those chickens possess).",

I'm curious how it works.\n \n\n \n Is this specific mechanism well known? I doubt it, though it sounds like it is being researched. Is the fact that such mechanisms exist and are common well known? Yes, definately. There are alot of details, but broadly speaking we're talking about promoters and inhibiters. These are chemicals which, simply put, turn genes on or off. One way an inhibitor could work is by binding itself to the appropriate place in a strand of DNA, thus preventing the gene it's bound to from being read. If the chemical can pass through to the developing egg then it would also turn off that gene there as well. There are almost certainly other mechanisms involved in the production of that chemical, and in the production of the chemical which would stop the inhibitor. You generally get several feedback loops going at once, so the exact mechanism involved can be quite tricky to figure out in its entirety.

Since we don't really understand how decisions get made, it's hard to say exactly what the genetic influence is. That said, we know there is some. The introduction of small amounts of certain chemicals into the bloodstream can make an animal (or human) sleepy, aggresive, calm, afraid, happy, etc. So triggering the genes that produce adrenaline will make an organism much more likely to either fight or run then to sit calmly. But if you're asking if there's a gene for the \"scratch in the dirt looking for worms\" action, that seems unlikely to me. More complex actions like that are the result of interactions in the brain, and we're still figuring out how those work.",

But, the original idea that organisms control the behaviour of their own chemicals, responsively, in correlation with environmental stimuli, and that they do this most particularly during development, when their bioform and its operation/behaviour are being passed from one generation to the next, goes back to Lamarck and Von Baer, predating Darwin and Fisher's darwinism, aka, materialist/mechanist spontaneous generation.

Not even in dead organisms. Darwinist's should not be allowed to wave that off with their standard, \"It 'just happens', that's all!\".\n\n \n Quick point: a live organism is physically and electrically distinguishable from a dead one. In those cases where the differences can be sufficiently rectified, life can be restored, which suggests that it is the configuration of the matter and energy in a living organism that causes it to behave differently to a dead organism. The time-worn (my the puns are flowing thick and fast today) analogy is the difference between a square and a round stone: analyse their composition - what is in them - as much as you like and you will find no difference, yet they will behave differently when resting on a slope. WW has thus far been unable to explain why EAM's 'inquiry' isn't analogous to hypothesising a new force 'roundality' that causes these (as far as EAM is concerned) identical lumps of matter to behave so differently.\n \n \nDarwinist's are forced by their metaphysic and its inherent determinism, in this case 'genetic determinism' to assert that that is the case. \n\n \n This is inaccurate. Chemicals can and do influence behaviour, and genes can and do regulate the production of chemicals within the body. Hence, genes can influence behaviour, potentially by their mere presence, or as part of a chain of chemical triggers. As Kronus points out, however, there's no suggestion in Darwinism that there's a 'drink coffee with your lunch' gene.\n \n \nEAM asserts that although much behaviour is automatised and, over repeated expression in continuing generations, is sometimes recorded genetically as a \"systemic habit\", or 'instinct'. But that the organism still originated the behaviour, not the bit of chemical that automatised it, and that, to some degree, the organism still has some control over it. The simplest organisms, the least control, the most complex, [ourselves], the greatest control--conscious volition.\n\n \n However, EAM posits no mechanism for this transcription of behaviour into genes. Funnily enough, Darwinism does: say a particular behaviour (that an organism devises of its own volition) is beneficial, and emulated by the organism's offspring. Over generations, those phenotypes/genotypes most conducive to the pursuit of that behaviour will tend to prosper a little better. Eventually, the decision to behave in that way could become (not more puns surely) a real no-brainer, given the evolved physical tools at the organism's disposal. Genes producing chemicals that bias the organism's thinking in the 'right' direction - even very generally - might also be favourably selected.\n \n The advantage of this hypothesis is that it also handles the multitude of observations where the 'new behaviour' is impossible without novel genes - such as those required to produce more of a particular enzyme so as to bind more readily with a deficient nutrilite.\n \n WW, you often claim that the ToE gives organisms no say in the direction their evolution takes. Try as I might to correct this misapprehension through the use of this kind of illustration, you seem wedded to it; I suspect you like exaggerating the distinction between EAM and the ToE more than you like being right about the ToE :)",

   "\n quote=wascallywabbit;277330]\n Quote:\n The question that is not addressed by the mechanist's simple statement, \"a chemical does something, that's all\", is EAM's inquiry into how and why chemicals do what they do in the complex autopoietic biosystems that we call live organisms, but nowhere else. Not even in dead organisms. Darwinist's should not be allowed to wave that off with their standard, \"It 'just happens', that's all!\". \n \n \n Quick point: a live organism is physically and electrically distinguishable from a dead one.\n\n \n **\n Well, duh, that is my point, after all.\n \n \n\n In those cases where the differences can be sufficiently rectified, life can be restored,\n\n \n **\n Life is never \"restored\", only prolonged. If and when it is impossible to discover those \"physical and electrical\" differences, you've got a dead organism, and you are not going to \"rectify\" that.\n \n \n\n which suggests that it is the configuration of the matter and energy in a living organism that causes it to behave differently to a dead organism.\n\n \n **\n Well of course it is!! That's exactly what I've been telling you all along. Your problem is that you want to trace that \"energy\" back to the four physical forces, and those forces back to something you call \"matter\"-- but you can't. They are all still there, still 'doing their thing', no matter that the live organism is now dead--but now they don't seem to be able to generate that 'energy' you spoke of--no electricity, and so forth. But if they are its source, and the molecules and 'bits of stuff' involved are their source, as well, then why can't they? The 'bits of stuff' are still there!\n \n If you can't play Frankenstein by putting all the organic bits of stuff taken from what were live organisms, put them together, either all at once or a bit at a time, and play games with them electromagnetically and/or gravitationally, and pop up something even remotely 'lifelike', then why the heck can't you, over half a century since Miller/Urey? Simple. You need another energy source apart from the four physical forces. Vitality, is what I call it.\n \n \n\n The time-worn (my the puns are flowing thick and fast today) analogy is the difference between a square and a round stone: analyse their composition - what is in them - as much as you like and you will find no difference, yet they will behave differently when resting on a slope.\n\n \n **\n The point being? Duh.\n \n \n\n WW has thus far been unable to explain why EAM's 'inquiry' isn't analogous to hypothesising a new force 'roundality' that causes these (as far as EAM is concerned) identical lumps of matter to behave so differently.\n\n \n **\n Nonsense. There is no analogy, no comparison whatsoever. The assertion is ludicrous and merits no response. However, if it were the case that round stones rolled uphill, when no others did, then peeling might have a sensible point.\n \n \n \n\n Quote:[ww]\n Darwinist's are forced by their metaphysic and its inherent determinism, in this case 'genetic determinism' to assert that that is the case. \n \n \n This is inaccurate. Chemicals can and do influence behaviour, and genes can and do regulate the production of chemicals within the body. Hence, genes can influence behaviour, potentially by their mere presence, or as part of a chain of chemical triggers. As Kronus points out, however, there's no suggestion in Darwinism that there's a 'drink coffee with your lunch' gene.\n\n \n **\n Wrong. Materialist determinism, which is an inseparable feature of darwinism/geneticism , says that everything that anything, alive or dead, does, (provided that it is physically able to do it), it does mechanically and inevitably because the chain of causation stretching back to 'the big bang' dictates that behaviour. That anything that appears to be choice and volition, i.e., is voluntary, is illusory. Even deciding whether to have two sugars with your coffee, or to murder your wife.\n \n from answers.com\n \n \" de\u00b7ter\u00b7min\u00b7ism (d&#301;-t\u00fbr'm&#601;-n&#301;z'&#601;m) \n n.\n The philosophical doctrine that every state of affairs, including every human event, act, and decision is the inevitable consequence of antecedent states of affairs.\n \n Your are either a \"determinist\", or you are not. If you believe that choice and volition are real, even if only a little bit, then you are not a 'determinist', since with determinism it's all or nothing. If it's not \"all\" , then you are not a determinist. And unless you are a determinist, you cannot be a materialist, and if you cannot be a materialst, then you cannot be a darwinist/geneticist. Not rationally, you can't. But nobody says darwinists are rational.\n \n If you believe that it is possible to believe that there is no qualitative difference between a live organism and a dead one, [they are both just chemicals, no more, no less, just doing what chemicals do], then you are a materialist. If you believe that a materialist need not be a determinist, then please defend that proposition rationally. If you believe that a darwinist need not be a materialist, or one of materialism's clones, and hence, a determinist, than please defend that position rationally. \n Simply pretending that you can be a darwinist without being a materialist, and a materialist without being a determininist, and a determinist but still have real self-control over the least thing that you do, or to refrain from doing something when it is in your power to do it, is simply inane self-contradiction.\n \n More later, if I feel like it.",

   "**\n Well, duh, that is my point, after all.\n\n \n A quick aside, just to clear something up. You're pretty quick off the mark when accusing others of making insulting comments, yet you seem to think it perfectly acceptable behaviour to litter your responses with 'duh' and 'oh, please'. Do you genuinely not perceive these phrases as patronising and offensive? Or do you believe this double standard is appropriate; somehow justified by your comparatively elevated intellect? Or can you simply not help yourself?\n \n \nLife is never \"restored\", only prolonged.\n\n \n Only according to the precepts of Vitalism. What I find significant is that Vitalism refuses to make any statement about when life officially leaves the building except in terms of physical degradation and our current practical ability to reverse it. Yet again, it decides what 'must have' happened after the fact, rather than making a useful prediction. If the dead person was revived, he 'must have' not been really dead.\n \n \nIf and when it is impossible to discover those \"physical and electrical\" differences, you've got a dead organism, and you are not going to \"rectify\" that.\n\n \n Hmm... no, sorry, I'm not sure how to interpret that. When you describe a situation where it's 'impossible to discover' the physical and electrical differences, do you mean that the differences are too small to be detected, or that they're too great to be understood/rectified? If the latter, then you're stating an obvious truism: if you can't fix it, it's beyond help. The failure is in our abilities, not in the underlying principle.\n \n \nWell of course it is!! That's exactly what I've been telling you all along. Your problem is that you want to trace that \"energy\" back to the four physical forces, and those forces back to something you call \"matter\"-- but you can't. They are all still there, still 'doing their thing', no matter that the live organism is now dead--but now they don't seem to be able to generate that 'energy' you spoke of--no electricity, and so forth.\n\n \n Yes, the individual bits are still 'doing their thing' at the molecular level, but their relative arrangement and/or the interactions between them have been disrupted, so the result of them 'doing their thing' is no longer the same. Disassemble a mechanical watch and all its pieces will continue to behave according to their physical nature - but that new configuration will not tell the time.\n \n \nBut if they are its source, and the molecules and 'bits of stuff' involved are their source, as well, then why can't they? The 'bits of stuff' are still there!\n\n \n Again, you're asking \"why can't a square rock roll? It's made of all the same stuff as a round rock! There must be another force at work!\" \n \n Well, ok, its an imperfect analogy because a round rock doesn't 'die' and become a square rock. Better to say you're asking \"If molecules are the source, why can't this broken pocket watch tell time? The 'bits of stuff' are still there!\"\n \n \nIf you can't play Frankenstein by putting all the organic bits of stuff taken from what were live organisms, put them together, either all at once or a bit at a time, and play games with them electromagnetically and/or gravitationally, and pop up something even remotely 'lifelike', then why the heck can't you, over half a century since Miller/Urey? Simple. You need another energy source apart from the four physical forces. Vitality, is what I call it.\n\n \n Or, we just need a more time because it's complicated and difficult. Saying it's impossible because we haven't done it yet would, at various stages in history, have applied to heavier-than-air flight, nuclear fission - pretty much anything we've ever done 'for the first time'.\n \n \nNonsense. There is no analogy, no comparison whatsoever. The assertion is ludicrous and merits no response. However, if it were the case that round stones rolled uphill, when no others did, then peeling might have a sensible point.\n\n \n No, WW, once again you've got it completely backward. If we saw round stones rolling uphill, or even not rolling down, we would realise the known physical forces were lacking, and we would need to consider the possibility of 'Roundality'. The same as if we saw a square stone suddenly roll downhill. Either way, we would be justified in inferring another force at work.\n \n When we look at a living organism, it's perfectly possible that we're seeing a round stone rolling downhill, writ large, because living organisms are all strikingly similar in terms of what they're made of and how they are configured at the molecular level. You have no basis for your inference of an additional force at work, because we never see a round stone not rolling downhill (ie, a dead organism that according to all we know about matter and the physical forces is indistinguishable from a live one) and we never see a square stone start rolling (ie, an object that clearly should be inanimate, like a chunk of metal, nevertheless coming to life).\n \n \nWrong. Materialist determinism, which is an inseparable feature of darwinism/geneticism , says that everything that anything, alive or dead, does, (provided that it is physically able to do it), it does mechanically and inevitably because the chain of causation stretching back to 'the big bang' dictates that behaviour. \n\n \n You wrote a lot more, but that's enough to get the gist. This originated here:\n \n \n One more question (two i realise). Has it been shown that genes control/decide behaviour?\n \n **\n Darwinist's are forced by their metaphysic and its inherent determinism, in this case 'genetic determinism' to assert that that is the case.\n\n \n Even in a deterministic philosophy, your root assertion remains incorrect. Even if an organism has in reality no conscious free will, and makes its decisions mechanically based on its experiences, those decisions are still formed from far more input than its genes alone - therefore, genes do not determine behaviour, they at best influence it, or assist/hinder the pursuit of it through the phenotype.\n \n Your claim is analogous to saying that a mechanistic view of the universe would 'force' me to assert that the design of a car determines the route it will be driven. Clearly that's not the case, regardless of whether I believe the entity behind the wheel has free will. The design of the car might influence the route taken (I suggest you don't take a Ferrari offroad for instance) and it might help or hinder the driver on their way (being faster, slower or more/less agile in the wet), but the idea that it determines everything is just plain wrong.",

You can 'revitalize' that which was 'dying', but still clinging to life, but you can never 'restore life' to that which has actually died.\n \n \n\n What I find significant is that Vitalism refuses to make any statement about when life officially leaves the building except in terms of physical degradation and our current practical ability to reverse it.\n\n \n **\n What else is there to say? A physical biosytem is dead once it, taken as a whole, it cannot access Vitality. A single cell is dead when it can no longer do this, a multi-celled organism is dead when none of its cells can do this. If you want to sub-divide multi-celled, multi-organed organisms, a heart is dead when all of its cells are dead, but the heart owner may not be dead even when his heart is, because he got a new heart to replace it. What is so hard to understand about that?\n \n The fact that, FAPP, a person, or his liver, or whatever, is functionally so far gone that we pronounce him, her, or it 'dead' while it is still dying but still partially alive, makes no never mind to to the fact that there is a quantum measurement dividing life from death, and that quantum is quite simply the last cell to die.\n There is no such thing as a non-quantumized 'continuum' anywhere in the universe. That is the Materialist/Eleatic fallacy dispelled by quantum mechanics.\n \n \n\n Yet again, it decides what 'must have' happened after the fact, rather than making a useful prediction. If the dead person was revived, he 'must have' not been really dead.\n\n \n **\n Exactly. He was not dead, only dying. If you want to establish that this corpse is truly dead before you 'restore life' to it, a la Mary Shelley's fantasy, \n you simply check to see that the last cell has died before you start 'restoring'.\n It's that simple. You can shorten the process somewhat if you like. It would be neat trick ikf you could cut off a gangrenous limb, take that totally dead limb, or organ, or 'brain', or whatever, down to the lab, and 'restore life' to it, then re-attach this newly restored limb, organ, to its grateful recipient. Or maybe some other grateful recipient. I wonder who you would be, if you received the donation of of some corpse's 'rebuilt' brain?

In addition, I have stated that it is easily determined from observation of behaviour as to whether or not a cell is or is not, dead. And yes, I am stating a truism--the truism that once a biosytem is no longer alive, it is dead, and once it is dead, it cannot be 'restored' to life.

There are many strains of HeLa cells as they continue to evolve by being grown in cell cultures, but all HeLa cells are descended from the same tumor cells removed from Ms. Lacks.

A physical biosytem is dead once it, taken as a whole, it cannot access Vitality. A single cell is dead when it can no longer do this, a multi-celled organism is dead when none of its cells can do this.\n\n \n Interesting. So I remain technically alive until 100% of the cells upon which I depend for my life are dead?\n \n \nIf you want to sub-divide multi-celled, multi-organed organisms, a heart is dead when all of its cells are dead, but the heart owner may not be dead even when his heart is, because he got a new heart to replace it. What is so hard to understand about that?\n\n \n None of that is hard to understand.\n \n \nYes, the individual bits are still 'doing their thing' at the molecular level, but their relative arrangement and/or the interactions between them have been disrupted, so the result of them 'doing their thing' is no longer the same. Disassemble a mechanical watch and all its pieces will continue to behave according to their physical nature - but that new configuration will not tell the time.\n \n **\n My point exactly. Again. And Paley's too, for what it's worth.\n\n \n No, WW, my point exactly, to the detriment of your attempt to make yours. I really wish you would stop pretending that this in any way supports your inference of vitalism. Once again, if you could point me to a biosystem in perfect physical working order that was nevertheless dead, or a broken/incomplete biosystem that was nevertheless alive, you would have a case for inferring an additional force at work, something to account for the discrepancy. Since you cannot, you cannot be sure there is a gap for vitality to fill.\n \n \nExactly. So, please answer the question. Why can't they?\n\n \n Because the pieces are in the wrong relative configuration; the movement of one part consequently does not impinge upon another. The difference between the broken watch and the working watch can be described purely in terms of the relative physical locations of its parts, which have been disrupted through excessive wear or external injury. Add electricity to the physical properties we're measuring and you can do the same for an electronic watch. And for all you know, we can do the same with a living or dead organism. The idea that we suddenly need to infer an additional, non physical force has no logical basis.\n \n \nThat's fair. But it's also fair to say that doing the same thing, over and over and over and over, in the expectation that someday you'll get a different result, is irrational.\n\n \n That's probably why scientists try different things.\n \n \nIf we saw round stones rolling uphill, or even not rolling down, we would realise the known physical forces were lacking, and we would need to consider the possibility of 'Roundality'. The same as if we saw a square stone suddenly roll downhill. Either way, we would be justified in inferring another force at work.\n \n **\n Again. My point exactly. I don't have anything backward.\n\n \n Yes, you do, because we don't see anything like that.\n \n \nExactly. Round stones and square stones are identical at the molecular level, so it it is not at the molecular level that their ability to roll resides. The same goes for live organisms and dead organisms.\n\n \n Now it's your turn to make my point for me. The ability of a stone to roll is inherent in its configuration, the relative physical locations of its constituent molecules. As is the ability of an organism to exhibit 'life' behaviour. At no point with either do we need to resort to postulating a novel non-physical force.\n \n \nThis makes no sense. A round stone must, because it is passive, do as the force of gravity requires of it. So must a corpse. \n\n \n As must a wound pocket-watch do as its physical nature requires. And as, for all you know, must a living organism, thanks to its moment-to-moment chemical and electrical configuration, perform whatever the next steps are in the operation of its life processes.\n \n \nDo you deny that live organisms have dynamic abilities that rocks and corpses do not have? If you do, I cannot help you.\n\n \n Live organisms certainly do things that rocks and corpses do not, but as I pointed out, round rocks do things that square rocks don't, thanks to their different physical configuration. Same for working and broken watches. How do you know that the differences between what a corpse and a living organism does aren't also accounted for by the different configuration of their parts?\n \n \nIf you do not, account for them using only the four physical forces that rocks and corpses do have, and then explain why those forces don't have those rocks and corpses out there, dynamically hopping and skipping about, just like us live organisms.\n\n \n Ah, right, it's finally clicked; I understand now where you're coming from. Sorry for being so slow.\n \n You're arguing that if the physical forces were sufficient to animate things, we should be seeing all sorts of things animated by them, yes? So the fact we don't, to you implies that something special must be present in some circumstances. Gotcha.\n \n The reason that line of thinking is mistaken is that it does not take into account how different configurations of essentially the same matter can exhibit very different behaviour. Pile up chunks of plastic and metal and silicon in the right proportions, and you won't get a TV. But configured correctly, the same physical matter can perform wonders. By ignoring the huge physical differences between a living and a dead organism - essentially sweeping them under the carpet by saying 'all the bits are still there' and ignoring the changes to their relative positions - you're falsely eliminating a vast potential for exhibiting different behaviour, a potential which you then invent a new force to explain.\n \n Hopefully now you can see why my hypothesis does not imply that rocks and corpses should be dancing a jig any time soon.\n \n \nthe rest of your statement, that, \"those decisions are still formed from far more input than its genes alone - therefore, genes do not determine behaviour, they at best influence it, or assist/hinder the pursuit of it through the phenotype.\", is, one more time, folks, my point exactly.\n\n \n Sorry, WW, but it really isn't. You claimed that darwinists were forced by their materialist philosophy to assert that genes determine everything. What I've done is shown that to be a strawman by demonstrating that even in a materialist, deterministic philosophy, genes would not determine everything. Understand? Both you and darwinists are united in not believing that genes determine everything. You were wrong to claim that a difference of opinion existed, and the logic you used to arrive at the incorrect assessment of what darwinists 'must' assert was itself faulty.",

   "WW is right. It's funny how darwinists are running from genetic determinism now....but that's not been the story for the past century. ToE was established on a foundation of genetic determinism, and it's funny how now you guys are running from it, yet still wanting to prop up ToE as if it's something other than a stiff corpse:\n \n http://www.twnside.org.sg/title/bad.htm\n \n The Central Dogma formalizes the four basic assumptions of genetic determinism and give them material substance. \n \n 1. Genes determine characters in a straightforward, additive way: one gene-one protein, and by implication, one character. Environmental influence, if it occurs, can be neatly sorted from the genetic. \n \n 2. Genes and genomes are stable, and except for rare, random mutations, are passed on unchanged to the next generation. \n \n 3. Genes and genomes cannot be changed directly in response to the environment. \n \n 4. Acquired characters are not inherited, as germline genes are not influenced by the environment. \n \n These assumptions fit neatly with the dominant neo-Darwinian theory, which says that all of marvelous life on earth evolved, and is still evolving essentially by the natural selection of random genetic mutations. Neo-Darwinism combines Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection with August Weismann's theory of the immortal, inviolable germline, which, through Mendelian and molecular genetics became the Central Dogma. So, there is supposed to be a 'Weismann's barrier' forbidding environmental influences from changing the genes directly, especially in the germ cells that give rise to the next generation. \n \n That is how biologists and the public at large came to see the living world purely in terms of genes and DNA. There are no organisms, only collections of 'selfish genes', all clamoring to replicate. There are no societies of communities, only selfish individuals competing against one another. Dawkins is the best known popularizer of such views. \n \n \"If you look at the way natural selection works, it seems to follow that anything that has evolved by natural selection should be selfish. Therefore we must expect that when we go and look at the behaviour of baboons, humans and all other living creatures, we will find it to be selfish. If we find that our expectation is wrong, if we observe that human behaviour is truly altruistic, then we will be faced with something puzzling, something that needs explaining.\" \n \n The explanation on offer for altruistic behaviour is essentially disguised selfishness. Dawkin's view on the organism, is that it doesn't exist, the organism is just the means for propagating replicators, or genes, \n \n \"We are all survival machines for the same kind of replicator - molecules called DNA - but there are many different ways of making a living in the world, and the replicators have built a vast range of machines to exploit them...\" \n \n \"...Exactly how [genes specifying proteins] leads to the development of a baby is a story which it will take decades, perhaps centuries, for embryologist to work out. But it is a fact that it does. Gene do indirectly control the manufacture of bodies and the influence is strictly one way: acquired charateristics are not inherited...Each new generation starts from scratch. A body is the genes' way of preserving the genes unaltered.\" \n \n \n The greatest danger of this reductionist biology is that we end up denying and explaining away all that is good in organisms and human beings, such as altruism, love and compassion. That is all of a piece with the dominant social reality that glorifies competition and exploitation, of corporate capitalism that makes the rich ever richer and the poor ever poorer. \n \n One has to appreciate that the assumptions of genetic determinism, in one form or another, have been the bread and butter of mainstream biology for at least 100 years, rather the way that Newtonian mechanics had been the foundations of physics in the pre-quantum physics era. Within 10 years of the Central Dogma, however, genetics was turned upside-down. All those assumptions, and more, were contradicted by research findings, from the then newly developed recombinant DNA (rDNA) technology. ",

   "Just to bring SS/WW up to whats going on these days:\n \n \n \nThe 1% Solution\n \n By Constance Holden\n ScienceNOW Daily News\n 13 August 2007\n If humans and chimps are 99% alike genetically, how come we're so different? Scientists have been trying to answer that question for more than 30 years. Now researchers have come up with fresh evidence that the answer lies not in the proteins that genes produce but in the timing and level of gene activity.\n \n In 1975, the late evolutionary biologist Allan Wilson of the University of California, Berkeley, and his then-grad student, Mary-Claire King, published a paper in Science relating that comparison of various proteins and nucleic acids between chimps and humans revealed hardly any differences between the two species. So they proposed that the obvious differences might result from the way genes are regulated. Some support for the assertion has since come from studies of individual genes, such as prodynorphin, an endorphin precursor that is expressed more in humans than other primates (ScienceNOW, 17 November 2005).\n \n Now, a group at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, has performed the first genome-scale survey of promoter regions, DNA sequences that help determine the timing and activity levels of adjacent genes. Using published genomes of chimps, humans, and, for purposes of comparison, macaques, postdoc Ralph Haygood and colleagues in the lab of Gregory Wray analyzed the promoters for 6280 genes that are present in all three species.\n \n By comparing these sequences with nonfunctional promoter sequences (DNA that by comparison with the chimp and macaque versions appears not to have been influenced by selection forces), they were able to ascertain whether a promoter region had evolved quickly, indicating that the trait to which it is linked is adaptive and therefore favorable in human evolution.\n \n The researchers found that the promoter regions for about 575 human genes--especially genes involved in brain function and nutrition--have undergone this selection and are quite different in humans than in chimps. Just what that entails for gene activity is not known, says Haygood, but it means \"evolution has been paying attention to the regulation of these genes.\"\n \n Of the genes whose promoter regions were most affected by selection in humans, many are involved in neural development, including such things as how the axons of nerve cells are directed to form connections with other nerve cells. Haygood says that's not surprising, given the vast differences in behavior and cognitive ability between chimps and humans. More exciting, in his opinion, is that perhaps more than 100 genes relate to carbohydrate metabolism, particularly glucose metabolism. Haygood says it's possible that shifting from the fruit-based chimp diet to one rich in carbs, in the form of roots and tubers, could have provided humans with the energy needed for brain expansion. The team reported its findings online 12 August in Nature Genetics.\n \n Molecular geneticist Sean Carroll of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, says the study offers some \"intriguing leads\" on candidate genes to be followed up. \"There is an important message here\" that changes in regulatory sequences may be important in the evolution of many species, he says.\n \n \"What a nice paper,\" says King, who is now a geneticist at the University of Washington, Seattle. \"Allan must be smiling from heaven.\"\n",

If you were to simply say:\n \n \"The presence or absence of certain internal systemic activities defines whether a thing is alive or dead.\"\n \n that would be fine. What's been causing problems, at least as far as this discussion with me is concerned, is that you have a habit of bolting on the redundant \"which are found only within live systems and nowhere else\", the wording of which suggests that you have divided the world into living and non-living based on some other unspecified criteria, and then observed (found) that only live systems exhibit these activities. Provided you're willing to accept the condensed definition above, I think we can proceed on a common platform of understanding.\n \n \nAgain you make another ch.101 sophist move.\n\n \n Calm down; that wasn't where I was going with this, and where I was heading has been rendered moot by your 'physical key' explanation. \n \n \nAnd I really wish that you'd stop claiming that that which supports my point does not, or that it supports your point, when it does not, with absolutely no support for your assertions, either empirical or logical.

We all have our cross to bear.\n \n Again, now that you've elucidated your 'physical key, psychical lock' hypothesis, I can appreciate why you're having such a hard time understanding the point I'm making here. In both my hypothesis and yours, physical matter needs to be in a particular configuration before it will exhibit 'life' behaviour, so when I point out that requirement, you believe it strengthens your position and I mine, to the confusion of us both.\n \n So let's try again with that in mind.\n \n According to the hypothesis I am defending, matter in certain configurations will, as a result of the operation of physical forces, exhibit behaviour that we would both label as 'living'. You, on the other hand, assert that matter in certain configurations equally mechanically 'unlocks' a psychical force which in turn motivates that matter to behave in a fashion we label as 'living'.\n \n My point with the square and round stone, and the functional/disassembled pocket watch, is to illustrate that rearrangement of matter alone, without invoking a psychical force, can and does evoke vastly different behaviour from the same matter operating according to the same physical forces. That is why I question the validity of your 'inference' of the existence of vitality; it is a god-of-the-gaps in your understanding of the operation of complex chemical systems. You have no evidence - nor can you propose any conceivable method of obtaining any - that such an arrangement of chemicals cannot exhibit this behaviour according to physical forces alone.\n \n Is such behaviour unexpected? Perhaps, but again the failure is in the imagination and comprehension of the beholder - by which I mean no personal slight; the facts are every bit as surprising to me. Similarly Mandlebrot did not 'expect' his famous iterative equation to yield an infinity of fine detail - and indeed it does not, for most inputs. But for a subset of the XY plane that equation, with no help from anything beyond the prosaic axioms of mathematics, goes bananas.\n \n At the end of the day, your inference of vitality stems from nothing more than your surprise and disbelief regarding the physical behaviour of certain chemical systems concerning which, by your own admission, your understanding is strictly limited. \"I don't (want to) believe it works like that so I've decided it works like this instead\" is not a scientific approach.",

Despite it being elevated by the faithful to some kind of scientific insight, a sacred principle of causation.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n In truth, I defined the difference between 'live' and 'dead' on the basis of empirically observed presence or absence of certain internal systemic activities which are found only within live systems, and nowhere else. \n <snip<\n Now if there is 'circular reasoning' in this definition, please show us all where it lies. \n \n \n Hmm. Ok, the tang of circularity here is not in the definition as such, it is in the way you phrase that definition. If you were to simply say:\n \n \"The presence or absence of certain internal systemic activities defines whether a thing is alive or dead.\"\n \n that would be fine. What's been causing problems, at least as far as this discussion with me is concerned, is that you have a habit of bolting on the redundant \"which are found only within live systems and nowhere else\", the wording of which suggests that you have divided the world into living and non-living based on some other unspecified criteria, and then observed (found) that only live systems exhibit these activities. Provided you're willing to accept the condensed definition above, I think we can proceed on a common platform of understanding.\n\n \n **\n I'm not sure what your problem is, or what you are trying to get at?!? When trying to discriminate A from B, the rational approach has always been to narrow the focus to those traits and properties which differentiate the two, not to seek after their similarities. Therefore the way to distinguish that which is alive from that which is dead can only be by finding those traits/properties/characteristics which are always evidenced by the living, but never by the non-living. \n \n So, yes, I am saying that I believe that living organisms do display internal behaviours that are not found in non-living entities. I do not say that all activities found in live organisms are not found elsewhere, but only that some of these activities are not to be found elsewhere. Further to that, I say that when evidence of these activities disappear from an organism, it matters not what other activities persist, at that point that organism has passed, abruptly, from the live state to the non-living state. From life to death.\n \n Now, not being a biologist, I cannot tell you what, specifically, the activities found in live organisms that are not found in non-living entities actually are.\n But I am sure that any biologist could do so quickly and easily.\n Calm down; that wasn't where I was going with this, and where I was heading has been rendered moot by your 'physical key' explanation. \n \n \n\n According to the hypothesis I am defending, matter in certain configurations will, as a result of the operation of physical forces, exhibit behaviour that we would both label as 'living'. You, on the other hand, assert that matter in certain configurations equally mechanically 'unlocks' a psychical force which in turn motivates that matter to behave in a fashion we label as 'living'.\n\n \n \n **\n No, there is a very telling difference between what you think I'm saying and what I really am saying. You are a materialist, and as such, you are totally convinced that all reality starts at the substrate, 'matter', and works outward from there. This leads you to automatically reverse certain statement made by non-materialists such as myself which are totally contrary to that 'world-view'. I know this but often forget, leading me to leave myself open to misinterpretation unless I 'lock down' every word and expression I use.\n \n For instance, in this case, the materialist view is 'matter-based', and is as you say, the ontological postulate that \"matter in certain configurations will, as a result of the operation of physical forces, exhibit behaviour that we would both label as 'living'\". You start with 'matter', and then you imply that 'matter' need only, 'somehow', without point, purpose, guidance or instruction, just 'happen' to fall into certain 'configurations', at which point the so-configured matter 'acts alive', thanks soley to the manner in which it now finds itself, 'configured'. In fact, once matter finds itself in a certain configuration, no matter the reason why, then, mechanically, it MUST 'act alive'.\n \n Which leads you to believe that when I said that when matter is configured in such a certain way, for the same reasons, or lack thereof, \"equally mechanically\" 'unlocks', meaning, 'generates', a psychical force [which I label , \"Vitality\"]. You are now saying that I, like you and other darwinists, believe that matter is the source of all forces, even supposed psychical forces called Vitality. But I don't. I remind you that in my Dynamist philosophy the fundamental substrate of all reality is that ultimate 'force' from which all other forces emanate, and that matter is simply the end product of the four physical forces. And that those activities seen in material systems that we call 'living', are the end product of the psychical force, Vitality. That means that the 'configurations' that allow Vitality to operate in the physical universe, as live bioforms, did not 'just happen', but were generated by Vitality, and life is when the configuration is able to 'access' the Vitality that shaped it originally, and then, by 'feedback', enable further 'configurations', that is, lifeforms that more fully access Vitality.\n \n The key words in your confusion are that you took my word, 'access' [The ability to approach, enter into, communicate with, or make use of], to mean, 'generate'[To bring into being; to give rise to; To produce as a result of a chemical or physical process.]. \n \n In sum, my position is that Vitality is what caused the first configurations of material bits through which it was partially able to 'act' in the universe, and that evolution is an ongoing process whereby live organisms redesign themselves using Vitality, in its various psychical aspects, [intelligence, volition, etc.], so that Vitality can more fully express itself through live organisms. It is the Vitality that rules-the 'configured matter' is only its artefact, but the artefact, the 'configuration', the 'form', the 'design', of that matter is the product of Vitality, and is not something that 'just happens, that's all'.\n \n \n \n\n My point with the square and round stone, and the functional/disassembled pocket watch, is to illustrate that rearrangement of matter alone, without invoking a psychical force, can and does evoke vastly different behaviour from the same matter operating according to the same physical forces.\n\n \n **\n \"Rearrangement\" is such an easy word to say. I suggest that 'rearranging' a rock so that it is square takes a lot of talent, sweat, and willpower. You never find square rocks sitting on grassy nolls. Indeed, you never find perfectly round and roly-poly rocks there, either, and for the same reason. Nature [meaning the four physical forces], has never, unaided by Vitality, produced a square or round rock suitable to your illustration, and never will. Nor will the four physical forces ever, unaided, invent a watch, build its pieces, and arrange them such a way that they enable someone [who has the schooling] to tell the time of day with some degree of accuracy. So until you can come up with something that does not beg the question of the necessity/involvement of Vitality [in the generation and 'rearrangement' productive form] in your effort to deny the necessity/existence of Vitality, you are just spinning your wheels. \n \n \n Break time.",

   "WW, What are the units of vitality? What instruments can I use to measure it? You have elsewhere called it a force, so it is external to organisms, right? How is it transmitted? How is it recieved? Or how does it act on them? How exactly is an organism or a cell vitalized by an input of vitality? Do bigger organisms require more vitality than small ones? How much more? Is the requirement proportional to body length, body mass, or what? When a heart is transplanted, it is inactive after being cut out, and then it reactivates after being reconnected and shocked, but what happens exactly with respect to vitality - did it retain some vitality (and if so, where), or what? Does death come as the result of an inability to intercept vitality (perhaps with near-death being a state of diminished ability to intercept vitality), or does death have other causes? If vitality was capable of animating the first life, and if vitality is everywhere, then why do cells die - why doesn't a dead cell that is bathed in standard levels of vitality spring back to life? \n \n How much does a vitality field diminish as it passes through an organism? Can one organism that overgrows another block the latter's reception of vitality or use up its portion? Is it possible to set up an artificial vitality blocker? Do you think we will eventually be able to store vitality artificially and use that to prolong life? Is it possible for an organism to recieve twice as much vitality as it needs (perhaps having a better than usual reception mechanism, or a higher intensity field), and if so, what happens? How do organisms limit their interception to just what they need, or does the excess simply translate into extra growth, like plants with sunlight and fertilizer? Do dead limbs in trees indicate a failure in transmission of vitality from the rest of the tree to the dead branch, or is it a direct reception thing in each cell? Do animals need more vitality than plants? Do viruses need vitality? Is there always enough vitality to go around, even in environments overflowing with life, like rainforests? If so, then what happens in deserts, where there must be a great excess of vitality going unused - is that ever a problem for the few organisms living there (can they OD on vitality)?

   "WW has already answered some questions about vitality over at ARN, but it took me a while to track them down. They are at http://www.arn.org/ubbthreads/showflat.php?Cat=0&Number=30319282&page=0&fpart=1&vc=1\n \n Let's begin with questions of measurement.\n Glurk asked, \"Is there a way of measuring the force of vitality?\"\n \n WW replied \n Yes. The exact same way that we measure the 4 \"physical\" forces. From their empirical effects upon the behaviour of the physical. The difference being that with it we observe the psychical operations of whole systems, rather than the mechanical reactions of particulate 'stuff'. That means that reductionism, so much a part of the examination of passive, inanimate 'particles', and their interactions, great and small, is useless, indeed obstructive, in the study of complex, especially autopoietic, systems. Including organisms and larger biosystems, all the way up to the biosphere as a whole system. \n\n \n I then proposed a set of units, because science requires starting with clear definitions and precisely defined units, because quantification and measurement are clearly desirable. I proposed basing it on the bacterium Mycoplasma genitalium because it was long thought to have the the simplest known genome, except for viruses and the very recently discovered Nanoarchaeum. It is well known, as it has been sequenced, it has had quite a bit of experimental work done on it, and it is very easily cultured in the lab (whereas Nanoarchaeum lives in near-boiling water). I initially proposed to standardize vitality as the amount of vitality in 10^6 individuals of Mycoplasma genitalium, which we should refer to as 1 turner. \n WW objected to this (in his usual charming fashion) on the grounds that \n Regarding wells' silly post. As explained in my latest post to glurk, forces, including vitality, are not material, and therefore they themselves cannot be quantified, since forces do not possess the material property of extension. Therefore, as I clearly pointed out, matter, and material systems such as organisms cannot 'contain quantities' of a 'magic potion' called Vitality. Wells is simply trying to reify a force. For anyone who, like wells, still cannot grasap the concept, you can say that a pumpkin weighs 100 kilos at sea level. You cannot say that a pumpkin 'holds a dozen units of gravity' at sea level. Got it, wells? \n \n \n I'm just trying to investigate Mike's concept, so what he says goes here. I read his objections as essentially being directed at my use of \"in\". I still think Mycoplasma makes a nice standard, but we should tweak the definition so that 1 turner is the strength of vitality required to vitalize 10^6 Mycoplasma in their normal operations. In gravimetry, one measures the strength of a gravitational field in gals (also in Newtons and Gee's): a gal is a measure of the force in terms of units of acceleration, specifically 1 gal = 1 cm/sec2. I still don't know what turners convert to in other units, but it is at least a measurement that we can work with to ask how much vitality is needed for certain operations, etc. \n \n A bit later in the thread, WW suggested, \n All systems of measurement are arbitrary constructs developed from an arbitrarily established, but universally agreed upon, basic unit. The obvious basic unit of Vitality is the basic unit of life--the live cell, and its Level of Autopoietic System Productivity. Or LASP. That is, the most basic, primitive level of cellular autopoiesis, i.e., the simple ability to process energy and information in order to maintain and reproduce itself as its own self, as 1 LASP. And another cell of greater complexity and productivity as [has?] 2 or more 'LASP's, depending upon its level of complexity and productivity as discovered , through its behaviours, in the range, variety, of the self-generated, dynamic,, non-mechanical, non-random, complex and productive behaviours it generates for itself. And then on, as we do with inches to feet, feet to yards, and so on, to organised collectives of cells, as per eusocial bacteria, slime moulds, yeasts, etc., plants at various levels, and other eukaryotic systems at various dynamic levels of organismic complexity and productivity, as determined from the range and variety and numbers of their various behavioural responses, as contrasted with the mechanical, strictly chemical, passive reactions found in inanimate matter, including the inanimate matter manipulated by the biosystem, whole organism, itself.\n \n I think that if we can perceive any 'difference in degree' in any phenomenon, then we can gradate [measure] it. That includes psychical phenomena like intelligence and emotion, for which such measures have already been devised. If you find my suggested measuring system for the expressed level of Vitality in any given organism, feel free to criticize, since my suggestion is just 'off the cuff', and I'm sure others could do much better, if they had the will to do so. For myself, I am more interested in identifying what power enables autopoietic behaviour, than in measuring it quantitatively. Quantitative measurement is strictly for the 4 physical forces, for physics and chemistry. For Vitality and its psychical phenomena, you need to leave materialist/mechanist quantitative measurement behind, and use a qualitative 'system of measurement'.\n\n \n So, according to the final discussion, vitality is a force, and there should be a basic unit of vitality, so it should be measurable. It appears not to be discrete or quantized, so if a basic cell had 1 LASP then a slightly bigger and more complex cell could have 1.03 LASPs, and so on. (Also, the amount of vitality in one M. genitalium is 1 microturner, which should equal 1 LASP.) Mike initially claimed that vitality, being non-corporeal, does not increase or decrease according to the number of cells interacting with it, \"no more than gravity increases in quantitative correspondence to the number of apples on the tree\". However, since gravitl attraction does in fact increase in correlation with the weight of apples on the apple tree (F = G m1 m2 / d^2) and since he clearly just said that one cell could have one LASP whereas a bigger cell could have 2 or more LASPs, thus the initial objection reflects an unfortunate confusion on the part of mturner, and does not otherwise represent a problem.\n \n Mike, any comments or corrections so far?\n \n I do have one question for clarification at this point: most forces can be 'used up' in doing some kind of work or being transformed into some other phenomenon, but gravity (in the general relativity sense of being a phenomenon of curved space time) is different. If the earth suddenly had a second moon, identical to the present one in mass and distance but opposite in its orbit, the earth would simultaneously pull on each moon with exactly the same 'force of gravity' that it currently pulls on the present moon alone. (Each moon would add to the overall gravitational field, but the earth's pull would not be 'half this way and half the other'.) So does vitality get used up like an electrical current, or is it like gravity, or something else? \n \n So, you avoided rather than answered the original question of how to measure vitality. You assume/define it to be the amount that vitalizes a cell, but that is an assumption without an independent verification. What sort of instrument should we use to measure the vitality field? We use gravimeters, magnetometers, and voltmeters to measure those fields, so what should we do here? If, perchance, you can't come up with a vitalometer to measure vitality, then you are merely be assuming its existence and indulging in a tautology. How can you tell that it really exists?\n \n More tomorrow.",

Just stick with \"Living organisms exclusively exhibit certain internal processes.\" You cannot logically add the caveat \"those processes being the ones we find living organisms to exclusively possess\" because that renders the whole definition circular and meaningless. \n \n [QUOTE]No, there is a very telling difference between what you think I'm saying and what I really am saying. <snip<\n \n \nYou start with 'matter', and then you imply that 'matter' need only, 'somehow', without point, purpose, guidance or instruction, just 'happen' to fall into certain 'configurations', at which point the so-configured matter 'acts alive', thanks soley to the manner in which it now finds itself, 'configured'. In fact, once matter finds itself in a certain configuration, no matter the reason why, then, mechanically, it MUST 'act alive'.\n\n \n That's pretty much it, yes.\n \n \nWhich leads you to believe that when I said that when matter is configured in such a certain way, for the same reasons, or lack thereof, \"equally mechanically\" 'unlocks', meaning, 'generates', a psychical force [which I label , \"Vitality\"].\n\n \n Er, what? WW, you described the notion of a physical 'key'. You used that specific word - now you're bollocking me for saying it 'unlocks' something? Not only that, but you're saying I 'mean' generates? I mean 'UNLOCKS', as in ACCESSES.\n \n \nYou are now saying that I, like you and other darwinists, believe that matter is the source of all forces, even supposed psychical forces called Vitality.\n\n \n No, I'm not, WW. You're just projecting your strawman idea of what a 'darwinist' thinks onto me and filtering my words through it. I did not state, imply or insinuate anything of the sort. I simply summarised what you told me: that matter in certain configurations accesses the vital force, which is what motivates it to behave in the manner we call 'alive'. If you prefer, I'll go a step beyond your definition and remove any suggestion of a causal chain: that matter in certain configurations is suitable to be accessed by the vital force, which then motivates it to behave in the manner we call 'alive'.\n \n \nThat means that the 'configurations' that allow Vitality to operate in the physical universe, as live bioforms, did not 'just happen', but were generated by Vitality,\n\n \n Then how did the first configuration that allowed Vitality to operate in the physical universe come to be?\n \n \nThe key words in your confusion are that you took my word, 'access' [The ability to approach, enter into, communicate with, or make use of], to mean, 'generate'[To bring into being; to give rise to; To produce as a result of a chemical or physical process.]. \n\n \n Nope, totally wrong; your paranoia is showing :)\n \n \nIn sum, my position is that Vitality is what caused the first configurations of material bits through which it was partially able to 'act' in the universe,\n\n \n Logically impossible. How can vitality cause something that allows it to first act? That's a pretty big logical hole, coming from someone who goes ballistic at the idea of differential reproductive rates 'causing' something (like a change in the distribution of genes in a population, for instance).\n \n I note that your accusations about me using 'unlocks' to mean 'generates' has served as a smokescreen to cover up the fact you didn't address the really important point, namely the inevitability of a given configuration of matter, should it arise, accessing vitality. Do you plan to comment? Because as things stand, it would seem that your claim that 'restoring life' is impossible doesn't hold up; one would merely need to properly configure the matter in question and vitality would step in and do the rest.\n \n \nNor will the four physical forces ever, unaided, invent a watch, build its pieces, and arrange them such a way that they enable someone [who has the schooling] to tell the time of day with some degree of accuracy. \n\n \n Apart from, say, a nice sticky-up rock on a sunny day. Unlike flat rocks, they can tell the time.\n \n No, never mind, I'm just messing with you. Of course nature will never produce a mechanical pocket watch. I chose that for my analogy because it is unambiguously not fuelled by vitality, and yet performs activities that the same matter in a different configuration does not. The point was not to suggest that such a configuration could arise via an evolutionary path, merely to illustrate that complex behaviours do not automatically require us to reach for novel forces to explain them.\n \n Imagine a caveman happening across such a watch. The jewelled mechanism inside would be incomprehensibly complex; the finely balanced ratios between the gears something he would not even think to notice or wonder about, let alone understand. Would he believe it to be of supernatural origin, even alive? I don't doubt it; cavemen have believed stranger things than that. Were it to break or wind down, could he repair it? Or would he perhaps believe its vital spirit had escaped and was gone for good? Could he take the parts of two broken watches and fashion a whole working one from them? No. Does his failure make it impossible to repair or rewind a watch, or combine the parts from two to create a working whole? No.\n \n So here we are, faced with something orders of magnitude more complex still: biological mechanisms. Now the workings are so tiny and delicate, so fast moving, that we have great difficulty even observing them in a non-destructive fashion. Should we be like the caveman, and reach for the supernatural just because something dwarfs our understanding? Should the fact that our abilities to fix these mechanisms are fairly limited lead us to believe that the task is impossible, or that once again some vital spirit has departed?\n \n \nSo until you can come up with something that does not beg the question of the necessity/involvement of Vitality [in the generation and 'rearrangement' productive form] in your effort to deny the necessity/existence of Vitality, you are just spinning your wheels. \n\n \n The problem there is that I can't ever give you an example that won't beg that question in your mind, because you explicitly refuse to educate yourself sufficiently in the field of biochemistry to narrow the gap your vitality god is filling. So long as that remains the case, you will always be able to say \"I don't understand how that could be possible without Vitality, therefore Vitality is required.\"\n \n In truth, I believe your motives are very similar to those of creationists. While they are disgusted by the idea that we share ancestry with the other apes, you are disgusted by the idea that we are not qualitatively different from other matter. And just as it does not appease creationists to observe how far we have elevated ourselves, so it does not appease you to be told 'Yes, we're just matter and physical forces - but aren't they amazing?'\n \n Before we go any further, I really would like to see you retract the erroneous statement you made earlier:\n \n \nOne more question (two i realise). Has it been shown that genes control/decide behaviour?\n \n **\n Darwinist's are forced by their metaphysic and its inherent determinism, in this case 'genetic determinism' to assert that that is the case.\n\n \n I quickly and clearly showed this to be false (even in a fully deterministic universe, genes are not the only input and therefore can only be one influential factor), but so far you have not retracted the statement or admitted your error.

And another cell of greater complexity and productivity as [has?] 2 or more 'LASP's, depending upon its level of complexity and productivity as discovered , through its behaviours, in the range, variety, of the self-generated, dynamic,, non-mechanical, non-random, complex and productive behaviours it generates for itself. And then on, as we do with inches to feet, feet to yards, and so on, to organised collectives of cells, as per eusocial bacteria, slime moulds, yeasts, etc., plants at various levels, and other eukaryotic systems at various dynamic levels of organismic complexity and productivity, as determined from the range and variety and numbers of their various behavioural responses, as contrasted with the mechanical, strictly chemical, passive reactions found in inanimate matter, including the inanimate matter manipulated by the biosystem, whole organism, itself.\n \n I think that if we can perceive any 'difference in degree' in any phenomenon, then we can gradate [measure] it. That includes psychical phenomena like intelligence and emotion, for which such measures have already been devised. If you find my suggested measuring system for the expressed level of Vitality in any given organism, feel free to criticize, since my suggestion is just 'off the cuff', and I'm sure others could do much better, if they had the will to do so. For myself, I am more interested in identifying what power enables autopoietic behaviour, than in measuring it quantitatively. Quantitative measurement is strictly for the 4 physical forces, for physics and chemistry. For Vitality and its psychical phenomena, you need to leave materialist/mechanist quantitative measurement behind, and use a qualitative 'system of measurement'. \n \n \n So, according to the final discussion, vitality is a force, and there should be a basic unit of vitality, so it should be measurable.\n\n \n *I*\n Whoa. Again, as with all forces, any measurement of Vitality cannot be direct, but via an arbitrary standard universally adopted for measuring its effects on observable entities. At one time, without any understanding of space or mass, we devised ways [a king's thumb length, the number of carob seeds needed to tilt a balance] to measure them in practical terms. Measuring quantities, via the invention of numbers, arithmetic, and criteria as above, is relatively easy, since quantitative measurements are easy to 'grasp', pun intended.\n \n Not so for qualitative measurements, which measure, or try to at least simplify reductively, changes in states. The primitive beginnings of our understanding of states began with solid, liquid, and gas--that is, states of material substance. These provided an early cross-over to more abstract states, such as thermal energy. We simply devised the concept of temperature, and after noticing certain constants in nature that corresponded to heat, i.e., the point at which water freezes, and the point at which it boils [at sea level], we were able to devise a graduated scale that 'quantified' temperature as the amount of expansion and contraction along a length of mercury in a thermometer. And from that, better but basically similar measuring devices and criteria have arisen. \n \n Much the same sort of thing has been done with electro-magnetic phenomena, and to a lesser degree, the nuclear forces. But with purely psychical phenomena, such as the intelligence in a thought, or the pain in an unrequited love, or the will power in a pair of battling bull moose, or the creativity and forethought involved in nest-building or hive-making, we are still at the most primitive beginnings in our understanding of Vitality, simply because we do not, and cannot, immediately apprehend, 'grasp', such things the way we can when we drop a rock on our foot, put a finger in a candle flame, or into a wall socket. For one thing, we have to use intelligence and imagination in order to work out a methodology for quantizing intelligence and imagination, which not the same thing as using intelligence and imagination on stuff that has no intrinsic,, or is not, intelligence, imagination, or any other aspect of Vitality.\n \n But the outcomes of certain activities,[ lick a frozen pipe, decide to invade Iraq], be they physical or psychical, are equally perceptible, empirical, amenable to scientific study, and so it only requires a bit more intelligence and imagination on our part to devise a method of, if not measuring/quantizing the abstract/non-physical/psychical force, Vitality, in the same way we do the four mechanical forces. That is, of at least rendering it's effects more scalable [see IQ scales] and predictable, and thus understandable. It just won't be as easy as it was to determine how many potatoes made a peck. \n \n \n\n Mike initially claimed that vitality, being non-corporeal, does not increase or decrease according to the number of cells interacting with it, \"no more than gravity increases in quantitative correspondence to the number of apples on the tree\". However, since gravitl attraction does in fact increase in correlation with the weight of apples on the apple tree (F = G m1 m2 / d^2) \n\n \n **\n Neil, allow me to clarify before you go on. I said that \"Gravity\", per se, does not increase nor decrease depending upon the number of massy particles it interaxcts with. Now, as a materialist who believes that massy particles are the source, the sub-strate, the 'that which generates' \"Gravity\" in the first place, you naturally interpret the fact that the amount of gravitational attraction found in one point in space, i.e., an apple tree or a 'black hole', is dependent upon the quantity of massy particles contained within its 'space', that this somehow contradicts my contention that the amount of \"Gravity\" found within the boundaries of 'all space', i,e, the universe, is never magnified, increased, or diminished, but remains constant in all but distribution. \n \n In my cosmology, the four mechanical forces are constant in degree, and pre-exist the 'matter' they generate. A force, such as gravity, can exist independently of mass-bearing particles [which are generated, initially, by the nuclear, sub-atomic forces], but gravity is the force that moves mass-bearing particles ['mass' is an aspect of 'inertia', but no time to go into that here],and a particle that has 'mass' can be transferred from one defined point to another, concentrating it here while decreasing it there. But the force, per se, never gets greater or lesser, overall. See the law of 'Conservation of Energy', thermodynamics, and so forth.\n \n \n \n\n and since he clearly just said that one cell could have one LASP whereas a bigger cell could have 2 or more LASPs, thus the initial objection reflects an unfortunate confusion on the part of mturner, and does not otherwise represent a problem.\n\n \n **\n Well, to start, I'll remind people that my proposed theoretical unit of 'measurement' for Vitality is founded upon systemic 'productivity', which is founded upon 'efficiency', meaning 'more bang for the buck', meaning less energy input wasted/misdirected in the systematic process of teleological achievement of a desired/intended outcome. I called it, \"Level of Autopoietic System Productivity\", or \"LASP\". I would think that such 'efficiency', as an aspect of 'productivity', would be measurable not only in terms of physical energy inputs,say, 'calories', but in terms of the amount of _time_ required to achieve a goal, and the degree to which the achievement is _specific_ and _satisfactory_ to the each and all of particular requirements of the particular case. \n In biosystems, i.e., organisms, the intended outcomes/goals are, fundamentally, basically,--\n a/survival of identity, either individual or group/collective identity,\n b/ individual or group prosperity and 'well-being', which is an aspect of 'survival', and usually,\n c/ re-production, which is also an aspect of 'identity survival', individually or collectively understood. \n \n \n Now, above, neil says that I said that in all such cases, wrt autopoietic cells, 'bigger is better'. I would say that I said the exact opposite applied, in most cases. I certainly never said that in order to contain two 'units of LASP', a cell would have to be physically larger than a cell that contained only one, although it might happen that a larger cell did so, in some particular case. Here is what I actually did say, which, you will notice, has nothing to tod with the physical property of extension, i.e., 'size', that neil has twisted it to mean with his use of the word \"bigger\"--\n \n \"That is, the most basic, primitive level of cellular autopoiesis, i.e., the simple ability to process energy and information in order to maintain and reproduce itself as its own self, as 1 LASP. And another cell of greater complexity and productivity [has] 2 or more 'LASP's, depending upon its level of complexity and productivity as discovered , through its behaviours, in the range, variety, of the self-generated, dynamic,, non-mechanical, non-random, complex and productive behaviours it generates for itself. \" [emph.added]\n \n \n\n I do have one question for clarification at this point: most forces can be 'used up' in doing some kind of work or being transformed into some other phenomenon, but gravity (in the general relativity sense of being a phenomenon of curved space time) is different.\n\n \n **\n As above, I would suggest to you that in reality no force can be 'used up', but only dissipated instead of concentrated at some point in space/time.\n \n \n \n\n If the earth suddenly had a second moon, identical to the present one in mass and distance but opposite in its orbit, the earth would simultaneously pull on each moon with exactly the same 'force of gravity' that it currently pulls on the present moon alone. (Each moon would add to the overall gravitational field, but the earth's pull would not be 'half this way and half the other'.) \n\n \n **\n Yes, it would, since it would express the same amount of mass in its massy particles, via gravitational attraction, in all directions, distributed equally, whether there was one moon, two, or no moons at all. A pond is just as aqueous if there is one duck, none, or a thousand of them floating on it. The only way to alter the intrinic gravitational attraction of the earth would be to add or subtract massy particles from it. The gravitational field that is the earth's alone does not increase with the addition of one or more moons and their fields, but their combined gravitational field is obviously greater than that of any one of them alone. There is no difficulty here.\n \n \n\n So does vitality get used up like an electrical current, or is it like gravity, or something else?\n\n \n **\n As I've said, none of these forces get 'used up', like the gas in a tank. They can be dissipated or concentrated. Concentrating the force of Vitality is part of being a productive, efficient, goal-achieving autopoietic system. Systems that are built out of material particles are subject to entropy, so systems that are efficient and concentrate a force to achieve a certain end can become become inefficient and dissipate and waste that force until that end is no longer achievable. In organisms we call that, 'death'. The life force, Vitality, is still 'out there', but the physical part of the system can no longer be used to the achievement of those ends. Just as a broken engine won't power a car, no matter how much gas is still in the tank. [Sloppy analogy, I know, but I'm just trying to make a simple comparison, so let's not belabour it, OK?]\n \n \n\n So, you avoided rather than answered the original question of how to measure vitality.\n\n \n **\n I most certainly did not!!\n \n \n\n You assume/define it to be the amount that vitalizes a cell, but that is an assumption without an independent verification.\n\n \n **\n I never said word one about any \"amount\" of Vitality. That's just you, as a materialist, automatically concretizing the abstract, just as you did earlier with your \"bigger cell\". What I have always really said is that an LASP is a unit for measuring the productive efficiency of any organism in achieving the expression of Vitality in a material universe, starting at 0 for dead organisms, going to basic units that achieve the basic identity goals of survival, well-being, and reproduction in either an individual or collective sense, and more aspects of viality as the efficiency of the biosystem is developed, in evolutionary fashion, so that the most complex variations of these systems, such as ourselves, can express aspects of Vitality that are beyond the physical capacities of others, and more than are required for the simple basic life goals, per se. (Another simple-minded comparison, but think Ferrari versus roller-skates with an eye to getting from A to B. ;)\n \n \n\n What sort of instrument should we use to measure the vitality field?\n\n \n **\n Specifically, we don't yet know. Generally, something that demonstrates the efficiency involved in the time and energy required by an organic system to achieve a certain specified goal, along with a measurement of the number and variety of possible specified goals achievable by such a system over a broader spectrum of cases.\n \n \n \n\n We use gravimeters, magnetometers, and voltmeters to measure those fields, so what should we do here? If, perchance, you can't come up with a vitalometer to measure vitality, then you are merely be assuming its existence and indulging in a tautology. How can you tell that it really exists?\n\n \n So you are saying that up until the invention of \"gravimeters, magnetometers, and voltmeters\", people who spoke of gravity and electromagnetism were \"merely be assuming [their] existence and indulging in a tautology.\"?!? \n \n \n\n More tomorrow.\n\n \n **\n Okey-doke.",

   "First, thank you for a considered response.\n \n 1) \n So, you avoided rather than answered the original question of how to measure vitality.\n I most certainly did not!! \n\n Well, you did, and you continue to be a little light on the specifics....\n Specifically, we don't yet know [what sort of instrument we can use to measure it]. Generally, something that demonstrates the efficiency involved in the time and energy required by an organic system to achieve a certain specified goal, along with a measurement of the number and variety of possible specified goals achievable by such a system over a broader spectrum of cases.\n\n However, you have addressed it a little more here, so let's examine what you have to say.\n \n \n What I have always really said is that an LASP is a unit for measuring the productive efficiency of any organism in achieving the expression of Vitality in a material universe, starting at 0 for dead organisms, going to basic units that achieve the basic identity goals of survival, well-being, and reproduction in either an individual or collective sense, and more aspects of viality as the efficiency of the biosystem is developed, in evolutionary fashion, so that the most complex variations of these systems, such as ourselves, can express aspects of Vitality that are beyond the physical capacities of others, and more than are required for the simple basic life goals, per se. (Another simple-minded comparison, but think Ferrari versus roller-skates with an eye to getting from A to B.\n\n So you need a LASP to be a unit of utilization. \n \n I can't agree with vitality as an efficiency or a time to completion of task. I agree with Chemist above, that efficiencies are inherently dimensionless ratios (unless you are for some reason putting the numerator and the denominator into different but interconvertible units, like watt-hours / kilojoules). Efficiencies can't effect anything, but can only affect the speed and energy utilization with which the result is effected.\n \n Also, you could only define LASPs [\"Level of Autopoietic System Productivity\"] in terms of time to achievement of completion of a task if you have already defined a standard flux for vitality, which in turn will require some underlying units, just as the # of seconds to boil 1 g of water is meaningless unless you specify a fixed or standard influx of X calories per second, which in turn requires that we've already defined the calorie. So, I don't agree with you on efficiency. \n \n However, you mention \"productivity\", so you would apparently prefer to approach vitality less directly, which suggests work accomplished per unit time. \n In biosystems, i.e., organisms, the intended outcomes/goals are, fundamentally, basically,--\n a/survival of identity, either individual or group/collective identity,\n b/ individual or group prosperity and 'well-being', which is an aspect of 'survival', and usually,\n c/ re-production, which is also an aspect of 'identity survival', individually or collectively understood. \n So how about making 1 microturner as either the input of vitality or flux of vitality need to take one Mycoplasma genitalium from the cell division that produced it through to the cell division that produces its daughters (i.e., one complete generation), or it could be the minimum flux needed to sustain it at rest per second? That way, a LASP could be defined as a flux, such as so many microturners per second. Otherwise we'd be doing something like measuring consumption, such as g O2 / sec.\n \n \n 2) Arbitrary standard - okay. (I still like specifying an organism for your LASP or my 'turner\", and I think Mycoplasma genitalium is a good choice due to its simplicity and how much we know about it.)\n \n Quantitative vs qualitative measurements. I agree that measurements often start out qualitative or semi-quantitative, but you can't do much science with that. Nobody got anywhere with heat until we had a good temperature scale. I'll buy that it's early days for vitalology, but surely validated techniques and units of measurement are needed, otherwise how do we know that we aren't talking about phlogistons and the ether?\n \n 3) Gravity. If gravity is the effect of a curvature of space-time by mass, then I don't see how it could predate the existence of mass. However, some physicists talk about alternate theories with gravity waves and gravitons, so I'll let that pass. It is more important here to focus on the nature of vitality.\n \n \n 4) So are you saying that the total amount of vitality is a constant, but that local amounts can suffer changes in concentration / intensity, that it can be transferred and redistributed? Right? \n \n So you wish to proceed with a model of conservation of vitality, patterned after energy, with a fixed amount created at the outset, and subsequently redistributed? Although we talk of conservation of energy, we can of course increase or decreases the amount of energy sensu stricto by transforming it back and forth from mass (E=mc^2). Is it premature to ask if vitality can similarly transform, and if so to what?\n \n \n 5) Does a bigger or more complex cell require additional vitality? \n \n Now, above, neil says that I said that in all such cases, wrt autopoietic cells, 'bigger is better'. I would say that I said the exact opposite applied, in most cases. I certainly never said that in order to contain two 'units of LASP', a cell would have to be physically larger than a cell that contained only one, although it might happen that a larger cell did so, in some particular case. Here is what I actually did say, which, you will notice, has nothing to tod with the physical property of extension, i.e., 'size', that neil has twisted it to mean with his use of the word \"bigger\"--\n \n \"That is, the most basic, primitive level of cellular autopoiesis, i.e., the simple ability to process energy and information in order to maintain and reproduce itself as its own self, as 1 LASP. And another cell of greater complexity and productivity [has] 2 or more 'LASP's, depending upon its level of complexity and productivity as discovered , through its behaviours, in the range, variety, of the self-generated, dynamic,, non-mechanical, non-random, complex and productive behaviours it generates for itself. \" [emph.added]\n\n \n Sorry, you are misreading what I said (I did not say that a cell would have to be bigger to contain double the vitality), but the same may be true in reverse as well. I assumed from your 1 LASP, 2 LASP bit that you were acknowledging that a cell that did more would need more LASPs, such as a eukaryote cell needing a minimum of 1.4 lasps (or whatever), while a Mycoplasma can get by on 1.0. I was merely assuming that a larger cell would need more vitality on the basis that in cells and organisms, bigger nearly always means 'needs more', like grams of oxygen per hour, or whatever. \n \n So what exactly will and what will not require more LASPS, or LASPs/second? I'm open to options here. You seem to be claiming that more LASPS or LASPs/sec will be needed for:\n Greater productivity (e.g., doing more over one generation, or having more offspring)\n Increased complexity\n Decreased efficiency of use of vitality (How do we know that life can vary in its efficiency in use of vitality?) \n Going for extra style points (Ferrari vs roller skates)\n \n How about<b></b>: \n Longer generations?\n Higher activity levels?\n Faster resting metabolisms?\n Greater intelligence?\n \n But not increased size alone, right? \n \n \n 6) Can vitality be 'used up'?\n \n As above, I would suggest to you that in reality no force can be 'used up', but only dissipated instead of concentrated at some point in space/time.\n\n So we should be thinking of energy as an analogy for vitality? Even though the energy content of the universe is constant, we certainly do use up usable or concentrated energy / mechanical energy, by dissipating it as heat, etc. Thus we convert mechanical energy to entropy. So does life convert usable vitality to 'vitentropy'? \n \n Incidentally, can life restore 'vitentropy' back to 'usable vitality', or are we headed to some sort of 'vitality death' akin to the 'heat death' of the universe? \n \n You refer to \"Concentrating the force of Vitality is part of being a productive, efficient, goal-achieving autopoietic system.\" So systems have to 'feed' on Vitality, or 'breathe it in' or some in some way collect it and concentrate it within the cell? \n \n How do they do that? Which part or parts of a cell does that job? Do we have any ideas or evidence here at all how cells can do such an important job? Or have I driven the concept off your rails again?\n \n \n 7) \n As I've said, none of these forces get 'used up', like the gas in a tank. They can be dissipated or concentrated. Concentrating the force of Vitality is part of being a productive, efficient, goal-achieving autopoietic system. Systems that are built out of material particles are subject to entropy, so systems that are efficient and concentrate a force to achieve a certain end can become become inefficient and dissipate and waste that force until that end is no longer achievable. In organisms we call that, 'death'. The life force, Vitality, is still 'out there', but the physical part of the system can no longer be used to the achievement of those ends. Just as a broken engine won't power a car, no matter how much gas is still in the tank. [Sloppy analogy, I know, but I'm just trying to make a simple comparison, so let's not belabour it, OK?] \n\n \n So death happens because of a failure to gather / concentrate / utilize vitality? Is that just one additional cause of death, or do you mean this to be the final cause of all death, such that strangling, shooting, poisoning, beheading, disembowelling, defenestration, extreme flattening, electrocution, drowning, breathing zyklon B, surfeits of lampreys, emphysema, cancer, getting eaten by a lion, old age, heart attacks, and so forth are all ultimately lethal because they interfere too much with the organism's ability to gather and utilize vitality?\n \n \n 8) \n So you are saying that up until the invention of \"gravimeters, magnetometers, and voltmeters\", people who spoke of gravity and electromagnetism were \"merely be assuming [their] existence and indulging in a tautology.\"?!?\n Not precisely. The key is becoming quantitative about these topics, and developing units and formulas for calculation. Newton certainly worked out his theory of gravity prior to measuring the force of gravitational attraction. However, the development of measuring instruments certainly helped quantify and characterize (and therefore understand) electromagnetic forces. While discussion remained semi-quantitative, whatever people might have said on those subjects had very little scientific worth. \n \n My point about tautologies is more that you are indulging in one here. You have an explanation that talks about Vitality but cannot actually demonstrate it independently from your assumptions.",

   "I never said word one about any \"amount\" of Vitality. That's just you, as a materialist, automatically concretizing the abstract, just as you did earlier with your \"bigger cell\". What I have always really said is that an LASP is a unit for measuring the productive efficiency of any organism in achieving the expression of Vitality in a material universe, starting at 0 for dead organisms, going to basic units that achieve the basic identity goals of survival, well-being, and reproduction in either an individual or collective sense, and more aspects of viality as the efficiency of the biosystem is developed, in evolutionary fashion, so that the most complex variations of these systems, such as ourselves, can express aspects of Vitality that are beyond the physical capacities of others, and more than are required for the simple basic life goals, per se.

I've been saying that Natural Selection is nothing more than a meaningless, trivial, truism for many. many years. I can't believe that this is the first time you've heard me say it. Of course, you ascribe explanatory powers to the fact that organisms that survive long enough to leave offspring, leave more offspring than those that don't survive that long, but I do not. And that is the sum total of any truth involved in your \"RMNS\", because it is the only fact that applies universally within your entire, \"theory\".\n \n \n\n Quote:\n I'm not sure what your problem is, or what you are trying to get at?!? When trying to discriminate A from B, the rational approach has always been to narrow the focus to those traits and properties which differentiate the two, not to seek after their similarities. Therefore the way to distinguish that which is alive from that which is dead can only be by finding those traits/properties/characteristics which are always evidenced by the living, but never by the non-living. \n \n \n No, sorry, WW, but you're doing it again. One minute you're talking about defining life in terms of internal activities, the next you're talking about those activities being the ones you find are always evidenced by the living but never by the non-living.\n\n \n **\n Duh, yeah, of course I am. What's your point? If I was trying to differentiate a circle from a square, I would do so by determining the geometric properties that define a circle as being those geometric properties that are found in circles, but in no other geometric figures; including squares, rectangles, octagons or what have you. What's your problem with that?!?!\n \n \n\n If you're looking to see what living things have in common with each other but not with the non-living, then you must already have partitioned the two groups somehow.\n\n \n **\n Yeah, and Euclid would not have differentiated between a circle and triangle if something hadn't clued him in to the fact that they were, somehow, quite different from one another, before he starting working out what those properties were. I wonder what led him to his suspicions of difference?!? Duh.\n \n The fact of life and of being aware is that, without being taught, we live organisms can discriminate one thing from another using only our senses of perception. No need to analyse it, until pressed by a skeptic. Even kittens can tell a live bird from a dead bird, and so \"partition\" the set of \"all birds\" into two sub-sets, \"live birds/dead birds\". Without any thought a child knows a wooden block from a ball, and \"partitions\" his/her world accordingly. Every person on earth who is not a materialist/mechanist/darwinist knows that organisms come in at least two kinds--live and dead. And further to that, that, with chicken or eels for example, its really hard to eat the live ones. Your arguments are turning as bizarre and silly as ch's usually are. So of course I had \"partitioned\" organisms into 'live or dead'. Did it 60-odd years ago. How come you haven't yet managed to do what every 8-wk. old kitten can do? How come you object that I can, have, and repeatedly continue to do so?!?\n \n If you were not a materialist/darwinist, I wouldn't have to analyse the quality of being alive in order to demonstrate to you that those things that the world says are 'alive', have properties that everything else does not. It would as self-evident to you as it is to every non-darwinian on the planet.\n \n But since you, to save your materialisdm/mechanism/positivism, and therebye save your atheism, deny the self-evident fact that there is a real, qualitative difference between a live chicken and a dead one, especially in a hot frying pan, I am forced to labouriously lay everything out for you. \n \n So here is my syllogism. a/All entities can be said to be either alive, or non-living.\n b/The difference between things said to be alive, and things said to be non-living, can be found in certain observable properties that pertain only in the case of things said to be alive.\n c/ Therefore, whether there is a real difference as opposed to artificial between that which is said to be alive, and all other things, depends upon the demonstration that traits, properties, states and powers exist that can _only_ and _always_ be found in those things that are called alive, but never in anything else.\n \n I would start by saying that all live things are operating, productive, complex autopoietic systems.\n \n Therefore, anything that is not a 'system' is eliminated, including basic particles. \n Simple, non-productive systems need not apply.\n Complex, productive systems that are not autopoietic need not apply.\n \n So now what remains is simply to determine, in their particulars, what properties all complex, productive autopoietic systems always possess that everything else does not, and make those the real, empirically observable criteria that analytically 'differentiate' the quick from the dead.\n \n \n\n That's ok: nor could I, and it's not the point anyway. Just stick with \"Living organisms exclusively exhibit certain internal processes.\" You cannot logically add the caveat \"those processes being the ones we find living organisms to exclusively possess\" because that renders the whole definition circular and meaningless. \n\n \n **\n No, it does not. It merely makes it redundant, because it says the same thing twice. You have these words in quotes, meaning that I actually mispoke myself this way. But so far as I can tell, this is what I actually said--\n \n \"In truth, I defined the difference between 'live' and 'dead' on the basis of empirically observed presence or absence of certain internal systemic activities which are found only within live systems, and nowhere else.\"\n \n --and this bears no resemblance to what you \"quote\" me as saying. In my statement the only redundancy is is the tag, \"and nowhere else\", used legitimately for emphasis.\n \n \n \n\n Quote:\n Which leads you to believe that when I said that when matter is configured in such a certain way, for the same reasons, or lack thereof, \"equally mechanically\" 'unlocks', meaning, 'generates', a psychical force [which I label , \"Vitality\"]. \n \n \n Er, what? WW, you described the notion of a physical 'key'. \n\n \n **\n I believe I did, but not, so far as I can discover, in this thread. I would be grateful is you would direct me to the exact post in this or another thread where I used the analogy of \"a physical key to a psychical lock\", so that I can see just exactly what I did say. The first mention of it in this thread that I can find is an allusion you make to it in your post #51.\n \n \n\n You used that specific word - now you're bollocking me for saying it 'unlocks' something? Not only that, but you're saying I 'mean' generates? I mean 'UNLOCKS', as in ACCESSES.\n\n \n **\n First, it is not true that I am \"bollocking\" you for saying it that the physical parts that together configure the system act as a 'key', nor for saying that that that 'key' \"unlocks something\", implying that the material 'bits' that make up the key are what get the job done, while ignoring the fact that it is not the physical substance out of which a key is made so much as its abstract design, or 'cut', that determines whether or not it 'unlocks' anything. And diminishing the fact that design is abstract, not physical, and so a 'key' is not a purely 'mechanical' implement, like a hammer or crowbar. It is the 'information' in the 'cut' that relates to the lock design that does the locking and unlocking,--the physical substance of the key is just a medium for that psychical message. \n \n I was, taking your words---\n \"According to the hypothesis I am defending, matter in certain configurations will, as a result of the operation of physical forces, exhibit behaviour that we would both label as 'living'.[/quote]\n \n **\n That is your position, yes, but I do not agree with it. I have never attributed 'design', 'configurations', or 'key cuts' to \"the operation of physical forces\", but only and always to the operation of psychical forces directing and controlling physical forces to the attainment of a teleologically sought after goals. And that includes the configurations that 'bits of stuff' take in live biosystems. So I object when you twist my words to say, as you do here-\n \n \" You, on the other hand, assert that matter in certain configurations equally mechanically 'unlocks' a psychical force which in turn motivates that matter to behave in a fashion we label as 'living'.\"\n \n Because I made and make no such assertion of mechanical/physical causation, and your word, 'unlocks', in context, implies, 'unleashes', 'generates', [as, for example, in an atomic explosion], where my 'access' means 'to make available'[for use]. Now you say that 'to make available' is all you intended by your \"unlocks\", but it still doesn't look that way to me. \n \n My first statement in this chain, post #35, is this--\n \"A physical biosytem is dead once it, taken as a whole, it cannot access Vitality.\"\n \n If you mean 'accesses' as I do there, that is, 'to make available for use', then my only problem is your attribution of 'life traits' to the undirected, unintelligent, and unintentional physical/mechanical causation of random configurations of material substances, instead of to informed, intentional, and productive designs expressed in material substances making the actual cause of those traits, i.e., Vitality, available for that purpose. \n \n \n\n Quote:\n You are now saying that I, like you and other darwinists, believe that matter is the source of all forces, even supposed psychical forces called Vitality. \n\n \n **\n More ch. style word-twisting. I actually said that you darwinists, who deny the very existence of Vitality, attribute all of the 4 physical forces you do admit of, to the generating power of 'matter'. \n \n \n\n No, I'm not, WW. You're just projecting your strawman idea of what a 'darwinist' thinks onto me and filtering my words through it. I did not state, imply or insinuate anything of the sort. I simply summarised what you told me: that matter in certain configurations accesses the vital force, which is what motivates it to behave in the manner we call 'alive'.\n\n \n **\n Not true, as explained above. You made it plain that you thought that certain accidental 'configurations' of matter, in and of themselves, were wholly responsible for the unleashing of, generation of , a psychical force, Vitality, in the same sense that you believe that the 'matter' which makes up the planet Earth is what generates the gravity, a physical force, associated with it. Instead of the other way round, as I see it. Wherebye gravity, in part, generates the planet Earth, and Vitality generates the designs, using matter, which, as organisms, allow it to further express itself in the universe. \n \n \n\n If you prefer, I'll go a step beyond your definition and remove any suggestion of a causal chain: that matter in certain configurations is suitable to be accessed by the vital force, which then motivates it to behave in the manner we call 'alive'.\n\n \n **\n But it is causation, \"the causal chain\", that is the entire point of this debate!!\n And the word is not, \"motivates\" when applied to particulate matter, which know nothing of motivation, but rather, \"enables\", or just plain, \"causes\". \n \n \n\n Quote:\n That means that the 'configurations' that allow Vitality to operate in the physical universe, as live bioforms, did not 'just happen', but were generated by Vitality, \n \n \n Then how did the first configuration that allowed Vitality to operate in the physical universe come to be?\n\n \n **\n I would say that Vitality operates upon particulate matter at all times, but only under certain circumstances, as per the robust anthropic principle, does it successfully enable systematized configurations of matter to access it and through them extend its self-expression.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n In sum, my position is that Vitality is what caused the first configurations of material bits through which it was partially able to 'act' in the universe, \n \n \n Logically impossible. How can vitality cause something that allows it to first act? \n\n \n **\n You are assuming that Vitality does not act until matter allows it to. Until matter 'unleashes' vitality. But Vitality pre-exists matter, just as the other forces do. And Vitality exists before lifeforms exist. The first lifeforms configured/designed or caused by vitality further enable its expression; they do not generate it, or originate its expression. They simply help increase and expand it. There is no logical 'catch-22' in this.\n \n \n\n That's a pretty big logical hole, coming from someone who goes ballistic at the idea of differential reproductive rates 'causing' something (like a change in the distribution of genes in a population, for instance).\n\n \n **\n No hole here. And I have no idea where you dreamed up the notion that I ever denied, let alone, \"went ballistic\" the fact [no \"notion\" there] that \"differential reproductive rates\" result in (I'm not sure in what sense, \"cause\"), \"a change in the distribution of genes in a population\" [which is your 'definition' of evolution itself, g*d help us!]. That's another truism, a triviality, a tautologous statement of fact that remains utterly meaningless, and is no different from your \"Natural Selection\". Scientifically speaking, they're both worth a great big, \"So what?!?\".\n \n \n\n I note that your accusations about me using 'unlocks' to mean 'generates' has served as a smokescreen to cover up the fact you didn't address the really important point, namely the inevitability of a given configuration of matter, should it arise, accessing vitality. Do you plan to comment?\n\n \n **\n Being a materialist/mechanist, and therefore a determinist, you would consider the question of \"inevitability\", of primary importance. I do not. But I would say that since the reson that the universe, its laws and forces and constants exist, is so that eventually Vitality, or the source of Vitality, can use it as a 'mirror' with which to come to realise itself, I'd say the odds were very good. But not inevitable, because determinism destroys freedom, which destroys creativity, which defeats the the entire purpose of the exercise.\n \n \n\n Because as things stand, it would seem that your claim that 'restoring life' is impossible doesn't hold up; one would merely need to properly configure the matter in question and vitality would step in and do the rest.\n\n \n **\n You are assuming that the simple configurations that enabled the first organisms to express the facets of vitality that define 'life' were not necessary just as they were, and that we can do what vitality did, and that the complex configurations (developed over billions of generations of vitality-driven evolution) which exist today, would serve that purpose equally well. Sort of like trying to chop down a tree with a broken chainsaw. Vitality can no more 'jump-start' a dead organism than a jolt of electricity can put life back in a dead frog, or a dead cell.\n You further suppose that the particular physical environment that allowed vitality to shape those first systems is also unnecessary to the task of re-starting the creation of simple life forms today.\n \n I submit that your assumptions are ill-founded.\n \n \n Quote:\n Of course nature will never produce a mechanical pocket watch. I chose that for my analogy because it is unambiguously not fuelled by vitality, and yet performs activities that the same matter in a different configuration does not. The point was not to suggest that such a configuration could arise via an evolutionary path, merely to illustrate that complex behaviours do not automatically require us to reach for novel forces to explain them.[/quote]\n \n **\n But complex behaviours, like those of live organisms and pocket watches, do automatically require us to look beyond the 4 physical forces to explain them, because, quite frankly, the 4 physical forces cannot and do not explain them. That was Paley's point, and it still stands. \n \n \n\n Imagine a caveman happening across such a watch. The jewelled mechanism inside would be incomprehensibly complex; the finely balanced ratios between the gears something he would not even think to notice or wonder about, let alone understand. Would he believe it to be of supernatural origin, even alive? I don't doubt it; cavemen have believed stranger things than that. Were it to break or wind down, could he repair it? Or would he perhaps believe its vital spirit had escaped and was gone for good? Could he take the parts of two broken watches and fashion a whole working one from them? No. Does his failure make it impossible to repair or rewind a watch, or combine the parts from two to create a working whole? No.\n\n \n \n **\n All of this is pure red-herring. It has no bearing on the issues involved here.\n \n \n \n\n So here we are, faced with something orders of magnitude more complex still: biological mechanisms. Now the workings are so tiny and delicate, so fast moving, that we have great difficulty even observing them in a non-destructive fashion. Should we be like the caveman, and reach for the supernatural just because something dwarfs our understanding?\n\n \n **\n I'm sorry, but just where exactly do you see me \"reach for the supernatural\"?\n Your problem is that your metaphysic demands that you define anything that is not demonstrably physical and mechanical as \"supernatural\". That's your limited understanding of what is or is not 'natural' to this universe, and certainly no objective finding of fact. Just because a concept like Vitality dwarfs your materialist/mechanist understanding, that is no justification for labeling it, 'supernatural'.\n \n \n\n Should the fact that our abilities to fix these mechanisms are fairly limited lead us to believe that the task is impossible, or that once again some vital spirit has departed?\n\n \n **\n Why not? Why shouldn't they. Even though I have been speaking of a natural force, and not some \"departed spirit\", as you would like to spin it, the present facts we have point in that direction, and until we have followed up the indications, scientifically, and shown them, empirically and/or logically, to be false and misleading, you have no right to slough them off as meaningless.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n So until you can come up with something that does not beg the question of the necessity/involvement of Vitality [in the generation and 'rearrangement' productive form] in your effort to deny the necessity/existence of Vitality, you are just spinning your wheels. \n \n \n The problem there is that I can't ever give you an example that won't beg that question in your mind, because you explicitly refuse to educate yourself sufficiently in the field of biochemistry to narrow the gap your vitality god is filling. So long as that remains the case, you will always be able to say \"I don't understand how that could be possible without Vitality, therefore Vitality is required.\"\n\n \n **\n Oh, wow! You and chemmy went to the same sophistry school, alright!! I clearly show you the logical fallacy in your argument, and you try to \"blame\" my detection of the glaring fault in your thinking on my lack of training, i.e., , indoctrination, in your dogma and its many metaphysical assumptions!! Instead you resort to snide \"vitality god\" remarks. Hey, unless and until you can show, logically and/or empitically, that your assertion that the 4 physical forces, despite a ton of prima facie evidence to the contrary, are perfectly sufficient to the generation of live organisms, then it is you people who are talking irrationally, not me.\n \n \n\n In truth, I believe your motives are very similar to those of creationists.\n\n \n **\n No matter what you \"suspect\", my motives in all this are to express my thoughts on life and my philosophical understanding of existence, prompted by the fact that dogmatic ideology, be it simplistic abrahamic, hindu, or other religious fundamentalism, or your own evangelistic atheism and its fearful denial of anything spiritual.\n \n \n\n While they are disgusted by the idea that we share ancestry with the other apes, you are disgusted by the idea that we are not qualitatively different from other matter. \n\n \n **\n I am disgusted by the ideologically driven stupidity of that notion, just as I am disgusted by the ideologically driven stupidity of \"The Rapture\", or bringing freedom and justice to the wotld by invasion, occupation, and 'regime change'. Stupidity and ignorance arising out of false dogma, resulting in the destructive behaviours that are killing our world, do seem to put me off my feed. That much I admit. Materialism/mechanism/positivism, and its attendant darwinism, is one of those poisonous dogma, and so is religious fundamentalism. The difference being that nobody tries to promote the idea that religious fundamentalism is rational and 'scientific', the way you guys push the notion that your darwinism is real science founded in fact and the scientific method, or that your evangelistic atheism is merely 'secularism', when it is no more 'secular' than acting as a pope in matters of church doctrine.\n \n \n\n And just as it does not appease creationists to observe how far we have elevated ourselves, so it does not appease you to be told 'Yes, we're just matter and physical forces - but aren't they amazing?'\n\n \n **\n You spin my scepticism re your materialist postulate that \"'Yes, we're just matter and physical forces\" as being 'unappeased' , but the true expression is, 'dissatisfied and unconvinced'. \n \n \n\n Before we go any further, I really would like to see you retract the erroneous statement you made earlier:\n \n \n Quote:\n One more question (two i realise). Has it been shown that genes control/decide behaviour?\n \n **\n Darwinist's are forced by their metaphysic and its inherent determinism, in this case 'genetic determinism' to assert that that is the case. \n \n \n I quickly and clearly showed this to be false (even in a fully deterministic universe, genes are not the only input and therefore can only be one influential factor), but so far you have not retracted the statement or admitted your error. If you wouldn't mind...\n\n \n **\n My statement is still true and I have no reason to retract it. It makes no difference that other factors also affect behaviour, (even something so simple as a sudden downpour of rain), so long as it is a fact that darwinists still claim, [and they do. Google any science news and see all the , 'scientists find the gene for' articles, or read up on Behaviourism's grandchild, Evolutionary Psychology] that chemicals, genes, are what determine bioforms and their behaviours. In this very forum any suggestion that epigenetic mechanisms are also in play are always greeted by hoots of 'epigenetic mechanisms are determined by genes'.

The whole multi-paragraph spiel I've excised from this part of your post boils down to \"Everyone except stupid people knows the difference between alive and dead, it's just common sense; why are you asking me for a definition?\" Well, if it's so simple, why are you having such a lot of trouble coming up with a non-circular definition that doesn't rely on your preconceptions? More worryingly for someone touting an allegedly scientific hypothesis, why don't you think you need to?\n \n \nNo, it does not. It merely makes it redundant, because it says the same thing twice. You have these words in quotes, meaning that I actually mispoke myself this way. But so far as I can tell, this is what I actually said--\n \n \"In truth, I defined the difference between 'live' and 'dead' on the basis of empirically observed presence or absence of certain internal systemic activities which are found only within live systems, and nowhere else.\"\n\n \n Ok, let's use your exact quote, replacing 'live' and 'dead' with words of which we have no intuitive appreciate of the meaning:\n \n \"In truth, I defined the difference between 'spling' and 'non-spling' on the basis of empirically observed presence or absence of certain internal systemic activities which are found only within spling systems, and nowhere else.\"\n \n See? Doesn't work does it? Could mean anything.\n \n \nI believe I did, but not, so far as I can discover, in this thread. I would be grateful is you would direct me to the exact post in this or another thread where I used the analogy of \"a physical key to a psychical lock\", so that I can see just exactly what I did say. The first mention of it in this thread that I can find is an allusion you make to it in your post #51.\n\n \n In fairness you did not use the word 'lock', but described physical keys twelve times, so I thought the analogy a reasonable one.\n \n \nnor for saying that that that 'key' \"unlocks something\", implying that the material 'bits' that make up the key are what get the job done, while ignoring the fact that it is not the physical substance out of which a key is made so much as its abstract design, or 'cut', that determines whether or not it 'unlocks' anything.\n\n \n WW, you're doing that other thing again: projecting your strawman vision of my philosophy onto my words. Does my front door key unlock my house because of the material it's made out of, or because of its shape? Do you think I'm somehow unclear about how a key works? Have I not, for the last umpteen pages of umpteen threads, been saying that it is configuration that modulates the behaviour of otherwise identical matter under the physical forces? Why you no risten?\n \n \nBecause I made and make no such assertion of mechanical/physical causation, and your word, 'unlocks', in context, implies, 'unleashes', 'generates', [as, for example, in an atomic explosion],\n\n \n 'Unleash' is not a synonym for 'generate' either. You made a mistake, WW, plain and simple; stop squirming and just say 'sorry, I was a bit quick to assign an opinion to you that you never actually expressed.' \n \n That aside, you still haven't addressed the meat of this sub-issue. I suggested that the operation of the key was mechanical - which I now realise was poor word choice. Sorry (see, it's not hard). What I was trying to establish is whether the function of the physical 'key' - be it passively receptive to the ministrations of vitality, whatever - whether the operation of vitality on that 'key' is inevitable given a correctly configured 'key'. If so, then this does not square with your assertion that life cannot be restored or instilled. If not, then how would vitality 'know' which keys are authentic and which are merely exact physical counterfeits? And how could vitality ever first operate on matter in that case?\n \n \nIn sum, my position is that Vitality is what caused the first configurations of material bits through which it was partially able to 'act' in the universe,\n \n \n Logically impossible. How can vitality cause something that allows it to first act?\n \n **\n You are assuming that Vitality does not act until matter allows it to.\n\n \n No, WW, I'm just reading what you wrote. \"Through which it was partially able to 'act' in the universe\". Able, as in enabled, as in allowed.\n \n \nBut it is causation, \"the causal chain\", that is the entire point of this debate!!\n\n \n Well, it's certainly important. That's why I was taking great pains to try to describe your hypothesis in terms as favourable to vitality being the origin of causality as possible. Sheesh, I won't bother next time!\n \n \nI would say that Vitality operates upon particulate matter at all times, but only under certain circumstances, as per the robust anthropic principle, does it successfully enable systematized configurations of matter to access it and through them extend its self-expression.\n\n \n Well that's extremely interesting. Extremely interesting. So now dead things aren't incapable of accessing vitality, they just can't access it very well. Which further undermines your assertion that life cannot be restored - since it never fully departs, the point is moot.\n \n \nYou are assuming that Vitality does not act until matter allows it to. Until matter 'unleashes' vitality. But Vitality pre-exists matter, just as the other forces do.\n\n \n Doesn't matter (cough). The lion can be in the cage since before I was born - since the dawn of time - but if it can't get out unless I unlock the door...\n \n \nThe first lifeforms configured/designed or caused by vitality further enable its expression; they do not generate it, or originate its expression. They simply help increase and expand it. There is no logical 'catch-22' in this.\n\n \n Er, yes, actually, there is. You're inventing a special case, an exception to your rule that states the physical key defines what can be accessed - and your only rationale is that it 'must have happened that way' because otherwise your philosophical principles might have to be compromised.\n \n Surely a more logical and consistent explanation is to say that, while you maintain that the evolution of modern life forms is impossible without vitality, the chance formation of the first and simplest key is within the bounds of possibility given the sheer amount of matter there is in the universe.\n \n \nAnd I have no idea where you dreamed up the notion that I ever denied, let alone, \"went ballistic\" the fact [no \"notion\" there] that \"differential reproductive rates\" result in (I'm not sure in what sense, \"cause\"), \"a change in the distribution of genes in a population\" [which is your 'definition' of evolution itself, g*d help us!].\n\n \n Sorry; must have been thinking of something else. Possibly my memory has been corroded by the sheer quantity of vitriol that spews from your fingers whenever the subject is brought up.\n \n But ok, since you've been good enough to concede that differential reproductive rates do result in altered distribution of alleles in a population, let's see if I can eke another inch of slack out of you.\n \n Assume we have a population of 100 bacteria, one of them with a beneficial mutation. Further assume that we remove DRR from the equation by manually imposing a 'one organism, one offspring' rule. Now, imagine there's another potential mutation that would confer additional benefits. So we stew this colony for a while, and let all the little bacteria randomly accrue mutations (or as EAM would have it, busily try to figure out an adaptive mutation). Eventually one 'succeeds'.\n \n What are the odds that the one which succeeds is also the one descended from the possessor of the first adaptive mutation? Answer: 1 in 100. The beneficial mutations are very unlikely to stack.\n \n Repeat the experiment, providing just enough resources to supply 100 bacteria, but allowing the competitive benefit conferred by the first mutation to effect DRR.\n \n Are the odds of the second mutation stacking with the first higher or lower than 1 in 100?\n \n \nBeing a materialist/mechanist, and therefore a determinist, you would consider the question of \"inevitability\", of primary importance. I do not.\n\n \n But it speaks directly to your assertion that life cannot be restored or instilled! You can't just say 'I don't really care' and then go off making hard statements that depend absolutely on the unresolved issue!\n \n \nI'd say the odds were very good. But not inevitable, because determinism destroys freedom, which destroys creativity, which defeats the the entire purpose of the exercise.\n\n \n Wow. The 'purpose of the exercise'? Am I missing something, or did you just flat out admit that your whole purpose in constructing the hypothesis of EAM is to reach a predetermined conclusion?\n \n \nYou are assuming that the simple configurations that enabled the first organisms to express the facets of vitality that define 'life' were not necessary just as they were, and that we can do what vitality did, and that the complex configurations (developed over billions of generations of vitality-driven evolution) which exist today, would serve that purpose equally well. Sort of like trying to chop down a tree with a broken chainsaw. Vitality can no more 'jump-start' a dead organism than a jolt of electricity can put life back in a dead frog, or a dead cell.\n\n \n Ah, right, so back in the day, matter could assume configurations that allowed Vitality to act through it. Or rather, in a feat of logical impossibility, Vitality could shape matter into configurations that would allow it to act. But not any more. \n \n \nYou further suppose that the particular physical environment that allowed vitality to shape those first systems is also unnecessary to the task of re-starting the creation of simple life forms today.\n \n I submit that your assumptions are ill-founded.\n\n \n And I submit that these plugs for all the holes in your hypothesis are just being made up on the spot. So now both matter, and the physical environment 'must have been' different, that difference 'allowing' vitality to work - without, of course, for a moment suggesting that matter was not wholly subservient to vitality...\n \n Hmmmmm....\n \n \n \nBut complex behaviours, like those of live organisms and pocket watches, do automatically require us to look beyond the 4 physical forces to explain them, because, quite frankly, the 4 physical forces cannot and do not explain them. \n\n \n But pocket watches do operate according to the physical forces, and nothing more.\n \n \nThat was Paley's point, and it still stands.\n\n \n Actually, no it wasn't. His point related to the requirement for a creator, a designer, not the ongoing presence of an additional force. Paley's god could have died long ago, and his arguments would apply equally. Equally badly, mind you. \n \n \nAll of this is pure red-herring. It has no bearing on the issues involved here.\n\n \n Really? In what way is the analogy not apt? In what way does it not mirror your analysis of a mechanism beyond your immediate comprehension?\n \n \nI'm sorry, but just where exactly do you see me \"reach for the supernatural\"? Your problem is that your metaphysic demands that you define anything that is not demonstrably physical and mechanical as \"supernatural\".\n\n \n Perhaps because otherwise natural and supernatural are without meaning?\n \n \nJust because a concept like Vitality dwarfs your materialist/mechanist understanding, that is no justification for labeling it, 'supernatural'.\n\n \n Then Archangel and Supersport's \"god did it\" is natural too, as is the flying spaghetti monster, both of which are hypotheses that can be made to fit the facts by appealing to forces beyond the physical. Once you discard the requirement of testability, anything goes.\n \n \nWhy not? Why shouldn't they. Even though I have been speaking of a natural force, and not some \"departed spirit\", as you would like to spin it, the present facts we have point in that direction,\n\n \n No, they don't, any more than the caveman's inability to fix a broken watch would be indicative that the task was impossible.\n \n \nHey, unless and until you can show, logically and/or empitically, that your assertion that the 4 physical forces, despite a ton of prima facie evidence to the contrary, are perfectly sufficient to the generation of live organisms, then it is you people who are talking irrationally, not me.\n\n \n We don't have any evidence to contradict the hypothesis that life operates via the physical forces. What evidence are you talking about? Your 'common sense' knowledge that living organisms are 'just different'? \n \n \nNo matter what you \"suspect\", my motives in all this are to express my thoughts on life and my philosophical understanding of existence, \n\n \n Well, that's fine, but starting from a philosophy and constructing a hypothesis to explain its disparity with reality is the essence of religion, not science. \n \n \nMy statement is still true and I have no reason to retract it. It makes no difference that other factors also affect behaviour, (even something so simple as a sudden downpour of rain), so long as it is a fact that darwinists still claim, [and they do. Google any science news and see all the , 'scientists find the gene for' articles, or read up on Behaviourism's grandchild, Evolutionary Psychology] that chemicals, genes, are what determine bioforms and their behaviours. In this very forum any suggestion that epigenetic mechanisms are also in play are always greeted by hoots of 'epigenetic mechanisms are determined by genes'. You guys need to get your stories straight.\n\n \n I'm disappointed, WW, that you do not realise the value of a graceful apology when one is merited. You made a statement that is factually and logically incorrect. Genetic traits and epigenetic mechanisms are not behaviours, and it was concerning behaviours you made your statement. According to you, my doctrine forces me to assert that I like sugar in my tea because my genes dictate that it be so. This is pure, ripe bull-pudding.",

   "\n \n You're doing it again. You're just not seeing it because you're using words you already know the meaning of, independent of the definition you're proposing to create.\n \n Look, if I say to you \"I define a SPLING to be a geometric shape such that its perimeter has constant curvature\", then you can go out and partition the world of geometric shapes into SPLINGS and non-SPLINGS. However, if I say to you, \"I define a SPLING to be a shape such that it possesses all those geometric properties that are found in SPLINGs but in no other geometric shapes\", what can you do with that? You have no preconception about what a 'spling' is; you can't recognise one, and more to the point I haven't defined it for you.\n \n The only reason you think your equally circular (pun intended) and useless definition is ok is that you already have a preconception of what a 'circle' is, and what 'alive' is. Now do you see the problem?\n\n \n **\n Yes, I do. You keep on insisting on a hard and fast technical/mechanical definition of 'life', and I mistakenly used the word 'definition' to describe the method of discrimination that one would use in order to create a distinction between 'live' and 'not-living', since I understood from you that that was my task--to demonstrate that there really was a distinct difference/division/dividing line/separation point between 'life' and 'not-life'. That, after all, was the point at issue at the time. [You will recall that I pointed out that quantum mechanics had shown that there are no seemless and indivisible continuums, as per materialism, neither in time, space, or anything else, but that everything that is, is sub-divided into quantum bits, a progression of points, and not an unbroken line, and so a clean division arises anywhere between any two points.]\n \n You seized on my use of the word 'definition' in this context, which was probably a poor choice on my part, since I was talking about _how to go about_ mechanically 'defining', i.e., establishing the parameters, that separate/divide/distinguish life from non-life, but not actually providing the mechano-chemical definition you are apparently asking for, since my long-standing definition of live organisms as autopoietic systems was apparently insufficient to satisfy your demands.\n I used the word 'definition' because I thought it applicable in context, but you have insisted that 'definition' does not mean 'definition' in the sense of general boundaries, but only in the sense of specified particulars, and you are right, if a technical mechanical definition is the only thing that qualifies as a definition. Instructions on how to establish such a definition are not that definition. But, since I am not a cellular biologist, I have no idea what internal operations, specifically, are found in a live cell or other lifeforms that distinguish them from the not-living parts of the universe, including non-autopoietic systems. I can only use general terms, like 'metabolism', and whatnot.\n If you want show that metabolic processes in live cells are exactly the same as what goes on in, say, a bowl of soup, you'll have to bring in the technical chemical details yourself. I say they are not the same, but not being a chemist or a biologist, I cannot give you the specific chemical details of how their internal activities differ from one another. And since you insist that nothing less will satisfy you, that without those details there is no 'definition', then I guess this particular issue has come to a dead end.\n \n Since the rest of your post is just more beating this dead horse, laced with vituperation, I can't be bothered with it.\n \n I suggest that we clarify just exactly what the issues we are debating are, because I am no longer sure I understand just what it is that you are trying to establish here.

They just aren't [b]as smart[b] as a colony. A colony is able to make more complex decisions than individuals. This is the type of intelligence I see as driving Endogenous Adaptive Mutagenesis. Individual cells are capable of making very limited choices, but all the cells of an organism are together able to make more complex decisions about the welfare of the organism.\n \n \nHow else could ants organize highways, build elaborate nests, stage epic raids, and do all the other things ants do?\n \n \n Bertvan: Of course materialists will argue that such behavior is stored in the brains of each individual ant and bee. (Which was somehow placed in the brain by a DNA sequence). However materialists have not even speculated about the physical nature of such storage. Nor have they speculated about how a DNA sequence might translate into a behavior.\n \n \n\"Ants aren't smart,\" Gordon says. \"Ant colonies are.\" A colony can solve problems unthinkable for individual ants, such as finding the shortest path to the best food source, allocating workers to different tasks, or defending a territory from neighbors. As individuals, ants might be tiny dummies, but as colonies they respond quickly and effectively to their environment. They do it with something called swarm intelligence. \n \n Where this intelligence comes from raises a fundamental question in nature: How do the simple actions of individuals add up to the complex behavior of a group? How do hundreds of honeybees make a critical decision about their hive if many of them disagree? What enables a school of herring to coordinate its movements so precisely it can change direction in a flash, like a single, silvery organism? The collective abilities of such animals-none of which grasps the big picture, but each of which contributes to the group's success-seem miraculous even to the biologists who know them best. \n \n . . .So nobody's deciding whether it's a good day to forage. The collective is, but no particular ant is.\" \n\n \n Bertvan: Endogenous Adaptive Mutagenesis does not question evolution. EAM questions that evolution is driven by \"random mutation and natural selection\". I interpret EAM as a collective intelligence innate to living systems interacts with the environment and organizes limited adaptations. Such adaptations do not originate as accidents in DNA sequences, and while natural selection may affect their distribution, natural selection plays no role in their original organization. The genome is merely one of the resources the organism uses to explore new adaptations. All adaptations are limited, but most living systems are capable of some change in response to challenges. Used organs develop and unused organs atrophy. Such adaptations are inherited epigenetically, as they develop, and only become a permanent aspect of the genome if persistent over many generations.\n \n If religious people see some role for their deity in this process, no one can deny that possibility. However if intelligence of any form, including swarm intelligence, is involved, life is intelligently designed.",

A colony is able to make more complex decisions than individuals. \n\n \n Once more this is an emergent property of multiple agents following relatively primitive rules. Its not EAM as envisioned.\n \n \nThis is the type of intelligence I see as driving Endogenous Adaptive Mutagenesis. Individual cells are capable of making very limited choices, but all the cells of an organism are together able to make more complex decisions about the welfare of the organism.\n\n \n The cells do not \"make decisions\" they simply follow the program and the complex interactions lead to the observed complex behaviors. Surely you do not think that your neurons individually possess intelligence. My goodness what a mess that would make of our thought processesemoticon_smile \n \n \nBertvan: Of course materialists will argue that such behavior is stored in the brains of each individual ant and bee. (Which was somehow placed in the brain by a DNA sequence). However materialists have not even speculated about the physical nature of such storage. Nor have they speculated about how a DNA sequence might translate into a behavior.\n\n \n You are a bit behind. Memory and nerve networks have been studied rather deeply. Its the interconnections you realize with individual nerve actions being determined ultimately by the physiological mechanisms present (and of course the physiological status) in the neurons. An individual neuron is effectively a little biological logic gate (or sensor) which executes a specific logical operation on its inputs and reflects the outcome of the operation in its outputs. Hook such logic gates together in various ways and you get a simple fixed behavior to the same inputs much like your garage door switch (if the door is up it goes down, if its down it goes up, if there is a blockage or binding it stops, if pushed during motion the door may stop or finish its cycle depending on the wiring) up to and including your PC or even your brain. Again none of that is EAM.\n \n \n \nBertvan: Endogenous Adaptive Mutagenesis does not question evolution. EAM questions that evolution is driven by \"random mutation and natural selection\". I interpret EAM as a collective intelligence innate to living systems interacts with the environment and organizes limited adaptations. Such adaptations do not originate as accidents in DNA sequences, and while natural selection may affect their distribution, natural selection plays no role in their original organization. The genome is merely one of the resources the organism uses to explore new adaptations. All adaptations are limited, but most living systems are capable of some change in response to challenges. Used organs develop and unused organs atrophy. Such adaptations are inherited epigenetically, as they develop, and only become a permanent aspect of the genome if persistent over many generations.\n\n \n Well you will have to consult THE MAN (or the Lagomorph) on your understanding of EAM. What you describe is quite different from how I understand Wabbitism to work. I believe he postulates some force he calls vitalism which itself organizes matter in such a way that \"vitality\" can flow through the matter and animate it. And that somehow this flow of vitalism allows the organism to not only examine its environment but to make intelligent directed responses to that environment which are in turn heritable. Or perhaps I am mixing WW and SS into a hybrid - I have a hard time telling them apart sometimes. Like I said ask the man himself - its his personal theory after all and he should know. To me it sounds an awful lot like open system thermodynamics but HE says otherwise.\n \n \nIf religious people see some role for their deity in this process, no one can deny that possibility. However if intelligence of any form, including swarm intelligence, is involved, life is intelligently designed.\n\n \n Of course not but to admit that possibility negates a core principle of science - namely that materialst explanations only are to be admitted. That materialist explanations are adequate to explain materialist results.",

   "[QUOTE]Bertvan: I do not call \"intelligence\" emergent. Where would it \"emerge\" from? Emergence sounds miraculous to me. I see intelligence as an intrinsic aspect of all reality, but only discernable in living systems (except perhaps at the quantum level). [/Auote]\n \n Everybody is entitled to their opinion. Is it your view that the \"intelligence\" of a cell is due to the interactions of the intelligences of the individual atoms of which it is composed? And the intelligence of the individual atoms is the interaction of the intelligence of the subatomic particles of which it is composed, and that the intelligence of those particles is the interaction of the probability waves, strings, or whatever of which they are composed? If so then intelligence is in your terms also an emergent property.\n \n \nWhether or not living systems make choices Is a judgment made by observing the behavior of such systems.\n\n \n I will agree that some living systems make choices. But do you honestly believe that a bacterium which swims toward a light source made a choice? Especially if I tell you that all such bacteria will always swim toward that light source? Always mind you!\n \n \nDo they seem automatic and uniform? Can they adjust to unforeseeable circumstances? Do they demonstrate a creativity not easily accounted for by accident? Are their choices fallible? (true choice cannot exist without the option of being wrong) .\n\n \n Yes they do seem automatic and uniform in many cases. Ask your doctor about the pateller reflex loop sometime! As to your questions after that:\n No, No, Yes, \n \n I\n don't care if you call it intelligence, vitalism or something else. The system is either deterministic or it is not. If it is deterministic, something designs the \"program\" that determines the so-called automatic decisions. So far \"random mutation and natural selection\" is the only materialistic designer anyone has suggested.. And if living systems are not deterministic, something makes decisions. Call it intelligence, vitalism, \"god\", or whatever.\n\n \n Ah I can see that you do not understand that systems which are completely deterministic are capable of producing behavior which is flexible and even apparently random or fallibly selective. Lets take the simple example of the little program in your computer which generates random numbers. Its just computer code, it is fully deterministic or else your computer is working improperly. Yet it can produce what to all intents and purposes are random numbers so from the outside of the box so to speak it appears to be non-deterministic. The error you make here is to think that you understand the limits of behavior for deterministic systems when nobody really does know what those limits might be. You observe \"choice\" externally without knowing how or by what mechanisms that choice was reached and conclude that the underlying mechanism must be non-deterministic - the question is how you know that (or rather CAN you know that?). In other words there are no sound grounds to conclude that choice is not fully deterministic in its detailed mechanisms. And of course your ability to distinguish deterministic from non-deterministic mechanisms is the core and key to your argument. I would say that its not possible to make that distinction without detailed knowledge of the underlying mechanisms.\n \n \n \nBertvan: And that \"program\" just miraculously popped into existence? I certainly do believe cells make decisions. Granted such decisions are limited. Just as the decisions made by individual bees and ants are limited. Yet as a swarm they are able to make decisions in the best interest of the swarm. I would consider a system [b]without]/b] the ability to improvise a mess. It would crash at the first appearance of novel conditions. (by novel I mean conditions not foreseeable by the programmer.)\n\n \n Nope nobody ever need invoke a miracle, such is greatly frowned upon in science. The deterministic behavior of cells has evolved, those which responded more appropriately to their environement survived. Whats left of course are cells suited to their environment to a greater degree. As to the dynamics of swarms their behaviors are often emergent from the independt actions of multiple agents following simple rules. The rule of course can be hardwired in via evolutionary processes and need not be the result of intelligence. Consider the flocking behaviors of boids!\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids\n \n Be sure to visit some of the links and run the graphics simulations. Afterwards ask yourself if the behaviors are due to choice (realizing of course that they cannot be) and whether the system you are observing is deterministic or otherwise (it has to be deterministic).\n \n \nBertvan: If science does not allow non materialist explanations (ones that include the possibility of purposeful, free choice), and free will and intelligence are a real, non supernatural aspect of reality, then science is merely an irrelevant game. If you find materialist explanations adequate to explain reality, I have no desire to disturb your complicacy. Some people are not so easily satisfied.\n\n \n Why do you think that materialist mechanisms cannot lead to what you observe as choice or even what you observe and precieve as purpose - even your own choice and purpose? Why do you think that what we call intelligence is necessarily non-material or non-determinstic in its mechanisms? Do you know of any non-material intelligences? Do you think your brain is somehow not operating according to natural law? Can you point to any thing your mind does which is non-deterministic in its mechansims with evidence of course not just opinion? What would that be? I certainly have never come across any such - have you?\n \n And what do you think science would be like if it admitted immaterial explanations of some sort? Of what use would say a theory of mechanics be if it incorporated immaterial components?",

   "We should be able to test fairly easily whether adaptations seen during character displacement are due to natural selection or EAM-type volitional adaptation. \n \n In EAM, the organisms perceive a problem and adjust to it. In selection theory, individuals cannot adjust themselves genetically, so whenever selection is dominant (whether or not the organisms perceive a problem and even if they modify their behavior or their physiology), they and their genes will primarily thrive or wane according to the genetic hand they were dealt at birth. \n \n When two fairly simlar populations or species physically overlap, the principle of competition requires/predicts that the individuals / lineages that are closest in traits to the other population will experience additional competition and cannot survive together indefinitely. The problem will get resolved in one of three ways: 1) if the ecosystem doesn't permit two variant phenotypes to flourish, then one of the two populations will go extinct, or 2) (if the two species are very closely related) they may hybridize back to the original form, or 3) if two slightly different specialists can be supported, then they will evolve to be even more different. \n \n So we could find some animals, say fish in lakes, that show recent competitive displacement, and we can test them. The two species should show the most differences in specimens from lakes where the two species live together, whereas less difference should be seen between the species when comparing specimens from various lakes where only one of the species lives. The different specializations should involve tradeoffs, and the trade-offs should be demonstrable in terms of differences in fitness. \n \n Lo and behold, Dolph Schluter has done this, as described in a book and a series of articles. I'm going to discuss \"Adaptive Radiation in Sticklebacks: Trade-Offs in Feeding Performance and Growth,\" in Ecology, 76(1: Jan. 1995):82-90. He has two species of sticklebacks that are inferred to have separated very recently and which are overall quite similar. In lakes where they co-occur, one species has become a bit bigger, and has a larger mouth, a deeper body, and fewer shorter gill rakers than the other species, while the other one is the opposite. The bigger species specializes in benthic near-shore zones (feeding off the bottom and in and around vegetation), whereas the smaller one specializes in open-water offshore zones. In lakes where only one of the species exists, whichever species is present looks more like an average of the two species. These fish are more generalized and spend time in both habitats. So there is an exaggerated difference in zones of overlap.\n \n He tested the fitness of the specializations and the trade-offs involved in specialization by transplanting stocks to the two habitats in new lakes. He used 36 exposures (18 in each habitat), and he repeated the experiment in a second year. In shallow inshore zones, the open-water species grew only half as fast as the littoral species. In offshore openwater habitats, the benthic nearshore species grew only half as fast as the offshore open-water species. So the individual fish did not adapt themselves (contrary to EAM's expectations), but thrived or failed according to their genes.\n \n To test how the specialists did against \"average individuals\" he also bred some hybrids (the hybrids were viable and fully fertile) and tested them against the specialists in the enclosed habitats as well. In all the enclosures, the hybrids tended to do a bit worse than the specialist in its own habitat, but better than the specialist in the wrong habitat. (This result was a little less clear-cut than the comarisons of the specialists, however). \n \n So there you have it: success does not result from individuals adapting themselves, but simply from individuals flourishing or flailing, and therefore their lineages getting rewarded or culled, according to the characteristics that they bring to the table. \n \n This should, in fact, surprise no one. Life is fecund, quickly generating vastly more individuals than will ever get to survive and reproduce. Every species inevitably shows a lot of variability, sometimes huge amounts (think of the variations you can see in a huge crowd of people). Although a lot of individual success is simply a matter of luck, observation shows that very often one set of variations will give their owners an edge under certain conditions, as we see here with the sticklebacks, where slight differences can mean differences by a factor of two in their growth rates.",

   "OK B&W coming up - lets start with WIKI because it gives a concise definition.\n and reference B&W 1956.\n \n \nCharacter displacement\n From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n Jump to: navigation, search\n \n Character displacement refers to the phenomenon where differences among similar species whose distributions overlap geographically are accentuated in regions where the species co-occur but are minimized or lost where the species' distributions do not overlap. This pattern results from evolutionary change driven by competition among species for a limited resource (e.g. food). The rationale for character displacement stems from the competitive exclusion principle, also called Gause's Law, which contends that to coexist in a stable environment two competing species must differ in their respective ecological niche; without differentiation, one species will eliminate or exclude the other through competition.\n \n Character displacement was first explicitly explained by Brown and Wilson (1956): \"Two closely related species have overlapping ranges. In the parts of the ranges where one species occurs alone, the populations of that species are similar to the other species and may even be very difficult to distinguish from it. In the area of overlap, where the two species occur together, the populations are more divergent and easily distinguished, i.e., they \"displace\" one another in one or more characters. The characters involved can be morphological, ecological, behavioral, or physiological; they are assumed to be genetically based.\"\n \n Brown and Wilson (1956) used the term character displacement to refer to instances of both reproductive character displacement, or reinforcement of reproductive barriers, and ecological character displacement driven by competition. As the term character displacement is commonly used, it generally refers to morphological differences due to competition. Brown and Wilson viewed character displacement as phenomenon involved in speciation, stating, \"we believe that it is a common aspect of geographical speciation, arising most often as a product of the genetic and ecological interaction of two (or more) newly evolved, cognate species [derived from the same immediate parental species] during their period of first contact\" (1956). While character displacement is important in various scenarios of speciation, including adaptive radiations like the cichlid fish faunas in the rift lakes of East Africa (Meyer 1993), it also plays an important role in structuring communities. The results of numerous studies contribute evidence that character displacement often influences the evolution of resource acquisition among members of an ecological guild (Dayan and Simberloff 2005).\n \n Competitive release (Grant 1972), defined as the expansion of an ecological niche in the absence of a competitor, is essentially the mirror image of character displacement. It too was described by Brown and Wilson (1956): \"Two closely related species are distinct where they occur together, but where one member of the pair occurs alone it converges toward the second, even to the extent of being nearly identical with it in some characters.\"\n\n \n You can get the first page of the article at JSTOR - and buy the article if you wish.\n \n http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0039-7989%28195606%295%3A2%3C49%3ACD%3E2.0.CO%3B2-T&size=LARGE&origin=JSTOR-enlargePage\n \n OK the term \"predict\" is not applicable. What the authors did (and one of them is THE Wilson ie E.O. Wilson by the way) was to put the concept on a good formal foundation.",

   "True. Evolution does not, but darwinism does. And I did say darwinism and its, \"Natural Selection\", which you have falsely changed to 'evolution'. Lies and misdirections, oh my!\n\n Eat crow, Mike, here's your exact words: \n the trivial tautological truism that 'evolution = the survival of the 'fittest' \n \n \n You cited http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwinism (so all of a sudden you like Wikipedia?) Well, let's see what it says - \nDarwinism is a term for the underlying theory in those ideas of Charles Darwin concerning evolution and natural selection. Discussions of Darwinism usually focus on evolution by natural selection,\n That's my point, right there.\n \n It's true that it continues \"but sometimes Darwinism is taken to mean evolution more broadly\", but as it notes, \"The term Darwinism is often used by promotors of creationism to describe evolution, notably by leading members of the intelligent design movement.[1] In this usage, the term has connotations of atheism.\" \n \n I'm objecting to usages that, like yours, parallel the creationist usage. You are continually accusing all of us of being \"darwinists\" which you equate with RM&NS, when Darwin knew nothing about mutation. \n \n Wikipedia continues by exactly bolstering my complaint against your usage: \n \n used neutrally within the scientific community to distinguish modern evolutionary theories from those first proposed by Darwin [it means that the other way around], as well as by historians to differentiate it from other evolutionary theories from around the same period. For example, Darwinism may be used to refer to Darwin's proposed mechanism of natural selection, in comparison to more recent theories such as genetic drift and gene flow. \n Precisely - no one on this board is a strict Darwinist. You are, simply, wrong here.\n \n \n \nThere is no 'ginning up' of observed facts and rational inferences derived from those facts. One fact being that probability places such a development way out of bounds for random chance and its darwinian selectionism.\n Random recombination and darwinian selection (yeah! you used it corectly for once) are all that's needed to get character displacement underway. No new mutations are necessary, although of course they can be incorporated.\n \n \n It is a tautology under any commonly accepted [dictionary] meaning of the word, 'tautologous'. That you darwinists exercise your usual 'special pleading' wrt your peculiar self-serving humpty dumpty semantics is simply to be scoffed at.\n No. Evolution (narrowly) is change in gene frequency from one generation to the next. More broadly, it's (semi)permanent change in phenotype due to genomic change over time. The genetic change is caused by differential reproductive success, which can be measured directly and objectively in the lab and in the field. Changes in phenotype do not HAVE to be caused by changes in the genome, and changes in the genome do not have to be caused by differential reproductive success - it could potentially all be epigenetics or EAM, except that the evidence rules otherwise. \n \n \n It is not a \"prediction\" when you simply describe what you have already observed. Or are you trying to convince us all that this idea simply popped into their heads one day, generated spontaneously by the magic of Natural Selection? After which epiphany they ran out into the bush to see if they were right? Hogwash. \n\n You are right in what you say about predictions, but you are misreading what I said. \n \n(From me) Brown and Wilson, 1956, predicted that character displacement should occur by competitive exclusion whenever two closely similar competitors overlap, and the opposite effect (competitive release) should be seen where they don't overlap.\n\n \n From the beginning and end of B&W: \n \"we believe that it is a common aspect of geographical speciation, arising most often as a product of the genetic and ecological interaction of two (or more) newly evolved, cognate species [derived from the same immediate parental species] during their period of first contact\"\n \n and \n \n \"It is clear that, in the case where the species are closely related, sympatric species will tend to be more different from one another than allopatric ones.\"\n\n Those constitute predictions that character displacement should occur by competitive exclusion whenever two closely similar competitors overlap. By competitive exclusion whenever they overlap. Such as in the instances under discussion. \n \n \n [bunch of absolutely priceless stuff not worth responding to] \n \n \nNonsense. Utter horse manure. You cannot \"factor out\" luck when a/inheritance is based on lucky [or unlucky] chance genetic mutations. That alone makes anything and everything that ensues from that beginning, a matter of pure chance. But then you get b/, the notion that inheritance is made directional and mechanical and predictable by random chance events acting positively or negatively, as the case may be, on the fortunes of genetic inheritance!! The whole silly, stupid, pseudo-scientific just-so story is nothing but an appeal to luck, chance, random accident, coincidence, and every other non-scientific concept you can come up with. In the end, your darwinism is nothing but your superstition dressed up in a stolen lab coat. \n\n You are refuted by countless experiments like Schluter's, from my subsequent post. He exactly and precisely factored out luck. The growth rates he measured were entirely due to the genetically determined capabilities of the two groups.\n \n \n \nTrue, and that's called adaptation, the principle of adaptationism, the responsive, dynamic, intrinsic organismic mechanism for evolution contained in EAM, but which is an evolutionary principle that forms no part of darwinian 'selectionism', and is in fact anti thetical to the darwinian notion that evolution is based upon random chance genetic variables coincidentally and fortuitously corresponding, when expressed, with random chance environmental factors,-- as I explained earlier.\n\n I'll grant that you are logically consistent and non-darwinian, but too bad for you that reality doesn't appear to happen the way that you want it too.

   "Patently false. See above.\n\n \n Sorry but Wells is correct here and you are mistaken. Its by definition!\n \n \nGenetic drift\n From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n In population genetics, genetic drift is the statistical effect that results from the influence that chance has on the survival of alleles (variants of a gene). The effect may cause an allele and the biological trait that it confers to become more common or more rare over successive generations. Ultimately, the drift may either remove the allele from the gene pool or remove all other alleles. Whereas natural selection is the tendency of beneficial alleles to become more common over time (and detrimental ones less common), genetic drift is the fundamental tendency of any allele to vary randomly in frequency over time due to statistical variation alone, so long as it does not comprise all or none of the distribution.\n",

   "We should be able to test fairly easily whether adaptations seen during character displacement are due to natural selection or EAM-type volitional adaptation. \n \n In EAM, the organisms perceive a problem and adjust to it. In selection theory, individuals cannot adjust themselves genetically, so whenever selection is dominant (whether or not the organisms perceive a problem and even if they modify their behavior or their physiology), they and their genes will primarily thrive or wane according to the genetic hand they were dealt at birth. \n \n When two fairly simlar populations or species physically overlap, the principle of competition requires/predicts that the individuals / lineages that are closest in traits to the other population will experience additional competition and cannot survive together indefinitely. The problem will get resolved in one of three ways: 1) if the ecosystem doesn't permit two variant phenotypes to flourish, then one of the two populations will go extinct, or 2) (if the two species are very closely related) they may hybridize back to the original form, or 3) if two slightly different specialists can be supported, then they will evolve to be even more different. \n \n So we could find some animals, say fish in lakes, that show recent competitive displacement, and we can test them. The two species should show the most differences in specimens from lakes where the two species live together, whereas less difference should be seen between the species when comparing specimens from various lakes where only one of the species lives. The different specializations should involve tradeoffs, and the trade-offs should be demonstrable in terms of differences in fitness. \n\n \n **\n EAM is, of course, in complete agreement with what you've said to this point. And btw, ichthyologists and wildlife biologists didn't wait to have darwinists discover that similar species are the most competitive and the most destructive of one another. This was first noted in the 19th century, in the atlantic provinces and states, when introduced european brown trout were found to be largely responsible for wiping out the native brook trout population. \n \n \n\n Lo and behold, Dolph Schluter has done this, as described in a book and a series of articles. I'm going to discuss \"Adaptive Radiation in Sticklebacks: Trade-Offs in Feeding Performance and Growth,\" in Ecology, 76(1: Jan. 1995):82-90.\n\n \n **\n As above, ol' Dolph should have caught up on his reading. It's old news. Over 100 years old.\n \n \n\n He has two species of sticklebacks that are inferred to have separated very recently and which are overall quite similar. In lakes where they co-occur, one species has become a bit bigger, and has a larger mouth, a deeper body, and fewer shorter gill rakers than the other species, while the other one is the opposite. The bigger species specializes in benthic near-shore zones (feeding off the bottom and in and around vegetation), whereas the smaller one specializes in open-water offshore zones. In lakes where only one of the species exists, whichever species is present looks more like an average of the two species. These fish are more generalized and spend time in both habitats. So there is an exaggerated difference in zones of overlap.\n\n \n \n **\n So far, pure EAM.\n \n \n\n He tested the fitness of the specializations and the trade-offs involved in specialization by transplanting stocks to the two habitats in new lakes. He used 36 exposures (18 in each habitat), and he repeated the experiment in a second year. In shallow inshore zones, the open-water species grew only half as fast as the littoral species. In offshore openwater habitats, the benthic nearshore species grew only half as fast as the offshore open-water species. So the individual fish did not adapt themselves (contrary to EAM's expectations), but thrived or failed according to their genes.\n\n \n **\n Nonsense. Two whole generations, you say? WOW!! And the species that found themselves in habitat that was not the one they were adapted to, grew only half as fast as the species that was in the habitat that it was adapted to? Gee, imagine that?! This example of yours is a weird bit cheese--it's full of holes, runny, and it smells, all at the same time. BTW, what happened to the fish once they finished growing/developing?\n \n \n\n To test how the specialists did against \"average individuals\" he also bred some hybrids (the hybrids were viable and fully fertile) and tested them against the specialists in the enclosed habitats as well. In all the enclosures, the hybrids tended to do a bit worse than the specialist in its own habitat, but better than the specialist in the wrong habitat. (This result was a little less clear-cut than the comarisons of the specialists, however). \n\n \n **\n And this came as some kind of surprise to him and his fellow darwinists? Well, duh!!\n \n \n\n So there you have it: success does not result from individuals adapting themselves, but simply from individuals flourishing or flailing, and therefore their lineages getting rewarded or culled, according to the characteristics that they bring to the table. \n\n \n **\n By your own measure, \"fitness\" defined as differential reproductive success, there is no evidence that in the two whole generations studied that overall, the misplaced species had negative differential reproduction compared to the well-placed species, even though anyone might expect that to be the case. At least, anyone who is an adaptationist, rather than a selectionist. OTH, if the maladapted species reproduced just as well as the adapted species, what's your point?\n \n \n\n This should, in fact, surprise no one.\n\n \n **\n Hey, tell me about it!!\n \n \n\n Life is fecund, quickly generating vastly more individuals than will ever get to survive and reproduce. Every species inevitably shows a lot of variability, sometimes huge amounts (think of the variations you can see in a huge crowd of people).\n\n \n **\n Yeah, and we all know that variation, \"just happens, that's all\", in the darwinist non-explanation. Again, what's your point?!?\n \n \n\n Although a lot of individual success is simply a matter of luck, observation shows that very often one set of variations will give their owners an edge under certain conditions, as we see here with the sticklebacks, where slight differences can mean differences by a factor of two in their growth rates.\n\n \n **\n Do you have no inkling of just how inane, vapid and vacuous this stuff really is?!?",

   "\"Pure EAM ......... Nonsense\" would indeed be about right there.\n \n You missed a point in your haste there - in this particular experiment he was using growth rates, not reproductive rates. He showed in the paper how # of eggs correlates with the size of the female stickleback, so for female fish getting bigger quicker appears to correlate straightforwardly with having more young. \n \n Dolph was fine in his reading. His transplantation experiments were exceptionally good field experiments, using controlled transplants under as natural conditions as possible (real lakes, but fine-mesh-fenced off portions of them), with unusually large numbers of replicates for that sort of experiment.\n \n Nothing is wrong with two generations - how many times do you want a stickleback to grow to adulthood, anyway? Also, multiple years risks different weather patterns / food availability, so he's better off with many replicates in a small number of years than the reverse. He compared his results grouped and per year.\n \n Variation was well documented by Darwin and others, but since then we understand it quite well, thank you. The inheritable portions of the variation turn out to be of great significance, as that can strongly influence success in life, and we have very good explanations of how it gets generated, and why variation seems to be inevitable.

   "\"Pure EAM ......... Nonsense\" would indeed be about right there.\n\n \n \n **\n Ho hum. More yada yada yada.\n \n \n\n You missed a point in your haste there - in this particular experiment he was using growth rates, not reproductive rates.\n\n \n **\n Not only did I not miss this--I explicitly pointed it out to you. Do you never tire of telling lies, neil?\n \n \n\n He showed in the paper how # of eggs correlates with the size of the female stickleback, so for female fish getting bigger quicker appears to correlate straightforwardly with having more young. \n\n \n **\n The 'hen size' to 'egg total' correlation applies to all species, but is only meaningful within a given species. A ten pound carp may lay more eggs than a 6 oz. fathead minnow, but that has nothing to do with comparitive, 'fitness', even by your silly definition of that term. And the same applies here, where again you are trying to make a false 'fitness' comparison between two separate species. Apples and oranges. You need to give your head a good shake, see if you can't get those marbles back in line. \n \n \n\n Dolph was fine in his reading. His transplantation experiments were exceptionally good field experiments, using controlled transplants under as natural conditions as possible (real lakes, but fine-mesh-fenced off portions of them), with unusually large numbers of replicates for that sort of experiment.\n\n \n **\n Artificially separating the maladapted fish from the habitat they would simply have swum to, otherwise. How 'natural' is that? Be that as it may, in the end, all that his 'science' produced was the truism that organisms tend to do better in environments towhich they are suited than to environments to which they arent so well-suited. WOW!! That's almost as ingenious an intellectual insight as \"survival of the fittest\", aka, \"natural selection\". Well worth every penny of taxpayer's grant money spent on the experiment, I'm sure. Not.\n \n \n\n Nothing is wrong with two generations - how many times do you want a stickleback to grow to adulthood, anyway?\n\n \n **\n The number of generations depends upon the hypothesis being tested. Apparently your boy asserted the hypothesis that one species would immediately evolve a different set of morphological traits and behaviours if evolution was the result of dynamicorganismic response to an altered environment. Since nobody has ever made such a claim, it's a strawman. Testing strawmen is not science.\n \n Moreover, claiming that organisms did not alter their morphology because their genes did not alter in order to alter it, is a total non sequitur. Ludicrously illogical, and utterly presumptuous. And finally, as shown above, showing that growth rates are altered by environments is such a simplistic truism it deserves nothing but ridicule. Certainly trying tomake a connection between varying growth raes between two different species in an an artificial environment that suits the one but not the other, and trying to connect that to your 'principles' of 'fitness' and 'natural selection', is not just stupid, but blatantly dishonest.\n \n \n\n Also, multiple years risks different weather patterns / food availability, so he's better off with many replicates in a small number of years than the reverse. He compared his results grouped and per year.\n\n \n **\n Sure he's 'better off', if he wants to make certain that he only gets the results he's been aiming for all along.\n \n \n\n Variation was well documented by Darwin and others, but since then we understand it quite well, thank you.\n\n \n **\n \"Variation\" was \"well-documented\" by cavemen, painting on walls. Discrimination and identification are a part of every organism's repetoire of abilities. Darwin added nothing to our understanding of variation, except what he stole from lamarck and called 'pangenesis'. The only 'understanding' still required of variation, since the discovery of mendelian inheritance, is the mechanism that brings about the origin of novel variation, aka, the mechanism for evolution. \"Natural Selection\" had, and has, nothing to do with \n origins. That's why Fisher et al had to dream up \"random yet coincidentally adaptive genetic mutation\", aka, the magick of spontaneous generation, aka, 'novel variation just happens, that's all'.\n \n \n\n The inheritable portions of the variation turn out to be of great significance, as that can strongly influence success in life,\n\n \n **\n Nobody denies the good luck of some to be born gifted, and the bad luck of others to be born with limited abilities, or even disabilities. What's that kind of luck got to do with science?\n \n \n\n and we have very good explanations of how it gets generated, \n\n \n **\n You darwinists have absolutely noscientific explanation for the mechanism that generates novel variations. All you have is the pseudo-scientific malarkey that supposes, without empirical evidence or any testing via the scientific method, that the negative impact of an entropic system failure in the organism's mechanism for preserving and conserving productive traits over generations, i.e., the genome, the genetic code, and other codes, has a coincidental, chance-based positive impact on an organism's ability to survive and reproduce in any environment that just happens to correspond to whatever 2was produced by the negative impact on the genome. A load of such irrational foolishness that it is much more a superstition than anything remotely akin to science.\n \n \n\n and why variation seems to be inevitable.\n\n \n **\n Vartiation is only inevitable if you equate 'variation' with simple 'change'. Change is a fact of existence. But in biology 'variation' entails more than simple change--it requires productive change. Productive change is never inevitable, even though, thanks to entropy, destructive change is inevitable.\n \n Darwinists pretend thatproductive change is inevitable simply because destructive change is inevitable. Such is the voodoo logic of the darwinian superstition. \n \n \n\n The one thing it does not seem to do very much is appear on demand in precisely the form that is most needed.\n\n \n **\n That would be magical, but here in the real world, we seek mechanisms, not magic. There are no ex nihilo, ab nihilo, magical \"poofs\" in scientific evolutionary theory [EAM], unlike the ex nihilo, ab nihilo, magical genetic 'poofs' supposedly responsible for adaptive trait change in the darwinist superstition.

A hand of poker proceeds by intelligent culling of cards plus random new additions. Life proceeds by non-intelligent but decidely non-random culling of individuals, whereby the individuals that are doing least well get discarded and the ones doing the best get to propagate preferentially into the next round.\n \n \n You cannot \"factor out\" luck in biology without factoring in intelligent volition, which darwinism cannot do, even though poker players can.\nHe absolutely factored out luck. The fish were set up in randomized enclosures in each habitat. The individuals were distributed randomly, and recieved equal treatment. He measured the growth rates over the course of the experiment.

Just as if poker players had to simply and immediately lay out the cards they had been dealt.\n Certainly in the natural world luck can play a big role, but it is by definition not NS. If you can demonstrate that the results do not differ from \"luck\", then you have proven that no significant natural selection occurred, if any at all. Scientists take pains to demonstrate that their results do in fact differ from what might happen by random occurrence (hence the \"chance\" quote that you failed to understand earlier). \n \n \nWhy neil is arguing against this fact, when it has always been a basic tenet of darwinism that biological evolution is a directionless, undirected, purposeless, ateleological, \"drunkard's walk\"--in short, a totally random process leading to nowhere and nothing in particular, for no reason, is quite surprising, to say the least. Perhaps you've gone and forgotten all your basic darwinism, have you neil? \n Because that's not what the ToE says, nor is it darwinism. Evolution is ateleological, and it is not directed by either a deity or EAM 'intelligence' but natural selection enforces significant ordering of results, such as direction toward local fitness optima. I know that you know the basics of modern biology WW, but you insist on misrepresenting them at almost every turn. \n \n \n \n \nBTW, what happened to the fish once they finished growing/developing?\" \n Killed, I expect, but I don't recall. \n \n \n \n Yeah, and a fact probably first noted by the chinese when they started raising carp 3,000 years ago, but definitely noticed by fisheries management workers in the 19th century when they started using fish hatcheries to supplement wild stock populations of salmon and trout.

I said he demonstrated it in his particular species of fish and his his particular lakes. He expected it, but he tested it just to forestall any uncertainties down the road, he showed that everything was kosher, and he moved on to the meat of the research. He's a competent research and did a fine job at it.\n \n \nAnd a fact that has nothing to do, as I showed in my last post to this one, with supporting the premise that fish evolve via RMNS [randomly], and not via dynamic organismic response to the environment.\n Strawman: I'd say (and the ToE would say) that these two species have evolved in dynamic response to the environment (specifically the presence of a closely similar competitor), but primarily through recombination and natural selection.\n \n \n Your point? Size and production would still be dependent on species, and even at that, the very most that might be discerned from this feckless study is the age old trivial truism of 'natural selection', i.e., that species do better in an environment to which they are biologically adapted than any competitors can do in that same environment when they are not biologically adapted to it.

And to think somebody's good money was spent enabling him to play these reindeer games!!\n\n The point that knocks your EAM out of the water is that these fish did not intelligently adapt to problems posed by their environment, but simply thrived or failed to thrive according to the genes their parents gave them and the conditions in which they lived. You have dismissed this experiment as lasting only two generations (two years: the 2nd yr fish were new to the experiment), but neither generation showed any observable EAM effects, while the effects of the reduction in fitness were immediate and severe. NS beats EAM!\n \n \nWow, I guess \"the point\" must be way out in left field, where this came from!!\n What a flaming non sequitur!

Plants do in fact face considerable and measurable competitive pressure over access to pollinators, and they are in measurable competition over that with everyone in the neighborhood, rather than just the plants adjacent to them. The plants have no way of learning what their competitors are doing Dandelions are generally apomictic so they basically aren't in competition over pollinators, but the buttercup is very much in competition with the apple tree two hedgerows over (or whatever plants happen to be flowering at the same time). \n \n But you haven't answered the question - how, precisely, does the flower find out where it's competitors are placing the pollen on the bat, so that they can place it somewhere else. As the location changes, how do the other plants in the same species know to make similar changes and keep up weith the shift?",

We already understand one mechanism for getting the job done - namely variation and natural selection. The problem is we do not understand or comprehend HOW EAM could in theory account for the observations of divergence between the species to use DIFFERENT parts of the bats bodies unless both species were able to determine the morphology and its implications for pollination of the other species! EAM claims I believe that in this situation each species would have to sense what the other species was doing so that it could change its own morphology accordingly. Is that right?

Thats not an argument its a seeking of shelter behind an attack. Tsk, tsk thats how you lose debates. And if NDS is so awful what do you propose to replace it with thats better. Mysical, mechanismless, unknown, and possibly unknowable EAM??? How so? You still have not even told us how EAM would even in theory explain the real world empirical observation of character displacement in the example we have been discussing.
