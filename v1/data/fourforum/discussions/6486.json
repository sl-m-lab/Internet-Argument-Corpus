   "The ACLU lately has stained the dark side of its reputation through its actions in two cases involving the treatment of vulnerable, young Americans. The ACLU is defending those who abuse children while attacking those who give them moral guidance. This contrast reveals the priorities of today's ACLU.\n \n The Manhattan-based public-interest law firm is defending the North American Man-Boy Love Association in a $200 million civil lawsuit filed by Mr. and Mrs. Robert Curley. The Curleys claim that Charles Jaynes was driven by the literature and website of NAMBLA, an outfit that advocates sex between grown men and little boys, reportedly as young as age 8.\n \n Jaynes did not simply read NAMBLA's materials and ponder its message. He and Salvatore Sicari actively sought a boy with whom to copulate. They picked 10-year-old Jeffrey Curley of Cambridge, Massachusetts. They lured him into their car as he played outside his home in October 1997. When Curley resisted their sexual advances, they choked him to death with a gasoline-soaked rag. Then they took the boy's body across state lines to Jayne's apartment in Manchester, New Hampshire. They molested the cadaver and stuffed it into a cement-filled Rubbermaid container. Finally, they crossed state lines again into Maine, whereupon they tossed Jeffrey Curley's remains into the Great Works River, from which it was recovered within days. Jaynes and Sicari were convicted of these crimes in 1998, for which they are serving life sentences.\n \n So why blame NAMBLA? Is it any more responsible for this atrocity than is Vintage Books, the publisher of Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita? Imagine that Jaynes and Sicari had read that 1955 novel about a middle-aged intellectual's affair with a 12-year-old girl. What if these two men found an equally young female who they abused and killed, just as they murdered Jeffrey Curley in real life? Putting aside the fact that Lolita is a work of fiction, would Vintage Books face civil justice?\n \n Probably not, nor would NAMBLA if it limited its output to fictional depictions of \"man-boy love.\" It is difficult to pin imaginary crimes on actual criminals who turn make-believe into mayhem.\n \n Within the realm of nonfiction, as revolting as its ideas are, NAMBLA certainly has a First Amendment right to argue that America's laws should be changed to permit sexual relations between adult men and third-grade school boys. Most Americans would disagree vehemently, as well they should. That's called debate. It's the American way.\n \n As ACLU of Massachusetts Legal Director John Reinstein sees it: \"Regardless of whether people agree with or abhor NAMBLA's views, holding the organization responsible for crimes committed by others who read their materials would gravely endanger important First Amendment freedoms.\"\n \n However, as Fox News' Bill O'Reilly noted, there is more at play here than pamphleteering. \"According to lawyers familiar with [NAMBLA's] website,\" O'Reilly explained, \"it actually posted techniques designed to lure boys into having sex with men and also supplied information on what an adult should do if caught.\"\n \n NAMBLA is \"not just publishing material that says it's OK to have sex with children and advocating changing the law,\" says Larry Frisoli, a Cambridge attorney who is arguing the Curleys case in federal court. NAMBLA, he says, \"is actively training their members how to rape children and get away with it. They distribute child pornography and trade live children among NAMBLA members with the purpose of having sex with them.\"\n \n Frisoli cites a NAMBLA publication he calls \"The Rape and Escape Manual.\" Its actual title is \"The Survival Manual: The Man's Guide to Staying Alive in Man-Boy Sexual Relationships.\"\n \n \"Its chapters explain how to build relationships with children,\" Frisoli tells me. \"How to gain the confidence of children's parents. Where to go to have sex with children so as not to get caught...There is advice, if one gets caught, on when to leave America and how to rip off credit card companies to get cash to finance your flight. It's pretty detailed.\"\n \n \"In his diary, Jaynes said he had reservations about having sex with children until he discovered NAMBLA,\" Frisoli continues. \"It's in his diary in 1996, around the time he joined NAMBLA, one year before the death of Jeffrey Curley.\"\n \n The practical, step-by-step advice Jaynes followed goes far beyond appeals to sway public opinion in favor of pedophilia. Such language aids and abets felonious conduct. If such conspiracy results in homicide, it is reasonable for NAMBLA to face civil liability if not criminal prosecution.\n \n Ohio's Court of Appeals found NAMBLA complicit in an earlier child-rape case. NAMBLA's literature, discovered in a defendant's possession, reflected \"preparation and purpose,\" according to the Buckeye State's top bench.\n \n The ACLU has offered material support to those who openly preach pedophilia and arguably encourage kidnapping, rape, and murder. Yet this legal group is energetically hostile to an organization that tries to turn boys into men, with sex alien to the process.",

Frisoli claims that this manual exists, but presents absolutely no evidence to that effect. He wasn't able to at the trial, either.\n \nExcept for an excerpt from an 18th-century John Cleland novella involving youths aged 16 and over, and a short story in which a man fondles an apparently sleeping boy, nothing in the material owned by Jaynes could be labeled \"pornographic.\" There were no sexually explicit photographs. Full nudity appeared only in occasional Beardsleyesque drawings. While NAMBLA has offered advice to men accused of statutory rape, what Lawrence Frisoli is fond of calling a \"rape and escape\" manual-- a pamphlet he claims is entitled The Survival Manual for NAMBLA Members-- seems not to exist.\n\n Search engines don't turn up anything about such a document, other than Frisoli's claims, and there's no apparent reference to it on NAMBLA's site. I challenge anyone to prove this pamphlet is anything but a fabrication by Frisoli, who could hardly be considered an objective reporter.\n \n This is not to say I agree with anything NAMBLA is or does, but I do believe in meeting a certain standard of evidence. False claims, even against those who might be guilty of other things than those claimed, reflect only (and not well) on those making them.",

They do exist, and have long been a thorn in the side of the broader gay-rights movement and all but a poison pill for groups like the ACLU. It's easy to support free speech when the views in question are agreeable, but many civil libertarians believe (with good reason) that that's not where the line should be drawn. They believe that no limitation on free speech is acceptable, except to prevent immediate harm, and that therefore encroachment on our rights must be stopped where it first occurs. For the ACLU it's not about supporting NAMBLA; it's about preventing the erosion of everyone's rights. Remember Martin Niemoller?\n \nFirst they came for the Communists,\n and I didn't speak up,\n because I wasn't a Communist.\n Then they came for the Jews,\n and I didn't speak up,\n because I wasn't a Jew.\n Then they came for the Catholics,\n and I didn't speak up,\n because I was a Protestant.\n Then they came for me,\n and by that time there was no one\n left to speak up for me.\n\n The ACLU is determined not to repeat that error. They defend causes that they might personally find repugnant, for the sake of what they consider a more important principle.

That's the biggest issue here. \"Free Speech\" notwithstanding. Why do you think there is a Megan's Law in every state?\n\n \n did you even bother to look at their page? What they are pusing for is a lowering of the age of consent, as well as an increase in responsibilites allwoed to younger men.\n \n On the one hand, I can see this. I have spent a lot of time abroad, especially in the third world, and we coddle our children until they are rediculously old. It is not uncommon to see 14 yr old sodiers in much of Africa, and they are men, not kids with guns (and making a mistake in that distinction will cost you yoru life). Additionally, many historic figures essentially became \"men\" in tehir mid teens.\n \n This leads to an interesting dillema. I certainly don't think that a 14 yr old American should be able to make many, or any decisions, because they are XXXXXX. On the other hand, more than once I trusted my life to a 14 yr old soldier from freetown and thought very little of it. His age was not a determining factor in anything, he was a combat hardened solder who knew his business. I can only conclude that he was so different from the youth we have here becuase he was raised mroe quickly. he was forced to grow up without the endless coddling and immunity form responsibility that American kids enjoy. Maybe passing laws such as those proposed by the pedophile wackos would force parents to actually raise their children as opposed to just warehousing them for 18 years then turning them loose on society. Such laws could have major beneficial effects to our society, like a major increase in the size of our workforce, not to mention an increase in the useful life of an employee.\n \n what does megans law have to do with this? It is completely and entirely unrelated. It is a law for dealing with criminals. We have already established that there is no evidence that this group is criminal.",

   "Two days after World Net Daily exclusively reported on a new book claiming sex with children \"can benefit\" boys and even serve a \"mentoring function,\" the publishing company has announced it is canceling the book in light of the public outcry the story prompted. \n \n \"Same-Sex Desire and Love in Greco-Roman Antiquity and in the Classical Tradition of the West\" features \"scholarly\" treatises by a raft of mostly-Ph.D. academics, all praising earlier civilizations - particularly Greece and Rome - for the role homosexuality played in those ancient cultures. \n \n One chapter in particular, titled \"Pederasty: An Integration of Cross-Cultural, Cross-Species, and Empirical Data,\" has Temple University's Bruce Rind Ph.D. praising the rampant child molestation that reportedly occurred in those societies, at one point citing evolution as supporting a pro-pedophilia worldview. \n \n At one point, Rind writes: \n \n Pederasty, or sexual relations between men and adolescent boys, is condemned in our society as an unqualified evil that maims and destroys. In ancient Greece, samurai Japan, and numerous other cultures, pederasty was seen as the noblest of human relations, conducive if not essential to nurturing the adolescent's successful intellectual and physical maturation.\n In a statement e-mailed yesterday to WorldNetDaily from Sandy J. Sickels of Haworth Press, the publisher announced it has no interest in supporting \"abuse against children and others\": \n \n The Haworth Press, Inc., has canceled publication of the book \"Same-Sex Desire and Love in Greco-Roman Antiquity and in the Classical Tradition of the West.\" The company Board of Directors and Ethics Committee met on the matter and have voted not to proceed with publication of the book. \n Our editors generally have sole authority over what they decide to publish in the journals and books they edit, and this good-faith agreement usually works well, but on occasion, an editor accepts something that sparks negative controversy. \n \n We have decided not to go ahead with publication of this book. We wish to note the majority of this book deals with the historical aspect of homosexuality in ancient Greece and Rome, which is classified as scholarship. Readers have noted, however, that one chapter of the book could be interpreted as advocating adult and adolescent sexuality. We thank the public for bringing this to our attention. \n \n Haworth publishes many valuable journals and books on the treatment and prevention of child sexual abuse (among other topics that address problems in our society), and we wish to reiterate our commitment to the treatment and prevention of all types of abuse against children and others.\n \n The same author, Bruce Rind, embarrassed the American Psychological Association in 1999 when it published a report by Rind disputing the harmfulness of child molestation. Titled \"A Meta-Analytic Examination of Assumed Properties of Child Sexual Abuse Using College Samples,\" the report, which claimed child sexual abuse could be harmless and beneficial, was published in the APA's official peer-reviewed journal. \n \n \"Adult-child sex\" is the next big \"sexual liberation\" movement on its way, warns David Kupelian, WND's managing editor and author of the \"The Marketing of Evil.\" \n \n \"It's amazing how devious these people are. To mainstream sex with children, they resort to pseudo-scholarly research and produce heavily footnoted academic papers extolling the virtues of pedophilia in ancient societies. \n \n \"But the purpose is obvious - to desensitize good people to the terrible crime of pedophilia, and to blur the line between good and evil.\" \n \n In one chapter of \"The Marketing of Evil,\" which has been met with critical acclaim, Kupelian exposes the modern pedophile movement, which is firmly rooted in the controversial sex research of Indiana University's Alfred Kinsey. \n \n \"Kinsey relied on serial pedophiles for obtaining his so-called 'research,'\" said Kupelian. \"For instance, 'Table 34' on page 180 of Kinsey's 'Sexual Behavior in the Human Male' purports to be a scientific record of 'multiple orgasm in pre-adolescent males' - which is based on the criminal sexual molestation of children, including infants and toddlers, for the purposes of obtaining 'data' for his research. \n \n \"It's amazing that, to this day, Kinsey, who is now known to have been a full-bore sexual psychopath, is still glorified as a scientific pioneer and cultural hero,\" added Kupelian. \n \n Last November, Hollywood released a feature film, titled \"Kinsey,\" and a current Broadway musical also celebrates the controversial scientist's life. It's called \"Dr. Sex.\"",

It is not particularly controversial. The subject matter is well documented (that right, all the noble saumari, centurians, and most fo the greek warriors were pedofiles...it was considered part of a young warriors apprenticeship).\n \n Obviously the publisher has the right not to publish the book, and it is not likely to be much of a seller (there is really just not a lot of interest). I would be surprised if another publishing house did not pick it up, though.\n \n I can't decide if this articles purpose is to be critical of the book in question, or if it is just a plug for David Kupelians pathetic book.
