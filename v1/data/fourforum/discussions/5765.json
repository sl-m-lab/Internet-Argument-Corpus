   "That seems to be the biggest question in the debate over abortion. The answer is not a single day but rather it is each persons opinion. \n \n The pro-life people say that a fetus is a human when the sperm fuses with the egg. The extreme pro-choice people say that it is a fetus until birth. I disagree with both.\n \n When a fetus is a one celled organism then it is in no way a human. The supporters of the idea that is it human say that it has the DNA that makes us human. They are right, but so does the skin you shed all the time. So does all the blood you have ever lost. All those cells have the blueprint that makes us human. So it is not DNA that makes us, us.\n \n So what makes a human? DNA gives a blueprint but it certainly does not decide when the blueprint has been completed enough to call it human. The answer must be in the make up of the fetus. Organs, a nervious system, a brain, all these are the things that make us human. Those things are not developed until 7-10 weeks after conception though (depending on your source). Many like to show proof that they start to develope earlier but again, unless something is completed and is operating then it cannot be regarded as developed. \n \n Based on that information I would have to say that abortion should be legal until 7-10 weeks after conception. Once that time period has passed and the fetus has a functional nervious system and brain then abortion should only be reserved for the rare cases that the mothers life is in danger. \n \n That solution seems to be the closest that both sides can get to agreeing though many from both sides reject it because they are to hardheaded to budge. I would like to hear from anyone that has any thoughts on the subject though. What do you think?",

The brain and nervous system are far from fully functional at the 7 to 10 week period. One can even say that the brain and nervous system continues to develop even after birth. So, the important question would be - when is the brain and nervous system sufficiently developed to be called a person (or \"human\", in the way that I am guessing you mean it)? \n \n In my opinion, the deciding factor comes when the brain is sufficiently developed to support a rudimentary mind, emotions, sense of pain, etc. My understanding is that this does not happen until roughly the 30th week - into the third trimester. Up to that point, the brain may be developed enough to control various bodily functions. However, without at least a rudimentary mind, a body is just that - a body. A mind needs to exist for there to be a person.",

If they used the scientific method then it is science.\n \n \n But my question is, why does it matter if it is a life? The term life isn't even fully defined. In biology our teacher told us life is like the supreme court ruling on what constituted pornography. \"We'll know it when we see it\". So what does life mean? Is a seed (embryo) considered a tree (human)? I think it needs to have a few more qualifications than that. Does it have to be able to support itself outside the mother? Some fully alive humans can do that. It really doesn't matter whether it's alive or not, the real moral issue seems to be a taking away a potential life. So the question is at what point is it necessary to continue to raise the potential life. Everyone agrees that at birth they are responsible for the baby. Some think they should be responsible for him/her at conception. Is using a condom wrong? It stops a potential life from forming. The problem is that we know if we were in that condition we would want to live. We can't relate to a sperm or an egg, but once it's one being (a baby) we can relate more to it. When we can relate more we can put ourselves in the baby's shoes more and not want to allow people to \"kill\" it.\n \n \n Personally I don't see why abortions are necessary late into the pregnancy. In the first one or two weeks you would think the mother and father could decide whether to keep the baby or not. Right now I think you get 2 trimesters. I agree we should err on the side of life but we have to think of the mother too. I think abortions should be allowed, but they should be as early as possible.",

What happens to the fetuses that would be aborted but no longer can? They become babies right? OK, now they are still unwanted... what happens to them then? They are put up for adoption as most conservatives always scream you should do instead of abort. So what happens then? mass amounts of unwanted children. \n \n Oh I forgot, they go poof and don't exist because people suddenly stop having sex. That fullfills another conservative dream. There is to much sex in the world!!!! Kill it, get rid of it. Sex is simply to produce babies. Enjoying sex, you don't so no one should! STOP HAVING SEX EVERYONE. Love your gf but aren't ready for a family? Don't chance it with a condom!! Just don't have sex! Sounds like a good idea huh.... lol.

Here at my work (which is a university) we have a College of Science and a College of liberal arts and human sciences. \n Some Departments:\n Biology \n Biology-- Fralin Biotechnology Center \n Biology-- Microbiology \n Chemistry \n Economics \n Geosciences \n Mathematics \n Physics \n Psychology \n Statistics \n Large Animal Clinical Sciences\n Biomedical Sciences and Pathobiology\n \n Then we have the The College of Agriculture and Life Sciences\n Agricultural Technology\n Agricultural and Applied Economics\n Agricultural and Extension Education\n Animal and Poultry Sciences\n Biochemistry\n Biological Systems Engineering\n Crop and Soil Environmental Sciences\n Dairy Science\n Entomology\n Environmental Science\n Food Science and Technology\n Horticulture\n Human Nutrition, Food, and Exercise\n Plant Pathology, Physiology and Weed Science\n \n And look at all the jobs you can have in Science\n \n http://www.sciencejobs.com/search.action?reset=true\n \n \n \n I mean come on now...I don't make this stuff up\n Political Science",

   "\"you ASSumed a lot when you thought that I'd be against condom usage. You were wrong, so right off the bat you made a grievous error.\"\n \n lol, I grievous error huh?? Here are my exact words\n \n \"Thanks to you conservatives the chance of them using a condom would get lower anyway because \"condoms don't work\" right?\"\n \n Notice how I said \"you conservatives\" and not just \"you.\" By saying \"you conservatives\" I am in fact right because many conservative groups are against condom use and are pushing it in schools right now. Hell I saw a flyier in my high school a few years ago that said \"condoms kill.\" You are in fact a conservative and wether or not you personally are against it was not what I was saying. I was saying that conservatives lean that way in general.\n\n \n Oh I see. You like to couch your words with disclaimers. First it's \"you conservatives\" now it's \"many conservatives\" are against condom use then it's \"conservatives lean that way in general\".\n \n \n\n \"And how many of them have had abortions? I thought so. Another bogus argument on your part based on class envy. How original. yawn.\"\n \n So you are telling me that rich people would never want abortions? Then you are telling me rich people don't get what they want? JP you truely are a conservative, you favor the rich. You are completely blind to the real world. I may not know a preg 14 year old rich girl but I can promise you that there are many rich teens that get pregnant every year that have an abortion, if it is illegal here then they just hop on a plane and get one in another country. Appearantly you dispute that.... I'm the nOOb (heh)?\n\n So now I'm a conservative because I favor the rich? emoticon_confused \n Is Ted Kennedy a conservative, or John Kerry? Both of them are rich so they must be according to your logic.\n I don't favor anyone. I also don't envy anyone. Your broad brush stereotypical statements make damn poor debating positions, even for a nOOb. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n\n \"And this \"over-abundance of unwanted babies\", again, that's speculation on your part. What facts do you have to back up your claim?\"\n \n Let me ask you a very simple question since complex ones might allow you to keep dreaming. What happens to the fetuses that would be aborted but no longer can? They become babies right? OK, now they are still unwanted... what happens to them then? They are put up for adoption as most conservatives always scream you should do instead of abort. So what happens then? mass amounts of unwanted children.\n\n Again, you only consider the status quo. When the stakes are increased and the risk higher, the logical conclusion would be that behavior would have to change. \n \n\n Oh I forgot, they go poof and don't exist because people suddenly stop having sex. That fullfills another conservative dream. There is to much sex in the world!!!! Kill it, get rid of it. Sex is simply to produce babies. Enjoying sex, you don't so no one should! STOP HAVING SEX EVERYONE. Love your gf but aren't ready for a family? Don't chance it with a condom!! Just don't have sex!\n \n\n What a concept, responsible abstinance instead of coercing your gf into having sex when neither of you are mature enough to deal with the possible consequences. That's your problem. Morality has no place in your thinking. \n \n\n Sounds like a good idea huh.... lol. I just remembered something, you guys would also turn America into the land of the boring and sexually frustrated. heh.\n\n \n Junior, I've been laid more by accident than you've been on purpose. :) \n \n Now, if you want to quit trading barbs and debate on substance, let me know.

The lines between a potential new life and an actually new life are blurred and so it makes no sense to claim there is a single \"moment\" at which a new life starts.\n \n \nYou are pretty good at moving the goal posts now you are making no distinction about the potentiality to create life and actually doing it.\nIncorrect: I am just pointing out there isn't a clear and precise distinction.

   "Fakultat Katholische Theologie, Lehrstuhl fur Moraltheologie, Otto-Friedrich-Universitat Bamberg.\n \n PIP: The question of when human life begins can be answered in an elementary way: with the union of egg and sperm cells, because this process is the precondition to the development of human life. This would be a comfortable pronouncement if there were no conflict-laden medical-ethical, penal, and sociopolitical interests associated with the question. The hypothesis that unilaterally answers the question of the beginning of human life based on a clear ethical and legal creed regarding the duty of protection of human life from the beginning in the prenatal phase has been found incorrect. Regarding the moral and ethical aspects of social function in a pluralistic society, meaning, understanding, and values are discussed with respect to experiences and opportunities in life to evaluate the meaning of healthy sexuality and partnership in parallel with work, the economy, the environment, and their bearing on pregnancy conflicts. Another issue is the living world, plausibilities, and ethical as well as moral discourse. Socialization means the introduction into a living environment, without which the human being is unable to communicate or have its identity. This is a cultural and structural reality that has its values affecting conflict of pregnancy. Liberal attitudes, moral consciousness, and the penal code also have a weighty role with solidarity, tolerance, and overcoming conflicts without force entering into the picture. The discussion of the German Parliament about Section 218 of the abortion law extensively dealt with the right to self-determination of women but hardly any talk about the duty to respect the right of potential human being. Regarding the conflicts of pregnancy, the duty to protect human life is a moral stance derived from theological ethics stating the unwavering support of life right from fertilization when the soul enters it. In a Christian view the regulations under Section 218 are tolerable because in a pluralistic society compromises have to be accepted. \n \n PMID: 8303917 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]",

Shall we examine how abortion came to be legal in the United States?\n \n In the US, abortion came to be legal by judicial fiat, not democratic rule. Seven members of the Supreme Court decided that abortion should be permissable, not the U.S. Congress. 7 people deciding that abortion should be legal in a nation that had a population of over 200,000,000 hardly sounds like democratic rule.\n \n As we all know, the US Supreme Court's failure to answer the personhood question allowed them to concoct a right to privacy where the decision to have an abortion had to remain one between a woman and her doctor. Justice Blackmun, writing the opinion in wade, said in Section 9A that \"[t]he appellee and certain amici argue that the fetus is a \"person\" within the language and meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. In support of this, they outline at length and in detail the well- known facts of fetal development. If this suggestion of personhood is established, the appellant's case, of course, collapses, [p157] for the fetus' right to life would then be guaranteed specifically by the Amendment.\" Democratic rule? Seven men determined that the fetus was not a person. Democratic rule? More like tyrannical despotism.\n\n \n Sorry for the delay with my response, I've been on holiday and all that jazz.\n \n To business:\n \n Well, I would agree that the mechanism by which abortion access was reached in the US is (on the face of it) undemocratic..... then again how many other binding laws are made through such process in your nation? Many I would imagine- this seems to be the nature of your system.\n \n Also remember that popular opinion is not the only issue that matters when making law (thank goodness!).",

I did consider going into nuclear physics instead of chemistry, but there weren't many jobs available at the time. :) \n \n\n I'd like to know where Sartre was educated, what his degree was in, what kind of grades he made, the professors he studied under, whether or not he's written any scientific papers that have been critiqued by the scientific community, plus a number of other items to shore up his claim to be a \"scientist.\"\n \n Of course, Sartre is not going to share this information with us.\n\n Keep chewing. :) \n \n\n First of all, I'm not really claiming to be a nuclear scientist. My education is in the liberal arts area, I have had a goodly amount of exposure to mathematics, taken a chemistry course, have never formally studied physics and, most important of all, I have an inquiring mind. \n\n By contrast, I've had 4 semesters of Calculus, 1 semester of Differential Equations, 2 semesters of statistics, 1 semester of formal logic, way too many Chemistry courses, including analytical, organic, advanced organic, physical, biochemistry, environmental, etc. Several physics courses, technical writing and a host of LA stuff like Shakespeare, Eastern European Cinema, ethics, yadda, yadda, yadda.\n \n\n I try to stay abreast of current developments in science and medicine, have a profound understanding of the difference between applied mathematics and beautiful mathematics, although it is extremely ironic that my ex-husband, who steadfastly worked at studying beautiful mathematics, has a theorem named after him that has had hundreds of practical, applied scientific useages, my daughter did a search of this theorem and found uncountable references to it in the scientific field, which just goes to show that people who keep their noses to the grindstone in the applied scientific fields miss an awful lot of really important developments in the real world of application.\n \n\n You don't become a mathematician by marrying one.

Only after college have I more narrowly used statistics. But with today's software, which certainly wasn't available in the late 70's, the amount and depth of statistical analyses that I do now dwarfs what I could do back then. Now, I use design of experiment software to help design projects and sophisticated multivariate statistical packages to evaluate the designs performances and plot out response surfaces.\n \n The one area of statistics that I'd like to gain more knowledge about is meta-analysis. This technique allows one to link a variety of studies' findings together in order to gain valuble insight into a process or phenomenon.

   "Hello people, this is my first post on this forum and to be honest, I just googled \"politics\" and clicked on the first link that seemed interresting and I registered, just because I was looking for something to debate about.\n The reason that the first post I make is in this thread is because I think that abortion is a really important thing to be discussed. (because I think it is fundamentally wrong, but I'll explain that in another thread and stay on topic in this thread ;) )\n \n The question that was asked first, namely \"at what point are we called human\" or \"when does our life begin\" is a real tricky one and there are no certain answers for this question, but I believe that one must first explain what is meant by \"life\" before you can answer the question whether life begins at the fertilisation of the egg, the blastula formation or any other moment in the pregnacy. (I'm pretty sure noone thinks that life begins when you're 10 years old or so ;) )\n \n One needs to define life first before one can say when it begins. I didn't think of this myself, to be honest, but the coincidence is that this year a had a course (I'm a student) zoology and our professor, Arnold De Loof) had us read this book (called: Communication, Life, Mega-Evolution) that he wrote and that tries to define life and that tries to explain the necessity to define life to be able to form an ethical view on stuff like abortion, euthanasia, ... The reason that I want to share this with you guys is that I could actually find myself in the reasonning he made to define the point a which life begins.\n \n I won't be able to give a total summary of the book, but a rough summary is that he says that life is the total sum of communication activity by the organism. That means that there is a quantatative dimension to \"life\" (the sum of all communications) and a qualitative dimension (the fact that something communicates) that defines life. On the cellular level that would be the fact that there is communication with the environment by the means of ion-transporting channels and enzymes.\n \n He also states that there are 16 hierarchical levels of compartimentalisation (a compartment being a biological compartment able to communicate with it's environment), e.g. the prokaryotic compartment (a prokaryotic cell that has a membrane that is partially permeable to certain ions) , the aggregate compartment (cells that form aggregates and thus are able to communicate in an intenser way than cells that are not in an aggregate), the syncytium compartment (cells that form a syncytium and are thus able to communicate in an intenser way than cells that don't form a syncytium with other cells), the social compartment (animals like bees and ants that communicate better with eachother than animals that don't have a strict social structure), ... (I understand that this is quite difficult for someone that didn't take a biology course or so, but it's my best shot. If you want it explained good, read the book ;) )\n \n I'll explain his reasonning for the beginning of the \"humanness\" more thoroughly. He first tries to explain when the \"life\" of the embryo begins. He says that life begins in a fraction of a second, when the sperm cell touches the plasma membrane of the egg cell. This is because exactly at that moment, the Ca 2+ concentration dramatically increases (called a calcium explosion) and the cell for the first time communicates on a high level with it's environment and because a novel type of compartment is born, the diplo\u00efd eucaryotic cell.\n \n Then he explains why single somatic cells (body cells, like skin cells etc.) are not full human beings. Why? Because they don't have the ability to do all the following things: form an aggregate, form a syncytium (the gap junction etc. are also included, for simplicity), form a monoepithelium, form a polyepithelium and form a segmented body. Some somatic cells can do some of those 5 things, but only an embryo can do all 5 things. That's why somatic cells are never full human beings and and embryo is.\n \n So, to conclude his reasonning he says that the human being comes into existence from the very moment of the fusion of the sperm cell with the egg, at the moment of the calcium explosion, because all genes that make up a human being are present in the cell and because the resulting cell has the ability to grow up to become a full grown human being. (or as he calls it: reach the higher levels of compartimentalisation)\n \n I hope I have been able to give an explanation about when life begins. It should be noted that this is just the result of a reasonning by my professor and that it is in no way proven right and should not be seen as a scientific proven fact, but I think the explanation is quite detailed and I believe that it is a good answer to the question when life begins.\n \n PS.

But that's the only thing I did in that paragraph.

However you are still not fully making sense. The cells of the embryo remain able to produce all the cells of the body for days after fertilization. This feature is an area of contraversial reaserach at the moment called embryonic stem-cell research. So do you regard every one of those early embyonic cells as a unique person? If not, why not as each can \"grow\" into a full person. There is nothing different in this regard between the fertilized egg and each of the mass of cells making up the embryo a week later. \n \n \nI also never said that the other cells were not \"human\". I just stated that they don't have the capability to grow to a full human being and thus certainly they can't be classified as being a full \"human being\". Of course a human skin cell is a human cell, it contains the human genome.\nIt also has the capability to \"grow to a full human being\" though: the capability is simply suppressed. This is a good thing as it stops a skin cell suddenly deciding that it would be fun to start dividing and producing a mass of heart muscle for example. Ever heard of teratomas? The idea of a a tumour growing in an ovary that contains hair, teeth, nervous system, blood vessels etc put most people off their dinner, but if skin cells didn't have their capability to form all the cells of the body, then such gross tumours would be a far more visible sight.\n \n \nThe reason that life starts with an embryo was stated in the preceding paragraph, being \n \n \nI'll explain his reasonning for the beginning of the \"humanness\" more thoroughly.

The moment the sperm touches the egg cell membrane, the \"calcium explosion\" is triggered and it prevents further sperm making contact. It does not signal the formation of a diploid cell though. That takes a further 20+ hours to occur. As I have repeatedly stated in this thread: THERE IS NO MOMENT OF CONCEPTION. It is a long process. Also what the hell does \"...the first time communicates on a high level with it's environment...\" mean? Sounds like mystical XXXX to me.\n \n \nAnd because the embryo is the only cell that can grow to become a full new human being, the life of that human being begins when the life of the embryo begins.\nLeaving aside the fact that it isn't the only cell with those capabilities, the formation of the embryo is one of the milestones that can be used to arbitarily declare a new life has begun.

Whether an argument is either for and against abortion it will be weak if it depends on the personhood of the fetus.\n\n I disagree. If the fetus is considered a person under the law, then it's right to life is guaranteed by the fourteenth amandment. That's what justice Blackman said in Roe v. Wade. Of course if we look to the 14th Amendment we see that it says that no one can be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. Now, you seem to believe that a simple law outlining what abortion procedures are acceptable would be considered \"due process of law.\" But, this is not the case. Due process of law, when speaking of removing life from a person, includes a trial by jury. A person must be convicted in a court of law by a jury of his peers before he can be deprived of life. It would not be enough to simply say that a law exists outlining what circumstances would allow us to remove his life.\n \n \nAh but within the general spread of the population a person who is black is pretty much the same as someone who is white, there is a much greater range of diversity between blacks and blacks than blacks and whites.\n\n The point is that at one point in history, black people were considered non-persons because they were black. This \"fact\" was based upon the scientific data \"proving\" that a person who was black had not (actually could not) reach the point of development where they could be considered a person.\n \n The same discriminating factors are in use here to say the embryo is not a person. This \"fact\" is based upon scientifc data supposedly showing that the embryo is not developed enough to be a person. Descrimination based upon stage of development is nothing shy of prejudice.\n \n \nSupporters of abortion do not say that the foetus is not a human foetus, what they are saying is that at an early stage of development it may be aborted and the earliest is the less traumatic.\n\n Why can it be aborted?\n \n \nFor instance inducing abortion or preventing conception with chemical means using \"the day after pill\" is not the same as ending a 3 months pregnancy.\n\n Why not?\n \n \nI do not see the parallel between abortion and racism. No pro-choice person has said in this Forum that Blacks are not human.\n\n They are similar because both arguments are based upon the same descriminating criteria: stage of development.",

A group of brainwashed \"doctors\", who do not value the dignity of human life but instead place value on the quality of human life, decide for another individual (without their consent) whether their life is worth living. These physicians have been brainwashed to embrace a \"quality of life ethic\" much like the Nazi doctors were brainwashed to embrace a \"quality of the volk ethic\". Both are alike in the sense that they have broken their oath of \"do no harm\". Instead of being healers they have become killers. One can only imagine the damage which will be done to the patient-physician relationship in this society. How can you trust a doctor who may think your life is not worth living? You better watch out cause they may pull the plug when you are not looking - that is if they even let you make it that far. \n \n \nDrs. Verhagen and Sauer reported in the March 10, 2005, issue of the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) about the Groningen Protocol. This algorithm is used to avoid prosecution in the Netherlands when performing euthanasia on infants. The impetus for this protocol was not that physicians were being actively prosecuted, but that the authors felt that physicians failed to report acts of euthanasia in infants and children for fear of prosecution. The purpose of the protocol is to insure accurate reporting in order to \"prevent uncontrolled and unjustified euthanasia\" and to \"develop norms regarding euthanasia in newborns.\" Their publication in the NEJM is specifically intended to combat the \"blood-chilling accounts and misunderstanding concerning this protocol.\"\n \n The article summarizes 22 cases of infant euthanasia in the Netherlands. The authors outline the criteria by which they considered euthanasia, and how this process should be performed. A review of these cases raises several questions about the basis for considering ending these infants' lives and even more ominous, includes only that small percentage of cases actually reported.\n \n In every case, the prime, determining factor for euthanasia was quality of life. This was defined as having some functional disability or perceived potential to require long-term assistance (lack of self-sufficiency). Other factors included the inability to communicate verbally or dependence on medical care. These factors were considered to be the cause of suffering in these infants. The Netherlands' laws concerning euthanasia find such action legally permissible in cases where a life of suffering cannot be alleviated by any means. By the authors' reasoning, functional disability that cannot be completely abrogated is such suffering.\n \n Should we perceive a disability as inexorable suffering? The infants in this report were stricken with spina bifida, a disorder that causes physical paralysis and dysfunction, but is typically less associated with cognitive deficits. I have many patients that are leading fulfilled, productive lives despite their disability with spina bifida. One, for example, recently returned from a mission trip. Although these patients require special help with mobility, bowel, and bladder function, isn't it the purpose of medicine to provide these solutions? If we allow medical practice to decide what quality these lives might have in the future and 'proactively' end lives of perceived suffering, are we not on the road to eugenics? Once on that road, the human race has not been proven very trustworthy. \n \n In healthcare, we must safeguard the rights of the disabled. This is even more important when dealing with children: they cannot speak for themselves and parents are in a particularly vulnerable position. These children should be treated with special concern, to find every way to help them have fulfilling lives, not with distain, dismissing their lives as not worth living. I certainly can see how the authors would like to correct 'misunderstandings' about their protocol. One thing is not misunderstood: this is a blood-chilling crime against a helpless population. No amount of legal correctness will ever make this a moral decision. The fact that most of these cases of infant euthanasia are not reported only confirms that the practitioners themselves know this is wrong and should be concealed.\n\n \n \nThe dutch policy you have heard of allows for the euthanising of babies with horrific deformaties that are 100% fatal\n\n It also allows for euthanizing those who have deformaties which are not 100% fatal as shown above.",

Not saying you would have to but if there was no one who would ask for him to be kept alive then I would have no problem with him not being kept alive. I don't want to kill all babies, or all coma patients - I just think that when it comes down to a choice they lose to a concious individual.

   "Your principle of viablity rooted in the notion that one's humanity is slowly acquired is extremely prejudice. Why? This developmental view (existing only to justify taking a human life) deems humans to be \"inferior\" on the basis that they are small and not fully developed. Blacks were once deemed partially human because they were viewed by evolutionary science to be \"not fully developed\". The eugenics movement viewed the Jews to be inhuman, and also viewed the handicapped to be \"life unworthy of life\". Do you see my point?\n\n \n Thankyou chloe.\n \n \nBigotry\n Noun 1. bigotry - the intolerance and prejudice of a bigot\n dogmatism\n intolerance - unwillingness to recognize and respect differences in opinions or beliefs\n \n Bigot\n A bigot is a prejudiced person who is intolerant of any opinions differing from his own. Bigot is often used as pejorative term against a person who is obstinately devoted to their prejudices even when these prejudices are challenged, often engaging these prejudices in a rude and intolerant manner. Forms of bigotry may have a related ideology, like racism, religion, and nationalism. Bigotry is not \"intolerance,\" but \"unreasonable intolerance\". Jews are understandably intolerant of Nazi Anti-Semitism; that doesn't necessarily make them anti-Nazi bigots. \n A bigot will continue to hold these opinions even when confronted with evidence that challenges such stereotypes. To protect his views, he may either dismiss the challenges he encounters as an aberration to the norm and ignore the fact that they threaten to undercut his prejudices. On a more extreme level, he may deny the evidence altogether. Both reactions can be classified as forms of cognitive dissonance. See also: zealot, partisan, hate group\n\n \n Courtesy of http://www.onpedia.com/dictionary/bigotry\n \n News flash: please use language in appropriate context. If my view smacks of biogtry then it is equally mirrored by the bigotry of your own position.",

   "That seems to be the biggest question in the debate over abortion. The answer is not a single day but rather it is each persons opinion. \n \n The pro-life people say that a fetus is a human when the sperm fuses with the egg. The extreme pro-choice people say that it is a fetus until birth. I disagree with both.\n \n When a fetus is a one celled organism then it is in no way a human. The supporters of the idea that is it human say that it has the DNA that makes us human. They are right, but so does the skin you shed all the time. So does all the blood you have ever lost. All those cells have the blueprint that makes us human. So it is not DNA that makes us, us.\n \n So what makes a human? DNA gives a blueprint but it certainly does not decide when the blueprint has been completed enough to call it human. The answer must be in the make up of the fetus. Organs, a nervious system, a brain, all these are the things that make us human. Those things are not developed until 7-10 weeks after conception though (depending on your source). Many like to show proof that they start to develope earlier but again, unless something is completed and is operating then it cannot be regarded as developed. \n \n Based on that information I would have to say that abortion should be legal until 7-10 weeks after conception. Once that time period has passed and the fetus has a functional nervious system and brain then abortion should only be reserved for the rare cases that the mothers life is in danger. \n \n That solution seems to be the closest that both sides can get to agreeing though many from both sides reject it because they are to hardheaded to budge. I would like to hear from anyone that has any thoughts on the subject though. What do you think?\n\n \n I've been skimming your thoughts as for this issue which seems to me quite interesting to address as for your personal setting out as well as the subject itself which in afterwards has debated with you some of the points that you are quoting will give my impresion of it rather as a woe that ever may be avoided.\n Until now anybody knows when a human as such has been created, however what we can have for sure is that within some moment of the 9 months that a woman is pregnant, the cells stop to be just cells to give place to the formation of a individual, whether this takes place inside of the period of the 7-10 months, personally it would seem to me a little bit late to consider, what you are proposing is that at that age the abortion be there permitted as long as the life of the woman be there at risk, well i'm not a doctor but by sheer common sense i regard twicely dangerous as for the fetus as well as for the woman sake that the surgery were carried out, so i strongly reject the abortion but i do regard that in any case if an abortion is going to be done it were done within the first months of gestation where at least the woman life underwent less risk to be lost.\n As i said i regard this woe can be prevented, i think women bear here a big responsabilty, none person is brought to this world if a woman does not want to be so, there is a say that says \"the man comes till or up to the woman wishes\", so is there any abortion carried out if a single woman has firmness enough to stop a guy?, of course there is not such a thing, there will be whom says me and the rape cases? well that's another history where unfortunality there would have to apply this extremist resource, but out of it i do not see sticking up to this unfold why should have so many abortion which in my personal slant represents and have no doubt about it a flagrant crime to be done.\n As for its legal frame of course i think abortion must be ilegal, pursued and punished elsewhere in the world, we are talking about no less that as i did bold it of a crime, but i do insist there is a lot to be done to prevent this happens, i mean if i were a woman would think twice before having sex with anyone, that can shatter as her whole own life as well as her to come non-wanted son, daughter, so women around for her own good sake please do regard this and bear in mind that's a man who is advicing this for you.",

   "It is you XXXXX, that can not comprehend. It is not that abortion has no effects, but that the effects are already included in the calculations. Apparently you think of yourself as a scientist. That's a sad joke. And you sign as J.P. Sartre, a XXXXX like you? Only in America....:p\n\n \n Now you're just making a bigger fool of yourself. If you'd have bothered to read the link that I provided, Conklin stated that age could only account for ~20% of the reduction in crime and this included the effects of legalized abortion. Looking at legalized abortion as a factor by itself had little significance.\n here's some more fodder to demonstrate your plunge into absurdity. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n [quote]\n Crime Statistics\n The crime rate in the United States was lower in the 30s, 40s, and 50s, when abortion was illegal. Crime then started increasing prior to the legalization of abortion, and the minor decrease we have seen recently is a small drop when compared to the initial increase. If abortion prevents crime by reducing the number of potential criminals, as the study suggests, then why was the crime rate lower for many years prior to the legalization of abortion?\n \n In addition, statistics show that much of the drop in crime isn't within the \"post-Roe\" age range. For instance, according to FBI statistics, the murder rate for 14 to 17-year-olds in 1997 was 94 percent higher than it was for 14 to 17-year-olds in 1984. Yet, during that same time period, the murder rate for 25 to 34-year-olds (those born prior to Roe) has dropped 27 percent. (source: http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/homicide/oage.txt)\n \n The murder rate for 14 to 17-year-olds during 1993 (born post-Roe between 1975 and 1979) was 3.6 times that of the children who were 14 to 17 years old in 1984 (born pre-Roe 1966 to 1970). In contrast, over the same time span the murder rate for those 25 and over (all born prior to Roe) dropped 6 percent. (source: http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/homicide/teens.htm.)\n http://www.rightgrrl.com/carolyn/abortioncrime.html\n \n \n\n Does abortion account for lower crime rate?\n A new study casts doubt on earlier research suggesting a link between abortion and falling crime rates.\n Ted Joyce, Ph.D. of the National Bureau of Economic Research used the same data that was used by John Donohue and Steve Levitt for their study, titled \"The Impact of Abortion on Crime.\" But while Donohue and Levitt suggested that abortion has reduced crime rates by limiting population groups most likely to commit crimes, Joyce found no causal effect of abortion on crime.\n \n Carnegie-Mellon Professor Alfred Blumstein, director of the National Consortium on Violence Research, agrees, saying that Donohue and Levitt are \"off the wall\" in claiming that abortion accounts for 50 percent of the crime drop in the 1990s.\n \n Blumstein has edited a new book, Crime Drop in America, which points to other factors including prison expansion and waning crack use.\n \n - E.P. News \n\n \n \n\n Donohue and Levitt's contention that legal abortions in the 1970s explain half the fall in the crime rate during the 1990s is couched in what appears to be a scientific study. Yet a closer look at the data on both abortion and crime contradicts their conclusions. Equally important, their argument ignores the new social dynamics that emerged in the wake of the legalization of abortion. The \"selective abortion\" effect that stands at the center of their thesis is nullified by the fact that about two-thirds of the rise in teenage pregnancies following the legalization of abortion were the result of behavioral changes. In other words, legal abortion was a cause of the bad socioeconomic environment, not its cure. As documented in my feature essay, by sharply cutting the net marriage rate and increasing out-of-wedlock births, legal abortion caused a sharp fall in household living standards, especially among \"teenagers, unmarried women, and African-Americans,\" groups that Donohue and Levitt claim will have children most likely to engage in criminal activity.\n http://www.eppc.org/printVersion/print_pub.asp?pubID=2266\n \n",

The true question to be answered is WHEN we have a viable human being. Once we do, all the other peripheral issues that people always focus on (right to privacy, living conditions, rape/incest,) are pretty much irrelevant.\n \n I personally believe it is preposterous and hideously irresponsible that abortions are permitted before we know for sure when human life becomes \"viable.\"\n\n \n Many people here hold the position that a mothers right to her own body is above the right to human life...Some others argue that there is not right to life. \n \n It seems to me that we try to change the definitions of stuff in order to make us all feel better.

   "Chloe:\n \n You still seem to be confused about the distinction between the right to life and life itself. They are not the same thing. Life is not required for rights to be respected, although it is required for the existence of free will. You're making a rather classic category mistake. \n \n In contrast I'm not confusing the possession of freedom of will with the right to self-determination. Conceptually they're similar, but deal with categorically distinct subjects, so I'm not sure what the problem is. Since systems of rights take as foundational the concept of agency and the right to self-determination, the fact that life is necessary for free will isn't a problem. Systems of rights are systems of social conventions rather than metaphysical facts, and confusing the two is the formal essence of the fallacy known as the category mistake. \n \n One is not required to be alive or embodied to have rights, as the personhood of corporations attests, and likewise as you correctly point out one does not need to have agency to have rights. There is no necessary connection between the social conventions of rights and the physical facts of being. Your claim to the contrary, that: \"Becuase life is more fundamental than free will and is necessary for it to exist, the right to life must be and is logically more fundamental.\" is incorrect and ironically illogical in the extreme. \n \n Having pointed that out I think it's necessary to explain how the fallacy of assuming the consequent works. Where B follows A, and we have B, the fallacy of assuming the consequent is inferring that we have A. A professor of mine once unkindly called it 'modus XXXXXX'. When you say things like:\nFrom this, the hierarchy of rights that is derived is one where the right to life is the cornerstone.\n You're saying that a right to life is necessary to have other rights. Given that a right to life is derivative of more basic rights, the consequent (B) of those rights (A), you're committing the fallacy of assuming the consequent. \n \n If you somehow meant something other than what you baldly stated, then I have not committed this fallacy but have committed a 'straw man' fallacy and misrepresented you. Given the unambiguous nature of your remarks, this is unlikely unless you're being intellectually dishonest. In the spirit of good will I'm sure that this is not the case, and it is more likely that you have made an honest mistake in constantly asserting that a right to life is necessary for other rights. \n \n All that aside, perhaps you could explain what it is that you think makes human life intrinsically valuable, as well as claiming that it is.",

The pro-choice movement is propelled by the religion of secular humanism (generally speaking although there might be some exceptions). Secular humanism preaches that there is no god, and even if there were one could not know it (an argument that is rooted in blind faith), and that everything came about by chance. Therefore it would follow that mankind is nothing more then an abnormal wart on the face of a chance universe who has no purpose or dignity whatsoever - everything is meaningless (I still have not figured out why these meaningless people post meaningless words on a meaningless internet forum). This religion and all the sects that branch off from it, has no basis to place any dignity in the human being whatsoever. And since in general people form their beliefs partly from religion, there is no question that religious beliefs is the driving force for the pro-choice argument. It may not be politically correct to say this as it may be taken as one group forcing their religious beliefs on others, hence most pro-choicers wont even touch the religious aspect with a ten foot pole.\n \n Now, what I can't for the life of me understand is why anyone would choose to listen to those who have no basis for placing dignity in the human being try to make a call on issues of ethics and morality. It makes sense that those who, due to their chosen faith based religion, can find no basis for the sacredness of human life would have a problem comprehending a view that says that human life is sacred and all people should be treated with dignity and respect.",

I think that Uncle Sam shouldn't be able to decide what I eat drink or smoke because the government has no jurisdiction over my personal decisions as long as they don't infringe on others.\n The argument that many women will die at the hands of hack abortionists if they are made illegal is a weak argument given the fact that they would be chosing to go to those hacks knowing that abortion was illegal and being performed by hacks. The number of back woods abortions that would occur if abortion was made illegal is no reason to make an immoral act legal, IMO.",

   "It's a hypothetical question, whether or not it's actually \"possible\" is irrelevant, use your imaginations. Its aim is to stress test your moral program. Maybe a group of militant feminists repeatedly gets impregnated and aborts in protest to the new laws, it isn't important to the question.\n \n Presumably, JPSartre, you would support a law against abortion that resulted in more feti being killed - you aren't some kind of wishy-washy moral relativist, are you?\n \n At the risk of repeating myself\n Symbiote: Ah of course, because the law isn't there to serve any practical purpose, rather to impose the will of society through the iron fist of the government\n JPSartre: No practical purpose?! I'dcall preventing the killing of fetuses practical.\n Symbiote: Would you support a law against abortion if it did not save a single fetus? \n JPSartre: Yes. Since I'm not a moral relativist.\n Symbiote: Ah of course, because the law isn't there to serve any practical purpose, rather to impose the will of society through the iron fist of the government.\n \n And so I find my original claim, which you objected to, was correct, that you two support laws which serve no practical purpose, the law must simply reflect your moral ideals.\n\n \n You dream up an impossible, absurd scenario and then are surprised that I give an answer that isn't based on pragmatism or moral relativism, but rather principle. Our laws should reflect our values. If we value life, we make laws to reflect those values. Do you find that difficult to comprehend?\n If I believed that any law that served a practical purpose was \"OK\", I'd be in favor of prohibition of alcohol, drugs, censorship, and a whole host of things that I am opposed to on constitutional principle. IMO, laws must have two defining characteristics. They must be Constitutional and they must reflect the values of the governed.",

   "Absolutely. Because, legal or not, abortion is a choice. Just like skydiving. No one is forcing a woman to get an abortion. NO ONE.\n\n \n Instead there forcing women to have a baby. Why support such a case when it doesnt even lead to the overall goal of preventing \"feti\" from dying, but instead adds to the problem with unsafe practice. \n \n \nWith the medical advancements of our era, unlike the previous era... I think that illegalizing abortion will eventually create a whole new branch of birth control that will allow women to safely \"turn-off\" the ability to get pregnant until they choose to. Currently, the demand for such a product or proceedure exists, but hasn't gathered enough momentum to be developed fully.\n \n Of course, this will open a whole new can of ethical worms.

We do have to set some early limit on when a person exists and forums such as this allow for the discussions that might have a chance of letting us all narrow down our definitions.\n \n Meanwhile, you haven't answered my question about your definition of a personhood, with justifying arguements.\n\n \n ok, so personhood is \"murky\"...wouldn't this mean we would resort to the safest bet? You would think people would rather be sure they are not killing someone instead of \"might\" be killing someone.

When we have a law that says you can't kill someone it is implied to mean person or human fairly interchangably....in fact you probably do it all the time in normal speech. However, getting caught up with definitions leads us no where but trying to justify something with a technicality. A human is a person is someone that deserves to not be murdered for doing nothing.

   "ok, so personhood is \"murky\"...wouldn't this mean we would resort to the safest bet? You would think people would rather be sure they are not killing someone instead of \"might\" be killing someone. Seems like an awful big risk to take.\nTo some extent yes, we should err on the safe side. However, it's all a matter of degree and depends on one's understanding of the development of the human fetus. This understanding can be based on some level of scientific analysis, it can be based on religious beliefs, or on philosophical considerations.\n \n The first step is for us all to try to decide mutually what we mean by person. What is it inherently in the fetus at a particular stage that would make it important enough to take away a woman's right over her own body? For me, the existence of a new human body is not enough, there has to be someone home. There has to be a minimum level of mental existence. Otherwise, who is it that you are empathizing with? There is no \"other\" to speak of until a mental existence first starts. \n \n As I understand it so far, science tells us that, though our brain develops enough to have certain levels of control over bodily functions quite early, it is not capable of thought or emotion until about the 30th week, when enough neural connections have been made along with other developments. I'm not as sure about the perception of pain since pain receptors develop earlier but they might not register as suffering until later - so this area is still more murky from my limited understanding. This scientific point of view, of course, assumes that we are mentally determined by our physical brains. \n \n Religious and philosophical beliefs vary. One can imagine that a \"soul\" (which seems to usually imply a mental existence) enters at conception. I would personally think that God would be very cruel indeed if that were the case. Imagine having a mind in a body that is not functioning. Either way, religious beliefs vary but our country seems to have been founded on religious freedom in that one group's religious beliefs cannot be imposed on everyone. Therefore, religious arguements cannot be used in legally determining the start of a new human's rights.\n \n So where we personally would draw the safety line depends on our beliefs and understanding but society can only go on more secular reasoning in its determination.\n \nAs for definition of personhood...To me person and human are the same thing. To try and make a difference is to justify something. When we have a law that says you can't kill someone it is implied to mean person or human fairly interchangably....in fact you probably do it all the time in normal speech. However, getting caught up with definitions leads us no where but trying to justify something with a technicality. A human is a person is someone that deserves to not be murdered for doing nothing. The same reason I would never kill you, an unborn, or anyone for that matter.\n\n As you say, \"a human is a person is *someone* that deserves to not be murdered for doing nothing\". The very word someone implies a mental existence. We might actually be agreeing on the definition but might well only be disagreeing on when that \"someone\" comes into existence. My guess is that you believe it is at conception or that you acknowledge a strong possibility that it could be at conception so you prefer to err on the side of caution. My view, based mostly on scientific understanding, is that it most likely comes in the third trimester, though the second trimester is murky enough that I might be convinced there with proper scientific arguements (which I have yet to hear). My religious/philosophical beliefs, such as they are, assume that God would not be cruel enough to put a soul into an underprepared body.",

A fetus probably has more \"mental existents at somepoint...but who knows where?\nWhether the little unborn has a mental existence depends on its state of development. My understanding, from what I've read and heard so far of the science, is that humans cannot have thoughts or emotions before roughly the 30th week, when sufficient neural connections have been made. I personally would push for outlawing abortion after that time except for certain rare cases. I haven't heard any rational, informed, non-religious arguements about how thoughts or emotions could exist before that point. However, if someone were to present such an arguement with supporting sources, I would be open to changing my view - I've been waiting for a while now.\n \n As for Alzeimer's patients, the ones I've known or heard about all seemed to have at least rudimentary thoughts and emotions soon before their death. It's possible that my understanding of Alzeimer's disease is limited and that, at the latest stages, they no longer have any brain activity in their celebral cortex (or any other part of the brain involved in thought or emotion).

Play it safe.\nYes, but your safety line is at conception since you consider there to be a fair chance of a mental existence beginning in the first or second trimester. My safety line is roughly at the beginning of the third trimester (30th week), based on the arguements presented above - with a possible few week subtraction to account for any fetuses that might develop early. I place the safety line there since, judging from the science, I see no chance of a mental existance occuring in the first trimester and most of the second trimester.",

Thought does not define a human. We are defined as soon as our first cell is created. It is when the pieces come together to create each of our individual living DNA maps. Only time will tell what that map will produce, and it is not for me or anyone else to terminate that person.\n\n Why is it cruel? It is not more cruel than swatting a fly. After all a foetus is only a person in the making not a person.

How can one recommend death as a better option from death when none of us know how it is.\nSo, you have such a fear of a possibly horrible afterlife, that you would prefer decades of a torturous life? If so, then I pity you that fear. For myself, if I were in the situation of living under uncureable and unrelievable terrible physical or mental pain, without any means of communicating my wishes, I would hope that someone would have the wisdom to \"pull the plug\". So many people feel likewise that Living Wills are gaining popularity.\n \n My view says that I have no authority to make this determination because it is purely arbitary. At LEAST we can say we all have to make the decision for ourselves and this would reasonably lead to one saying the fetus has to make the decision for itself and default at life until it otherwise can decide.\nAgain, this whole arguement assumes a mental existence of the fetus. We simply seem to disagree as to when we think there is a first possibility of mental exitence in the fetus.

   "You get into trouble when you start to question when is a human a human. I am 18 years old. My brain won't be fully developed until I am 21. Does this make me less human. People really should think about this because if you can say that because certain areas such as the nervous system, heart, and brain are not fully developed you can also say that because a baby cannot walk he cant be completely human because humans can walk. Its sad that we start to question whether or not a baby leaving inside of us is human or not in an effort to be able to do whatever you want with no consequences.",

   "The fact is that very good, well intentioned and easonable people disagree very strongly about when an embryo becomes a human based on their deeply held religious beliefes. I will never be convinced that a biological blob consisting of 6 cells in a human being to be afforded any protection whatsoever. Nor can I be convinced that it has a soul. I personally believe that vaibility is the point where abortion should be illegal except to save the mothers life (abortion should always be legal to save the mothers life, we all have a right to self defence). I also have a deeply held religious belief that the greatest wrong a person can do is to bring an unwanted child into this world where we can not even properly care for the children we already have. On the other hand folks like Chloe have deeply held religious beliefs that those 6 cells are a soul bearing, fully vested human being. As a society we need to respect both of those beliefs and get on with our lives and act like Americans and find the common ground where the majority of people will be content, which is very likely to turn out to be somewhere between 10 weeks and viability. The radical pro and anti choice groups should stop wasting their time and money on this devisive debate and start showing real respect for LIFE by caring for the kids who have been willingly brought forth onto this planet so they have the self confidence and skills requried to live a happy, meaningful life.",
