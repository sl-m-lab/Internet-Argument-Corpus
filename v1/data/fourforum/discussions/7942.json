   "I hear there's kind of armistice between Bush and Putin in the Georgia, Caucasus. I wouldn't be so much surprised to get to know of some secret dealing already reached, say in Bratislava or elsewhere. Our piece of pie is Georgia itself while we leave it for Russians to make it out with autonomous regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Good idea imo. We need stability in the vital Caucasian region to do business there and Georgia is the clue to it. But under so sudden and military obsessed president Saakashvili it's not the case. So change of power in Georgia is a must. And those sophisticated autonomous regions stuffed with lots of nationalities are already controlled by Russians, which is actually good for Bush. He may keep Georgia fully in the focus. \n Why Georgia? Did you hear of TRACECA? My vision is that presently our major challenge in the Caucasus is EU. I mean that Transport Corridor Europe-Caucasus-Asia or TRACECA they call it destined to win for EU huge markets of the Caucasus, Central Asia, China and further East. Georgia is vital chain of TRACECA btw. If controlled, it'll be helpful for Bush to meet the EU challenge.",
