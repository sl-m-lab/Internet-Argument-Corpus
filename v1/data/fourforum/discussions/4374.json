   "Newbie here. Please humore me. \n \n Looking into the past, any numbskull can see that if there's one thing constant about organized religion, it's change. Religions evolve. They change (mutate, if you will), they die. It is not reasonable to assume that Christianity, Islam or any of the other current world religions will survive indefinitely in their present form. So where does religion go from here? \n \n Of course the nature of evolution, both genetic and social, is not one that's predictable, but that shouldn't stop us from making some guesses, right? I'll start:\n \n I predict organized religion will have to depend much less heavily on their rulebooks, such as the Bible, Koran, Talmud, etc., leading to a much more spiritual, and less \"Thou shalt...\" experience. This will be because of science slowly chipping away at those areas previously only touched by those books.\n \n Looking even farther ahead....\n \n It is my feeling (not based on any particular piece of evidence), that although there will always be factionalizations, different groups, sects, whatever, that all religions will eventually have to meld into one if we're going to beat the dinosaur's record of inhabiting this planet. I wonder what that religion might look like....\n \n Alll this said, I should note that I don't in fact believe in any religion, but I tend to think it's necessary for large scale social cohesion. That may be a discussion for another time, though. \n \n I welcome your input! (I'd say feel free to be tongue in cheek, but I know some of you will be anyway, so have at it).",

   "yes, religion is changing, and like technology, its rate of change increases with time. true religion based on absolute precepts and values should never have to change if it is built on something that is constant and cannot be wrong. it also needs to be built on something that is accepted as real, otherwise it is no more than a trekkie convention\n \n science, however, is based on realization that what we know now can be wrong, and there is nothing accepted as absolute, since in the real world things change. because what is real is always being newly discovered, it usually conflicts with what was thought to be real when religion started\n \n the interesting thing is, while science makes no claim of absolute knowledge, science is much more likely to determine what is real than religion, who constinuously claims to be absolute and constant.\n \n i predict that religion will completely lose its value in a generation or 2. the emotional aspect (fellowship, mutual motivation, positive testimonies) will very likely be preserved, but the fanciful aspects such as heaven, sin, the devil etc is most likely disappear alltogether",

   "Hi HB - thanks for your input. \n \n \nI think it's funny you see religions as changing, when scientist and evolutionist don't. I can't speak for the other religions, but Christianity has been around for a long time and will probably be around as long as there is a world \n\n \n True, Christianity has been around for a while. To be sure though, it hasn't been around longer than the religion of ancient Egypt, a civilization that lasted about 3000 years. I'd be willing to be that at year 2000 they were feeling pretty sure about their religion's permanence as well. I haven't done any research into this, but I'd be curious to see just how their beliefs changed in that period - how different gods took on different roles, how different areas worshipped differently, etc. Question: If religion doesn't change and evolve, wouldn't there only be one form of Christianity where everybody worships and believes the same? I know, they're all different interpretations on the same theme - but isn't that at least microevolution? \n \n \nChristianity will always have the Bible, it's the foundation for christianity. You can't have one without the other. Christianity as it is now is an extremely spiritual experience. There's nothing more spiritual than communing with God and other christians. Please explain how science is chipping away at religion.\n\n \n Perhaps you're right about Christianity being already extremely spiritual. That's something I simply can't speak from authority on. What I was imagining was a scenario where enough of the stories are regarded as \"simply metaphors\" that strict interpretation gives way to a more personal, open experience. Christians already turn a blind eye to the more antiquated and/or ludicrous ideas contained in the Bible (see Deuteronomy 22:28-29 about rape, for example). Now they are downplaying Genesis because of evolution - and make no mistake, evolution will eventually win in this debate. Science took away demonic posession, it has explained religious visions, even religiousness itself. In the future, will research on near death experiences begin to cast doubt on what we think of the afterlife (or even modify it???), the last great religious frontier? \n \n Granted, this is some extreme speculation, with more holes than swiss cheese, but I hope you'll grant me one point: in the past, the Bible and other religious books were our authority on the way the world works. We had no reason to doubt them. Now we have the sciences to which we turn to more and more. In many cases they conflict with beliefs based on those books. People modify their beliefs all the time based on their experiences and understanding. When enough people change their beliefs, you have a change in religion. Science, on the other hand, only moves in one direction - forward. Thus, in the future, people's beliefs, therefore regligion in general, will have to change to accomodate the knowledge about the world that science grants us.\n \n \nThe religions will likely never meld together.\n\n \n Maybe, maybe not. I'd be curious to see how many religions there were a thousand years ago, versus how many there are now, though. If I were a sociologist, and I saw a signifigant trend of religions being consumed, changed, or dying out as the population grew, that might make me ponder as to whether a hugely populated world can survive with competing belief systems.",

This will be because of science slowly chipping away at those areas previously only touched by those books.\n \n\n \n Welcome fishpower.\n \n If I were to visualize my religious predictions it would look similar to a turtle making a round-the-world trip with a pendulum clock strapped to its back. Frustratingly slow, but less religious with each tick, followed by an interminable tock of conservative backlash. I believe those eras are distinct and unmistakeable. For instance, the 20th century opened in the U.S. with a lot of optimism about finally shedding religion, only to run headlong into the new fundamentalist movement. The 1920's revived some momentum, but was overtaken by world events. The '60's and '70's again saw progress but came under fierce fire in the '80's with new evangelical and old fundamentalist forces. It continues today. \n \n A tick is overdue. Science will provide it as always. Maybe life on Mars will be discovered tomorrow! \n \n \n \n\n \n It is my feeling (not based on any particular piece of evidence), that although there will always be factionalizations, different groups, sects, whatever, that all religions will eventually have to meld into one if we're going to beat the dinosaur's record of inhabiting this planet.

   "Kudos on your apt metaphor, billsco. I agree wholeheartedly. \n \n As for whether something other than religion could play a role in bringing people together... I think that's wonderful. What is it? Science? Scientific thinkinking is easy enough for you and me, but not everyone is apt to think critically about their world, which will lead to continued magical thinking. Human beings owe their success to their ability to see connections everywhere, even where there aren't any. Maybe we'll evolve to the point where we can discern the real from the unreal a little better, but until then I fear we're stuck with at least some form of religion. \n \n Maybe there's some compromise between religion and science on which we can base our philosophies... A way to recognize how fantastic a place the universe actually is, and still be able to revere and respect our place in it. \n \n Or maybe we'll just be stuck with saying prayers, eating Cheetos and blowing ourselves to smitherines in 10 years.",
