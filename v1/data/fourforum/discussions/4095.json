   "So often I stop and wonder about the whole purpose of things and wonder how atheists make it in today's world. With constant wars and everyday hardships with no hope of a better future. For them there waits nothing but the long dirt nap. They feel justified in their means and secure in the fact that there is no consequences for them in the afterlife for their wrong actions in this life. However, I could never accept that idea as many times I have tried. If you take God out of the picture of things you simply end up with nothingness. All the basic things people need are found throughout the Bible. That being social interaction and loving one another. I often feel like King Solomon after he gained supreme wisdom and wrote, I believe, Ecclesiasties....sorry for the spelling....he complains that all is for nothing. No matter the amount of money or possessions and the work you do will sooner or later fade from this earth as you, the individual as well. This is one of the sole things that drives me to continue to live for if there is no God then at least I can say I lived a decent life.....for what is there without God except alcohol, sex, drugs, and other meaningless addictions that simply suck the life out of you just to fill the void. Anyways that's my morning rant.....repply if you want....",

Some atheists don't need something outside themself to find that peace. \n \n You are also assuming in your post that anyone who doesn't have god must be a drug addict into sex, drugs and rocknroll. That is simply not true.",

I guess he's busy.\n \n Honestly, I pity you.\n \n You can't find enough value and strength in living the life that you have, that you have to rely on a supernatural being to give it meaning.\n \n Look at the world and people around you, look at yourself. If you can't find strength, hope and reason in that, that's a shame.\n \n Waxy\n \n P.S. Suggesting that anyone that doesn't believe in God is left with nothing but addictions to sex, drugs, and booze is completely assinine.",
