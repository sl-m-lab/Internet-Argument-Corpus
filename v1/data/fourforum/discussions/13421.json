   "If anyone is actually curious about the reasons for Obama winning the prize, this is the official announcement of the Nobel Prize Committee (from Announcement | Nobels fredspris ):\n \nAnnouncement\n The Norwegian Nobel Committee\n \n \n The Nobel Peace Prize for 2009\n \n \n The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided that the Nobel Peace Prize for 2009 is to be awarded to President Barack Obama for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples. The Committee has attached special importance to Obama's vision of and work for a world without nuclear weapons.\n \n Obama has as President created a new climate in international politics. Multilateral diplomacy has regained a central position, with emphasis on the role that the United Nations and other international institutions can play. Dialogue and negotiations are preferred as instruments for resolving even the most difficult international conflicts. The vision of a world free from nuclear arms has powerfully stimulated disarmament and arms control negotiations. Thanks to Obama's initiative, the USA is now playing a more constructive role in meeting the great climatic challenges the world is confronting. Democracy and human rights are to be strengthened.\n \n Only very rarely has a person to the same extent as Obama captured the world's attention and given its people hope for a better future. His diplomacy is founded in the concept that those who are to lead the world must do so on the basis of values and attitudes that are shared by the majority of the world's population.\n \n For 108 years, the Norwegian Nobel Committee has sought to stimulate precisely that international policy and those attitudes for which Obama is now the world's leading spokesman. The Committee endorses Obama's appeal that \"Now is the time for all of us to take our share of responsibility for a global response to global challenges.\" \n \n Oslo, October 9, 2009 \n\n \n I personally have mixed feelings about their decision. I support Obama and think that he is on the right track in his foreign policy. I am also quite happy that, with his change of tone and approach to foreign countries, the US is at much less risk of looking like a pariah to the world and, because of the renewed good will, has a much better chance now of making substantial positive change. However, that change is, as yet, a renewed hope - not yet an accomplishment. I feel uncomfortable with the Nobel Prize going out for effort and for the hope that he has inspired, not for specific accomplishments. It is one thing to inspire, yet another to overcome the reality of world politics that so often form obstacles to accomplishment. It has yet to be seen whether the renewed world outlook on the US will translate into substantial positive changes.\n \n He may yet someday deserve the Nobel Prize and the early promise of his presidency leaves me optimistic that he will help achieve peace on numerous fronts. However, I feel that this prize is given out too early - before he has actually earned it.",

He didn't have time to wipe his butt before he was nominated. :xcensored\n\n The decisions by the Nobel committee are not done at the time of nomination, so its decision was not based on what Obama had done by February 12th (actually, February 1st) but by the time he was selected (i.e. sometime before today, October 9th, when it was announced). I suspect that Obama was nominated for the prize because of the expectation that he would fulfill expectations based on the approach that he had during his candidacy. \n \n The Nobel Committee web site (Nobel Committee | Nobels fredspris) describes the process behind determining who wins the prize. There are a wide range of people and organizations that can put in a nomination - among others, members of national assemblies and governments, and members of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, as well as University professors and former Nobel Peace Prize Laureates. From there, the committee decides as follows:\n \nAt the first meeting of the Nobel Committee after the February 1 deadline for nominations, the Committee's Permanent Secretary presents the list of the year's candidates. The Committee may on that occasion add further names to the list, after which the nomination process is closed, and discussion of the particular candidates begins. In the light of this first review, the Committee draws up the so-called short list - i.e. the list of candidates selected for more thorough consideration. The short list typically contains from five to twenty candidates. \n \n The candidates on the short list are then considered by the Nobel Institute's permanent advisers. In addition to the Institute's Director and Research Director, the body of advisers generally consists of a small group of Norwegian university professors with broad expertise in subject areas with a bearing on the Peace Prize. The advisers usually have a couple of months in which to draw up their reports. Reports are also occasionally requested from other Norwegian and foreign experts. \n \n When the advisers' reports have been presented, the Nobel Committee embarks on a thorough-going discussion of the most likely candidates. In the process, a need sometimes arises to obtain additional information and updating from the group of advisers, especially if any of the nominees are involved in current political affairs. The Committee has as a rule reached its conclusion by mid-September, but has been known not to arrive at a decision until at its very last meeting before the announcement of the Prize at the beginning of October\n\n \n Apparently, he fulfilled expectations well enough by the time the decision was made.\n \n Though I am uncomfortable with the prize being given to Obama without firm accomplishments yet under his belt, the Peace Prize committee apparently has given prizes in the past to encourage achievement. An article from the Wall Street Journal (Committee Decision Courts Controversy - WSJ.com) mentions:\n \nThe Peace Prize Committee, made up of Norwegians, appeared to have anticipated criticism of its choice. (The other Nobel prizes are awarded by a Swedish committee.) Committee Chairman Thorbjorn Jagland said the prize often has been used to encourage laureates rather than reward them for their achievements.\n \n \"The committee wants to not only endorse but contribute to enhancing that kind of international policy and attitude which [Obama] stands for,\" said Mr. Jagland, a former Norwegian prime minister, said at a news conference.\n \n He cited the example of Willy Brandt, the West German chancellor who won the prize in 1971. That award, he said, encouraged Mr. Brandt to pursue Ostpolitik, the push to normalize West Germany's relations with the communist bloc. Mr. Brandt was elected chancellor in 1969 and served until 1974.\n",

I support Obama and think that he is on the right track in his foreign policy. I am also quite happy that, with his change of tone and approach to foreign countries, the US is at much less risk of looking like a pariah to the world and, because of the renewed good will, has a much better chance now of making substantial positive change. However, that change is, as yet, a renewed hope - not yet an accomplishment. I feel uncomfortable with the Nobel Prize going out for effort and for the hope that he has inspired, not for specific accomplishments. It is one thing to inspire, yet another to overcome the reality of world politics that so often form obstacles to accomplishment. It has yet to be seen whether the renewed world outlook on the US will translate into substantial positive changes.\n \n He may yet someday deserve the Nobel Prize and the early promise of his presidency leaves me optimistic that he will help achieve peace on numerous fronts. However, I feel that this prize is given out too early - before he has actually earned it.\n\n \n I pretty much agree with this. Sounds like the president does, too. Glad to hear that.",

What matters is that the evidence exists that shows that this post you wrote: Despite all of the differences we have had in the past on so many issues, I must absolutely say this:\n \n If you honestly think that the character and type of government that the US has had for the last 16 years (especially the last 8 years) does not need to change, then you are the biggest fool on this forum.http://www.4forums.com/political/current-events-debates/13421-obama-awarded-nobel-peace-price-post374149.html#post374149\n \n Is solid evidence that you misrepresented and misinterpreted this post which I wrote. Especially in light of the video which implicates both political parties equally. http://www.4forums.com/political/current-events-debates/13421-obama-awarded-nobel-peace-price-post374088.html#post374088 But why would I ever expect an apology? emoticon_ic emoticon_frazzled emoticon_xdonno",

   "How incredible that you can see the corruption in a long dead president who actually did accomplish good things for us during his tenure, but you are totally blind to what the current president represents who is attempting to fundamentally change the character and type of Government which leads america today. Here's a video which will hopefully wake you up if you dare to watch it, that is.\n\n \n So you do think that we need to fundamentally change the character and type of government which leads America today?",

   "And furthermore, the film you linked to is a conspiracy theory ridden trash-u-mentary written by Alex Jones. For those who are unfamiliar with this wackjob, please take a second to do a little reading as it will certainly put the film into perspective. Jones is a 9/11 truther, climate change denier, believes that the government has created the h1N1 virus, and pretty much is at the center of every other conspiracy theory out there. \n \n So tell you what Arch, I will give you an appology after all. I was wrong to call you a fool based on whether or not you believe we need to fundamentally change the character and type of government which leads America today. I should have stated that anyone who subscribes to the useless XXXX that Alex Jones vomits out is akin to a recovering brain donor. I just don't think the word 'fool' adequately describes these people. ;)",

   "\n Thorbj\u00f8rn Jagland helped shepherd the Nobel Peace Prize to U.S. President Barack Obama, setting off a war over whether the award was deserved -- and landing himself squarely in the crosshairs.....\n \n Asked about his political values, Mr. Jagland cited a respect for human rights, plus the Scandinavian belief in fair distribution of incomes and the right to free health care that every Norwegian enjoys. He classifies himself in the social-democratic tradition of European leaders whose outlook combines faith in international cooperation and diplomacy with trust in social welfare at home.\n Nobel Committee Chairman Draws Fire Over Pick - WSJ.com\n\n \n And who is Jagland?\n \n\n International political positions\n \n Chairman of the Board of Directors, Oslo Center for Peace and Human Rights since 2006 Chair of the Socialist International Middle East Committee (2000-2006) \n \n Member of the Sharm El-Sheikh Fact-Finding Commission (''Mitchell Commission'') (2000-2001)\n \n Vice President of the Socialist International (1999-2008) \n \n Member of the International Board of Governors, Peres Center for Peace since 1997\n \n Chair of the Socialist International Finance and Administration Committee (1987-1992)\n Thorbj\u00f8rn Jagland Secretary General-Curriculum Vitae\n\n \n I guess the old saying is true.
