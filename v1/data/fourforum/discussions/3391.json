   "I am pretty sure He is, but what do you think? am i right\n\n It is certainly within the realm of possibilities that Jesus never existed as a physical human being on this earth. The objective evidence that can be gathered suggests that it is unlikely a Jesus figure actually did walk the earth as the Bible says he did. \n \n However, with the underlying assumption that he did walk this earth and die for the 'sins of humanity,' many people have claimed that they have come to know this Jesus personally. (Of course, we know this is not possible in the literal sense of one physical human being interacting with another physical human being.) Though many individuals throughout the world have experienced something to lead them to believe that Jesus really was present on this earth about 2,000 years ago, these experiences are necessarily subjective -- as they have been perceived only through interpretation of objective events, or through a personal experience perceived only in the mind of the individual. The fact that many people around the world believe that Jesus literally walked on this earth is often claimed as evidence for the physical existence of Jesus in our actual history on earth. However, this is a logical fallacy.\n \n It is possible that Jesus existed as described in the bible. It is also possible that he didn't. I accept whatever is.",
