   "No. Not to my knowledge.\n \n But, can you provide some evidence that Obama conducts himself like this?:\n \nThis is from the December 15, 2003 issue of the American Conservative, by James Bovard:\n \nWhen Bush travels around the United States, the Secret Service visits the location ahead of time and orders local police to set up \"free speech zones\" or \"protest zones\" where people opposed to Bush policies (and sometimes sign-carrying supporters) are quarantined. These zones routinely succeed in keeping protesters out of presidential sight and outside the view of media covering the event.\n \n When Bush came to the Pittsburgh area on Labor Day 2002, 65-year-old retired steel worker Bill Neel was there to greet him with a sign proclaiming, \"The Bush family must surely love the poor, they made so many of us.\" The local police, at the Secret Service's behest, set up a \"designated free-speech zone\" on a baseball field surrounded by a chain-link fence a third of a mile from the location of Bush's speech. The police cleared the path of the motorcade of all critical signs, though folks with pro-Bush signs were permitted to line the president's path. Neel refused to go to the designated area and was arrested for disorderly conduct; the police also confiscated his sign. Neel later commented, \"As far as I'm concerned, the whole country is a free speech zone. If the Bush administration has its way, anyone who criticizes them will be out of sight and out of mind.\"\n\n\n What Happened to Free Speech Zones? - Barbara O'Brien - Open Salon",
