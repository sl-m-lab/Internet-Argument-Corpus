   "The 50mm prime is a terrific workhorse and very cheap for the optical quality; you've made a good choice there. A couple of our lenses (the 28-200 and 28-105) were bought back when we weren't really sure what we were doing; they're handy to bolt on and carry around all day but a 12mp camera just makes mincemeat of them. That was a real shock, actually: my wife was so excited when she got her D300 but the first few pictures we took looked worse than with the D70! It was only when we tried the 50mm and then the Tamron macro we realised the camera was out-resolving the consumer zooms.\n \n Example from Tamron + D300\n \n Download the original (6mb) and view at 100%.",
