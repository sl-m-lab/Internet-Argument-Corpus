   "I apologize if this message is off topic.\n \n I am taking a college class that requires me to conduct online surveys under a professor's supervision. As a result, I have created a short online survey on political decisions. The survey is short and should not take more than three or four minutes to complete. If any of you would be willing to participate in my survey, it would be greatly appreciated. I am not collecting any personal information, nor will you be spammed.\n \n If you are willing to participate, please click the following link\n \n http://sitemaker.umich.edu/jginges2/social_attitudes_survey\n \n If you have any questions/comments about the survey, post them here, and I'll respond to them.\n \n Thank-you for you help,\n \n Amanda Lamb",
