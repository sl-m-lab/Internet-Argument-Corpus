   "I thought it might be interesting to sign up for Ann Coulter's conservative email news letter (which appeared in an ad here on 4 Forums) for some insight into the conservative mind.\n \n Mostly it has been emails trying to sale me stuff (big surprise) from her or other conservative weirdos in her gang.\n \n I received an email from Coulter's organization earlier today shown in the quotes below. I don't know how to link to the actual email with out revealing my email address or possibly my identity so you will just have to trust me.\n \n \nDisaster 2012: Obama All Over Again?\n \n Dear Loyal Conservative,\n \n In my 50-plus years covering politics, I've lost a lot of sleep worrying about our great nation and its leaders. \n \n But I've never been as sleepless as I am today. Because today, I'm downright scared.\n Obama's machine is gearing up to raise at least $1 billion (that&#8217;s right: billion) to crush us again in 2012, just as they did in 2008 &#8212; by dominating the youth vote, using the Internet, email, Facebook, YouTube. He already has more than 19 million Facebook fans.\n \n Right now, conservatives have no way to fight back against Obama's online juggernaut.\n \n I can't stand by while 2008 repeats itself. I fear it will be the final nail in the coffin of freedom. Look at these numbers.\n \n Presidential Election 2008 \n \n Obama\n \n \n McCain\n \n Unique campaign website visits the week ending 11/01\n \n \n 4,851,069\n \n \n 1,464,544\n \n Number of campaign-made videos posted on YouTube\n \n \n 1,822\n \n \n 330\n \n MONEY RAISED ONLINE\n \n \n $750 million\n \n \n $370 million\n \n Disastrous defeat in 2008 is why Human Events has launched Click to Victory 2012 &#8212; an urgent campaign to fund a powerful new conservative web site aimed at young voters &#8212; and to use every digital outreach tool to convince them to vote conservative in 2012.\n \n Frankly, this vital effort is too costly for us at Human Events to undertake on our own. That is why I reach out to you for help. We must act together. I urge you to learn more by clicking here:\n \n https://members.humaneventsonline.com/donate.php?p=Victory2012&source=UPL908\n \n For Freedom,\n \n Tom Winter\n Editor in Chief, Human Events\n\n \n The \"look at these numbers\" part was in a table and did not paste in the same format but you can assume that Obama's numbers were the larger of the two.\n \n I don't know about you but I found it comforting. :)",

   "This is more stuff from Ann Coulter's news letter. I tried to leave out anything that could be construed as spam in this forum.\n \n\n Dear Fellow Conservative,\n \n The news that Osama bin Laden has been killed by U.S. special forces is a cause for rejoicing.\n \n But now that the man who inspired thousands of Muslims to commit acts of murder, it's time to ask: what inspired him?\n \n If bin Laden himself could talk, he wouldn't hesitate to answer: the Koran, which he repeatedly pointed to as his inspiration and authority.\n \n Yet Barack Obama and other Western leaders have praised the Koran as a \"book of peace\" - without providing any evidence of actually having read it.\n \n It's time they did - and it's time that all Westerners got to know the book that inspires our enemies to commit their hideous acts of hate and terrorism.\n \n Trouble is, the Koran is not an easy read. It's been called \"wrist-slittingly boring\" as well as confusing, contradictory, and muddled.\n \n Now, in The Complete Infidel's Guide to the Koran, Robert Spencer - the bestselling author and Islam expert - shows exactly what's in the Koran, and why every American should be concerned about Islam's holy book.\n",
