Or I could say god is more like a cat than a human ( emoticon_rolleyes ) But what reason would I have to say so? \n \n Thats the catch. Without the bible as evidence, there is no reason to suppose a god even exists, let alone what it's thoughts with regards to worship might be. Thus, dismissing the bible from a debate of this nature, where god is assumed to already exist, therefore the bible is assumed to be (at least mostly) accurate, seems rather disingenious and counter intuitive. Like the opening post really just wants to say \"Ha ha, see how you stumble when I tell you god is real, but you can't use the bible to form opinions on him!\"\n\n \n pfffft!\n \n ..........",

   "1. That is the catch indeed, relying on that contradictory, often [mis]translated, often [mis]copied, out of context, anachronistic collection of the writings of very primitive peoples.\n\n \n No, you've missed my point. The catch is that the opening post assumes that said collection of writings is accurate, but then forbids the use of said writings for describing how we would act towards a thing which is only described in those writings.\n \n One might as well ask \"How would you act in Hobbiton? Please answer without any references to the Lord of the Rings or the Hobbit.\"\n \n If you take away those two pieces of reference, there can be no reasonable assumptions made. Hobbiton does not exist outside of those books, and therefore any and all theories or replies would either be completely fanciful, or reliant on those books.\n \n The same applies here. Any and all replies will either be completely random, or based of evidence drawn from the bible. That's the catch in this thread. It's asking people to describe how they would relate to something only referenced in one place, without using that one place of reference.\n \n \n2. Also, to be perfectly accurate, \"Without the bible as evidence, there is no reason to suppose a Christian god of the Bible even exists.\"\n\n \n Correct, my wording was sloppy.\n \n \nMany other civilizations have created gods for the very same reason that the god of the Bible was invented. This, however, is 2006 and we no longer behave and think the way we did milennia ago, except, apparently, for spirituality. No reason why that shouldn't progress as well.\n\n \n Well, of course we behave and think in the same way. Progressively. If we didn't we never would have progressed, would we?",
