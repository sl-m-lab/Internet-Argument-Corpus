   "The 10% myth may have been started to advance a pro-homosexual agenda, and to more readily (and quickly) mainstream this activity within society, by inflating the true percentage of homosexuals within society to a number that was far higher than their actual percentage within the total population. Most Americans readily believe the 10% myth, and its time to set the record straight: that homosexuals only constitute between 1 to 3% of the population. \n \n \n 1.  Studies indicate that homosexuals comprise between 1 to 3% of the population.  ( J. Gordon Muir, \"Homosexuals and the 10% fallacy, \"Wall Street journal ( March 31, 1993).\n \n 2.  Contrary to estimates claiming that 10% of the American male population is homosexual, only \"a very small number\" of respondents reported that they were homosexual or bisexual. \" 98% of the sample reported they were heterosexual.\"  (Barbara C. Leigh \" The Sexual Behavior of U.S. Adults: Results From a National Survey\" American journal of Public Health. Vol. 83, Page(s) 1400-1406.)\n \n 3. A coalition of 31 pro-homosexual activist groups submitted a friend of the court brief to the U.S. Supreme Court in the Lawrence v. Texas case in 2003, claiming that  2.8% of men and 1.4% of women are homosexual. \n \n http://www.frc.org/get/cu03d1.cfm \n \n 4. In a survey of studies on homosexuals in different populations, The Archives of Sexual Behavior reported a random sample of Hawaii state residents interviewed by telephone. The study found  \"just about 3% of males and 1.2% of females as having engaged in same-sex or bisexual activity.\"  ( Milton Diamond, \"Homosexuality and Bisexuality in Different Populations,\" Archives of Sexual Behavior 22 (1993): 300)\n \n 5. A study of the sexual behavior of men in the U.S. based on the National Survey of Men (A nationally representative sample comprised of 3,321 men aged 20-39) found that  2% of men aged 20-39 had had any same-gender activity during the last ten years. Approximately 1% of the men (1.3% among whites and 0.2% among blacks) reported having had exclusively homosexual activity.  (John O. G. Billy, \"The Sexual Behavior of Men in the United States, \"Family Planning Perspectives 25 (March/April 1993): 58)\n \n 6. The percentage of men claiming to be homosexual is far less than Alfred Kinsey's claims(later retracted) that 10% of American Males were homosexual and that 37% of men had some homosexual experience during their life. The National Survey of Men reports that  \"2.3% of men. aged 20-39, have had \"same gender sexual activity during the preceding ten years\" and that \"1.1% have had such activity exclusively.\" In addition, \"the majority of men who have had homosexual contact report that such contact occured 'once, twice or rarely for less than 2 years.  (The National Survey of Men) (Stuart H. Seidman, And Ronald O. Reider) \"A Review of Sexual Behavior in the United States\" The American Journal of Psychiatry Vol. 151 1994 page(s) 330-339)\n \n 7.  Current studies estimate that between 1.8 to 3% of the male population consider themselves to be homosexual with the rate for females at 1.5% ( Herral, R (1999) A Co-Twin Control Stduy in Adult Men\" Archives of General Psychiatry. 56, 10: 867-874)\n \n In addition, studies by John H. Gagnon, Edward O. Laughmann, and others show, as well, that homosexuals and lesbians constitute between 1 to 3% of the population. The 10% myth was a distortion started by Alfred Kinsey in 1938-1948. Kinsey later retracted that percentage and accepted that homosexuals make up only 1 to 4% of the total population.",
