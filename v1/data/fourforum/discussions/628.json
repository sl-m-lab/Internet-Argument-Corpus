Maybe he means that science, without people treating it like a religion (loving and in a way worshipping knowledge) won't work. That'd be my take on it at least, but hey, I'm not Einstein.\n \n As for the Christian martyrs... which ones? There were several Christs, and they probably all had martyrs.",

Besides that, Judaism was only his heritage and not his religion. He stated that he believed in Spinoza's God. Of course, I wouldn't expect anyone who claimed that Einstein believed in Jesus to actually be concious enough to know what the means.\n \n Tell me, Sakata. Did it ever cross your mind that you should actually learn about the things that you claim are true? Do you think that making yourself look like a fool bring credit to Jesus?\n \n What an embarrassment to Christianity!",
