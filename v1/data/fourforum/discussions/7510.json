   "The Oscar Nominations have been posted. I was wondering who/what everyone thinks should/would win in which catagory.\n \n To be entirely honest, I'm upset with the best score nominations.[*]Brokeback Mountain[*]The Constant Gardner[*]Memoirs Of A Geisha[*]Munich[*]Pride & Prejudice\n The 2 linked ones were both a score done by John Williams. Now I have noting against John Williams (Star Wars, Indiana Jones, E.T., Jurassic Park) but this is the reason they stoped having an oscar for best special effects. It was because it wound up being the same group against the same group. Incase you don't know, I'm big on music.\n \n Anyway, enough with my rants. What are your picks.",
