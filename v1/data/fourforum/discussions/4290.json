It didnt work at all they lost money then removed the drinks. I think it was an excellent plan except it was the most disgusting thing to go down my throat hole",

   "Actually, it makes no sense the way they do it for us. They will sell greasy pizza with fries and cheesburgers, all very unhealthy. As long as it's not in a vending machine it can be as unhealthy as they want. But they can't sell a bag of chips in vending machines. They'll sell you a greasy hamburger, pizza, fries, etc. but not a bag of chips.\n \n Now I never bought food from the school anyway. The burgers and pizza looks pretty disgusting and the vending machine foods were always so expensive.\n \n But now that they've only put healthy foods in the vending machines they aren't making as much money, and they wonder why.",
