   "First of all, let us look at the definition of what an IC system is, according to Behe\n \n From Darwin's black box\n \n \n\n By irreducibly complex I mean a single system composed of several well-matched, interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning. An irreducibly complex system cannot be produced directly (that is, by continuously improving the initial function, which continues to work by the same mechanism) by slight, successive modifications of a precursor system, because any precursor to an irreducibly complex system that is missing a part is by definition nonfunctional. An irreducibly complex biological system, if there is such a thing, would be a powerful challenge to Darwinian evolution. (p. 39)\n \n\n \n Now, lets take a look at an experiment that can be repeatedly done in the lab that demonstrates that evolution of a IC system.\n \n This experiment was first done by Barry Hall of the University of Rochester in 1982. It was also described in Kennth Miller's book \"Finding Darwin's God\" (printed in 1999),\n I will point out this experiment was done 14 years before Behe's book \"Darwin's black Box\" was published.\n \n What Barry Hall did is remove the gene to digest lactose from some bacteria. He then let the bacteria grow until he had a culture of billions descended the single bacteria he had removed the gene from. He then subjected the bacteria colony to environmental pressures, and eventually only gave the culture lactose to survive. \n \n For this to have worked, not just 1 gene had to evolve, but 3 different (i.e. multiply part) systems had to evolve. Not only did you need a gene for it, but you had to have a regulatory gene, and the evolution of a new enzyme reaction to allow lactose to get into the cell. In other words, this just wasn't a single gene that had to evolved, but a whole system.\n \n This experiment demolishes the idea that an IC system can not evolve, and destroy's Behe's premise that an IC system points to a designer.",

Hall wrote in 1999: \"All of the other functions for lactose metabolism, including lactose permease and the pathways for metabolism of glucose and galactose, the products of lactose hydrolysis, remain intact, thus re-acquisition of lactose utilization requires only the evolution of a new B-galactosidase function.\"[2] (my emphasis)\n \n Therefore, Miller's claim that an entire multiple part system was deleted is actually false, according to his own source. Instead, it turns out, only one part of the system (the B- galactosidase) was removed. In order to \"re-activate\" the B-galactosidase function, two separate mutations occurred in two separate genes: the so-called \"evolved B-galactosidase\" gene (ebg) and the repressor protein for ebg.\n \n Second, Hall introduced an artificial inducer into the growth medium, which was necessary for the survival of the mutated bacteria. Thus, vital steps in the \"evolution\" of said \"system\" were actually supported by intelligent intervention.\n \n Also, if you would like to see the biochemical details, here is an additional objection from Behe:\n \n \nThe nature of adaptive mutation aside, a strong reason to consider the lac/ebg results quite modest is that the ebg proteins--both the repressor and B-galactosidase--are homologous to the E. coli lac proteins and overlap the proteins in activity. Both of the unmutated ebg proteins already bind lactose. Binding of lactose even to the unmutated ebg repressor induces a 100-fold increase in synthesis of the ebg operon. (Hall 1982a) Even the unmutated ebg B-galactosidase can hydrolyze lactose at a level of about 10% that of a \"Class II\" mutant B-galactosidase that supports cell growth. (Hall 1999) These activities are not sufficient to permit growth of E. coli on lactose, but they already are present. The mutations reported by Hall simply enhance pre-existing activities of the proteins. In a recent paper (Hall 1999) Professor Hall pointed out that both the lac and ebg B-galactosidase enzymes are part of a family of highly-conserved B-galactosidases, identical at 13 of 15 active site amino acid residues, which apparently diverged by gene duplication more than two billion years ago. The two mutations in ebg B-galactosidase that increase its ability to hydrolyze lactose change two nonidentical residues back to those of other B-galactosidases in ebg's phylogenetic class, so that their active sites are identical. Thus--before any experiments were done--the ebg active site was already a near-duplicate of other B-galactosidases, and only became more active by becoming a complete duplicate. Significantly, by phylogenetic analysis Hall concluded that those two mutations are the only ones in E. coli that confer the ability to hydrolyze lactose. \n The phylogenetic evidence indicates that either Asp-92 and Cys/Trp-977 are the only acceptable amino acids at those positions, or that all of the single base substitutions that might be on the pathway to other amino acid replacements at those sites are so deleterious that they constitute a deep selective valley that has not been traversed in the 2 billion years since those proteins diverged from a common ancestor. (Hall 1999)\n\n All of this is really complex, but when the tire meats the road, we see that this is not an example of the evolution of an irreducibly complex system.\n \n  References:\n \n 1.
