   "When creationists critique the evidence for human evolution, they tend to home in on hominid fossils, which they try to dismiss as deformed humans or as apes drowned in the flood. What is hardly ever addressed in creationist literature is the cultural evolution of modern man himself.\n \n We have evidence of Stone Age culture dating back 2 000 000 years. If, to avoid arguing over the status of earlier types, we restrict ourselves solely to H. sapiens, the Stone Age still goes back over 100 000 years, over which time - some 5000 generations - there was a long, slow evolution of stone technology.\n \n How do biblical creationists deal with these generations, so oddly missing from Genesis? Straightforward observation tells us there was a Stone Age, and it was very, very long. According to the bible, there was none: in Genesis 4, Adam's own son builds a city, and Cain's great-great-great-grandson Tubalcain is already an iron worker. I would be interested to hear from creationists (of any ilk) on their resolution of this contradiction.",
