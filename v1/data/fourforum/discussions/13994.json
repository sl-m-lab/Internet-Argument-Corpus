This was BAD.\n \n However, people continued to believe in and bruit that Official Truth despite increasing scientific evidence to the contrary, until two millennia later they are still trying to create a governmental tyrrany based on \"our truth or the highway,\" and bad-mouthing and condemning to hell people on internet fora who dare to prefer reality to primitive myth.\n \n Which may not be as bad as burning at the stake, but which is still pretty damn bad.\n \n Upshot: the good part was good a LONG time ago and negligibly good today.

Once again you are ignorant of the work of the Holy Spirit in the life of the believer:\n \n Life Through the Spirit  - Romans Chapter 8\n \n 1 Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, 2 because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit of life set me free from the law of sin and death. \n \n What's that Paul wrote, pappi??  \"there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus...\"\n \n Oh, happy days!!!  \n \n Bet you wish you had that coverage, because right now you're dead in your sins without any get out of jail free card (unless you repent and receive Christ as your Lord and Savior for the remission of your many sins).\n \n 3 For what the law was powerless to do in that it was weakened by the sinful nature, God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful man to be a sin offering.And so he condemned sin in sinful man, 4in order that the righteous requirements of the law might be fully met in us, who do not live according to the sinful nature but according to the Spirit. \n \n 5Those who live according to the sinful nature have their minds set on what that nature desires; but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires. 6The mind of sinful man is death, but the mind controlled by the Spirit is life and peace; 7the sinful mind is hostile to God. It does not submit to God's law, nor can it do so. 8Those controlled by the sinful nature cannot please God. \n \n 9You, however, are controlled not by the sinful nature but by the Spirit, if the Spirit of God lives in you. And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ. 10But if Christ is in you, your body is dead because of sin, yet your spirit is alive because of righteousness. 11And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit, who lives in you. \n \n Have you read your Bible? Why did you miss all that? \n \n \nAgain you missed the point. Jesus is not the answer for everybody, even the most faithful Christian struggles at times with religion.\n\n \n True Christianity is not a religion - it's a personal relationship with Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit.

If they can figure out how to farm and build aquaducts they can figure out there needs to be some sort of structure that makes staying worthwhile. The earliest forms of religion were not about treating each other with respect. There is no reason to think religion caused morality, more likely intelligence and wisdom in maintaining a working social structure caused morality as we understand it. \n \n \nWould civilization have existed without morality, yes. Would it have lasted, probably not. I'm not aware of any immoral civilization that survived throughout the ages.\n\n \n How many Theocratic civilizations have survived through the ages, for that matter how many civilizations period have survived throughout the ages. Religion nor morality make an empire last forever.\n \n As stated above morality is a necessary component to civilization, but religion is not the originating cause. Morality is different depending on time and cultural values. South American Indians found human sacrifice as part of religion moral. Mutilation is moral because of religion today in parts of Africa and the middle east. Our morality that we attribute to religion disagrees with practices like those. This is something that Christian and Atheist can agree on.\n \n \n \nIt was the monestaries that meticulously copied the original Greek manuscripts and translated them into other languages. You can be the smartest man on earth, but if you don't know the language, the books have no meaning for you.\n \n \n Monks I agree did copy many texts from the greek intelliluctuals, but they also decided which ones that would be copied and which were deemed heretical or of no value. Imagine if they were copied without regard to whether they spoke of something contrary to religion.\n \n The Greeks were remarkably advanced despite their religion. They were allowed to come to conclusions that didn't always end up with the Gods as the answer. This occurs repeatedly in history. \n \n \n \nYou look at a relatively civilized world now and proclaim that religion is unnecessary. Go back 400 years and make that same claim. It was religion that drove our ancestors to the Americas.\n\n \n Yes it was, I don't see how that supports the need for religion though. As a side note it seems our ancestors were all for religious intolerance, they just didn't like being the ones not tolerated. As the Indians were to discover shortly after the arrival of the Pilgrims.\n \n \nYou look at the world in which religion has been used by some to manipulate others and say \"religion's bad\". I think about what it'd be like without the morality that religion brought and wonder how much worse it could have been without religion. Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Pol Pot, etc., all had no moral compunction against murdering millions.\n\n \n I disagree that religion is the cause of morality. I don't deny that religion has not always been bad. You can't say that there is only good because of religion or bad is a lack of religion. There will be people who are driven to control other people religion breeds them just as a lack of religion does. Religious morality doesn't always agree and neither does religion. If man as you say has a tendency to act aggressively towards his fellow man religion just adds more reasons why he is justified in doing so. There are very few religions that preach specifically on man acting with compassion towards others.\n \n \n For the opening statement to be valid religion need only be bad once more than half.

   "Early religions engendered the concept of man being subservient to a higher being. This higher being's needs were placed above man's individual needs. The sense of community came about by trying to satiate the needs of their gods. The ancient Egyptians were as advanced as they were because they believed their pharaohs were gods and sacrificed greatly to please them. While it's traditional to believe that the pyramids were built by slaves, they weren't. They were built by skilled artisans.\n \n \n Eventually that happened and is what we see currently in religion, but it didn't start that way. Cave paintings don't depict images of Gods or the supernatural. Man sacrificed to gain something or for protection. His intent was not simply to honor the Gods for that reason alone. \n \n People settled because of agriculture not to please the Gods. Man copied or it was instinctual to be a pack animal. Nomadic people formed tribes, tribes became farmers, farms became villages and then towns and cities. Religion was present and played a role, but is not what caused growth or kept the inhabitants from going back to being nomadic. \n \n The Pharaoh's of Egypt were thought to be the incarnation of or appointed by any number of Gods in their pantheon, but not until they ascended to power. That isn't really supporting the idea that religion was the motivation behind their advances. Looking at other cultures who did not view their Kings as Gods also were able to match the Egyptians, maybe not in quantity, but in quality. \n \n Whether built by slaves or skilled artisians doesn't do much for the argument.\n \n \nYou set up a strawman argument. A civilization doesn't have to be theocratic to be governed by religious-based morality. Ever hear of the Church of England?\n\n \n No straw-man, unless you take it out of context like you did. You put forth civilization could not survive without religion based morality I countered that with what civilization religious or not has survived throughout the ages. Meaning that morality does not decide whether an empire survives. \n \n But even if morality was a factor, morality is not the result of religion. The main religions of today have intertwined with them a value system that is respectful to a degree of man's relations with man, but it was not the belief that to do so would please a God that birthed this concept.\n \n \n \nSo you're calling SA cannibals \"civilization\" now? Another strawman.\n\n \n Weak! The Incas are what, a group of monkeys? In Mexico and Central America Mayan, Aztec and the Toltecs don't count? Why because their religion made them uncivilized?\n \n \nIt appears to me that you want to have it both ways. You chastise monks for selecting what they copied but agree that it was a good thing that they copied anything in the first place. Without monks that not only copied, but translated documents, all of that Grecian civilization would have been lost. PERIOD.\n\n \n Basically what your saying is that the only compulsion man would have to record his history and knowledge is due to religion. Which is ridiculous. If the monks of the middles ages were so concerned with doing so they would have been significantly less selective than they were. \n \n \nAre you kidding? The Greeks had gods for everything.\n\n \n Exactly and what does that tell you. Religion is the fall back answer for the unknown. How many of those things that were attributed to Gods have been shown to have an explanation that did not involve any deity?\n \n \nReligion drove men to take risks, to go on quests, to fight wars. The majority of these were beneficial.\n\n \n And many would have happened without religion. You seem to always fall back on the idea that man would still be using stone tools, have no language and be completely indifferent to his surroundings without religion. Religion was not the driving force behind science, exploration or conquest. To the dismay of many it did play a larger role in conquest and conversion than the other two, but religion has to often been a tool of control and power.\n \n \nI disagree. Most religions preach compassion. Maybe you should try reading about some of them. Start with Hinduism and their 10 Commitments.\n\n \n You mean the Hindu religion that developed the caste system and the untouchables? There is control I mean compassion with a capital C. Many modern day religion focus on submission to God and being nice to one another, but that isn't always the way it has been. Even todays compassionate religions started out with blood sacrifice, severe forms of punishment and intolerance.\n \n \nHow many charities are run by atheist groups? Compare that with religious charities.\n\n \n So charities run today are the best you can do for why religion has been of greater benefit than not. I suppose religion has a lock on the concept, right. If it wasn't for religion people would not have even thought of the idea. emoticon_rolleyes",

It's the default state because it's programed into us from infancy. Your right that a child would need to grow up in a vacuum to not have some belief system pumped into him/her. Finding some bush child thinking he is Mogli wouldn't help because it's the inability to explain the world we live in that brought in the idea of some great intelligent being(s).\n \n I would disagree that religion has been anything but an obstacle to science. Many intelligent people have been able to balance religion with knowledge and in doing so look beyond God as the solution to a problem, but history proven time and again that science and religion are not walking hand in hand down lovers lane.",
