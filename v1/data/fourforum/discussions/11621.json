HERE'S my link, and it say's nothing about an affiliation with the AOG.\n Ministry and theology\n \n \n Wikiquote has a collection of quotations related to:\n Benny Hinn\n Benny Hinn promotes himself as a Christian healing evangelist and Bible teacher. He is the author of a number of best-selling inspirational Christian books. His thirty-minute TV program This Is Your Day, is among the world&#8217;s most-watched Christian programs, seen on various Christian television networks, including Trinity Broadcasting Network, Daystar Television Network, Revelation TV, The Christian Channel, Vision TV, INSP Networks, and The God Channel.\n Hinn conducts regular \"Miracle Crusades\" &#8211; revival meeting/faith healing events held in sports stadiums in major cities throughout the world.\n Hinn's teachings are based on Word of Faith theology which espouse belief in the inerrancy of the Bible, contemporary works of the Holy Spirit and the \"perpetuity of spiritual gifts\" which includes activities such as 'speaking in tongues', faith healing, exorcism, and consequential financial prosperity. The doctrine and practices regarding theological interpretation and worship which Hinn teach are only partly accepted by mainstream Christianity.[citation needed] Although widely accepted by the Charismatic Christian community (Christian believers who subscribe to the tenets of the Charismatic Movement and whom, according to a recent study by The Barna Group, make up 46% of US Protestants and 36% of US Catholics[6]), there are many others in mainstream Christianity who do not subscribe to these particular beliefs. With that in mind, no Christian denomination has a theology that is accepted in totality by everyone in mainstream Christianity. Specific concerns of Hinn's critics include a lack of transparency regarding his personal income derived from ministry, disputes as to substantial claims that the sick are actually healed through his ministry.\n Can you point out where he is said to be attached to the Assembly of God church trebor?",
