   "Don't know if been mentioned here yet, but I found this to be hilarious.\n \n www.venganza.org\n \n Here's an exert from Wiki:\n \n Many of the \"beliefs\" proposed by Henderson were intentionally chosen to parody arguments commonly set forth by proponents of Intelligent Design:\n \n * An invisible and undetectable Flying Spaghetti Monster created the universe, starting with a mountain, trees and a \"midgit\". All evidence pointing towards evolution was intentionally planted by this being.\n \n * Global warming, earthquakes, hurricanes, and other natural disasters are a direct consequence of the decline in numbers of pirates since the 1800s. A graph showing the inverse correlation between the pirates and global temperatures was also provided. This component of the theory highlights the logical fallacy of correlation implying causation.\n \n * The monster continues to guide human affairs with his \"noodly appendage\".\n \n * Prayers to \"Him\" are typically ended by \"Ramen\", instead of \"Amen\".\n \n * Heaven has a stripper factory and a beer volcano.\n \n * Bobby Henderson is the \"prophet\" of this religion.\n \n * Every Friday is a religious holiday.",
