   "Since 2002 the US has been in talks with Poland over the possibility of setting up a European base to intercept long-range missiles. A site similar to the US base in Alaska would help protect the US from missiles fired from the Middle East and North Africa. However, this plan is facing strong opposition both in Europe and Poland itself. Europe's protesting is based on the fact that interceptors launched out of southern Poland would have to overfly other European countries and that lower stages of the interceptors would fall there which is certainly to affect ecology. Europe's worries are accompanied with that of population of Poland in the part of falling lower stages. Besides, such outstanding military project as a US NMDS silo is certainly to attract attention of transnational terrorists - today there are quite a number of Chechen refugees in Poland who are said to be having murky past, namely, some of them used to be militants and used to fight in Iraq on the part of insurgents against US Army during Iraq campaign and certainly have links with al-Qaida. Knowing the threat of terror attacks against Poland, and people's unrest in this connection, the new Poland's prime minister Kazimir Marcinkiewicz (oh my, I hope I can pronounce it) said the government was ready to start negotiations with the US, and added he was expecting good gain in this connection as the US is to offer some $20ml to $25ml annually for permission to deploy a NMDS base. Anyway, this sum is not likely to exceed the material losses connected with the damage to Poland's nature. It is known that a military base (especially if it has to do with missiles) does very serious and irretrievable environmental damage. Testing missile launches, oil draining, toxic materials that form the basis of missile fuel, radioactive contaminants - all this will be polluting mountainous territory of southern Poland. IS it really worth the money? I don't think so. Now it is up to the Poles, if they say NO to American national missile defence system, they will save their lives and nature. If they agree, they will be the losers.",

   "Looks like Poles were born yesterday. Don't they know that it is dangerous haggling with Americans? First they gave OK to placing constituents of US antiballistic missile system on Polish territory. Now Poland thought that it sold itself at low price. It wants to show that it is expensive courtesan and demands fabulous indemnity for its compliance.\n But USA is experienced customer. They don't bear any blackmailing and already have made first warning. For recent air crash of Polish EADS Casa in January 24 when 15 high military personnel and 4 crew died wasn't an accident.\n It was provocation planned thoroughly and very scoffing. You see those officers had been returning from annual conference on air security in Warsaw. That's really famous American black humor. They showed Poles that their arrogance, and Jewish mercenariness, and their own security cost nothing.\n Has everyone bought more pop-corn? I'm waiting for the second series.",

   "American Anti-Missile Defence planting in Europe will not be limited just by Poland and Czechia. Pentagon is planning to place its elements in Turkey too! I think that so US' plans are just new confirmation that this Anti-Missile program directs not only Iran and Russia but China and Central Asia countries as well! So to speak they form the Evil Axis but if we see the situation in real terms we'll see that US government's trying to create artificial image of enemy for their own nation! I think that the White House needs it for calming nation and directing its anger against far-fetched enemies as their own politicians!",

   "Hey! As I see, official Washington is not likely to pardon Poland for the unreasonable and excessive intractability in the matter of deployment of the US missile defense system. Warsaw was demanding too much, that's why Washington decided to start using stick motivation instead of carrot. Have you heard about Silesia? It's a territory rich in mineral and natural resources and home to large amounts of industry, located in contemporary Poland. Since the middle ages, this territory was mainly inhabited by German tribes. After WW I, parts of Silesia were transferred to the Second Polish Republic notwithstanding that the majority of the population of all of Upper Silesia wished to remain part of Germany. It is interesting that after Warsaw began to keep a stiff upper lip in the question of deployment of missile defense system, the Library of Congress (US) all of a sudden officially registered the Silesian language in its list of languages. It is worth pointing out that the Alliance of Population of Silesian Nation and the Silesian Autonomy Movement had been seeking official recognition of the language for almost a decade! Is it a coincidence? I don't think so as the Silesian language was not even mentioned in the Law on National Minorities that got adopted in Poland a few years ago. Now, after the Silesian language is in the list of languages of the Library of Congress, it will go hard with Polish authorities. The Silesian Autonomy Movement feels support of Washington, that's why Silesia and territorial integrity of Poland in the whole is a subject of bargain and intimidation from the side of Washington that might become a good pushing tool in dealing the matter of missile defense system deployment in Poland.",

   "Three American Navy servicemen beat up polish taxi driver! What an outrage! The longer American servicemen are staying in Poland the more impudently they behave! The case of the beaten-up taxi driver is very indicative! Americans set us at naught! Of course many of us are very displeased with avaricious taxi drivers in Trojmiescie but no one tries to beat them up because we all honor the law! As for American servicemen, they don't respect either Polish laws, or Polish constitution because they know they know they can do what ever they want with impunity! Impunity - that is their trump-card! While we like jackals #### in our own pocket, almost licking their boots and digest what Americans doing to us! Obnoxiously! I wonder what going to happen when they deploy the countermissile defence here. That's when American servicemen will be on the loose because they will know that we have no escape. I have a solving for this problem - Poland should be having its own strong army, Wojsko Polskie. That antimissile defence base should be also Polish - not American! American servicemen should only be allowed to use our antimissile defence base - not own it! Only in this case Washington will start to treat Republic of Poland as an equal partner and US servicemen will be more disciplined and law-abiding! In case Washington does not agree - we say \"Yankee Go Home!\"",

   "&#1053;&#1077;&#1091; folks. I guess we need some more brain upstairs in European governments. I bet you that crazy idea called Community Gas Rings has been prompted by \"expert guys\" resident in Langley. The grand idea is gas supplies for Europe from Africa and Iran. The latter may be easily made licking our boots and begging to get its gas for a song.... once under American missiles based in Europe! LOL \n D'you actually believe into American altruism? Me not! But they this is be no doubts smart going of theirs! Firstly, European interest in American antimissiles in European countries is guaranteed. Secundly? Europe may be downgraded by her own effort! Islamic terrorists will make life in European countries Hades. Sure thing. What else? It'll come hell costly amid lack of any safety! Guys in Langley and D.C. will be happy. No doubts. Add here that their long lusted wish will come true with Europe and Russia falling apart at last. Lately it's been huge irritant for America that Russia is amassing wealth due to energy supplies to Europe which in its turn is steadily developing to overpass USA soon (would be worst nightmare in White House). Really for Americans Gas Ring is quite the solution!",
