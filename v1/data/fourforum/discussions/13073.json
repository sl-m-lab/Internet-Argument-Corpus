How do they justify that, Biblically speaking?\n \n Just what are they teaching in Black churches today, and is anybody listening? Let's also bring Bill Cosby into the fray for discussion.\n\n \n To grabble with the questions you pose, you must first trace the history of the American Civil Rights movement, the laws that were created, and how they were enacted and enforced. It is also imperative that the approach must be made with indifference to race.\n \n Although Lyndon Baines Johnson is given credit for signing the 1964 Civil Rights Act, very little is published about the fact that during the debates over the 1957 Civil Rights Act, Johnson and 98% of ALL DEMOCRATS voted against it. Including the former KKK Grand Wizard himself Democrat Sen. Robert Byrd, WV.\n \n After Kennedy's assassination, Johnson made the Civil Rights Act a priority, partly because he correctly felt that equality for blacks was inevidible, and partly because the Vietnam War was becoming a bigger issue and he did not want the distractions of civil unrest.\n \n What is not known is that Johnson was a racist through and through and he did not hide it. Our public schools like to omit this fact. He often referred to his driver by the \"n\" word and was not apologetic about it.\n \n Fast forward. Lack of education for black americans, allowed welfare laws to be drafted that in essence exchanged iron shackles for economic ones for the majority of black america.\n \n These laws, drafted by Democrats and fiercly rejected by Republicans required that anyone receiving government aid could not have a male in the house that could earn a living. Futhermore, you could increase your allotment of government aid by having more children. Biblically speaking, take the man out of the house, and you will destroy the family. Young men grow up full of hatred and anger, and young women grow up seeking affection from any source to replace the father that was never there. \n \n Fast forward some more. Black Leadership.\n \n Jessie Jackson, Al Sharpton, Jeremiah Wright, Malcom X, (before he changed his message and was killed for it), Louis Farakhn(sp).., without exception have needed to \"feed the hate\" in order to remain in a leadership position and take the money from the followers. All of them preached an anti-zionist message and with little resistance from \"white\" leadership have been successful in keeping the racial barriers alive and well here in America.\n \n James Cone is the father of Black Liberation Theology which is a complete distortion of scripture. He teaches that the white \"devil\" (all whites) are here to oppress the black person and that God and the \"black\" Jesus will liberate the black community and bind the \"devils\" once and for all.\n \n There are many in leadership positions within the black community who stand to lose everything if we could possibly attain a racist free society.",

I think it's a fair question.\n\n \n First, let me make it clear that certain policies of the last 45+/- years have reeked havoc on the black community by making many multi-generational families dependent on the govt. And I agree that many racial groups are often almost lemming like in their support of candidates based solely on race (or some other unimportant characteristic).\n \n But almost 80%+ of the black vote goes to the Democrat candidate regardless of race, so we're really not talking about too much of a deviation from the norm. And you've gotta admit that there must be a sense of racial pride and a powerful drive to put the past behind (many blacks still alive remember not being able to even vote). Now, I disagree with Obama on probably 85% of the issues and I wish that more of his supporters would look critically at the politic of socialism and the newfound hatred of success. I also think that there's a lot of hypocrisy esp. on the left (though the right has plenty too). But you've got to give the blacks this one...they finally got one of 'their own' and its, I'm sure a terrific sense of accomplishment. You really can't fault them on this one.",

We've shown on other threads that some Christian sects are outrageous (WBC comes to mind), voting for someone for one characteristic without thought for anything else is about the same thing that the Blacks did (though, as I said, the one characteristic is usually the D next to their name lol)",
