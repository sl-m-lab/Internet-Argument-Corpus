   "I have said it before and I will say it again. Before you guys started all of this gun ban nonsense, no one wanted the military look alike guns. But you banned them! They became rare and therefore their value skyrocketed. Then everyone wanted one. A market you Anti-gun nuts created. \n \n When the ban lifted, everyone had to have one, and EVERYONE bought one. However, in doing so, people also found out that the AR series were more accurate for hunting and target shooting, and a much more reliable design than previous hunting rifles. Now hunting and target rifles utilize this reliable accurate design. It is called progress. What the rifle looks like has little to do with the shooting and hunting process. It is Just a Better gun, the same semi auto action, but a better more accurate, and more reliable design. Plain and simple. \n \n Yes, most rifles today ARE the Military look alike, but without the Full Auto capabilities that define an actual Quote Assault Weapon. \n \n Rifles and murder from the FBI Uniform Crime Reports.   These figures are for all rifle homicides, not just the so-called Assault Weapons. \n\n \n All Rifles not just so called assault weapons. \n 2003 = 392 Equaling .027 of all murders\n 2004 = 403 Equaling .028 of all murders \n 2005 = 445 Equaling .029 of all murders \n 2006 = 438 Equaling .029 of all murders \n 2007 = 450 Equaling .03 of all murders\n   2008 = 380 \n 2000 = 348 \n \n Some other categories. \n \n Personal weapons (hands, fists, feet, etc.)\n 2003 = 962 \n 2004 = 943 \n 2005 = 905 \n 2006 = 841 \n 2007 = 854\n   2008 = 875 \n 2009 = 801\n \n Blunt objects (clubs, hammers, etc.)  \n 2003 = 650\n 2004 = 667 \n 2005 = 608 \n 2006 = 618 \n 2007 = 647\n   2008 = 603 \n 2009 = 611\n \n Knives or cutting instruments  \n 2003 = 1,828 \n 2004 = 1,866 \n 2005 = 1,920 \n 2006 = 1,830 \n 2007 = 1,796\n   2008 = 1,888 \n 2009 = 1,825 \n\n \n   For the actual difference between these guns and a Real Assault Weapon see this video. \n \n Soooooooo You were saying?",

   "No Brady you are very incorrect. Besides being incorrect you are using hyperbole and political rhetoric to try and establish a case that does not exist. I have read your post and I am unable to find a single example of the truth being used. Nothing you've said would survive under the test of scrutiny. Attempting to have a discussion with you would be an exercise in futility. Rather your claim will be picked apart and ridiculed.\n \n \nWidespread Sale of Military-Style Weapons Drives Illicit Traffic to Mexico, Increases Armed Attacks on U.S. Law Enforcement Officers, and Facilitates Mass Shootings\n \n Washington, DC--As the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform focuses on alleged failures of the U.S. Justice Department&#8217;s program to stop gun trafficking to Mexico, a new study by the Violence Policy Center (VPC) identifies the major force driving the criminal cross-border gun traffic: the gun industry&#8217;s cynical militarization of the U.S. civilian gun market.\n\n \n No Brady, quite erroneous and intentionally false. The professional soldiers, hit men, police, assassins and politicians of the drug cartels in Mexico were not sitting around peacefully from 1994 to 2004, before one day deciding that illegally acquiring arms from America's civilian market would be all they needed to gain control of the country. They weren't motivated to sneak massive amounts of marijuana, cocaine and other illicit substances across the border by the truckload for the sole purpose of acquiring enough money to buy civilian arms from gun stores in America.\n \n The existence of AR-15s and AK-47s on the open market did not motivate the drug cartel to do anything. They were not peaceful entrepreneurs who simply saw an opening to exploit to their advantage.\n \n \n&#8220;Today, militarized weapons--semiautomatic assault rifles, 50 caliber anti-armor sniper rifles, and armor-piercing handguns--define the U.S. civilian gun market and are far and away the &#8216;weapons of choice&#8217; of the traffickers supplying violent drug organizations in Mexico&#8221; the study, \"The Militarization of the U.S. Civilian Firearms Market\" (http://www.vpc.org/studies/militarization.pdf), finds. The study also finds that the gun industry has become so dependent on militarized product lines that 11 of the top 15 gun manufacturers now market assault weapons, adding that &#8220;...the gun industry designs, manufactures, imports, and sells firearms in the civilian market that are to all intents and purposes the same as military arms. It then bombards its target market with the message that civilian consumers--just like real soldiers--can easily and legally own the firepower of militarized weapons.&#8221;\n\n \n Perhaps you could elaborate on just why this is a problem in today's age when it wasn't a problem in previous times when the definition of military weapons was different.\n \n \n* Identical to sophisticated battlefield weapons used by the armed forces of the United States and other countries, such as the Barrett 50 caliber anti-armor sniper rifle.\n\n \n You say this. Yet I can find no information that would suggest the Barrett rifle was manufactured for military sales, rather than simply adopted later on. The Barrett M82 was available to the civilian market in 1982, with the very first military use not occurring until 1989. That makes it a civilian rifle that was later adopted by the military, rather than the other way around.\n \n \n* Slightly modified variants of military firearms that would otherwise be illegal to sell on the civilian market, including semiautomatic versions of military assault weapons, such as civilian AR-15 and AK-47 assault rifle models.\n\n \n Kindly elaborate on what is defined as \"slightly modified\" in this context.\n \n \n* Weapons capable of defeating body armor, specially designed for police and counter-terrorism units, such as the FN Herstal Five-seveN 5.7mm pistol.\n\n \n Perhaps you would care to explain just why this is a bad thing. Is the designated armor piercing ammunition available for civilian sale? Do you believe the criminals don't wear body armor themselves?\n \n \n&#8220;Your grandfather&#8217;s shotgun has no place in today&#8217;s civilian gun market,&#8221; said the study&#8217;s author, VPC Senior Policy Analyst Tom Diaz.\n\n \n Hyperbole and emotional rhetoric. What amounts to \"your grandfather's shotgun\" is likely no different than the type of shotgun used by the military for specialized combat. Would you care for a list of the various types of shotguns used by just the American military since World War One?\n \n The statement of Tom Diaz is equally erroneous based on the current market. No company would manufacture and try to sell a $1,200 double barreled shotgun is there were no demand for such. A quick search of an online firearms retailer site reveals that no less than 24 different variants of this platform are selling for well over this price. That hardly suggests \"Your grandfather's shotgun has no place in today's civilian gun market.\" www.galleryofguns.com - Gun Genie - Davidson's most popular and powerful search engine to find and buy guns at galleryofguns.com\n \n \n&#8220;The gun industry has created a unique American civilian firearms bazaar which arms thousands of criminals, dangerous extremists, and drug traffickers throughout the world. If Congress wants to find the real causes of the gun traffic to Mexico, it needs to look upstream to the gun industry&#8217;s callous transformation of the American gun market into one more suited to warfare than sport. The world&#8217;s bad guys come here for their guns because they are cheap and plentiful.&#8221;\n\n \n Evidence that can be substantiated with hard facts would be most beneficial in this matter. Perhaps something from a site such as wikileaks that would show the gun industry is actively seeking out new criminal markets to invade and saturate with weapons that would make them liable for criminal prosecution.\n \n \nThe study describes how, plagued by declining gun ownership and the explosion of recreational alternatives such as electronic games, the faltering gun industry has relied on creating demand by designing and selling increasingly lethal military-style firepower.\n\n \n This sentence alone contains for more rhetoric and hyperbole than any other part of your cited source. What do electronic games have to do with anything in this matter? How has the gun industry supposedly generated new and sustaining demand for new designs if the ownership rates are declining? How is a gun made \"increasingly lethal\" when compared to other designs?\n \n Do you have anything to offer in response? Anything constructive in nature?\n \n \nAmong the myriad lethal results of the gun industry&#8217;s profit-driven choices, the study reports: &#8220;Semiautomatic assault weapons--especially inexpensive AK-47 type imports--are increasingly used in attacks against law enforcement officers in the United States.&#8221; \n VPC - The Violence Policy Center - U.S. Civilian Gun Market Has Become a Militarized Bazaar, New Violence Policy Center Study Documents (06/14/2011)\n\n \n Simply because something might be used against the police in a criminal manner does not lend credibility to the notion that it should be restricted to the citizenry that makes up the country; especially if they were acquired in a criminal manner that cannot be made subject to new rules.\n \n Keep in mind the ATF has been accused of trafficking thousands of weapons to known gun and drug smugglers and then losing track of them. What reason do you have for not laying fault with them?",

No facts, no links but eagerly quoted by you in your haste to demonize a fundamental Consitutional right embedded in also the 14th Amendment which neither you nor he care much for, kind of like the Norway shooter and his manifesto ain't it?\n \n \nThe study describes how, plagued by declining gun ownership and the explosion of recreational alternatives such as electronic games, the faltering gun industry has relied on creating demand by designing and selling increasingly lethal military-style firepower.\n \n Among the myriad lethal results of the gun industry's profit-driven choices, the study reports: \"Semiautomatic assault weapons--especially inexpensive AK-47 type imports--are increasingly used in attacks against law enforcement officers in the United States.\" \n VPC - The Violence Policy Center - U.S. Civilian Gun Market Has Become a Militarized Bazaar, New Violence Policy Center Study Documents (06/14/2011)\n\n \n It appears that you, scott, your mother's dot org. idiotic CF have overlooked some key points in the events governed by politics you so vehemently spew trying to lay the blame on the Constitution and FF of this Republic.\n \n Meanwhile the true enemies of this Nation are examining the facts you wish would vanish: Guns for Mexican cartels\n \n Our political appointees, administration and sundry cheerleaders appear to have manufactured the whole fast and furious gunwalker scandle to, by slight of hand and criminal behavior, make it appear that somehow citizens of this Republic were to blame for the claims they took pains to manufacture and conspire to break the law and commit impeachable offenses. Not too different from the Norway situation where in your haste to interpret the events as political is an excuse to blame anyone but the guilty parties.\n \n Simple truth is you would rather spread propaganda and detract from the events where a bunch of kids were attacked and killed by a person you know was impersonating a police officer, someone you claim should be trusted...the kids trusted him all right and had no firearms for self-defense. It is laying on your doorstep, just as fast and furious and gunwalker are laying at your doorstep and anti Constitutional attacks on an UNaliernable right which is evident the FF were wise indeed.\n \n You overlook the obvious in your haste to demonize anyone that is right and you only have to refute the facts here and dispense with your screed of propaganda:\n \n 1) Norway: A Postscript | Power Line\n Stopped by being shot by a SWAT TEAM member, ended with protection by gun....\n \n 2) Norway terror attacks illustrate observable truths - National gun rights | Examiner.com\n All of you psychos have a go at refuting the talking points here by Mr. Codrea which will remove your political fantasy and reduce your propaganda to reality.\n \n 3) That \"military bazaar\" was conducted for political reasons against Constitutional Rule Of Law. When you have gov't agents selling weapons killing at least two federal agents and over 500 Mexican law enforcement and military from THEIR OWN SMUGGLING and that of New Mexico MAIG Mayors and their city council and police forces selling real military equiptment including explosives and advanced military weapons inteded to protect this country not to commit treason and turn those weapons against it.\n \n You manufacture 'facts' out of the blue in a scenario appoved by the Secretary of State, appointed and elected officials and political hacks like VPC and brady campaigns with propaganda intended to mislead, misrepresent and overthrow the Constitution. You transfer the criminality to honesT citizens some of who are set up believing, just like Norway, that you can trust the police and DOJ, ATF, AND OTHERS IN THE ADMINISTRATION. This reeks but you continue on spouting propaganda and ignoring facts.\n \n When the congress committe gets through with government perps, they immediately should begin to investigate and dispense justice for the cheerleaders who condone AND attempt to excuse such activities.\n \n Your comments are screen captured and will come back to haunt you; perhaps you should learn to think before you speak and learn to use facts and speak the truth instead of trying to demonize anyone you think is \"different\" from you? Remember you are acting like \"everyone in the world is crazy except for you\". Know what that means? emoticon_xclown",
